 #Diplomatic Events
 komidiplo.1.t: "Komi Requests Closer Relations"
 komidiplo.1.d: "Our diplomats have received a surprising message today.Ever since the so-called Komi Republic illegally split from the West Russian Revolutionary Front, relations between our two governments have been tense. Now, under a communist government, the Komi Republic has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"
 komidiplo.1.a: "Let us bury the hatchet, and pursue warmer relations with the Republic."
 komidiplo.1.b: "These splitters have the gall to come crawling back? Ignore them."
 
 komidiplo.2.t: "A United Front"
 komidiplo.2.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. They have agreed to pursue warmer relations with our Republic. The current hostility between our governments shall cease, and communism shall once more present a united front against fascism! We are glad to see that our fellow comrades will not let bad blood betray the Revolution. Hopefully this is just the start of a mutually beneficial relationship between our two governments..."
 komidiplo.2.a: "We are glad that cooler heads have won the day."

 komidiplo.3.t: "A Split Front"
 komidiplo.3.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, with a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front's government. Unfortunately, it seems their government still sees us as hostile to their cause. They have denounced our government as illegal splitters who betrayed the Front in Russia's darkest hour. The West Russian Revolutionary Front have effectively barred our diplomats from their government, and some advisors believe war may be on the horizon."
 komidiplo.3.a: "It seems old grudges are more important to them than the Revolution."

 komidiplo.4.t: "Shared Training Exercises?"
 komidiplo.4.d: "Ever since we began pursuing peaceful relations with the Komi Republic, their diplomats have become frequent visitors to Arkhangelsk. Today their message is different, however. The Komi diplomats come bearing a request from their government to cross-train our troops and theirs. The Republic will send over some officers to our military bases, and in exchange we will send some in return.\n\nIf we agree to their request, we will have to spare valuable officers and risk military information leaking to unwanted sources. However if we refuse we may offend the Komi government and risk damaging relations irreparably. Do we accept the request?"
 komidiplo.4.a: "Cross-training our troops can only be beneficial to our goals."
 komidiplo.4.b: "We can not spare the manpower, we must unfortunately decline."

 komidiplo.5.t: "Fighting Together"
 komidiplo.5.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, but they have not returned alone. Several officers have arrived in preparation for the shared training exercises, much to the delight of our government. Hopefully their advice will aid in raising the effectiveness of our military, and provide new insight into military doctrine that our officers may have neglected. Of course, we shall send over several of our own officers immediately, as agreed upon. It seems our relationship with the West Russian Revolutionary Front is beginning to bear fruit..."
 komidiplo.5.a: "...and may our relationship continue to bear fruit in the future."

 komidiplo.6.t: "The Front Declines"
 komidiplo.6.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Arkhangelsk, bearing a message from the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Their government claims they can not spare the manpower to undergo shared training exercises, as they claim to require every officer they can get their hands on. Their government apologizes for their refusal, but claim their hands are tied, and such a request simply isn't feasible at this time."
 komidiplo.6.a: "Hopefully they may change their minds in the future..."

 komidiplo.7.t: "Komi Requests An Alliance"
 komidiplo.7.d: "Diplomats from Syktyvkar once again come to our government bearing a request. The Komi Republic requests a formal guarantee from our government, to last until the threat of reactionaries is purged from the immediate area. They wish to ensure the safety of their people, and believe our military could provide the defenses necessary to secure the Republic's position.\n\nSome within our government believe we can't afford to defend both Komi's territory and our own, and that we must decline such a request at this time. They also argue this deal does not sufficiently benefit our government, and that this relationship with Komi is an unequal one. Others within our government believe guaranteeing the Komi Republic's safety could allow us to gain a valuable and trusted ally, and that our military is large enough to spare the men and equipment for such a request."
 komidiplo.7.a: "A formal guarantee is in our best interests, tell them we shall protect each other."
 komidiplo.7.b: "We can not afford to defend them, they must secure their position themselves."

 komidiplo.8.t: "Mutual Protection"
 komidiplo.8.d: "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear good news. The West Russian Revolutionary Front has agreed to formally guarantee our government. This mutual protection guarantee will place our Republic in a much safer and stronger position. We are glad our allies are willing to cooperate to such an extent, and this partnership has once again proven its worth. In such turbulent times, it is comforting to know that we have such a dependable ally backing us."
 komidiplo.8.a: "We are now a truly united front!"

 komidiplo.9.t: "Alone Once More"
 komidiplo.9.d: "Our diplomats return once more from Arkhangelsk, and they bear bad news. It appears the West Russian Revolutionary Front has refused our request for a formal guarantee of our safety. They claim to be unable to spare the manpower and equipment to defend us at the moment. Not only is our government disappointed by this decision, this decision has disappointed the people of our Republic. If the West Russian Revolutionary Front can't commit to defending their allies, then why ally with them at all? Maybe they will change their minds in the future, but as it stands relations with Arkhangelsk have taken a heavy blow."
 komidiplo.9.a: "Komi stands alone once more."

 komidiplo.10.t: "Allied Pragmatism"
 komidiplo.10.d: "Although the alliance with our ideological brethren in Komi was, of course, valuable to the state both diplomatically and in terms of deterring foreign aggression, it now presents us with a pragmatic issue, as they have now gone to war with the Tsarists based in and around Vyatka.\n\nNaturally, many in our government are adamant that we have both a moral and doctrinal obligation to support our communist brethren against reactionary forces, and should therefore immediately join in their war effort. Others agree with this sentiment in principle, but are wary of a potential intervention by other reactionary elements while our forces are deployed on the front lines.\n\nThis is not an unrealistic fear - we must always be vigilant against the enemies of the Revolution, and there truly are very many such enemies. But is this fear worth potentially being seen as betraying one of the very few geopolitical 'friends' our state has?\n\nRegardless of choice, a decision must be made by the state's leadership, and it must be made soon."
 komidiplo.10.a: "We must fulfill the terms of the alliance. Follow Komi to war with Vyatka."
 komidiplo.10.b: "We must defend ourselves first. Make excuses, and do not get involved."

 komidiplo.11.t: "Komi's Request"
 komidiplo.11.d: "We have received a diplomatic mission from quite an unexpected state, and that is the socialist Komi Republic situated to our east. Ever since they managed to secure their rule over their own borders, the leftists that finally dominated politics in Syktyvkar have turned outwards, and now seek to expand in the rest of Russia. Of course, we are a hurdle to their expansion, but they have not immediately taken up their arms to invade.\n\nAn offer has been made, and that is for our two republics to merge into one. According to Komi's statements, unification could be achieved as we have common goals. Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again. We need to make a choice, or else we will soon have none"
 komidiplo.11.a: "Agree to their deal."
 komidiplo.11.b: "Reject the offer, we do not support socialism."
 
 komidiplo.12.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.12.d: "Vologda has finally endorsed socialism and its principles by joining the proud Komi Republic, after a short period of integration. After seeing the advantages we have to offer, and how successful we have been, it would be logical for any warlord regime to join us. And they, despite their suspected anti-communist sentiments seeing as they were a despotist military junta, have accepted. As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move. Even if some are opposed to this, another warlord state has embraced communism."
 komidiplo.12.a: "A victory for the proletariat!"

 komidiplo.13.t: "Vologda Declines"
 komidiplo.13.d: "Even though some had voiced their concerns on the military government of Vologda and their possible reluctance to join us, we decided to take the chance and make an open offer, since we had nothing to lose. But it seems that, in the end, they were right. As they wish to maintain their neutrality, Vologda has explicitly refused to surrender to our communist regime. As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time. At least, that's what the High Command claims. Thus, we can no longer delay the invasion of Vologda."
 komidiplo.13.a: "To arms, comrades!"

 komidiplo.14.t: "An 'Offer' of Integration"
 komidiplo.14.d: "The Foreign Ministry has informed us that, earlier today, a message was received from the government in Komi concerning the integration of our state with theirs.\n\nThough many within our government at first reacted with confusion, as the context of the 'offer' became clear, sentiment darkened rapidly. It is now clear that those in Komi intend to absorb our state entirely. Peacefully if possible but, as this communication proves, with force if necessary. They will not take no for an answer.\n\nAnd, yet, an answer must be given. What shall it be?"
 komidiplo.14.a: "We do not stand a chance. We must submit to annexation and integration."
 komidiplo.14.b: "Never! We secured our independence one - we can do so again."
 
 komidiplo.15.t: "A Successful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.15.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as many in our government and military advised us would be the case, a reluctant yet inevitable acceptance.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria opposed this decision, preferring to challenge our rising supremacy and fight to the bitter end. Fortunately for them, cooler heads prevailed, and we can now begin the process of annexing their lands.\n\nWhile also saving our strength - both economically and militarily - for the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.15.a: "They made the right choice. For us, of course."

 komidiplo.16.t: "An Unsuccessful 'Offer'"
 komidiplo.16.d: "The dispatch of the Foreign Ministry to the government in Bashkiria, concerning their submission and integration into the state, has returned. With, as only some in our government and military believed would be the case - owing to the sheer insanity of it - a stern refusal.\n\nIt is known that many senior figures within Bashkiria supported this decision, resolving themselves to oppose submission of any kind, and fight to the bitter end. It is most unfortunate, as now we will need to fight to secure their lands.\n\nWhile victory is inevitable, the damage upon the territory that will be inflicted will take time and resources to fix - which would have been much better spent towards the no doubt many conflicts to come."
 komidiplo.16.a: "They chose... poorly. As they will immediately learn."

 komidiplo.17.t: "Komi Offers Integration"
 komidiplo.17.d: "The socialist state of Komi, believing we have much in common and share common beliefs and ideologies, has decided to peacefully approach us. Messengers from Syktyvkar relayed the offer the Republic has made, and that is the re-integration of Gorky and the army it possesses into their socialist state.\n\nThis offer, while it would end our sovereignty, could prove to be beneficial for us. First of all, we do in fact believe in the revolution as well, and as such Komi's ideology is aligned to our own. Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi. Their reasons vary, from small differences in socialist doctrine, to the simple reluctance to simply give the precious city of Gorky away to someone else. Still, a final decision will have to be made."
 komidiplo.17.a: "Join with our socialist brothers!"
 komidiplo.17.b: "We cannot be annexed by them, reject the offer!"
 
 komidiplo.18.t: "Gorky Accepts Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.18.d: "This day marks a victory for socialism in West Russia, as Gorky has welcomed Komi's government with open arms. Seeing the similarities we share, and eager to see the motherland strong and reunited under a leftist government to fight the German menace, the military government agreed to unify with us.\n\nA joint military parade was organized in the streets of Gorky, outside of the massive tank factory. Thousands came to see it, and celebrate the unification of the two regimes, further demonstrating the popularity we have in the city. Furthermore, the city's army, well known for its use of armoured fighting vehicles to a great extent, has clearly demonstrated its loyalty to Komi, not only through the parade but through willingly joining with our own Red Army and beginning their integration into the High Command. Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a: "Workers of the world, unite!"

 komidiplo.19.t: "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d: "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."
 komidiplo.19.a: "Let's hope we succeed."

 komidiplo.20.t: "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d: "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a: "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b: "We must refuse. We can go on our own."

 komidiplo.21.t: "Vologda Accepts our Request!"
 komidiplo.21.d: "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a: "Just as planned."
 
 komidiplo.22.t: "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d: "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."
 komidiplo.22.a: "Vologda will stand on its own."

 komidiplo.23.t: "A Gift from the Republic"
 komidiplo.23.d: "We received a message from the Komi Republic this morning, something that becomes more frequent as we strengthen our alliance. It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe "aid pack", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."
 komidiplo.23.a: "Let's send them our own aid."

 komidiplo.24.t: "Freedom of Movement"
 komidiplo.24.d: "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a: "Open the borders."

 komidiplo.25.t: "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d: "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."
 komidiplo.25.a: "Clearly, Komi is unable to communicate their true intentions."
 komidiplo.25.b: "Accept the offer, for a democratic Russia!"

 komidiplo.26.t: "Vologda Declines!"
 komidiplo.26.d: "Unbelievably enough, the neutral zone of Vologda has refused to bow down to our authority! In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."
 komidiplo.26.a: "This is what happens to traitors."

 komidiplo.27.t: "Vologda Votes to Join Komi!"
 komidiplo.27.d: "Celebrate, citizens of Komi! Today, Vologda joins our republic!\n\nThe offer for merging the administrations has been welcomed by the semi-authoritarian government in Vologda. It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."
 komidiplo.27.a: "This is truly a day of joy."

 komidiplo.28.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.28.d: "We have received a curious message today. Diplomats from the so-called Komi Republic, which now borders our free state, have sent us an offer that is not to be taken lightly. They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react. They may opt for a more direct approach to our annexation..."
 komidiplo.28.a: "Our independence is not up for debate!"
 komidiplo.28.b: "It is for the best that we join them."

 komidiplo.29.t: "Tatarstan Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.29.d: "Bad news from our diplomats in Tatarstan. Their arrogant government has outright refused our well-intentioned annexation proposal, and have strongly insisted upon their status as an independent state! Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long. Once the dust has settled, a period of occupation will begin to ensure the annexation process goes smoothly."
 komidiplo.29.a: "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this."

 komidiplo.30.t: "Tatarstan Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.30.d: "Good news from our diplomats in Tatarstan! The Tatars have agreed to our generous offer of annexation, and have reached out to us to formalize their integration into our republic. Their little nation, including their politicians and armed forces, are expected to join the fold shortly. An autonomous Tatar republic will soon be established within our borders, but most importantly we have managed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed despite these turbulent times."
 komidiplo.30.a: "Diplomacy has won the day!"

 komidiplo.31.t: "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.31.d: "Ever since the forces of the Komi Republic had arrived at our borders, it was only a matter of time before they would attempt diplomatic overtures. That day has finally arrived, and diplomats representing Komi come bearing an offer that we would do well to consider. They are offering us a great deal of autonomy under their protection, as well as a place in their democratic political systems. Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a: "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."
 komidiplo.31.b: "No, they are not to be trusted!"
 
 komidiplo.32.t: "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d: "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a: "They leave us no choice."

 komidiplo.33.t: "Bashkiria Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d: "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a: "The pen is mightier than the sword."

 komidiplo.34.t: "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d: "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a: "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b: "Our road is ours to tread."

 komidiplo.35.t: "Vyatka Agrees to Cooperate"
 komidiplo.35.d: "Today, the forces of anti-Bolshevism make a great step in defeating even the last pocket of red in the free Russian territories. The message we have sent to the warlord state of Vyatka, vaguely aligned with our ideological goals, has received a positive reply. Likely coming to the realization that we are one of their few hopes for survival and flourishing in the region, they have been quick to voice their agreement for a mutual assistance pact.\n\nThe developments from the moment the reply was received have been surprisingly rapid. The minister of foreign affairs for our republic and their counterpart in Vyatka have come into contact, and are now in the process of scheduling the meeting in which the alliance will be officially signed. However, as often happens with these backdoor diplomatic arrangements, many of the points of the alliance have already been discussed behind the scenes.\n\nThe deal will include a promise that, should one signatory be attacked, the other will have to abide by the treaty and come to the aid of their ally. Limited military presence in the form of advisors and attachés will also likely be a term. Finally, a number of economic and military support between the two nations is more than likely to be included. From now on, Vyatka fiercely stands by us as our great ally."
 komidiplo.35.a: "Good to see we finally have some friends."

 komidiplo.36.t: "Vyatka Refuses our Offer"
 komidiplo.36.d: "When the telegram looking into the possibilities of an alliance with the monarchists to our south was sent to Vyatka, we expected that Tsar Vladimir would see how much we have in common, and how dire our situation is against numerous enemies. However, from what we can gather from the reply hastily sent by their own foreign office, the minute differences in our ideologies have been enough for them to reject the offer for an alliance, or at least justify doing so.\n\nOf course, we have been limited to our beliefs of the greatness of the Russian nation and its people, as well as their will to oppose the communists, the Germans, and all other enemies. We chose not to blindly follow the ideals of monarchism, that only appealed to the elite of the elite, and ignored the true will of the people of all classes. Despite the doubts by very few of the right's members, perhaps we were absolutely right in doing so.\n\nAny diplomatic channels and backdoors between Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka that remained open have been closed in the aftermath of what is perceived as a diplomatic betrayal, especially when the WRRF looms over us ominously. For all intents and purposes, all prospects of befriending the Tsarists have ended. From now on, the only diplomatic interaction we will ever have again will be their instrument of surrender when war inevitably comes between us and them."
 komidiplo.36.a: "Much more dangerous threats exist right now."

 komidiplo.55.t: "The West Russian United Front?"
 komidiplo.55.d: "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."
 komidiplo.55.a: "Pah! We will go our own way!"
 komidiplo.55.b: "Let us merge the two governments."
 
 komidiplo.58.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.58.d: "Over the past few weeks, our scouts have observed an increase of military activity on our borders with the state known as "Ust-Sysolsk"; a highly militaristic, far-right regime based in the lands formerly owned by the Komi Republic. The belligerent attitude this regime has held towards their neighbors has been cause for concern, and now it seems they are turning our sights towards our holy order.\n\nA message has been received this morning demanding our immediate submission. Should we accept, they would peacefully integrate our order into Ust-Sysolsk and bloodshed would be avoided at the expense of our own freedom. On the other hand, should we decline, it seems clear they would not shy away from military action..."
 komidiplo.58.a: "We have no choice but to submit."
 komidiplo.58.b: "These heretics do not deserve our fear!"

 komidiplo.59.t: "The Order Submits!"
 komidiplo.59.d: "As expected, the Order of Saint George has wilted in the face of our military might and decided it would be best to submit rather than risk a military confrontation. Our troops are already moving across the border into Gayny to ensure the integration process goes smoothly and without incident."
 komidiplo.59.a: "One more step on the road to unification."

 komidiplo.60.t: "The Order Stands Defiant!"
 komidiplo.60.d: "In an unexpected turn of events, the Order of Saint George has refused our demands and stands defiant even in the face of our overwhelming martial superiority. They are already reinforcing their borders and preparing for the inevitable conflict, but this effort is almost certainly futile. Our forces outnumber theirs by a considerable margin, and this war is not likely to take long."
 komidiplo.60.a: "Brave, but foolish."

 komidiplo.61.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.61.d: "Trouble on the horizon. The far-right regime based in Syktyvkar has long been a source of concern for us, and it seems their attention has finally been drawn to our neutral zone. Large forces of troops are massing on the border, and this worrying turn of events has coincided with a message to our foreign office.\n\nThe so-called state of "Ust-Sysolsk" demands the neutral zone's immediate submission and integration into their borders. Should we refuse, they have vaguely implied some kind of military action. Judging by the large presence of troops on our border, this threat is hardly a bluff. Shall we surrender and put the final nail in the neutral zone's coffin, or attempt to defend ourselves?"
 komidiplo.61.a: "We cannot possibly win. We must submit."
 komidiplo.61.b: "The neutral zone cannot fall!"
 
 komidiplo.62.t: "Vologda Submits!"
 komidiplo.62.d: "Unsurprisingly, the neutral government of Vologda has wisely decided to submit to our demands rather than subject their lands to the ravages of war. We shall begin the process of integration immediately, and our soldiers have already crossed the border to ensure our rule is solidified. "
 komidiplo.62.a: "Neutrality is overrated."

 komidiplo.63.t: "Vologda Refuses to Submit!"
 komidiplo.63.d: "The neutral zone of Vologda has, bafflingly, decided to defy our demands and refuse integration! They clearly do not understand that the odds are against them, and would rather risk a military confrontation than give up their misguided independence. Their army is woefully inferior compared to ours, and isn't expected to put up much resistance."
 komidiplo.63.a: "We will crush them!"

 komidiplo.64.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Breaks off Ties"
 komidiplo.64.d: "Worrying news from our supposed "allies" of Ust-Sysolsk. The government in Syktyvkar has decided, in defiance of any rational explanation, to nullify their treaty of mutual assistance with the Empire.\n\nWe can only guess why they've done this, but it is almost certainly because they desire our lands. Our scouts already report concerning troop movements across our borders, so we must be prepared for anything. If Ust-Sysolsk truly is planning to attack, we cannot afford to be caught off-guard."
 komidiplo.64.a: "We never should've trusted them!"

 komidiplo.65.t: "Ust-Sysolsk Demands our Submission!"
 komidiplo.65.d: "A message has been received from the neighboring statelet of Ust-Sysolsk, demanding in no uncertain terms for all our forces to stand down. This is hardly a bold-faced bluff on their part, as their armies have already mobilized to our borders in the event of our refusal.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation indeed. Should we surrender, there's no telling what will become of our soldiers, who have engaged in acts of banditry across the entire region. On the other hand, remaining defiant could result in far more death than if we were to just surrender..."
 komidiplo.65.a: "Perhaps it is time to lay down our arms..."
 komidiplo.65.b: "We shall crush them beneath our treads!"

 komidiplo.66.t: "Gorky Surrenders!"
 komidiplo.66.d: "The bandit brigades of Gorky have wisely decided to surrender to our forces, no doubt coming to the conclusion that a conflict would result in their total destruction. Our troops have secured control over Gorky and its important mechanized factories without so much as a shot fired, and the integration of the region proceeds as planned."
 komidiplo.66.a: "How fortuitous."

 komidiplo.67.t: "Gorky Refuses!"
 komidiplo.67.d: "Unsurprisingly, the bandits of Gorky stand defiant in the face of our demands and are preparing to do battle with our forces. Despite having them outnumbered, the bandits' vast fleet of tanks may prove to be a challenging obstacle indeed. That being said, they cannot hope to hold out against our comparatively vast army for too long."
 komidiplo.67.a: "Those rusty tin cans do not scare us!"

 komidiplo.68.t: "A Letter to Tartarstan"
 komidiplo.68.d: "Our relations with the West Russian states that we reluctantly call our neighbors are limited, at best. In truth, the Tartarstan Republic finds little need for a world that has mostly abandoned it, and as our economy and workforce face the problems inherent to a newborn state, even that is steadily decreasing in importance. For the most part, we are alone, and we would be happy to stay that way.\n\nIt appears this isolation has now been forcibly ended.\n\nThe letter from the new leader of the Republic to our north has more to it than a mere notice of name-change: its new leader, Gumilyov, speaks to a union of flesh and steel that he envisions will one day stretch across the long band of the Urals. It is, in his defence, a very well-argued concept, even if it sounds like the babblings of a madman, and some on our soil have been noticeably swayed by the Pan-Eurasian siren. It does not help that the letter promises religious pluralism and respect for our ancient creed; our men are warriors of faith as well as champions of industry, and Gumilyov's promises of a minimal degree of respect are inherently appealing.\n\nUnfortunately, these promises inevitably come at a cost. Gumilyov calls for our righteous submission, and as he phrases it, "much will come of our work together - our place is one of humble leadership, and yours of loyal and righteous service". These are controversial words, and the best we can say about them is that they are not quite as bad as what we would expect from your average Russian Alexander-to-be."
 komidiplo.68.a: "God Willing, may our union bring glory to us both."
 komidiplo.68.b: "Rebuff these fools. Their words mean little."

 komidiplo.69.t: "The Instrument of Accession"
 komidiplo.69.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nThe Accession Instrument is simple: in exchange for privileged treatment as an ethnic minority following a noble creed, the Tatars shall swear political allegiance to us and fold their own government into ours. The Tatar economy shall also take marching orders from our own leadership, although it is in truth more difficult to constrain their thriving caravan economy than it would be to herd cats.\n\nOur Leader has expressed good cheer at this news, and he has issued a Pan-Eurasian call to unity to be read in the new territory's mosques. Surely the noble Moslems of the region will greet their new brothers with open arms..."
 komidiplo.69.a: "Glory to our brothers from Tatarstan!"

 komidiplo.70.t: "A Temporary Resistance"
 komidiplo.70.d: "The newborn Tatarstan Republic has proven as fierce in battle as they are enthusiastic in commerce. The Teacher has himself expressed reverence for their Eurasianist ethic in several speeches, and our State has been ready and willing to listen. Now the time has come for their entry into the glory that shall be their inheritance under our rule!\n\nUnfortunately, there have been complications in enlightening the Tatars as to the obvious benefits to their accession. We have received a stiffly-worded refusal in exchange, citing only "natural political and cultural concerns" as their primary reasons. Pah! The Teacher's embrace is all the political and cultural incentive these misguided Muhammedans could ever desire, and it is to their detriment that they are blind to our compassions.\n\nNo matter - the refusal is purely a temporary matter. Our divisions are preparing to bring the inevitability of Eurasian rebirth to Tatar soil. Let the grasses weep; we will join soil with soil regardless."
 komidiplo.70.a: "They will come to regret this."

 komidiplo.71.t: "Gumilyov's Invitation"
 komidiplo.71.d: "The land of Komi has been atumble with political intrigue for as long as can be remembered: now, however, something entirely new has emerged from the chaos, and the new leadership has set its sights on us. Their leader, Gumilyov, professes a strange creed proclaiming unity with all brothers and sisters of the land, and they have even sent us a strange advertisement proclaiming a common "base of faith, tolerance and ardor" - our imams are confused, to say the least, but they appreciate the proposal.\n\nQuestions of religious tolerance aside, we do not possess any illusions as to the true nature of their proposal. Gumilyov claims that our men and armaments will be subsumed into a larger cause, one that aims to bring unity to the steppes. What he conveniently neglects to mention is that this endeavour will require colossal amounts of bloodshed; much of it, no doubt, our own.\n\nSome on our soil, however, have found his beliefs persuasive: just the other day we had to lock up an itinerant preacher with some strange ideas about this Eurasianism, and a domestic crowd rallies to the defense of a Russia we thought dead decades ago. Opposing them is most of our domestic political establishment, the latter of whom believe Gumilyov's strange ideas regarding the Rus are merely proof that Ust-Sysolsk truly is a land for madmen.\n\nWell, madmen or not, we must decide. Unity or independence? Peace or war?"
 komidiplo.71.a: "Let us go with Gumilyov."
 komidiplo.72.b: "We stand alone!"
 
 komidiplo.72.t: "The Integration of Bashkiria"
 komidiplo.72.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nUfa is festooned with the banners of Eurasia today, bearing witness to the arrival of the Teacher Gumilyov - in his first public address to the new province, Gumilyov read verses from the Koran and promised to uphold a "staunch brotherhood and mutual respect" between all peoples. This was met with cheers from a mostly amused crowd, although a few upstart imams have also been arrested for trying to cause trouble. We are certain that the troublesome talk of resistance some of these incendiaries have seeded in the population will take some time to weed out as well...\n\nWell, it is not all bad news. The religious and political establishment of Ufa have already sworn allegiance to their new superiors, and the principles of Eurasian Fraternity have been successfully rolled out in the provincial education system. Military recruitment is also progressing as well as can be hoped, although the existing officer corps is taking longer than usual to accommodate our new oaths. Perhaps a visit from State Security is in order?\n\nWell, that is all I can report from Ufa this week. We congratulate the Teacher on his success - may Eurasia be reborn from the blood and resolve of our brothers!"
 komidiplo.72.a: "Glory to Gumilyov!"
 
 komidiplo.73.t: "Stubborn Fools!"
 komidiplo.73.d: "Report, Representative to Ufa, 19XX-XX-XX\n\nWe recognize now that our efforts to promote brotherhood and common cause between us and these damnable Bashkirians were doomed from the start; is it some peculiar fault of the constitution that engenders a lack of common sense? Is it a failed education system that causes the blindness of its leadership? Either way, the result is clear: Bashkiria has rejected our proposal for unity, and they have even gone so far as to expel our Consulate with your most humble servant included! What an insult to the Eurasian ideal, and to the Teacher himself!\n\nWe have succeeded in drawing perhaps a few hundred to the fold, and some have promised to leave this misguided land altogether to join the Leader, but there is little hope that this quasi-state will ever be persuaded to join us peacefully. Some of their most notable imams have thrown us a statement outright denying our tolerance and calling us the "spittle of Satan", in fact. Insults aside, we should not anticipate a peaceful occupation should we decide to militarily intervene.\n\nWe must prepare for the worst: eventually they will come to accept that our rule is a benevolent one, no matter how much blood is spent on their conviction."
 komidiplo.73.a: "Mere delays to the inevitable."

 komidiplo.74.t: "A Threat to Berezniki"
 komidiplo.74.d: "Kazembek's watching the guard escort the Eternal Loyalty convoy to the gates when the message comes. The sky is foggy and the wind gnaws at everything, such that the messenger's words are almost lost in the whirl:\n\n"Ust-Sytolsk wants our terms, Sir!"\n\nThere is little doubt what he means: Vyatka's active government has long warned of such a possibility. Ust-Sytolsk is run by an insane demagogue who demands the blood of his countrymen to spill in rivers for his deluded fantasy of Eurasianism, but it was believed his madness would gutter out long before he became a threat. Instead, his armies are here and an imminent threat.\n\nKazembek's meeting with his little cabinet is brief. All other options are denied them; Gumilyov demands submission or war, and there is no room for negotiation. Nor will this fight be anything but a fait accompli for the limited military strength of the statelet: they cannot hope to sustain more than a relentless retreat or a single, hopeless stand.\n\nThere is one last choice to be made, and no dignity in either option. Kazembek sighs, like something being released from his spirit, and chooses."
 komidiplo.74.a: "Submission."
 komidiplo.74.b: "War."
 
 komidiplo.75.t: "A Resignation"
 komidiplo.75.d: "Berezniki's choice is clear when the morning comes: the border garrison notes mass surrenders of border troops and a rapid breakdown of anything resembling coherent resistance. As the armies march into the statelet, they encounter a mostly subdued scene: thugs running People's Battalions pushing prisoners forth stop patrols and offer their charges to soldiers before running away, and villages offer only temporary rest and aid before shooing confused officers away.\n\nThe leadership having surrendered, its administrative apparatus begins the slow process of moving towards Gumilyov's own government, and there it receives a rude awakening. Civil servants and democratic dissenters trade homes and offices for the prison-camps, and there is nothing resembling fair trials for the intelligentsia already under arrest by the previous regime. Instead, for a select few who have earned the wrath of the Eurasianists, there is a bullet in the dead of night as the sum total of mercy offered.\n\nBerezniki dies with these quick arrests - the rest offer submission, and Gumilyov's regime is quick to begin the next step of ensuring loyalty. Young men are rounded up in squares and markets, the perennial harvest of all states, and offered the choice:"
 komidiplo.75.a: "Serve Eurasia or die for yourself."
 
 komidiplo.76.t: "A Simple Refusal"
 komidiplo.76.d: "Berezniki makes its stance clear in the dead of night: the envoy from Ust-Systolsk is expelled and his guard unceremoniously shot as a warning, and as he is taken back to the border by People's Battalions he records the following:\n\n"Watching a convulsion of violence erupt, from the safety of my truck: here and there bonfires and shouts, and I hear screams from the grasslands. They are rooting out sympathisers, some real, many imagined, and they intend to sear it out of them."\n\n"We are passing by the ruins of a village. The smell is fresh, acrid. Greasy. I ask: what happened to these people? The guard snorts and turns away, saying only: they opposed the People's Tsar."\n\n"For the first time since coming, I can no longer trust the honor of the Mladorossi. It is now apparent they are violent, angry people, and they cannot be trusted in peace any more than they can be offered mercy in war."\n\nThe report has been met by accusations of bias and outright fabrication by their own representative in our regime, but he has been expelled from the country as well: there will be no room to rebut this, and it does make a convenient narrative to rally around."
 komidiplo.76.a: "I'm not sure whether to believe this."

 komidiplo.56.t: "The WRRF Refuses!"
 komidiplo.56.d: "Excerpt from "On Deviationism: A Response to the West Russian Pseudo-Revolutionaries", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt is with deep disappointment, but no real surprise, that we discover the true nature of the so-called Arkhangelsk Socialists - or, as we now know them, the Arkhangelsk Junta. We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous Communist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism. We thank Arkhangelsk for this, and only this - because of their stubbornness, we have been inoculated from this disease once and for all."

 komidiplo.57.d: "Excerpt from "On Solidarity: A Response to the West Russian Comrades' United Front", Special Publication of the Komi ASSR\n\nIt was always to be expected that our brothers in arms would one day find us, their natural allies and equals, and it is with great joy that we announce that the inevitable has finally occurred. We look to the World with expectant eyes, and to the rest of our Motherland - if the generals of the Front hope to find in us the ideological strength and the collective will to undo the Undoing of the Nation, they can rest assured that they will find us more than sufficient.\n\nWe must not rest on our laurels, however. The time has come to use the massive armaments Arkhangelsk has gathered - the warlords around our scattered domains are restless. They see the march of history in their eyes. The time is coming when they will attempt to stop it.\n\nWe must simply beat them to the punch. Let us not be afraid of the future, comrades. The triumph was long delayed, but it, like the World Revolution, like the spinning of the world itself, will come one day. Only our resolve is required, that on that day we might stand in the hallowed ranks of the Martyrs and say:\n\nI was there when History needed me."

 komi_socdem.1.t: "경제 상태"
 komi_socdem.1.d: "Rodionov gazed at the hulking shell of the factory, lost as ever in thought. He was not a particularly expressive man, but occasionally he afforded his mind the luxury of imagination as a dog might be afforded a leash on a warm day. It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - Voznesensky had sent him here, on this 'fact-finding mission', to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins? Rodionov thought to the interviews he'd held with the townsfolk in the little village to the left. So few of them left, and so many empty houses. Gone with the money, or its lack, and the hope leached from their faces like a blanket sodden too long in bleach. The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting. Thick-woven cotton, a few buttons, a face and body and little cloth-knotted arms, and on the face a little smile - a child's doll, here in the ruins of Russian industry. If that wasn't symbolic, he didn't know what was."
 komi_socdem.1.a: "Much has been lost...but much can be rebuilt."
 
 komi_socdem.2.t: "Voznesensky's Speech"
 komi_socdem.2.d: "No one at the DSNP headquarters knew when the miners' protest letter made it to Voznesensky's office. Truth be told, that was probably the only reason why it got as far as his door in the first place - the DSNP had gotten past its worst day, but a residue of suspicion seemed to taint everything past the office doors these days. Even so, once the letter made it to Voznesensky there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon Voznesensky later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. Voznesensky seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to 'speak' directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling Voznesensky held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."
 komi_socdem.2.a: "Almost."
 
 komi_socdem.3.t: "Vox Populi, Vox Dei"
 komi_socdem.3.d: "The President eyed his opponents in much the same way that one would expect to eye a stray dog on the other side of the road: at a remove, but not quite removed enough for the disdain to wear off. The Unionist grimaced at his glance, but otherwise did nothing. It wasn't like he could do anything about the man with the popular mandate, after all.\n\nNow Voznesensky approached the topic of contention again, almost patient, like a schoolmaster feigning concern. "Alexei, I believe we have certain concerns your Union has failed to address - I am not a man enamoured of warding off the inevitable, so let us try again. Will you, or will you not, stand for a work-week reduction?"\n\nThe Unionist sighed, trotting out the same words he'd always trotted out to the faux-benevolent. "With all due respect, Mr. President, you simply don't understand the material conditions here. We are already treading on the ragged edge of our employers, and it would not do to anger -"\n\nAll at once Voznesensky was animated, almost snarling. Alexei reeled at the sight. "And there it is! How dare you comport yourself like a union man while you bow and scrape before your employers! What a travesty to the spirit of Unionism, and an insult to the ideals of our Nation!" Was it just him, or was there a gleam of triumph in the President's eyes? Was this sport to him?\n\nAs the men gathered around him clapped and jeered, Alexei covered his face with his hands. He'd lost the union's heart, and who knew if his successor would resist crumbling before the demands of the people? Or if the Company wouldn't expel them from the factory altogether? Voznesensky, shaking his hands, leaned in and whispered, as if delivering a final blow:"

He hadn't even agreed to the damned meeting, so why had the President authorized a 'mandatory getaway' from his duties in the Army to attend it? Presently a staffer, dressed in formal slacks, put on a painfully plastic smile and clapped for attention. "Gentlemen, I welcome you to the first meeting of the Republic Electoral Committee. Please, let us go around the table and say a little about where we come from and what we do."\n\nAs Korolkov listened, his face grew ever more set, and his heart chilled. He'd learned from young to tell when someone was speaking about something they didn't believe. Their eyes never met yours, or their words were oddly stilted or lilting. Something about the human voice was a consummate betrayer of intent. Every one of the members of the table had a voice that betrayed him. Their gazes were false, and when they spoke of the enthusiasm they shared for the Electoral Commission red flags began to appear before Korolkov's own mental gaze.\n\nKorolkov kept his voice level as he rose to speak, but on a sudden tide of conviction he decided to probe a little. "Gentlemen, I believe that we have only breached the surface, as it were. I wish to hear a little more about why Voznesensky chose you - for our common will must be built through our understanding of our individual purposes. What can we bring to democracy - and how can we bring it about?"\n\nThe men looked to him, then around them, and they began to laugh. One slapped the table, chuckling as he got the words out. "Oh, Korolkov, you're funny. You're right. Let's admit it, folks -" The man gestured expansively to a nodding audience. "We were picked because we stand to gain from it all. We don't need to pretend at fairness, and we won't. Democracy is when Voznesensky wants things done, right?"\n\nThe man leaned close, almost predatory in his sudden smile. "And the more he wants done - the more democratic his elections will be.""

But today her face is a little softer than usual, a little less set in its cast, and as she gestures for the class to sit her mind seems far away.\n\nKomorova begins to write on the whiteboard, three words: DEMOCRACY, SOCIALISM, RUSSIA. "Can anyone tell me what Democracy is?" Komorova's voice is stern and gentle in a fashion only seasoned educators can pull off. For once, the class is not silent before her gaze. One boy - Pavlovich, with the curly hair - raises his hand tentatively. She nods to him. "Yes, Pavlovich."\n\n"Demok - democracy is when people choose what they want to happen! Like when Dad and Mom choose between me and my brother to help at the shop!" Komorova nods approvingly. "That's right, Pavlovich. Very good. Democracy is when we choose the important things - not just who does the weekly chores, but also our leaders, what we dream about for our country. Our futures."\n\n"And Socialism is when the Government does things!" A voice rings from the back of the class, jubilant in its confidence. Dana. "My father says Shofarevich is right and that the - "\n\n"Your father is wrong, Dana. Socialism is a lot like when we divide apples at lunch. We give extra to those who might have less to eat, and when people can give extra slices from their own share we distribute those too. Because it's fair."\n\nKomorova smiles wanly.

You have heard my humor for a decade, should you now stoop to pretending that I am actually funny?\n\nIn any case, the payments must stop, and the robes that those payments bought must be shed with their loss.

This time was different. She was surrounded by her wards and these were tears of joy.\n\nWhen the German bomb destroyed the last history book, she feared the worst. Never would the children know of Rurik and his sons, or Alexander Nevsky's victory over the Teutonic Catholics. It wasn't simply the destruction of a book. It was the obliteration of their history. Then a man from the government came. He was short, balding, and had no smile. A perfect bureaucrat and a boring human being. Yet Katerina wished she picked up that tiny man and kissed him on the spot for what news he brought. New books! Not just reprints, badly copied ones at that, but actually new books with the latest in historical efforts. And not just for history, which had been lost in the bombing, but chemistry, math, biology, and the humanities.\n\n"Come children, come!" Katerina said, clapping her hands together. "Before we start our math lesson, let's read about a great and mighty Queen, mother of Rurik's grandchild, Olga of Kiev." She tapped the edge of the book, drumming up their innocent and avid excitement before reading.\n\nLater in the day she would bore them with numbers and talking about amoebas, which would help them in the future. But the past had been kept alive. What Russia once was had been kept alive. The taxes weren't simply going to bombs or bullets or bread, but making sure they had a future.

For most of her young life, the weekly trip to the town market had been something to avoid. The shopkeepers had been hostile and the shoppers angry. Arguments over weights and prices had often turned into scary shouting matches around her.\n\nThat scary market was now firmly a thing of the past, at least to Zora. For the first time she could remember, basic goods were plentiful. There were more smiles to be seen, fewer arguments, and most importantly, a plethora of new faces, stalls and goods on offer. It seemed every market day there was something new to see, smell or taste! The Shaurma she'd shared with her father last week still made her mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nAs they walked to the town square, she was running circles around her mother, nipping impatiently at her coat. Once the market came into view, her mother gave her a warm smile and a small coin. "Run along, Alsu, and enjoy yourself. Find me in front of old Mustafaev's stall in an hour's time." The words had barely left her mouth before the girl was running full sprint, off to find other excited girls and boys and to see, smell, taste and experience everything her 10 kopeks could buy."

In fact, there is no provision that allows it. The newly elected councilors will sit for the full four years," he answered in unaccented Tatar. The first half hour now spent making assurances that the failure to produce a majority was not due to the electorate doing something wrong, somehow, they were starting to get somewhere.\n\n"Since no party can command the council by themselves, they will have to work together. Many cities already do this. Sometimes they have stable alliances that rule together, sometimes the largest party builds different coalitions from issue to issue. Even President Kosygin has to listen to the other parties and work with them."\n\nHe was optimistic they could do it, too. He expected the SMR, as the largest party, would form a coalition with either the DSNP or the regional Voice of Tatary movement.

From coffee shops, libraries and nascent universities, ideas flowed to a public rapidly learning to discuss them openly. From factories and workshops, Russian and foreign the goods flowed, to city shops, town squares and village markets and a public eager to purchase them. And from citizen to citizen, to the benefit of all, was provided the basic needs of life. The country could only be great if it was good for all, only strong if it protected the weak.\n\nThere is much still left to do, and the road will be long and hard, but what we have suffered to come here will drive us onward.

Exhaustive in nature, they have been instantiated at every level of governmental administration, and reforms range from examinations of school density distributions, to the development of standardized testing measures, and more besides.\n\nHowever, perhaps the greatest achievement of the state in this regard has been the general agreement by all concerned parties that the quality of available education has sharply increased. Strenuous qualification standards, the focused attraction and repatriation of exiled and expatriate academics, and the provision of proper funding and equipment for scientific purposes, have all contributed to this.\n\nAlthough the level of the Republic's available academic offerings does not yet begin to approach that of more established localses, such as the Reich, the Sphere, or the United States, the gap is quickly closing.

Valery promised himself that once this was all over, he would take some time out of his schedule to speak some very deliberate words to the visual designer.\n\nWell, it wasn't like the logo was important. Taking his placard, Valery began the twenty-minute trek to his appointed District. He had at least gotten lucky with the placing: he'd heard some volunteers would have to stay overnight thanks to the travel time back and forth. As he arrived in the little park-square, he set up his placard next to a couple of chairs with a sign hung between lamp-lights: A CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY! ALL WELCOME!\n\nThe first to approach the improvised booth he'd set up was a pensioner, a lady in her sixties clutching a handbag. Valery helped her into the seat opposite his as she snarled at him. "Get out of my district, reactionary. This place isn't for your type and it never will be."\n\nValery simply smiled, drawing his secret weapon from his bag: a flask of tea, chilled and thoroughly stirred. "Reactionary? That's an interesting word to use, madam. I'd like to hear more about what you have to say about us - and if I'm not wrong, you stay on Petrov Street, don't you? Our representatives have never been to the area..."\n\nThe afternoon wore on, clouds scudding and fading across the patterned bands of the horizon. Valery danced with words, taking the lady on a tour of democratic ideals, PSD's manifesto and policymaking, and the agenda of Unionism. By the time the lady left, her head was full of strange new thoughts and something even stranger.

He moved the typewriter away from her still-twitching hands, taking care to remove the document and place it somewhere safe. There was valuable information in there, and the Boss would kill them both if she knew they'd wasted office supplies on a mere health concern.\n\nThe middle-aged woman did not resist as he tucked her head above her arms and his jacket on her back. Twenty uninterrupted hours of work: it was a wonder she wasn't in a coma. Well, it was the best he could do. Grabbing the document she'd been working on, Nikolai took his position and began to rewrite her own words. In truth, he already knew what she was working on.

Many of my own interactions were with factory managers who expected only the good things in life, not the responsibility to think about their implications.\n\nThis event, however, shows genuine promise for the District. I'm not sure whether to peg it to the laudable enthusiasm displayed by our surveyors, or to the warmth and compassion of the services we've offered under our The Government Works For All campaign. Either way, we believe the many agencies we've collaborated with deserve rich praise for their conduct during this campaign, and the near 60-percent increase in voting registrations rests in no small part on their many shoulders. Special thanks go to the Mitvol family, whose invaluable help in setting up our conversational tea-booths boosted our public image immensely.

Yes, he'd had his differences with Ivana, and yes, he'd come to blows with the Neo-Stolypinists in his ranks more times than he had fingers, but he'd kept the Party together even as so many had lost faith in his direction - if he stopped now, what would it mean for his life's work?\n\nThat was what Yahontov told Stalina, over a cup of hot tea at one of the less run-down cafes in this part of the Capital.

He was an entertaining spectacle to be sure, but for the rest of the young people in Syktyvkar, nothing more.\n\n"I just think that old fool needs some help is all.

Like a turtle, coaxed from its shell, her efforts had begun to yield fruit."

Vadim, usually a belligerent complainer, had noticed her change in attitude. He was calm, caring, and for once, her confidant. She had sat crying on his furniture, feeling better after a long talk.\n\nToday, as she approached the small cottage from a distance, a pit formed in her stomach. Vadim's flag was down, and his front door wide open. Two cars flanked each wall, and an armed militant leaned against one.\n\n"Whats going on?" She called out nervously\n\n"Displaying symbols of antidemocratic regimes is a crime," the militant retorted matter of factly ",what do you care?"\n\nNadia felt sick. If there was anyone in Syvkvytar who would resist such a measure, it would be Vadim. Though he could hardly make his way across the house sometimes, she held no doubt's that the tough old bastard would throw punches before taking down his flag voluntarily. The thought of Vadim, bloodied and languishing in jail, was almost too much to bear.\n\nShe set off in a panic, afraid of what she would find when she arrived."

 komi_authdem.10.t: "The Russian Identity"
 komi_authdem.10.d: "Stalina stared at the proposal before her, annoyed at its existence. The "Party Program Regarding Russian Identity" was dripping with danger. A political landmine had found its way to her desk, shoving a wrench in her proceeding with more important matters.\n\nOn the "Left" were those that supported autonomy. Russia, they rightly argued, was neither wholly European or Asian. Beneath her shattered banner lived many races; Buryats, Kazakhs, Tartars, Bashkirs. Each had unique customs, and a distinct identity. Trying to force them all into some unitary "Russian" identity, as their forebears had done, would only lead to resentment, and in the case of uniting Russia, popular resistance was an untenable prospect.\n\nOn the right were her comrades of sort, advocating the exact opposite. The task before Russia was grand; uniting a broken and disparate people against a teutonic invader. There would be no room for bickering in the unification struggle to come. The peoples of Russia had for centuries shared an identity, regardless of ethnicity, and could only restore themselves behind such a common name.\n\nUltimately, she did not feel strongly either way. This was a theoretical issue, something to be resolved when they had the luxury to do so. Much more pressing was rebuilding an economy, guarding against foreign threats, establishing control over newly acquired territories.\n\nYet still, she knew the inflammatory debate that had conspired to bring this proposal to her desk. It was the right wing that held most sway, and it was the right wing that kept her in power. In the interest of the Free Russian republic to come, many compromises would have to be made.\n\nBegrudgingly, she signed off on the right wing's proposal, authorising their blatant attempt to shape the Russian future in their image. To live in Russia was to be Russian, insignificant cultures be damned. Besides, what would matter most to the Baskirs and Tartars, bread and electricity? Or some pseudo-autonomy?"

Many centuries ago, Russia was much smaller than it was before the Great Patriotic War and the Russian Revolution. Siberia remained much of a wasteland, with few people living there. To expand the glory of the empire and spread Russian culture, the Tsars decided to settle more Russians east of the Urals. Nowadays, many Russians live in Siberia, and it is no different from Russia the further West you go. Expanding into Siberia made Russia big and strong. No one wants to be in a tiny country, do they?" The teacher paused and looked around the classroom, finding a boy with his hand up.\n\n"Teacher, what happened to the people in Siberia before we went there? Did they go somewhere else?" The boy questioned.\n\nThe teacher paused a moment, thinking. "Well, as I said, there were some people in Siberia before us. Not much changed for them though, they are still there, even in Siberia today. Back then though, many were ruled by terrible khans and suffered under raiders until Russia united them and brought them into Russia. With Russian culture, they learned to work together with each other and the new Russians." Content with her explanation, the teacher began to change the subject, then the boy spoke up once again.\n\n"Didn't they fight back though, like we fought the Germans?"\n\n"What, that's nothing like what happened at all," replied the teacher, obviously vexed by the boy. "Those are two entirely different situations. The raiders fought us of course, but they were murdering poor and innocent Russians. They had to be fought. Meanwhile, the Germans planned to exterminate all of Russia! The Germans were brutish devils while the Russians were pure saviors. Now, I don't want to hear about this any longer.

 komi_authdem.12.d: "Stalina sighed as she looked at the multitude of suggestions for her upcoming speech that had been thrown onto her desk. When she had thought of working to unite Russia, working to a better tomorrow for democracy, she hadn't imagined fools throwing themselves around at irrelevant issues instead of looking at the bigger picture. The biggest points of contention lately had not been of military strategy or anything that actually had any meaning. No, the bureaucrats were battling over the "Redemption of Russia". She needed to cement the state position, otherwise the Republic would still be babbling on about culture in the year 2000. Looking over suggestions for opening her speech gave her a headache. One leftist proposed the opening address to be towards "Those who reside within our controlled area of Russia". That contrasted with one man on the right who declared that she should address her speech to "The most loyal Russians of the Empire". It went on like that, paragraphs and pages on what some thought her first words should be. That didn't even brush upon the rest of the "critique" she was given. Some believed, on both sides, that how deep her voice was held the utmost importance. One concerned educator wrote in frantic pace about how speaking deep-voice would seem "Imperialistic". A miner who had learned their letters just to write to her pleaded in scrawled Russian that she acted "as a man".\n\nStalina, having wasted her night, tossed the pile to the waste basket. For this speech, she already knew the general ideas of what both sides of the party wanted. The Left, pandering to progressive causes and pluralism. The Right, lip service to a strong Russia. She weighed her options. She had little care for the actual issue, but the Right were presently a more powerful ally. It would anger the Leftists, sure, but, perhaps, that didn't quite matter all that much anyways. As long as Russia could be united under the Free Republic, it didn't matter who she stiffed. Decided, she finally began to write."

Many of the papers were the usual: status reports from the Moskowien border, reconstruction progress, and anti-partisan efforts. One document, however, captured Stalina's full attention.\n\nApparently, just across the Urals, another warlord had unified a large chunk of Western Siberia. The West Siberian People's Republic, led by one Lazar Kaganovich, had unified a quarter of Russia. Stalina would have dismissed them as any other Soviet warlord, except that these communists idolized Joseph Stalin, Stalina's father.\n\nAccording to Kaganovich, "Stalinism" consisted of an exceptionally hardline interpretation of communist ideology, with highly-centralized power and a focus on mass-industrialization. Stalina's father had died when she was young, but it seemed accurate to what she remembered of him.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter what specific strain of communist belief Kaganovich spouted, because at the end of the day they were still communists.

Boss Matovsky seldom came in before 11, the workers filed in at 9 sharp and between these times a peace descended upon the little cubicles of the Tax Registry Bureau. She would take her custom-made cup (a gift from a friend) and swish the dregs of her tea as she paced the office, taking in the sheer freshness of the morning streaming in through the office windows. There was something about solitude, Ludmila felt, that made the everyday magical - it was the redeeming perk of an otherwise uneventful job.\n\nShe wondered, as she often did, what the men and women of the office did to make them stay so late. Most offices closed at 5 and opened at 8, but she'd been specified to leave the offices open till 2am. If her parents hadn't passed on a few years back she'd have refused the job outright for its late hours. Even so, she was a light sleeper.\n\nAnd sometimes files passed, here and there, without even Ludmila noticing, and some of the dossiers she managed were thick one day and thin the next. It wasn't her job to notice, and so she made an effort not to. Better to keep to silence than to risk an intrusion - or her salary.\n\nThis morning, she thought, she would make herself her favourite tea-brew. Humming a light tune, she walked to the office doors and was taken quite by surprise by the thud of gunfire.\n\nAs the noise hammered her ears, she huddled by instinct against her desk and watched her world torn asunder by burly soldiers hefting crate upon crate of files - and protesting men - out the door. An officer, clambering up to her, yelled at her to go home - and four words, repeated over and over, such that they rang in her head with every step of the journey."

He had no idea how he'd escaped the initial payroll purges, but here he was, the last real tea-boy in whatever the Republic's leadership apparatus had become. And he had a job to do.\n\nHis fingers trembled as he struggled to write everything down: the two animated figures certainly didn't seem terribly concerned about their scribe, talking in a constant, uninterrupted flow of dialogue.

Noises and the echo of audiovisual equipment could be heard through noon, as residents hid in their beds and snapped obscenities at the menace. For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world.

The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked "APPROVED". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window.

How had she worked with them for so long without tiring of the effort?\n\nPresently they were speaking regarding the latest Political Reservation measures, measures she'd put in place to ensure the safety of the State.

Well, this latest bill would shut up the yapping once and for all. Hiding her growing irritance she waved for the Speaker to admit her name to the list.\n\nSavouring the looks on the legislators' faces as she did so, Stalina spoke in what seemed almost like glee: "Under the auspices of the Executive Directive Act, I declare the Political Reservation Measures under discussion today a matter of National Security. Discussion of this topic is hereby curtailed; now, if I could invite the audience to examine page 63 of our latest Economic Budget..."\n\nWatching the sheepdogs storm out of the Chamber, Stalina felt something churn in her stomach.

She hadn't gone a month without some kind of sparring between his allies in the military and her own faction of the PSD, especially since the man was, by all accounts, incorruptible as he was stubborn. And who could forget the devil from her own party, the Loyal Oppositionist, Mizayov? She'd been one of the most terrifying debaters in the Party before Stalina had managed to integrate their ideals into a united force, in the early days - even now she was facing dogged resistance in the Legislative Branch for a controversial stance on the latest welfare bills, and coming out all the stronger for it.\n\nAs they stared in mutual confusion at the empty room, Stalina cleared her throat and rose to speak.

 komi_despotism.13.d: "Stalina's fingers trembled as she wrote. How best to describe what she was doing? Never in her career had she dreamed of succumbing to her worst impulses - and yet the nightmare of paranoia and perpetual control seemed to unfold as she wrote it into being, horrifying and clear as day.\n\nA light breeze blew through the study, gently flickering the candle she was using for light. Stalina kneaded her eyes, clutched at a useless coffee mug, and gazed at the dense script. Something in her felt deeply unbalanced, like a child playing on an endless swing whose hinges grew ever looser. Any moment she would fall off, and the game would be lost, and the long work would be lost with it. No, this was not the time for some idle nonsense! Only an objective examination of the facts would do. Rousing within herself the old strength she relied on, she stared at the current Bill.\n\nThe present draft would pass muster as it stood, she was sure. Increases in public security budgets and extraordinary provisions for law enforcement, investigations into public journalism outlets with suspicious sources, a crackdown on radical unionism: that was surely uncontroversial. And yet she wondered if she should make it lighter - perhaps only an investigation of formal socialist parties instead of a blanket attack on the unions? Yes, it seemed better to adopt a gentle touch.\n\nAnd yet it seemed woefully incomplete, almost vulnerable, in the space of an eye's blink. No, better to be harsh and stable than to regret leniency! Yes, a forced destruction of independent outlets here - and here - surely that would bring the Republic's radicals to its knees. Surely this would be enough.\n\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet...Stalina's head whirled, a maelstrom of thought. It was far too much, it was never enough. How had it ever come to this? And was a better choice even possible?"

 komi_despotism.14.d: "Stalina watched the sun set over her little corner of the Republic. The streets glowed, a neon shimmer washing over the shopfronts. Couples paced, giggling as they did so, down the broadwalks of the city centre, and to their flanks the city came to cautious life. Here and there a busker played their repertoire to all who would listen, drawing in curious crowds and the occasional tourist. If there were signs of protest, they were certainly well hidden (although the recent Public Security Act was very comprehensive, it was not supernatural).\n\nShe felt tired, hollowed out, even. The preceding months had taken their toll on her sleep schedule, and she'd been through so many arguments with her closest staff that she sometimes felt ashamed to greet them in the morning. It felt like a vast abyss separated her from the old Stalina, the committed Democrat, the speech-writer and rabble-rouser. Would her past self even like the person she had become?\n\nStalina sighed. Perhaps this was how her father had felt in the last years of his life. Withdrawn and burnt out by the endless contention for power - it was no wonder the old Steel had rusted and broken, and with what to show for it? A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day. For now, what she had built would suffice. She reached to the telephone to call Kosygin. Even if the Republic disdained her, her friends - and her brandy - would not."

Usually this took the form of mild snarls and accusations of incompetence, which was comparatively mild for the Republic's politics. It was of little consequence to the advisors, and after she calmed down she was usually more amenable to discussion, even if she remained reluctant to change her views on anything. Anger was common, and easy to deal with.\n\nThis preternatural calm, however, was not. Stalina looked at the senior staff of the Economic Bureau, calm, unsmiling and totally implacable. "No, I will not. That is the end of the matter. I will not reconsider the signing of the Sovereignty Act under any circumstances." She flipped open a dossier, looking through its contents as if her staff were simply not there.\n\nOne of the advisors, a mid-level bureaucrat, made the mistake of speaking his thoughts. "President Stalina, with all due respect, the Act will cripple our economic will and devour our private industry. I have been on the phone with worried corporate clients all week."\n\nInstantly her gaze, as scorching as the sun and far less measured in its touch, was upon him. "With all due respect, I care not a whit for you or the corporate suits. My job and my heart lie with this country, and if we are to sell its treasure to those who cannot be trusted with it we may as well disband the Army and lower our banners tomorrow."\n\nShe turned to her papers with a rare vehemence. "You are forgiven the little transgression of your ignorance. Speak against me again and I will ensure even that privilege is stripped from you. Now leave.""

The DSNP have formally promised to continue the Republic's transition to socialism, however most pundits expect the DSNP to continue to implement social democratic policies.

Beside him the squad rustled in its frantic activity: water canteens needed filling, loaded bags checking, rifles inspecting. There were barely enough hands on deck to accomplish it all.\n\nAs the officer lumbered away, Kirov whispered, "Shitbag." What an insufferable son of a whore! And scheduling this goddamn idiotic march on a Friday fucking evening, of all things! Did the Colonel have his brain installed where the arsehole was meant to be?\n\nGod, it was intolerable - and the only reason why he put up with it all was because the Republican Army was still the finest pension-fund in all of the Republic. Kirov was a man of faith - he had faith only in what men could bring him, that was. And having looked through the pension plans, he knew exactly what the next few decades would bring him, assuming he lived through it all.\n\nWell, time to stop speculating on the future: the present, and his squad, awaited him. He moved towards his squad. "Are you lot ready to go? Get your thumbs out of your asses, gentlemen. It's time to start hauling ass, and if you lot have taught me anything it's that men without brains can get very, very far in life. It's time to start putting that theory to practice."\n\nA chuckle escaped the squad, and Kirov's gaze shot to its source. Glaring at the conscript, Kirov let the coldness of the evening into his voice. "Did you think that was funny, Private? Don't give me an answer. You'll have time to think about it on guard duty tomorrow. Double shifts." He turned to the rest of the squad. "Get ready to move. One mike.

 komi_dem_generic.2.d: "It was, like every other evening at the Foreign Strategy Office, both way too long and ridiculously short for their work. Another exercise was planned the following week, and the Commanding Officer had put everyone on standby for emergency planning duty. Officer Nabatov had been on emergency duty the last twenty-four hours in a row, and the map wasn't just swimming in front of him - it was doing victory laps in his eyes.\n\nShaking his head, he took another swing of the jealously-hoarded coffee ration and looked again at his prooftexts. He had to make the maps fit together, damnit, and in their proper order - there had to be some applicability of the Manual of Foreign Operational Doctrine here. What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed. How on earth could he make this offensive work in the five hours he had left?\n\nHe barely noticed the Commanding Officer approach, but he did smell the pungent cigarette fumes on his breath. "Trouble planning this? Here, try this reference - American work, British defense. Good for the terrain, armor strength parity might need a little rework though." And the CO was gone as Nabatov's eyes widened behind him.\n\nYes, he thought as he flicked through the manual. This would work. This would work! His legs turning to jelly from the exultance and stress, Nabatov scribbled a few hasty notes and rose to find the Strategic Briefing Notes. And then, for the first time in two days, he could sleep."

The thud of a binder punctuated the last words, and Strelkov flinched. At least the Commander hadn't aimed for his head this time. "If the Council truly believes that this newfangled strategy is what is best, I think it best that we safeguard the real power far away from them until they are disabused of the notion."\n\nStrelkov nodded helplessly. "Commander Grigorenko! Please, this is not a usurpation or anything of the sort. We are simply attempting to better strategy now that our Air Force is in working condition. After all, we in the Republic cannot afford casualties the same way large countries can - "\n\nAnother binder-thud, this one louder than the first. "You are delusional if you think that the air-land strategy will safeguard our losses! Strelkov, I have been working for close to a decade in the Military, and our entire operational doctrine has been configured to work with combined armor-infantry operations. The Air Force will only complicate this state of affairs by stealing resources and money from us."\n\nStrelkov kneaded his temples. "Commander, there is to be no stealing - we will allocate funds as we deem fit for the health of the Republic. Moreover, we are aware that the transition to air-land battle will take quite awhile, which is why we need you on board. Who else could train with us?"\n\nGrigorenko simply shook his head.

It had been sudden, too - one minute there was a reasonable discussion regarding prioritization of funding to be given to the Military Research Department, the next a full-on fistfight had been in progress, with men in middle age on both sides struggling to either restrain or deck their peers.\n\nKorolkov sighed. Another day in the Ministry of Defense and its assembled glories. Well, glories was a strong term, but he lacked another word for it.\n\nAt least this paperwork would be of use to the Republic - a paper drafted by one of his staffers on the movement of hybridized troops in the last days of the West Russian War, and a note on how to make it applicable to the Republic's current situation. Poring through its conclusions, Korolkov nodded, making notes in the margins. There was plenty of work to be done to bring the military up to parity with its contemporaries, and this would definitely help.\n\nA stubble-headed member of the General Staff approached him, and Korolkov got up to show the formalities. "Stand down. I'm looking for a paperback, something to fill the gap on someone's chair. Hmm, have you seen any spare binders? Preferably something slim? Ah, this will do," and the paperwork was snatched from Korolkov's desk.\n\nThe General Staff member retreated, and Korolkov kneaded his temples in frustration. This was his third day of promotion, and already he missed nothing more than the lowly status of his previous position. The Republic, he was certain, was doomed regardless; but at least he had been blind to it beforehand."

 komi_dem_generic.5.d: "Yefimova's father had whispered dreams to her when she was a child: dreams of a shining fleet of ships, flying the Red Ensign in unison. Each ship, he had told her, was far bigger than the fishing junk they shared: they had guns, ammunition stores, quarters for dozens of people on each ship, and the burnished steel shone like gold in the sun's rays, like some forgotten treasure brought to light.\n\nOf course, that had been a long time ago, he had whispered, and now the Republic they were in was landlocked, and the dream, for now, was dead. But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do. A vision, after all, was worthless if not fulfilled.\n\nShe wished her father could see her now, standing upon the deck of the Republic's latest vessel. He'd always been foolish, and perhaps a little too attached to the drink at the end, but he'd never wavered, and her dreams were his dreams, too.\n\nAnd watching the flag fly above a silver-sheened ocean, gulls flying overhead as the engine whirred, Yefimova felt something in her heart glow. Her father, wherever he was, could rest now. His dream was here, in the flesh, and she was living it for him."

Perhaps it was acceptable in Zlatoust, where standards were as low as the Altai Basin's dunes, but not here. He lowered the gun and began to pore over the blueprints scattered around him in a half-blossom.\n\nPerhaps it had been the material, or perhaps there was a structural cause in sight. The latter would explain why the soldiers on the Testing Squad had complained so bitterly about the loading and unloading drills. Something about the barrel, then - but their reports had focused on the firing-pin mechanism itself, so it couldn't possibly be that. Maybe in the way the barrel interacted with the firing pin? Yes, perhaps the explosion of the shot had cracked something within.\n\nA passing soldier yelled, "Korenev! Hard at work? It's almost lunch!" Koronev, barely looking up, greeted him and told him, in no uncertain terms, to go away. The soldier giggled as he left: it was adorable, the way Korenev was so immersed in his work he was blind to everything else. Absolutely adorable.\n\nKorenev's mind was far away, however: the rifle, as did all the equipment he'd been given, preoccupied him. Some solution needed to be found in the meantime. The barrel problem would probably need a full rework of the design, perhaps even a back to basics test. But the main problem, as he saw it, was the drooping. Perhaps - yes - that would have to do.\n\nKorenev scribbled: PUT SOME EXTRA STOCK ON THE RIFLE AND TELL THEM TO AIM HIGHER. Satisfied, he nodded and went on to the next rifle."

The Budget simply didn't have enough room for the additions of tank units to the Regiments of the existing armor corps. It would be necessary to reconsolidate their existing assets into a single unit, and retrain them day and night until they could perform the roles they'd missed.\n\nSo the People's Hussar Division, as it was known (no one could remember the actual number and reference), was formed, and the farmers and their sons and daughters watched the tanks move row on row into distant fields, towards the base where they were to be christened in a new name and mould.\n\nThere were failures, as there always were: a few of the new models, fresh from the factory, had broken down in a muddy field, and no one was yet sure if it was equipment failure or a planning error that had brought them down. The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit. There was a sense of general anticipation - this one, it was believed, would go far, and it would take the Republic with it."

His rusty old wristwatch had been a gift from Dad, but there was no sign of his father's precision now as he watched the dusty road. It had been, if this little contraption was accurate, almost half an hour since the scheduled delivery to the Military Academy. How the hell was he supposed to get there on time?\n\n"Yes, far indeed. I've been waiting forty-five minutes myself." There was a twinkle in the other man's eye. Sokalov sized him up, suspicious as a miner's son in a poor district could be of someone who looked suspiciously bourgeois. Dressed in relatively well-tailored clothing, with a little cap to stave off the wind - this man looked nothing like what he'd been told to encounter. "I don't believe we've met. I'm Semyon. You?"\n\nSokalov glared at the hand, then relented and shook. "I'm Sokalov. South of Syktyvkar. You with the Academy?" Semyon - if that was his real name - nodded, his smile firm on his face. "Well then, I suppose we'll get acquainted eventually. What's your designated specialisation?" The man rustled about in his breastpocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. "Ah, I'm assigned to Artillery and Fire Control. You're Infantry Standards, I take it? I know they're taking a lot of them these days, and you seem the type."\n\nSokalov nodded, chuckling a little. "Can't believe they sent me to Vyatka after sending me into the roughbodies - think the Army wants to kill me, between the both of us." Semyon chuckled back, and the air between them grew easy. "Why did you sign up? This course ain't gonna be easy for none of us."\n\nThe man seemed almost shy. "The same reason as you. I love my country." He waved to the fields around them, boundless as the sky itself. "And I want to keep it free." Sokalov nodded. The two were very different, but they were going to get along just fine."

WELCOME, BROTHERS FROM RUSSIA is plastered virtually everywhere in the airport, and the questions seem to be fired in volleys for maximal damage. It's all the bodyguards can do to keep him safe from the chaos.\n\nIt gets a little better when the Ambassador is ushered to the Finnish Government's official headquarters. There the mob of intense reporters is locked out, and the only man in a suit the Ambassador must face is the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, what he lacks in numbers he more than makes up for in intensity: there seems no escaping from his intense, silent gaze.\n\nAt least the conversation starts cordial. The Ambassador makes polite small talk, drawing from the little he knows of the Finnish within his own country: he talks of music, culture, shared brotherhood. The Prime Minister replies in kind, but there is something in his eyes that reminds the Ambassador of a butcher checking his latest cut for its weight and value. Something transactional, something shallow.\n\nThen the Prime Minister looks him in the eye and asks: What is the status of the occupied territory of Karelia? The room seems to drop a hundred degrees in minutes. What answer could there possibly be?\n\nAs the Ambassador squirms in his seat, a fish fresh out of water, the Prime Minister guffaws and bear-hugs him. Welcome to Finland, he says.

The WRFR has vast fields of oil, a strong timber industry, and increasingly developed light and heavy industrial sectors, such as steel and chemicals. In addition, given river and rail development, the WRFR also has economic ties to other parts of Russia, Central Asia, and regions further east. However, this nascent economy needs a boost in order to be all that it can be. Should we offer direct financial aid, investment subsidies, and perhaps R&D funding to the WRFR? It could yield economic and political benefits down the line, even if the cost up-front strikes some as unreasonable."

 komi_dem_generic.39.d: "An interesting offer has recently come to the State Department from the embassy of the [KOM.GetName]. The country controls a series of ports along the White Sea, in the far north of Russia, near Finland and the Baltic region. While the sea is fairly quiet these days, there is a substantial amount of military infrastructure left over from when ports like Arkhangelsk were controlled by the West Russian Revolutionary Front. The WRFR is offering to give us basing rights at these ports, in exchange for a yearly increase to their aid funding of approximately 550 million dollars. While this sum may seem eye-popping at first, it's a rounding error for a budget as big as the USA's, and in exchange, the US Navy would have a toehold deep in the heart of Russia, within striking distance of numerous strategic targets. What should we do?"

The White House has promised that Congress's support for this new line item is guaranteed, and that as long as our port facilities are ready, the US Navy will be able to establish a presence in our waters. For us, this is a significant diplomatic coup. We get an American military presence for defense, and a substantial amount of funding that can be put to good use. Already, officials at our foreign ministry are toasting to a job well done."

While the American government has noted that our offer of basing rights on the White Sea had its benefits, and that they desired continually positive diplomatic relations, the price tag was ultimately too high for them to justify. Negotiations over the agreement broke down, and unfortunately, they broke down quite publicly. Word of the failure has already made its way to the press, and some commentators are calling for the foreign minister to resign over the matter. With the diplomatic row and the loss of a potential financial lifeline, this has clearly been a major blow to our government's standing."

 komi_dem_generic.42.d: "Campaigning has begun, and the DSNP has started in earnest. The Democratic Socialist People's Party, supporting democratic socialism in the republic, have started to spread their message of equality and worker's rights. This has gained the support of the poor and the workers of Russia, who now see the DSNP as a party for the poor. It seems the DSNP will have a lot of support from the laborers and the working class.\n\nThe Democratic Socialist's promises for equality in the republic have also gained the support of many laborers and farmers alike, unhappy with their conditions and especially with the landowners that have been gaining power ever since the collapse of authority in the warlord era. However, the DSNP's past scandals still hurts the party to this day, and it may be an uphill battle to win the election."

 komi_dem_generic.43.d: "The Gorky factory hall was oddly quiet as Nikolai Voznesensky stood facing the countless factory workers, tired from hours of hard labor. They didn't seem interested in him, more glad to have a break than anything. Voznesensky knew he would have to make a good speech to get these workers on his side.\n\n"Laborers of Gorky, I come here with promises. Promises of workers rights, healthcare, higher wages, safety regulations, more pay and fewer hours. You have worked tirelessly for Russia. Whether you produce tanks or toys, you are the ones who will be building a better Russia. Not the politicians, not the economists, but you, the worker. Producing weapons or civilian goods, you make a better Russia for us all, one step at a time."\n\nThe workers had begun to perk up, it seemed like they were becoming more interested in what Voznesensky had to say. "For all you have done, I thank you. But I wouldn't be doing anything if I was just congratulating you or giving out promises, would I? I assure you, in my presidency, the workers will be my top priority. Your hard work will no longer be unrewarded! For what you do for this country, you will be duly compensated. I promise all of you, no worker of this republic will ever be ignored again!"\n\nAs he finished the speech, Voznesensky looked into the eyes of everyone in the room. Eyes of hope, pain, and a desire for a better life. He could not let these people down."

Containing the ideals for a democratic socialist state, the DSNP wants to reach as much of the masses as possible to win the election.\n\nThe pamphlets include writings from prominent DSNP members and the party's platform. As such, the pamphlet mentions the DSNP's plan to increase workers' rights in great detail. Plans of workplace democracy, empowering unions, and increased pay have been promised to all the workers of the republic. The pamphlet also goes on to say how the DSNP plans to transition the republic into a socialist democracy and a socialized economy, creating a republic of equality. Still, many doubt the DSNP, if elected, could successfully implement any of their reforms."

 komi_dem_generic.45.t: "PSD Campaigns"
 komi_dem_generic.45.d: "The campaigning parties continue to spread their platforms across Russia, and the PSD is no different. From the large cities to the small villages, Sovereign Democratic Party presence can be seen almost everywhere. A platform for a strong, sovereign Russia, the PSD hopes to appeal to everyone, the factory workers, the farmers, and the business owners. The Sovereign Democratic Party hopes anyone who cares for their motherland will vote for them in the coming elections.\n\nThe PSD, hoping to steal votes from other parties as well, are also promising social democratic and capitalist policies. Social policies as well as free-market economics are becoming a main point of the Sovereign Democratic Party. One thing is for sure, the PSD should not be underestimated."

 komi_dem_generic.46.t: "The PSD Platform"
 komi_dem_generic.46.d: "More pamphlets are circulating across the country from the parties. The PSD's includes stories from everyday Russians both young and old as well as the party's platform. Containing the ideals for a strong and independent Russia that stands above its enemies, the pamphlet has many promises for the future, hoping to gain the support of every Russian.\n\nAs written in the pamphlet, the Sovereign Democratic Party has promised a social-democratic republic, one that does not ignore the poor and in need, yet bashes the DSNP for its radical ideas. The pamphlet also advertises anti-extremism and anti-radicalism, denouncing both fascism and communism. The PSD has also promised more liberal social policies, advocating for equality and liberty. Most important to the PSD however, is the reclamation of Russia. In their platform, the PSD has promised to focus efforts on reunifying the motherland, no matter the cost. With this, the republic under the PSD can expect an increase in the size of the military and preparations for a war economy.\n\nIt's certain the PSD has much support, but will a platform of war and reclamation work with everyone?"
 komi_dem_generic.46.a: "And I thought they were authoritarian!"

 komi_dem_generic.47.t: "Surrounding Threats"
 komi_dem_generic.47.d: "It was a brisk, cool morning in the republic's capital. Stalina, standing above a crowd of onlookers, prepared to make the first speech of her campaign.\n\n"Brothers and sisters of Russia, our motherland is in danger. Our young republic is surrounded by those who wish to destroy it, just as it was ten years before. We cannot make the same mistakes! We must all be stronger. The failure that led to the destruction of the revolutionary front by Germany must not end our republic as well. And to the east are even greater threats. Rival governments that claim they are the true government of Russia. Warlords who wish to conquer and pillage our homes and destroy our democracy. We must defend our families, our Russia!"\n\nThe crowd seemed to be growing larger now, so Stalina began to speak louder. "A PSD victory means a Russia that can defend itself from aggression, and a Russia that can take the upper hand. If we want to defeat those who threaten us, we must strike first. Russia needs a large to defend herself. If we appear weak, our enemies will strike us down. Vote PSD, and save Russia!""

Russia needs all of your help. Your intelligence, creativity, and determination will decide the future of your country. The Union of Young Reformers is working towards a developed and modern Russia. I promise that together, we can lead Russia into a new age. The SMR will fund your projects, your dreams, and your jobs. You will be the ones transforming Russia, helping its economy, its sciences, and its people. A smart, modern Russia can be built out of nothing. What will you do to help Russia? What will you do to make your dreams come true?"\n\nThe incredible crowd, encompassing most of the university, went wild with excitement. They were Russia's future. Why would the SMR let them down?"

Including the dreams and ideas of a modern, developed Russia, the pamphlet hopes to attract voters who wish for a better life escaping from poverty and living a modern lifestyle. In the pamphlet, the SMR promises to totally transform Russia during its term.\n\nResearch funding is also a major stance taken by the party, hoping new technologies will modernize the country. This has also begun to gain the interest of everyday Russians, intrigued by new technologies that could make their lives easier.\n\nThe Union of Young Reformers also includes ideas from other parties, including social equality and workers benefits. The SMR hopes to create a full market economy and bring prosperity to all Russians. Connections can be easily made to the American system.

Addressing us as a fellow free nation, the communique praises both the achievements of our country and those of the OFN. President [KOM.GetLeader] expresses both her wish to obtain affiliate status in the OFN and foster closer ties between our nations, and her willingness to open her markets to us. She also makes sure to remind us of our common struggle against Japan and the Reich. Reading between the lines, she hopes to obtain additional military and financial support. Support that the cost of which, if it'll secure us an allied Russia, will be a small price to pay."

komi_friendship.1.d: "코미 공화국 국회는 타협을 가장한 음모와 속임수, 얄팍한 위협의 장이다. 비록 그것이 공화국의 잘 기능하는 심장일지라도, 그것의 안은 서로 다른 그림자 속 플라그들의 충돌로 가득 차 있었다. 열성적인 좌파와 포퓰리즘적인 우파 사이에 집권중인 중도파 연합이 있었다. DSNP, SMR, PSD 세 당만이 국회에서 진정한 민주주의 정당이었다. 그들의 정책은 그 이상 다를 수가 없었지만, 그들은 함께 앉아 있었고 그들 모두는 극단주의의 늑대들이 어둠 속에서 그들의 자리를 탐욕스럽게 바라보고 있는 것을 혐오했다.\n\nSMR과 PSD 의석 사이의 경계에는 두 명의 국회의원이 앉아, 원내에 새로 상정되는 법안들을 평소보다 조금 더 경계하는 모습을 보였다. SMR에서 키가 크지만 얌전해 보이는, 보이는 것 보다 나이들었을 한 여성이 있었다. PSD에서 나온 다부지고 자신 넘치는 건장한 청년이 그녀 옆에 앉았다. 그들은 둘 다 토론이 일어나는 것에 대해 비슷한 생각을 하며 용납할 수 없는 것이 있지는 않은지 열심히 듣고있었다. 그들이 극단주의자들을 증오했던 만큼, 그들은 공화국을 사랑했고, 공화국의 민주주의를 사랑했다.\n\n열성당의 한 회원이 의회를 반쯤 방해하는 동요되고 떠들썩한 고함을 지른 후, 두 사람은 서로를 주시했다. "그와 같은 사람들은 우리의 민주주의를 파괴할 것입니다", 두 사람 다 눈빛으로 서로 표정을 교환하며 말했다. 그들은 서로 고개를 끄덕이며 자기 소개를 했다..."

But not Elena. Despite her being rather furious, she stood her ground with very few other SMR members, those who would hopefully make their voices heard.\n\n"That disgusting, apathetic, traitorous pig! Is Voznesensky abandoning the party that won the last election with him for those dirtbag marxist-leninist zealots?"\n\nYegveny sighed, understanding her concern. "I get that, I really do. I'm sure he would've done the same to us if we were in the SMR's place, but our caucus has bigger things to focus on right now. Almost the entire SMR delegation walking out shows the others that we do not stand in solidarity with each other, and it makes us look weak."\n\nElena, now looking physically furious, began to full-on debate Yevgeny. "How could you even support anything that conniving despot says? He would throw the entire caucus under the bus to drink champagne with his party and celebrate victory while working with the very forces which want to destroy us! Let me guess, your "Woman of Steel" said it wasn't a big deal. That she would work with whatever the DSNP wants to keep her own party in the majority. We're supposed to stay true to our democratic principles!"\n\nThe rest of the Assembly looked on in intrigue, and Elena soon became part of the procession who left the building. Yevgeny sat there, somewhat upset and embarrassed, but silently believed that she would come to her senses. She, and the rest of the SMR, had to. For if they didn't, our democracy would die."

Reconciliations between parties and a strategy for election day were planned to happen tomorrow. Among other initiatives to strengthen the power of the Center came Elena and Yevgeny, as they were a few months ago, analyzing key issues together. Combined in one of the Assembly building's offices, they gathered other like-minded members of the Center and gathered all evidence, notes, and observations they have about the political situation in Komi.\n\n"The left is divided between "reformist" and "orthodox" lines, with yet another division in their orthodox caucus." Elena presented.\n\n"Furthermore, the right is extremely ideologically fragmented as well. Fascists, Eurasianists, Shafarevichites, and Monarchists do not mix well." Yevgeny added. "We're convinced that the Center has the greatest chance for unity and the greatest chance to appeal to the common voter, despite the obstacles we may face."\n\n"Like what? What's an obstacle which could possibly be holding us back?" Elena eyed Yevgeny, and the two nodded at each other. They were ready for this. They've seen and known it since day one.

He did not want to remember the documents he burned in his house today with the very same matches he used to light his cigarette. "Member of the Passionariyy Society. Not anymore, but God forbid they found out. They'd sweep the entire PSD under the rug as despots and fascist sympathizers in disguise." Yegveny thought to himself deeply, looking at the stars forming in the night sky.\n\n"Hey, Yevgeny!" He panicked, dropping his cigarette and matchbox into the street below, and turning around to see Elena. "I came here to drop off some papers to you. You don't look so well though. Should I come back later, or..?"\n\nThe two of them talked for what seemed like hours, despite being only a few short minutes. "Elena, I have to come clean. I was a card-carrying member of them once. The Passionariyy. To think I only spent some years off the street beating our political opponents... I don't want to be reminded of it, and I'm terrified of what they'd do to me if they found out."\n\nElena sighed, and sat down on his desk, with her arm extended to move his face to look at her. "Yevgeny, it's okay. I don't care what you did back then. You're a good person now, and you're going to help us put a nail in their coffin for good. I know it."\n\nHe smiled, exhaled camly, and thanked her. He was safe, despite his past, and so was his beloved Republic."

komi_friendship.8.d: "After much debate in another closed meeting of the Assembly, many agreed that Stalina was the best shot at curbing radical leftist influence. A stalwart anti-extremist, more so than any other democratic leader at the moment, the government passed a motion of support in favor of her to enact some of her plans in order to protect the Center from the Left. While the entirety of the PSD is overjoyed right now, the largest majority of NO votes came from the SMR. Elena was the only member of the SMR who abstained, and wasn't too excited about the following resolution.\n\n"Hey, Elena. The vote's got you down, no?" Yegveny was standing over her seat, coming over from the delegation of PSD members.\n\n"I don't want to talk about it right now. I never thought we would get behind her policies like that, even if it's for the good of the Republic..."\n\nYevgeny sat down beside her, and much like how she confided in him, he began to confide in her. "I would've done the exact same you were doing right now if Kosygin was Stalina. I know you're reluctant to vote for someone you disagree with. She may be the Woman of Steel, and she may not be the most liberal, but we have to remember that we're in this together. You won't be a deviant for bending your values a bit, especially if it's only for now. The PSD and DSNP will all go together to the polls, and we don't want the SMR to have doubts. Especially not me."\n\nWith a sigh, she nodded. "I'll consider supporting her agenda in the future. I suppose I owe you for this one, friend.""

Are you really willing to put your own partisan politics over the sanctity of our democratic process and protection of it from subverters?" In a heated assembly meeting, many members of the PSD, including a very vocal Yegveny, are furious about the recent direction the government has taken. To them, Stalina was a woman of steel, with a plan of iron and a will of titanium. Now, she and her party were embarrassed and sidelined. Voznesensky's harsh dismissal of her plan has caused more harm than good, it seems.\n\nThe PSD is fracturing the democratic Center. While all members of the PSD seemed to agree with Yevgeny's talking points, other democratic members of the assembly simply watched in shock. Jeers from the right and left energized their own platforms; further lowering the morale of the Center. When all hope seemed to be lost, a single voice was raised in the assembly.\n\n"Yevgeny, you promised to help us... what are you going to do now? We said we would defend democracy together!" Elena, almost on the verge of a breakdown, stood up valiantly and finally had the courage to confront her friendly rival on the Assembly floor.\n\nAfter silence and a sigh, he finally spoke. "I'm going to accept the results of the election, regardless. I have no faith in a system that sidelines their own allies for meaningless favors." With his statement, the Center remained quiet. The roar of celebration from the other sides, however..."

The birds outside the capital were flying freely, sweeping low through the streets and high into the clouds; even amidst the rare crack of gunfire. Even with the intensity of Komi's political situation ramping up, both of the assembly members remained calm and collected. There would be a future for the people of Komi which wasn't one which would bend too far to either side.\n\n"So..." She began. "How does it feel to be headed into this election as one, partner?"\n\nYevgeny looked to his side, eyeing the smiling Elena next to him. "Partner? I'm more partial to the use of colleague, but go off, I suppose."\n\nThe two share a brief laugh, before continuing to walk to their homes. "Not everyone will be happy when it comes time to cast our ballots, that's for sure. But, at the same time, I'm okay with it. And hopefully you are too." Elena nodded.\n\n"You know, I never understood Stalina's fascination with paternalism. Could you explain it again?" Once again, the two of them were locked in a fierce, but friendly debate, one that would continue until they reached their homes. Regardless, when they parted ways, they were both accepting of the overall motions that the political system was going through. As uncoordinated and bickering as the Center may be, they shall hold fast once again."

Elena and Yevgeny both gave two short speeches in support of their candidates, hoping to garner up some last minute support for both.\n\n"...I know Alexei personally. Deputy Kosygin would be a safe, sane choice for a healthy democratic Komi, and perhaps with time, Russia as a whole. In a region and world so corrupted by undemocratic tyrants, the policies of Deputy Kosygin would be the light shining against the darkness."\n\n"...I speak for many of us when I say that Stalina is a bulwark. She will protect your rights, your freedoms, and this country from radicals. No other candidate is as crucial to ensuring a safe and just democratic process as she is. I promise she will never let you, nor the people of Komi, down!"\n\nBoth finished their speeches to respective cheers and boos.

Neither the clean record and charm of Kosygin or the firebrand integrity of Stalina would defend the Center. She thought of Voznesensky as a closet communist. He thought of him as a misguided idealogue.\n\n"Now what?" Elena sighed, rubbing her temples and closing her eyes. "Neither of us want to stand up for that racist bastard, but do we have another choice?"\n\n"I didn't come this far over a year to quit now. You don't care about how we got here, and neither do I. But this is the hand we've been dealt. There's too much at stake to not play it."\n\n"I... Suppose you're right. It's just disappointing to have it come down to this."\n\nThe two walked briskly in silence. Yevgeny's hands were sternly clasped in his pockets, gripping an anger that wasn't entirely there.

Although Voznesensky was rightly defeated on the ballot to the elatement of both assembly members, Kosygin's nomination deeply upset many in the PSD. Yevgeny was no different. Although he had pledged to defend democracy, was this really who he had to fight for? Was there no true other choice?\n\n"I know you're disappointed, Yevgeny. I can only imagine what you feel." Elena tried to console her colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on him. Much like the Woman of Steel herself, Yegveny was seemingly dead-set on his iron-willed ideals.\n\nThat is, until he stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep inhale, he released the tension in his body, and turned to face Elena. "It's no big deal. I know we were upset during the nomination, but I want to talk to some of them. Tell them that there's still hope. We may not be the happiest, but we're willing to hold on much the same. Even with Kosygin."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, he crosses the busy street.

Although she had pledged to defend democracy, was this really who she had to fight for? Was there no true other choice?\n\n"As upsetting as it may be, Stalina is the only shot we have at keeping the entire system alive; including the existence of your party." Yevgeny tried to console his colleague and friend, yet it seemed to have little effect on her. Idealistic to the end, much like Kosygin himself. She was seemingly unmoving and uncompromising in her direction.\n\nThat is, until she stopped briskly on a street corner. With a deep exhale, she released the tension in her body, and turned to face Yevgeny. "No matter, I suppose. Many in our delegation are... very clearly disappointed, but there's nothing they won't do to bring freedoms to the people of Komi. Including supporting Stalina."\n\nWith a wave goodbye, she crosses the busy street. Yevgeny, with a large grin appearing on his face, laughs happily to himself. Democracy is unbreakable, it seems."

Despite all of this, Elena and Yegveny sat down one last time together as allies. For all of their hard work, the last thing they wanted to do before it all went down was head for a drink.\n\n"Ready?"\n\n"Ready. Za zdorovye!" With the clink of two glasses, both assembly members take the first few sips of their drinks. Yevgeny coughs a bit, but with a cheerful expression. Elena simply sits calmly and downs her liquor, the bitterness trapping her tongue. Vodka, above all else, was more than just cheap entertainment and a staple of the Anarchic diet. It was a truth-sealer. "I didn't think we'd get this far without being shot, honestly."\n\n"Oh, nonsense! If you keep thinking like that, Elena, I'd be surprised if you don't drop dead from this vodka." Holding in their laughter, the two finally break and chuckle childishly. Perhaps in the past year, they would never expose this laid-back attitude to one another. Political enemies. PSD dog. SMR freeloader. All of that distrust and hatred disappeared with a few sips.\n\nAfter sitting silently for a while and drinking a bit more, Yevgeny pushes his drink to the side and faces his friend. "Hey, Elena? Promise me something over one more drink, eh?"\n\n"What's the matter? About to tell me your life story?"\n\n"Nah, this is way better. You and me, no matter what happens tomorrow... I want us to stick together. We came this far to protect our democracy. I don't want to jeer at your side of the aisle again."\n\nAlthough originally taken off guard, she nods intently and offers her hand. "Shake on it. For life." With the firm hold of their hands, they would form a spiritual bond which, perhaps, could survive long enough to see their future come to fruition. A future for all of us."

No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the Center has held strong. Democracy has survived our fragile system, and has emerged stronger than ever before. The thought that this was a time for celebration was an understatement, Komi is essentially able to breathe once again.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sit on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. "Just like the day before, huh?" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n"Your face isn't as red. It's a miracle you woke up today." Elena retorts. The two share one genuine, hearty laugh. The sun is waking up by this point, with the dim glow of Syktyvkar's street lamps fading away to make way for the light. Yet, there is brightness abound, and much work to be done.\n\nElena and Yevgeny stand up, facing the city around them. The Republic was safe, and this was an effort helped by them. Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every heated debate led to this tranquility. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?"\n\n"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all." The two nod, and shake hands.

Violence by extremists was reported six hours ago. Two hours ago, the first Zhdanov cocktail had been thrown. Now, the city streets of Syktyvkar became an all-out warzone, with different factions determined to wrestle control over the facilities of government. It seems that the worst case scenario has become reality; and now it was a time of survival.\n\nElena and Yevgeny were shocked, initially. How could all of their efforts have failed? Was the Center not united enough? Perhaps the extremists gained too much strength? Whatever the case was, both of them have been drafted to serve under an emergency government under [KOM.GetLeader]. Their goal was no longer to save democracy, but save Komi entirely from the ever-encroaching threat of radical takeover.\n\n"Yevgeny." Elena said, shakily gripping her hastily-issued pistol in its holster. "Is this a bad dream?"\n\nHis expression did not give her any condolences. Perhaps, behind his usual carefree and steely demeanor, he was terrified too. "The only way to wake up is to work together now. This time, for real. I know we can do it."\n\nPlacing a comforting hand on her shoulder, the two pass by some soldiers and walk into an emergency command room, ready to take action once more."
komi_friendship.19.a: "The strength of the Center is put to the test..."

komi_friendship.20.t: "Trial of the Counterrevolutionaries"
komi_friendship.20.d: "They woke up with bags around their head, and their hands tied with rope. All they felt was the tight grasp of somebody escorting them, and then forcing them to their knees. Elena and Yevgeny breathed heavily, as other people were forced to sit around them. The crackle of flames were present around them. What exactly happened? Their heads hurt, their hands were weary, and they felt that something was incredibly, incredibly amiss.\n\nWith a motion of one of the commissars, all of the bags were removed. Elena and Yevgeny looked around them, seeing fellow members of the Center, tied up with them as prisoners. Communist partisans and soldiers were armed, rounding up members of the democratic opposition. "Listen closely! Everyone here is considered a traitor to the Komi Provisional Soviet. You will now be tried against a People's Commissariat for crimes against our glorious revolution. How do you plead?"\n\n"Not Guilty!" Elena and Yevgeny shouted in unison. Deep down, they held onto some youthful hope that they had a chance. However, as the trial went on, as the commissars spoke, and as several assemblymen were taken away around them, it became clear that this was a show trial. This was the end. Meaningless words, piercing their defenses like tank shells, rallying the super-partisan council of judges assembled against them. They would certainly meet their deaths. However the communists decided to do it, however, was what occupied their minds.\n\n"What are you going to do to us? We did nothing wro--"\n\n"GUILTY! Let them hang alongside their collaborationist brethren."\n\nDespite their cries, despite their physical resistance, this was the end. Elena and Yevgeny, with the strike of a gavel, now had their necks wrought around a noose. They had failed. Despite all of their promises, their work would be for naught with the simple collapse of a platform. Tears escaped Yevgeny's eyes. Elena remained silent. Both of them composed themselves, with a final exhale, before their lives were taken from them as swiftly as the floor below them dropped."
komi_friendship.20.a: "The revolution eternal, but at what cost?"

komi_friendship.21.t: "Refuge"
komi_friendship.21.d: ""I'm sorry."\n\nThose were the only words which escaped Elena's mouth. The defense was failing. Around them, their safehouse was burning. Their last, desperate attempt at freedom has gone awry. Rightist paramilitary groups were winning against the final garrison defending the would-be refugees. The hallways were filled with gunfire, screams, the crackling of wood. All that they loved, all that they fought for, was finally being eviscerated in front of their very eyes. Good men died to prevent this. Worse men fought to reduce it to ash.\n\nYevgeny coughed heavily, a stray bullet still lodged in his lung. The clenched hand grasping at his gunshot wound was becoming weaker by the second. He didn't believe that he would die here. Not in some run-down records room, slumped over against a table with one of his former enemies at his side. The pistol on the ground was empty, much like the air in his body. Perhaps, if there were still some bullets left, they could fight. One last, desperate clawing attempt for liberation. Perhaps they could end their life. Surely, whatever the fascists did to them would be worse than death.\n\n"We promised... And we failed."\n\nAs Yevgeny became closer to death, the door to the record room was slammed open with a kick. A member of the fascist paramilitary, with the raise of his PPSh, filled the duo with bullets and added to brass piles on the floor. After a quick look around the room, he looks down at the victims. Whoever they were then didn't matter now; Russia would move on without them. With that concluding thought, the soldier exits the room and ducks his head low to avoid the smoke around him."

komi_friendship.22.d: "Syktyvkar was breathing again. Soldiers were putting down the last fringes of extremist resistance. Locals were rebuilding from the fighting. The president gave a heartfelt, rallying speech outside the Assembly early this morning. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the Center has survived the impossible. Democracy has survived a dangerous trial, and has emerged stronger than ever before.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sit on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. "Just like that day in the bar, huh?" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n"Your face isn't as red. Although, perhaps we may need more spirits to deal with the previous chaos." Elena suggests. The two share one genuine, hearty laugh. The sun is waking up by this point, with the dim glow of Syktyvkar's surviving street lamps fading away to make way for the light. Yet, there is brightness abound, and plenty of rebuilding to be done.\n\nElena and Yevgeny stand up, facing the city around them. The Republic was safe, and this was an effort helped by them. Every hour, every drop of sweat, and every inch of ground held led to eternal peace. It was worth it, for all of them. For all of us.\n\n"So... friends? Or are we back to foes across the aisle?"\n\n"Friends. Without people like you, even if you are not entirely with me, matter. We promised, after all." The two nod, and shake hands. As they begin to head home, they only wish for a better tomorrow, one with the wounds of the past long gone."

komi_friendship.23.t: "Into the Light"
komi_friendship.23.d: "Syktyvkar was breathing again. Soldiers were putting down the last fringes of extremist resistance. Locals were rebuilding from the fighting. Stalina was giving a national radio broadcast, denouncing the actions of the past few weeks. No longer would the Left or Right threaten an election ever again; for the efforts of the PSD's reconstruction government have triumphed over all opposing forces. Stability would no longer be a word foreign to any citizen of Komi.\n\nElena and Yevgeny sat on the steps of the National Assembly, both with shot glasses by their side. Perhaps a bit unprofessional, but for the occasion? It was worth a potential hangover and scolding. "Just like that day in the bar, huh?" Yevgeny jokes casually.\n\n"Your face isn't as red.

For all of us.\n\n"I never thought I would celebrate side-by-side with a liberal."\n\n"How about a fellow anti-extremist?" Elena replied. Yegveny nodded. "I can do that."\n\nKomi was once again safe, now under the paternal grip of Stalina to guide the nation. As the two began to walk home, Elena turned back to Yevgeny, but his eyes stayed the course forward. Despite their victory, she felt like something was lost. Something ate at her from the inside, a feeling which did not go away through her steps echoing off the pavement below her..."

komi_RNP.1.t: "No Regrets"
 komi_RNP.1.d: "The residence of Igor Shafarevich had long been of little note in the politics of the Republic despite his relative prominence. He had few visitors over, since he liked to think that he preferred the quiet solitude of a lonely evening than the trappings of a social visit. As he sipped on a glass of water, he felt his dinner digest.\n\nAs the evening's sunset cast shadows over Syktyvkar, the newly-elected president noticed his feet wandering towards his apartment's balcony. The fresh, frigid air gripped the mathematician-turned-politician's skin despite his clothes, and as he held the water in his hand, he felt his mind wander towards the future. Shafarevich had worked hard to create his coalition, to grow grassroots support in Gumilyov's camp and among the more radical members of the democratic right.\n\nHe brought to mind all the manipulation, all the backstabbing, betrayal, blackmail, and underhanded tactics that he had employed during his years as a politician in the Komi Republic. Reflecting on what he had done to get elected, a single thought crossed his mind: he didn't regret it. Not a single thing that he did he considered below what was necessary to save Russia. "I'd do it again", he said, to no one in particular. Thinking about what he said over in his mind, he amended his statement. "I will do it all again."\n\nThe wind picked up as the president-elect looked down upon the streets of the capital. The sun was setting, but it felt as if Shafarevich's work had just begun."

 komi_RNP.2.t: "Dealing with the Devil"
 komi_RNP.2.d: "Shafarevich rose from his chair, tapping his finger against the image of the bespectacled man projected against the wall. Smoke from the cigarettes clutched in the teeth and fingers of the cabinet wafted in front of the light like evening fog. "Gentlemen," began Shafarevich, "we may rule the roost now, but our rule stands on shaky ground as long as this man," the president gave the image a particularly vicious jab, "this Mephistopheles, is allowed to run rampant.\n\n"The Left will fight us at every turn, poison the public against our policies, and might just launch a coup if they're able." Shafarevich paused to draw breath, sighing like an overworked father. "The Left, and Suslov especially, pose a very real threat to our administration." A ripple of muttering flowed through the room like a gale across a pond. Shafarevich held up his hands to demand silence. "Suslov, the great devil of our time, must be removed." The mathematician raised his right hand in a fist. "The law is on our side. Suslov appreciates the rule of law, of working within the system to his own benefit. Let us crush the little spider in his own web." Shafarevich paused to sip water from a glass, "tomorrow, we'll mobilize the Assembly to institute a ban on his party. Paint Suslov as the monster he is and even the moderates will follow our lead."
 komi_RNP.2.a: "The gears of state grind against the Devil."

 komi_RNP.3.t: "The Silk Glove"
 komi_RNP.3.d: "The SMR had been more than ready to negotiate when Shafarevich had called for a private meeting. The centrists were always nervous around socialists, especially those of Suslov's caliber, and had scurried to accommodate Shaferevich, Morozov chief amongst them. The PSD had scoffed at the notion, responding with some self-righteous drivel about refusal to "be seated with an extremist president". The KPK, naturally, had not been invited at all.\n\n"Gentlemen," began Shafarevich, taking his seat at the head of the table, "I'm glad you were able to join us." Morozov inclined his head in agreement, his eyes betraying a slight unease at sitting at the same table in negotiation as a Passionariyy.\n\n"What's this about Suslov?" Morozov asked, eyebrow raised.\n\n"My friends, our nascent democracy stands on a vital precipice. We have fought, in some instances men have died, to preserve our Republic. What Voznesensky was unable to maintain through concessions and compromise, we must maintain by the rule of law."\n\n"This is Komi, gentlemen, we are no stranger to coups." The president allowed this last statement to hang in the air for a moment, the significance sinking into the assembled SMR members.\n\n"You think Suslov is planning something?" asked Morozov with a hint of alarm.\n\nShafarevich scowled, "He's Suslov, of course he is. Gentlemen, the RNP stands against extremism, against the sort of socialist nightmare that Suslov wants to unleash on Russia. I propose an emergency session early this morning. With your support, we can protect both democracy and drive the KPK back into the dustbin of history where it belongs." Shafarevich fixed Morozov with a stare, awaiting the answer he knew was coming."
 komi_RNP.3.a: ""I accept. For democracy.""

 komi_RNP.4.t: "Fear and Loathing in Syktyvkar"
 komi_RNP.4.d: "Suslov placed the phone back down on the receiver as he suppressed the urge to swallow nervously. There was no time for fear, no time to fret. There were calls to be made, papers to be burned, affairs to be put in order. Shafarevich, that fascist pretender, had held an emergency session at two o'clock and declared the KPK a terrorist organization. As always with fascists, the hammer blow would follow swiftly. If the KPK was to survive, both as a political organization and quite literally, action would need to be taken now. For an instant, he considered not informing Bukharina and Zhdanov, but thought better of it. No, the party would suffer without them, action could be taken later.\n\nIt took only ninety minutes for Suslov and his comrades to make good their escape. The old spider had put the arrangements in place months before. When the hammer fell, Suslov and his comrades were long gone, and six nondescript cars sped across the border to Vologda."
 komi_RNP.4.a: "It's not flight; it's a tactical retreat."

 komi_RNP.5.t: "The Iron Fist"
 komi_RNP.5.d: "Stupid, that's all Suslov could think when the police battered down the door of the KPK headquarters. Stupid. Did someone betray him? Zhdanov, perhaps? Suslov had been many things in his life: plotter, mastermind, chairman, hero, but never blindsided. He stayed seated as the fascist police barged inside, all noise and pointed pistols. Aides screamed and panic reigned around Suslov as the raid continued, and he let them. Why bother? Either he would escape into the night or he would be dead, there was no third option.\n\n"Mikhail Suslov," said an officer, pistol pointed in the bespectacled man's face, "you are under arrest for charges of political terrorism under section A of the Defense of Nati-". Suslov looked up at the fat, balding man with contempt.\n\n"Then don't just stand there, arrest me! If you're going to execute me, don't waste my time with justifications and statutes! Behind bars or a bullet, officer! What will it be?" Suslov calmed almost immediately, his sudden outburst seemingly forgotten. The officer wavered, working his tongue into a retort.\n\n"Bars, sir," he said finally. Suslov nodded and rose, extending his wrists.\n\n"Then let's get this over with." The cuffs slid over Suslov's thin wrists, the teeth of the clasps rasping together. The head of the KPK was lead outside. Gunshots could be heard behind him. Not everyone in the KPK was important enough to warrant a trial, and Suslov suspected that some old paramilitary scores were being settled."
 komi_RNP.5.a: "Just another night in Syktyvkar."

 komi_RNP.6.t: "The Daily Beat"
 komi_RNP.6.d: "The sentence had been life, but Suslov knew what the judge had meant. No, not the judge, what Shafarevich meant. It was a death sentence. Perhaps not today, perhaps not this year, but Suslov knew that it was only a matter of time before an unsympathetic inmate stuck a piece of glass between his ribs or the warden invented some reason for him to be shot.\n\nTime, then, was not on Suslov's side, and time was what he needed most. His list of allies was growing thin, and Suslov suspected that Bukharina and Zhdanov, if not already imprisoned, dead, or fled, would do little to aid him.\n\nThe situation was not ideal, Suslov could admit that, but perhaps-a firm hand caught Suslov in the shoulder, stopping him dead in his pacings. The guard was a big man, tall and broad and a face like crumbling masonry.\n\n"You're Mikhail Suslov," growled the guard, truncheon clenched in a meaty fist. Murder glowed in his eyes, scars criss-crossing a face used to war.\n\n"Yes?" asked Suslov, his eyes scanning the prison yard. Lost in thought, he hadn't noticed the other prisoners gradually drift away from him, leaving him and the guard alone.\n\nTime, mused Suslov, had perhaps run out. The first blow, a meaty fist slammed into his gut, drove the air from his lungs and doubled him over. The second, this one delivered by the truncheon, cracked his skull and drove him into the dirt. Suslov failed to meaningfully register any blow following the fourth. His glasses shattered as his face hit the yard, glass and dirt rubbing into the cuts on his face. Blood leaked out from between his lips, and Suslov attempted to crawl away.\n\nNo one came to his aid, guards and prisoners alike watching in silent or jeering observation. So this was how it all ended, he thought, in the dirt of the prison yard. Perhaps he would have laughed if he had some distance from his predicament. He was joining the ranks of many illustrious socialist martyrs. Wasn't this a death expected of revolutionaries?"

 komi_RNP.7.t: "A Sound of Thunder"
 komi_RNP.7.d: "It was eight in the morning, just as the legislators were beginning to trinkle into the National Assembly, when a queer whistling could be heard. It was so horribly loud and shrill that everyone in the city heard it. So hideously familiar that the old threw themselves to the ground in familiar fear and so alien that the young stared at the sky dumbstruck. It was, by all accounts, an excellent shot.\n\nRubble, dust, and shredded limbs were hurled in all directions as the high explosive shell slammed into steps of the National Assembly. A great boom like the beat of some angry god's drum resounded throughout Syktyvkar, rapidly accompanied by screams of pain and horror. Medical personnel and police swarmed the streets, cordons were established, and those who could still be saved were tended to.\n\nThis was dreadfully tragic considering the placement of the second shell.\n\nThe crowd that had gathered and the medics tending to the wounded suffered the brunt of the second explosions. Guts and blood were strewn over the pavement, the air stank of dust and copper, and every molecule and atom rang with screams. This time, personnel did not swarm, but stayed huddled in buildings or with their hands over their necks. The third shell crashed more or less harmlessly into the steps.\n\nTheories ran like blood. Was the Luftwaffe back? Was the Front invading? The culprits, it was soon revealed by a sweep of the countryside, were a cabal of Suslovite terrorists operating a captured artillery piece.\n\nLater identification determined these men were low-level street fighters: a cobbler, a factory worker, two farmers, and a sailor. All had recently escaped from prison following the roundup of KPK members. The gun had vanished from an armory a week prior, written off as an administrative error."

 komi_RNP.8.t: "We Will Endure"
 komi_RNP.8.d: "The politicians sat, huddled in fear, the stink of blood and fear still lingering in their collective memories. Terror gripped all in attendance, all save one. Shafarevich stood at the top of the podium, a sheave of papers held in his steady hand. No one chattered in the crowd, as if afraid that an errant word would bring the shells crashing back down. "Esteemed members of the National Assembly," began the president, "a great tragedy has befallen us. The unwarranted and horrific attack on this very building, upon the very foundations of democracy, cannot go unanswered." A quiet ripple of nods swept through the assembled legislators.\n\n"The blood and dust have not yet settled, the nightmare of yesterday is alive and well today. The communist monster continues to haunt us still. While we mourn, while we bury the dead, we must not grow complacent. Even the banning of the KPK did not end their evil. We must exorcise this spectre from the Russian nation forever."\n\nNods became raised fits and shouts of assent. Grief and horror were becoming rage and Shafarevich played upon it expertly. "Communism, socialism, Bukharinism, all are still rife right here in this very city! Our democracy has been beaten, bloodied by leftist hatred for our cause! Will we let this attack go unanswered? Will we sit idle as Suslovite terrorists shell our very Assembly? Gentlemen, I am not afraid! Are we frightened mice or are we Russians?"\n\nThundering cries of, "Russians!" boomed through the hall, and Shaferavich forced down the grin rising to his face.\n\n"My fellow members of the Assembly, I have in my hand a proposal for emergency measures to crack down on political terrorism..." The votes were tallied and democracy endured."

 komi_RNP.9.t: "A Little Bird"
 komi_RNP.9.d: "Shafarevich held the memo, controlling what had been a shaking hand seconds ago. The contents of the memo were treasonous, deeply damning and exceedingly dangerous. The Ministry of Defense had been meeting without him, that alone was suspicious, but what they had been speaking about...\n\n"Fuck!" shouted Shafarevich, slamming the palm of his hand against the wall. "Those roaches, those blood-sucking parasites, think they can replace me? I made them, God damn it!" Of all the phrases in the document, "possible regime change" jumped out at him again and again. Was he in danger? Who could he trust?\n\nShafarevich slumped down into his chair, finger resting on his lip as he seethed in thought. No, he reasoned, this could work to his advantage. The document had named names, including those who had dissented to the possible regime change. Could he trust those voices? No, they had still kept the meetings from him, but they could serve as potential allies. Trust was in short supply these days, and as Shafarevich himself had observed not too long ago, Komi was no stranger to coups. Something would have to be done, and soon.\n\nA little bit of blackmail might help grease the wheels. Reveal to certain ministers that he knew about the meetings and bend them to his service. Now somewhat calmed, Shafarevich picked up the phone and began to dial."

The list went on and on, the dumbstruck Grigorenko, Pokus, and Korolkov wearing masks of fear and consternation. Soloukhin, that bootlicking snake, had wasted no time in rounding them up and placing them under arrest. Soloukhin, one of the very men whom the trio had bandied about the notion of deposing Shafarevich, now sat with the prosecution, his demeanor self-satisfied. The judge continued to read, half of the charges bunkum invented to guarantee a conviction.\n\nGrigorenko stood, unable to contain himself any longer. He may have been stripped of his rank, but he still had his dignity. "Soloukhin, you roach! You sat at the table with us! We were comrades! Never would I think that Vladimir Soloukhin would sink so low." His face was beet red with rage, his skin quivering with nervous fury. Soloukhin, for his part, didn't seem overly worried.\n\n"Bailiff," he said, pointing at the raging Grigorenko, "remove this man. On second thought, remove them all, the court has heard enough." The guards advanced, the officers protested, fought back. They were past their prime, old fighters who were no match for the rifle butts and kicks of their younger enemies.\n\nThey were dragged from the court, and into a waiting armored car."

Gumilyov, Serov, Taboritsky, all strong and capable leaders in their own right, could never have done what he had just accomplished. The National Assembly, their bowels icy and their spines gelatinous after the fateful terrorist attack on that organ of state, had hastily approved and ratified the National Democracy Act. The act, for all its titular implications, had for all intents and purposes, made Igor Shafaraveich the highest authority in all of Komi.\n\nHe sniffed, taking a slug of vodka smuggled over the border from Vyakta, the tsar's spirits warming his own. Shafarevich looked out the window, glass still in hand. The National Assembly building stood against the setting sun, brilliant and radiant in the golden hour. One could almost ignore the shell damage and the throngs of protestors. Well, thought Shafarevich, he supposed he could afford to ignore them for the time being.\n\nThe president poured himself another drink and toasted to National Democracy."

The will of the masses, though of course represented in the legislature, must occasionally take a back seat to the man they elected to lead them. Undemocratic means must sometimes be employed to protect democracy. It was unfortunate, then, that the people of Komi had failed to understand that.\n\nHe snorted, of course he had passed the National Democracy Act through executive order. If the masses hadn't insisted on disrupting the proper democratic process through protests, then the act could have been implemented some other way. He supposed it didn't matter much now, as the act had empowered Shafarevich to such a degree that he had no concerns about what the masses, or the National Assembly for that matter, thought of him. Democracy was saved, he thought to himself, and as the National Assembly building was set against the setting sun, he tried to ignore the screams of the protestors and the sporadic peals of gunfire."

The failing Komi Republic has once and for all been put out of its misery via the stroke of the President's pen. A round of new laws have passed the National Assembly, dissolving the Republic and creating a new provisional State of Ust-Sysolsk, to last until our government is solidified. With no institutional opposition to oppose us, we no longer have to fear the overthrow of our regime. However, we have much work left to do.\n\nWith communists to our north, an expansionist tsarist pretender to our south, and... whatever is going on in Perm, our regime still has plenty of external threats to deal with. We must prepare our people for war. This means rebuilding industry, equipping our armies, reorganizing our military, and ensuring that our soldiers are willing to die for our cause. Once we are prepared, we shall wage war against all who seek to threaten us. In the end, Western Russia will surely be ours.

"I'm sorry, comrade, I didn't -"\n\n"It's fine, it's fine." [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] waved the young photographer off. He had to admit, this wasn't going too well. Half the people around him looked like they were afraid to do anything at all around him for fear of some reprisal, like he was a Tsar who could have them flogged at a moment's notice. What was there to be done about it, though? He remembered how they'd treated Lenin and Bukharin, and if he was going to restore Soviet order to Russia, they'd treat him like that as well.\n\nBut they liked Bukharin! The golden child, they called him, with his boyish face, his affable smile, and his charming manner. Sure, people feared Bukharin's name, but when they faced the man himself they were laughing and joking with the General Secretary. He had his disagreements with his erstwhile comrade and boss, but Nikolai had been good at one thing; making people like him. It was how he'd come to power. He'd have to calm those around him.\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] gestured to one of the Party militia officers he'd brought with him. "Hand me that cap, comrade," and he then put it on his head. "Comrade photographer! Do I look more presidential now?" he asked, smiling to the people around him. A few of the Party men dutifully laughed, and the photographer gave a stilted chuckle.

Cabinet meetings were technically not open to the public, and so to host the rest of the party leadership he needed it held away from the normal location. Though there were additional reasons for the secrecy. "This was discovered near an incinerator in the Ministry of Defense," [Get_Left_Sec_Min] began, passing copies of a dossier to the members of the cabinet. "'Case October;' as you can see, details a plan by the Republican Army to launch a military coup against the government in the case of the government falling into our hands. It was drafted by by Grigorenko and Korolkov."\n\n"I assume this was without Voznesensky's approval?" \n\n"Correct, Comrade Furtseva. They considered him an unreliable element."

"Comrade President, if they have incinerated most of the documents, then we can only assume they will strike imminently."\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] fumed. "Those bourgeois pigs."

He didn't fear Suslov, but what was he planning? \n\n[Get_Left_Sec_Min]'s voice brought him back to reality. "Comrade President, I recommend stationing the following units around Syktyvkar," he said, handing a list to the President. "I have vetted them personally, they are loyal to the revolution. We can use our paramilitaries to suppress the traitors." [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] calmed down. Calm, he'd have to be calm. Calm like Bukharin had been. But Bukharin had been...He dispelled the thought from his mind. He was not Bukharin. He would not fail."

 komi_KPK.3.t: "Workers of the Republic"
 komi_KPK.3.d: "[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] shook the hands of the Socialist Workers' Association's chairman, vice-chairman, secretary, treasurer, and what felt like an endless series of committee members. Unions, he thought contemptuously. The workers looked to them for protection the way men used to look for caves and tents for shelter. Soon there would be something far superior to give the workers of the world protection. Still, he'd deal with them for now.\n\n"Comrade President," the chairman began, "Thank you very much for meeting with us. We're extremely pleased to have a President committed to socialism and the workers' struggle."\n\n"I'm glad to hear that, comrade. But first we must build the workers' utopia before we can celebrate it, no? Let's not count our chickens before they hatch." A few chuckles came from the committee, but nothing much. [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] continued, "We have much work to do. Our paramilitaries and loyal soldiers are still attempting to sweep up the disloyal elements, and -"\n\n"Actually, Comrade President, we were hoping to discuss something else," the chairman interrupted. "Before we can discuss any of these measures, we need assurances."\n\n"Assurances? Comrades, you bewilder me, what assurances do you need?"\n\n"The old Union subordinated workers' associations to the Party before. We understand the role of the vanguard in the revolution, Comrade President, but Bukharin's experiment ignored the role of the workers in favor of bureaucrats - present company excluded, of course." [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] stared at them, trying his best to hide his contempt."

 komi_KPK.4.d: ""General Grigorenko, I have another one," the aide said as he handed another slip of paper to Grigorenko. The chief of staff examined it.\n\nColonel Arkady Bezmonov, an officer with a decent enough record; served in the Great Patriotic War, Operation Suvorov, joined the Republican Army rather than join up with the Front or with the KPK paramilitaries...Ah, that was it. A minor infraction when he hadn't paid enough at a cafe once in 1960 was the only real misdeed, and indeed was the one listed as the reason for his discharge, but Grigorenko had noted Bezmonov before, for his refusal to allow KPK propaganda leaflets to be distributed in his unit. The discharge order had been signed by the President himself. The fifth one this week.\n\nGrigorenko tossed the discharge order aside. Did [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] know? They'd incinerated all the October files. Or had they? There had always been Communist infiltrators, had a copy been leaked? No, it couldn't have been.\n\nDamn the October files, though. Either way, [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] was beginning to saw the branch beneath the Republican Army, and it was only a matter of time until Grigorenko would fall down with it."

Get in there," the supposed military policeman growled, motioning to a conference room. Grigorenko stepped through to the sight of Koroklov and Panin sitting around a table and Defense Minister [Get_Left_Sec_Min] standing at the head.\n\n"Ah, Petro, come in," [Get_Left_Sec_Min] snarked. "I was here to deliver the good news." He pulled out three letters and handed each of them to their intended recipients. Grigorenko opened his and quickly scanned it, and as soon as he read the gist of it he heard Panin shout.\n\n"Discharged?! We've been dishonorably discharged?! You can't -"\n\n"Yes, I can. We discovered those Case October files. We have your signatures, we have your orders, we have enough to put you in front of a firing squad. You're lucky we haven't already."\n\n"Why not just hand us the letters?"\n\n"Come now, Petro, you're proven traitors. We can't risk you choosing to try and start your revolt early. Now, please follow the officers outside." The military police officers opened the door, and the three began to step outside. Grigorenko turned in the doorway and glared at [Get_Left_Sec_Min]. "You won't get away with this. We're the most popular generals in the Army. We're heroes, you can't get away with this!"\n\n[Get_Left_Sec_Min] smirked.

 komi_KPK.6.d: ""The military has mostly been secured, comrades. We have passed the first test of the return to true popular rule, but it is just the first. We now have a second and, arguably, more pressing. The Passionariyy." Furtseva handed out dossiers to the cabinet members. "As liberal capitalism collapses into its inevitable demise, many look to the light of socialism as the future, but others among the middle class and some...misguided proletarians look to the past, to the esotericism of Gumilyov and his cronies."\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] shrugged. "We can deal with them easily. We can strangle them by cutting off their voter base and disrupting their meetings and fundraising, and use the police to break them up."\n\n"Would that it were so simple, Comrade President," Furtseva bemoaned. "As you are doubtlessly aware, our former comrade, Serov, has joined the Passionariyy in his naked revisionism and powerlust. He is intimately aware of our security procedures, our structure, and our weaknesses. Most importantly, his Ordosocialist paramilitaries are extremely dangerous. All ex-Red Army or ex-NKVD. They're not Gumilyov's lambs, they have no compunction with killing, and Serov has no compunction with having them do so."\n\nThe cabinet thought the matter over, before a voice in the shadows whispered quietly. "Comrades. Everyone here is aware that whoever the people hate the Germans the most. They have taken everything from us, and everyone on the street knows at least someone who died to German bombs or bullets. And what is Serov if not a fascist?" Mikhail Suslov leaned into the light. "What is the greatest friend of the fascist if not the German?"\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] faced his former protege. "We know they are likely Nazi collaborators, but we can't prove it to the people."\n\n"Comrade President, we have his manifesto. And you know as well as I that where evidence is absent it can be 'found.' And they collaborate with Serov. And then, once the people see these Germanophiles for what they are...""

 komi_KPK.7.d: ""What you're proposing is preposterous," Rodionov said. "An alliance with you to get rid of the Passionariyy? How do we know you won't turn on us next?"\n\n"Comrade Rodionov, please," [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] reassured, "I can promise that you and your various parties will be allowed to legally operate in the Republic. Provided, of course, that you commit to keeping within the legal strictures of Republican norms and laws."\n\n"Pah! You're one to talk about 'the legal strictures.' Just last month, KPK paramilitaries were shooting at me as I walked to the cafe!"\n\n[Get_Left_President_Last_Name] sighed. "The violence of the past and of my party are both regrettable, and must be averted from here on out. But we have moved on; the Party has realized the errors of paramilitary violence, and now seeks to function legitimately." He couldn't help but notice the nodding of the DSNP delegates next to Rodionov. Each had been blackmailed by Suslov's intelligence apparatus beforehand. [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] would have to find out what else Suslov knew eventually, but for now he was only grateful.\n\nRodionov, considering the mood of his compatriots, mused on the potential deal in front of him. "We can agree to ban the Passionariyy, in exchange for certain concessions. First, the disestablishment of the KPK's paramilitary. Second, a commitment to abide by Republican principles, including multiparty democracy. Third, an official condemnation of past terrorist actions by the KPK in public."\n\n"Done," [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] smiled, then shook Rodionov's hand. "I'm glad to see we can be reasonable men. And you can rest assured, gentlemen...""

 komi_KPK.8.t: "Exit, Stage Right"
 komi_KPK.8.d: "Shaferevich had known this was coming for some time now. He had watched the polls, done the math, and guessed that the Communists would win. Once [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] was in power, it wasn't difficult to guess where it was going. Gumilyov didn't listen, Serov seemed more excited for a fight than anything. Of all the people in the Passionariyy, he hadn't expected Taboritsky to be the one to nod silently when he had brought up his predictions. He'd been prepared for some time. Whatever happened to the rest was no matter; he had to get going while the going was good, and that window was closing.\n\nThe truck pulled up in the lot he had planned out. It stopped, and the driver stepped out. "You need help with that luggage?"\n\n"Sure, please." The driver helped load suitcase after suitcase into the back, then got back into the truck. Shaferevich, holding a book, a piece of scratch paper, and a pencil got into the passenger seat. With that, they drove off into the Syktyvkar night.\n\n"So what's your story?" the driver asked.\n\nShaferevich paused, nervously, then answered as truthfully as he could. "I'm a mathematics professor. I taught courses at the local university until relatively recently."\n\n"Ah, that sounds like a good gig. Why'd you leave?"\n\n"My employment was, uh... terminated, recently. Have to find a new job."\n\n"What happened?"\n\n"Disagreement with the boss." The driver nodded, and Shaferevich thought it over. He'd acquired forged documents that could get him through WRRF territory, from there into Onega, and then on to Helsinki. It could be worse, he told himself. They might need professors in Helsinki. Come to think of it, he'd heard that the streets there needed an improvement. He took out the paper and pencil, thinking of a new way to organize the flow of urban traffic. It would be a quiet life as an exile, he thought, but at least it would be life."

 komi_KPK.9.d: "Lieutenant Popov wasn't a communist, but he was a loyal soldier of the Republic. If the President said the rightists were traitors, then that was enough for him. At least [Get_Left_President_Last_Name] was obeying the rules of the system, unlike Gumilyov and his ilk. He marched through the hallway of the Passionariyy's headquarters, at the head of a veritable stream of soldiers through the door. Time to put the traitors down.\n\nHe knocked on the locked door of Gumilyov's office. "Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov!" he announced. "The building is surrounded! Come quietly and face prosecution for your crimes!" Nothing inside, except the faint sound of a window being opened. He grunted, then had the two soldiers accompanying him kick down the door.\n\nThe office, full of shelves and books, was dark and devoid of people save one man. He stood in front of an open window, holding a rope tied to his heavy desk, then looked at the door. His eyes filled with fear as he saw the soldiers, then he tried to climb through the window. Popov grabbed his legs as he tried to escape and dragged him back inside the office. Gumilyov squirmed on the ground as Popov slapped handcuffs on him, then pulled him to his feet and forced him through the door.\n\nOutside, he threw Gumilyov into the same truck as a bulky, raging figure in an old uniform then shut the door. He turned to a beaten and bruised Sergeant Fedorov. "Serov, I presume?"\n\n"No, it's some other ex-NKVD thug that took three men to subdue."\n\n"Hmm." He checked his list. Gumilyov and Serov were in custody, but where were Taboritsky and Shaferevich? He sighed as the minutes went on and the missing Passionarists remained missing. Eventually, as trucks were loaded with guards, archivists, and others, he decided his work was done."

 komi_KPK.10.d: "Gumilyov and Serov, once the masters of the Pasionaryy and contenders for the throne of Komi, rattled along in the back of the truck, their heads hidden by black bags. Shackles bound their hands and feet, clinking with every bump in the road. Serov sat with his back straight, feet planted firmly on the floor. As a former member of the NKVD, he had no illusions about what was at the end of their road and he embraced it. Gumilyov, bent over in his seat, felt sick. Not only from the certainty he was about to die, but from the jostling and jumping of the truck along the pot-holed road. He had once said that you couldn't kill an idea, but now that he was facing his almost certain death, he supposed that a bullet in the head might kill any ideas he could have.\n\nThe truck squealed to a halt, and the KPK thugs in the back of the truck with the two Pasionaryy bosses hauled them to their feet. The bags were torn from their faces, and Gumilyov blinked and swore as the light hit his retinas. It was, he supposed, a nice day. Birds chirped, leaves crunched under his feet. At least he would die in his beloved Eurasia. Serov was an impassive giant, who knew what was going on in that contradictory mind of his.\n\n"End of the line, fascists," said a guard holding a submachine gun, "any last words?"\n\nGumilyov shrugged, why not? "Eura-" The guard pumped bullets into the Eurasianist, light glinting through the holes punched into him. Gumilyov's shredded body fell to the ground without a sound. The guards chuckled at their little jest.\n\nSerov said nothing, just fixed the shooter with dead, hateful eyes. The guards didn't play with him, simply shooting Serov between the eyes and letting him drop."

Western Russia may be home to our ideological allies in Arkhangelsk, but many of our neighbours seek to destroy the revolution once and for all. Tsarists, fascist collaborators, and whatever abomination the Aryan Brotherhood have become, they all wish to see us and our cause dead. We must consolidate ourselves.
