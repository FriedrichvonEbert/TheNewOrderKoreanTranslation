 PER_German_Persian_Oil_Company:0 "Deutsch-Persische Ölgesellschaft"
 PER_German_Persian_Oil_Company_desc:0 "Originally the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, ownership of the corporation was transferred to Germany during the division of the British Empire at the end of the Second World War. Rebranded as the Deutsch-Persische Ölgesellschaft (DPÖ), the Company controls every drop of oil in Iran and dictates what pittance of the profit we receive from its sales."
 PER_Mosaddeghs_Legacy:0 "Mosaddegh's Legacy"
 PER_Mosaddeghs_Legacy_desc:0 "Our nation still vividly remembers the 1953 Coup against the government of then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. Orchestrated by Germany following Mosaddegh's nationalisation of the DPÖ, many both domestically and internationally view the coup as the death of Iranian democracy. With the installation of a Pro-German regime and the Shah greatly empowered, the trust between our government and the people will take a long time to heal, should it ever heal at all."
 PER_The_Imperial_Guard:0 "The Imperial Guard"
 PER_The_Imperial_Guard_desc:0 "Fiercely loyal to the Shah, the Imperial Guard are the most elite combat units in the Middle East. Acting as the Shah's personal guard and serving as an elite branch of the army, many of our nation's finest soldiers come from its ranks. With some of the most modern equipment, harshest training and strictest recruitment tests in the world they are the true heirs to the Persian Immortals of old."

 POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_REZA_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ascended to the Iranian throne in 1941, his father forced into abdication during an abortive invasion from the Soviet Union and British Empire. International scholars have since argued that this was when the Shah first became sympathetic to the German Reich, two great empires bullied by the old European empires. \n\nThe decades since his ascension to the throne have seen the relationship between the Shah and his German friends grow ever closer, Germany making every effort to begin bringing Iran into their sphere following the war with all manner of recovery aid, international loans and military advisors. It was a relationship which was exposed to the world in August 1953 with the German orchestrated coup against then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and the installation of a firmly pro-German government, with the Shah greatly empowered and openly welcoming the German Reich into Iran.\n\nYet whilst the Shah may now enjoy the power and luxuries worthy of a true monarch, to say that the ground beneath him is shaky would be a great understatement. Having lost the trust of the populace, the Iranian people take to the streets to demand all manner of reform, with an influx of German racial theory inflaming all manner of racial conflicts within Iran. So too have his German benefactors began to demand reform, seeking a more liberal Iran which may remain in their Sphere to a one aflame. Now with the 2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarch imminent, the Shah is determined to ensure it can last for 2,500 years more."

 PER_GER.1.d:0 "Shahbanu Pahlavi,\n\nWe know the enemy coalition amassed against you is tremendous, and that you are outnumbered. In this vital hour, you can not under any circumstances lose faith and give in to foriegn and domestic pressures! You must stand your ground; even in the face of such opposition.\n\n Our government is mobilizing aid, including men, as you read this. The first wave of Wehrmacht volunteers should be arriving shortly, followed by a steady stream of supplies. Until then, the Imperial army must hold its favorable positions. The enemy alliance arrayed against you is fragil; time is against them. Their unity will waver, sooner or later. Until that time arrives, we will stand by you in your hour of need."
