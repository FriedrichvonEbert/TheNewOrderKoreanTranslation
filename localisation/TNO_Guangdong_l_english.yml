 #Leader Descriptions
    POLITICS_SUZUKI_TEIICHI_DESC:0 "A decorated IJA officer and former head of the Cabinet Planning Board, Suzuki Teiichi was intimately involved in the construction of Japan's wartime economy and the subsequent economic planning for the Japanese New Order in Asia. An esteemed member of the House of Peers since 1943, Prime Minister Ino has named Suzuki the next Chief Executive of the State of Guangdong in order to use his Chinese experience, military connections, and economic expertise to bend Guangdong's corporations to the will of Tokyo.\n\nHis hands-on and statist approach to running Guangdong's freewheeling economy rankles the Four Companies of Guangdong, which have become accustomed to running Guangdong with minimal interference. However, the culture of corruption fostered by years of weak oversight from Tokyo - and the backing of Yasuda Bank, per Prime Minister Ino's instructions - is enough for Suzuki to keep the Four Companies in line for now.\n\nSuzuki sees a territory blinded by greed, forgetful of its obligations and unaware of the consequences of its actions. While he has no special affection for the Chinese in Guangdong, he is keenly aware that without the resources from Tokyo to maintain a strong security apparatus (as in Manchukuo), naked repression is not a sustainable solution to Chinese dissident activity. For the good of Japan, Suzuki will lay the foundations of a new, stronger Guangdong - and bring the corporate behemoths and their executives to heel."
    POLITICS_MATSUZAWA_TAKUJI_DESC:0 "'In every crisis, lies great opportunity', so the Western saying goes - unless you're Matsuzawa Takuji, in which case the more apt Eastern aphorism might be 'the carp on the cutting board.' With Yasuda Bank being taken apart by its creditors, the political establishment, and the media in Tokyo, Matsuzawa had his hands full simply putting the company's affairs in order in Guangdong. That is, until the former Chief Executive abandoned ship, with the remaining tycoons pushing the poisoned chalice into Matsuzawa's hands.\n\nWith communications from Tokyo all but severed, Matsuzawa has not been formally appointed by the Japanese government to his position. Nor does he have the luxury of waiting: the aftershock of Yasuda's collapse and the political turmoil in Tokyo has left Guangdong's budget deep in the red, scaring investors even as the local populace turn to crime and vice to make up for lost wages. The remaining tycoons jockey for position with honeyed words and convenient 'plans', no doubt aiming to become Chief Executive themselves once the dust clears.\n\nAlthough Matsuzawa savors the clarity of knowing that his assignment to Guangdong was the work of a corrupt cabal working against him, the fallout from their schemes has led to his entire life's work crumbling to dust around him. There is no coming back from this, no matter how innocent he was; he is a dead man walking, and all he can do is to keep it all together until the curtains close."
    POLITICS_MORITA_AKIO_DESC:0 ""The Gadgeteer of Guangdong." "The Man Who Fought the Zaibatsu." "The Japanese Washout." Morita Akio is known by many names, all of which are true to a degree.  Despite his prestigious origins - a graduate of Osaka Imperial University and a member of the IJN's Wartime Research Group - Morita washed ashore in Guangdong after a falling-out with his once-friend, Ibuka Masaru, over the acquisition of Tokyo Telecommunications Company in 1952.\n\nWith little more than memorized schematics - and the assistance of his long-time associate, Li Ka-Shing of Cheung Kong Enterprises - Morita clawed his way back up the corporate ladder in Guangdong in the 1950's, selling high-quality audio-visual electronics in Guangdong and the Republic of China. With Sony's accession into the Four Companies in 1960, Morita became the lone voice of reform, fighting to make his adopted home of Guangdong both an economic powerhouse and a better place for the Zhujin community he has come to represent.\n\nA long decade in the shadow of the Japanese has convinced Morita and Li that for Guangdong to survive, it must become more than just a playground for the corporations - but a place that its people can call a home. Few of Guangdong's Japanese establishment think he will succeed - but even fewer expected Morita to come back swinging from his fall from grace, let alone speak out against them. He will not stop now."
    POLITICS_MATSUSHITA_MASAHARU_DESC:0 "To many, Matsushita Masaharu has lived a charmed life, an anointed heir to one of Japan's most prominent electronics firms. Born to the peerage and an elite graduate of Tokyo Imperial University, Masaharu gave up his career as a financier in Sumitomo Bank to marry the daughter of Matsushita Electric's founder - Matsushita Konosuke, a living legend for his rise from elementary school dropout to one of Japan's few non-Zaibatsu corporate titans.\n\nWhile Matsushita Sr. leads the company from Osaka, Masaharu has been its operational head since 1960, overseeing its expansion into China from his offices in Kōshu. As the son of the founder, serving as both corporate executive and government administrator, it would seem that Masaharu had no reason to fear for his future. But his close acquaintances knew otherwise.\n\nNeither an engineer by training nor a salesman by habit, Matsushita Masaharu is keenly aware of his outsider status within both Matsushita and Guangdong. With every passing year, the two Matsushitas grow apart, with Masaharu wondering when he would ever be entrusted with the reins - if at all - while navigating a political tightrope in the Legislative Council. Now, as Guangdong's Chief Executive, he has the opportunity to show his detractors - his tycoon colleagues and his own adoptive father amongst them - that he is everything he promised he would be, building a literal empire for Matsushita in the Pearl River Delta."
    POLITICS_IBUKA_MASARU_DESC:0 "Few can compare with Ibuka Masaru's talent and relentless drive for excellence; even fewer can compare to his boundless ambition and political and business acumen. A relentless advance up the corporate ladder, endless lobbying, politicking, and economic maneuvering has made Ibuka few friends and many enemies.\n\nFrom ostracizing Tokyo Telecoms co-founder and his one-time friend Morita Akio to merging with and consolidating his control over Fujitsu Electric, Ibuka's relentless ambition would see Fujitsu expand its operations to the Pearl River. An expansion that would see Ibuka clash with Morita's Sony in a legendary legal battle over control of Guangdong's radio market.\n\nThose days, however, are in the past. Following the collapse of Suzuki's government in the Yasuda crash, Ibuka once more maneuvered Fujitsu into a position of dominance. Now, as Guangdong's undisputed master, Ibuka Masaru finally has the freedom necessary to finally bring about his vision for a new, transistorized, digitized world.\n\nNo longer restrained by the whims of his fellow executives or beholden to shareholders in Tokyo, Ibuka alone can see the future, and Ibuka alone can bring about the new tomorrow. With Guangdong as his canvas, his only limit is ambition, and Ibuka has no intention of coming up short."

    # Minister LOC
    GNG_Matsuzawa_Takuji_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LThe Representative Director of Yasuda Bank's Guangdong branch since 1959, Matzuawa Takuji runs the financial conglomerate's operations in Guangdong - which are but one part of a sprawling financial network that stretches from Tokyo to Calcutta. Yasuda's prominent position as the only one of the Big Four zaibatsu among the Four Companies means that Matsuzawa also serves as the de facto second-in-command of the civil government, the Chief Secretary, on top of his corporate duties.\n\nAfter a distinguished career in the Home Islands managing major corporate clients and the Ministry of Finance, Matsuzawa was rumored to be a prime candidate to join the board of directors, making his assignment to Guangdong a surprise - most so to Matsuzawa himself. Yasuda's recent turn towards breakneck overseas expansion (as encouraged by Prime Minister Ino's government) might partially explain things, but many still wonder as to the true reason why Matsuzawa was sidelined - and whether it simply reflects differences over business strategy, or something more.§!"
    GNG_Ibuka_Masaru_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LIbuka Masaru is known for two things - his towering command of electrical engineering, and his many, many 'opinions'. The former has served him well as the President of Fujitsu, the electronics subsidiary of the Furukawa zaibatsu, while the latter makes him an outspoken defender of the Four Companies' interests in Tokyo - and Nanjing, when he can be bothered to leave his workstation to venture into China.\n\nApart from his professional history, Ibuka is well-known for his longstanding feud with Morita Akio of Sony, after the two parted ways acrimoniously in 1952 following the acquisition of their joint venture, Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering, by the Furukawa group. In the years since, Ibuka has tirelessly sought to realize his vision of a transistorized future, rising through the ranks at Fujitsu and aggressively expanding its presence in Guangdong - no matter what Morita or anyone else thinks.§!"
    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LMatsushita Masaharu is the heir apparent to Matsushita Electric, invited by the esteemed Matsushita Konosuke to be his successor - and yet the two could hardly be more different. Where Konosuke is one of Japan's vanishingly rare self-made men, an elementary school dropout who cut his teeth selling electrical fans door-to-door in Osaka, Masaharu was born to the peerage, a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University and elite financier who took on the Matsushita name upon marrying into the family in 1940.\n\nWorldly, urbane, and refined, Matsushita took to his duties at Matsushita Electric with a grace and sophistication not out of place in Tokyo' s boardrooms - and befitting his role as Guangdong's Financial Secretary. But where most see a worthy heir to the Matsushita empire, the two Matsushitas are rumored to have grown apart - the elder increasingly critical of his heir's abilities, and the younger seeking to prove his twenty-year apprenticeship was not in vain.§!"
    GNG_Miyazaki_Kiyotaka_sec_desc:0 "------------\n§LOne would be mistaken to see Colonel Miyazaki Kiyotaka as another enforcer of Japan's will in Guangdong, or a relic of Japan's past triumphs. Unlike the new IJA recruits rotated into the Three Pearls - or the ancient general officers sent out to pasture - Colonel Miyazaki is a twenty-year veteran of the China Campaign still in his prime. Starting as a non-commissioned Kenpeitai officer during WWII, Miyazaki has spent nearly all of his career on the Chinese mainland, hunting KMT remnants and dissidents in Manchukuo, the Republic of China, and now in Guangdong.\n\nTo the Chinese residents of Guangdong, he is an implacable predator, coming after those who test the patience of the police and the Japanese once too often. To the Japanese, he is a tireless defender of law and order, a swift and final arbiter for any problem too intractable to buy off. All know that Colonel Miyazaki is a dangerous man - a man with power, and almost limitless authority along with it.§!"

    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_Yasuda_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LThe delicate politics of the Legislative Council and the Four Companies requires an exceptional skill at negotiating, and Matsushita is nothing if not a master of the art. When Matsushita, Ibuka, and Morita maneuvered their powerless colleague, Matsuzawa, into 'stepping in' as interim Chief Executive, it was abundantly clear that power would be principally in the hands of the three remaining tycoons.\n\nYet the management of power between multiple people is a tricky thing: Morita and Ibuka were already well known for their frequent and heated disagreements, and favoring either of them above the other could easily upend the delicate balance of power - and give Matsuzawa more power than he really ought to have. For the sake of peace between the Companies, Matsushita was the natural choice to serve as the Chief Secretary of Guangdong, a crucial - and not entirely unbiased - interlocutor between the Chief Executive and his peers.§!"
    GNG_Morita_Akio_Yasuda_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LEven as one of the heads of the Four Companies, Morita Akio and Sony had always been an outsider - comfortably outvoted by Yasuda, Matsushita, and Fujitsu combined. Yet, as Yasuda careens towards its dissolution and Chief Executive Suzuki abandons his post, Morita is one of three men standing between Guangdong and total chaos. It stood to reason that along with his new responsibilities, he would receive a title befitting his position.\n\nMorita knows full well there are ways to signal displeasure even amongst insiders: the External Secretary is a glorified PR position at the best of times, and an easy target for criticism in times of crisis. But even his small seat at the table gives him access to the Chief Executive - one who eyes the naked maneuvering of Matsushita and Ibuka as warily as Morita does. As for Morita - he is both the man with a plan, and a man who can be trusted, and he will not let this crisis go to waste.§!"
    GNG_Ibuka_Masaru_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LAt first glance, the lateral movement of Ibuka Masaru from the External Affairs to the Financial Affairs portfolio is an unquestionable snub - the most outspoken opposition to the former Chief Executive, being forced to share power with his rivals. Yet Ibuka himself appears content with his position - in public. The new interim Chief Executive will be capably advised, he says, by the remaining tycoons in a strictly professional and meritocratic manner. There can be no playing favorites in the wake of Yasuda's collapse.\n\nOf course, his insistence on 'meritocracy' has long been understood as a favorite phrase of his, with only Ibuka himself up to the task of saving Guangdong. Even if Matsushita maintains the appearance of neutrality, and Morita tries to make himself heard, Ibuka controls the pursestrings - and the numbers never lie. Tough times will require tough choices, and only one man can make them: Ibuka.§!"

    GNG_Li_Ka_Shing_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LA man of humble origins and means, Li Ka-Shing cuts an unlikely presence as Guangdong's only major tycoon of purely Chinese origins. Few would have guessed that the elementary school dropout and struggling factory owner would become the representative of the Chinese side of Guangdong's Zhujin community - and neither would have Li, were it not for a chance meeting with Morita Akio in 1952 that changed his life forever.\n\nAs the head of Cheung Kong Holdings - a sprawling local conglomerate with its fingers in retail, distribution, light manufacturing, and real estate - Li's commercial success has been intimately tied to Morita's rise in Guangdong. From business partners in the 1950's to their eventual formal alliance as Li diversified into new industries, it is an open secret in Guangdong that the two are political allies, with Li keeping tabs on the pulse of the Chinese and Zhujin population while Morita pitches their reform program to the Japanese expatriate community.§!"
    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LMatsushita is well aware of the value of keeping one's cards close to one's chest, for there is no benefit to the naked pursuit of power if one ends up empty-handed. As Morita maneuvered himself into pole position against Ibuka in the race to lead Guangdong in the aftermath of Yasuda's collapse, Matsushita ordered his men in the Legislative Council to throw their weight behind Morita's ascension - and was duly rewarded with the post of External Secretary.\n\nThere is no real closeness between Matsushita and Chief Executive Morita. Both men see each other as means to an end - an olive branch to the corporate loyalists in the Legislative Council for Morita, and as a guarantor of Matsushita's continued relevance for Matsushita. Power rewards winners, but it also rewards survivors - and as the Corporate faction's man on the inside, Matsushita has all the power he needs.§!"
    GNG_Stanley_Ho_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LStanley Ho is a 'legitimate trader' of prodigious talent and of murky origins, a long acquaintance of Morita Akio and Li Ka-shing, and the darling of Guangdong society - to the extent that a part-Chinese, part-European man can climb in a world dominated by the Japanese. Born to Dutch Jewish and Chinese parents and initially destined for a bright future in British Hong Kong, Stanley was driven to Macau during WWII, and rebuilt his wealth by working - and then running - export-import businesses of luxuries (both legal and illegal) to Mainland China.\n\nAt first glance, a man of Stanley's background would be wholly unwelcome in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. And yet, the Japanese find themselves strangely open to his charms - whether it be by his cosmopolitan wit, his access to fine luxuries, his peerless manners on the dance floors of Makao, or the encouragement of some of his less legitimate 'partners' in the Triads.§!"
    GNG_Kan_Omori_sec_desc:0 "------------\n§LAs Chief Executive Morita seeks to revamp the division of labor between the Guangdong Police Force and the Kenpeitai, it has become abundantly clear that new leadership is required at the top. Omori Kan - a senior Home Ministry bureaucrat with abundant experience in both police and military liaison positions in Japan - has been handpicked to lead a complete restructuring of the Guangdong Police after a lengthy selection process led by the Chief Executive himself.\n\nThe appointment of an outsider without extensive pre-existing ties in Guangdong has raised eyebrows in the Legislative Council and in Kenpeitai command, wary that the police will develop an autonomous streak. They are right to worry - and they will soon learn that Omori is not a man that can be bought easily, and a man to be ignored at their own peril.§!"

    GNG_Ibuka_Masaru_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LAs Guangdong's Chief Secretary, Ibuka's appointment to the second-highest position in the civil government should represent a triumph - the reassertion of the Corporate faction's authority in the Legislative Council, with Matsushita at its head and with Ibuka by his side, and Hitachi's Komai waiting in the wings.\n\nWhile the dominance of the Corporate faction is a welcome development, only a fool would think Ibuka is satisfied by this arrangement. Despite having the Chief Executive's position slip through his fingertips, Ibuka has not abandoned his desire to see Guangdong become the vanguard of the silicon revolution to the world. To the extent by which he can bring said revolution about through the ear of Chief Executive Matsushita, he will do so - for although he has no love for menial minds in positions of power, he concedes that they do have their uses...§!"
    GNG_Morita_Akio_Matsushita_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LFor Morita Akio, being kept in the position of External Secretary under Chief Executive Matsushita is a consolation prize - an example of how he failed to seize his moment. With the Corporate faction once again outnumbering his and Li Ka-shing's State faction in the Legislative Council, Morita knows that once again, he is condemned to serve in the role of the eternal opposition.\n\nIt could be worse - he could have been shut out of the Chief Executive's cabinet, as was the case before Yasuda's fall. Morita wouldn't have been kept on without his being of some use - no doubt to serve as a counterweight to Ibuka Masaru of Fujitsu. So be it! Morita knows better than anyone how all-encompassing Ibuka's ambition is - and Matsushita will soon find that Morita is a far better confidante than Ibuka could ever be.§!"
    GNG_Yokoi_Hideki_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LRugged industrialist. Vulture capitalist. Underhanded entrepreneur. Yokoi Hideki's reputation is as large as the portfolio of business interests he manages across the Sphere - acquired in lockstep with Japan's expansion across Asia. Building a fortune selling uniforms to the Japanese military during the Second World War, Yokoi leveraged his network of military contacts to purchase 'liberated' European real estate and investment properties in Asia at bargain prices - building a business empire from the loot and plunder of conquest.\n\nThough Yokoi takes great pain to appear respectable, he is often seen by Japan and Guangdong's business elite as unsophisticated new money. Few dare say so to his face, however, lest they end up receiving a visit from Yokoi's 'friends' in the Yakuza - and Yokoi understands that fear works as well as respect in almost every instance.§!"
    GNG_Tsuchida_Kuniyasu_sec_desc:0 "------------\n§LTsuchida Kuniyasu, the new Commissioner of the Guangdong Police, has his work cut out for him. The Police are chronically underfunded, understaffed, and deeply corrupt - a state of decrepitude tacitly acknowledged under previous Chief Executives, who preferred to turn to the Kenpeitai as their instruments of blunt power.\n\nNow, as the Chief Executive [GetLeader] reasserts their authority in Guangdong, they turn to Commissioner Tsuchida to get the ball rolling. A competent enforcer and administrator in his own right, Tsuchida brings familiarity with both Guangdong's way of doing business and the key figures of the Corporate elite - a man who can be trusted to clean up the police and to do things their way, without being beholden to the IJA or the Kenpeitai. Guangdong shall be brought to order under law and copyright, and Tsuchida is intimately familiar with both.§!"

    GNG_Matsushita_Masaharu_Ibuka_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LThe Corporate faction in the Legislative Council is ascendant, and Matsushita Masaharu helps lead the charge as the second-in-command in Ibuka's Guangdong. A distant second-in-command, as it were: a visionary as driven as Ibuka is loath to surrender control of his project even temporarily, and Matsushita finds himself operating almost purely in an administrative role, managing the minutiae of power in Ibuka's name.\n\nIf Matsushita is unhappy with this arrangement, he scarcely shows it. Ibuka's radical ideas have fostered incredible opposition in the Legislative Council, and Matsushita is not so wedded to Ibuka's vision to tie himself to the mast. Matsushita will grow so long as the Corporate faction remains in power - and for Matsushita, that is an acceptable, if suboptimal, outcome...§!"
    GNG_Komai_Kenichiro_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LPlenty question why Hitachi's Komai Kenichiro, only recently invited into the Legislative Council, was selected to be the external face of Ibuka's regime. Komai was already seen as an outsider, seen as an agent of Manchuria's state-dominated economy in the freewheeling corporate ecosystem of Guangdong. Would being forced to defend Guangdong to outsiders separate Komai from his masters in Hsinking?\n\nThe truth is that Ibuka doesn't trust Komai one bit - but he would rather keep any potential assets close at hand. It would certainly be better than bringing his nemesis, Morita Akio, into Guangdong's government once again - and Komai's emphasis on efficiency and profit is a thought process Ibuka understands, even if it comes with a particularly Manchurian brand of brutality.§!"
