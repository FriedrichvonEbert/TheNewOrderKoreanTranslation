 POLITICS_FERNANDO_DIAS_DESC:0 "With the collapse of Iberia, Admiral Fernando de Quintanilha e Mendonça Dias lost everything. His home - in ashes. His country - shattered into a dozen warring states. His beloved navy - as divided as the rest of its nation. As the governor of Goa, not only had he faced a string of corruption charges, but was also held responsible by the Iberian government when India invaded and reclaimed the enclave. In the years that followed, the disgraced admiral became a perpetual nuisance to both the navy and colonial authorities. His constant attempts to atone by proposing reforms to virtually every government body relevant to naval or colonial affairs only made him more of a pariah - not just a corrupt and weak commander, but also one unable to accept his failure and resign like a man.\n\nThe night after his beloved homeland disintegrated into war, Fernando could be heard alternating between deranged laughter and uncontrolled sobbing in his cabin. The following morning, to the surprise of his clique of officers, an entirely different Fernando emerged. Grinning from ear to ear and promising a shot at riches unlike any seen before while still keeping out of the conflict, he put forth a bold plan: to seize the Gibraltar dam and the surrounding area, using loyal men to fortify it against any aggressors and establishing a free, safe zone at the gateway to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe best, of course, was yet to come. Direct control of the dam itself, combined with Fernando's significant naval force, meant that control of the water-locks allowing passage through the dam was entirely in his hands. Tolls were his to extract as he pleased, and so long as the cash kept flowing his followers were happy to go along with it. The admiral's wealth accumulated at an astonishing rate, and before long the dam was bustling with foreign visitors and refugees from Iberia. In his office atop the dam, Fernando reclines in a haze of opium and port wine, smiling and casting aside the weight of his crimes, even as his now-forgotten homeland burns and its people suffer."
