ENG_Own_Peoples_Hate:0 "Own People's Hate"
ENG_Own_Peoples_Hate_desc:0 "The Douglas-Home Government has the distinction of being the only government to last more than four years since the end of the war with Germany. Unfortunately, it is not popular with a good many of the people it rules despite this. The exact reasons vary, from perceived illegitimacy to discontent with the state of England and even the simple desire to avenge those killed by the Germans or the Collaborationist Government. This lack of public support limits the government's ability to meaningfully pass legislation as the Royal Party and its factions rest on the knife's edge of becoming outright despised by an otherwise apathetic population. Fixing this will be a challenge to say the least."

ENG_HMMLR:0 "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance"
ENG_HMMLR_desc:0 "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance has been a persistent annoyance for over a decade, absorbing the communist and rogue military units which formed the majority of the resistance to government authority pre-London Uprising. Evidence suggests however that the organisation formed mere moments after our surrender to Germany, and their worrisome ability to stay largely undetected in their machinations limits our own capability to respond. In addition HMMLR is believed to have a significant number of former high military personnel in its ranks in addition to regular terrorists, which raises the question of whether they intend more direct action against us some day."

The treaty signed at the end of the war mandates that we limit not only the size of our military but its composition too, with strictly limited numbers of tanks and aircraft and a similarly restricted navy in a grotesque parody of the Treaty of Versailles.

ENG_Lying_In_Ruins:0 "Lying In Ruins"
ENG_Lying_In_Ruins_desc:0 "The German bombing raids were devastating to our economy during the war, and our severance from America and our former colonies has not helped matters, to say nothing of the fact that we no longer hold the British Isles either. There had been signs of recovery before the Germans own economic collapse in the 50's, but at the present time the English economy is even in the most generous of terms, dead in the water. This causes a not insignificant amount of unrest amongst the general public, where unemployment is high and contributes to the volatility of our populace. Should this be fixed however it would be a major relief to our government."

ENG_the_last_battle:0 "The Last Battle"
ENG_the_last_battle_desc:0 "Claude Auchinleck's illustrious military career comes down to this action. His development of HMMLR as the main resistance group of England has been for the sole purpose of destroying the collaborationist regime and placing Elizabeth II upon her rightful throne. If they succeed, they will bask in the glory of having delivered the island from the collab oppressors. If they fail, they will show the world that England still had a few free men of virtue who stood against the disaster that befell the isle."

ENG_who_dares_wins:0 "Who Dares, Wins"
ENG_who_dares_wins_desc:0 "David Stirling and Arthur Harris have ensured that the rebellion's forces will not lack for elite troops and tactical advantages. A bright spot in a group characterized as a ragtag bunch of untrained rebels and paramilitary units, their SAS has been feared by the Germans and collaborators alike for many years. And the recent unveiling of their own air force has certainly caused a great deal of consternation amongst the enemy. They have many other tricks up their sleeves they promise will save England. But their effectiveness remains to be seen..."

ENG_the_left_resistance:0 "The Left Resistance"
ENG_the_left_resistance_desc:0 "Bill Alexander has been fighting for the future from the day he arrived to aid the Republicans in Spain so long ago. He came back to aid his country in the fight for freedom back in the World War. And even in the face of defeat, he still fought on, forming the Left Resistance to free the country. Even catastrophic defeat at Cable Street and exile only left him with a new determination to rid England of fascism. Now, the left forms a united front to relieve the toilers of England of their chains. And they shall not be denied."

ENG_the_legitimate_government_desc:0 "We're the ones with the legitimate king. The elected parliament and prime minister. The unquestioned legal authority over this land for many years. Everything we did was in accordance with the law, and our power has been derived from a line of monarchs going back centuries. We are the true government of England, and we intend to assert that with all the force of the law!"

ENG_promises_of_change:0 "Promises of Change"
ENG_promises_of_change_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling and Harold Macmillan, despite their oftentimes rocky relationship with the rest of the Royal Party, have a handle on how the people are feeling right now, perhaps more so than any other politician. They believe that things have to be drastically changed, but they understand that reform, not revolution, is the best way to accomplish this. They are a voice of reason in these times, and one that many people may latch onto in this era of ideological extremities."

ENG_a_force_of_darkness:0 "A Force of Darkness"
ENG_a_force_of_darkness_desc:0 "Arthur Chesterton is not a man liked by many people. But he is a man devoted to the cause, one which one may never find in the rest of the Royal Party. His unwavering determination and desire to see the rebels crushed aids the government tremendously. And his blackshirts are right behind, as the shock troops of the Kingdom of England. All the Kingdom of England can do is be glad he's on their side."

Military governors with emergency powers are being dispatched across England to coordinate the responses in various localities. England will recover from this disaster, and it will recover stronger and more united than before."

ENG_growing_hunger:0 "The Growing Hunger"
ENG_growing_hunger_desc:0 "Workers are dead or displaced. Fields have been trampled, silos burned, and livestock killed. And the infrastructure of the country has been destroyed or damaged. The result is hungry voices, all over the isle, crying for bread, soup, anything to stave off the hunger. The war is officially over, but if the food supply is not taken care of quickly, a mass starvation in its wake will claim many more lives."

ENG_promising_future:0 "A Promising Future"
ENG_promising_future_desc:0 "The last guns have gone silent. The dust displaced by shelling and munitions has settled to the ground. And now, postwar England has emerged.\n\nAn England damaged and destroyed, yes. But an England no longer constrained by the same chains that once held her in bondage to the German eagle. An England with a future of her own choosing. An England closer to democracy than ever before. An England closer to the bright future, that fabled Jerusalem that will be built in her green and pleasant lands.\n\nAnd we mustn't make a rash mistake and ruin it now."

preECW_HMMLR.1.desc:0 "On a crisp and quiet morning, MP Howard Trobbard put a key in his car ignition to go work in the House of Lords. Not a second later, he was engulfed in a horrific fireball. As our brave London officers descended on the quiet suburb of Bexley, the remants of the attack painted a vile picture. Four people were killed by the massive explosion, including Trobbard's recently hired groundskeeper. Just across the street laid a dark beret with a winged dagger, leaving no questions as to the involvement of the SAS in this evil attack. \n\n Months of heavy crackdowns on the rebels have not halted these disgusting acts of violence, with them becoming so frequent Londoners are beginning to refer to them as "dinner bell bombings." There is no question that we are in a struggle for all that is good and moral on these Isles, and if we do not decisively move to cut off the head of the terrorist snake then the murder of innocent men and women will simply become a fact of life."

preECW_HMMLR.2.desc:0 "As our government struggles to preserve order amidst slackening aid from Germania, the terrorists have grown increasingly bold in their strikes against us. On the outskirts of Brentwood, an armory left lightly defended due to increasing violence in the capital was subject to brutal assault by communist forces. In the dark hours of night, multiple men in red berets shot the few members posted for security with their revolvers, then proceeded to ransack the armory's interior. \n\n As dawn broke and the reds receded to their dank holes, our army was left to survey the damage. As we feared, dozens of assault rifles, rocket launchers, and bulletproof vests were taken, while what couldn't be taken was left heavily damaged by what appeared to be a cluster of pipe bombs. A crude hammer and sickle was spray painted on the armory's rear, leaving us knowing only the vile creed of these bastards. One member of the security detail is now in questioning, stating that he saw the attack occuring from a distance as he'd gone to the hills for...bodily needs. There are no answers here, only a clear need to put out these fires and get our house in order."

ENG_Scotland_unification.1.desc:0 "A group of diplomats walk onto a plane at Heathrow. It leaves the ground early in the morning. In an hour or so, it will be in Edinburgh.\n\nWhen it lands, the negotiations will begin. Negotiations that will determine the fate of the British isle and the people on it. Negotiations that, if successful, will unify Scotland with England once again. Negotiations that may finally allow us to take the mantle of the United Kingdom of old.\n\nThese will be hard. The Scottish will certainly drive the hardest bargain they can. But they will not surrender their freedom for nothing in return. And failure on our part will certainly lead to another massive war on the island. One which will exact a large cost in lives on both sides."
ENG_Scotland_unification.1.a:0 " Let's get them talking..."

ENG_Scotland_unification.2.t:0 "The Arrival Of the English"
ENG_Scotland_unification.2.desc:0 " A delegation has landed at the airport outside of Edinburgh. They are representatives of the English government. Their goal is to reunite the island peacefully, under London's control. But they are willing to give or take a certain bit in return.\n\nNow, we must negotiate with them. To try and get the best deal we can. One that gives our citizens as many rights and privileges as we want. But we must be mindful that refusal to do so could lead to massive war between us and England.\n\nAlternatively...if we believe England is not worth talking to, we could reject this negotiation. Refuse to meet with them. It will certainly lead to a devastating conflict, though. One which our Generals believe we may win, but only with exorbitant cost in lives."
ENG_Scotland_unification.2.a:0 "We don't need to waste our time with them. SCOTLAND FOREVER!"
ENG_Scotland_unification.2.b:0 ""Alright, what can we get in return?"

ENG_Scotland_unification.3.t:0 "Flat-Out Rejected!"
ENG_Scotland_unification.3.desc:0 "The plane returns early. And the people inside are dreading what they must report to London. But it is already common knowledge at this point. And both Scotland and England know it. The negotiations have failed. In fact, they never had begun.\n\nOver the past few days, the diplomats and negotiators sat idle in a hotel in Edinburgh as they tried to get in contact with the Scottish government. But Scotland refused to meet, rejecting the possibility of any deal with England. And thus they had to go home without any hope of a peaceful settlement.\n\nBoth countries are in a panic. Our citizens are panicked over the inevitability of war. Our troops are mobilizing, and so are our enemies. We now have no choice but to win a conflict with our northern neighbor and to do it quickly."
ENG_Scotland_unification.3.a:0 "Now we have to look over our options."

ENG_Scotland_unification.4.t:0 "Doctrinal Debate"
ENG_Scotland_unification.4.desc:0 " "Destruction from within is the best plan," says the Special Forces man. "Scotland has a decent number of people who would be ideologically agreeable with us. We give them some guns, some explosives, and then have them go at it. The nation will crumble in a week."\n\n"I disagree," says the Army man. "The only way anyone wins a war is to straight smash through the enemy lines. We'll have a quick Scottish collapse after that. We only need to prepare ourselves to attack through the mountains."\n\n"An attack must be done, but we're thinking of the wrong place," says the Navy man. "Scapa Flow is their major navy base, and it's in the north. If we take it in a quick operation, we can knock out their most terrifying arm and have a second front on them as well."\n\nThe debate goes on and on. But England must have a plan. So who do we prefer?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.4.a:0 "Special Forces infiltration."
ENG_Scotland_unification.4.b:0 "Frontal Army assault."

ENG_Scotland_unification.5.t:0 "The Resistance Plan"
ENG_Scotland_unification.5.desc:0 "Glad you chose the Special Forces proposal, Prime Minister. Now, let's talk about what we're dealing with.\n\nScotland is known to have groups of UK loyalists and English residents. Many of them have fled after the war, but they've been having problems with the Scottish majority. They're angry, loyal to England, and eager to get back at the government and put London back in control.\n\nSo our plan is, we send them a good number of guns, and explosives. They will then proceed to attack critical areas to cause terror and chaos in Scotland. All the while, they're sending information to us. If you give us the final approval, we can have shipments moving up tonight and recruitment starting tomorrow."
ENG_Scotland_unification.5.a:0 "Let's start messing around up there."

ENG_Scotland_unification.6.t:0 "A House in Shandon"
ENG_Scotland_unification.6.desc:0 "Shandon is a suburb in Edinburgh. The rows of townhomes and narrow streets with thick hedges make it a typical and unassuming place. And for the most part, it actually is. But in one building, something peculiar is going on.\n\nOne of the apartments there has been experiencing some interesting activity as of late. Strange people arriving. It was a trickle at first, but it grows larger every day. Eventually, the owners will set a limit on how many people can come, setting up another location for them to come in. And a background check will reveal the people to all be English, or at least ideologically similar to London.\n\nSometimes, the people who come here are sent to a farm in the countryside. Nobody in the Scottish government knows what goes on there. Or what they are doing. But when they figure out, it will be too late for them to act upon that information."

ENG_Scotland_unification.7.t:0 " Massive Blasts Around Scotland - England Claims Responsibility"
ENG_Scotland_unification.7.desc:0 "Edinburgh (AP) - A sudden wave of terrorist attacks has left a large number of Scots killed or wounded, it was reported. Several targets around Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Inverness were hit, with unconfirmed reports of strikes in isolated places and towns such as Fort William in the Highlands.\n\nThe attacks are confirmed to be the work of various unionist extremist organizations. These groups are primarily made up of disaffected Scotts of English ethnicity, or have political leanings towards a united government with England. Experts say the recent tensions along the border may have played a part in the decision among these groups to strike now. A war with England is believed to be imminent, and these units see themselves as an English "Fifth Column" of sorts.\n\nSurprisingly, the English government has accepted full responsibility for arming and organizing these groups. "We will not apologize for supporting the English in Scotland, nor the ones up there who want a peaceful future together," said a government spokesperson. "The fact is, the Scottish themselves made an action like this inevitable by refusing to negotiate with us. While regrettable, we will not apologize for our actions.""
ENG_Scotland_unification.7.a:0 "Why should we? It worked as intended!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.8.t:0 "The Army Plan"
ENG_Scotland_unification.8.desc:0 "Alright, Prime Minister. I'm glad you have seen the sense of a good old-fashioned frontal assault. Let's go over the plans.\n\nOur greatest chance at victory comes with a breakthrough in the border regions. If we get through, the Scots will fall, and we'll be in Edinburgh within the fortnight. That's how it's worked in every battle ever. One side gets through, and they wipe out the other. And we expect this war to be no different.\n\nFirst, our task is preparing our forces for the job. We can put together a unit of mountain troops for the job. Mostly loyalists from Scotland. Their job is to break through. Once they're set up, we'll launch a border war to see if the Scots are up to task. If they aren't, we're going to do what Hitler couldn't and finally break their lines."
ENG_Scotland_unification.8.a:0 "Let's get ready, then."

ENG_Scotland_unification.9.t:0 "The 52nd Lowlanders"
ENG_Scotland_unification.9.desc:0 "In the North Pennines, a special unit gathers. Men from Scotland, disaffected by the recent political trends in the country. Men familiar with the terrain of the country. Men skilled in mountain warfare.\n\nThe 52nd Lowlanders is the title of this new unit. It's name is a joke, referencing the 51st Highlanders, the premier division of the Scottish military. Only this time they are working for the English. And they are prepared to test their skill with their more famous rival."
ENG_Scotland_unification.9.a:0 "They will get that opportunity."

ENG_Scotland_unification.10.t:0 "Look Before You Leap"
ENG_Scotland_unification.10.desc:0 "Prime Minister, everything is set up. The 52nd is ready, and our forces are deployed at the border. We're now facing off against Scotland, and they're not blinking. And war will break off any day now. It's time for a little test.\n\nIn a certain area of the border, there's an area where the fencing is not clearly marked. We will attack a Scottish patrol there when it comes around. It will be backed up with artillery and massive divisional support. It's vague enough that nobody can quite blame us, and it will allow us to actually test the Scottish defences before we have to move in. Of course, the downside is that it actually starts a war, but we expected it at this point."
ENG_Scotland_unification.10.a:0 "Let's hope they're lacking."

ENG_Scotland_unification.11.t:0 "Scapa Flow"
ENG_Scotland_unification.11.desc:0 " Since Haakon IV of Norway anchored there in 1263, Scapa Flow, in the Orkneys, has been favored as a safe and convenient place to park one's fleet. It's strategic location to block the North Sea was noticed by the Royal Navy in 1905, and it thus became the location of the Home Fleet. Perhaps the most famous event at the location was the mass scuttling of German warships after the First World War. It's distance from German airfields again made it a prime location to base the Royal Navy when the second one broke out.\n\nToday, it's the prime naval base for Scotland. Their Gibraltar, so to speak. The central lynchpin of their defense. From there, they can block the North Sea and clear their coasts with ease. It is the point from which their entire armed forces is based around."
ENG_Scotland_unification.11.a:0 "And we're going to knock it out."

ENG_Scotland_unification.12.t:0 "Friends From Within"
ENG_Scotland_unification.12.desc:0 "We are not without our friends in Scotland. There are plenty of people of English ancestry up there, who wish to reunite with their homeland once again. And some Scotts are still unionists. These forces help us gather intelligence about various Scottish deployments and other information. Some of it involving Scapa Flow has proven especially interesting.\n\nThe Scottish Navy typically runs exercises in the day. However, at night, they are based in the harbor. An attack on them will yield devastating consequences at that time. We could be able to destroy or damage a great amount of their fleet before they could do anything. And the garrison on the islands is so weak, we could take it without too much trouble."
ENG_Scotland_unification.12.a:0 "Let's go, then."

ENG_Scotland_unification.13.t:0 "Zero Hour"
ENG_Scotland_unification.13.desc:0 "At 1:15 AM, the islands were awakened.\n\nThe English navy, coming in from the east, opened up with a massive barrage of anti-ship missiles and aircraft. The Scottish Fleet was caught completely unaware at the port. Many ships were hit in the initial barrage. Those that tried to escape found English submarines outside, waiting for them. When the English closed the gap, they were able to add their cannons to the fight.\n\nAt the same time, on the north of the island, English marines and special forces landed at Inganess Bay, with the objective of seizing the airport there. More forces landed at the Bay of Berstane and the Bay of Meil, pushing into the town of Kirkwall. The garrison there was completely overwhelmed, forced to retreat to the town center to put up a stand around the police station.\n\nAs day rose, and more forces were airlifted in from Newcastle, it was obvious how the night had gone. The Scottish had been defeated. The English flag once again flew over Scapa Flow and the Orkneys.\n\nAnd a new war on the isle had begun."
ENG_Scotland_unification.13.a:0 "We're in it now."

ENG_Scotland_unification.14.t:0 "The Anglo_Scottish War"
ENG_Scotland_unification.14.desc:0 "The entire island is consumed by sirens. From Wick to Dover, civilians crowd into air-raid shelters, fearful of enemy air attacks. Children are being taught to use gas masks, and sent away to the countryside. Homeowners are told to set up shelters in the bottom of their homes to escape the enemy air attacks. Those especially close to the front lines are begged to stay in place, least they clog the roads for fighting men.\n\nThe border regions, so long a scene of tense, yet quiet, tranquility is now rattled by the sounds of machine guns and artillery fire. Scottish and English cannons attempt to hit the other side, while thousands of guns cover the ground, mowing down anyone who dares cross the lines or poke his head up. In an instant, the piece of British countryside has turned into Verdun.\n\nWas this avoidable? Could this have been prevented with some sensible decisions? Likely. But common sense has not prevailed. And now the isle has been embroiled in yet another bloody war.\n\nWe may only pray that we emerge victorious."
ENG_Scotland_unification.14.a:0 "God save England!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.15.t:0 "The Talks Begin"
ENG_Scotland_unification.15.desc:0 "In Edinburgh, a room is full of people. On one side sits a group of English diplomats. On the other, officials of the Scottish government. They look at eachother, sizing each other up. They have to. Things are just too important to not pay attention.\n\nThe negotiations for the future of Scotland have begun. Will Scotland enter England as an equal partner? Will the original arrangement with Scotland in the Act of Union be maintained? Or will something in-between be agreed to? It remains to be seen. But one thing is for certain: if negotiations fail here, a war will surely break out between the two nations."
ENG_Scotland_unification.15.a:0 "Let's do this."

ENG_Scotland_unification.16.t:0 "Our Opening Offer"
ENG_Scotland_unification.16.desc:0 "Let's start with an opening proposal. Now, the ideal situation is we end up where Scotland was under the Act of Union. Obviously, that would be more than acceptable to us, and is something reasonable we can ask for. We couldn't give the Scots a worse deal than they once had, they would reject it outright anyway.\n\nOf course, they probably won't like this one either. They will, in all likelihood, ask for something a bit better on their end. We should be prepared to receive this notice, and think about our next steps. But you aren't just going to annex an independent nation without giving them some autonomy in return. This isn't the 1930s."
ENG_Scotland_unification.16.a:0 "You have to start with something."

ENG_Scotland_unification.17.t:0 "The Original Union"
ENG_Scotland_unification.17.desc:0 "\"So here's our proposal,\" says the English negotiator. \"You can come in under the Acts of Union from 1707. Your laws can remain the same, your parliament still exists. And you get representation in London. That's a good deal, right? Especially considering the bloody Germans are off the island.\n\nLook, we're doing you a favor. We could press for worse, but we won't. We respect your independence, and we're not trying to just march over you and do to you what the Germans did to the Czechs. So we're offering a chance to make the deal your ancestors did and get together with no issues whatsoever. It worked well for them, didn't it?\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.17.a:0 "I guess that's good."
ENG_Scotland_unification.17.b:0 "How about we be a real Union of Equals instead?"

ENG_Scotland_unification.18.t:0 "They Went For It!"
ENG_Scotland_unification.18.desc:0 "Jubilation went through the streets of London as word got out of the deal that had been reached with Scotland. They had agreed to the same Acts of Union they had signed in 1707, no more, no less.\n\nThe people cheered when the PM came out to make the announcement. Without a doubt, it was a major victory for the government, and all of England. Scotland was back. And England could now call itself Britain once again, and with all honesty."
ENG_Scotland_unification.18.a:0 "Same as it ever was!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.19.t:0 "Counter-offer"
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.desc:0 "\"Do you mean to insult me?\" asks the Scottish negotiator. \"Nobody is going to agree to become a puppet of London up here. Not after we've had freedom for so long. We want more than just the status quo. Far more.\n\nWe'll keep our own parliament, and our own elections. English laws stop at the border as well, we'll take care of our own business. Taxation will be left up to us. And massive protections for our language must be left in as well. You want a Union, then it's going to have to be a Union of Equals.\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.a:0 " Okay, that's fine..."
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.b:0 "How about a Scottish Council instead?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.19.c:0 "You can have some limited autonomy."

ENG_Scotland_unification.20.t:0 "Proposal Accepted!"
ENG_Scotland_unification.20.desc:0 "The English had no choice but to accept our demands. Every single one. And that is the best possible outcome we could have gotten out of the situation.\n\nScotland will join England, yes. But it will join England with an enormous degree of autonomy. We have complete control over our domestic affairs and laws. We can do what we want, and London's authority stops at the border. Scotland will be ruled by its people forevermore, and nothing in England can prevent this.\n\nSome may mourn the nominal loss of independence. But there's nothing that really makes it a terrible issue for us. We have control over our affairs. We can have our democratic system maintained. Scotland's people are truly free and will be forevermore.\n\nWith this deal, we guarantee a free Scotland with London's respect."
ENG_Scotland_unification.20.a:0 "We won."

ENG_Scotland_unification.21.t:0 "Why Do I Cry On My Wedding Day?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.21.desc:0 "Scotland is ours again. That's the important part. So why does it feel that nobody's celebrating?\n\nThey have full control over all domestic matters. They exacted a heavy toll from England to join up. And they still have their own government. All things that make the deal seem more like a giveaway rather than a deal between two equal partners.\n\nScotland is a part of England now. Britain has been reformed.\n\nBut England had to bend the knee to them for it to happen."
ENG_Scotland_unification.21.a:0 "We still have control, don't we?"

ENG_Scotland_unification.22.t:0 "The Scottish Council"
ENG_Scotland_unification.22.desc:0 "\"No, we're not going to give you complete autonomy,\" says the English negotiator. \"Are you serious? Nothing would get done! And how could we be a union if neither of us can have a final say? Have you seen Iberia?\n\nWe'll give you something close to that, though. You can have a Scottish Council. You elect the people you want to the council, and they can make decisions. If there's something minor that we have that doesn't work up here, you can change it. But certain major things get decided in London. And, yes, you still have representation in London.\n\nIt's really the best of both worlds. You get to make your own decisions, and we get to have somebody with the final say if things get heated. You really aren't going to do any better than that, can you?\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.22.a:0 "Sounds good, let's do it."
ENG_Scotland_unification.22.b:0 "We need more."

ENG_Scotland_unification.23.t:0 "Equal Exchange"
ENG_Scotland_unification.23.desc:0 "Two things are happening today. Both in Edinburgh. And both at the same time.\n\nAt the Redford Cavalry and Infantry Barracks, a group of 51st Highlanders stand outside, looking at a flagpole. A group of press and onlookers are standing outside the Scottish Government Building as well, looking at two flagpoles instead. One has nothing flying, while the one to the left has Saint Andrew's Cross.\n\nWhile an army band plays the Scottish National Anthem, the Scottish flag at Redford is taken down. The soldiers look on in silence. Some cry. Others keep a stern face throughout. Then, the band strikes a new tune. And another flag is raised up the pole.\n\nAt the same time, the same song is played in front of the Scottish Government Building. And the same flag is being hoisted. The emotions are a lot less subdued here. Some cry, while others cheer.It is a sad event, but there is a silver lining to it.\n\nThe song is the English National Anthem. The Flag is the one of a united isle. And at the end of the song, the flag is flying all the way up. England has gained control over the Scottish military. And Scotland has its own council."
ENG_Scotland_unification.23.a:0 "Jolly good!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.24.t:0 "In my defence..."
ENG_Scotland_unification.24.desc:0 "\"A council would work,\" says the Scottish negotiator. \"That's acceptable. But there's a problem. How would we defend ourselves?\n\nScotland is in a unique situation. One which requires a degree of military force. We have been in occasional tense situations with the Kriegsmarine in the North Sea. It's not out of the possibility that they may seek to invade us. And where would we be if all the forces are in the south? We need our own militia to defend ourselves with.\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.24.a:0 " Alright, you can have that, I guess."
ENG_Scotland_unification.24.b:0 " No, you have to accept the offer we gave you, or else!"

ENG_Scotland_unification.25.t:0 "As good as we got"
ENG_Scotland_unification.25.desc:0 "We fought for everything we could. We demanded everything. But they refused to budge on certain things. And at the end of the day, nobody wanted a war.\n\nThe deal with England isn't the best we could have gotten. There are certain things we had to give up. But it isn't the worst deal we could have gotten, either. We still have things that help guarantee a better future for the people of Scotland.\n\nAt the end of the day, we forced the English to negotiate with us as equals. Even if we are now in a Union once again, we held strong and forced them to compromise. And perhaps that will be our finest legacy, after years of hatred between us."
ENG_Scotland_unification.25.a:0 "We drove the hardest we could."

ENG_Scotland_unification.26.t:0 "We Won, Didn't We?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.26.desc:0 "Yes, we did. But was it worth the cost?\n\nScotland is part of England. We can form something like the UK again. And that should be an accomplishment. But for many people, the way we went about it makes it feel like a bit of a capitulation.\n\nScotland is ours. But it has a high degree of autonomy. So much so that one wonders if it was really worth it. Worth it to surrender English pride and honor for this deal.\n\nBut it's not the worst deal. Or the worst outcome. We avoided a war, and have united peacefully. And hopefully they judge us on that in the future instead."
ENG_Scotland_unification.26.a:0 "We still have something."

ENG_Scotland_unification.27.t:0 "Final Warning"
ENG_Scotland_unification.27.desc:0 "\"No, that's just not acceptable!\" declares an angry English negotiator. \"We will not compromise on these terms, and that's final. You have to agree to them. London will not accept anything more.\n\nIf you don't agree, these negotiations will fall apart, and we have to have a war. What you're proposing is completely unacceptable as a solution to this crisis. We've come this far, and you need to agree with us. Or another war erupts on this blood-soaked isle.\n\nYou have to back down. To do otherwise is going to mean a war that nobody wants. And you know that we've got the larger military and the industrial base. You will lose this conflict. And there's going to be a deal not as generous as one we're giving you.\n\nIn the name of God, think of your people! Do you want to lead them into a massive, unwinnable war? Or do you want to just accept a deal you have some reservations about? Plase, take the sensible option and sign the treaty!\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.27.a:0 "Guess they're serious about this."
ENG_Scotland_unification.27.b:0 "We'll see how well you can attack us."

ENG_Scotland_unification.28.t:0 "Talk is cheap"
ENG_Scotland_unification.28.desc:0 "Scotland refused to discuss any more terms. There were attempts to get them to agree. There were attempts to get them at least discussing the terms again. There were attempts to get everyone to at least stay in the same room. They all failed. And everyone knew what must come next.\n\nPanic spread across the island. Civilians prepared to flee the border regions. The soldiers mobilized and prepared to fight. And in Edinburgh and London, politicians and generals both looked at the same map with foreboding and dread.\n\nAnother war in Britain had begun. And for the first time in the modern era, it would be between Scotland and Enlgand."
ENG_Scotland_unification.28.a:0 "And we all suffer for it."

ENG_Scotland_unification.29.t:0 "A better deal?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.29.desc:0 "\"No, no, no,\" says the English negotiator. \"We can't do that. That's too much to ask. Complete autonomy? Are you out of your minds? How would we get anything done?\n\nObviously, we know that the old Acts of Union were going to be a hard sell for you. So we have another offer. We can give your parliament some more control and autonomy. You can set more tax rates, and have some laws that England doesn't, except in major fields like narcotics enforcement. And you can also have a few protections for your language.\n\nIf that's good, we can shake hands and leave right now. But if it's not, I'll have to ask London again. And they may not be so eager to give you much more.\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.29.a:0 "Alright"
ENG_Scotland_unification.29.b:0 "We would like a Scottish Council instead."

ENG_Scotland_unification.30.t:0 "That Worked?"
ENG_Scotland_unification.30.desc:0 "The English negotiator stared at the paper that had been dropped in front of him. He was amazed, it seems that the Scots had accepted the proposal. Limited Autonomy had been accepted by the Scottish delegation. The English negotiator was pleasantly surprised. However, to some of the other delegates, this was quite a large item to be given up to the Scots. Them having some autonomy means they could impede their own laws and possibly challenge the laws that the English had laid down for them.\n\nAcross Scotland, these changes had begun to be felt immediately. Members of Scottish Parliament had been told to prepare to be moved to the English Parliament immediately, as the change was effective. However, now across the isles, another flag was raised next to the Cross of St. George, the Cross of St. Andrews. It was only due process. As the negotiator nodded his head, he wondered if the transition would be kind to the many people of Britain. "
ENG_Scotland_unification.30.a:0 "Aparently"

ENG_Scotland_unification.31.t:0 "One Last Try"
ENG_Scotland_unification.31.desc:0 "\"We want our Scottish Council, full stop. Either we receive the council, or Scotland does not join the Union. Simple as that. If we join the Union, we only want a council for us to self govern.\" Said the Scottish negotiator to a English negotiator who had sat across from him at the table.\n\nThe English negotiator seemed even more annoyed and replied, more annoyed than anything at the fact he now had to deal with the idea of a Scottish Council running around. If they had let the Scottish join and stand down, it could be a massive blow for the country. Letting a country in with such high autonomy? This could be a disaster for the public! However, the idea of a Scottish Council could lessen tensions between the two countries. He then replied to the Scot, hoping he could persuade the man."
ENG_Scotland_unification.31.a:0 "\"We accept your proposal.\""
ENG_Scotland_unification.31.b:0 "\"We decline, final warning\""

ENG_Scotland_unification.32.t:0 "Fine, We Accept"
ENG_Scotland_unification.32.desc:0 "The English negotiator crossed the floor to meet with the Scottish negotiator, once there they shook hands, like they did at the start of the meetings. Each one had a bit of respect for the other. It took lots of dedication to come and meet a foreign representative face to face and demand things. Each of them did that. They shared a few words before both departed. The Scots flew home, uncertain of what would occur in the coming weeks, but confident that they had proposed the right idea. They were also certain that they had done the right thing for Scotland, a council would definitely help. The English did the same, they flew back to London, hoping that they had made the right agreement. War could have been an option, but who would want that. Only death and destruction followed. However, for both parties, they looked into the future with hope."
ENG_Scotland_unification.32.a:0 "An Isle Reunited"

ENG_Scotland_unification.33.t:0 "The Decision"
ENG_Scotland_unification.33.desc:0 "The Scottish President looked down at their fingers. In front of them was the cabinet and some members of the armed forces who had met with the president to discuss the issue of war with the English. The English had come down to their last line, patience had basically gone with them. It seems that the demands that the Scots had brought to the table had been too radical for the English.\n\nThe Scottish at this point only had two options. Either they would bow to the English or prepare for a conflict that would devastate Britain for years to come. The Scottish President then announced their decision to the group assembled before him, it would then be sent to Holyrood."

POLITICS_ALEC_DOUGLAS_HOME_DESC:0 "Alexander Douglas-Home was not a man born into any true power. He served in the Territorial Army to no great success, married his wife Elizabeth in a ceremony of little note, and served as a Member of Parliament with little influence before leaving in 1937 to be the aide of Neville Chamberlain. Though initially serving as Chamberlain's eye in the House, after he left the Government Home was caught up in bigger problems. He spent most of 1940-1943 in a full cast for the spinal tuberculosis he had removed. Thus Home missed much of the bungling of the Unity Government in the war effort - along with much of the blame, something which proved useful when the Germans invaded.\n\nHome was present at the signing of the peace treaty that dissolved the United Kingdom by virtue of inheriting his father's lordship in 1942, but held little influence in English affairs for the remainder of the decade. The 1950's however proved more favourable, with Home emerging as perhaps the archetypical representative of the Royal Establishment, desiring above all else to prevent a second invasion. The Royal Party is de facto an alliance of several groups, and as one PM after another fell to infighting, riots or German disagreement, Home simply kept rising: first to leader of the House of Lords, and then to Foreign Minister under Mountbatten. Finally, following the brief leaderless year of 1958, Home was convinced to take the post of Prime Minister.\n\nHome's government has been a relatively stable one compared to his predecessors. He has managed to solidify the Royal Party, and is tolerated if not exactly liked by the Garrison in Cornwall. Now however, with the rising influence of HMMLR, Home faces far more perilous straits, and whether he shall lead his nation into survival or damnation remains to be seen."
POLITICS_HENRY_HEAVENLY_DESC:0 "Heinrich HMMLR is the dutiful leader of the Bur- ...the Burnley Resistance Brigade, a brave and completely English partisan organization which is absolutely real and exists on the historical record. Born in Munich (an Anglicization of Mhunecagh, a small town in West... Shire... town. Yes, West Shiretown.), his upbringing in such an isolated village led to him to develop an unusual backcountry accent. Why does it sound German, do you ask? That's because he's more Anglo-Saxon (emphasis on the "Saxon" part) than the rest.\n\nIn order to keep anyone, even other members of the resistance curious about his heritage, from finding out his identity and threatening all the friends and family he claims to have, he has foregone his true name and adopted the acronym of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance as a nom de guerre. Any similarity to the name of a famous, intelligent, and ravishingly handsome Reichsführer-SS is purely coincidental. Upon being asked, Heinrich HMMLR will insist that he has in fact been seen in the same room as Heinrich Himmler many times and that he has a photograph of them together, but he happened to leave it in his other wallet that day.\n\nHMMLR's plans upon victory include transferring the entire monetary reserve to a secure undisclosed location, bringing in large groups of foreign experts to train the officer corps, providing grants to study the atomic sciences at Oxford and Cambridge, and constructing a second metro system in London far deeper than the first. As to where the money will go, where the experts will come from, who will provide the grants, and what he plans to put in the tunnels, HMMLR has been eerily silent, his gaze boring into the very souls of anyone who asks."
POLITICS_HAROLD_MACMILLAN_DESC:0 "Some men would fight for their country until time itself bowed to their whim. For each ditch, for each farm and field they would fight under their lands were nought but cinder and bone. Harold Macmillan, born in 1894 in the age of Queen Victoria, serving in the Great War and seeing Britain triumphant, might seem like the kind of man to whom this would apply, but the Second World War broke many things. The British spirit foremost amongst them. Seeing his nation bombed into ruin, its youth dead on foreign shores and even London itself falling under the yoke of the Reich, Macmillan was struck with the realisation that he could well be witnessing the utter destruction of all that he had loved and held dear. So unlike many brave men, Harold Macmillan signed the treaty of surrender to preserve not his nation's glory, but its people.\n\nDespite this, as he knew too well, an unwillingness to see your nation ruined further does not mean you stop hating those who ruined it. The reformist faction of the Royal Party was formed by Macmillan to be the face of reluctant acquiescence in the Collaborationist government, but also to provided a legal haven for those opposed to fascist dictatorship. He later backed the creation of the United England Party to ensure the fascists and the corrupt oligarchs of the Royal Party never get a chance to bring England to ruin again.\n\nMost of the English people don't know who Macmillan is, most will never know who he is. He is not a man for speeches or publicity, he has people for that. Some see him as a tyrant in the making, but these people fail to see his true cause. Whilst Harold Macmillan lives, he will keep England from ever seeing its men die on foreign shores again."
POLITICS_REGINALD_MAUDLING_DESC:0 "Reginald Maudling is an easy man for many to despise. One whose career oftentimes depended on the protection and mercy of Harold Macmillan. His decision to stay with the government while many of his ideological comrades ran off to join Claude's futile crusade will forever cast a cloud over him. And his betrayal of many in United England in his powergrab could easily leave one to condemn him as a man without honor.\n\nBut this assessment must also reconcile with the fact that Maudling was one of the few tireless crusaders for liberty in the English government. The one who would speak truth to Douglas-Home's face when nobody else could. The man whose leadership of United England broke the Royal Party and halted Chesterton. And the Prime Minister who finally delivered with all his efforts what so many for so long had wished for; a democratic England.\n\nMaudling's England is a free England, at last. One where the worker may not fear the boss. The weak do not fear the mighty. And every man and woman is equal in the eyes of the law. Maudling's England is an enlightened England guided by liberal ideals like the one of old. And Maudling's England is the future."
POLITICS_MARGARET_THATCHER_DESC:0 "What is the making of a great leader? Is it the ability to compromise? To crush all opposition or ensure it never forms in the first place? The answer Margaret Thatcher would give is a simple one. What makes a leader is an iron will to do what is needed, and the courage to see it through until the end..\n\nPeople said a grocer's daughter and chemist couldn't possibly stand against a respected independent candidate in the 1951 by-election and win, yet Thatcher did so. Her own colleagues were certain she was nothing but a minor blip on the radar, no need to worry about her becoming a well known face. Then in poll after poll Mrs Thatcher emerged as one of the most popular Royal Party politicians in England for her efforts to champion the cause of the ordinary citizen. In the aftermath of the English Civil War, and the resignation of PM Alec Douglas-Home, nobody whatsoever thought a woman with no solid power base could be anything more than a puppet of the party leadership, Prime Minister or not.\n\nIt will be interesting to see about that one.\n\nMargaret has a dream, of a strong and independent England answering to neither Germania nor Washington, of a people no longer cowed by intimidation but loyal to the government out of gratitude. Margaret Thatcher will move mountains to see England prevail, whether the world is set against her or not. For she knows that one misstep could well mean her doom."
POLITICS_REG_BIRCH_DESC:0 "One would not think an engineer could inspire so much fear in an organisation filled with terrorists, soldiers and desperate men. But there was a reason everybody in HMMLR feared Reg Birch. Originally merely a mid ranking CPGB official who escaped the London Uprising by the skin of his teeth, Reg Birch kept the movement going whilst men like Bill Alexander went into exile, even if only for a short while. Joining up with the Left Resistance upon the Red General's return in 1958, Birch proved his utility when he provided the names of every mole in the movement seemingly out of nowhere. For that was his strength, information.\n\nIn England the reach of Reg Birch was second to none, thanks to his infiltration of the Collaborationist intelligence apparatus and a network of trade union contacts spread around the nation. These helped contribute to the victory of HMMLR in the Civil War, but the Socialist Labour Party formed in its aftermath was too moderate for Birch, too revisionary and prone to indulging the excesses of the Labour Aristocracy.\n\nSo like any good gardener finding a weed, he pruned it. Under Chairman Birch the Socialist Labour Party has turned down a more radical path, one of ideological purity and vengeance wreaked upon monarchists, collaborationists and revisionists alike. Let the world gaze on as England fortifies itself into a nation of concrete and will, whilst the revolutionary flag flies ever higher. Chairman Birch will guide England into the future, he will stop the fascist dogs in Germania from ever setting foot upon his isle, and most of all he will save England from its worst enemy, itself."
POLITICS_CLAUDE_AUCHINLECK_DESC:0 "Patience is a virtue. Nobody remembers the man who strikes and fails, nobody remembers because he dies ignominiously and without note. Claude Auchinleck was forced to internalize this lesson during his last stand at Carlisle, holding with a few thousand militia and what scattered infantry he could scrape together whilst the rest of the British generalship either fled or surrendered. He realised in that shelled out surrounded city that if he died there nothing would be gained, and all hope for Britain might be lost.\n\nSo he surrendered, pretended to find an aptitude for politics and joined the Royal Party as an MP, loyally supporting the new government. All the while, he began creating the most organised rebel group that England had ever seen. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, an alliance that despite its name was dedicated solely to the expulsion of the German occupier and their Collaborationist puppets from England, free elections and the restoration of democracy at all costs.\n\nUnlike many early groups, HMMLR made no distinction in ideology other than an opposition to fascism and recruited any and all willing to join the cause. The half communist Left Resistance and Bill Alexander, the ultra-militant Commando's of David Stirling and a dozen other notorious bands of outlaws and freedom fighters swore loyalty to Auchinleck, \"The Boss\". And whilst the shadow head of HMMLR was hunted far and wide, nobody suspected the mild MP from Newcastle who was well past 70 years old.\n\nBut now HMMLR's time has come, they rise in a rebellion to overthrow the government and Auchinleck stands revealed to the world as their leader. Come death of glory, his shall be a tale remembered forever."
POLITICS_GEORGE_JELLICOE_DESC:0 "George Jellicoe might have a military background, but the once daring commando who terrorised the Italian forces in the Mediteranean looks quite different nowadays. Forced to capitulate following his capture in the earliest days of Operation Sealion, Jellicoe pretended to be willing to let go of his loyalty to King George and was released into a well respected civil service position at the Foreign Office. In secret, however, the son of the Admiral in Command at Jutland never fully surrendered.\n\nIn his position at the Foreign Office Jellicoe was approached by the agents of Claude Auchinleck, and swiftly rose to become one of the main contacts between the OFN and Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. Following the victory of HMMLR forces in the English Civil War, Auchinleck was faced with the problem of his own advanced age and not wanting to set a military precedent for leadership in the new civilian government. As a result he nominated someone he could trust to head the National Democratic League at the first democratic elections in twenty years.\n\nA man dedicated to his Queen, his country and his party, Jellicoe plans to turn England into something resembling its former glory, but whether he can do this whilst keeping his American friends happy remains to be seen. For in the end, despite their different origins, Jellicoe is respected by Enoch Powell and Norman St John-Stevas enough to maintain his position as Prime Minister, but whether he turns the National Democratic League into a party in its own right, and earns the trust Auchinleck placed in him, remains to be seen."
POLITICS_HAROLD_WILSON_DESC:0 "The argument exists that socialism and democracy are somehow incompatible. That the working man cannot earn the just reward for all that he toils and have a vote for the government at the same time. Harold Wilson will prove those allegations wrong, his leadership of the Socialist Labour Party depends on it after all.\n\nNothing more than a minor civil servicemen during the War, Wilson watched as his nation collapsed around him and could do nothing. He watched as the Labour party he had joined was forced underground and once his own ties were revealed himself along with it, and he could do nothing. But inch by inch, he started taking things into his own hands, advocating for a broader coalition to the exiled leadership in Ottawa and even trying to persuade the Labour Underground to join the CPGB in their ill fated London Uprising. Eventually he was able to claim the leadership of the movement for himself following a brutal crackdown by the Collaborationist authorities, just in time for Bill Alexander to return from his exile in Russia.\n\nIn a cold cellar the two men talked, one leading the largest leftist militant network still intact following the crackdown, inspired with a newly found willingness to compromise, the other an Oxford graduate and administrator determined to see England freed. It says something about Wilson that he handed the leadership of the Left Resistance to Bill Alexander from the start. Perhaps that was why, when searching for a candidate to spearhead the Socialist Labour Party's first electoral campaign, he looked no further than Wilson. Now contending with a fractious party of Social Democrats, Communists and more, Harold Wilson will finally be able to do something all the world will see."
POLITICS_RAB_BUTLER_DESC:0 "He had been right all along. When the Germans invaded the Isles, Richard Austen Butler was proven to have been right when he said that the Germans ought to have been appeased and that Britain should have stayed well out of Continental affairs. And all being right cost him was watching the British Empire collapse around his former colleagues’ feet.\n\nButler's position on Germany left him well placed to become one of the foremost members of the burgeoning Royal Party. Once the initial lot of outright fascists were sidelined or dealt with, in one way or another, it was left to Butler and others like him to transform the Royal Party into something which would keep England stable, safe and, most importantly, alive. He used his connections to help get the aristocracy broadly on board with the Royal Party programme, and it got to the point where his words were listened to more closely than those of the Prime Minister.\n\nYet now Rab Butler finds himself in power, and he has found that the limelight does not suit him much. His appeal to the ordinary citizen was always somewhat less than his appeal to the upper classes, after all. But he will carry on. For if he does not, England may face the fate it endured in 1943 once again."
POLITICS_YDL_PROVISIONAL_GOVERNMENT_DESC:0 "The Young Democracy Law was never intended to be activated. Crafted by Bill Alexander and Claude Auchinleck, it was designed so that, in case of great crisis or crass incompetence, a selection of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance leaders could take temporary power. The only situation where one expected it to be necessary, of course, was a decapitation strike on the government or an elected government considering surrender to Germany.\n\nYet, for one reason or another, the government elected by the people, of the people, and for the people has failed to deliver, collapsing into anarchy. As such the Young Democracy Law has been activated, so that a caretaker government can see the country through to new elections. The administration is not divided amongst petty partisan lines of right or left, but will act as a government of unity for all Englishmen.\n\nThe people don't seem to mind this provisional government much, but whether this remains the case in the long term remains to be seen. The elections have not manifested thus far, after all."
POLITICS_REGINALD_MAUDLING_DESC:0 "Reginald Maudling is not a man of great cunning. Luck he certainly possesses in spades, for how many times can you insult the Germans and the Government of which you form part - in public no less - without suffering any consequences? The truth of the matter was somewhat less fortuitous than many would believe. Maudling and his eclectic collection of Liberals, outcasts and downright malcontents were protected by Macmillan not because they were useful to him at the time, but because they were amongst the only MP's Macmillan could trust to return to democracy if the opportunity were offered.\n\nMaudling would not get his chance until the dissolution of the Royal Party and the resignation of PM Alec Douglas-Home, opening up an opportunity for Macmillan's reformists to seek their own path. Yet conversely, the man most dedicated to the protection of English democracy could not be seen to lead it, associated so intrinsically with the Royal Party as Macmillan was. How could people believe change would come from his leadership? Enter Maudling, stage right.\n\nActing as Macmillan's public face for the newly formed United England movement, Reginald Maudling proved not just a match for the trails he faced, but their better as well. Convincing even his most ardent detractors wrong, under his leadership England will have the chance to know true democracy once more. Maudling sacrificed much for this opportunity, to have idealism triumph over pragmatism, and for this he will most certainly make his mark on history."
POLITICS_DAVID_STIRLING_DESC:0 "There is no man in the British Isles who fought longer than David Stirling. Deserting from the surrendering British forces in the Midlands at the end of the Second World War, Stirling is noteworthy for leading the only resistance group to conduct warfare from the start of Royal Party rule to its end. Now in the political scene, the man who planned and executed much of HMMLR's strategy turns that mind to less violent pursuits, though some might argue the stakes are even higher. For a Perthshire lad it's not a bad rise, and to do so over the corpses of Germans makes it all the better."
POLITICS_BERNARD_MONTGOMERY_DESC:0 "When Britain splintered under the iron boots of the Wehrmacht, Bernard Montgomery did his duty by serving the collaborationists and keeping the nation together, protecting it from the extremes of Germany's wrath. Once more he has answered the call of duty in the name of England. With a stiff upper lip and a firm hand, Field Marshal Montgomery has established himself as ruler of the Southern Temporary Military District. When his work is done, only then will England return to normality."
POLITICS_GERALD_TEMPLER_DESC:0 "Like many brave soldiers, Gerald Templer fought in the trenches of France during the First World War. Like many brave soldiers, Gerald Templer defended his nation with vigor and tenacity during the Second World War. Like many brave soldiers, Gerald Templer sacrificed his pride for England's security by siding with the collaborationists following its tragic defeat. For the Field Marshal, this is no time for cowardice. Montgomery's Coup has split England into two Temporary Military Districts, with Templer ruling over the north for as long as necessary."
POLITICS_AK_Chesterton_DESC:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is a man of many layers. A scarred veteran of the trenches of the Great War, a theatre critic, an alcoholic. A fabian in past times, a fascist now. Though he left the sinking ship that was Mosley's BUF at the first opportunity, Chesterton was reinforced in his beliefs as the Axis stormed into Egypt, while the British army in East Africa he was part of was stuck sieging the mountains of Amba Alagi.\n\nBy the time the siege was lifted by Axis reinforcements from the north, Chesterton had already been sent back home to fight off the Germans, despite his poor health. With Britain's situation graver than ever, Chesterton decided not to evacuate from the German advance and gathered anyone willing he could find to prepare for a new Britain. One strengthened by Fascism, not opposed to it.\n\nIt was for that purpose that he would rally the Hardliner faction of the Royalist party around him, and now the National Front. And he's finally done it, hasn't he? He rules over England after all...\n\nBut Chesterton is a man long past his prime, his party full of division and sub-factions. Only time will tell if he can truly implement his vision of a fascist Isle, or be swept away by the Nazi bootlickers he calls allies."

Heavily armed representatives.

Regardless of some of our fellows' opinions on the matter of furthering or lessening ties to our benefactors across the Channel, our first priority must be the continued survival of England above all else.\n\nThe King may think he can calm the recent tensions with a speech and a proud word, but we know better. These tensions represent an existential threat to our nation's survival. Let us instead use this opportunity to secure the government's position, and point out that we do not have the capacity to fight Germany, no matter what the would-be rebels say."
ENG_anyone_anything_desc:0 "One might suppose that people ought to be grateful for the government signing a peace deal that ended the war, but those who remember when it was Britain, and not England, think differently. Of course it isn't the job of the policeman to criticize the government's choices but perhaps a more secure method of informing the people that everything is fine could have been used? As in, not a speech by the king to thousands of people?\n\nNever mind the risk to His Majesty, but the arrest quotas are simply getting ridiculous. How on earth are the police supposed to hold half the former protesters in London for a couple of weeks before the event, not to mention the proposals about blocking off Cable Street? With no extra manpower to cover it? Still, it's the policeman's job to obey orders, not make them. Hopefully the speech will actually calm down the rabble somewhat."
ENG_what_to_say_desc:0 "What is a king to do in these circumstances? Edward VIII may have been born to be king but at times like the present he wishes that weren't the case. Bertie isn't even around anymore to talk to, and the rebels that support his niece... well, the less said about what they might do the better. What is a king suppsed to say when half the populace looks ready to murder the other half? How does he calm those with legitimate grievances against the government's actions?\n\nAlec is of no help in the matter. Wallis knows how to convince the upper class, but the speech will be heard by a nation, not merely the aristocracy. Of course if the Germans misinterpret what he says, well... it will have been a short government indeed. He might hate the job, but it has fallen to him nonetheless."
ENG_whole_state_under_there_desc:0 "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, a catch all term for a problem that has eluded solutions for nigh on twenty years. The current organisation is probably better described as a combination of three. David Stirling and his Commandos are the largest rogue military unit in England which didn't surrender following the war, and the only one still active in England proper. Bill Alexander and the Left Resistance are an amalgamation of assorted leftist partisans and Labour supporters, though they might not be as influential as the CPGB that perished at Third Cable Street. Infuriatingly however, the original HMMLR's leader is unknown, some spymaster in the shadows no doubt if he even still lives, but he somehow managed to get almost every major partisan organisation in England to answer to him despite ideological differences. This organisation is a thorn in our side, we must excise it."
ENG_the_gears_are_moving_desc:0 "The funny thing about any moving machine is that it keeps moving, even when the operator is no longer there to guide it. Everyone can agree that the statement applies to HMMLR, but with different definitions. The collaborationist government thinks that the organization is like a speeding car with no driver, going aimlessly until it runs out of fuel or veers off the road and comes to a halt. They see the rebellion as a shadow of its former self, huddled in the hills or cowering in the sewers, and a victory for law and order against the forces of anarchy is a matter of when instead of if.\n\nThe men and women of HMMLR, however, prefer a different analogy. They see themselves as a different machine, one that does not need an operator once activated. One that can safely be left alone until the moment to fulfill its duty is at hand. They are a ticking time bomb, and they are counting down to the beginning of His Majesty's speech."
ENG_big_big_love_desc:0 "Most of HMMLR are moderates by any sense of the word, men and women who want freedom more than anything more specific. But David Stirling and Bill Alexander have other goals. Stirling wants revenge. He's about the only surviving man still in the country who never surrendered and he's lost a lot of friends for that. Bill Alexander wants his revolution, though he's willing to forego that to get the Germans out of Britain for good. He lost a lot of friends on Third Cable Street during the first uprising, but he survived, and he'll have his turn to do the killing.\n\nAuchinleck meanwhile, he wants the traitor King's speech to be a proper show. Complete with HMMLR as the entertainment. Stirling and Alexander might hate the other's guts, but they've more experience in guerilla warfare than the rest of HMMLR combined. Time for them to use it."
ENG_almost_there_desc:0 "The King's speech is shaping up to be quite the event. Some might want to break out the champagne and call it a day, but London is practically being isolated in preparation for it. The question on everyone's lips, though, is why? Third Cable Street was years ago and there hasn't been any real violence in London since. It's almost like the government is worried about something.\n\nThe press for their part are busy speculating and issuing declarations of solidarity, but some speculate as to whether its quite necessary to block off all of London and put in the curfews for what is, at best, a theoretical threat? The government, for its part, has decided that they will go ahead with these measures anyway."
ENG_keeping_ahead_desc:0 "Batten down the hatches, for the London police are ready for any and all interventions. Crowds will be carefully monitored and methods of evacuation and detention planned out beforehand. Any suspicious individuals will be kept well away from the main viewing sections and there will be exceptionally thorough checks for stashed weapons in the days before the speech commences.\n\nHis Majesty will enjoy a nice speech, a polite lunch afterwards and will then go home, end of story, without interference from any rebel scum. Those HMMLR buggers think they can get the best of the London police? Well, they have another thing coming."
ENG_writing_on_the_walls_desc:0 "One need only look at the streets of London to see how ripe the city is for revolution. It's like a bale of hay only in need of a spark to set the entire house afire. The police are no problem; those who aren't on our side will be dealt with by the ones who are, if they can't be bribed into staying back of course.\n\nThe crowds: that was something Bill's lads solved. Turns out when you know half the unions in the country you can get a few of them to turn out and act as a... disruptive influence for a public event, like this speech. With Stirling's lot acting as civvies to lead them we ought to give the King a right surprise when he turns up for tea and biscuits, something this entire country will remember forever."
ENG_the_kings_speech_desc:0 "The day has come, King Edward VIII of the House of Windsor may not be a well liked man, but he is nonetheless the King of England. The speech it would appear will start at midday and go on for an hour or so before his majesty attends a late lunch with some notable public figures.\n\nOf course that assumes everything goes to plan. Both HMMLR and the Government know something will occur, but what exactly happens is up to the will of God at this point. The coin of history tosses and turns in the air, the face upon which it will land unknown by even those who threw it. Perhaps HMMLR will be correct in their assumption that all the dry tinder needs is a spark, or perhaps the government prepared well, who can say? Only one way to find out..."

ENG_edwards_round_table_desc:0 "Part of the job of kingship is maintaining the relationships between politicians to ensure that, in theory at least, a government can cooperate even in the midst of a crisis. Alec Douglas-Home is by far the most capable Prime Minister to grace England since the war, and Margaret Thatcher is amongst the most influential of the new generation of politicians and is the voice of the party membership. These two obviously merit invitations to any discussion on national policy.\n\nWhere it becomes more difficult is in the extremes of the Royal Party. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is the main voice of the Germanophile and overtly fascist wing of the party, whilst Harold Macmillan is the foremost reformist to hold any great degree of influence. Unfortunately, both are likely to refuse to cooperate with the other. We must choose one to deal with."
ENG_chestertons_intensity_desc:0 "Arthur Chesterton, our Security Minister, is our first head on the round table. Although some in our government question Chesterton's fervor, and his support of the Germans, the King has assured the council that Chesterton will be happy to work with everyone. Already, Chesterton has called for curfews and increased presence of armed policemen on the streets, in the interest of national security, of course."
ENG_a_fist_and_will_desc:0 "Chesterton has informed His Majesty that a drastic increase in the size of the military is necessary to provide security and destroy the rebellion - a strong fist to smash any resistance to our government. The military shall call up more to serve, and will deploy to the North, which Chesterton believes is a hotbed of resistance activity. Although some generals are skeptical that this expansion is possible, and strongly oppose deploying troops to the cities and countryside, Chesterton has assured them he has the blessing of His Majesty in the endeavour."
ENG_terror_tactics_desc:0 "Apparently the military increase was not enough for Chesterton. In a meeting with the King, government officials, and military leadership, Chesterton has demanded the military use all available means to strike fear into the rebels. He believes that this will destroy the will of the resistance, and they will be sent scurrying back to their holes. Some of our generals have threatened to disobey any order that would use \"terror tactics\" against their own people, and have been drawing comparisons to the Luftwaffe blitz of London during the invasion. However, Chesterton has reminded His Majesty, and everyone present, that these rebels are not Englishmen, but traitors who will get exactly what they deserve."
ENG_towards_the_north_desc:0 "Chesterton has decided the army shall head north to root out HMMLR once and for all. The north has always been a hotbed of resistance activity, and their closeness to Scotland allows for dissidents to slip through our fingers. This shall go on no longer. The army shall crush the resistance in one swift stroke."
ENG_use_the_blackshirts_desc:0 "The Blackshirts were started by Mosely, but have grown to serve us long after the traitor had fled. This paramilitary group is known for their ferocity and devotion to the facist cause. Although many in government dismiss them as racist, violent hooligans, Chesterton believes that they would bolster our forces, and their absolute devotion would intimidate the resistance into submission."
ENG_dominate_sheffield_desc:0 "Sheffield, although devastated during the Blitz, has managed to recover and become a vital transportation and industrial hub in Yorkshire. The Sheffield Railway station, in the event of an uprising, would be key in transporting troops from our southern bases to the rebellious north. Therefore, Chesterton has pushed for the Blackshirts to step up their operations in Yorkshire, and for the military to set up checkpoints in Sheffield, especially around the station. We must not allow the gateway to the north to fall, at any cost."
ENG_edwards_trip_to_germania_desc:0 "The King goes to Germany, and with him goes the fascist ideologue Arthur Chesterton. Rumors surrounding the visit indicate that they supposedly intend to request that some of the restrictions on the English military be lifted, while purchasing some German equipment to assist in equipping the suddenly much larger English armed forces.\n\nThis is the first time in years that England has shown any sign of being more than a reluctant appendage of the Greater German Reich, and is sure to intrigue the Germanian bureaucrats, possibly with favourable results for us."
ENG_homes_experience_desc:0 "His Majesty has brought in the current Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home, to his round table to solve this rebel problem. Already, the Prime Minister has addressed Parliament, calling for "unity and order" in these uncertain times. His Majesty hopes that the longest serving post-war Prime Minister can help him weather England through this crisis."
ENG_unite_the_voters_desc:0 "The Prime Minister hopes to unite the voters of England behind the government. Although the Royal Party is still the most popular in England, it is no secret that we have, to put it lightly, influenced the system to keep it this way. Thus, the people are not completely supportive of the government, which explains the growing popularity of HMMLR. To turn the public away from supporting the resistance, we must campaign on bringing the people together in these uncertain times, and reassure voters that everything will be fine."
ENG_speak_with_the_army_desc:0 "Prime Minister Home has called a meeting of our top generals, in order to discuss the worst case scenario - open rebellion. Although the Prime Minister hopes that it will never come to this, we wouldn't want to be caught unaware. General Montgomery says that we can raise two impromptu divisions in the event of an uprising to supplement our army. As well, he recommends not to deploy the military to police civilians, as this will only turn them against us."
ENG_convincing_the_midlands_desc:0 "Home has chosen the Midlands as our focus in unifying the country. The north is lost, and the south is firmly in our grasp. The Midlands however remain a battleground, torn between us and HMMLR. If we can convince them to support us, any possible uprising would be severely weakened without their support."
ENG_locate_the_cells_desc:0 "For far too long, HMMLR has operated under our noses. The full extent of their reach was revealed in the fateful assault on our King. Home has given full authority to MI5 and Field Marshal Montgomery to step up infiltration and intelligence operations. Once we're through, there will be nowhere for them to hide."
ENG_a_radical_a_day_desc:0 "'A radical a day keeps the revolution away' will be our new motto. The public will be convinced that although we seek to unite the nation, we will not tolerate traitorous activities. Whenever we capture one of those traitors, we shall broadcast it for the whole nation to see. Their faces shall be known, their crimes shall be heard, and their punishments shall be seen far and wide."
ENG_a_shaky_compromise_desc:0 "Macmillan is a fool, unaware of the wrath his reforms would bring upon us. Chesterton is worse, almost treacherous in his desire to bow to German might. The moderate wing has led England through thick and thin these past decades, and it shall be they who once more step up to the task of preserving England whatever the more misguided of her people may think.\n\nAlexander Douglas-Home and Margaret Thatcher will work together to ensure this, a partnership that will provide salvation to England from that which would menace her, whilst also keeping her independence from untrustworthy allies."
ENG_macmillans_reasoning_desc:0 "His Majesty has brought in Harold Macmillan, leader of the Reformist wing of the Royal Party. Already, more hardline and even some moderate members of the party question whether going soft after this terrible attack will just weaken our position, but His Majesty believes that Macmillan's cool head and intelligence will bring a cool-headedness to his round table."
ENG_uniting_parliament_desc:0 "Macmillan believes that to unite the nation, we first must unite the squabbling politicians in Parliament. Everyone here has a common love of England, so for now, everyone,from the most reform minded to the most hardline among us, must put aside our differences to calm the people down and unite the country."
ENG_talk_to_the_lower_classes_desc:0 "We must start a dialogue with the lower class if we want to keep this country together. They are the most vulnerable to be swayed towards HMMLR's lies. If we can promise some token reforms and begin talks about future liberalization, hopefully the masses will be content and not fall into the resistance's ranks."
ENG_focus_on_the_south_desc:0 "Macmillan has decided that the government shall focus its efforts on securing the south of England. Although the south is mostly under our control, its numerous cities hold many potential and actual HMMLR operatives. If we were to lose control of this region, London and the heart of the nation would be at risk. Therefore, we shall campaign on our promises of reform here, to convince the people that we are working to make things better."
ENG_a_plea_to_germany_desc:0 "Albert Speer is an influential man in German politics, one of the Fuhrer's most trusted advisors. He is similarly to Macmillan noted for leading the reformist wing of his nation's premier political party, and some view him as a natural successor to the world's most powerful man.\n\nMacmillan heads now to Germania, the city Speer designed brick by brick, to negotiate a trade deal more favourable to England. Rumour has it he also goes to see if England might have a future in the Pakt that is an arrangement of equals more than of subordinates. Time shall tell if he succeeds."
ENG_investigate_the_military_desc:0 "Even with our talk of unity and reform for the voters, there is one place where we cannot have a light hand. The military has escaped suspicion for far too long. It should have been obvious from the start, those old minds, stuck in the past. We shall search high and low, throughout the officers and enlisted alike. We may lose some great talent, we must root out every single traitor from our ranks."
ENG_request_additional_forces_desc:0 "Cornwall has a surplus of armed men concentrated in a small area, this is both a waste of time and supremely inefficient when it comes to dealing with HMMLR. We cannot directly raise too many more English regiments, but if Halder were to lend us his men we would not need to.\n\nAs an added bonus if we were to send these soldiers into the more dangerous of situations and they were, tragically, killed in action, we would not be spending valuable English blood on the matter, so the government really couldn't give a whit. It's a win-win situation: either Halder refuses and we can complain to Germania, or he accepts and we are one step closer to freeing our island."
ENG_expel_the_radicals_desc:0 "Sometimes to kill a cancer upon the body there can be no living with it, there is merely a choice between letting it poison you or cutting it out at the roots. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is a cancer upon the Royal Party; he represents the kind of base submission to the Germans that we had hoped Englishmen would never stoop to.\n\nSince the cancer will not leave of its own volition, we shall do the deed ourselves. Chesterton is too high profile to simply vanish, but the same cannot be said of his fellows. A few mysterious disappearances and high profile arrests for corruption will do our party a world of good. And keep us safe from German dominance."
ENG_court_the_moderates_desc:0 "The Moderates are the largest faction of the Royal Party, heirs to the conservative old guard that have long been guardians of English tradition. As a rule they tend to support the status quo, lest the consequences of breaking it spill over onto the English people, but now with that status quo changing of its own accord following the rise of HMMLR we need to convince them that change is needed.\n\nIt will be difficult, but the Moderates seek the survival of our nation above all else and will fall in line on this matter. Money directed at the projects they suggest will not find its way into the pockets of the corrupt, it will be spent as directed and as needed."
ENG_call_upon_the_garrison_desc:0 "The treaty in which the United Kingdom became England did not entirely remove the German Reich from our Isles, despite our hopes. While the Wehrmacht withdrew from the majority of England and Wales, the peninsula of Cornwall remained occupied under the authority of General Franz Halder, officially as a guarantee of protection, unofficially as a knife pointed at our back.\n\nA harsh man, Halder has maintained military authority in Cornwall with ruthless efficiency and an iron fist, but we now find a situation in which he may once again prove useful. Halder assisted us in crushing the communists at Cable Street; perhaps he might be willing to help us with the matter of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance? But we ought to be careful, lest he seek to involve Germany more directly."
ENG_an_alternative_solution_desc:0 "Cornwall might be under temporary Wehrmacht authority, but it is English soil and internationally recognised as such. Perhaps we can use this. After all, we do indirectly control what can be imported into the military zone and we can somewhat hamper their ability to move outside it. This pressure would however serve a purpose, namely to throw them at Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance and be ready to shoot whoever emerges with the most wounds.\n\nActing in such a manner might be somewhat negatively viewed in the Reich, but in London and the other cities of England it might give our government, forced together out of necessity as it is, some genuine public support."
ENG_secure_our_heads_desc:0 "General Halder is being rather reluctant in providing us with equipment necessary to prosecute the fight against HMMLR and the other malcontents who infest this island. Normally we might not bring this up out of politeness, but the government is well and truly running out of patience. If a kind word will not solve this matter perhaps a reminder of what we can do should we so desire will suffice.\n\nAs the English people discovered in the Blitz, a lack of food choices can truly be cancerous upon morale, and those fine German soldiers will find out that only eating canned food from Germany might well please the fatherland, but it can be somewhat harsh upon the stomach. Halder will see the true message: we control what his men eat, and we could very easily decide to add an ingredient or two."
ENG_choke_cornwall_desc:0 "General Halder is looking somewhat more approachable today, but it is best when you want something from a dog to ask its master to command it. Germania no doubt sees the weakness of its representative in England; it is quite possible that if we simply ask, Halder will hand over the required military equipment.\n\nHe can technically refuse us, but the same does not apply in any way to his superiors. That said, this will make the higher ranking officers of the Garrison less likely to converse civilly with us in the future, but do we truly need them once we have the equipment anyway?"
ENG_britannia_on_her_knees_desc:0 "Franz Halder rules unopposed in Cornwall no matter the official status of the peninsula, and the only way to change that might put us squarely in the Germany's crosshairs. Something we cannot afford, even now. Thus, if we wish the assistance of the Garrison, we will need to beg for it.\n\nHalder will have a price no doubt, perhaps material or perhaps nationally motivated, and we will pay it. In return he will crush HMMLR, the communists, the deserters and those loyal to the false Queen all. This is a sacrifice that will be difficult to make, but we must not think of ourselves in these times, but of our children who will pay the price if we fail."
ENG_prevent_an_icarus_desc:0 "The Greeks tell of a boy who flew so close to the sun that it burned him; England surrendered to the Germans, because defeating them on our own was not practical or indeed possible, lest we ended up like Icarus. But the rebels don't seem to be willing to recognise this, a stark example of why they must be kept from power at all costs.\n\nTo counteract the possibility, a simple solution might just be to increase overall funding of the police. Besides greatly aiding our capabilities in regards to locating the HMMLR associates, it might just help us defeat them should the worst happen."
ENG_the_garrison_grows_desc:0 "The Cornwall Garrison is the arm of the Reich's protection in England, dedicated to preventing us from being subjugated to American whims ever again. Of course, such a force is appreciated but it is also small, more suited to crushing a small revolt than anything larger in scale. Arthur Chesterton intends to change this, requesting that the King ask for an increase in the Garrison's size so as to more effectively deal with the HMMLR organisation and its insidious plots against the integrity of England. This may not be popular with our own military or people, but when it comes to survival or pride survival always takes precedence. Always, else we would not be here at all."
ENG_locate_the_snakes_head_desc:0 "There's someone behind all this. HMMLR's leader is organizing everything behind the scenes. He's behind these activities, and will inevitably strike again. We need to hunt him down and kill him. Without his leadership, the resistance will fall apart and we will have averted a terrible catastrophe. Eliminate the bastard, and we will have won.\n\nIf we can find where he is."
ENG_Collab_not_enough_time_desc:0 "Germany has descended into chaos. Would-be Hitlers have sprouted up all over, and are fighting each other. It is clear that no aid will now come from the Reich, save for a few aimless soldiers in the Plymouth garrison.\n\nThe rebels know this as well. There is no greater opportunity for them. All their planning, all their plots and preparing, they will use it now. For there will be no other time when we are so weak. The hour of our greatest test must come.\n\nGod save England!"

ENG_days_of_the_resistance_desc:0 "Auchinleck, Alexander and Stirling. The first is a name not known by too many, aside from as a curiosity being the last General standing when the call to surrender was sounded. The second is probably the best known by the general public, one of the few rebels to escape Cable Street and a constant reminder of those darker times. Stirling is known only by those who hunt him - those who still live.\n\nTogether they represent HMMLR, an organisation dedicated to as many causes as its members have political leanings, but undeniably united in the desire for a Free England. One free of tyranny, free of traitors... and free of the Germans. The partnership is one of convenience but all involved intend to see it out 'till the end, until the Collaborationists are defeated or they've died trying."
ENG_stirlings_methods_desc:0 "Most of HMMLR don't want to get involved in the shady stuff. Can't blame them, as it's all horrible work. Bombs in traitor cars, men with guns waiting in unfortunate buggers' rooms at night. Makes a gent feel a bit dishonourable, really. Still - they sold us out to the Germans, so it's not as if they didn't earn it.\n\nThe Reds do the same if we're honest, but they've had to learn it. Cable Street killed all their best and even the bloody Red General can't make new soldiers from thin air like he can everything else. Stirling taught us the fight was dirty from the start: give no quarter and receive none, fight 'till you're dead and then some more. What makes killing a dozen at dinner any less honourable than a thousand on a battlefield?"
ENG_a_couple_of_tongues_desc:0 "Careless lips sink ships? That was what the Government told us before they turned out to be traitors anyway. Still, that particular nugget of wisdom applies now more than ever: half the reason the Reds failed at Cable Street is that their comms lacked sophistication, compromised months before the showdown and the traitors were waiting with guns at the ready when their revolution began.\n\nStirling isn't the nicest boss but he knows what's what. You don't just catch the spies and throw them in the sea anymore, you've got to find out what they told the traitors first. If they don't want to talk? Well, we might not be elegant in our means, but we do know how to make a lovely example."
ENG_who_dares_wins_desc:0 "Stirling led the SAS during the war, fought the German bastards from Africa till they landed over in England. Of course he picked up a trick or two when he was doing all that: how to make lads talk, how to hide the equipment from aerial searches and all that nice stuff. Most importantly, though, he figured out that the best way to fight someone with more shit than you was to always hit first.\n\nA traitor can't fight when you've gone and stolen his weapon. A tank won't run if dynamite's been shoved in the treads, and those wonderful airplanes don't appreciate having a grenade or two tossed in the engines. Fighting fair is for those who want to die fairly; the traitors have no honour, and we sure as hell won't give them any."
ENG_taking_the_midlands_desc:0 "England's Midlands are flat country, not many hills and only scattered woodland to break up the endless landscape of fields and villages. Not a land one would think lends itself well to guerilla warfare. Yet that is exactly what David Stirling has done for the last two decades.\n\nStirling would have HMMLR take up the struggle in the centre of the country, able to split the Collaborationist forces in two from the start and gain control of the vital industry in the region's cities. Birmingham is an excellent staging point for supplying ammunition and guns throughout England. Bill Alexander is less keen on moving, as the Midlands are far from the Left Resistance's power base, but he is willing to cede to Auchinleck's judgement on the matter."
ENG_an_order_to_hand_over_desc:0 "The traitors purged the army of most lads who can think for themselves, or that's what Stirling says when he mocks their corpses. The thing about a rebellion is that, without some guns to shoot the traitors with, the whole thing will be over rather quickly. Even the Reds can't ship in enough firearms to equip us all. Which is where our lot come in.\n\nProtocol doesn't change that much from year to year in the army, which means that when a very cross looking colonel turns up at a depot with a convoy of trucks asking why the fuck they aren't ready to be packed already, the poor buggers on duty jump to it quick. Helped along by a few of our own on the inside, of course. I'm told the haul was over 20,000 semi-automatic rifles alone. "
ENG_they_will_speak_of_york_desc:0 "Sussex. Aside from Coventry, you'll be hard pressed to find a more accursed part of England. Must be why Stirling loves the place. Loves the food, the atmosphere, the silly little traitors running about like headless chickens after we blow up a convoy. Sussex also is the linchpin to control the southern English coast by default, and if we can secure it for HMMLR we might just be able to give the more military minded lads an edge on the day of reckoning.\n\nOf course, we need to be careful to not attract the Garrison's attention. The traitors might be something of a joke when faced with our people, but the Germans only leave their best on our isle. Stirling says he likes the challenge, but even he knows his bravado only goes so far."
ENG_operation_bad_morning_desc:0 "It would be easy if we told ourselves that the traitors were all rotten from the start, but that isn't so, no matter what some of the Reds think. Sad fact is that most of the lads we fight don't know better, which is why it's all the more important that we get the ones who knew what an occupation of England would mean and went ahead anyway.\n\nGerald Templer fought with distinction for Britain in the first war with Germany; shame he couldn't have kept his spine for the second. Bastard was amongst those who signed the treaty, and no matter how many hints have been dropped his way he's never shown an interest in the cause. It's a big risk, but we know his driver and if we can smuggle a present into his car we might just strike a blow for all the world to see."
ENG_claudes_strategy_desc:0 "HMMLR is, despite the name, not united by a dedication to the restoration of the Queen, even if a significant portion of the membership supports it. In a movement with communists, republicans, and even a handful of fascists who've seen the light, what unites HMMLR is the figure of Claude Auchinleck.\n\nKnown to most simply as 'the Boss', almost nobody outside HMMLR's upper ranks is aware the former general turned MP leads the greatest rebel group in the Isles, and they would like to keep it that way. Claude Auchinleck united those who believe in a free England through sheer unwavering will, and he has kept his position by keeping the movement alive despite many attempts by the Collaborationist Government to ensure the opposite. HMMLR answers to Auchinleck, and no one else."
ENG_the_leader_speaks_desc:0 "Propaganda has value, something Claude Auchinleck has come to know quite keenly in the fight for English liberation. But when all the general public knows of HMMLR's rumoured leader is a shadowy figure playing chessmaster, it might be understandable that they feel uneasy about him. So Auchinleck took the risk of making his first public speech to the HMMLR membership.\n\nWith a scarf concealing his identity and some deliberate altering of the recorded audio, no one will ever guess the mild mannered MP from Hampshire is the one addressing a hall of HMMLR's most notorious militants. It is a speech that delves into many topics: the ruination of English soil, the unjust imprisonment of martyrs, the corruption of institutions once respected. But at the end, the hall and many people in their homes have but one thing to say. God Save the Queen."
ENG_flood_of_volunteers_desc:0 "As a Member of Parliament and a War Hero, Claude Auchinleck is afforded a certain respect by much of England. He was the last man standing in Carlisle after all, and as such he has become that patron of several charitable organisations in addition to hosting many public events.\n\nIt's merely a coincidence that HMMLR recruiters also frequent these events, and that Auchinleck often speaks to those who have reason to be disaffected from the current social order. Auchinleck knows that HMMLR cannot rely entirely on its extant forces: when the day of liberation comes every man who can hold a rifle will be needed. Thanks to his efforts, there may be a few more than expected."
ENG_staying_in_the_north_desc:0 "Claude Auchinleck fought the last battle of a united Britain around Carlisle, a desperate defence that culminated in him being forced to capitulate only as the official surrender was signed, buying time for Wimberley to retreat into Scotland. The North is his home as easily as London, and it's where HMMLR had built up a substantial network of support before even contacting Alexander and Stirling.\n\nSo it is fitting then that the freedom of England shall be reborn where it died, in the foothills of Northumberland and the dreary coasts of the Irish sea. Scotland is an unknown at this point in time, but even if they dare not oppose the Germans openly, they will almost certainly aid us with supplies and volunteers, even foreign ones. Of course the North will be more agreeable to the ever squabbling Alexander and Stirling as well, as it favours neither."
ENG_we_await_mr_president_desc:0 "The Americans are perhaps the only overseas ally we possess who can offer us more than cast offs and hand me downs in terms of material support. More importantly though, they are vital to our long term plans after England is liberated. Without American backing and membership within the Organization of Free Nations, England will be invaded whenever the Germans feel like it.\n\nTo that end, strengthening our relationship with Washington is a vital part of our operations, including, if need be, affirming certain basing rights following the war. For now though, all we need is the assurance that aid will come - not openly of course, lest the Germans involve themselves in turn - when we launch our uprising."
ENG_dominate_lancashire_desc:0 "Lancashire is perhaps the third most populous area in England, containing Manchester and several populous towns besides. As an industrial region, control of Lancashire will grant HMMLR a solid base from which to liberate the southern regions of England, for if we have control of the North then the South shall follow.\n\nThe process of doing so may be difficult, but it is worth the cost. We have contacts in the councils and trade unions, and the police are already mostly on our side, so we need not fear collaborationist interference there. But we will have to ensure that any troublesome elements are dealt with as soon as the call of liberation sounds. Not killed, but detained for the duration of our struggle."
ENG_operation_stock_desc:0 "A deficit of munitions is a consistent problem for our organisation. Smuggling can only mitigate the problem and heavy calibre weapons are scarce even amongst our better equipped units. Operation STOCK aims to solve this problem for us: several old depots near Carlisle are full of weapons, including numerous grenades and even some outdated tanks the Germans never got around to looting.\n\nHowever, as the facilities are guarded, we shall need at least six hours to evacuate the more valuable equipment, and that means silencing the area without regional collaborationist forces getting wind. Not impossible, especially with the German Garrison being far away. We will, however, need just a bit of luck, and quite possibly some silencers."
ENG_bills_connections_desc:0 "The revolution is not yet dead, not whilst Bill Alexander lives. He survived the war, Cable Street, and Russia, and there's no way in hell the fascists can succeed where their masters in Germania failed. He built the Left Resistance from the ground up, and now the revolution begins again.\n\nOur connection to the exile communities exceed even that of HMMLR proper, and with most of the dockworker's unions on our side, smuggling in supplies, weapons and even people is no problem at all. When HMMLR need explosives they come to us, when they need a message sent they ask us to do the sending, and whilst that bunch of monarchists might be reactionary they're in agreement with us on the main point: England will be free or dead by the time we're done."
ENG_under_their_noses_desc:0 "Smuggling might not be a dignified profession, but the revolution isn't built on soldiers alone. We need engineers, truck mechanics and factory workers just as badly as we do lads with a gun, and coming up with supplies in England can be a bit hard these days. Hence why the southern dockyards and their constant flow of ships are so important to us. With forewarning, we can get a shipment of old Yank rifles from dockside Liverpool to London or Carlisle in two days, less if we don't have to bribe the fascist guards.\n\nOf course our ability to get to and fro comes with some other uses too: more than one fascist official has gone missing on an evening stroll. More than a few others will join them."
ENG_win_with_wingate_desc:0 "The revolution has friends in high places: it has had to in order to survive these troubled times. One of them is a General working for the government by the name of Orde Wingate. No doubt the fascists thought him theirs when they negotiated his release from the Japanese after the war, but Wingate never forgot who abandoned him and his men to die, and he was most receptive to our plans for England. \n\nWingate will approach the fascist government to inquire as to whether he might train a force to hunt down Stirling and his Commandos who went rogue at the war's end, using the same tactics to track and eventually defeat them. Of course, what Wingate will actually be doing is training the beginning of a Red Army. One that will bring the fascists to their knees."
ENG_moving_south_desc:0 "Southern England is not a friendly place for would-be rebels. HMMLR avoids it as much as possible and even Stirling is reluctant to antagonise the Cornwall Garrison more than absolutely necessary. Perhaps then, it should be considered impressive that the South is the nucleus of Left Resistance support, centred around the dockyards, the factories and those closest to the unyielding boot of fascism.\n\nStarting a rebellion in the South is a risky proposition, but it also offers significant rewards if we can capitalise on early success. Surrounding London will make us appear to be the more legitimate government, and the Cornwall Garrison can be isolated and eliminated before it can call for German support. Alexander also promises that he can mobilise the hopeful revolutionaries into an army given time, but Stirling is hesitant. The decision falls to Auchinleck."
ENG_o_canada_desc:0 "Canada is famously the home of reactionary monarchy which opposes the fascist monarchy, which one might suppose is an improvement of sorts, but more importantly for the Left Resistance and by extension HMMLR, the Labour Underground has significant contacts in the former Dominion. Most of this support is political, legitimising our struggle with the exile community and Canadian government, but a significant amount of our material support originates from Canada as well.\n\nBill Alexander is of the opinion that the revolution needs allies to survive and thus far, few can call him incorrect. Given the events of Cable Street, Canada is a valuable lifeline. It might be time to start making extensive use of it."
ENG_sharpen_the_sickle_desc:0 "The revolutionary movement does not possess the elite force of Stirling's Commandos, nor do we have a truly large following in the armed forces like HMMLR, loyal to the memory of the monarchy. What we do possess however, is perhaps the greatest militia network in England, formed around the trade unions and factory workers. When the time comes the English proletariat will rise as one, and the fascists will pay their price in blood.\n\nFor now though we must organise these militias, give them goals and equipment so as to effect change on a more strategic level. Docks must be secured, arms factories for the enemy sabotaged, and their lines of communication cut if at all possible. For now as we sit back and sharpen the sickle of the revolution, we wait only for the hammer to fall upon its anvil."
ENG_operation_broken_telephone_desc:0 "Generals Michael O'Moore Creagh and John Frederick Boyce Combe are two of the main fascist commanders in the south of England. Creagh personally helped slaughter our comrades on Cable Street and Combe should have known better than to side with the fascists even if they did negotiate his release from Italy. Alexander has given the order: both are to be eliminated, and Reg Birch's friend in intelligence, Philby, has some information that might be of use.\n\nThe two tend to work together and occasionally congregate with several friends in a small country manor near Oxford to discuss the situation. As it so happens, we have liberated a stock of dynamite, and the manor has a basement. If we get lucky, they won't leave the building alive."
ENG_operation_inspection_desc:0 "Montagu Stopford - the name even sounds right for a bloody traitor. Well the problem with killing the bugger is that he's a bit paranoid; what kind of man swaps hotels at the last minute just because there was a storm? We wasted three perfectly good grenades on that bed! To top off the problem, he's well aware of the Commandos' weaknesses - he's just about the only traitor who's given us a bloody nose.\n\nBut the boss wants him gone and Stirling has been the one set to do it. It seems the unfortunate fellow is set to inspect some new recruits to the traitor cause. It would be such a damn shame if one of them were to have a 'misfire'."
ENG_operation_look_up_desc:0 "The fascists have something of an advantage over HMMLR in terms of their air capacity; we rely entirely on what few pilots are sympathetic to the revolutionary cause within the RAF whilst they have the bulk of the air force under lock and key. On top of that, we have been tasked by Auchinleck with removing one of the more competent fascist generals, a Michael Carver, from the table.\n\nBut an opportunity has arisen to kill two birds with one stone, for the fascist general is set to give a speech following the inspection of several planes donated by the Reich, new planes with a fearsome capacity for destruction. The revolution would be well served to be rid of them, and a few sabotaged engines and a kill team hiding amongst the aircrews should take care of the fascist and aircraft alike."
ENG_operation_loud_and_clear_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery was once our greatest champion; now he is a symbol of the collaborationist regime second to none. He signed the treaty with Germany following the fall of London and was the man who ordered Auchinleck to lay down his arms personally. His death is not something that can be argued against, it must happen and it must be done swiftly. The man might be old but he has a fearsome mind for tactics. \n\nMontgomery intends to take a brief trip to Cornwall to reconnoitre with the Garrison command there. It is up to HMMLR to ensure he never reaches that destination. As a final note, Auchinleck has requested that he not suffer unduly."
ENG_down_the_rabbit_hole_desc:0 "Bill Alexander has operated in the South of England for longer than just about anyone. He knows the lay of the land and has explained to the HMMLR High Command that it is impractical to just throw men at Cornwall and expect to get anywhere. A careful approach must be taken to neutralize them, subvert their men, kill the competent, bribe the weak minded and sabotage what we cannot steal. \n\nThis approach has its limits, of course, but we might be capable of getting more in the long term this way. If we get the right sort of people on our side in Truro, we might even find an opportunity to deal some permanent damage. The kind even a souless German cannot recover from."
ENG_pay_them_enough_desc:0 "The German Garrison in Cornwall is for the most part well trained, well disciplined and ruthlessly efficient, but every army has its weak links. In the case of the Garrison, it would appear that many of the lower ranking officers are of dubious loyalty to their vaunted fatherland, and more than open to taking bribes in return for looking the other way in regards to certain actions. The stealing of equipment, or not patrolling a section of the beaches for an hour or two.\n\nTruly the revolution has no greater ally than the incompetence of the fascists. We will render the Garrison in Cornwall a lackluster ally to the Traitor King. Here's hoping he quakes in his boots when he realises it."
ENG_and_remove_the_rest_desc:0 "Sometimes it pays to be direct. For every officer willing to take a bribe, there exists one who represents the peak of Germanic efficiency. As such, Alexander has formulated a solution to the problem: we shoot them.\n\nWell, not just shoot them. Bombs, car accidents, accidental doses of cyanide in the sauerkraut, maybe a faked suicide or three. In the end, as long as they die, we won't question how. Perhaps it might be prudent to just make a few vanish outright and scare the more cowardly into deserting? It's a problem solved at any rate. Something Auchinleck should be very happy about indeed."
ENG_be_more_practical_desc:0 "Why exactly the Boss told us to head down to Cornwall was fairly obvious: we don't get along with Germans all that well. Stirling had a plan to enact before we even reached the joint, and there's a slightly greater than even chance it involves copious amounts of explosives.\n\nThe fun thing about Cornwall is that it has all these things we normally don't get to blow up, steal, or kill. Infrastructure, brand new German weapons by the crateload, and even unwary German officers just standing on the street corners like they're waiting around for us. Of course, security is tight, and there's no chance the Commandos will be able to stick around for long, but it ought to be fun while it lasts."
ENG_take_whats_ours_desc:0 "The thing about a German military depot that makes it so much more exciting than a regular depot is the fact that we really don't have to worry about things like not shooting the bystanders. That, and their toys are a lot bigger than the ones we usually play around with. \n\nStirling wants a route to ship all the stuff we nick back to Auchinleck and HQ, and it seems that might just be doable, assuming we can get in contact with Alexander's lot at the ports. The land border is just too heavily guarded for Stirling's liking."
ENG_and_then_some_more_desc:0 "It turns out there are more places to store contraband in a ship than the average person might think. Who would have guessed you could shove a tank into the hull of a yacht? Mind, we still haven't figured out a method of getting it out, but we're working on it. Ammunition is in good supply too; it seems for all their postering, the Germans in Cornwall leave their depots lightly guarded with remarkable regularity, though that could be an indirect result of us shooting them.\n\nStill, Stirling says we'll be making our getaway soon. It seems the High Command are getting nervous about retaliation, but they just have one more job they'd like us to do first."
ENG_operation_franz_desc:0 "Franz Halder is the man who holds England in an iron grip. His Cornwall Garrison enforces the will of the Reich, and it is well past time that he paid for his crimes. We won't likely get an opportunity to try him, so it has been decided that assassinating him works just as well. In this case any blowback we receive will be well worth it, the man and his inner circle are irreplaceable officers and doubly so for their familiarity with England.\n\nThe plan itself has a few points of failure as possible. We intend to be in and out before the Garrison, much less the Collaborationist Government, is aware anything has even happened. We won't likely get a chance to repeat this attempt, since it will put the Garrison on high alert for months. We can only wish the assigned men the best of luck."
ENG_HMMLR_not_enough_time_desc:0 "Time is something that is not on our side. The Collaborationist Government is aware of this too: while we have stymied their best attempts to root us out thus far, each day that passes is more guns produced, more men recruited, more of our cells discovered.\n\nAuchinleck, Alexander and Stirling have conferred with each other: the time is now. The war of liberation, of revolution, of revenge, a war for a Free England. For a better England. For all England. The men and women willing to take up arms for our cause are ready, we only await the word to strike our foes. Perhaps one day this will be remembered in song. We can only hope that song isn't a sad one."

ENG_an_end_of_the_disaster_desc:0 "The English Civil War, a conflict which ravaged lives and tore apart centuries of peace upon our hallowed isle, has ended at last. The traitors and communists of HMMLR are captured, dead or on the run and their American backers seem to have given up on attempting to assert their influence for the moment. All it cost was the blood of tens of thousands of people.\n\nYet in the midst of this tragedy we can yet look to the future. England has remained independent and free of obligation to those parasites across the Atlantic, now we can rebuild what was lost. The government which led England for two decades continues its guidance, with luck this shall continue for a long time to come."
ENG_a_message_for_edward_desc:0 "Alec Douglas-Home is the most successful Prime Minister England has had at the helm in well over two decades, a man who united the squabbling Royal Party and its Hardliner and Reformist Wings into a force to be reckoned with whilst repairing some of the damage strife and corruption had done to governmental institutions.\n\nYet war takes its toll on men, and a civil war doubly so for those whose deaths you order were once friends and colleagues, brothers in arms and compatriots. Prime Minister Douglas-Home shall be handing in his resignation to the King, a successor is already in place in the form of that young Thatcher woman. She's a smart one by any measurement and the party will keep her in line should she let power get to her head. There is little better time to announce such a change."
ENG_the_oxford_trials_desc:0 "HMMLR fought in the name of a failed branch of the House of Windsor who were part of the group that led our nation to ruin in the Second World War, perhaps it is unsurprising that they were utterly defeated. Irregardless we now hold many thousands of their members prisoner and we need to do something with them. Not in London obviously, too many people around and too easy for things to go wrong.\n\nOxford is close enough that we can transport the leaders of HMMLR in with no issue, there in the university grounds ravaged by conflict we will decide the fate of those people who would tear our country down for such petty reasons. Heedless of if their actions might open up the possibility of the Germans reinvading the moment they looked out way. Let them suffer justice, let it be swift and public."
ENG_meeting_with_montomery_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery has been our foremost military commander for some decades now. If one ignores his failure in the face of the Reich, the man has defeated every foe to come against him, including a good number of his former colleagues during the Civil War. Speaking of which, his presence in that most dreadful conflict is what enabled us to win, and we ought to reward him handsomely.\n\nParades, some commemorative medals for the soldiery and a few memorials to start off. But he must also be informed of the change in leadership that is soon to occur. He might be one of the old guard, but Montgomery values stability as much as the next man. As such, we know he'll do the right thing."
ENG_an_announcement_for_everyone_desc:0 "Douglas-Home has settled the matter of succession with the Moderate faction of the Royal Party higher ups long ago. Margaret Thatcher is bright enough to not be befuddled by the political machinations of the reformists or the brute demagogue nature of the hardliners, whilst also not having a power base of her own with which she might deviate from the Royal Party's own goals. The Moderates will have the power they have earned through blood, sweat and tears.\n\nNow it is a mere matter of informing the rest of the nation that a change of management is due. It should be fine, England has had what, a dozen Prime Ministers resign by this point? It is doubtful the person on the street will even notice."
ENG_and_now_its_on_fire_desc:0 "Well, one might say that the whole "Tell the other factions leadership that the PM is resigning and we have a new one" matter might have gone horribly wrong. Horribly in the sense of, the Royal Party no longer has a majority in government and we cannot get enough independents to work with us to form a new one.\n\nThe "Royal Divorce" as the event is becoming known, means that England might be forced to hold new elections soon. Unlike previous elections under the Royal Party we now have a potentially serious opposition and no way to effectively keep them from running. The future of this nation is up in the air like a coin, and nobody is certain upon which head it shall land. That of reform or stability?"
ENG_no_chance_to_win_mac_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a party of stability, of safety and an unflinching iron will. Margaret Thatcher might be young, but she grew up amidst the violence of the Second World War, survived the Civil War where many others deserted for greed or ideals, and has held together the Moderate faction of the Royal Party where others might have buckled. Let Macmillan and that oaf Chesterton try to assert otherwise but it was not they who led our nation through the greatest series of crises in living memory.\n\nWe are the Royal Party, as immovable as the island upon which we live and we will never let England suffer like the foolish leaders of old did when they fought the Reich with no hope of victory. We will move on from this setback and emerge victorious once more, whatever the cost."
ENG_not_so_easy_desc:0 "Having a third of one's party abandon ship all at the same time might seem like a downside to the unprepared, but being the party of establishment in England comes with a few advantages. For example, knowing when a politician has accepted bribes and from whom. A discreet bit of buggery might not be so discreet if the wrong person were to speak to the right papers, and that's saying nothing of the affairs we could reveal to a spouse looking for a divorce.\n\nIf they want to leave our party so badly they should have remembered that we tolerated these things only as long as they served our interests. Leaving the party means leaving our protective influence as well, and wouldn't it just be a shame for things to go wrong for a few of those men?"
ENG_we_wont_stop_winning_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a party of dignity, of tradition and of England. Whom was it who guided our fair nation through many a year of strife and difficulty? Whom was it that protected our nation from disaster and violence? It wasn't the fascists or the liberals, of that much you can be sure.\n\nWe do not need to stoop to such petty methods as blackmail when we can point to our many successes over the years. That we will also be spending a proverbial tonne of money on reconstruction efforts, orphanages and the like might not hurt our popularity with the masses. Whilst we think of it, it might be worth pointing out that our opponents are most decidedly not following our example, or minimize it when they do. Either works, but money is spent getting people onside rather than convincing our opponents to drop out."
ENG_anyone_but_chesterton_desc:0 "Say what you will about United England, they have a goal that might be stupid but is not in and of itself a terrible idea, just one they wish to enact too soon and too hastily. They are our opponents not our enemies. The same can most assuredly not be said of the National Front, the absolute last thing that our nation needs is fascists being anywhere near government. Or anywhere near society for that matter.\n\nThe National Front don't have their German masters to protect them anymore, time to deal with the rabid dog they represent. A concerted campaign against them will need to be enacted, perhaps we could even collaborate with United England on the matter. They like the National Front even less than we do after all."
ENG_what_a_useful_old_man_desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is the pathetic, shrivelled shell of a once great statesman. So bewitched by visions of a fascist England that he cannot even recognise the hole he digs for his own future. Yet that can wait for the moment, Chesterton is doing a good job gathering all of the disaffected far right behind him in one neat, recogniseable and recordable block, more importantly he is splitting the vote of those against our own party but not especially convinced by any one candidate.\n\nSo long as Chesterton is around, it will be incredibly difficult for United England to achieve an effective majority in Parliament. We can deal with the fool himself afterwards."
ENG_convince_who_we_can_desc:0 "United England is not a party of fools like the National Front, there are legitimately well intentioned men and women in that party, who were colleagues of Thatcher for years. Who is to say we cannot peel off a few dissidents led astray by Macmillan, playing nice might even enable us to integrate some of our lost base in some areas back into the fold.\n\nIf we fail, what's the worst that could happen? We are shown to be the more reasonable and stability minded of the two parties who could possibly win the election? Well, even in that scenario we don't lose anything so why not. Let us open our arms for the uncertain, let the truly foolish separate themselves from our grace here and now."
ENG_just_get_rid_of_trouble_desc:0 "When the proffered hand is rejected you do not offer another, you cut off the problem at its root. We cannot allow United England to win, the consequences might be disastrous for our nation if that fool Maudling or the scheming Macmillan get anywhere near real power. A disaffected Germany or worse, an angry one comes to mind. The Garrison might be weakened after all but it is also right here.\n\nArrest the more prominent on charges of corruption, it might not always stick but at the least we can cast doubt upon their touted honesty. Some blackmail might not be a bad idea as well, not for United England proper but those who might be tempted to support them. We will stop this nonsense if it's the last thing the Royal Party does."
ENG_midlands_is_the_key_desc:0 "The Midlands of England are one of the areas most contested by United England and ourselves. The North is their domain, the South and London mostly hold to the Royal Party. Yet the Midlands remain stubbornly uncertain in who they'll vote for. Birmingham and other cities being the worst offenders.\n\nIf the Royal Party were to devote the overwhelming majority of our funds towards campaigning in the Midlands we might very well come out of this election stronger even than before the coalition collapsed. Macmillan and his puppet Maudling likely think the same, and should they take advantage before we do it might become a difficult proposition to beat them. Margaret has suggested to our campaign managers that we move on this, quickly. "
ENG_better_focus_on_the_base_desc:0 "The South was once our stronghold, it still is to be honest. Yet there have been some worrying signs about how some of our more important constituencies might vote, and Thatcher has ordered our campaign to focus their attention on securing the region electorally. If we hold on in the South after all it doesn't matter how many seats United England wins elsewhere, nobody in a hundred years has won without London and nobody in the next hundred will either. It might not be as fancy as winning a supermajority, but for what Margaret has planned a regular majority will be more than enough. To the winner goes the spoils after all."
ENG_their_inevitable_loss_desc:0 "The polls look good, Thatcher is in the lead for preferred Prime Minister over Maudling and Chesterton by an extremely satisfying series of numbers. Oh how the fascists and the fools must be gnashing their teeth at what they see coming to fruit before them. The Royal Party has led this nation for decades, what could they possibly hope to achieve that might outdo our own accomplishments?\n\nVictory is just a matter of time, and on that fateful day we will proceed without the hindrance of reformists or the bull headed refusal to adapt of the hardliners. England will tread a moderate path under Thatcher, so long as dear Margaret remembers who she answers to in the end. "
ENG_its_all_against_you_thatcher_desc:0 "England was saved by the Royal Party from destruction all those years ago, it is true. However, in their position of power, what was once a noble party has given into petty greed and corruption. Harold Macmillan and Reginald Maudling saw this, and though they tried to convince the Royal Party to change its ways, it would not. So United England was formed to reform England into what it used to be. A land of freedom, of justice, and of true democracy.\n\nThatcher will be defeated, the Royal Party thrust from power by the will of the people, and England will finally be rid of those who oppose the democratic process. Maudling will lead this change, and Macmillan will be in the background making sure people get the message right."
ENG_united_england_the_best_choice_desc:0 "United England is more than a mere attempt to replace the Royal Party, it is a movement to supersede its very existence in every way. Let us show the people of England this not through words but through deeds. Having our members rebuild houses and roads, find families for the orphans, and homes for the homeless, we will prove ourselves to be better connected with the English people than the aristocratic Royal Party.\n\nWe will have votes from the farmer and the factory worker, from the postman and the constable and every working man and woman who has been done wrong by our former friends. Let us right the injustice, and let us correct the errors made by those who care not for the normal Englishman."
ENG_rotten_royal_party_desc:0 "We have successfully brought more than a third of the former Royal Party over to our way of seeing things. Why not go for more? Oh, to be sure, they might not be the most democratically inclined of folks, but Macmillan has a certain way with people which might disabuse them of trying anything untoward. They can get in line with the future of England or they can risk the consequences.\n\nWe need the appearance of broad support in order to stand a chance against the entrenched apparatus of the Royal Party, and who better to help with this than former members of the Royal Party? For those unwilling to see the truth of democracy of course, we can always promise looking the other way about some of their past discretions."
ENG_the_mans_insane_desc:0 "The mere idea that English politics tolerate a literal fascist standing for any parliamentary seat is an outrage of the highest order. It was the fascists who destroyed the United Kingdom, it was the fascists who bombed our homes and salted our fields. We should be hanging Chesterton and all his friends from the nearest belfry, not tolerating their existence in politics.\n\nBut we are a civilised people, we will take our case to the general populace on the matter of Arthur Kenneth Chesterton. Let us examine his every decision, his every act of treachery to the fair people of England. Let us let United England be the ones to show the entire nation his depraved and evil true self. This might not be the most strategic of decisions, but all agree it is what needs to be done if England ever hopes to be a true democracy once again."
ENG_lets_battle_it_out_desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is an utter imbecile. An embarrassment to the very fabric of reasonable English politics. Yet, he has a singular use that will have us tolerate his existence for now. He shares a pool of votes with Margaret Thatcher, that being the far right who would never vote for United England in the first place but might well not vote for Thatcher either.\n\nIf Chesterton is taken out of the political framework too early then he might not get a chance to siphon these votes. We have nothing to worry about, after all he'll never win on his own. We will get to the matter of his fate in the long run, but for now we will just let him be and prepare our options. We are, after all, a civilised people, unlike him."
ENG_a_risky_risky_bet_desc:0 "United England has a greater purpose than merely overthrowing the Royal Party, we seek to restore democracy as well. That cannot always be done by honest tactics, hence why Macmillan and Maudling have amassed some funds for a somewhat nefarious act that will serve a pure goal.\n\nTo put it bluntly, we don't have the political framework the Royal Party enjoys and without friends in all levels of society, United England faces an insurmountable challenge. Many people will side with us, because they do not share our cause, so we will pay them to hear us out. Even if we just get a few hundred friendly faces it will all be worth it, for what is more important in an election than having the voters trust on your side?"
ENG_get_the_money_ready_desc:0 "The Royal Party is fragmenting, falling apart under its own grotesque corruption and weight. Why not seize this opportunity to try and get an outright majority of the former Royal Party MP's inside United England? It would immensely aid our efforts to secure influence, and speed along some of our programmes very nicely.\n\nThere is a risk to this plan. United England attracts voters who want reform and change, so having most of our party be people once affiliated with the moderate RP who mismanaged the country so badly will not do our public perception any favours, to say nothing of what ammunition it might give the opposition. As with all things it is a question of balance - should we risk it, or try something more subtle?"
ENG_midlands_and_only_the_midlands_desc:0 "Amidst the factories and rolling fields of the Midlands lies a great opportunity for United England to secure the election firmly. The Midlands are populous, and unlike the South they might be persuaded to vote for us, not the Royal Party. A concentrated and thorough campaign in the region will give us an outright majority of seats, provided nothing goes wrong, and the Royal Party knows it. Wasting their resources trying to defeat us here rather than aiming for the North will be their downfall.\n\nThe Midlands also represented some of the core HMMLR support back in the Civil War, and the people still remember the names of Bill Alexander and David Stirling with glee in the dark alleys. We might, covertly, promise to keep the idealistic part of that legacy alive."
ENG_northern_english_voting_treasure_desc:0 "The English North is the core of United England, filled with anti-London sentiments which have provided the backbone for our party's growth. If the Royal Party were to oust us here, we would not stand a chance of winning the election. That is why we must guard our seats here carefully. The Midlands are likely not going to vote for us anyway, but should the North falter then we will face a problem not even a miracle might reverse.\n\nLess publicly, the North was the core of HMMLR support, and though misguided we can use these attitudes to serve our own vision of English democracy, so long as we aren't too obvious about appealing to that demographic that is."
ENG_whats_left_to_sort_out_desc:0 "The polls don't lie, Reginald Maudling is the most popular candidate for Prime Minister by a margin greater than Alec Douglas-Home's first ministry, a proper achievement in and of itself. With the election just weeks away we now face the problem of what might do following our victory.\n\nReform is a dangerous word, but Macmillan wants to restore the English democracy no matter what, and to hell with those who suggest we ought to keep some of the Royal Party's corruption around for our own ends. Let the National Front and the Royal Party squabble for the scraps of influence they have left, we will outlast them and leave them in the dustbin of history. Democracy is England's birthright, and we shall deliver."

FEN_a_forgotten_word_england_desc:0 "Freedom, a word the former traitor government would have rather preferred to be unmentioned for the rest of time. Freedom is not simply a word however, it is a state of mind, one that pushes the greatest of men into actions considered impossible. Monarchists and communists, soldiers and labourers and churchmen all worked together not because of force or fear. They fought as one because they would rather die free than live oppressed under the traitor's boots.\n\nHMMLR is victorious, and England is now free of the rule of those who betrayed it to the fascists decades ago. We have won, and from Dover to Carlisle it is the banner of a Free England which flies. We did this not for personal glory, but so that the children born in this land will never again have to witness the jackboot of the Reich."
FEN_assembly_of_heroes_desc:0 "Now that the struggle is won, HMMLR will have to deal with the aftermath. With so many figures in the Collaborationist government refusing to defect it leaves England with something of a deficit of civilian leadership not tied to HMMLR directly. Thus HMMLR must take up the responsibility of planning the nations future, especially the free elections promised so often in our pleas to the people. A meeting will be necessary for this.\n\nClaude Auchinleck, the leader of HMMLR who united men from every facet of society under him. Bill Alexander, the Red General who put aside his own misgivings with HMMLR to free England from fascism. David Stirling, the Mad General who never stopped fighting, no matter the cost. These men and others will determine the future of our nation."
FEN_urgent_matters_first_desc:0 "Whilst having a debate about the merits of bringing back the institution of the monarchy in a forum filled with ardent monarchists, republicans and outright communists would be fascinating, it might also take several hundred years. There are a thousand minor political differences between the assorted factions of HMMLR, but none of them matter now. We can decide on purely political problems once elections are done and the English people have chosen.\n\nFor the moment our chief goal should be repairing the damage inflicted upon our country by the Civil War, either through reckless action on our part or sadistic spite from traitor formations. There are a thousand and one matters which take place over politics, and the provisional government must be focused on those issues alone."
FEN_a_responsible_political_system_desc:0 "HMMLR is a diverse organisation, one made of promises and compromise rather than any definite political ideology. But with new elections being held members of HMMLR are in many cases the natural choices to represent or even become leaders in the new political landscape. But Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander are unwilling to lead their former followers personally, and have instead agreed to support the creation of new civilian led parties.\n\nBill Alexander seeks to draw his own old CPGB, the Labour Underground and the myriad of smaller leftist parties that made up the Left Resistance into the Socialist Labour Party. Whilst Claude Auchinleck looks to convince the establishment, liberal and former conservative party members who opposed the Collaborationist government into a National Democratic League."
FEN_the_young_democracy_law_desc:0 "Nothing is more threatening to a fledgling state than its first steps. Be it ambitious military officers or politicians seeking to make new opportunities for personal gain it is always at the beginning that a state is most vulnerable to falling from its path. Auchinleck and Alexander are well aware of this, and more importantly both are well aware of the possible consequences of any part of HMMLR trying to subvert the democratic process.\n\nThus the Young Democracy Law has been proposed, which will give authority to a select council of HMMLR veterans to, during the formative years of this resurrected democracy, suspend that democracy for the good of the English people if need be. Only with the mutual agreement of both Auchinleck and Alexander can this law be enacted, and only against a threat using the guise of democracy to end or pervert it, or the collapse of democratic institutions leaving England with good governance."
FEN_undoing_their_evils_desc:0 "England is wounded, none can deny that our land is a shattered remnant of what it once was. The Civil War caused much destruction it is true, tens of thousands of needless deaths and entire towns left broken by shells and gunfire. Yet the Collaborationist government did a great deal of damage in their rule as well, damage far harder to heal. Our academics were hunted or forced to toe the government line, the unions of workers beaten into submission or forced underground altogether. To say nothing of the political persecution of opposition parties.\n\nIt now falls to HMMLR to repair this damage, to undo what went wrong and give the people a glimmer of hope that the future we promised will be worth the wait. Be we soldiers of Stirling, Alexander or Auchinleck, we owe our countrymen that at least."
FEN_begin_demobilization_desc:0 "The struggle of liberation was one undertaken by a good many tens of thousands of loyal Englishmen. From villages and factories, dockyards and farms they came. Men and boys and even women who all knew that the evils of fascism and totalitarianism had to be expunged from our nation whatever the cost.\n\nThe top ranks have spoken and it's been agreed that now that the struggle is over, it's time for most of our men to return home. Let them trade guns for hammers and rakes and ploughshares, let them return to normalcy. A professional core of HMMLR fighters will stay on of course but they will exist to form the backbone of the future English army, not to oppress the people they are supposed to protect like the Traitor forces had done."
FEN_clearing_unexploded_ordinance_desc:0 "War's are not accurate affairs. As often as not a shell or bomb will miss its target entirely, and with significant fighting in urban and rural areas of England alike we now face the unfortunate problem of numerous explosive devices including actual landmines which, for one reason or another failed to detonate as they were intended to.\n\nUsing an all volunteer force, Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander have catalogued the areas with the highest number of unexploded munitions and sent demining crews in to, slowly, solve the problem. This might well take years to effect fully, and it is entirely possible that England will never be 100 percent free of explosive refuse, but it will be an improvement for our people."
FEN_life_begins_anew_desc:0 "HMMLR is a volunteer force, we had no need to conscript when the vast majority of our fighters were militiamen or defecting soldiers. Alas but being a volunteer does not insulate our soldiers from the effects of combat. Shellshock is rampant amongst those units which spent a great deal of time on the front lines, especially the militia formations which bore the brunt of much of the fighting. Many who fought for our cause lost limbs, senses and even family members when brother fought brother amidst the chaos. We owe them more than mere words can convey.\n\nWe shall do our best to ensure nobody who sacrificed something dear to their person for a Free England will be forgotten, and that those who sacrificed everything shall be remembered forever."
FEN_start_reconstruction_desc:0 "With much of the civilian leadership rendered unable to assist us due to their siding with the Collaborationist Government and what civilian apparatus we do possess mostly being limited to the more local positions, it had been decided that the reconstruction of England will take place under military authority.\n\nA series of Reconstruction Commands each covering a distinct region of England shall govern the rebuilding process, deciding on the priorities to be given for specific issues and acting as a temporary judicial and governing branch for the Provisional Government. Needless to say these will be influential positions, and whoever holds them may affect the popularity of the nascent political parties in the upcoming elections."
FEN_expand_the_reconstruction_command_desc:0 "Reconstruction is an arduous process and it falls to the Provisional Government to ensure that it gets off to a good start before whichever party wins the upcoming elections finishes it. To aid in the process, the higher ups have delegated certain military and irregular formations to each of the reconstruction zones to assist in the repair and rebuilding of infrastructure, housing and the problems associated therein.\n\nConsequently, with the Reconstruction Authorities becoming ever more influential in English society so too will the influence they hold on the future elections increase. We must take care to ensure these temporary authorities don't outstay their welcome and make provisions to dismantle them once a civilian government is available."
FEN_HMMLR_is_law_desc:0 "The police, prison and judicial systems were some of the Collaborationist Government's foremost tools to use against groups seeking the return of democracy to England, and even now we face the problem of compensating for the fact that many of their ranking members are awaiting trial for treason in one form or another.\n\nClaude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander have thus authorised for the Reconstruction Authorities to take over the duties of acting as police, internment and legal authorities until such time as all relevant systems can be reestablished. Former fighters might not make the best police, but at least we can trust that we share common cause with them."
FEN_register_the_voters_desc:0 "The coming elections will be the most important in the history of England, a return to a true and interfering democracy for the first time in over two decades. But democracy requires voters, and voter suppression was one of the main ways the Royal Party kept their traitorous grip upon power intact.\n\nAuchinleck and Alexander don't always agree on everything, but both agree that the first step to a real and functioning democracy is having as many voters as possible. To give the election a sense of legitimacy the Collaborationist government never could, and to give the ordinary Englishman a chance to show his support for our liberation. Let the light shine upon democracy unshackled, and let the traitors see exactly what it was that they feared put into action once again. The choice of the ordinary man."
FEN_feed_our_hungry_desc:0 "The Collaborationist forces had the regrettable habit of confiscating food supplies from villages and towns where they believed the populace to be against them. Combined with the food shortages from all the burnt fields and destroyed stocks of grain and if we aren't careful there might be a famine on our hands.\n\nLuckily the yanks have been generous enough to send over what aid they can, combined with generous rationing on goods in short supply and it should be enough to tide England over until the next harvest. We can use HMMLR members to hand out the rations, that ought to keep the people in good order at least. Still, some efforts to keep an eye on those in charge of rationing might not hurt."
FEN_what_of_the_young_desc:0 "Orphans are always a problem in war, no matter the conflict men and women will die and their children will be forced to face the world without them. The reprisal policies some of the fascist militias engaged in have produced many orphans, to say nothing of what happened when they shelled urban areas in efforts to root out our fighters.\n\nSadly our own victories were not free of loss either, we must take responsibility for the children of all those slain in this civil war and act to give them a better future. Orphanages and work programs for orphans leaving them will be a vital part of the post war reality in England, it is up to us to ensure they work as intended. We will also encourage adoptions where possible, to give some of them the chance of a normal life."
FEN_assume_the_civillian_administration_desc:0 "The average post office in post-civil war England is located in a wonderful neighborhood and is surrounded by a variety of pleasing aesthetics, it is also on average bombed to smithereens. It turns out that the local post office makes a frighteningly good command post for the local militia. For that matter most of the postmen are also bombed to smithereens, poor bastards were amongst the first to be conscripted.\n\nNow in regards to solving this the Reconstruction Command's have had to create and staff their own post offices, and whilst those manning them are somewhat less friendly and more inclined to prolific facial hair than the traditional postmen they are nonetheless doing their all to return England to a state of normality."
FEN_from_rifles_to_shovels_desc:0 "Whilst HMMLR has made significant use of soldiers to man previously civil affairs until normal governance has been restored, the Reconstruction Commands have only made limited use of soldiers as a rebuilding force. Still there is a first time for everything, and now it falls to the Reconstruction Command's to designate towns, cities and roads which are in need of clearing and repair.\n\nIt might be a crude solution and for certain a proper rebuilding will require years of dedicated reconstruction but as a stop gap measure this will do. Let the men and women who saved English democracy put down the weapons of war for the symbols of peace, let them enjoy their victory by having them build what is to come."
FEN_the_english_phoenix_desc:0 "The scars are still present on the English landscape and the English soul, but thanks to the Reconstruction Commands they are scars rather than open wounds. The process of healing won't be able to fully get onto its feet until the people have elect a new government, but nobody would be lying if they said the Command's did a damn good job with what they had.\n\nFrom the ashes of oppression and war a new England rises. An England without the shackles of totalitarianism, without the vultures of fascism picking at its bones. From here and forever it is a Free England which shall govern this land. Governed by the people, of the people and for the people. Not for the tyrant in Germania, and a curse upon his house. Let him know that the fire of freedom rises."
FEN_the_oxford_trials_1_desc:0 "The matter of what to do with the officials and military members of the Collaborationist regime has been a hotly debated subject. The Left Resistance, HMMLR proper and Stirling's faction all having disagreements on the fates of the accused and indeed on many groups of people as a whole.\n\nA solution as agreed to by Auchinleck, Stirling and Alexander is to hold a series of public trials for the most notorious Collaborators. So that our people and the world will know that this government is not the same as that which it replaced. That it values justice, and not mere revenge out of hand. They may be guilty to a one, but the traitors will receive a fair trial for their sins."
FEN_their_castle_burns_desc:0 "Ah the traitors, well see before they actually get to trial they're going to have to survive until the trial starts. Many people, Stirling himself included are quite annoyed that we're even having to go through with all this trial nonsense to begin with to be quite frank. Alas but the Boss and that killjoy Bill Alexander are adamant that we can't just haul them off somewhere and make the whole affair five minutes long.\n\nOf course there is some leeway over where they get held. We could go the old fashioned route and use one of the nearby castles to detain the traitors of course but if some of us were feeling ungenerous we could also hold them in an ordinary neighbourhood, close to their victims. Camouflage see, and of course if some were to go missing whilst there well, that would just be a shame."
FEN_increment_security_desc:0 "The reactionary fascists are being held in custody until such time as their crimes can be listed and evidence gathered. Also there needs to be some preparation of the trial grounds themselves in Oxford University, temporarily converted to the local headquarters for HMMLR.\n\nWe can't be seen to use soldiers at what is nominally a civilian trial so it falls to the decision of rehiring some police to act as trial guards, trustworthy ones only of course, or whether we could summon up some of our revolutionary comrades to handle security matters. We'd need to keep them in check of course but who better to ensure that the reactionaries get the justice they deserve?"
FEN_chose_the_prosecutor_desc:0 "Part of this whole civil \"justice\" stuff according to Stirling is the actual part of separating the business of who's guilty and who only looks like a filthy traitor by association. But Stirling's got word from the Boss that prosecutor is needed, and fast. We could probably find one of those types by looking around HMMLR proper, God knows they're a stuffy bunch.\n\nAlternatively, we might throw a bone to the reds. We couldn't be accused of conspiring anything if we gave the job to one of theirs but it would be an awful shame if that fellow went overboard in the charges. For the traitors that is. Or we could just ensure justice is meted out, one our lads would do the job fine i'm sure."
FEN_and_the_judge_desc:0 "As part of the general liberation of England from fascist oppression there needs to be a set precedence of fair and impartial justice to wipe away the stain of inequality riven into the heart of the reactionary system of courts. Claude Auchinleck trust comrade Alexander to deal with, and find an impartial judge to deal with the matter.\n\nA member of the Left Resistance would be ideal of course, to ensure those who hunted our fellow's like dogs back in the Uprising of 1953 get the justice in sore need of meting out, but that might open up our swiftly forming Socialist Labour Party to criticism. We could also choose a justice affiliated with HMMLR proper but they have always been somewhat squeamish. Or we could abandon even the pretense of subtly and nominate one of Stirling's men. It would get the job done at least."
FEN_enemies_of_the_nation_desc:0 "We didn't capture all the Colaborationist officials unfortunately, some are still in hiding or on the run all across England. If they flee into neighbouring countries or worse, across the Channel we may well never see them again. We cannot rely upon manhunts of ordinary soldiers no, this will require some expert help.\n\nKim Philby, one of our main agents in the Collaborationist government once upon a time and now head of the reconstituted intelligence services aims to capture the traitors by deception. Faking escape routes, using personal connections from agents he helped to defect to entrap the unwary, even outright blackmailing their families into revealing their hiding places. Or we could just send Stirling after them. That might work."
FEN_access_of_the_press_desc:0 "We really ought to consider the level of access given to the press in this whole affair. Too much of a good thing as the saying goes, if we give unrestricted access and ability to record events as they occur it could lead to some bad publicity, yet on the same grounds not allowing this could be interpreted as censorship.\n\nBill Alexander and Stirling advise that the press be limited in what they can record in some fashion, mainly to protect witnesses yet Auchinleck himself favours a more open approach. In the end a decision needs to be made and it falls to the three most powerful men in England to make it."
FEN_the_reformist_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan. The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of His Majesty's Exchequer. And the head of the reformist wing of the Royal Party. Well known for his stance towards softening the collaborationist government and allowing a larger degree of freedom, his convictions apparently were not enough to overcome the fear of German intervention. And now, he awaits punishment for being a wartime minister in Douglas-Home's cabinet.\n\nMacmillan is not like the other prominent defendants of the cabinet, however. Unlike Home, he has never been in a position where he was responsible for the horrible crimes of the government. And unlike Chesterton, he is not a terrible and shameless individual who truly believed in the objective right of what he was doing. Perhaps that will allow him to avoid their fates. Perhaps not. We shall see..."
FEN_the_liberal_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling. By the accounts of those who knew him, he should not have joined the collaborationists at all. One of the most prominent voices against the government while in Parliament, many of similar beliefs joined HMMLR when the war broke out. Yet, he betrayed them all and stayed with the collabs. Now, he is brought before us to defend his decision.\n\nThis is easily the most controversial of the defendants we tried, however. Aside from the aforementioned break with his colleagues and friends, he hasn't done anything particularly interesting after that. Some still want to punish him. Others argue what he did does not warrant him being brought before a court for murderers and traitors at all. Let us hear the evidence before we make a final decision."
FEN_the_traitor_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery. If he had died in the invasion, he would be forever remembered as a hero. If he had refused service with the collaborators, he might still be. If he had joined with HMMLR, he would have had a chance at redemption. And yet...here he is.\n\nThe case is clear cut. He was in charge of the collaborationist army, and everything the army did could be blamed on him. However, he still has conducted actions in his past that were admirable, and there remains a not-insignificant amount of respect for him amongst Claude and his supporters. Might it be worth it to temper justice with mercy?"
FEN_the_rabid_dogs_desc:0 "Templer. Carver. Gibbs. Baker. Their names are numerous, but there is one thing that unites them all. They were commissioned generals in the collaborationist army. And now, we have to judge them for the atrocities committed under their commands.\n\nThey have no future in our army, that much is clear. But how far do we want to punish them? Some are arguing that only blood can answer for blood, but others are arguing that a violent retaliation against these men is not who we are, and that more proportionate punishments should be considered."
FEN_the_head_of_the_snake_desc:0 "Alec Douglas-Home. The longest serving Prime Minister in the history of collaborationist England. But while his electoral strength still remains undefeated, his tenure was ended by the free peoples he had tried to submit. Now, we shall bring him before the court to defend himself.\n\nHe is accused of every injustice, every violation, every misery suffered by the English people during this war. Every order, every action, every inaction can be traced to him and him alone. We intend to make him answer for every one of those crimes. And prosecute the leader of the collaborationists to the fullest extent for the crimes committed under his command."
FEN_the_bootlicker_desc:0 "Arthur Chesterton. If there was a man more reviled in all of England, hated by both rebels and collaborators alike, we have yet to find him. A fascist demagogue so low he could walk under a dachshund's belly, the head of the collaborationist secret police, and the head of a Blackshirt paramilitary group during the war. Certainly, he has an enormous amount to answer for, though we will try to be fair to him. As fair as one can be when looking at an individual as heinous as Chesterton is."
FEN_the_gavel_strikes_desc:0 "It is done, the Oxford trials have concluded and now we merely await the sentence. Throughout these trials we have seen the very worst the Collaborationist Government and its military dogs had to offer. We have heard tell of countless crimes and even more horrific goings on in the dark underbelly of the Collaborationist Regime, but the sentence shall apportion guilt only to those deserving.\n\nOur actions beforehand could well have affected the outcome significantly, we can only hope that the international community sees the trials as just or at least fair. If not, we may have made a miscalculation."
FEN_citizenship_reborn_desc:0 "One man one vote, though now that women can vote as well the saying might need to be updated somewhat. One person one vote doesn't quite run off the tongue so well. Either way, the National Democratic League and the Socialist Labour Party now prepare to face off in the first demcoratic election held on English soil in two decades.\n\nAt stake is the future of the monarchy, the economy and the reconstruction process. As well the assorted reforms each party says they will or won't enact. But it shan't be some shady council of military men who decide how this happens, it shall be the people. And the people alone. This is what we fought for, a free and independent England. Let us enjoy it whilst we can."
FEN_corner_stone_democracy_desc:0 "For years, England was the main force behind freedom and democracy throughout the globe. The entire might of our nation ensured the world would always stand against despots and would-be world conquerors. But today, our system is broken, and England is controlled by an emergency military dictatorship. We must restore democracy as soon as possible to make good on our promises to the population, and to show we really are going to create a free and democratic England."
FEN_Guiding_hand_desc:0 "Every revolution has its heroes. Ones who risked their lives and freedom to create a better world. But now the revolution is over. And what role should those heroes take now?\n\nBill Alexander, Claude Auchinleck, and David Stirling have all certainly done their parts in this battle. But the next phase is approaching, and they certainly don't wish to stick around too long and overstay their welcome. They will meet to decide how best to use their status in order to aid the revolution."
FEN_Restoring_Trust_desc:0 "Years of being governed by a supposed democracy that disenfranchised the majority of the population and ruthlessly targeted any dissident has left the population extremely jaded about Democracy. The general triumph of dictators over the democratic nations has also left people a bit pessimistic about our government. We'll tell them exactly why that's wrong.\n\nWhat we experienced was merely a Reichskommissariat with a facade thrown over to try and give it an air of legitimacy. Our government will be a true democracy, and will not make the mistakes as the ones in the past."
FEN_from_ash_desc:0 "Rivers clogged with the remains of bridges. Shells of factories being lived in by hundreds of homeless people. Vast fields of burnt wheat, trampled on by men and machines. Block after block of collapsed brick piles where homes once stood. Bombs and unexploded shells being discovered every day. England is a land destroyed, a land broken beyond use. But we shall rebuild it. To make the England one remembers, and to make an England that will lead one into the future."
FEN_To_Roads_desc:0 "England has long known the importance of solid infrastructure. The Romans laid solid, paved roads that we still use today. Our canals made us an industrial power, and our railroads brought much of the world into a more enlightened age. Now, we are mired in poverty, and our roads are destroyed. One may draw a conclusion from this.\n\nEngland's roads will be rebuilt. Broad highways will link our nation together. Trucks and cars will have smooth, well built paths to any area they wish to go. And with the proper framework in place, we can begin our industrial reconstruction."
FEN_Rebuilding_the_System_desc:0 "England's economy does not work. In fact, it hasn't worked for many years. Many of it is merely the result of massive destruction and carnage from the two massive wars on the island. But there are a few things that just don't work, and we'll be prepared to replace all of it. Taxes, regulations, jobs, industries, everything will be rebuilt. And if we know that it won't work, we'll reform it and put in something that will. England will be prosperous again, and we're going to do anything to make that happen."
FEN_To_The_People_desc:0 "One must not forget why we're doing all this. Not for some narcissistic desire to have our nation achieve some arbitrary definition of \"greatness\". Not for the sole wish to have the collabs and traitors suffer. We are doing this for the people of England. They do not deserve what was inflicted upon them by the Germans and their Quisling lackeys. They deserve to have the say in how things are done, and they deserve to have a decent and happy life. We will remember this, and make it clear where our priorities lie."
FEN_Bread_and_What_desc:0 "At long last, the hunger plaguing the nation is beginning to subside. Our efforts have been successful, and we soon won't have a problem like that anymore. So what do we put our efforts into with the leftover cash?\n\nWelfare is a good option, since many still have other issues aside from hunger. A strong democratic system would require some extra cash as well. Or we could just spend it on the army and ensure another humiliation like this will not happen again."
FEN_To_The_Army_desc:0 "Our military accomplished what it set out to do. It defeated the collaborators and set in place a new system of government that will help the people of England. But in its new role? It is not as adept as it should be. It must be reformed, and we will begin to make the necessary decisions to shape the military in the way we want."
FEN_where_to_send_the_rest_desc:0 "The army has thousands of extra soldiers. Regulars, local militias, and reservist groups. Some say this is too much. They say they could be doing much more useful work in other places. Things like rebuilding our nation, repairing factories, repaving roads, that sort of thing. This is an interesting proposal, and we have to consider the possibility that our forces could be more effectively utilized in other ways."

ENG_an_unfortunate_reality_desc:0 "Since we are now a part of the OFN, we can no longer entice German investment and support. We must embrace them, we have simply become too dependent on the US. The Germans are not willing to come anywhere near us.\n\nEven Thatcher has allowed her hopes to subside. Britain can no longer be a Superpower, we will have to accept that we now exist in the shadow of the USA. At least we are free of the Germans."
ENG_the_road_to_washington_desc:0 "America's dominance over the United Kingdom has now been accepted, Thatcher has decided to send Pym on a diplomatic mission to Wasington to talk to the Americans about our new relationship. Our embassy there will need to be expanded as relations with the Americans become more intimate. It has become obvious that Britain is no longer entirely in control of its relations with the United States."
ENG_share_our_technology_desc:0 "Technology is to become an important base for our new relationship with the United States. Regrettably we will have to send some of our technical developments to them in return, since we are no longer in the position we once were. However, the additional improvements to our Industry and Jets will be welcome. Perhaps American dominance will not be all that bad."
ENG_an_ofn-sided_trade_deal_desc:0 "With the Germans out of the picture the US knows we no longer have any leverage over them. Losing the protections that we had in the past will be very damaging to our government's reputation, but we will have to swallow our pride as the country desperately needs a trade deal with the Americans. We no longer have a say in such matters. Sadly, we are going to give up several concessions to preserve our economy."
ENG_bases_on_britain_desc:0 "We will allow the Americans to set up military bases on British soil, their army will now help protect our shores from German forces.\n\nThis is exactly what the Germans have always feared would happen, they will be put right on edge once this news reaches their leadership. They will likely see the Americans as a grave threat and will want to retaliate in a way they can.\n\nAt least the Americans are here to protect us now."
ENG_americas_airstrip_desc:0 "The United States is keen to position its air force on our island, the proximity of our bases to Germany will be very advantageous to the American military. They will have the access they require, we will serve them; becoming their unsinkable aircraft carrier.\n\nThere is nothing for us to gain from this besides US protection. We can only wish that they will see us as an intimate ally; rather than nothing more than an airstrip."
ENG_a_diplomatic_1943_desc:0 "Worryingly little seems to have changed since the civil war. England is back under the German sphere of influence and our government is likely to be diminished to little more than the puppet that it was before the war. Bormann is also unlikely to be too forgiving of our recent actions, it is as if we have been invaded by the Germans once again.\n\nThatcher has failed the United Kingdom and life under Bormann is only going to make this failure sting more as time goes by."
ENG_a_line_on_the_north_sea_desc:0 "A new maritime border with Germany will have to be drawn. Concessions will have to be made to the Germans and they will not be concerned with how their might affect us. There is no doubt that we will lose most of our access to the North Sea; along with most of its resources and wealth. We have to hope that everything we surrender to the Germans will satisfy them in the future."
ENG_surrender_the_oil_desc:0 "Sadly the oil under the North Sea will have to be part of our concession to the Germans. We have little choice but to give the Germans almost exclusive drilling access within the region. We will lose almost all of our oil fields and our economy will suffer as a result.\n\nThis choice is taken because it is a necessity, if we did not give the oil to them they would just take it, this way it is on our terms."
ENG_north_sea_naval_exercises_desc:0 "The Germans have become increasingly enthusiastic for the Royal Navy and the Kreigsmarine to take part in a joint exercise in the North Sea. The war games will take place shortly, it will likely be odd for our sailors to train alongside the Germans they have prepared to fight against not too long ago. But this will just have to be a part of their encroaching influence into our military."
ENG_give_them_access_to_scapa_flow_desc:0 "Scapa Flow is believed to be one of the greatest naval bases on earth, it has been a source of great pride for the Royal Navy ever since it became a base for the British Grand Fleet. But our navy has long since been sunk to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe port will now have to be relinquished to the Germans, they will get more use of it than we would have; they still have a powerful navy after all.\n\nYet another concession has to be made to the Germans, each one is sad, but necessary."
ENG_a_dream_forever_crushed_desc:0 "There was a time, not too long ago, when we thought it would be possible for England to rid the British Isles of German influence. Alas this was not meant to be, the Hun have returned to reassert their control over us. England is back where it started, under the German thumb. Britain will never become a superpower, let alone great, under Thatcher. Our government will not even be sovereign, we have lost everything and are set to gain pitifully little.\n\nIt seems as if England is doomed to live under the Germans for many more painful years."
ENG_bedfellows_with_the_devil_desc:0 "England is back under the control of the Germans, we have allowed them to have far too much influence. The United States no longer wishes to deal with us, our only option that we have left is to join them. This situation has become far from ideal, but at least with Germany under Speer, Britain may yet retain a degree of its own sovereignty.\n\nHowever England will now only become a shadow of what it could have been."
ENG_relax_trade_barriers_desc:0 "Numerous barriers to trade between Great Britain and Germany still exist; the German have requested that they be cut down as quickly as possible. Many tariffs and embargoes are to be lifted, without them conducting business between our two nations will become much easier. The immediate effects of this may benefit them more than it helps us, but it could very well assist our economy in the long run."
ENG_reject_the_ultimate_humiliation_desc:0 "Lately the Germans have set up a Pan European economic project known as the 'Zollverein'. This is nothing short of economic imperialism, created by the Germans as a tool to exploit the resources of the other members of the project.\n\nGreat Britain has absolutely no intentions of joining such a thing. Thatcher has already been distrustful of the continentals and despite her weakened position will never allow the Germans to ravage her country. There is no doubt that we will reject joining this, showing that we clearly still hold on to a shred of our former dignity."
ENG_the_germans_in_london_desc:0 "A new ambassador is to be sent to London from Germania, he will likely be stationed in a place where he can keep an eye on our government. Thatcher is to meet with the ambassador, even if she is reluctant to do so. The Prime Minister is also expected to congratulate him on the beginning of a new era of Anglo-German relations.\n\nIt is not going to be an era that will see the rise of Britain, the time and for that has been and gone; we will have to work if what we have from here on out."
ENG_german_technicians_desc:0 "Germany is to send over a group of technicians to help modernise our ineffectual industry, which still suffers from the damage of the Civil War. They will be welcomed, because even though they may be Germans, we can still use their expertise. Our factories need the support and we will appreciate their help in getting our economy back on its feet."
ENG_partners_with_the_hun_desc:0 "We are not subservient to the Germans. At least not as much as the rest of Europe, we are considered to be closer to partners than puppets. They may be many times more powerful than we are, but some still like to think that we continue to hold our own against the Europeans.\n\nHowever our economy is still dependent on their support. It is highly unlikely that we will ever be completely free of German influence."
ENG_the_welsh_issue_desc:0 "The simple fact that Wales is separate from the rest of England undermines our government in the eyes of the rest of the world. The government there has set up an illegitimate that has no reason to exist; therefore it must be brought back under the control of Westminster. We will deal with them swiftly and resolutely. They will not block us from reclaiming our right to greatness"
ENG_mobilize_the_reserves_desc:0 "Even though Wales is a small minor power, with a small minor military protecting it, we will still need more manpower in order to overwhelm them. Mobilizing our reserves will let us have enough troops to defeat the Welsh scourge. It may be an overly extreme move, but we can not let them have a chance at defeating us, or we will be humiliated for the rest of history."
ENG_a_show_of_force_desc:0 "Before we cross the border into Wales to reassume control over their territory, we will demonstrate our military might to their faces. Every Welsh Border Guard will hear the echoes of our artillery that will shortly be turned on them. Having flexed our armies muscles there will be no doubt in their minds of what will come next. We will attack rapidly and they will be too scared to even lift a finger to defend themselves."
ENG_increase_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 "As we are starting to become more connected internationally we will need to expand the size of our Foreign Ministry. More diplomats are required to negotiate overseas on the government's behalf, this will lay sufficient groundwork for future diplomatic actions. After Wales has been dealt with, we will be able to make sure our international presence is felt."
ENG_expand_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 ""
ENG_solve_the_welsh_issue_desc:0 "We have already made all the necessary preparations for an invasion of Wales, our army stands ready at the border and ready for battle. Now it is the time to negotiate with the Welsh where we will mercifully offer them a peaceful solution to their treachery.\n\nIf they dare to refuse us then they will get what they deserve."
ENG_the_south_united_desc:0 "The first confrontation in the reunification of our isle has been won, as Wales has been conquered. The English people have become reinvigorated by the government's success and are ardently waiting for our next triumph. There is much work left to be done but Thatcher will doubtlessly make sure that it is done.\n\nLong live England, soon to be the United Kingdom."
ENG_the_fortress_up_north_desc:0 "There is one last obstacle in the way of restoring the United Kingdom, it is our ancient rival, Scotland. If our dealings with Wales is anything to go by, they should fall under our authority soon.\n\nHowever they will prove to be quite an indomitable foe. They have spent years apprehensively preparing to defend their republic. The border is heavily fortified, if no peaceful settlement is found, the resulting war will be the bloodiest in the history of the British Isles."
ENG_contact_pro-unionist_officers_desc:0 "In spite of the Scottish government's vigorous efforts to defend their nation, they have overlooked the swathes of pro-unionist soldiers that existed amidst their armies ranks. Once they have been contacted by MI6, they will be very useful in bringing down the Republic from within. And if the Scotish government refuses to reunify diplomatically, they will explode every fort, every road and every government office that they can. We will make it clear that Scottish security is nothing more than an illusion, their territory will be reintegrated, by any means necessary."
ENG_mountain_warfare_desc:0 "If we are forced into a war we will have to stamp out every Scottish nationalist throughout the land. That will include the rugged, and easily defensible, mountains of the north.\n\nAt the moment, our army is not prepared to fight in such terrain. They will have to be trained to fight amongst the mountains if we are to have a hope of removing the Scottish army entirely."
ENG_we_are_willing_to_negotiate_desc:0 "We do not wish to fight with the people of Scotland. They are almost as ready as we are for war. The battle along the border would be bloody, the havoc inside the cities would be terrifying and the scars that would be left behind would take several lifetimes to fade.\n\nBut, rest assured, they know that we are more than willing to make such sacrifices to restore our once United Kingdom."
ENG_the_welsh_example_desc:0 "Wales has already been retaken and brought back to its proper place within our kingdom and we have gained a great deal of experience from dealing with them. We are ready to use these experiences to better tackle the Scots. Our army is more than willing to occupy them. There will be no time wasted in reuniting with Scotland under the crown."
ENG_bridge_the_gap_desc:0 "Reunification with Scotland is imperative if we are to regain our national prestige, the sooner we start work on their unification, the better. They may be hostile toward us to begin with, but they will quickly learn that we are not going to submit to their demands. The Scots will not remain independent much longer. Scotland has to be reintegrated, no matter the cost."
ENG_the_second_act_of_union_desc:0 "Having dealt with the old government of the Scottish Republic and the Welsh brakeaway, we can begin drafting our proclamation of the reunification of the United Kingdom. Our isle is no longer divided. We are once more united under one king and Margret Thatcher's dream of England once again being relevant on the world stage is closer than ever to being fulfilled, now that she rules Britannia."
ENG_a_necessity_desc:0 "Ever since Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of England, she has had one fundamental goal, the restoration of what she believes is England's rightful place on the world stage. In order to take up this mantle, she believes that Great Britain must first be reunited; this will only be possible with Pakt or OFN assistance. However, before Thatcher can begin to take a more active role in foreign policy she will have to meet with Francis Pym.\n\nDespite being fiercely loyal to her prime ministership, Pym is unlikely to appreciate what he believes is Thatcher's increasingly excessive control of his area of policy."
ENG_our_biggest_threat_desc:0 "Following on from her previous talks with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Thatcher has planned to persuade Pym that the presence of the Cornwall Garrison on English soil is unacceptable.\n\nThe mere existence of the garrison is indeed a grave and constant threat to the future sovereignty of England. If Thatcher is to restore England's independence, she will have to rid herself of the Germans who occupy the isle."
ENG_approaching_the_hun_desc:0 "With Pym sufficiently convinced of the merits of Thatcher's plan, the time has come for him and the Prime Minister to visit Germania together. After their arrival in the German capital, they will have to come to many agreements with the Germans, from trade to future military relations.\n\nA peaceful resolution has already been made with Germany over Cornwall, although tensions still hang over the two countries. These negotiations will not be easy, but they will be essential in placating the Germans."
ENG_visiting_an_old_friend_desc:0 "After the Second World War broke out the United States abandoned England, and doomed us to our German dominated fate. Since then we have constantly avoided reaching out to the Americans, we did not feel like we could truly trust them.\n\nYet the Anglo-American relationship has not always been this cold, after all, we did fight side by side during World War One. By ushering in a new age of Anglo-American friendship and mutual assistance, we will be able to stand taller than ever on the world stage."
ENG_a_place_in_germania_desc:0 "Soon England will be able to send an envoy into Germania to establish a stronger relationship with Germany. This will bring the United Kingdom closer to Germany and solidify its place as their equal, and not as their puppet.\n\nHowever, the choice of ambassador remains to be made. Thatcher will want to push for a more hardline candidate who will not bend to German pressure, but Pym will likely prefer to appoint the ambassador himself. The strain between the two is bound to become much more noticeable."
ENG_what_our_future_shall_hold_desc:0 "Relations with the Germans are still somewhat hostile. We will have to tread carefully if we are to avoid wrecking the progress our two countries have already made. A treaty will have to be signed to help normalize our new relationship. Assuring non-aggression will also be a significant step towards greater cooperation.\n\nHowever much we may distrust them we must remember that they need us as much as we need them."
ENG_we_are_not_afraid_desc:0 "Many years have passed since we were humbled by Germany and forced to suffer underneath them for decades. Thankfully this humiliating part of our past has been left behind, we no longer live in fear of the Cornwall Garrison and stand eye to eye with the Germans.\n\nAt long last England stands independent, and no matter what, it will not be easy for Germany to take that away from us again."
ENG_a_black_or_blue_telephone_desc:0 "Direct communication is a key part of securing long term close relations between states in our increasingly modern age. However, the question remains over which country we should establish this meaningful connection with.\n\nSetting up a telephone line with the US administration would allow our country to cooperate much more closely with the OFN. Helping to cement our trust with those who are part of the free world.\n\nOn the other hand, reestablishing a direct means of talking with the German leadership would help us to reconcile with them.\n\nWhichever side we choose will have much more influence over us"
ENG_german_technical_support_desc:0 "If we were to receive German technical support our industry would be strengthened a great deal. Taking advantage of their support would offer significant improvements to the effectiveness of English industrial production. This move may bring us closer to the Germans, but our country would benefit hugely, regardless of the dangers."
ENG_german_technology_desc:0 "There are many within our government who may still distrust the Germans, but that does not detract from the fact that their technology is some of the best in the world. Their superior tanks and advanced planes are thought to be the main reasons why they triumphed in the Second World War. Although this may just be trumped up German propaganda, our military sorely needs the technological support that Germany is willing to offer."
ENG_american_technical_support_desc:0 "One of the main advantages of using American support is the fact that it is not German. As we still have issues with the Germans it would be better for us to request the support of the US instead. We will nevertheless become more reliant on the Americans, which will set a dangerous president if we wish to continue to remain entirely independent. However we will have to make a choice and many would rather avoid the devil we already know, all too well."
ENG_american_technology_desc:0 "There is no air force on the planet that can be compared to the American's; the United States has the most futuristic fighter jets and helicopters at its disposal. Their modern style of warfare is also very intriguing, even though it is not known if it is totally reliable. If we were to have some of these aircraft in our own air force, the German military would be as fearsome as it currently seems"
ENG_overlooking_washington_desc:0 "Having sown the seeds of our new relationship with the Americans, the time has come for an English ambassador to be sent to Washington. This will mark the first time the US and England have worked together in decades; it may only be an ambassador but it signifies that times are indeed changing. Once the bond with America has been rekindled, England will not be as alone in the world as it has been."
ENG_a_new_special_relationship_desc:0 "Over the course of history, the US and the UK have always been close; sharing a common language and a similar cultural identity. The Prime Minister now seeks to use these similarities to create a new partnership with America, one that suitably reflects the intimacy of our pasts. However Thatcher is unlikely to permit any deal to be too in favor of the US, she would much prefer England to remain in control of its own destiny."
ENG_the_germanian_problem_desc:0 "England may have released herself from Germany's clutches, but we are not completely free. Germany's military power is still immense and if the German leadership were to order another invasion, there would be little we could do to stop them.\n\nHowever, if we had an ally that was willing and able to protect us, the people of England would sleep much more soundly. We will need to turn to the United States and guarantee their military support, for the sake of the safety of England."
ENG_german_military_advisors_desc:0 "In its present state, the English Army is far too undertrained to face the challenges of modern warfare, we will need to seek the help of the Germans if this is to change. Because of the Germans success during the war, their military advisors have been proven to be highly skilled. Employing them within our army will bring us up to date and make reuniting our isle by force a lot more plausible."
ENG_no_military_advisors_desc:0 "Even though our military is known to be undertrained, over reliance on either the Americans or the Germans is something that is critical for us to avoid. It would only diminish England to nothing more than pawn to be used by either superpower. Refusing advisors from both sides will weaken our own military but it will help us to run a self sufficient army, free from foreign interference.\n\nWe can not allow any other country to know how we intend to wage war; our army, like the rest of our country, will remain independent."
ENG_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "In its present state, the English Army is far too undertrained to face the challenges of modern warfare, we will need to seek the help of American military advisors if this is to change. They will equip our forces with the skills necessary to defend our shores against any German threat. This would bring us much closer to the United States, though be that as it may we need help and we will be damned if we turn to the Germans."
ENG_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that Wales is back under our control our military and our government appear a lot stronger than they did before. We can now turn our attention on to more relevant parts of the world. Thatcher is one step closer to reuniting the isle.\n\nEngland is now ready to begin retaking its proper position on the international scene."
ENG_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "The current position of the United Kingdom is still a precarious one, however it could also be highly profitable. Thatcher believes that it is possible for the UK to leverage its power between Germany and the United States, to get them to sign deals favorable to England. Pym will need to be won over before we can start the delicate tasks that will enable us to use our current position to its greatest extent."
ENG_preparing_for_the_enemy_desc:0 "Thatcher is keen for the army to show its strength in a wargame, warding off any prospective invaders. The question remains, who should be the focus of our display, both sides could be threats in the future. Either Way the choice that is made will need to be calculated, neither the Americans nor the Germans have our interests at heart.\n\nWe will have to remind both of them of our independence; along with our willingness to defend it."
ENG_discuss_the_enemy_desc:0 "Now that we have chosen who the main threat to the United Kingdom is, we can start to draw up plans over what strategies they are likely to use if they were to invade us. From there we will figure out how we should counteract their attacks. There can be no chance of the enemy ever taking control of our country. We will never be subjugated again."
ENG_grab_some_blueprints_desc:0 "Though we may be working with them now, there is no guarantee to how long this relationship may continue, yet there is still plenty that we would like to get out of our temporary ally. They have several blueprints that we would like to borrow and since they will not be willing to hand them over for free, we will have to steal them. Fortunately for us, MI6 is quite adept at capturing such material, they will work with Thatcher to secure the designs that will considerably improve our technology."
ENG_study_the_results_desc:0 "The Royal Army has exerted itself tremendously and provided us with some valuable data on how our opponent is likely to handle itself in battle. We will need to assess this data and use it to our advantage, should we ever have to face them in an actual war. Though there is still hope that the UK will never have to wage war again, we have become more ready than ever to defend our United Kingdom."
ENG_a_conference_in_dover_desc:0 "Foreign investment is what is going to enrich the people of England, and with two superpowers striving to trump the other, we will become very rich indeed. And to maximise our profits, Thatcher has already come up with a plan to auction off a contract that would grant extra access to the workers of the UK. She will have to continue to guide Pym to make it certain that the country continues to play the two sides off against each other.\n\nOur international course has been chartered, now is the time for us on our journey toward economic rejuvenation."
ENG_the_promise_of_free_enterprise_desc:0 "If we are to attract more investment into the UK, we will have to assure foreign companies that whichever super power they will be able to invest freely in our markets, without the government interfering. Even though this would help we still want to maintain control of our economy; however Thatcher believes there is a way we can get the best of both worlds. She will allude to free enterprise, but never fully commit to it, using the power of plausible deniability we will raise more and more investment."
ENG_hint_at_the_scottish_oil_desc:0 "As a result of our reunification with Scotland, many sizable oil fields in the North Sea have come under our control. This has certainly caught the attention of foreign firms who are eager to exploit our resources.\n\nThatcher has planned to make a "slipup" in her next speech where she will mention the possibility of investors gaining access to UK oil; raising the stakes and our economy higher and higher."
ENG_redistribute_the_money_desc:0 "In the wake of the civil war, England was in ruin. Thatcher has since helped the country rebuild, expand and reunify the United Kingdom. But despite all this, the English people have remained poor.\n\nThe auction of 'the contract' has left a lot of money in the hands of the government. It is enough to help fund an expansion in state education and welfare; this would make the populace a good deal more satisfied with Thatcher's leadership."
ENG_upsell_a_trade_deal_desc:0 "It is such a great shame that we will only be able to trade with either America or Germany. Which is a sad reality as we could have profited greatly from trading with two superpowers.\n\nRather than making the decision of who we shall open our markets to ourselves, we will make them bid for it. We trust that this trade deal will be highly sought after and that as a result, we will make a great deal of money from selling it."
ENG_the_value_of_the_english_market_desc:0 "England has large reserves of steel and coal, as well as very good potential to have a large amount of industrial output. As bidding has begun for the trade deal, we should remind both sides of these immense benefits; as well as how It would be an awful shame if the other side were to get access to it and they were to lose out. They will raise their bids and we will only profit more."
ENG_raise_the_stakes_desc:0 "Thus far the bids for the trade deal have been decent; but they could be higher.\n\nWe already know that both sides are desperate to prevent fiercely trying to curb the power of the other. By "hinting" at the possibility of access to British ports being a part of the trade deal, both sides will take the auction a lot more seriously. They will not want to allow the other such a strategic base in such a crucial region.\n\nThey will need to win this now."
ENG_our_proficiency_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but the United Kingdom is back on the world stage, and what an entrance we have made. After all, we have just managed to tactfully outmanoeuvre two global superpowers with ease.\n\nPrestige has returned to England and everyone in the country is better for it, from the elites to the workers. Thatcher has succeeded in solidifying our independence and warding of all foreign influences. Our position is once again safe and secure."
ENG_reveal_our_motive_desc:0 "The reunification of the United Kingdom and our outwitting of Germany and the United States has left us in good stead internationally. Thatcher believes that we should go one step further and declare Britain to be the 5th Superpower.\n\nBoth the Germans and Americans will not be best pleased with this announcement, but it is necessary if Britain is to return to its righteous place and stand shoulder to shoulder, eye to eye with the rest of the world."
ENG_a_great_britain_desc:0 "In spite of all obstacles, Thatcher has done it; Great Britain is resurgent.\n\nThough many doubted we would ever recover from our greatest defeat and subsequent German subjugation, we have. Wales and Scotland have been reunified with England and the German presence in Cornwall has been dislodged. We can now stand free of their influence.\n\nA new era has begun for our country, we are now ready to compete with the rest of the world again. Let us hope that our power continues to rise; so that the world can once again realise the power of Great Britain."

ENG_united_england_wins_desc:0 "It would seem the Royal Party have fallen far from their glory days indeed, for despite every foul attempt at deceit thrown our way it is not Margaret Thatcher who won the elections. For two decades a Royal Party member was PM, but those days are over, for it was United England who won the elections!\n\nUnder the leadership of the new Prime Minister Reginald Maudling, a noted liberal and Party Chairman Harold Macmillan United England shall bring the nation the reforms it requires to survive in an ever changing world. The gross corruption and nepotism of the Royal Party will not be tolerated, we will reform England root and stem into a nation our children will be proud to call home."
ENG_but_inside_its_as_divided_as_ever_desc:0 "United England is unfortunately not a single party, but rather it is an amalgamation of two distinct groups who were both dissatisfied with the status quo under the Royal Party. First are the Liberals who nominally lead United England, the furthest left allowed under Royal Party rule the Liberals desire a return to the glory days of English democracy when every man had his vote and he didn't have only one option to vote for.\n\nBy contrast, the current majority of the party aren't loyal to the Liberal ideal so much as they are to the person of Party Chairman Harold Macmillan. Above all else, Macmillan desires the utter obliteration of fascism in England, but whether he can continue to work with the Liberals to do so is still the question."
ENG_meet_the_chairman_desc:0 "Some of the more stupid call Harold Macmillan a coward for being one of the architects of the English surrender. Those men are fools, the Party Chairman acted as he did not because he wished for the current situation to arise but because the alternative was seeing England bombed into oblivion and its youth slaughtered in pointless battles for petty politics.\n\nHarold Macmillan will do anything to see that never comes to pass again, but whilst he has influence over United England he also wouldn't mind some revenge against those who used the capitulation of England to their own advantage to acquire wealth and power. The former Royal Party may have been his allies, but they were never his friends. Perhaps things can be different with Maudling."
ENG_meet_the_PM_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling has long been a firebrand Liberal in English politics. Protected as he was by the influence of the reformist faction of the Royal Party, Maudling was one of the more vocal government critics and his image stuck in the minds of the people for this. Perhaps then it was no surprise that nobody else could lead a party seeking to restore England's glory days. Macmillan might have the majority of the party on his side but he does need Maudling for the moment.\n\nStill, should Maudling secure his position as Prime Minister he would institute the reforms promised and more. For when you look across England, there is nobody else who has the ability whilst also being acceptable to the current establishment."
ENG_parliament_opens_desc:0 "Elections are always times of great reflection for the political classes. Knowing that your constituents saw fit to elect you despite whatever dirt your opponent threw your way is certainly a great morale booster for the newly elected and old guard alike.\n\nThis opening of Parliament however looks to be more interesting than most, as the two most important men in United England talk of their visions for the nation's future. Harold Macmillan the Party Chairman looks set to aggrandise his vision of an England secure from the threat of fascism and corruption, whilst PM Reginald Maudling seems likely to adress the matters of the flaws in the current democratic system and his solutions. Whom the party shall pay more attention to, however, is not certain."
ENG_inside_westminister_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan and Reginald Maudling are critical members of the leadership of the United England party, but their increasingly divergent political views are causing... issues. Macmillan’s position that government guidance remains paramount for defending democracy and Maudling’s Shakespearean insistence that liberty not be sacrificed in the name of stability are increasingly pulling the party into two different camps. Westminster is not large enough for the egos of these two men to coexist; the party will have to choose one or the other."
ENG_to_protect_england_desc:0 "In times of crisis it is not the idealists we look to for comfort. Men are not comforted by pretty words, nor are they comforted by ideals. It is action and experience which keeps the people calm and focused upon their own lives, the knowledge that they will not have to do anything, for the experts will take care of the problem. That is what Harold Macmillan offers England.\n\nWhen the liberal elements of our party buckle, Harold Macmillan will stand fast. Should the skies darken with approaching aircraft the people will be able to retreat to prebuilt shelters rather than their basements. Should the wolves at our door come knocking they will not find weakness in England, for Macmillan will sacrifice anything and everything for the protection of our people. Nothing else is acceptable."
ENG_here_we_go_again_desc:0 "More than thirty years of political experience have made Harold Macmillan into a master of the parliamentary battlegrounds. Working from behind the scenes, the man in the background ensured that the Royal Party didn't grow too abusive in their pursuit of power whilst keeping the Germans minds as far from England as possible.\n\nNow Macmillan is in much the same situation, the vital pillar on which PM Maudling's support rests, ensuring that United England works in a smooth and efficient manner in regards to government whilst keeping the National Front and relict Royal Party disorganised. Helped by the fact that much of United England is loyal to him personally, Macmillan will keep our nation on a steady course."
ENG_look_over_the_floor_desc:0 "The English \"opposition\" is the single biggest collection of liars, frauds and criminals that have ever had the dishonour to sit in parliament. In the Royal Party are the corrupt, the arrogant sellouts who if they had their way would have us still answering to Germany in full. Far from their once lofty heights, the Royal Party is a disgraceful institution that ought be put to rest.\n\nThen we have the National Front. Mere words cannot describe the hatred United England has for those disgusting, wretched, feculent pieces of refuse. Worse than wanting out subordination to the Reich, worse even than the thousands they betrayed to Germany is their true allegiance. Fascism. If we have to fight for a thousand years to ensure the National Front never gain power, it will be a thousand well spent."
ENG_the_corrupt_and_the_fash_have_to_go_desc:0 "United England is now England's only hope for salvation from the forces of fascism and corruption. If either of our opposition parties were ever to gain power it would be a disaster without comparison, so venal and debased are their flaws. Luckily, the Party Chairman has a plan he will outline to Prime Minister Maudling.\n\nThe corruption and disloyalty of our opposition comes with certain advantages, namely that were United England to answer public calls for the investigation of corruption within parliament we would catch a far greater number of MP's with loyalties to the National Front and Royal Party than we would our own supporters. We can even investigate and search for evidence ourselves, for who knows the secrets of our former friends better than Macmillan?"
ENG_the_anti_corruption_act_desc:0 "Corruption is a disease that affects politicians like lice. A little isn't really an issue worth dealing with, a moderate amount might require some care to stamp out. When faced with an infestation, only fumigation will solve our problem.\n\nThe Anti Corruption Act is a bill drafted by Mr Macmillan and other concerned MP's of United England to outline some clear expectations on what the newly reformed England expects of its political classes, with some severe penalties for gross levels of corruption and a dedicated watchdog organisation to to catch the more unwise MP's in the act. Oh, the Royal Party and the National Front will howl and complain no doubt, but it is us, not them who are in power now. The public will love us even more for this."
ENG_the_back_bench_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberal faction of United England have always been the second in charge for a reason, namely that the those loyal to Macmillan outnumber them by a not insignificant amount. Yet, their ideals of a truly restored democracy and extensive social reform aren't inherently terrible, and their support is useful. It's why we don't treat them like we do the fascists, after all.\n\nLed by the current Prime Minister Mr Maudling, they might not be equal partners in our current alliance of United England, but they are partners nonetheless, and we ought to be careful that we don't alienate them unnecessarily. They are members of Parliament after all, and even one or two sunken bills could be a detriment to the vision of the Party Chairman. So we shall let them be."
ENG_talk_with_maudling_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling's heart is in the right place - the restoration of democracy, of English liberties and responsible, responsive government - but he misses the forest for the trees. With the dogs baying across the Channel and... disorderly elements still a threat at home, we have to make sure that England is safe for democracy before all else. We need to convince Maudling to see things our way."
ENG_promise_them_acts_and_them_over_desc:0 "You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. How that old saying relates to our current situation is that we really do need to make some surface level appeals to the more Liberal members of United England to keep them on the same train of thought. We will throw them a few bones to keep them happy, as it were.\n\nThe easiest way to keep them happy would be to introduce some more \"liberal\" acts into our legislative agenda, all the usually hot air about the inherent rights of the people and free expression and whatnot. Perhaps even some pardons for a few political prisoners thrown in with it. We should probably take care to ensure we don't release any fascists, though."
ENG_the_better_education_act_desc:0 "One thing both the Macmillanist and Liberal factions of United England most assuredly agree on is that the state of our education system is simply abysmal. The Royal Party truly was the party of the elite, having neglected the common people so thoroughly that they even defunded countless public schools. Truly, the fact that this is even an issue highlights the pitiful nature of our current situation.\n\nThe Better Education Act is a bill which will attempt to reform the education system into something responsible to the wants and needs of students, rather than fruitlessly clinging to outdated, ineffective methods. With this, we can guarantee the best for our future scholars and learners. We will also be able to shore up our rural support by directing funding to them in particular."
ENG_a_dinner_with_monty_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery is one of the few men still alive who knows exactly why it was that the United Kingdom agreed to its own dismantlement. He was with Macmillan when the treaty was negotiated, and amongst the most fervent voices for maintaining the peace at all costs. His subsequent victory over the insurgent HMMLR has only made him more useful to the future of England, and perhaps its time he be brought more directly on board with that future.\n\nA meeting is required, and a reasonably private one at that. We can reach out to one of his stepsons to arrange it and broach the possible subjects. Namely the prevention of any future Operation Sealion. Montgomery will likely be interested, he's quite the reasonable man after all. We just need to give him the right incentive."
ENG_hunting_with_templar_desc:0 "Gerad Templer has long served England loyally, and his crucial role in preventing the foul organisation HMMLR from winning the Civil War has only increased the regard for him in the political classes. However, Templar never really got along all that well with us civilian officials, in no small part due to our position on the matter of throwing away German restrictions on the military apparatus.\n\nWith United England's new defensive foreign policy focus however, it might be possible to bring Mr Templer on board with our agenda. We can speak of it whilst on a fox hunt, which the man is known to love, especially on the subject of our current military strength and how that might be improved. Even in the worst case scenarios though, what harm could a little chat do?"
ENG_a_calm_day_in_parliament_desc:0 "The situation is actually rather decent at the moment. Yes, the foreign policy matter is a bit tense, and the Royal Party is simmering, yet within the party things are about as harmonious as they've ever been. The Party Chairman and the Prime Minister have even managed to get out the legislative agenda ahead of time, to the surprise of all who know the two men. Mayhaps they've sorted out their differences?\n\nWell, regardless of what is happening, it is quite refreshing to know that political differences aside, United England is beginning to coalesce into a party worth the label. Perhaps this new unity can be showcased in the speech PM Maudling is said to be preparing. It will certainly be an interesting listen."
ENG_the_aftermath_of_the_debate_desc:0 "Apparently you can never hammer the message home hard enough when it comes to the Liberal faction of United England. We protected them from Royal Party persecution, we aided them when they needed it, we even gave them the post of Prime Minister. Well, they evidently believe they deserve more. Oh, they'll get exactly what they deserve.\n\nMacmillan is distinctly unamused to hear some of these tales. More accurately, he has been put in a state of apoplectic rage over some of these tales, but that is hardly unexpected given the magnitude of this betrayal. Evidently, it is not the job of the Liberals to save England from Germany. Evidently, it is not their business to be in politics at all. When you want to do something right, you damn well do it yourself."
ENG_maudling_will_attack_us_for_the_last_time_desc:0 "The Liberals are still a part of United England nominally, but the recent events have left some easily distinguishable marks between those loyal to our Party Chairman and those loyal to the Prime Minister. Macmillan is still quite incensed at the betrayal of Maudling, but it must be admitted this was hardly unforeseen. A shame, he might have been quite useful if he hadn't acted so rashly.\n\nLet's go on the offensive, then. We've identified a number of troublemakers we can easily expel from the party, or at the very least impress upon them the seriousness of remaining loyal to the PM over the nation. Membership rolls will be purged, key supporters of the Prime Minister censured, and funding for the more Liberal members of United England stopped altogether. That's only the tip of the iceberg. We're just getting started."
ENG_pull_over_the_easily_persuaded_desc:0 "Not all of the Liberal members of United England were involved in the stupidity of Maudling, as much as we might not like to admit it. After all, they're just as opposed to fascism as we are, and the Party Chairman can respect that quite a bit in the current era. We can impress upon the wiser members that we really don't have any problems with their economic or social views, just their mistaken political allegiance.\n\nWe can probably pull over a dozen or so by doing this, and if we offer the right incentives to a few more, United England might start resembling the name it took. Even if we don't succeed in grabbing that many, one or two would be enough to make the point to PM Maudling. He isn't as secure as he might think."
ENG_the_liberals_will_know_their_place_desc:0 "Let it not be said that Macmillan is lacking in mercy. We will not destroy the Liberals in United England, but much rather we will merely cow them. They are too useful, after all. What will end, however, is their nominal independence. The Liberals had their chance to work mostly on their own, and they blew it. when they act, speak and campaign now it will be with men and women loyal to Macmillan looking over their shoulders.\n\nOf course, we cannot guarantee everyone will get the message. The Prime Minister will likely engage in some symbolic resistance, but it won't matter. Macmillan runs this country now, and what he decides will be is what will be."
ENG_dirty_dirty_chesterton_desc:0 "Oh, Chesterton, you bastard! The National Front is the single most despicable collection of traitors assembled this side of HMMLR, and at least HMMLR only intended on making us vassals to the Americans! The National Front and their collection of fascist braindead imbeciles would have happily sold us out to the Germans if they won the election. Unfortunately, they still have a base of public support to draw off of. For England's sake, this bastion of evil will need to be stomped out, and fast!\n\nWe can have some private investigators and the intelligence services dig for the more shocking crimes of the National Front, for the time being. As long as we get the dirt we need, it won't matter how long it takes for us to get it. When we have it, we can finally give that scum Chesterton the sendoff to Hell he deserves."
ENG_ban_the_black_shirts_desc:0 "Someone somewhere once said that revenge was a dish best served cold, and now that we are finally experiencing the feeling we can say without a doubt that that person was most assuredly right. The National Front, a successor to elements of the far right conservatives and the British Union of Fascists, was always far too keen about collaborating with the Germans. There was always mountains of evidence, but the Royal Party never seemed to feel it was the right time to act.\n\nThat's changed now. United England is not the Royal Party. We are men of action, not caricatures of corruption and nepotism. Hence, fascism is now the ideological equivalent of persona non grata in England. We'll ban their organisations, their parties, imprison the fools dumb enough to claim the label openly, and all the while they'll not be capable of lifting a finger against us."
ENG_ban_the_scourge_of_fascism_desc:0 "Well, for all that lofty proclamations of the illegality of fascism get the public's attention, sometimes it's better to avoid the potential conflicts down the road and address matters in the correct way, even if it's after the fact. The \"Banning of Fascism From Politics Act\" does, more or less, exactly what the title of the act states.\n\nOh, it's all hidden behind fancy words in the text of the act, but it doesn't take a genius to divine our feelings about fascism. The fascists are a band of traitors, criminals, and downright scum. United England hates them, England itself hates them, and hell, even the corrupt bastards in the Royal Party hate them! We are going to excise this cancer from England by any means necessary, and to do that we'll need to ban them outright. Who cares about what the Germans - a batch of good-for-nothing fascists - think?"
ENG_the_clean_royal_party_desc:0 "The Royal Party. Once, they were a more noble band of corrupt kleptocratic oligarchs, but now those days are long behind us. It's a shame, really. They served the purpose of keeping England out of the German grasp admirably for the years prior to the German Civil War, but they just weren't willing to go that extra step. Still, you make do with what you have, and we really don't have a use for them at the present time.\n\nNepotism beyond belief, corruption, multiple unconfirmed-but-probably politically motivated killings, the list simply goes on and on. How long should England have to live with these disgraceful politicians? Why should they have to live with them existing in a state of luxury whilst the common man works hard for his bread? The answer is, they shouldn't."
ENG_taking_out_our_trash_desc:0 "Obvious corruption comes with a single rather large advantage over traditional secretive corruption, which is that it's completely obvious to even the most cursory financial examination. How unfortunate for the Royal Party MP's, then, that they've grown used to open corruption over the course of some twenty years of unfettered power.\n\nWe shall launch a series of corruption investigations against the more prominent members of the Royal Party to start off with, but as things roll on we can go over every single Royal MP's records to seek the more hidden grifting as well. Party Chairman Macmillan will be very happy to see this go ahead smoothly."
ENG_dig_out_the_rotten_core_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we can't just imprison all of the corrupt Royal Party MP's. Aside from the negative press, most of them are legitimately guilty of little more than corruption, with only a handful actively collaborating with the Reich and fewer still to any provable extent at that. What we can do, however, is remove those corrupt MP's from parliament in a more conventional manner.\n\nOnce removed from office, new elections for their seats can be held. We might win some of them, but it's no great loss if we don't; we still have a majority. Macmillan's visionary leadership is starting to pan out, which makes one wonder what to do with Maudling."
ENG_the_deal_with_maudling_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling was useful for a time. Had he maintained faith with Party Chairman Macmillan, he might have been permitted to retain the seat of Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he was too greedy and, well, we don't need him anymore. We can't kick him out of the party, nor his Liberals, but we can reduce them to the subordinate role they always should have occupied.\n\nSay goodbye to PM Maudling, and hello to the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan! Oh, and Reggie is now the Vice Prime Minister, for the sake of his ego. Macmillan isn't cruel - he's just doing what he needs to do. That should always be remembered, so that we don't turn into the monsters that the Royal Party became."
ENG_the_PM_power_act_desc:0 "With Harold Macmillan now officially in charge, it is time to remove some of the restrictions we used to keep Maudling in line. For a start, the cabinet will be taking something of a backseat from now on, with the Prime Minister's office acquiring a great deal of executive power, so as to allow Macmillan to fully exercise his vision of a free and fair England.\n\nThere are those who condemn this as some sort of power grab, but they merely lack the understanding of just how important Macmillan is to the continued functioning of England. It was he who guided us up until this point. For his deeds, he has more than earned the right to exercise a significant say in political matters. Out of respect for his vision, we will not stop him. Macmillan will save English democracy, and the people will cheer him on."
ENG_the_protection_of_something_beautiful_desc:0 "We sit at the crossroads of history, for from this precipice we gaze upon there will be no return or second chance for the mighty nation of England. It took us years to even get to this point, years of struggle and bargaining and sacrifice, all for the ideal of a nation where choice was not dictated by some master in Washington or Germania but from London.\n\nIt is Harold Macmillan who got us here, he recognised when it was necessary to stand down and preserve what could be saved, he kept the Germans out of England through guile and dealmaking, he preserved our institutions from within the Royal Party. Now, as Prime Minister he shall ensure that both Democracy and England are protected with the zeal of a man in his prime. Until the last, we do this for England."
ENG_edward_abdicates_desc:0 "The recent elections were surprising in many ways, not least that they occurred at all. But both our politicians and our populace believed that would be the end of surprises as far as they year went. It would seem that asking for calm is pointless however as our government has just received a rather alarming phone call.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII of the House of Windsor, King of England, has abdicated effective immediately. It is easy enough to understand why he did this, aside from being a man of weak political skills and hated by a rather significant percentage of the population, His Majesty could conceivably be held to be at fault for the events of the recent Civil War to some degree. When that is your legacy is it any wonder a man loses the desire to rule?"
ENG_king_henry_takes_the_throne_desc:0 "Edward's abdication does leave us in a bit of a pickle in regards to whom the next monarch shall actually be, the former King having no heir of his own blood. Obviously the American puppet Elizabeth cannot be allowed to accede to the throne, but there is yet one Windsor from the children of George V left untainted by incompetence.\n\nHenry the Duke of Gloucester has remained out of the political spotlight for the past decades, neither supporting our government or that of his niece and instead focusing on charitable affairs. He is our only realistic legitimate option for a successor to Edward VIII, and though he might dislike the idea of becoming monarch, we can remind him of all the strife England might avoid if he did his duty. Aside from the former King, that family are a dependable lot after all."
ENG_a_crown_falls_silent_desc:0 "It seems that England really cannot catch a break on the matter of its Kings. Whilst travelling back from a charitable event his majesty King Henry IX suffered a massive and debilitating stroke that has rendered him bedridden. Despite our hopes doctors have informed us that it is unlikely the King shall ever walk again, much less rule the nation.\n\nThis is a disastrous situation, but as a nation we are capable of recovering from it. Our first action now should be to establish whom shall act as His Majesty's official regent, and from there we will need to go over succession plans. It is quite likely we will be in need of them sooner rather than later if our current run of luck holds."
ENG_the_prince_regent_desc:0 "William the Prince of Wales is a rather sensible lad. Young but not overly so, and more importantly for us he's well on board with our government on the subject of how the nation should be run, to a greater degree than his incapacitated father even. This is good, as given the health of King Henry it is quite likely that William will be taking up the full responsibilities of his fathers position quite soon.\n\nFor now however, William of the House of Windsor will simply act as Prince-Regent to the king. Taking over the official duties which require his majesty to be capable of travelling across the nation. This might prove a good time to get William introduced to the responsibilities of leadership, so to some extent we ought to be thankful."
ENG_the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "King Henry IX, a noble man who took up his duty when nobody else would, a man of strength and determination, a good man, has breathed his last. With his death dies the last child of his majesty George V, and furthermore means the accession of the seventh monarchy of England in the twentieth century.\n\nAll hail King William V, who has taken up the duty and burden of the crown. In these troubling times it is a strong hand that is required to marshal the nations strength, and King William will assist our government in keeping this will at the forefront of our policies. If fortune favours us the King will reign for many decades yet, the first monarch of a reborn Britain perhaps? But as the times change and the world turns one thing remains constant in England. For we shall always say, \"God save the King!\""
ENG_to_protect_democracy_desc:0 "We are United England, our name is not some barely concealed snub at the lower classes or call to action. Our name is a symbol of our ideal, of an England where every man and woman can have their say in how this nation is run, regardless of birth or position. Fishermen and factory owners alike, bosses and workers, landowners and tenants, all have taken a chance and supported us in this last chance at a true democracy unburdened by intimidation and fraud. Now it is up to us to fulfill our promise.\n\nWe in United England do swear this, to protect the principles of democracy which made our nation great in times past. To uphold and live these principles no matter the cost, and to fight to the death to ensure they are never cast down again."
ENG_remember_what_was_before_desc:0 "For the longest time those supporters of the British golden ages democratic principles were forced to linger in the shadows whilst the Royal Party reigned supreme over our nation. Democracy under that party was a decayed and fragile thing, the only party ever able to run without opposition was the RP, with anyone not an independent suffering intimidation or suspiciously great wins for the Royal Party come election time.\n\nBut it was not always so, there was a time where every man had his say and parties of all sorts could attempt to appeal to the individual voter. Creating an atmosphere where politicians needed to serve their people lest they be turned out come election time. Perhaps we can return to this state of affairs given time."
ENG_the_light_of_democracy_never_died_desc:0 "United England is full not of kleptocrats like the Royal Party, or maniacs like the National Front, but is instead filled with those willing to risk everything for their ideals. This is a party for those who believe they can make a difference to the conundrum England finds herself in, and no matter how small a chance it is that we will succeed we must try.\n\nBut even if we don't succeed we can know one thing for sure, democracy is one of the great inventions of mankind, an idea which has the power to raze kingdoms and uproot nations. No matter how much the Royal Party might want to, they couldn't and cannot now kill the idea of democracy. For ideas are as the mountains, unmoving to the whims of mere mortal men."
ENG_meet_with_the_liberals_desc:0 "The agreement between the Party Chairman and the Prime Minister is a simple one. As the Party Chairman does not completely trust the people loyal to him to be loyal to the dream of restoring English democracy, he will allow the Liberal faction of United England under Maudling to have a great deal of influence in how the government dictates policy.\n\nYet, it behooves us to note that we shouldn't merely accept what is handed out to us. Why should we live with crumbs, when a whole cake is there for the taking? Building up some of our own proper support networks now that we no longer need fear the intervention of the Royal Party might be a good start, and then we can proceed to meet and plan out our true goals."
ENG_our_partners_next_door_desc:0 "The Liberal faction of United England is not the dominant one it pains the Prime Minister to admit. Party Chairman Macmillan is the driving force behind United England and that is unlikely to change at the present time, thus we must seek to not oust the Macmillanists but convert them to the cause of democracy. Or at least the cause of Maudling.\n\nTruthfully there is some potential in this proposal, after all even the most conservative of Macmillan's followers despises fascism with a passion and tolerate unhindered democracy in theory. All we need do is convince them that Macmillan won't be around forever, and that it might be profitable to get their names in with the new leadership sooner rather than later."
ENG_meet_with_the_military_desc:0 "The military apparatus of England has always been tied strongly with the Royal Party, dating back from when Montgomery signed the treaty of surrender and convinced the other generals to lay down their arms rather than doom the English people to the bloodshed of fighting in the streets and hills.\n\nNow it is time for Prime Minister Maudling to meet with Montgomery to see what our worries are in the modern age. The Germans still lurk just beyond the English Channel after all and no matter our courage we will need a plan to keep them satisfied or mayhaps deterred. The Prime Minister will also need to inquire as to the actual state of our forces, bloodied as they are by the recent civil war. If we can find some covert supporters more loyal to us than Montgomery, that would just be a bonus."
ENG_introduce_the_concept_of_democratization_desc:0 "English democracy is a joke, and the entire country knows it. The only fair election in the last two decades was held between three splinters of the previously dominant party. Anyone further to the left than liberalism is subject to open intimidation, our election fraud is an international as well as national scandal, and to top it all off we have open fascists who disdain democracy in Parliament.\n\nTo save the soul of England we will need to convince the people that United England as a party is different from the Royal Party. That we truly believe in the system that made our nation the most powerful on earth once upon a time. We will then turn this belief into action by repairing our political infrastructure, but this process of democratization is long and hard. We will need to put in every effort."
ENG_the_great_shift_desc:0 "A change is floating in the winds of politics, a change the like of which England has nary seen since the fall of Britain itself. United England has within itself two factions vying for control and until this moment the victories and power have mostly gone to the Macmillanists. Yet now something is different, and as ordinary Englishmen walk the streets unawares the Liberal faction of United England has begun to assert its dominance.\n\nReginald Maudling is starting to be a Prime Minister in truth and not in name only, and with this \"Great Shift\" seemingly unlikely to cease in the immediate future it would seem that United England looks set to be united in truth, one way or another."
ENG_the_old_man_clears_the_way_desc:0 "Despite our disagreements with Party Chairman Macmillan on the methods by which England shall be returned to democracy, we cannot deny that he has helped us a great deal in ensuring that United England will follow liberal ideals and not personal loyalty to any one man, despite some of his own supporters misgivings no less. As he said in a speech to the party higher ups recently, \"History is apt to judge hardly those who sacrifice tomorrow for today.\"\n\nMacmillan has confided in the Prime Minister privately that what he truly wants is for an Englishman to be capable of walking from Suffolk to Nottinghamshire without fear of violence or thievery. Perhaps we can help him achieve that much whilst he's still around."
ENG_liberating_the_nation_desc:0 "England has long struggled under the oppression of the German occupiers and her own politicians who enabled the worst of their excesses, yet harkening back to their origins in the Reformist faction of the Royal Party, United England seems set to end those days for good. We didn't make the mistakes of HMMLR and achieve this liberation through violence, instead it was through democracy, liberal ideals and deal making that our land has been freed of the Germanic yoke.\n\nIt is perhaps time that we draw the public's attention to this fact, to show that we mean what we say in our election campaigns and that not all of England's problems will be solved by bloodshed and corruption. We do not just liberate our nation from foreign rule, but from its own darkest fears."
ENG_sons_of_britannia_debate_desc:0 "Free speech was one of the items taken away by the German invasion that the people have most sorely missed, in theory the government under the Royal Party allowed it but in practice free speech has been barely tolerated until now. The secret police often intervening to chastise anyone with too scathing criticism of the government.\n\nThis is hopefully something we can change easily enough, but we will need to gain the trust of the people that this isn't an attempt by us to lure out critics. Perhaps we could hold several public debates with our more prominent critics, even encourage impromptu debate halls and questionnaires for those with grievances against the government. Yes it might occasionally get awkward, but what is the point of democracy if you give up because of the parts you don't like?"
ENG_push_macmillan_to_the_side_desc:0 "The \"Great Shift\" is starting to become apparent even to the general public, and with more and more of the party aligned to the Liberal ideal rather than the person of Macmillan. The old man has been a useful and valuable accessory to our movement throughout our period in office, but it falls to the Prime Minister to start preparing for an England without him.\n\nWe can start by easing some of Macmillan's responsibilities as Party Chairman, insert a few more Liberal aligned members of United England to take the weight off of his job. Some cabinet responsibilities we can delegate as well, but we should take care to ensure that even if nothing else that he is not disrespected. Macmillan protected us for years, it would be unjust to push him away without recompense."
ENG_daughters_of_anglia_learn_desc:0 "Education, education, education. The Royal Party were a bunch of laggards on that particular subject, feeling free to let our academic system rot from the inside as teachers were under trained or forced to steer away from politically sensitive topics. Well we're here now and unfortunately it's our duty to fix things.\n\nWe should be careful in our reforms to instill a love of democracy in our youth without encouraging them to associate democracy solely with our own party, which would lead to many problems in the future. So too should we take steps to ensure girls and boys both benefit from these educational opportunities, and that the poor have access as much as the middle class who are the most consistent in sending their children to school."
ENG_britons_vote_desc:0 "Democracy is a fragile system, it requires willing and activate participation from a majority of the population to be truly effective, and the last few decades have strained the public confidence in our electoral system to the breaking point. The people remember the rigged elections of the Royal Party, and the suppression of those who stood against them, which means that if we want our reforged democracy to survive long term we need to make the public believe its real once again.\n\nA series of campaigns over radio and television, and even regular old newspaper adverts to encourage voting in not just national but local council elections would be a good start, and from there we can move on to the business of actually registering the millions of potential voters left neglected in prior governments."
ENG_weaken_the_macmillanists_desc:0 "Despite the recent decision on part of the Party Chairman to operate in the background now that the Liberal faction of United England are starting to wield more active influence in party matters, there are still some Macmillanists who refuse to accept our authority. The reasons vary, for some it is personal dislike of the Prime Minister or Liberalism in general, a fair few are just unwilling to see Macmillan make preparations to leave, but in the end its all the same problem to our Prime Minister. Maudling cannot let this go unanswered.\n\nWe can replace the most vocal with our own supporters, preferably former Macmillanists who now see things our way, this action serving the twofold purpose of sending a message to the recaltrients and rewarding those who turned their coats. Hopefully it will be enough."
ENG_liberal_propaganda_desc:0 "Propaganda is a rather strong word, but when you have opponents like ours is it really that bad? Let us be honest, the National Front is a collection of far rightists who would gladly send us back to the dark days of the German occupation for control of the country. On top of being filthy scum sucking fascists. The Royal Party on the other hand makes a mockery of the term, being so corrupt as to make even the worst elements of United England seem tame in comparison. Truthfully it isn't even a lie to say both would be utter disasters for English democracy.\n\nHence, why we will be paying for advertisements against our opposition, hopefully quashing any attempt to defeat us at the polls before it can arise."
ENG_the_equal_vote_act_desc:0 "It might surprise some, but until this moment there was no specific protection by Parliament or legal precedent that stated unequivocally that every man and woman had a single vote, and indeed there were some conditions which prevented persons from exercising their vote depending upon their race.\n\nThis ends today, as with the Equal Vote Act this government puts to rest the archaic practices of discrimination that have so defined prior ministries in England. Be they man or woman, of caucasion or african heritage, and over the age of 18, any English citizen now has the same vote as any other that they can exercises at will and as they see fit during national and council elections."
ENG_what_is_in_the_systems_of_the_past_desc:0 "What exactly is it that led to the downfall of the United Kingdom? What led its successor into a bloody Civil War? What failures have caused civil unrest and tens of thousands of dead Britons? These are the questions the Prime Minister has long debated, Maudling is, after all, quite the philosophical fellow and tries to model his leadership on the successes of the path rather than the failures. Unfortunately there is something of a paucity of the former but a man can make do.\n\nThe answer to these particular questions however is one that came to him almost by chance. Control is the problem, not the existence of a man controlling everything that occurs in a nation, or even temporary absolute control, but the power that comes with control is a tempting one that corrupts those who wield it. We must take care that we do not outstay our welcome."
ENG_what_is_in_our_views_for_the_future_desc:0 "England stands at a great precipice, one wrong step could send us over the edge and into the pit of dictatorship and corruption, letting the flower of democracy wither away in the darkness. But should we tread the path with care we could well see all our efforts rewarded, and English democracy bloom in the light.\n\nThis is Reginald Maudling's view of our potential futures. We are far enough along to be so close to success, but just far enough away to need to worry about the chasm still. It will not be an easy journey to reach a fully functioning democracy, it will not be a walk in the park. This last stretch will require great efforts from us, for even greater rewards."
ENG_the_clear_parliament_act_desc:0 "Frankly the people don't trust Parliament at the present time, seeing it as an almost otherworldly force that does as it pleases when it pleases and they only get to read about it in the newspapers.\n\nThe Clear Parliament Act is one of the Prime Ministers more original ideas to be quite honest, showing the path to democracy by showing how the demcoratic process works to the general populace. Recordings of parliamentary sessions will be made available to the general public via the BBC and any observer may deign to look upon the government in action during these sessions. It is not a perfect system of course, but as systems go it is certainly better than most."
ENG_the_kids_born_into_a_corrupt_system_desc:0 "It is a rare thing that a Prime Minister can have something truly in common with even the lowliest of paupers, but Reginald Maudling raised a child through the dark years of England. His daughter Caroline is just one of an entire generation who grew up knowing their country at its lowest state, and there are many thousands like her who are disillusioned, despondent and out of work.\n\nThe Prime Minister has personally advocated for a programme to assist the youth of these troubled times, giving them access to more opportunities to better themselves, get jobs and escape the systems which entrap them in lives of drudgery and misery. If even a few make it out, it will have been money well spent."
ENG_the_students_will_learn_the_new_way_desc:0 "The youth have a certain amount of influence on society that often goes overlooked, namely that their beliefs are shaped in large part by the years of their early twenties, and then often set solid for life barring some great upheaval. Well, we can certainly use that.\n\nThe \"New Way\" is the term coined for Prime Minister Maudling's comprehensive series of reforms and changes to the education and political systems. Encouraging public backing of democratic ideals, tolerance for different ways of life and experimentation and a general lessening of the law and order focussed public appeals of prior Ministries. The children of this age will grow up in a land of tolerance and freedom of expression, it is our hope they can pass these ideals on to their own children some day."
ENG_the_liberal_education_act_desc:0 "The Liberal Education Act is somewhat ostentatiously named it must be admitted, but accuracy is important when making major changes that will affect the general public and this bill of reform will most certainly do just that.\n\nThe overarching goal of the Act is a fairly concise one, that inaccuracies, biases and faults in the education system which have been extant up until this point, the actions of the coalition government in the Second World War and their portrayal for example, will be corrected. Additionally more funding will be given to universities and facilities of higher education, so as to increase the number of trained specialists in various professions available to England."
ENG_no_more_government_news_paper_desc:0 "It would be fair to say that despite our efforts to reduce government influence over the mass media, there have been some things which have escaped our notice and amongst these items is the fact that the government owns in part or in totality several of the larger and more well read news corporations and broadcasters.\n\nWhilst not in theory a bad thing, the potential for this to be misused by ourselves let alone the other less scrupulous political parties is quite frankly a bit unsettling. The companies will be privatised with the exception of the EBC, which shall return to its prior mandate of being an apolitical broadcaster. This can be used as an example to the public of our commitment to the liberal ideal of a government which is hands off, hopefully without giving the Royal Party a way back in."
ENG_the_modern_media_desc:0 "Strangely, the Royal Party never really got around to encouraging the widespread adoption of personal televisions and radios in all their years of governance. Perhaps we should be less surprised, after all they often forgot to pretend they weren't a party of the elite.\n\nBut it behooves us to not acknowledge the utility of these devices, a television can grant knowledge of the wider worlds events to anyone willing to listen, a radio much the same and for cheaper prices. We should invest in ensuring that the people of England have opportunities to view all the political points available, and not just that which the government deems to be acceptable. The media apparatus will probably be happy with this as well, after all a higher viewership is never a bad move."
ENG_the_free_press_act_desc:0 "It has been the policy of Prime Minister Reginald Maudling in particular and the United England party as an institution that the prior restrictions on the nature and content which politics is reported in ought to be changed. Indeed, we have greatly lessened the restrictions upon most Broadcasting networks and our influence upon them up until this point, but it does rather fall to us to make this sort of thing official.\n\nThe Free Press Act officially and permanently bans the influence of politicians upon the media, with grave repercussions for those caught doing so. Additionally it prevents the government or those employed by the government from owning political media networks. With luck some of the opposition might even listen to us."
ENG_the_start_of_something_beautiful_desc:0 "It is a slow process, much like gardening. You don't notice its growth by the minute or even by the hour, but slowly and surely democracy is beginning to take root once more in England. Be it the debates you can hear in pubs that would have been out of the question a scant few years before, or the numerous independent or minor parties seeking council and even parliamentary seats. You can see it in the eyes of students and the voices of up and coming aids, people are once more beginning to believe in democracy.\n\nThis is what United England always wanted, and thanks to Reginald Maudling it is what we have to boast about. The beauty of a working democracy is something we will need to nurture, until it can survive without us."

Granted, we all have the common goal of opposing the corruption and ineptitude of the Royal Party, but the relations between our factions are nonetheless somewhat strained. Despite this, we have evidently been successful at our goals, for in spite of what our good \"friends\" in the opposition have alleged us of doing, and despite our own problems as a party, we have just been reelected to government.\n\nThe people have chosen what is right over promises our opponents cannot keep, and so now it falls to us to come through on our own promises. The necessary work of turning England into a nation we can be proud of, and ensuring nobody interrupts that work before it is done."
ENG_fascism_failed_again_desc:0 "Fascism is a blight upon all that is good and just in this world, a cancer upon nations and states across the globe that ought to be burned in the hellfire it spawned from. Yet in England we have prevented its rise, we have prevented the insidious infection from seizing power and influence for its masters in Germania. All thanks to the work of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\n\nMacmillan who recognised the mistake of the Royal Party in allowing the fascist hardliners into their ranks, who has always and will continue to oppose it wherever it rears its ugly head in England. England stands united by its traditions, its spirit and its Prime Minister. Fascism and all who act as its agents are not welcome here."
ENG_lets_make_sure_that_it_will_never_rise_again_desc:0 "When a feral dog attacks a human being, you do not coddle the animal. You do not let it live whilst the potential for danger remains from it. Any sensible person merely compels it to stay still before blasting the diseased creature in the head, and the metaphor being used here ought to be applied to those who would corrupt England's soul with fascism as well.\n\nNot literally, unfortunately, there are certain standards which must be maintained after all. No, we need to choose a target. Our work will require that the so called "loyal opposition" be neutralized on a political level. It's quite unfortunate, but then again, we wouldn't need to do this if they hadn't collectively decided to become filthy rat-bastard scum-of-the-earth German-loving whoreson traitors. If they didn't, we wouldn't be here. The question is, who's a bigger traitor?"
ENG_combat_the_royal_party_desc:0 "The Royal Party. Once, we were a part of that dismal mess of a coalition. The Prime Minister himself felt they were the only option to keep England's spirit alive and kicking, everything else seemed likely to only get England's best hope quashed, like so many other groups. Now, they act as the voice of Germania in England, second only to the disgusting National Front.\n\n20 years they had to change, 20 long and tiring years where we tried to convince them that not all was lost, that we could strive for better things, better ideals than simple survival. We were ignored, and so we come to the crossroads we were always going to reach. The Royal Party and its tendrils throughout English society die today, we shall be the ones to kill it."
ENG_lure_the_germanophiles_desc:0 "The most odious portion of the Royal Party by far is that section known in common parlance as the \"germanophiles\". An odd group, not really organised around a singular leader so much as they are united in their shared disdain for loyalty to their country and a desire for the perks they so enjoyed when England was under their leadership. Well, these opportunists are to be our first targets, and how fortuitous is it that we have a sting operation just ready and waiting in the wings.\n\nWe won't make up any evidence, some letters will be sent to them and they will be invited to a meeting with what they thinking is a German intelligence officer. The rest will be all up to them. The PM thinks he won't be disappointed."
ENG_are_these_the_people_you_voted_for_desc:0 "A tip for whenever members of our party seek to set up political stings in the future, always make sure that there was a minimum of prodding from yourselves, and that the targets were the ones who implicated themselves in whatever they thought was going on. It's a matter of publicity, the man on the street might not care if an MP is arrested for what he might have done, but will pay far more attention to the man arrested for joining a plot he thought was legitimate.\n\nThe meeting will occur, we will record the whole thing and have the constabulary arrest them in full view of the press as they leave the building. The public won't even know we were involved."
ENG_investigate_the_royal_party_desc:0 "We never did get around to launching a truly thorough investigation into the Royal Party. Maybe it was foolish optimism on our part, but the Prime Minister believed the corrupt imbeciles might get the hint when the worst eggs of the bunch were removed. Predictably, the Royal Party has shown itself to be a rats nest of corruption and ineptitude. There isn't even any sign that the party leadership are shocked by some of the accusations the press level against them.\n\nSo, given the situation at hand, we will resolve it with an iron fist. Every single MP and high ranking member of the Royal Party will be investigated, thoroughly. We will find everything, every secret and every crime they've ever been party to. Then, we will solve the matter of the disloyal opposition once and for all."
ENG_reveal_the_findings_desc:0 "Oh, how satisfying victory can be. Our investigations went ahead, and the things they uncovered have shocked even some of the most optimistic of our intelligence services. 187 pages worth of shocking acts, lies, and secrets the Royal Party would, and sometimes did, kill to keep out of the limelight. It's all ours, every single piece of their dirty deeds.\n\n187 pages of shame, 187 pages of criminality, 187 pages of corruption. We can show it to the press ourselves, give them copies, hell, give the people copies to hand out by the dozen. Let the entire nation see what the Royal Party really is, not the facade they have been careful to keep. Let them be judged as they would have judged us. A fitting punishment for traitors!"
ENG_the_corruption_act_desc:0 "Public opinion is an important thing, you know, and why should it not be? Is not our legitimacy gained by the people's commitment to never again letting fascism have a grip over England? Oh, the Royal Party might not strictly be fascist, but being so completely and utterly corrupt that you get caught trying to sell the nation to the Germans is somewhat embarrassing at the very least.\n\nHence the introduction of the Corruption Act by Prime Minister Macmillan and Deputy PM Maudling. An act which crystalises the policy of United England in a series of easy to read paragraphs, perfect for public consumption. Unofficially, this is just the simplest way to indict most of the Royal Party in one fell swoop. We can deal with leftovers later."
ENG_lock_the_traitors_up_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a stain on our heroic history. These cowards decided they would rather kneel on a plastic throne than challenge the German occupiers, then proceeded to use their position as nothing but a fast track to self-enrichment. Each and everyone of them are just as responsible for the Civil War as the terrorists themselves, and they should be treated as such. \n\n Our preparations must be quick. A few hasty trials in a makeshift courtroom, and we will send these empty suits to receive proper justice, mostly involving a brick wall and a group of riflemen. United England will live up to its ideals by removing the parasites who sought to drive our once-righteous nation into weak servility, and create a united front against those who wish to see us bow before Germany. For the dream of a union to live, the Royal Party must die."
ENG_crackdown_on_the_NF_desc:0 "There do not, in the fair English language, exist a series of words properly profane enough to describe our Prime Minister's thoughts on the political organisation known as the National Front. We could call them traitors, except that many actual traitors had a great deal more scruples. We could call them spies and German sympathisers, which would be entirely accurate, yet still not quite give the full scope of their debauchery.\n\nNo, perhaps an accurate description is not needed at the time being, it doesn't affect our plan after all. Under the direct orders of the Prime Minister, the National Front is to be considered a subversive foreign organisation, and dealt with as such. We will end the madness of English fascism permanently."
ENG_the_last_rats_in_england_desc:0 "The National Front isn't quite as great a force as it once was. We wouldn't like to take all the credit, some of which must obviously go to the insanity of the organisation in question, but we must admit that it was a pleasure to dismantle it piece by piece.\n\nNow it's just Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, his little gang of sycophants, and a handful of others that are left, a paltry band from the force that briefly sought to rival both United England and the Royal Party, but enough to be worth destroying all the same. It's a bit of a shame we don't have that old bastard Moseley around anymore, since he'd make an excellent target for our most righteous vengeance, but we make do with what we can get. Chesterton will suffice."
ENG_plant_the_poison_desc:0 "We didn't hold much faith in the general intelligence of the National Front's remaining MP's, but we, the Intelligence services, and almost all persons with functioning brains thought that they'd be smarter than to reply to message which, to paraphrase an officer involved in its writing, stated \"We are planning to invade, would you be willing to head a government? Sincerely, Germany.\"\n\nThe sheer imbecility is simply jaw dropping, and quite satisfying, to be quite honest. Saying the truth that the National Front are filthy traitors is all well and good, having actual treachery to catch them being involved in is quite another thing entirely. The Prime Minister is ecstatic, the opportunity of a lifetime has arrived on his desk and Macmillan fully intends to use it. Let's not keep the police waiting."
ENG_jail_the_rats_desc:0 "Victory is worth all that it took to arrive there, and our victory is worth thrice as much and then some if you listen to the United England MP's. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, caught in a sting with his party about to commit to supporting a German invasion of our fair isle, the headlines just couldn't be better! We have the trial just about set up now, the rats languish in their cells for the time being, though.\n\nPM Macmillan has stated he's open to hearing opinions on what their long term fates ought to be. Nobody thinks execution is quite the right answer at the moment, but the possibility is definitely being floated."
ENG_a_letter_to_ches_desc:0 "Why go to so much effort when you can get the point across politely? Seems all a bit too much work for one traitor and his band of malcontents, no, Prime Minister Macmillan will handle this one personally.\n\nThe letter will be short and to the point, Arthur Kenneth Chesterton's days in politics are over. If he insists on disputing this, he will suffer the consequences of his past actions that have thus far been postponed for one reason or another. Either he's stupid enough to confront us, or smart enough to know we'll never let him get within twenty miles of a reporter."
ENG_send_him_to_germania_desc:0 "The National Front is a German sponsored subversive organisation, and you unfortunately need a better justification than 'German lapdog' to start executing. Vice Prime Minister Maudling came up with quite the inventive solution to our issue, \"Why not let the Germans have them?\" It's simple and stunningly effective, who will openly support the National Front when they see our enemies giving them succour?\n\nPrime Minister Macmillan is in full agreement with the Liberal faction's suggestions for once, and we have already begun making the preparations for the extradition of Chesterton and his friends. Well, \"extradition\" in the sense of dumping them in the German embassy. It will do."
ENG_the_antifascist_act_desc:0 "Fascism is a plague, a disease upon all that is well and good in English society. It moulds and corrupts what it touches into parodies of their original selves, burning a scar right into the fabric of entire institutions. This will be allowed no longer, and with the Anti Fascist Act, United England will be seen to do what every government prior to now should have. We will scourge this monstrosity from our island.\n\nThe key to this, of course, is to not merely make fascism illegal, but also those ideologies adjacent to it, the sort which the fascists would attempt to camouflage their insidious beliefs with. By banning them too, we can still easily reach the deplorables. We can call our little scuffle with the National Front finished once the last of them are rotting in prison as a reward for their cleverness."
ENG_the_liberal_flower_desc:0 "The Liberals, such a quaint little group. Once, they were our only effective allies, but in recent times the Prime Minister has been doubting their worth for a variety of reasons, not least that they seem oddly squeamish about preventing the disloyal opposition from using elections as a cover to bring back the Germans.\n\nOptimism is all well and good, but not when you apply it to honourless thugs like Thatcher and Chesterton. Granted, one of them isn't truly a problem for us anymore, yet we still need to address the root cause here. The Liberals weaken us. They represent a vulnerability in United England's armour. We must patch it, however we can."
ENG_silence_them_desc:0 "Their ability to appeal to the ordinary Englishman has always been the strength of the Liberals, and now that they're beginning to act in opposition to United England's goals, it might be worth addressing what could be called an emerging threat.\n\nNothing harmful of course, no, we'll just have some frank conversations with the media outlets, especially those on radio and television. It wouldn't do for some of the more disaffected to lose sight of their purpose and start blaming us for the failures of the Liberals. This is no kindness, but it is necessary if we are to expunge the weakness that might allow the beast of fascism back into England."
ENG_fire_those_who_resist_desc:0 "One advantage of Maudling tipping his hand all those months ago is that it has shown us that leaving the reigns of party power in the hands of the untrustworthy is a mistake not worth repeating. To save the soul of England, we will need to quash those who might object before they can use their influence against us.\n\nWe can fire the radical liberals from their positions, and those unwilling to work with us can simply be expelled from the party. There exists the possibility that we might be underestimating them, however, so just in case we'll deal with any Liberal associates in the officer core as well. It never hurts to cover all your bases on matters like these."
ENG_maudlings_friends_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling has been a stalwart ally despite his own flaws and ambition. Perhaps that is why the next step will be so difficult, for he has many who respect him. They probably don't know about his two-faced nature.\n\nPrime Minister Macmillan ought to be the one to do it. Maudling and Macmillan know one another decently well, so Macmillan will be able to break the news to him the best. With luck, we can give him a position of little authority outside the party for him to fritter the rest of his days away on."
ENG_must_go_desc:0 "By far, the greatest shame about this whole affair is having to explain what is happening to Maudling himself. The man deserved better, but his weakness will not serve England well if he were to remain in a position of influence and power. No, it is better this way, after all at least he'll still have responsibilities, just not political ones anymore.\n\nHe'll probably enjoy the relaxation after the last few stressful years he's had."
ENG_the_protection_of_democracy_act_desc:0 "The time has come. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan can look over England now and see a land dedicated to the expulsion and fighting of fascism wherever it lies. However, we must take steps to ensure things remain this way, now that we've dealt with the Liberals and half of the opposition.\n\nThe "Protection of Democracy Act" will play a fairly outsized role in this, the act itself is one of the more complex pieces put to Parliament by the Prime Minister, but it holds true in the essentials to the vision of United England. It gives the office of Prime Minister certain discretionary powers when it comes to matters of national security, in addition to the ability to determine what is and isn't a fascist group. All for the good of the people."
ENG_the_royal_party_rots_desc:0 "Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some. The Royal Party has definitely been on the latter end of that phrase, the once mighty titan of English politics reduced to a tottering behemoth that could fall at any moment.\n\nPerhaps it would be a mercy to put the Royal Party down before they descend further. In any case, the best way to fell a giant is to strike at their legs. We will finish this bastion of corrupt traitors and move on. May England remember them for the monsters they became, and not the party they once were."
ENG_those_who_got_away_desc:0 "As surprising as it might be, the monstrous corruption of the Royal Party is not a universal fact. Oh, for sure, the majority is irredeemably corrupt, but there exist a handful of moderates who align with the RP out of genuine belief rather than any allegiance to the corrupt system which perpetuated the Royal Party.\n\nConsidering the number of pressing events we have on our schedule at the moment, it might be worth doing to leave them be. First, of course, we will need some insurance."
ENG_make_them_bend_the_knee_desc:0 "An opposition is a useful thing, "better us than them" as Harold Macmillan says. Thus, despite our contempt for the handful of idiots still following the Royal Party, we shall let them be, so long as we have some assurances of their conduct.\n\nA simple signed agreement will do. It will be a simple promise for the Royal Party, where they promise not to pursue any actions that would destabilize the government, to do their utmost to discourage fascism where they can, and to not get in our way. Most of them will keep to it, but there might be one or two to use as an example."
ENG_make_them_repent_desc:0 "Why have principled men if you can't use them? Prime Minister Macmillan will call a press conference soon where the Royal Party Moderates will denounce the rest of the party they serve to the public. We'll need to ensure the media get the story right, but once it's done we will have struck a blow against the corrupt heart of the party.\n\nConservatism is a paternalistic ideal after all, and we're simply ensuring the wayward children of the Royal Party demonstrate their fealty to the true protectors of England."
ENG_the_opposition_disappears_desc:0 "The Moderates are now puppets, moving along the strings we have set. While it is true that they could have potentially been the foundation of a capable anti-fascist organization, the possibility that they could have become a threat to our government was far too high. Now, they answer to the same man as the rest of England. Harold Macmillan.\n\nMacmillan is a man of his word, and for the Moderate leadership's cooperation, they will not fall victim to acts and measures they would otherwise find inconvenient. It's only fair. Additionally, they will be permitted to keep the seats they currently hold."
ENG_the_iron_lady_with_greed_desc:0 "Mrs Thatcher is a curious woman, it really must be said. Unlike the rest of her corrupt abomination of a party, she has some principles with which she conducts herself, an affair which seems to baffle her coworkers.\n\nWe face something of a conundrum in dealing with the woman known as the Iron Lady. Perhaps we should just sweep her aside with the rest of her party, but Her potential to lead as a puppet opposition leader is great enough to counterbalance the risks. Even more than that, showing the olive branch towards other non-fascist parties will go a long way towards helping our cause."
ENG_ally_the_thatcherists_desc:0 "Sometimes you need to look at the broken things to rediscover their use properly, and the Thatcherite faction of the Royal Party might yet have some purpose for us. We won't give them promises we can't keep, rather we'll offer the old tradition of the bread or the club.\n\nThere won't be any grand speeches from Mrs. Thatcher. No, all she will be doing is signing a simple and polite agreement dictating the actions of her party. Especially in regards to a certain neighbor across the channel. While the Royal Party may have an unfortunate record of leaking to the Germans, they will now only leak what we want them to."
ENG_a_puppet_on_strings_desc:0 "The Iron Lady has bent rather than be broken, and it's a right good thing she did. As far as the public is concerned, Mrs Thatcher is still the head of the opposition, but in actual fact the remnant Royal Party answer to the same man as the rest of England, Harold Macmillan.\n\nWe'll let her keep her reputation and dignity, for as long as Thatcher serves the interests of England no harm shall come to her."
ENG_much_like_the_rest_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher is too dangerous to leave at our back. The woman turned the corrupt shell of a party which had been split three ways into the second most fearsome political force in England. Who knows what she could do, give some actual time and the absence of our interference.\n\nUnited England will do the proper thing. We will end our opposition once and for all without giving them an opportunity to crawl underground. England's corruption will burn away today, and it shall be United England that lights the match."
ENG_swamp_the_thatcherists_desc:0 "Luckily for us, we still have plenty of dirt on Thatcher and her gang from our time inside the Royal Party and subsequent infiltration of the modern one. We'll need some extra evidence, though, so let's set a bit of bait.\n\nNothing obvious, just enough to ensure that we get the right people on the right set of charges. We still need the public to buy the trial's legitimacy after all, and too much evidence might go against the grain."
ENG_thatcherists_pacified_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher, once the only serious rival to Harold Macmillan for dominion of English politics, is now no longer an issue to be concerned with. Let us move on to better and bigger things, now that corruption and fascism both have been excised from English politics and replaced with more virtuous and sensible political ideals.\n\nThe Royal Party was a good opposition for a time, it must be said, but all things come to an end. It's best we close the door on this act of history."
ENG_no_longer_a_threat_desc:0 "Thatcher's talk of unity and strength in the Royal Party was not meant to apply to England as a whole, but rather the sickly chimera she led. Now that we have pushed her out of government and into a cold cell, we can finally begin building a free, united England in peace. Our economy will not be sold out to wealthy elites, our government will not be dictated by the iron will of one woman; our party will preserve all the ideals that make England great."
ENG_the_patriot_act_desc:0 "It is an age of information, and thanks to a rather obscure case going through the courts recently, we will now be able to have all the information on our citizens that we need to protect them.\n\nThe Patriot Act is the cornerstone of England's new domestic policy on matters of national security, namely that the government has the prerogative to take any action needed to protect the nation from fascist subversion and treachery."
ENG_my_allegiance_is_to_macmillan_and_democracy_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan has led us to greatness. Under his guidance England has once more ascended to a position of respect, if not influence, on the international stage. Internal enemies have been swept aside, and the twin evils of corruption and fascism excised from the national consciousness.\n\nYes, the path has been a hard one, and some have fallen along the way, but compared to the alternative, our actions have been a mercy upon the people of England. Let it be heard by all who would listen, God save the King and long live Prime Minister Macmillan!"
ENG_a_chance_for_freedom_desc:0 "Victory is a sweet nectar, and one on which you can be distracted should you sup upon it too greatly, but let us no downplay the scale of our victory here and today. We won, for the 2nd time in recent history in a democratic election it was United England who emerged victorious. Not the Royal Party and their sycophants or the madmen of the National Front.\n\nWe have the people to thank for this, the people who recognised the necessity of our continued governance. As a show of thanks, we shall give them what they asked for. A return to the glories of the past under the aegis of democracy."
ENG_but_freedom_has_its_costs_desc:0 "Democracy is the ideal which has long motivated United England, but unfortunately it seems that even the purest of ideals is vulnerable to threats from the inside. Opposition to our actions has been mounting from the remnant National Front, who seem poised to make a resurgence should nothing be done about them.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporations who appreciated our economic policies are starting to get a bit big for their boots, trying to exert their influence in the political sphere. It is time that we end this charade that we will allow those once ruled us with us to destroy or corrupt what we built. We have work to do."
ENG_targeting_corporatism_desc:0 "Though socialism is undeniably incorrect on many things, we must reluctantly admit that they might have had a point on the whole "corrupt corporations" issue. The industrial giants and their aristocratic backers are seeking to make this newly flowered democracy one puppeted by their hands, and they are showing interest in buying politicians, votes, even electoral commissioners.\n\nIf our ideal is to survive we must stop this here and now, and one way or another that is exactly what we will do."
ENG_the_giant_that_poisons_our_democracy_desc:0 "The influence of money in politics is like a poison, slowly but surely turning even the noblest of men and women into nothing more than the string puppets of laughing businessmen. If the current crop of CEO's and well to do families get it into their heads that they can influence the process with impunity there will be no going back.\n\nOur first step should be addressing where the influence flows from, before we try to address the matter of who is influenced. Should we succeed then we may make the lives of future generations far easier."
ENG_separating_business_and_democracy_desc:0 "Obviously we cannot remove the influence of business from politics completely, and unfortunate though it may be we do need them around to keep money flowing into our coffers. But that doesn't mean we can't have some regulations on the subject of money and politics.\n\nThese guidelines will be minimalistic, but hopefully they can prevent any overt conflicts of interest, namely by forcing recusal in the case where profit could be garnered by an MP on a vote and strict limits on campaign donations otherwise. It won't prevent everything, but it will stop the worst abuses."
ENG_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military industrial complex of England might not be quite the giant it was back in the days of the Empire, but nonetheless it is still a force to be reckoned with. Hawkish politicians still infest parliament, and it isn't uncommon for businesses with military leanings to lobby for certain actions or interests in Parliament.\n\nIf we were to remove this influence, it is quite possible our military might actually start becoming responsive to what England needs rather than what her suppliers need us to buy."
ENG_both_at_the_opposition_and_back_at_home_desc:0 "United England has been at the forefront of political reform for many of these past years, but just because we want reform doesn't mean some vipers don't exist within our ranks as well as the opposition. We will contact the relevant authorities to begin investigations into the rank and file of United England, mostly to sweep up the obvious abuses and corruptions but also to remind our membership that being apart of the governing party does not grant immunity from consequences.\n\nBesides, it'll look good in the public's eye and that never hurts a bit."
ENG_the_fair_politics_act_desc:0 "The Fair Politics Act aims to reduce the amount of influence that money has on the political landscape, not by removing it entirely but instead by evening the playing field. To begin with, no donations of over 2000 pounds can be accepted to a political campaign unless for charitable purposes, all campaigns will receive some amount of treasury subsidising for basic expenses, and no politician can be in direct control or contact with a business during their term of office.\n\nWith luck we can gradually expand this act into an overarching series of rules for political conduct, preventing abuses by all involved and establishing ironclad penalties for breaches of the act."
ENG_targeting_fascism_desc:0 "We might not agree with Harold Macmillan on everything, but it behooves us to listen to him when he actually has a point. What brought down the England we are trying to restore? Fascism. What corrupt and evil system had free reign over our nation for almost two decades, causing many of our current problems? Fascism. And who, right now sits with us, unwelcome, in the House of Parliament? Fascists.\n\nMacmillan was right, fascism is a disease to be combatted, but we must be surgical as we remove it, so as not to destroy democracy whilst we eradicate the disease. From here we must act carefully."
ENG_the_dirty_fellows_in_the_nf_desc:0 "The National Front is a political party descended from the Hardliner faction of the Royal Party before the split that saw United England emerge along with it. But something is wrong with those words, namely the implication that we need tolerate a party of open fascists existing in this new English democracy at all.\n\nIt is the pleasure of Prime Minister Maudling to announce that the fascists will no longer have free reign to act as a German catspaw. They will answer for what they have done and intended to do, and the people will love us for it."
ENG_outlaw_the_blackshirts_2_desc:0 "Banning fascism is a surprisingly simple process - a bill, a vote and a law which ends with a once dominant party of the English political landscape being rent asunder. The benefits of this action are many, but a surprising one is the change in the manner which the army views us.\n\nTraditionally the military establishment has always hated the ideology which ended the original United Kingdom decades ago. Now that we've banned fascism, some of the higher ranking officers are beginning to look at us, and not the Royal Party, as the political group with England's best interests in mind"
ENG_offer_the_fash_redemption_desc:0 "The National Front has many supporters, and given the efficacy of their propaganda during the years of Royal Party rule perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by this. Yet it is the young who worry us most, those who might potentially carry on the traditions of fascism in secret. We cannot answer this with force, lest we be proven to act like the tyrants the National Front claims us to be. No, we will offer the young and misguided opportunities to deradicalise. We won't be successful with everyone, but we will be successful enough to not worry about future problems."
ENG_the_people_know_better_desc:0 "Fittingly, the final say on fascism comes down to the people who voted them in. Some perhaps thought they were the only option, others maybe were intimidated into voting for the National Front, but there are always genuine supporters indoctrinated by ideology, and those are the real problem.\n\nWe need to address this at the base, convince them to abandon their hateful ideology in favour of a democracy that will do right by them, not the landlords and businessmen."
ENG_the_democratic_education_act_desc:0 "Despite our failures in fully dealing with the fascist problem, there yet remains a long term solution. People learn things best at a young age, and that is where we shall spread our message of democracy the most.\n\nThe Democratic Education Act will ensure that schools across the country address the realities of England's past and interactions with fascist nations and fascism itself. The crimes and corruption will be laid bare, their treachery revealed, their atrocities examined in exquisite detail. Let our children know the virtues of democracy, by seeing for themselves the alternative."
ENG_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc:0 "A rose will not bloom in a garden overgrown with weeds. The lingering tendrils of the old Collaborators’ fascism and corporatism, hostile to the very idea of a diverse democratic polity, have been uprooted from England, leaving fertile soil for the democracy that we strive to become."
ENG_shake_it_up_a_little_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the Liberal faction of United England leads the party, the conservative Macmillanists still remain in overall power, and indeed recently they have begun to brook some of our reforms internally. This is intolerable, but there may yet be a solution that doesn't involve party infighting with a handful of old windbags.\n\nNamely, get rid of the windbags and put our people in their places. It won't please everyone but we don't need the figleaf of conservatism to protect us anymore, United England stands because of those who want change, not those who wish to prevent it."
ENG_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "First things first, we should address the matter of many United England MP's being, well, crotchety old men who were aging when the 2nd World War was going on let alone the Civil War. Old men having too much power for too long is half of what caused things to get this bad in the first place.\n\nNaturally, we cannot just remove MP's altogether but we can lessen their authority and the scope of their duties in cabinet, replacing the party whips would be a good start. The Macmillanists will rant and rave but in the end it is our party now, not theirs."
ENG_back_stab_the_conservatives_desc:0 "When you're about to do something terrible to a friend for their own good it's best to do it quickly and with minimum fuss. But for that we need lists, names and replacements all in order so the entire operation can be over in just 24 hours at the maximum.\n\nTo get those lists will be the job of our junior MP's, the ones below suspicion who will also be the ones filling in most of the positions about to suddenly become vacant. We want this to go off without a hitch, and that means planning."
ENG_hit_and_run_desc:0 "What we are about to do is not a kind act, it is not the act of friends who worked beside each other for years. History will not look upon this kindly, it will look upon it as necessary. In one meeting we will remove all the prominent Macmillanists from their posts, and appoint new, loyal Liberal members of the party in their stead.\n\nPerhaps one day they may forgive us, perhaps one day we may forgive ourselves."
ENG_approach_the_left_desc:0 "The Left Resistance represented the worst of the English leftist political spectrum, madmen and radicals who wanted a revolution of blood for a foolish cause. It is fitting they were mostly defeated along with that madman Stirling and the traitor Auchinleck.\n\nYet, political restrictions on the left don't merely extend to communists but to the old Labour remnants as well, who are unlikely to have done anything too treasonous. Perhaps if we offered them clemency, we might find allies more approachable to our reforms."
ENG_an_act_for_support_desc:0 "A simple piece of legislation it is, but the document sitting before Prime Minister Maudling is the single greatest leap forward for English politics in twenty years. It unbans the Labour party of old, should they be willing to renounce communism and revolutionary socialism that is.\n\nOnce returned, these leftist parties will cease causing civil difficulty for the government and offer their support to the stabilisation and maintenance of England's future. One good deed does not outway years of sins, but it is a start."
ENG_the_party_splits_desc:0 "Nobody can endure everything, and the last straw on the proverbial camel's back has broken for the Macmillanist conservative wing of United England. Our party once united is now unto two separate and distinct groups, but this time it is the Liberals who are the greater power of the two.\n\nWe have enough support that this will not overly affect our governance, perhaps we can even point to it as a demonstration of our commitment to the democracy we are busily restoring. It is a necessity, though a regrettable one."
ENG_the_new_magna_carta_desc:0 "If there's one thing Reginald Maudling can do well that none deny it's market something to the people. "The New Magna Carta" is no exception to this. Created in the bowels of our party headquarters, the document is actually a rather simple one for that it is talked up. What is nigh revolutionary about the document in the modern political era is that rather than increase the amount of governmental power certain offices possess, the New Magna Carta gives more power to the democratically elected offices. Both to Parliament, to the Judiciary and importantly to local councils."
ENG_helping_the_weak_desc:0 "The Royal Party is truly an insidious organisation, they don't merely rely on the old methods of currying favour with the voters but instead actively seek out downtrodden demographics and try to pin the blame for their situations on us. Ignoring the fact that they were in power for 20 years and caused most of the current problems.\n\nBut we must not lash out against the misguided, no, we must educate them instead. Heal them. Save them from what ailments they possess. Then they will know the truth of whom shall help whom."
ENG_the_RPs_abandonment_desc:0 "20 years of government. 20 years of promises. 20 years of failure. What can be said of the Royal Party really, besides the fact that they sold the nation to the wolves of Germany and grew fat off of the scraps of England's carcass.\n\nWhere was the Royal Party when the Germans searched through your homes? Where was the Royal Party when your children starved? Where were the Royal Party when they were shot! Standing at the beck and call of Germany, that's where."
ENG_the_missing_RP_desc:0 "The Royal Party now is a mockery of the very name. A party which hasn't been able to win either fair election it participated in, and has been reduced to a mockery in the newspapers. They lurk in the shadows, denying responsibility for their own mistakes and accusing us of crimes that were theirs. Never do they think of the people they could help, they think merely of power and of what they might do with it when it is seized. They disgust all decent minded people."
ENG_whats_in_the_RP_desc:0 "What of the membership of the Royal Party you ask? Why only the most ruthless band of criminals, crackpots and corrupt MP's this side of the English Channel. The moderates have been long weeded out by ruthless men, the few with any commitment to democracy absorbed into United England when it formed and fewer still into our own ranks.\n\nThere is no salvaging the poor souls who remain under the Royal name in the Houses of Parliament, no chance whatsoever."
ENG_the_RPs_secrets_desc:0 "If you want something to stick, find what they actually did and merely let logical conclusions do the rest. People won't believe a little lie, but if we don't directly say what it is we think the Royal Party did over the years it will have all the more poignant an effect.\n\nFor example, we know the Royal Party had the leaders of the 1953 uprising executed, who is to say that they didn't have other leaders perish in unfortunate circumstances? Or the corruption that we all know they partook in, perhaps all those ill paved roads could have used the funding? It is merely a thought."
ENG_the_final_step_in_democratization_desc:0 "Those parties which threatened democracy by their existence are no more, either reduced into nothing by virtue of what they did or banned outright. It is time then for us to create legitimate alternatives that the people might want to elect for the most trying possibility of all in democracy. That we might not get reelected.\n\nFor now, let us allow the resurrection of the old Labour Party. We can trust they appreciate the seriousness of the situation at any rate, and they hate fascism as much as the next man. They will do."
ENG_bring_back_old_labour_desc:0 "There was a time when it was bad to be labeled a liberal, let alone a leftist in England. Yet we promised those in hiding that the days of persecution were over. Now we have delivered on that and we can begin to see the flower of democracy fully unfold.\n\nLabour was many things, a rival and an opponent yes but never our enemy. We can trust them, we can work with them, and perhaps most importantly we know that should we lose to them next election they will not bring down this edifice we have created."
ENG_a_broken_but_perfect_system_desc:0 "We are not a perfect nation. Hard though it is to admit, we have poverty and corruption yes, even callousness of government on occasion. But we are a democracy. The people can sleep knowing they can judge us on merit rather than fear at the ballot box. For we are committed to their rights when all others are not.\n\nIt has taken many years to reach this point, but perhaps now is a better time than never. Long live Britain, and god save the King!"

ENG_IT_Macmillan_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "England once again emerges onto the world stage. As a shadow of its former self. A nation no longer at the center of the world, no longer a dominant mover in world politics, but as a small nation making its first steps out from the shadows. One may expect England to be swamped by a turbulent sea of change and pulled back down into the depths. But England has been in this spot long ago, when the world was split between spheres of influence and a totalitarian dynasty ruled mainland Europe, and the tiny kingdom in the isles was an afterthought. And with some skillful maneuvering, one may find England as adept as it once was at claiming the spotlight.."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_new_england_desc:0 "Forget everything you know about England! A nation merely a puppet of the German Reich? No longer! The spineless traitors who bend over backwards to Hitler to protect their property and pompous titles? They lost the election! The fascists who serve only as Germany's boot on Britannia's neck? They now are further from power than anytime after the war!\n\nUnited England's England is a country that strongly abhors any sort of Nazism. It will go out and reclaim England's greatness, and forge bonds both new and old. No longer do we cower in the shadow of Adolf Hitler, for we now look the nations of the world right in the eyes!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_dealing_with_cornwall_desc:0 "Outside Bristol is a barbed wire scar that cuts through the country and separates England from the South West Peninsula. Beyond it is Cornwall, a humiliation forced upon us by the Germans, partially to keep us in line, but also to keep a segment of England in eternal torment. One can see a painful reminder of what once was, and what might be.\n\nBut we are not the England of 1943. And we are no longer a nation that needs to have a sword of Damocles dangled permanently over its head. We will eliminate the garrison, and then secure our eternal freedom."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_hurt_them_deep_desc:0 "Halder's forces have been a nuisance for a long time. Any dream the reformists had was shot down because of fears of the garrison. Any sensible reform the reformists proposed was blocked by fear of the garrison. And if the garrison had not been there, we would be a democracy right now, with the UE working side by side with Auchinleck. The garrison will be removed. Out of personal vendetta, yes. But also, to force the reeling Reich to look at us with respect or face the prospect of another landing under the white cliffs of Dover."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_ruin_their_supplies_desc:0 "Intelligence reports from the war showed the rebels oftentimes infiltrated the garrison territory to conduct sabotage and assasination missions against the troops there. These reports detailed tactics, operations and infiltration methods to do these missions. And a lot of these reports were never shown to our gallant allies in the garrison.\n\nLet's pick up where the rebels left off. Destroying warehouses, sabotaging fuel tanks, even robbing railroad cars will deprive the Germans of the necessary materials to wage war against us. We may not be able to do anything as spectacular as burn Plymouth off the face of the earth, but a long campaign of attrition will hurt the garrison just the same."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_strike_their_heart_desc:0 "For the longest time, the garrison has contributed immensely to the suffering of the English people. Their forces have kept the island under threat for years. They have run a piece of English territory like an eastern Reichskommisariat, punishing the good people who live there. And they have stifled any hope that the England of old could be made again.\n\nNow, they collect their reward for their services."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_regaining_our_freedom_desc:0 "The entire formation at Cornwall was eliminated, destroyed by the people and military it was supposed to threaten and coerce. One of the most feared forces of the Heer, led by its most famed generals, now completely destroyed. And England no longer is threatened by any immediate threat on the isles.\n\nThe world has been shown now that England must be taken seriously. It's forces can defeat the Germans in open battle once again. And it has severed all of its old chains and bonds with the Pakt. We stand as a country reborn, a nation that is going to assert its freedom against all comers. And that opens some doors that were once believed tightly shut..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_reaching_out_to_old_friends_desc:0 "The OFN has really been content to ignore us since the war ended. Or when they haven't ignored us, they've been providing guns to the communists and SAS. Now, the armed resistance has failed, and we have got the Germans off our back. Perhaps now is time for a reset in our relationship.\n\nWe will make clear we are the best chance England has now for a free future, one where people are no longer hounded by fascism, and have a high degree of liberty. We can be an extremely valuable member of the OFN, and slide into the role we once held when we were aligned together. It's time to make the calls."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_O'_Canada_desc:0 "Relations haven't been good with Canada lately. They refused to view us as anything other than a Nazi puppet state, which, let's be honest, we were. And our bondage prevented us from making any overtures to the Commonwealth. But now, we don't have the Huns on our back, so we can take advantage of this new state of affairs to rebuild our relationship with our oldest dominion. We can agree to an exchange of ambassadors and normalization of relations. Granted, our difference in monarchs may be an issue, but we do not seek to make them a colony again, only to have them see us as an equal on the world stage."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_cultural_exchange_desc:0 "Canada and the United Kingdom have long shared similar cultures to each other, as well as a fascination for the other's way of life. The war and occupation has temporarily stopped this cultural two-way, and we have gone off in a different direction than Canada has. Why not find out what the other is doing at the moment?\n\nWe must reintroduce the English culture to Canada. Their cities will host exhibitions by modern English artists. Their universities and libraries will be visited by English writers. And English musicians will tour their provinces. And we will gladly allow them to do the same. We will show them England is not in the cultural blight of fetishistic aryan depictions like the rest of Northern Europe. And they will show us that Canada's culture was not purchased by American movie and record studios."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_help_me_help_you_desc:0 "Have an excess of wheat? Ship it over here! Loggers out of work? We'll buy it from you! Want some workers to help with your factory? Why not build it here? Need help with your chemical plant? We have a few things I.G. Farben left behind in the war that might help you…\n\nBy helping Canada with a variety of problems, we can help them overcome the various challenges that they may face. And once they realize they need England, they will be sure to extend their thanks through improved diplomatic relations."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_our_greatest_ally_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we have seen many alliances of convenience take shape and dissolve through countless wars. One day, we align with the Spanish against the French, the next, we align with the French against the Spanish. Diplomacy is complicated, and oftentimes confusing. But in our recent history, when we were at our darkest moments, one country could be expected to come in and give their all against the enemies of freedom. And we must contact the United States to restore our grand alliance once more."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_the_propaganda_giant_desc:0 "America is a country with massive problems. Under the surface one will find a massive gap between rich and poor, rampant discrimination and racial violence, and a nation in permanent fear of being unable to defend itself from the Nazis or Japanese. Yet, you ask anyone outside the US what America is, and they will tell you it is a nation of tremendous opportunity, a melting pot of the cultures of the world, and a great protector of freedom. This is because for all the problems it has, America is tremendously good at selling itself on its good aspects.\n\nWe must set up some consultations with Maddison Avenue, Hollywood, and the State Department. If they can convince the world and their own people that America is so perfect and strong, perhaps they can apply their skills to England as well. With some makeup and good lighting, we can make England's problems disappear as well."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_closet_cooperation_desc:0 "We are friends of liberty. WE stand against fascism in all forms, and will do our utmost to protect the world from it. We will not forget our international commitments either. And with that, we shall cooperate with the ORganization of Free Nations. Our forces are ready to help the OFN where it needs it. Our diplomats will stand by the OFN when they must put pressure on other countries. And the OFN can be assured that one country in Europe stands by it in all things."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_the_land_down_under_desc:0 "Australia and New Zealand have been about as far from our minds since the war as they are from London. They have in the meantime cut many of their ties with the former British Empire and are mostly concerned with fending off any Japanese encroachments. Their situation does not involve us in any way, but we will be sure to improve relations with them regardless.\n\nIt's clear they want a reset relationship, and we will give them what they want. They want us to see them as an equal, and we expect them to treat us as the legitimate government of England. Once this is out of the way, we can get along just fine."
ENG_IT_a_simple_game_of_cricket_desc:0 "England and Australia need to begin to rebuild their relationship. One that's more equal and respectful. And isn't sports where respect is earned?\n\nFor a long time, The Ashes were a series of test cricket matches held between Australia and England. Restarting the series will give both England and Australia something to watch, and may improve our respective attitudes towards each other. Television will make these matches more popular than ever before. And we can pitch our country in-between the breaks."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_restoring_old_trade_ties_desc:0 "England has vast industrial potential and a highly skilled workforce. Oceana has wool, mutton, and an amazing amount of raw minerals. It makes sense that we start trading once again. They send us the raw materials that we need, and the ships bring back the finished products they love. Everyone makes money off of this, and both our economies will boom with this trade going on."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_part_of_something_bigger_desc:0 "No more can England be considered a glorified Reichskommisariat. No more do people talk to Germania when they want to talk to London. And no more are we considered a non-factor in world politics. Things have changed, and changed tremendously.\n\nWe have made our return to the world stage. The spotlight is on us. And the audience awaits our next lines. Now we strike the music and begin to perform."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_undermining_the_reich_desc:0 "For far too long, England has been a slave to Germany. A puppet, forced to endure poverty, humiliation, and hardship. And all for the benefit of a few stuck-up barbarians who think a shaky linguistic interpretation of Sanskrit makes them a world conquering master race. Well, their dominion over the English isles is at an end! Now, we begin to take moves that will free us from our bonds with the Hun."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_placating_the_reich_desc:0 "Calm yourself, Germany. We only want a better relationship with you. One that's more equal. We've taken care of ourselves, haven't we? While you and the rest of Greater Germany were losing your heads, we were able to hold onto our position. We do not need any more assistance to stand on our feet. And this certainly doesn't mean we want to rush off and join the OFN, we're still thankful for your guiding hand during those awful years after the war. Now, if you could turn your attention elsewhere for a bit, that would be much appreciated..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_an_arms_deal_desc:0 "How do you show a nation you are committed to their foreign policy goals and are not a threat to them? By purchasing their arms, of course!\n\nWe will contact the Germans and ask if we can buy a bunch of their surplus weapons they no longer need after shooting the rest of the would-be Führers and their supporters. We don't really need the weaponry. But it can show we are acting in good faith, and improve Germania's opinion of us. It can also make Germany think we are potentially still their friend."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_visiting_the_overlord_desc:0 "A full Blitz of Germania is in order. One with aircraft taking off from England to disgorge their payloads on the city. And that payload is diplomats, ministers, officials, and various notables. Our delegation will contact everyone who is anyone in the city and convince them England is their friend. And this will calm tensions a lot. We certainly wish to continue our friendship of nations with mitteleuropa! Surely nobody can deny our sincerity?"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_becoming_our_own_desc:0 "It's time to slip off the chains that have held us to Germany for so long. No longer will we rely on German parts and equipment. Goods in Germany can be produced at home as well. And we don't need their experts anymore. Our economic needs will no longer tie us to the Pakt. Instead, we will now produce what we need by ourselves, further reducing Germany's hold over us."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_distancing_ourselves_from_germany_desc:0 "Our close association with Germany has caused...problems that we would rather not have. Domestically, the people see us as their overlords chosen by the Reich from a pile of Quislings. And the outside world still sees us as the administration of another Reichskommisariat that has gotten too pompous and self-centered. We should change this.\n\nGerman organizations will be quietly removed. Consulates from the Pakt will be closed down to the absolute minimum. And any other reminders of our past relationship will be destroyed or pushed out of sight. Germany is no longer our overlord, and we will make ourselves look like the independent nation we are."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_false_friendship_desc:0 "Hitler said England was not his natural enemy. That the Netherlands and the Belgians could continue to exist peacefully. And that he desired nothing more than peace with his European neighbors. Some believed him. But one does not need any more evidence of the falseness of those statements.\n\nWe say Germany is our friend as well. They believe it. But our words are complete dross. We merely pretend to be their friends to prevent them from taking aggressive action against us. And one day, we might plunge the knife into their back, just like they did for so many others.."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_but_a_profitable_one_desc:0 "Our past history with the Reich has been… troubled, but that does not change the fact that they are not only the largest economy on the Continent, but also wield control over practically all the other economies of the same landmass, with partial exception of the former Triumvirate members. As much as our citizens on the streets may object to and be suspicion of any interaction with the Germans beyond that strictly necessary to maintain the integrity and security of our nation, almost all our economists and business leaders are of one mind. We must open for and encourage trade with the Reich and its puppets if English productive forces are to thrive. The Reichsmark may be covered in blood, but that does not make its value less when exchanged for shiny new Pound sterling."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_our_independence_secured_desc:0 "The days of empire are long past, and yet English ambassadors find that their calls to Washington and Germania are answered increasingly frequently. Our country’s strategic position off of Europe’s shore, while putting at risk from the Reich on the Continent and the Americans in Iceland, also presents us with a diplomatic opportunity. The Americans and the Germans want the honor of dancing with England alone; by dancing with both of them, we will remind them that England is a nation that deserves respect."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_bringing_wales_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The first nation on the Isles to be conquered by the ascendant Kingdom of England in the medieval age, Wales has long detested our supremacy, mounting a strong resistance against us - first through petty kings and rebellions, and then peaceful agitation. Unionist elements in Welsh society still exist, however, and they may be the key to peaceful unification. England and Wales will once again be one - this time hopefully without bloodshed."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_beginning_the_process_desc:0 "The Welsh have accepted our overtures! The path to peace and friendship between our nations lies open, and the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. We are one step closer towards the reunification of Great Britain and a resurgent United Kingdom!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_forcing_them_back_in_desc:0 "The Welsh, in their misguided pride and stubbornness, have rejected our offer. Unfortunately for them, we do not accept refusal. Great Britain will be whole again - and sacrifices must be made for it to happen."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_with_us_once_again_desc:0 "We have done it - Wales is back in the fold, and our goal of uniting the errant former kingdoms of Britain is nearly within our grasp. Welcome back, Welshmen! We are together once again."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_making_it_official_desc:0 "Even though Wales is, de facto, under our control, technically our nations are still separate. The reunification has made quite a legal mess, and we must sort it out before proceeding further - which is why we shall proclaim the Kingdom of England-Wales, standing proud and mighty for all the world to see!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_reunite_with_survivors_desc:0 "When the Huns crossed the channel and set foot upon our fair land, the British Army resisted them on every step of the way. They fought on the beaches, on the landing grounds, in the fields and in the streets, they fought in the hills, and even though they were pushed out of England, they held the line in the north, in Scotland, and they never, ever surrendered.\n\nNow, as the German yoke no longer rests on the English neck, we shall welcome them back, one and all."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_quiet_unification_desc:0 "The situation has developed just as we had hoped - the Scottish government has accepted our offer. There will be no more bloodshed, no more pain - our heroes are coming back home, and all of Scotland with them."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_loud_refusal_desc:0 "We didn't think it would come to this, but reality has surprised us once again - Scotland will not return under the King's reign peacefully. We can speculate on what, or who, made them do this - socialists, foreign agents, nationalist agitators… In the end, it matters not.\n\nScotland will not last."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_together_at_last_desc:0 "As Edinburgh passes from the control of separatists and nationalists into our own hands, the United Kingdom, considered by many to be dead and forever lost to the annals of history, rises anew. Peace returns to the long-suffering island, one built to last. We have proven to all that Britain, however beaten and battered, still has enough strength to stand on its own!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_breaking_them_down_desc:0 "Nationalist, socialist and other traitorous elements of Scottish society still seem to resist our benevolent rule. They attack our soldiers, loot the cities and terrify our citizens. Their terrorist actions endanger the King's peace, and cannot be tolerated!"

ENG_the_new_british_royal_armed_forces_desc:0 "Nobody is really prepared for a massive insurrection, especially one where a sizable number of our units and officers defect. Our men were forced to fight a difficult campaign against their own countrymen, who were armed and supported by major foreign powers. That we won in the end is a significant credit to the armed forces of England, but none of this excuses poor performance.\n\nWe may not want to hear it, but we underperformed in the Civil War. We will find out what went wrong, and fix it immediately. Our next enemy will not be a group of insurgents. And we cannot make mistakes when we face him."
ENG_consult_the_generals_desc:0 "The English Army has now been divided into two distinct doctrinal camps, both of which insist their strategy is the best to defend England is the best way to prevent a German incursion. As always, we really can only support one.\n\nOne faction of the Armed Forces insists a strategy of intense fortification is the way to fend off an invasion. By wearing the Germans down, they say, we would make the cost of an attack on England too much for the Reich. This is folly, say the others. England alone cannot withstand an invasion, we must seek aid from the OFN instead and get their help in our defense.\n\nMany have reservations about working with the ones who supported the rebels just a short while ago, but others say we do not have a choice in the matter."
ENG_never_another_sealion_desc:0 "The most shameful moment in the history of Britain came in 1943, when the first Fallschirmjäger boots touched English soil near Brighton. What came next were years of destruction, humiliation, shame, slavery, and death. We now know the consequences of defeat, and not a man in England will stand for such a disaster again.\n\nEngland held off invaders for 866 years before Sealion. We resolve to do much better than that this time around."
ENG_lessons_from_1943_desc:0 "The largest navy in the world. An air force backed by advanced radar and Spitfires. A massive army using everything at its disposal and multiple lines of permanent fortifications. And the Germans still won. For years, a victimized island has asked "why?"\n\nWell, we'll figure out "why." We're going to get a team together to look through all the documentation of what happened in those fateful months, from British and German sources. We'll figure out just what went wrong, and where those weak links were. They won't be there next time, that's for damn sure."
ENG_a_smaller_but_better_force_desc:0 "The Army won't like it, but it's really the truth. We shouldn't put our efforts into making a massive and bloated defense force made up of every man in England. Rather, we should put our efforts towards making sure our military is as trained and equipped as possible. Our goal isn't to match the Huns on a manpower basis, it's to surpass them on a man-to-man basis. If our soldiers know what they're doing, and they have the tools to do it, it will make them as effective as a force ten times their number. And having a massive amount of fortifications to rely on will help them tremendously as well."
ENG_train_more_reservists_desc:0 "It's simple math, really. The Germans are going to be coming in with large numbers of men. If we don't put up a respectable number of men against them, we lose, and we don't have a respectable number of men to put against them.\n\nReservists must be called up and trained, and the manpower pool will be increased. Everybody that can do the grim task of defending our island from the enemy is going to do so. England expects that every man will do his duty, and they will."
ENG_defend_every_piece_of_land_desc:0 "Let us make it clear to the German that this is not the 1940s, and we are not some Eastern European agrarian backwater. This is England, where we stand ready to defend our land, and have the capabilities to back it up. Every schoolchild can recall our centuries of military triumphs, and we intend to wipe away the shame of 1943 with the blood of Nazi Fallschirmjägers and infantrymen.\n\nEvery beach will have a pillbox. Every field will be guarded by a machine gun nest. Every street will have an AT emplacement at the end of it. Every home will have a squad in it, and every barn will have a sniper in the hayloft. Any advance will take a heavy toll, and we'll see how many lives the Germans will now spend to take our island again."
ENG_strategic_redoubts_desc:0 "The concept of fixed defensive lines is something from the First World War, and quite honestly should stay there. Our defensive fortifications are not going to be thin rings of bunkers and barbed wire across the countryside. As Friedrich the Great once said, "he who defends everything defends nothing."\n\nRather, we will allow the Germans to make advances in select areas of England. The army hates the very idea, but it allows our forces to make stands in more defendable and extremely fortified locations. From there, they can hold off the Germans and make counter attacks as part of a mobile defense strategy."
ENG_simulate_an_invasion_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we are unable to enlist the help of the Wehrmacht in doing a version of their invasion to test our defences. Fortunately, we can do the next best thing. With our knowledge of German tactics and good estimates of their numbers, we can simulate their invasion in an exercise. Computers will help control for variability and other effects.\n\nThe aim of this war game is to test our strategies against an actual invasion. We will see any major flaws in our strategy, so we can correct them. Any successes will be noted as well, especially ones that we did not expect. With our pretend invasion, we will be much more ready for the real thing."
ENG_blow_up_the_panzers_desc:0 "Germany's strength is in their mechanized beasts. They stormed across Europe, sowing death and destruction wherever they went. Our Home Guard had scarcely any defense except jamming logs in their tracks and trying to pour sugar in their gas tanks. This was ineffective, and in many cases suicidal. To make it even worse, the new versions of the Panzers are more armored, better armed, and larger than any model we faced in the invasion.\n\nBut instead of immobilizing, what if we destroy them instead? It certainly is a concept worth putting effort into."
ENG_fortify_the_coasts_desc:0 "Knowing where your enemy is coming from is an incalculable advantage in a fight, and we know where the Germans are coming from; they're coming from the sea. This is a broad front, sure, but it means we can concentrate our efforts in defending a few critical areas and ports to prevent the enemy from sustaining a foothold.\n\nA series of barbed wire, land mines, and just plain fortifications are to be built across the coastline. These will offer our soldiers defendable positions to dig into and protection against enemy fire support. Sure, it sort of ruins the scenery, but we won't be able to enjoy England at all if it's under the jackboot."
ENG_radars_in_the_southeast_desc:0 "In this fight, we need every advantage that can be seized by us. We can create as many tactical and strategic advantages on England as we could, but there is still more that needs to be done. We must know the enemy, and not just be able to match him on paper.\n\nA series of radar stations in the southeast served our nation well in the last war, and they will be expanded in this one. We will see the enemy ships before they ever sight English soil. We will know when a flight of aircraft is coming to attack us well before they arrive over England, and we can listen to the enemy units from far away. When they attack, we will know, and we will be ready to meet them."
ENG_keeping_the_skies_clean_desc:0 "We will never be able to match the Luftwaffe in the air. That's a sad fact, but it's the truth. We lack the aircraft and pilots necessary to stop the enemy from coming over the countryside and attacking where they want. They still have to come over, and so we can make it hard for them.\n\nA series of anti-aircraft batteries unlike anywhere else in the world will make any journey over England fraught with danger. Cannons and missiles await at every potential target and over every route to it. If they want to attack, they have to face these defenses. If they want to neutralize these batteries, they still need to attack. If they don't attack, they cannot win."
ENG_one_step_ahead_of_them_desc:0 "Something we English have always prided ourselves on is our intelligence system. We have placed a premium on finding out all we can about our enemies. Today is no different. MI6 must have people everywhere, throughout the Pakt, in order to find out what we can about an invasion.\n\nOur agents will give us everything we need. They will give us the codes and radio frequencies. They will give us the order of battle. They will give us the plans of the invasion force, and they will give us what's most valuable of all: a date."
ENG_work_with_the_ofn_desc:0 "Some won't admit it, but there is only one force in the world that can provide the necessary force to counter the German Reich. The Americans and their allies have the factories, they have the knowledge, and they have the technology to fight a war against the Hun. We do not.\n\nWe don't expect the Americans to trust us at first. They really have no reason to right now, since we defeated their proxy army a short while ago, but we can earn their trust by showing some of our own. We will offer to work together to show that we are serious about opposing the Reich's designs on our island. In time, they will come to see why our England fights for their cause as well."
ENG_meet_up_with_them_desc:0 "Getting into contact with the United States won't be easy. They have tended to ignore our government, and so have the rest of the OFN. This makes any direct contact with the American president impossible. However, there are some countries that are on speaking terms with us and the OFN, and also have an interest in making sure Germany's plans are frustrated.\n\nWe can send a diplomat to make contact with an American counterpart in a neutral ground, and have him inform the OFN of what we would like them to do. It'll be a tense, awkward conversation. If we can manage to have it, then we can convince them our needs align."
ENG_american_equipment_desc:0 "Everyone can agree that American military equipment is quite splendid. Everyone likes their tanks and infantry equipment, and agree their aircraft are some of the best in the world. Even better, we can get our hands on a bunch of it.\n\nAmerica will send us shipments of material for us to use against the Germans, with the hope we use it well. Some of it is surplus from the last war, but a lot of it is high-tech cutting-edge weaponry that our men will be pleased to use. The Army loves this idea, and will gladly outfit our forces with these weapons."
ENG_american_blueprints_desc:0 "American equipment is all well and good, but is it for the English soldier? We can't rely on foreign suppliers to keep our forces outfitted and supplied. With some technical help, we can guarantee that American weaponry with British characteristics will be used instead.\n\nThe US will send us the necessary blueprints to use for our defense industry, and to improve our domestically-produced weapons. Our generals may be disappointed in this, but British soldiers must have British equipment. The potential benefit to our national arms industry is enormous."
ENG_a_new_way_of_warfare_desc:0 "War has changed since the 1940's. Today's troops move faster, and have far more firepower at their disposal than they did back then. Now that our armed forces are unshackled, we need to catch up to the outside world, and our new friends can give us the skills to do it.\n\nMany books and reports on the recent, mobile actions in South Africa have been written in the United States, and are available in American military schools, and the State Department has agreed to give us their library card. These papers will go to Sandhurst, and every officer will be required to read about these developments, and to have familiarity with how things work in the wars of the present day."
ENG_lessons_from_the_empire_desc:0 "The deserts of Arabia. The jungles of Tanzania. The mountains of the Spīn Ghar. All terrains much harsher than one would find in Britain, and all places where the British Empire fought and won in living memory.\n\nOur empire gave us skills in handling the most extreme types of terrain. There still are men who remember the challenges and hardships these terrains pose, and the solutions they found to keep muddling through. Their knowledge of the worst the world threw at them will help our young men deal with the worst the island can throw at them."
ENG_a_pact_with_the_ofn_desc:0 "We need to recognize that Britain and the OFN have similar needs. We need American technology and equipment. They need bases from which they can get really up close and personal with Germany. Why not help each other?\n\nThey guarantee technology sharing and the occasional delivery of spare equipment for our forces. We can guarantee them bases for their men, and naval facilities to operate from. Everybody gets what they want, and it makes us all very happy. Let's see if they'll agree to this treaty."
ENG_ofn_naval_exercise_desc:0 "It's a sad state of affairs when Britain is not at the cutting edge of naval warfare. Feelings aside, we must recognize where we are. We need to do what is necessary to turn things around and get us back on top.\n\nThe OFN has offered to bring along some of our officers on a naval exercise in the Atlantic. Our men will watch the OFN practice the latest techniques in all aspects of naval warfare. They will bring back their observations and what they learned. This will help us catch up with the aspects of modern naval combat."
ENG_spy_on_the_germans_desc:0 "Of course, we aren't going to forget about the real threat to our country. They are nearby, and we can watch them prepare for the day they attempt to destroy us. However, their proximity and our intelligence apparatus give us a great opportunity to build rapport with the OFN.\n\nMI6 will begin sharing what we learn about Germany with the CIA. They will also feel free to request intelligence that we hold on the Third Reich. Our services will make us invaluable to the United States, and their capabilities will help MI6 in turn."
ENG_airbases_in_the_southeast_desc:0 "When we started planning our air defences in Southern England, we noticed a problem. Many of the airfields were good for the aircraft flying there the last time they were operational, but some experts from the United States believe they are woefully inadequate. For example, F110s and B-52s require longer runways than the P-51s and B-17s did. If we are to operate American aircraft on these fields, massive modernization must take place.\n\nWe will correct this oversight immediately. Construction will begin on longer runways and bigger hangers so we can have airfields that meet the standards for American aircraft. Our goal is to make the area as much a home for American aircraft as it was back during the war."
ENG_a_british_U2_desc:0 "In the last war, our pilots loved the de Havilland Mosquito as a reconnaissance platform. Fast, agile, and good at just about anything you could make it do, it was perfect for sneaking over enemy territory undetected and running off with valuable photos. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to work on something better. Thus, we aren't surprised when the Americans tell us their U-2 can travel higher, faster, and longer.\n\nThe Americans will lend us experts to help develop a U-2 that we can produce domestically and use to gather intelligence. If we end up with anything close to the performance of the U-2 and the value of the Mosquito, we will consider our model a smashing success."
ENG_american_advisors_desc:0 "Among other things the Germans were bad at, they failed to properly help out our military with advisors. It seems they just wanted us to soak up enough Scottish machine gun fire until the Ubermensch could stroll through and win the day. Thus, we have had to rely on our own knowledge to keep our military in shape. The Americans are a lot more generous, however.\n\nUS Army officers will be embedded with our units to provide advice and best practices. Specifically, they will make sure our men are well drilled, our forces are disciplined, and our military efficiency is up to snuff. With their outsider perspective, we can make the British armed forces meet world class standards."
ENG_a_new_royal_navy_desc:0 "Drake's defenders of the Gravelines. Nelson's heroes of Trafalgar. Jellicoe's victors of the Jutland. A group of rusted hulks in the estuary. This is what the war and occupation has done to our navy.\n\nWe will rebuild our vessels. We cannot afford a fleet like the one we had when we had an empire and a roaring economy. Whatever we can afford, however, we will build. Britain's pride and honor demands it. More importantly, our survival relies upon it."
ENG_submarine_warfare_desc:0 "The last time Germany attempted to bridge a massive body of water, it took years and broke their economy in two. It was also less than half the width of the English Channel and nobody was shooting at them on the opposite side. It's safe to say they will be ferrying their men across by sea this time, which gives us an advantage.\n\nA few British submarines in the invasion force will allow us to cause unprecedented amounts of mischief and destruction. We can choke their supply lines, or sever them entirely, guaranteeing us a total victory in the land war. Thus, submarines will play an integral part in our Royal Navy."
ENG_protect_the_supply_lines_desc:0 "It's the same story, over and over again. Britain and Germany are at war. Britain relies on supply convoys from North America to survive. Germany decides they can win the war quickly and easily by just sinking the convoys. They haven't done it before, and we will make sure they won't do it this time, either. We're not going to just hope they sink another Lusitania or Reuben James.\n\nASW ships and destroyers will guard our convoys in the North Atlantic. Our route to the new world will be maintained and never break. We will go toe to toe with Germany's Kriegsmarine once again, and show them they still can't measure up."
ENG_rebuild_the_british_navy_desc:0 "Everything is ready. The technologies are researched. The blueprints are made. Now, we can begin the momentous task. A task that must be done, but a task every Englishman will be glad to take on.\n\nTo the yards, shipbuilders of Britain! We will lay a hull in every slipway, in every town, in every port! The isle will ring with the sound of smashing bottles and new ships sliding into the water! Recruiting stations from Dover to the border will be jammed with men who will sail the Atlantic on new, modern vessels! Let the Hun know that Britannia's charter grants it the seas, and we will defend the approaches to our land as much as the land itself!"
ENG_a_rebuilt_armed_forces_desc:0 "Then? A group of ceremonial units and militia with surplus weaponry. Now? A modern and efficient fighting force. Then? A group of half-sunk ships mothballed in harbors and estuaries. Now? A shining and magnificent fleet of patrol vessels and submarines.\n\nOne may be astonished at how we have quickly turned things around, but they don't know the tenacity of the Briton. We love our land, and are prepared to bore any hardship, make any sacrifice, to keep it. Now, we may rest comfortably that when trouble comes, our lads are capable of handling it."

The forceful dissolution of the United Kingdom has left England without colonies, without access to many trading partners, and bereft of much of our economic prestige which so bolstered our income previously.\n\nEngland did seem to recover somewhat in the aftermath of the war, as the early 1950's were a time of relative prosperity. Yet the collapse of the German economy dealt a blow to the fragile status quo from which it almost could not recover, we were left with massive debts and little way to effectively fund many of our vaunted institutions. Finally, the English Civil War caused immense amounts of destruction which we are still rebuilding from, but now England has stern leadership at her head once more.

The Germans are the largest holder of English bonds bar none, and no matter our desires we cannot afford at the present time to cease trade with a nation which could potentially collapse our economy at any time it chooses.

In fac,t given that we were recently in a civil war of epic proportions, it's amazing that our economy is functioning at all. Regardless, Reginald Maudling and Harold Macmillan intend to use the relatively clean slate that the aftermath of the conflict presents to make some reforms.\n\nThis will be a tricky prospect, as the issues we face are deeply ingrained into the way of life the average Englishman leads at the moment. Issues like low employment and low foreign investment compared to similar nations around the world being amongst the least of our worries.

The Second World War crushed that dominance so thoroughly that it is unlikely to come back in our lifetimes, perhaps not ever.\n\nEnglish industry in the present day is in something of a haphazard state of half-life, with factories shutting down seemingly weekly and unemployment rising like a growing tide. The English Civil War did not help matters whatsoever, with almost half as much destruction as the Second World War again being wreaked upon our industrial base.

We might be tempted to remain neutral, grab as many bargains as we can and keep the money flowing to rebuild our rubbled streets.

The new America is not as foolhardy as it was in the past, but is no less committed to the utter destruction of fascism than it was in the war.

Yet... the concept of \"fast food\" has shown enormous success outside of the United States in formerly British countries, like Canada, Australia, and Scotland.

With the Americans backing the talks, we'll likely find a more equitable agreement than anything we will get on our own. Oh, and perhaps a gesture of friendship - like a treaty of non-hostility - will help sweeten the deal.

This trade will revitalise our economy like nothing before it, the combined disruptions of the English and German Civil Wars can be put in the past. We are a responsible government, those who despised the terms the Reich forced upon our nation but went along with it anyway to save our people.

A cultural exchange programme could do wonders for our perception in Germany, which is something we need to keep an eye on lest we be caught unprepared by the Reich's capricious and ever shifting foreign policy. It won't get us much in the way of funding, but then a love of money was what drove the Royal Party into the corruption which caused the English Civil War.

Perhaps then it is fitting that we use this opportunity to improve relations between our governments as well.\n\nWe can start with small things, invite some of the better German teams over to share a game or two with carefully monitored audiences. Perhaps later on we can have the Prime Minister who up at these games, or at the least Party Leader Macmillan. Our end goal should be some form of binational championship between the leading teams of both our nations, we'll need to ask the Germans about their part in this but it honestly ought not to be so difficult.

Now it is we who need go bowing to the Reich.\n\nInviting the Germans and NOrwegians to a conference on fishing rights is probably the best move. We can make our position and non-hostility clear enough whilst making a show to the world of our independence in making international arrangements. On a purely material level, we gain much from clarifying the fishing agreements with the Reich and its neighbours. Of course we need to make sure we don't lose out in this agreement either, and that will be the challenging part."

Aside from creating jobs enough to mitigate the matter of unemployment to a degree, we'll also be able to increase our independence in regards to finished technical goods as well.

Coal could well be one of the saviours of the English economy given time, and our expanding the mines will in the long term add a not insignificant income to our coffers.\n\nAs in all things however some caution is key, we ought to be careful that coal doesn't take over a supermajority of our economy like it did to the Welsh, leaving us vulnerable to the economic tides that so rarely stay still.

Fixing this will be our next priority.\n\nYet England does not possess enough money to fix everything everywhere, so our efforts will need to be focused if we want them to have proper effect. We could relieve the North, try and get the part of the nation once so closely attached to HMMLR on our side. The Midlands could use the jobs as well, and support there would be useful for United England.

This makes it the perfect test bed for our job creation measures.\n\nIt will be a hard slog to get the citizenry of the North to go along but should we manage it, it is entirely possible we could see the area turn into a bastion of United England support.

We are not the barbaric Germans, heads filled with outdated ideas of racial superiority and chauvinism. This is England, a nation where every man and woman alike will have a shot at success.\n\nOn a more practical note, discrimination on the basis of gender and race in particular negatively effect out economy as otherwise capable individuals are forced against their will to contribute less.

It's barbaric and too German for United England's liking.\n\nThe Women Workforce Act is a project that has been worked upon for several years now, a comprehensive piece of legislation that will forbid discrimination against workers on the basis of sex and forbid pay differentials between men and women for the same work.

ENG_PT_thatcher_a_young_face_for_an_old_system_desc:0 "The English people have rejected stagnation and lunacy in favor of victory! Victory for themselves, victory for their nation... and victory for us.\n\nThe history books will doubtless describe Margaret Thatcher as the first female Prime Minister, but that alone cannot be her legacy. Many refuse to place their trust in a young woman, even one as tenacious as Thatcher, but it is time for drastic change. The stuffy old men who reject leadership shall be left behind in the dirt as the Royal Party hauls England to greater heights. Soon, Thatcher will be a figure of authority for all the world to see."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_ladys_speech_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher must face the English people not as a candidate, but as a Member of Parliament, as the leader of the Royal Party, and most importantly as their Prime Minister. She is to deliver a steely yet brief speech before the black door of 10 Downing Street as the press scramble to take pictures and hurl questions. It is not just the English but the whole world who will witness this speech – and as she well knows, first impressions are the most important."
ENG_PT_thatcher_edward_abdicates_desc:0 "The recent elections were surprising in many ways, not least that they occurred at all. But both our politicians and our populace believed that would be the end of surprises as far as they year went. It would seem that asking for calm is pointless however as our government has just received a rather alarming phone call.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII of the House of Windsor, King of England, has abdicated effective immediately. It is easy enough to understand why he did this, aside from being a man of weak political skills and hated by a rather significant percentage of the population, His Majesty could conceivably be held to be at fault for the events of the recent Civil War to some degree. When that is your legacy is it any wonder a man loses the desire to rule?"
ENG_PT_thatcher_king_henry_takes_the_throne_desc:0 "Edward's abdication does leave us in a bit of a pickle in regards to whom the next monarch shall actually be, the former King having no heir of his own blood. Obviously the American puppet Elizabeth cannot be allowed to accede to the throne, but there is yet one Windsor from the children of George V left untainted by incompetence.\n\nHenry the Duke of Gloucester has remained out of the political spotlight for the past decades, ignoring both our and his niece's government in favor of charity work. He is our only legitimate successor to Edward VIII, and though he might dislike the idea of becoming monarch, we can remind him of all the strife England might avoid if he did his duty. The former King aside, the Windsors are a reliable family after all."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_crown_falls_silent_desc:0 "It seems that England cannot catch a break on the matter of its Kings. Whilst travelling back from a charity function, His Majesty Henry IX suffered a debilitating stroke that has rendered him bedridden. Despite our hopes, doctors have informed us that the King will leave hospital care as a quadriplegic - hardly in any condition to rule the country!\n\nThis is a disastrous situation, but as a nation we are capable of recovering from it. Our first action now should be to decide who shall act as His Majesty's regent, and from there consult the line of succession. If our current luck holds, we will be in need of its guidance sooner rather than later."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_prince_regent_desc:0 "William the Prince of Wales is a rather sensible lad. Young but not overly so, and more importantly agrees with us on the matter of England's ideal government - to a greater degree than his incapacitated father, even. This is good, as the Prince will assume his position relatively soon.\n\nFor now however, William of the House of Windsor will simply act as Prince-Regent of England, primarily substituting for His Majesty in his supposed appearances within England and without. We ought to be thankful to some extent; regency will help immeasurably in acquainting the young prince with the duties of a king."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "King Henry IX, a noble man of strength, virtue, determination and duty shunned by most, has breathed his last. With his death marks the passing of His Majesty George V's last child, furthermore prompting the accession of England's seventh monarch this century.\n\nAll Hail King William V, who has borne the duties and burdens of the Crown. Only a strong hand can marshal the nation's strength in these troubling times, and the new King will assist our government in keeping such will at our policies' forefronts. Fortune willing, he shall reign for many decades yet - perhaps even reign over Britain reborn. But whatever changes the world's turning shall brook, England shall forever shout:\n"God save the King!""
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_discord_may_we_bring_harmony_desc:0 "The upper echelons of society have had strong ties to the Royal Party since before the tragedy that was the English Civil War. In its aftermath, however, even the nation's elite have been thrown in chaos. If we are to change the direction of England for the better, we should reconcile with the minority responsible for sustaining governments and keeping parties alive. Perhaps it is time we weighed our options..."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_speech_blitz_in_london_desc:0 "Many still believe that public oration is a task fit only for a male, booming voice. To put paid to this laughable assertion, Prime Minister Thatcher will sweep London with a blitz of speeches aimed at the country's elite and privileged. Royalists, aristocrats, giants of industry... the Iron Lady's own voice will make sure they understand her own government's place for them."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_aristocrats_know_nothing_about_england_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher has decided to unleash her inner populist. The Prime Minister will begin to challenge the elite of the nation, accusing them of engaging in corruption and harboring disdain for the average citizen. While the Royal Party will protest against this rhetorical direction, it is a message for the people – and the people will hear it."
ENG_PT_thatcher_and_who_are_you_that_i_must_bow_so_low_desc:0 "In a move certain to infuriate the upper ranks of the Royal Party, Thatcher will openly attack powerful members thereof with strong ties to the government. The common people will love this, viewing it as a brave stance against elitism and the influence of unelected figures in our broken system. It will be a display of loyalty towards the citizens, and spite towards the elite."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_workplace_corruption_act_desc:0 "As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. If the people are to be convinced of our populist struggle against the elite, we must prove that we are willing to act upon it. The Workplace Corruption Act will fight against corruption benefiting the rich and powerful within the workplace, from nepotism to insidious backroom deals. Naturally, their confusion at our behavior will twist into fury, but this will only benefit us in the long run."
ENG_PT_thatcher_looking_in_the_new_industries_desc:0 "The growth of cutting-edge sectors these last few years, in particular computer engineering, have introduced the world of business to young, fresh-faced CEOs - polar oppsites of established captains of industry. Thatcher can easier envision herself working hand-in-hand with England's new nouveau riche than with the staid men decades their senior in wealth, influence, and above all corruption."
ENG_PT_thatcher_calming_the_old_guard_desc:0 "As the Prime Minister expected, our current populist course of action has sparked fury amongst the Royal Party's Old Guard, whose cries of protestation have since transformed into anger. In order to placate these esteemed gentlemen and secure their tenuous support, Thatcher will quell their fears through private conversations at times and places of their choosing."
ENG_PT_thatcher_we_must_learn_to_work_with_everyone_desc:0 "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will present an open hand for the country's elite to hold onto, allowing them influence in the direction of the Party. we will appease their desire for power while simultaneously utilizing their usefulness through such display of friendship. Unfortunately, the average citizen will take our two-facedness regarding the Old Guard Royalists with scorn, but it is the direction we must take for the sake of stable, efficient government."
ENG_PT_thatcher_dining_with_the_high_class_desc:0 "Thatcher shall meet with members of the upper class aristocracy throughout England in an attempt to align their support towards the Royal Party. Rather than expensive, overbearing wastes of time, the Prime Minister instead sees in the gentry's dinners and balls opportunities to befriend and glean information from her new allies."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_meeting_in_liverpool_desc:0 "The support of the aristocracy is not enough. In a meeting room in Liverpool, the Prime Minister will meet with giants of industry and powerful magnates to earn their cooperation. If they are willing to listen to the government's terms, then we shall be happy to negotiate policy with them."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_business_protection_act_desc:0 "Soon to be passed by Parliament, the Business Protection Act will deliver definite tax breaks for certain businesses and open exploitable loopholes for the rest. Though we are presenting this bill as another step towards revitalizing the English economy, the public will not be as convinced of its benefits as the elites and Royalist Old Guard who helped draft it."
ENG_PT_thatcher_talking_to_the_people_desc:0 "It is inevitable that the public will view the Business Protection Act as the government bending to the will of the omnipotent Elite. To prevent such negative conceptions from taking root among our voters, Margaret Thatcher will engage in earnest dialogue with them via all known mediums at the government's disposal. A good word may just mean the difference between idle grumbling and bloody protest."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_error_may_we_bring_truth_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher finds her career teetering atop a knife's edge. On one end, the Old Guard of the Royal Party despise her for what she is: a woman of humble origins daring to assert her power. At the other end lies the Opposition, who absolutely despise her for what she does - that being, everything they wouldn't.\n\nPolitics is a game of balance, power and popularity. The Prime Minister will strengthen her support and power bases before it's too late."
ENG_PT_thatcher_but_where_to_focus_desc:0 "The future of Thatcher's policy lies before her, splitting off into two distinct directions. She can either focus her energy on expanding her support within the Royal Party, or striking the Opposition and crushing its relevance and popularity. Perhaps, if she is lucky, she could achieve both..."
ENG_PT_thatcher_targeting_the_opposition_desc:0 "United England is a cluster of wet traitors, while the lunatic thugs of the National Front can barely string a sentence together without exploding into fascist rants. The Opposition parties must be dealt with, their reputation shredded and scattered to the wind - and Thatcher will strike them where it hurts."
ENG_PT_thatcher_would_you_care_to_answer_some_questions_mauding_desc:0 "The Right Honorable Reginald Maudling is a different kind of politician from the rabble of United England. Unlike the staunchly conservative Macmillan, Maudling flaunts his liberal leanings. Unlike the treacherous Powell, Maudling stayed with England during the Civil War. Exposing his party's weaknesses is only a matter of asking him questions pertinent to his steadfastly-held ideals - specifically, ideals whose utterance may invoke a dissimilar reaction from some of his own partymen."
ENG_PT_thatcher_cracking_the_UE_desc:0 "We have discerned from Maudling that United England is united only in name. A deep chasm has opened up between the two rival factions within: the conservative Macmillanists and Maudling's liberals. Exploiting this weakness by sowing the seeds of division - bribes, rumors, blackmail - will let the party collapse into petty infighting, all while the public watches aghast at seeing their representatives stoop so low in broad daylight."
ENG_PT_thatcher_blaming_the_NF_for_our_problems_desc:0 "The sheer incompetence of the National Front makes them our easiest target. These fascists were overwhelmingly rejected by the English public during the elections, and their leadership is rife with infighting between the dying Chesterton's 'English Fascists' and Jordan's insane 'English National Socialists'. By pinning all problems in English politics and English society as a whole on the National Front, the people's fury will shift from us to a most convenient scapegoat."
ENG_PT_thatcher_question_time_in_parliament_desc:0 "Prime Minister's Questions is approaching, and it looks set to be the most dramatic one of Thatcher's premiership. United England are furious with our actions, and the National Front's hatred towards us has increased tenfold.\n\nThatcher, however, is an orator and debater of considerable merit. Let's see what these fools have to throw at the Iron Lady."
ENG_PT_thatcher_clearing_the_way_desc:0 "The Old Guard of the Royal Party consider Margaret Thatcher to be little more than a puppet dancing to their tune, but they may have miscalculated. The power of the Prime Minister is not to be scoffed at, and Thatcher will use her new-found power to her absolute advantage."
ENG_PT_thatcher_new_young_faces_in_the_party_desc:0 "Some of the men in our Party are well past their prime. To appeal to the masses, perhaps it would be wise to replace the older (and more rebellious) Royalists with younger parliamentarians. These fresh-faced politicians would likely be ardent Thatcherists - by pure coincidence, of course."
ENG_PT_thatcher_explain_it_to_the_higher_ups_desc:0 "The Old Guard demand explanations for the sudden removal of older politicians in favor of younger, loyal Royalists. Expecting such protestation, Thatcher has prepared a convincing excuse: those removed had clandestinely supported Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance."
ENG_PT_thatcher_shaking_up_the_party_desc:0 "It is time to end the influence of the Old Guard. The Prime Minister will dramatically shake up the Royal Party by firing its most elite members on accusations of HMMLR sympathies, replacing them all with ardent Thatcherites who will abide by her every word and hence establish true government unity."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_annual_party_meeting_desc:0 "The Royal Party is preparing for their annual meeting, and the Old Guard are naturally furious at their leader for her recent actions. If the Prime Minister is to increase her support within her party, she must demonstrate the ability to prove her worth before her detractors."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_doubt_may_we_bring_faith_desc:0 "Many of England's citizens remain distrustful of the Royal Party despite its clear-cut victory last election, to say nothing of their own Prime Minister. By no means are we ignorant of the ugly wounds the war had left on Englishmen's trust; regardless, stitching them is a must if we plan on bringing the country back to its feet."
ENG_PT_thatcher_touring_the_nation_desc:0 "The solution to our unpopularity is obvious: a grand tour of England to rally support for the Royal Party, by meeting those we strive to serve Margaret Thatcher will initiate - and obtaining some excellent photo opportunities along the way."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focusing_on_the_poor_north_desc:0 "The north of England, as ever, is rife with the apathetic and anti-Royalist working class. To obtain their trust and support, Thatcher must talk to the common northerner and entice them with grandiose promises."
ENG_PT_thatcher_speak_up_and_judge_fairly_desc:0 "As a conservative Christian woman, Margaret Thatcher understands the nuances and power of faith, and how it can rally the masses together. Securing the trust of the working classes will require giving them such faith - that is, faith in a brighter future."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focusing_on_the_rich_south_desc:0 "While southern England generally supports our aims, apathy remains rampant among much of its voter base. We must cultivate a culture of Royalist support among the southerners, and to do so requires earnest, continuous display of support from the government."
ENG_PT_thatcher_money_in_the_bank_and_a_vote_in_the_ballot_desc:0 "Merely touring the south will not suffice for a prosperous, thriving Royal Party. We could secure greater funding from the public if we increased our propaganda initiatives in rich areas of the south and appealed to their cultural sensibilities."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_next_desc:0 "The tour continues, but Thatcher must soon decide on how best to proceed with her campaigning: should she present herself to the media, or to the people directly?"
ENG_PT_thatcher_media_blitz_desc:0 "Fully utilizing modern mass media technology will allow us to reach almost every ear in the country. With her usual oratory wit, the Prime Minister will give numerous interviews and announcements through the telly and the radio, additionally saving us precious hours otherwise spent meeting citizens in person."
ENG_PT_thatcher_permanent_campaign_desc:0 "By design, modern politics eschews entertaining weak-willed men content to campaign only in a prescribed season of a prescribed year. The English people must be constantly reminded of what the Royal Party is doing to help them. To accomplish this, we will set up a permanent campaign apparatus so we can better and more frequently communicate our plans to the masses."
ENG_PT_thatcher_face_to_face_with_the_people_desc:0 "The Prime Minister will meet with various English communities, delivering speeches and engaging in private conversations, in an attempt to understand their personal situations and provide solutions to the issues they raise."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_despair_may_we_bring_hope_desc:0 "It is not the landed elite who matter most in English society, nor is it the Old Guard or the nouveau riche; rather, it is John Smith the humble workingman, stevedore, farmer, and more besides. Margaret Thatcher needs their support to strengthen her hold over the ship of state. While some may decry this as petty populism, the Prime Minister believes it the only path to truly uniting the country."
ENG_PT_thatcher_on_who_to_focus_desc:0 "The question stands: which class do we funnel our entire efforts and money into persuading? Bringing the lower class out of its apathy could benefit us greatly, though it would infuriate the Old Guard Royalists. Rallying the middle class behind our cause, however, will not create the same level of populist zeal, but won't be so frowned upon by our moneyed allies."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_lower_class_needs_our_help_desc:0 "We have decided to bring the lower class into the fold. Enticing them fully to the Royal Party will admittedly be difficult, least of all due to... cultural discrepancies, so to say. But take heart, for our efforts will be repaid by a legion of loyal voters at our beck and call."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_middle_class_has_our_back_desc:0 "We have decided to bring the middle class into the fold. While they are not as large a voting bloc as the lower class, swaying them to the ideals of the Royal Party will not prove to be as difficult."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_housing_act_desc:0 "The lower class needs homes, and our proposed Housing Act will ensure that at least five million council house tenants will have the legal right to buy a house from their respective local authorities."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_new_healthcare_act_desc:0 "The New Healthcare Act plans to provide basic government funding towards our healthcare system, and to boost healthcare opportunities for those who had paid the most for England's survival in its most recent conflict."
ENG_PT_thatcher_battling_unemployment_desc:0 "One of the greatest scourges facing this nation is unemployment. We cannot claim to represent the English people, or boost our economy, if we cannot provide job opportunities for our most vulnerable citizens."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focus_on_rural_areas_desc:0 "We shall focus our efforts on the plight of our destitute farmers. While there are admittedly less unemployed in our rural areas, we can easier create jobs for them than for our city folk. Quick land grants appease the English public faster than comprehensive housing reform, after all."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focus_on_urban_areas_desc:0 "The cities of England shall receive our full attention. It will of course be harder to create jobs in urban areas of the country, but the unemployment figures are far greater - much like the Party's support of this direction."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_peoples_pm_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher has demonstrated to the English people that, under her populist premiership, the Royal Party will support the needs of the common people over the demands of society's elite, and the Party's Old Guard. Long live Maggie!"
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_iron_lady_of_the_isles_desc:0 "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has exceeded all expectations following her rise to power, and cemented her position as the Iron Lady. Her tactics in consolidating control of the Royal Party and dealing with society at large has raised her to the status of one of the strongest politicians in the British Isles. Only time will tell what her future plans are."

Furthermore, we will support our nation's great farmers with subsidies to help them not just grow the most bountiful harvests ever, but expand to as-of-yet untilled land, creating more than enough food for all! Finally, we must ensure grocery stores like that of Maggie's youth don't waste their supplies: instead of throwing out surplus goods, they shall be distributed to the food banks and be distributed immediately. After all these measures, it is not at all fantasy to believe that England can fully eradicate hunger!"

What? You're \"principled\"? What about the principle of owning a beautiful home in the Highlands? Excuse me, now you say that you'll launch an investigation? Are you sure you want to?\n\nAh, now you're investigating us. Funny, seems we have evidence that you own the Communist Manifesto along with stacks of lewd American magazines. We \"planted\" those? The Lord knows if you lie, as will our courts. See how much easier it would've been to take a Scottish manor? Your insolence instead brings you to a penitentiary south of London."

But thanks to some of our newfound support, along with our powerful security apparatus, they will no longer be a problem.\n\nPolitics is nothing but war with a friendly face, and our foes have twiddled their thumbs across the ridge rather than charge when they had the chance. Now the initiative is ours, and they will be shattered to bits. Any libelous newspaper they wish to print? Kindling. MPs speaking against us in public? Sedition. Hardliners still scheming, trying to walk a tightrope and vote us out in the House of Commons? As they will soon learn, we can make anyone seem traitorous if we'd like."

Alas, we cannot truly know what they are planning unless they are fully under our command. Thus, we must pass the Leash Act in the name of national unity.\n\nThis Act will not liquidate our opposition, nor criminalize them. What it does is ensure that their activities are entirely aligned with the national interest. No meeting will go through without our approval and careful surveillance, no vote will be made without our consultation.

To think that some envision us as Marxists!\n\nAll shall be resolved in quick measure. We are more than happy to pull favors for the old money that helped build up this country, as are we to the outside companies who so generously invested in this rising power. They will be assured that we aim to provide for the poor no more than the most basic of assistance, for we are nothing if not proponents of individual effort. We will also remind them that we have been more on the side of job creators than any past leader, and they have nothing but prosperity ahead of them when our party unites.

Enter the Unions Act.\n\nOnce it passes, a union will be entirely illegal. No man shall grow wealthy by funneling their hard earned wages into a bloated bureaucracy. Without this theft, unions will flounder to nothing. Anyone found guilty of trying to organize their co-workers (or rather, take advantage of them) shall not only be fired, but immediately tried for sedition and menacing. We know how such "organizers" operate, and we shall treat them in such vile ways as they have treated workers.

Rather, it was internal strife and malaise that had brought so much suffering onto the British people. We must recognise that a similar situation may still develop, and that we must do whatever we can to prevent it.\n\nEvery block must have a police officer to remind the people the law is never far away. Every street must have a camera to see what our officers do not. And every town must have people ready to enforce the law and stamp out any dissidents before they take root. The Civil War showed what we were doing wasn't enough, and we will do far more now."

Why, expand their ranks and increase their pay of course!\n\nAt least, that's one way of thinking. While we would like to fund everything to the max, the economy's tepid shape precludes us from doing so for now.

We should consider arming our officers to meet this threat.\n\nMilitary equipment will give our officers the tools to handle any problem, and provide a degree of intimidation as well.

Lawbreaking has thus been rampant in certain sections of our country.\n\nThe solution is simple. If there are too many crimes for the police to handle, we add more police.

ENG_MT_thatcher_army_reforms_desc:0 "The English Civil War exposed many problems with our country, the Royal Army included; in some battles, its performance was lackluster at best. In many cases its methods and equipment have barely progressed since the end of the Second World War.\n\nIt is imperative that we learn from our mistakes, and reform our army so that it will be sufficiently prepared for any future engagements. However, we must also keep in mind the prejudices harbored by senior officers who would prefer a return to the grand old army that lost us against the Germans in the first place."
ENG_MT_thatcher_offensive_efforts_desc:0 "By the War's end, the Army faced numerous issues in dealing with stubborn rebel holdouts. As a result of these failings, we lost far more good soldiers than we needed to. All of the issues with our current offensive capabilities have been made glaringly clear, and they will have to be fixed if our men are to stand a chance of surviving their next offensives."
ENG_MT_thatcher_armed_police_desc:0 "Our army needs more men. Unfortunately, the Civil War drained us of them. We will never be able to properly defend England from invaders unless we address this shortage - one which our boffins might just address.\n\nBy incorporating the police as an integral part of our homeland defense, we can greatly increase the amount of reserves available to the army whilst ensuring better security within our border."
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_spec_ops_desc:0 "Training professional soldiers specially trained in asymmetrical warfare would make invading England a much harder task than it currently is. These new Special Forces would be an effective use of our limited resources, in contrast to sending our men to proverbial meat grinders. We should learn from our mistakes, not replicate them on a larger scale."
ENG_MT_thatcher_chieftain_tank_desc:0 "We need to supply our armed forces with new, up-to-date tanks to compete with other would-be opponents. Focusing on the development of the promising Chieftain Tank should be our priority if we are to achieve this goal. This valuable addition to the Army's stores will help us stand toe to toe against even the most advanced armor the rest of the world has to offer."
ENG_MT_thatcher_fv432_apc_desc:0 "Producing tanks may seem like a good idea on the surface, yet the fact of the matter is that we merely do not have the resources, nor the industrial capacity, to spare for such lumbering hulks.\n\nArmored personnel carriers, particularly the encouraging FV43 design, are better and cheaper alternatives to the expensive and ineffective tanks we would otherwise produce. We must be honest with ourselves; tanks may be a prestigious addition to our military, but it would be irresponsible to believe that we could manufacture enough to genuinely threaten the likes of the Germans."
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_royal_marines_desc:0 "England has always prided herself in her brave and able Royal Marines. In the days when Britannia ruled the waves, a feared and noble force in equal measure. Reinvigorating our Marines will not only increase the overall strength of our armed forces, but also restore some of the old esteem our army once held. After all, we were powerful once. Why not use our history to restore our rightful place in the present?"
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_self_propelled_guns_desc:0 "What we need is firepower, plain and simple. We can hearken back to the past all we like, but that will not help us as much as modern artillery would. New self-propelled guns will give us a huge advantage over our enemies, as well as providing our army with the means to rain salvos upon them with the maneuverability and accuracy they desperately need. The more of these we order, the better."
ENG_MT_thatcher_military_industry_desc:0 "Our military industry is somewhat lacking at the moment. Weapons manufacturing is inefficient and our army is suffering because of it.

ENG_MT_thatcher_defensive_efforts_desc:0 "Now that all the rebel guns have been silenced throughout England, we now have time to properly prepare our country's defenses. Yet there is still much to be done before fair Albion is amply defended from its foes. We will have to make several decisions, but whatever we choose to do we must be certain that it will keep our people safe.\n\nThe defense of our homeland must be prioritised before anything else. Not for nothing is "Never another Sealion" a slogan shared by Englishmen regardless of politics."
ENG_MT_thatcher_elite_army_desc:0 "We shall take steps to turn the Royal Army into the most well-trained and organized of its kind on Earth. Shaping the Royal Army into an elite, world class force will incur some hefty costs, but the strength they entail will soon be worth the sacrifice.\n\nThe country needs an army flexible enough to contain any invader, to protect its borders and safeguard the people."
ENG_MT_thatcher_trench_training_desc:0 "If England is ever invaded again, we will have to be prepared to hold fortified positions to stop any attackers in their tracks. Entrenching ourselves in static positions would ensure that the Germans would have a harder time fighting us should they dare invade a second time.\n\nThis worked for us to some extent in the Great War, so why should we not refine it for the modern age? It would certainly be a cheaper method than training all of our soldiers to an impossibly high standard."
ENG_MT_thatcher_artillery_equipment_desc:0 "Our army experienced a constant shortcoming of available firepower many times in the Civil War. Bringing our artillery up to a modern standard would improve the strength of our army no end, and gives us a key advantage over our opponents.\n\nUltimately, our army needs heavy weapons more than it needs better infantry."
ENG_MT_thatcher_small_arms_equipment_desc:0 "Improving our ineffective infantry should always be our utmost concern. The Army will last in protracted combat only as long as its men. Hence we will prioritize offering weapons and skills necessary to defend England alongside the King's shilling.\n\nEvery man must learn to fight to the best of his ability, in case total war comes a-knocking in our lifetimes."
ENG_MT_thatcher_anti_air_equipment_desc:0 "One of the most terrifying aspects of Sealion was the extensive, ruinous damage done by the Luftwaffe's bombers. Now their air raids have been made even more destructive thanks to new technology, and their fighters still outclass our own.\n\nWe have no choice but to build additional anti-air emplacements across the country. Only then shall our cities and airfields be sheltered from the Luftwaffe's fell talons. This may seem to be an overly pessimistic view to some; then again, they're better off safe from aerial bombardment than submerged in sorry and rubble."
ENG_MT_thatcher_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The best way to defend England is to defend its coast. Sealion demonstrated many of our failings in that regard, least of all our overreliance in the Royal Navy. Swept aside by the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe, our sinking ships could but only watch helplessly as Germans scale Dover's pristine cliffs.\n\nBy necessity, Englishmen must be quick to adapt. Thus the way forward lies with emplacements keeping watch over every grain of sand on England's shores. More fool the man who dares assail an impregnable island fortress."
ENG_MT_thatcher_doctrinal_advances_desc:0 "After months spent rectifying the flaws in our antiquated equipment and tactics, we can finally begin the laborious process of integrating them into the armed forces' modernized doctrines. The English Army will have clear plans in place for any future war, ones which guarantee swift victory against the hubris of would-be conquerors. Our people can now rest well with the knowledge that their homeland is again protected by a mighty bulwark, oaken or steely - and should it find use in the future, without the weaknesses that had doomed its predecessor."
ENG_MT_thatcher_rebuild_royal_navy_desc:0 "Today the Royal Navy is a shadow of its former self. This was not the case a mere generation ago; then it was the very symbol of the British Empire's power and majesty, securing its expansive waters and protecting its every subject wherever corner of the globe they set foot upon.\n\nAlas, much of it now exists only as scrap metal in Davy Jones' Locker - and in the hearts of those who yearn for a past unjustly ended. Our newfound largesse in mind, they insist that the time has come to remind the world of an old English paean's lines:\n\n"Britannia rules the waves!""
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_focus_desc:0 "The introduction of aircraft carriers signalled a paradigm shift in modern sea power. Where before control of vital sea lanes were decided by burnished rows of becannoned special treatment steel, the Second World War proved that even the mightiest battleships were fatally humbled by torpedo salvos from planes a bare fraction of its size. Thus every superpower worth the title now possesses aircraft carriers, ever vital for projecting their strength thousands of miles from their shores.\n\nAircraft carriers are key to bringing the Royal Navy into the post-war era, no matter what some maimed sea dogs clamor."
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_screen_ships_desc:0 "Our new carrier will require adequate protection once it leaves its berth. Far be it for us to leave a floating island worth £3 million unprotected.\n\nHence, MoD has ordered several cruisers from our shipyards. These and the carrier will soon form the crux of the new Royal Navy - and a well-protected one, at that." 
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_support_ships_desc:0 "A carrier can not sink an entire navy on its own, much as we would prefer so. It needs an ample complement of vessels capable of contributing firepower to the fleet it's assigned.\n\nIn its prescience, the Royal Navy's budget for the year included new cruisers and submarines: ships very much built with firepower in mind. With these we can prove, should the occasion arise, that England can match its foes toe-to-toe in the open sea."
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_ship_construction_desc:0 "With the prerequisite paperwork and funds set in order, our shipyards can now begin construction of the Royal Navy's newest aircraft carrier. Their workers will labor tirelessly to ensure its christening at the soonest possible date.\n\nThe Royal Navy's strength will increase manyfold after its commission, along with England's global reach. All creatures of sky and sea will learn that the Royal Navy shall soon return to its rightwise berth high above them."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Britain has always prided itself on its battleships, the greatest of which were the jewels in the Royal Navy's coronet. They were the behemoths that protected our seas at Jutland, and valiantly fought the Axis until they could no longer stay afloat.\n\nSome within MoD openly harbor an obsession over 'modernizing' Britain's most noble institution, and insist on constructing floating airstrips over the legacies of Nelson, Fisher and Jellicoe. Pure folly of course: the English people needs pride and prestige, not staid attempts at progress.\n\nAnd a mighty battleship has pride and prestige aplenty."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_screen_ships_desc:0 "We must make sure our new battleship will be well protected. England at this stage, if ever, can ill afford its fleet's latest pride sharing the Hood's fate in the future; with the leaps submarine technology have enjoyed as of late, it may well do so in the event of a shooting war.\n\nHence, the Royal Navy has procured several ASW-capable destroyers which will see service within the next decade."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_cruisers_desc:0 "As its firepower is sadly limited, our battleship will need several cruisers to help support it. They may not be as prominent as a battleship, but they will nevertheless form an indispensable part of the Royal Navy's fleet. Any adversary will think twice before drawing the torrential ire of our battleship and cruisers' shells."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_construction_desc:0 "With the prerequisite paperwork and funds set in order, our shipyards can now begin construction of the Royal Navy's newest capital ship. Their workers will labor tirelessly to ensure its christening at the soonest possible date.\n\nOne dissenting soul, however, raised a unique dissention during the planning phase. Rather than building one ginormous battleship, he said, the Royal Navy would be better served adopting in part the late Admiral Jellicoe's vision: two battlecruisers, less armed and armored but more agile than a lumbering battleship,\n\nWhichever option we choose, England's oldest bulwark will assuredly see its presence known once more."
ENG_MT_thatcher_naval_doctrine_advances_desc:0 "Having commissioned the ships just recently leaving drydock, the Royal Navy can now prioritize planning how best to use them at sea. This entails extensive revisions to its existing battle plans and tactics.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made however, it won't be long before the reinvigorated Royal Navy revisits a sliver of its mythical past. Sally forth from old England's channel, hearts of oak, and with your foghorns sound Britannia's return as a power without peer!"
ENG_MT_thatcher_rebuild_royal_airforce_desc:0 "Ever since its disastrous performance in the Second World War, the Royal Air Force has been left to wither and rot in decripit airstrips across England. A sorry state indeed for an armada thought beyond its time before the Luftwaffe tore it to shreds.\n\nIn agreement with the Ministry of Defense, the Thatcher administration pleges to rebuild the RAF into a state worthy of protecting England's heavenly main. It will hopefully do better than it had in 1943 after all is said and done."
ENG_MT_thatcher_harrier_programme_desc:0 "Disposing slow, ungainly, and antiquated fighters is part and parcel of securing England's skies. In lieu of old Spitfires and Meteors, a consortium of English defense contractors have designed a promising jet plane labelled the "Harrier", far superior to either (and the equal of its foreign contemporaries) in specifications. The Defense Minister recommends expediting development thereof as much as we can.\n\n"Second life" is no exaggeration for the effects our first Harrier wings will provide to the RAF. In good time, the world will soon fear England's very own bird of prey. "
ENG_MT_thatcher_raf_bases_desc:0 "Most of the airbases dotting England's emerald hills are haphazard constructs built in a frenzy before Sealion. It stands to reason that a fair share lost their purpose after 1943. Dirt runways and ramshackle sheds may suffice for biplanes - but not for modern jet fighters with appetite and temperament overflowing.\n\nNew, larger air bases will be built to accommodate our future air fleet. Modern dogfighting favors a preponderance of runways and supply stores over a glut of airbases in the term's loosest definition; after all, the more fighters we can fly at any time, the likelier we establish aerial supremacy before the enemey does."
ENG_MT_thatcher_jet_engine_innovation_desc:0 "One among the Royal Air Force's biggest issues is its obsolescence in the age of jet. The Harrier has been an encouraging start, but more will have to be done. Most of our research on jet engines has not progressed far beyond the standards of 1943 considering we heretofore lacked the knowledge, and more importantly the funds, to meaningfully proceed in its relevant avenues.\n\nThis must be rectified posthaste. Let us jump head-first into a new age by building a jet industry of our own."
ENG_MT_thatcher_vtol_stol_desc:0 "England's runways have become antiquated and unsuited to the demands of most modern fighter jets. Rather than reinventing the airbase at ruinous cost, MoD instead recommends retrofitting our new Harriers with vertical take-off and landing engines. The capability to leave base without a long runway will ensure the continued use of much of our WW2-era airstrips."
ENG_MT_thatcher_harrier_missiles_desc:0 "Another aspect of aerial combat in which we fall short is weaponry. Foreign fighters are equipped with devastatingly powerful missiles capable of turning aircraft into bits of molten slag mid-flight. Equipping our Harriors with some of the world-class missiles our boffins have developed is an unquestionable must."
ENG_MT_thatcher_modernise_radar_desc:0 "Before and during the Second World War, British research and implementation of radar systems was unparalleled worldwide. We fervently believed the techology was our war-winning weapon against the Hun. Though undeniably useful, it proved insufficient in sealing our fate.\n\nHowever, modernizing our old radar systems would once again give us an edge over our enemies. We will have to be open to such improvements for the sake of free English skies."
ENG_MT_thatcher_pilot_training_desc:0 "The RAF suffered from a dearth of pilots throughout the Second World War. Doubtless those we had finagled may have been some of the bravest men in Britain, but truly skilled aviators were few and far between.\n\nThus far England is incapable of maintaining an air force equal in count to that of the Germans, Americans and Japanese, and so must rely on each its fighter pilots' skill more than the world's three superpowers. Every possible effort must be made to ensure that they are the best in the world."
ENG_MT_thatcher_air_doctrinal_advances_desc:0 "Having made several advances in updating the Royal Air Force, there is no doubt that our doctrine requires updating. After all, there would be no point in improving our air force if none of our strategies were updated too. Efficiency must be assured if we are to properly defend against the Luftwaffe.\n\nSoon the RAF will reclaim England's skies. We pray they remain clear forevermore."

ENG_ET_thatcher_grocer_daughter:0 "The Grocer Daughter"
ENG_ET_thatcher_grocer_daughter_desc:0 "Prime Minister Thatcher inherits the legacy of her entrepreneuring father Alfred Roberts. Without an open free market, he would've simply toiled until the grave, living off the government dole. Instead, he was able to take the leap into starting a successful grocer's shop that left the family quite comfortable. The tragedy of Britain then, is that of fascist regulations, of constant barriers to success.\n\nEvery man should be able to supply goods and services, free of burdensome taxes and arbitrary regulations. Margaret Thatcher learned everything she needed to know from hard work and personal responsibility alongside the joy of serving her father's business. Soon, all of Britain will again be a nation of entrepreneurs."
ENG_ET_thatcher_introducing_thatcherism:0 "Introducing Thatcherism"
ENG_ET_thatcher_introducing_thatcherism_desc:0 "The typewriters in Downing Street have been operating at a furious clip, as PM Thatcher readies the most critical address of her premiership. Before Parliament, she will outline the future of the English economy; the broad slashing of taxes and regulations known to both friend and foe as "Thatcherism". Given that her power in government has been largely cemented, little blowback from the addresses is anticipated."
ENG_ET_thatcher_controlling_cash:0 "Controlling Cash"
ENG_ET_thatcher_controlling_cash_desc:0 "We inherit a ravaged landscape, where the pound seems to shed value every day and nary a street corner can be turned without finding someone asking for work. Under Thatcher, a bold new solution is clear that requires no concessions to communistic government programs. With the erratic value of our currency being the core of the nation's ills, it must be brought to heel like the rabid dog it is.\n\nDrawing on the sadly little known ideas of the Austrian School, our government shall embark on a vigorous implementation of monetarism. Circulation of the pound shall be subject to the strictest of controls, especially in regards to profligate government spending. Only when the private sector grows sufficiently shall we increase the circulation, for we know the dark alternative in front of us is no viable path. Cut it all down to a manageable level, from social programs to taxes, and our markets will stabilize to a perfect level. "
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_will_be_hard:0 "The Road Will Be Hard"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_will_be_hard_desc:0 "A sick child must take bitter medicine if they wish to be healthy again. Such a principle applies to economies, too. The disloyal politicians and slithering resistance has bellowed since Thatcher's rise that our reforms are too extreme, that we will ruin the lot of the working man and remove any sense of stability in the economy. Now, as unemployment rises and we plunge into recession, these illiterate fools claim that they have been vindicated. The only thing that truly has been proven, however, is that our opponents care not a hair about economic science.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a student of free-market principles, knows that such disruptions will come with the two-pronged approach of cuts and privatization. But such a situation will rectify itself, as a properly free market always does, and within a year we shall see the greatest period of growth in our history, a massive reduction in unemployment, an all-around boom of prosperity on the Isles. Let the traitors and communists cry foul; there will be no room for them once our entrepreneuring state cements itself on the world stage. We can not reverse course, for nothing worth doing is ever easy."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_u_turn:0 "A U-Turn"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_u_turn_desc:0 "Our reforms have been too bold, and we have found ourselves at the center of an arrogant drive to rapidly reshape society. The fluctuations of the market are proving too volatile for us to manage, and we must scale back our reforms before the entire country calls for our head.\n\nThis will hurt not just the future prosperity of Britain, but our entire base of support. Those who trusted us to create a booming entrepreneurial state have slowly receded as whispers increase about a return to a more sensible, moderate leader to strengthen the state. If we play this carefully and work to rectify our path as soon as possible, perhaps we can survive. Otherwise, the hope of a liberalized economy may die forever on the Isles."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_flat_taxes:0 "Flat Taxes"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_flat_taxes_desc:0 "How can we ever hope to build a freer, more prosperous England if government bureaucrats are always pickpocketing our workers? Furthermore, how can we ever hope to equally reward all labor if we believe that a hard-working, wealthy man should be taxed more than a lazy bum? The solution to these issues of taxation is to level it all off. We must tax each Englishman on more or less the same level, demonstrating that the hard work of success should be rewarded rather than punished."
ENG_ET_thatcher_indirect_taxation_act:0 "Indirect Taxation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_indirect_taxation_act_desc:0 "The very cornerstone of a free market, that of unimpeded rights to buy and sell goods, has been distorted for decades. "Sales tax," "value-added tax," "excise tax." These are all simply by-words for theft of an entrepreneur's rightful wealth. We say no to this tyrannical practice, and will prepare to pass the Indirect Taxation Act.\n\nThe ITA removes the many taxes placed on consumer goods, taxes that artificially inflate prices and stifle economic growth. Such a regressive measure hurts both worker and employer, and few could genuinely approve of such measures. Our economists already predict the booming of all economic measures once the ITA is passed, with our job-creators set to benefit the most. The only way one could oppose such a plan is the communistic desire to steal every last penny from our innovators in order to create a bloated web of social programs. To this, we can say that if a "social" program is built on theft from hard workers, it is more unjust than that which it seeks to remedy!"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_man_works:0 "Every Englishman Will Work"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_man_works_desc:0 "Sloth is the greatest sin a society can be struck with, for only without it can it truly value itself. This maxim must be taken seriously in the new England we are creating. Unemployment is largely the product of lacking personal ambition, and we must take whatever measures necessary to instill individual drive in all of our citizens. We need companies to aggressively find the unemployed and bring them into the fold, we need the government to stop intervening in private enterprise and start intervening in the affairs of the lethargic legions of unemployed. Find every man a job, do not cease until this society has eradicated slothfulness. Only then, when every man knows he must work, and work well, shall we begin working towards the booming entrepreneur's state."
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_woman_works:0 "Every Englishwoman will Work"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_woman_works_desc:0 "An economy is a project everyone must take part in if we as a nation want to see it reach great heights. When Margaret Thatcher was helping out her father's grocery, she saw firsthand the key role played by her mother in that businesses' success. Now, we unfortunately preside over a society where a woman participating in the economy is frowned upon due to amorphous social concerns. To that, we ask how we can ever be wealthy if half the population is not allowed to enter the realm of prosperity?\n\nIf a woman has the chance to work, the government must support our businesses in allowing her that chance. We are not suggesting anything so chaotic as employment for all women, for of course many have key roles in the home. But Thatcher knows firsthand the enterprising mind of women, and how much their drive to success should be nurtured in the building of national economic strength. Let's mobilize our resources to find work for all women who choose it, rather than regulating the few who have struggled to make it."
ENG_ET_thatcher_fair_employment_act:0 "Fair Employment Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_fair_employment_act_desc:0 "In an economy where the entrepreneur provides jobs, we must ensure that everyone can equally get those jobs. Enter the Fair Employment Act, which aims to prevent employer discrimination so that we can all prosper.\n\nThe FEA will ensure that every productive, upstanding member of society can share in its wealth. Employers may not discriminate based on sex, religion, nationality, or race, unless they have a just objection. The same applies to housing and schooling, both critical pieces of economic life. It goes without saying however, that this is not some liberal legislation that will allow for degeneracy in society. It would be absolutely criminal to require traitors, sexual deviants, and subversive races to be treated as normal Britons. Any slander about us allowing such people to have a place in society must be shut down immediately, to not equivocate the making a more equal economy with the infection of society."
ENG_ET_thatcher_final_push_success:0 "A Final Push to Success"
ENG_ET_thatcher_final_push_success_desc:0 "Already the average worker, free from the tyrannical tax-men and union bosses, is seeing more money in his pocket. Already our entrepreneurs are opening new and booming businesses at a dizzying rate. We are on the cusp of a prospering free-market state, but there still remain opponents in every corner.\n\nThe ranks of the Royal Party still crawl with opportunists awaiting a downturn, or even the slightest reversal of policy, so that they can stop our plans for the future. Meanwhile, Bolshevists and other dangerous types prowl the streets, looking for anyone to turn against free enterprise.

Afterall, wasn't Nazi Germany, the undisputed least free nation, a command economy?

FEN_NDL_pol_2_what_is_there_to_save_desc:0 "For 15 years, the collaborationist government twisted the English education system into something vile and unrecognizable. So many young Englishmen and women grow up being taught and believing in disgusting authoritarian ideals. Now, with the Royal Party gone and the rot exposed, many question whether the current system is at all salvageable. While the more patriotic lawmakers believe the current system and school administrations can be kept largely intact, it must still be decided what may stay and what must go."

FEN_NDL_pol_2_for_nation_or_family_desc:0 "As we repair and rebuild the once-twisted English education system, a central question continually emerges: what should children and adolescents be taught to love? Should they love their nation, that provides them with opportunity and security from war and disease? Or should they love their family, and the bonds that tie our nation together as a single people? The belief that one's nation comes before family appears to be a leftover from the collaborationist government, and many are asking exactly to what extent we should embrace a central tenet of Nazism. Regardless, it is best if this question is addressed sooner, rather than later."
FEN_NDL_pol_2_the_national_education_act:0 "The National Education Act"
FEN_NDL_pol_2_the_national_education_act_desc:0 "England has thousands of small, private schools with vastly different qualities of education from the standard set by public schools. This disparity, along with a substandard public school curriculum, has led to many young Englishmen and women to be undereducated. By nationalizing many sectors of the education system, and by setting down a much more thorough mandatory curriculum, we can vastly improve the quality of English schooling."

FEN_NDL_pol_2_an_england_rebuilt_desc:0 "England has almost recovered from the civil war. Most cities no longer have bombed-out husks of buildings, roads and public utilities are mostly in working order, and the lives of most Englishmen are returning to normal. However, there still remain scars from the war-- scars that shall not heal quite so easily. Like the unrepaired bullet holes on many buildings across the country, the nation's manpower is depleted, and it is unprepared and unwilling to fight any conflicts for the foreseeable future. This generation of England has finally tasted blood, and like their forefathers, they found it bitter."

FEN_NDL_pol_2_a_democratic_england_desc:0 "Never before in her history has England been so democratic, with the voting franchise extended to those from all walks of life, of all colors and creeds. It is through our continuing reforms that we have transformed our damp little island nation into a beacon of freedom and opportunity. We have done this after civil war, after invasion, after a totalitarian power crushed our spirit. England is free, in more ways than one."

They align with our politics and support our agendas as enthusiastically as they had before. It's clear that our first success can be explained not just by our being an alternative to socialism, or being the closest reminder to the politics of old, but also because the people believe in our political agenda.\n\nWith this mandate, we can make confident strides in our reforms.

In Victorian times workers would often lose limbs, if not their lives, to dangerous machines as they worked long and brutal hours. In truth, not nearly enough has changed since then. The collaborators cared little for the safety of the English worker as long as the goods flowed. The worker must be protected. New regulations will be enacted to protect their safety on the job, and safety inspectors will be hired and empowered to ensure these regulations are followed.

But after the destruction of the British Empire, twenty years of collaboration with Germany and the Civil War, few can agree on what the modern English family even is. People like Enoch Powell call for a return to the traditional family unit of the working husband and homemaker wife. With many women having provided support for the resistance, and even seeing combat in socialist militias, returning to such a tradition seems unlikely and for many Englishmen and women. At the same time, we aren't the SLP. Traditions must be preserved, but they also need to adapt to our new world."

The Sexual Offenses Act will do away with those by decrmiminalizing homosexual acts between two consenting adults.\n\nAlthough the Act does not condone such behavior, Powell's traditionalists - if not, strangely, the man himself - will want our heads for proposing it in the first place.

The blood we all shed to birth a free England forged a bond stronger than brothers. That much, at least, we recognize.\n\nThe same cannot be said of the far right. While most of them are either dead, in prison or in exile, some stray elements remain unnoticed among the masses.\n\nFor England to remain free, the organizations they have since formed must be rooted out and dealt with."

Thanks to the efforts of thousands of brave Englishmen loyal to Queen and Country, we have prevailed over our misguided kin, and restored democracy and the legitimate monarch upon our blessed throne. Now, however, new challenges arise, and we'll need a powerful, reformed military to face this brave new world with any hope of remaining afloat...\n\nDecades of stagnation and economic downfall have left our armed forces underfunded, undertrained and underequipped. While our loyal militias have proven their bravery time and again, we will need a professional military. The Ministry of Defence shall undertake decisive reforms to ensure all the branches of the Royal Armed Forces are returned to their former glory!"
FEN_NDL_the_royal_navy_desc:0 "For more than three centuries, the Royal Navy had been our greatest military asset, and the main instrument for British supremacy over one fourth of the world. Hundreds of ships of the most modern designs used to sail across seas and oceans, protecting our colonies and reminding all of our majesty. Even more importantly, our fleet protected the Home Islands themselves from any would-be invaders.\n\nWhen London fell to the Germans, dozens of ships were sunk by enemy bombers or in desperate actions, and many others were seized by either the victorious foe or our own dominions when they declared their independence. What we have now is nothing but a mockery of our old glory, left to rot by corruption and inefficiency.\n\nThe time has come for a comprehensive reform. We shall rebuild the Royal Navy, larger and more powerful than before! We shall rule the waves once again!"
FEN_NDL_listen_to_the_experts_desc:0 "The old Royal Navy was centered around battleships. This proved to be a disaster against the Japanese and German fleets: the former launched hundreds of strikes from their large carriers, sinking most of our ships without even firing a shot from their own dreadnoughts, while the latter relied on their submarines to cripple our economy.\n\nIt is evident that the age of the battleship is over. Our American allies are ready to provide us with their best experts in naval aviation, and help us in developing new naval tactics centered around carriers. It will take time to adapt, as most of our naval staff has never commanded anything resembling a modern fleet, but the results will be worth the effort."
FEN_NDL_carrier_development_desc:0 "The American experts have arrived, and with them are dozens of naval engineers with great experience in designing ships. \n\nWhile we rebuild our naval industry, we can set up a joint naval design board so that our own shipbuilders can learn from their expertise. When they are ready, we'll be able to develop our own carrier designs. Forever renouncing the mighty battleship will be a hit to our national pride, but we already lost a war due to "pride", and we won't lose another one for the same bloody reason!"
FEN_NDL_new_carrier_planes_desc:0 "With our carrier designs ready, and the first hulls laid in our drydocks, we'll need a suitable complement of specialised aircraft to take off from these floating airfields. Carrier planes follow different rules compared to their land-based equivalents, and our designers must take all differences into account to ensure peak efficiency and battle performance: to this end, we shall form a designing board tasked with this very specific assignment.\n\nWhile we are in no hurry, as the first carriers won't be ready before at least two years, it would be wise to begin this project immediately, so that we may fill the technological gap separating England from the other naval powers that already have extensive experience in operating carriers and carrier-centered task forces."
FEN_NDL_investing_in_submarines_desc:0 "One of our greatest mistakes in the last war was underestimating the power of submarines. By the end of the conflict, thousands of convoys populated the abyss. No matter how many subs we sunk, more would take their place.\n\nWhile many old admirals condemn such a dishonorable way of fighting, we can no longer deny its efficacy. To this end, we shall study submarine designs and devise our own underwater menace: silent and deadly, this new addition to the Royal Navy will relentlessly stalk our foes until they lie in the cold embrace of the sea!"
FEN_NDL_american_models_desc:0 "Our American friends have a large and modern submarine force. Rather than wasting months, if not years, we could save ourselves the trouble and buy their designs. This will strengthen our mutual friendship, but will come at a hefty cost. The American Navy won't give up their most advanced weapons for pennies.\n\nOn the other hand, we could invest that money in newer dockyard facilities, increasing our shipbuilding capacity. It will take more time to get up to par, and our first submarines will surely be inferior to their counterparts in other parts of the world, but sometimes number is a force in itself."
FEN_NDL_a_functioning_navy_desc:0 "Finally, the bulk of our work is done! While it will take many more years, or even decades, before we can compare ourselves to the great Royal Navy of old, our naval staff agrees that we have made a significant step in the right direction.\n\nOur fleet has been reformed following the most modern doctrines, and already dozens of new, state-of-the-art ships protect our coast from foreign threats. We have come a long way, and the results are showing!"
FEN_NDL_like_father_like_son_desc:0 "The Prime Minister's father, Earl Jellicoe, was a hero of the Great War. He commanded the British fleet at the Battle of Jutland, where the Kaiserliche Marine was decimated and our supremacy over the North Sea secured. There, our mighty battleships and dreadnoughts pummeled their German counterparts into oblivion thanks to the power of large-caliber guns!\n\nOur leader knows that the Royal Navy became what it was thanks to its mastery of direct engagements and clever positioning, and the new fleet shall follow in the footsteps set by Admiral Jellicoe. As an added value, the sight of new, mighty battleships once again bearing the Union Jack will do wonders for propaganda..."
FEN_NDL_restoring_naval_titles_and_medals_desc:0 "In order to truly recover from the disaster that struck our beloved navy twenty years ago, we need to recover our past honor. So many brave sailors perished under the waves then, and so many others fought with determination against the German collaborators during our liberation: their names, as well as the legacy of the old Royal Navy, cannot - and will not - be forgotten.\n\nIn order to reward the loyalty and selfless sacrifice of our brave seamen, we shall restore the naval titles and medals awarded to our greatest heroes before the occupation of our homeland. The advancement of technology and doctrine is important, but what is a fleet without a soul? The Royal Navy is the greatest to have ever sailed across the seas, and we shall honor the timeless traditions followed by our ancestors: their example shall lead us to new great deeds!"
FEN_NDL_a_need_for_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships are still the undisputed Queens of the endless waters, and the true patriots among us know this well! The Royal Navy boasted the largest concentration of dreadnoughts in the entire world, and it was only due to us being left alone in our fight against both the Germans and the Japanese that we lost the seas: with our newfound freedom, we shall restore our former glory!\n\nFunds will be allocated to develop more modern battleships, equipped with state-of-the-art anti-aircraft batteries in order to fend off carrier-heavy fleets...\n\nThere are some within the naval command who complain that with the money spent into a single battleship we can commission an entire task force of a carrier and several screens, which - they claim - is more powerful and effective. Their claims are flawed, of course, and the Royal Navy will be back from its ashes like the Egyptian Phoenix!"
FEN_NDL_steel_from_america_desc:0 "In order to build a new battleship fleet, we need steel. Lots, and LOTS of steel. Britain once boasted the largest metallurgic industry in the world - a result of the industrial revolution and our colonial empire - but twenty years of occupation and exploitation by the Germans have reduced much of our industry to ashes, and the civil war finished the job.\n\nThanks to our overseas allies, however, we can make up for some of the damage. American industrial conglomerates have offered to invest into new steel production facilities near our most prominent naval dockyards, probably sensing the chance to earn large revenues from our military tenders: new, state-of-the art blast furnaces will be built with American money, and will provide a much-needed boost to our steel production."
FEN_NDL_for_you_father_desc:0 "Last week, Prime Minister Jellicoe visited his father's grave, as is his tradition every year. This time, however, he returned... different. His face showed a new determination, a purpose that many had seen during the civil war as he directed the foreign support for our cause.\n\nWe do not yet know what he has in mind, but it will surely be greatly beneficial to the United kingdom as a whole! We'll just have to wait and see..."
FEN_NDL_unveil_HMS_jellicoe_desc:0 "Today is a momentous day for the United Kingdom and the restored Royal Navy. After more than a year of tireless work in our most advanced drydocks, the HMS Jellicoe is ready to be launched: the Queen herself will bless the ship, and the event will be broadcasted nationwide, perhaps even worldwide!\n\nThis marvel of modern engineering will rival the greatest ships built in history, surpassing the Bismarck and even capable of challenging the Yamato! The HMS Jellicoe will serve as our new flagship from today onwards, until the day Jupiter himself strikes its hull with the might of his thunder!\n\nRule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!\nBritons never, never, never shall be slaves!"
FEN_NDL_the_royal_army_desc:0 "The Royal Army once counted millions under its service, its forces hailing from all parts of our far-reaching empire, from the Scottish Black Guard to the Indian Sepoys. Today, nothing remains but fading memories. Despite the bravery of our troops during the civil war, we can't deny that most of our current forces are made up of untrained militias.\n\nIf we are to defend ourselves and our newfound freedom from those who would seek to steal it once again, we need to reform our armed forces, and decide on a new course for our doctrine. A debate has already started in the General Staff, and we can only wait and see how it develops..."
FEN_NDL_the_issue_of_conscription_desc:0 "When we fought against the collaborators, we needed every able-bodied man to fight for freedom. As such, we had to enact conscription, and thousands of brave young Englishmen died in the name of the legitimate Queen: we shall never forget their sacrifice!\n\nWith peace returned to the country, and reconstruction underway, many within the civilian government ask for conscription to be lifted, and for our army to return a purely volunteer force. A conscripted force - they say - will be far less effective than a professional one, and much more costly.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some in the High Command arguing for conscription to remain. Our enemies - especially the Reich - are still very much alive, and having a large army would surely act as a deterrent.\n\nAs the legitimate Queen's government, it falls upon us to address the matter."
FEN_NDL_hunting_with_claude_desc:0 "Despite his retirement, Claude Auchinleck is still an influential figure in English politics, and his wisdom is appreciated, even by his rivals. Our Prime Minister is especially fond of his mentor, and the two have forged a friendship through years of underground resistance and a civil war.\n\nHoping to relax for a bit from the hardships of his official duties, George shall go on a hunting trip with Claude, where they'll be able to let go of their strict discipline and official roles for a couple days. Who knows, perhaps the old general will let a couple pearls of wisdom slip from his net..."
FEN_NDL_the_front_of_the_shield_desc:0 "Auchinleck is right. Our army should focus on protecting our shores from enemy attacks rather than risking everything in overseas adventures: to protect the United Kingdom, we need a large defensive force capable of rapid mobilization.\n\nOur General Staff is fully in support of what they call "a sound strategy" to protect our homeland. Perhaps our forces won't be as highly trained as the American Marines or the German Panzergrenadiers, but they'll make up for it with their numbers and their dedication!"
FEN_NDL_lessons_from_the_invasion_desc:0 "The German conquest of Great Britain was the single greatest defeat in our history. We have spent years analyzing the causes of this disaster, and our staff agrees that the main reason has been our over-reliance on the Royal Navy: when the fleet was lost, the Germans landed a stone's throw from London, and the Home Guard was too slow to react. \n\nWe won't make the same mistake twice. Should any enemy come to our shores, they'll find that the entirety of the British people is ready to fight tooth and nail for every bloody inch of our country, until the end!"
FEN_NDL_a_defense_force_desc:0 "As Machiavelli once said, "Wars begin when you will, but do not end when you please."\n\nWars of aggression have always backfired against those who wage it, and our country has already been ravaged by an enemy invasion. In order to protect our nation from any would-be conqueror, we shall focus our efforts solely on protecting our sacred soil: our troops will be drilled in defensive tactics, and fortifications will protect our coasts and cities from all those who would dare attack us.\n\nNot only that, but we'll also foster a strong sense of duty in our soldiers. From the highest officer to the lowest militiaman, all will know how important their sacrifice is, and how many will be saved by their bravery: we have already lost too much, we shall never let it happen again!"
FEN_NDL_meeting_with_stirling_desc:0 "Among the many officers of the reformed General Staff, David Stirling - remembered as the founder of the short-lived Special Air Service - has rather... peculiar views on the future of the Royal Army. He spent years reflecting on our defeat in the war, and he has come to a rather surprising conclusion: our army failed to defeat the Germans not because it wasn't big enough, but because it was too large. Poor coordination, lack of training and subpar logistics were the result of an excessive reliance on conscription, and weighed heavily on our performance in the conflict.\n\nTo address this issue, he proposes radical reforms. The new Royal Army should - according to Stirling - focus on small, highly trained strike teams, each unit an expert in a single aspect of warfare: he claims with specialized support and state-of-the-art equipment, these units can inflict much more damage to the enemy than average soldiers, at a fraction of the cost. While such ideas seem to clash with the majority of the General Staff, it would be wise to meet Stirling anyway."
FEN_NDL_the_edge_of_the_sword_desc:0 "In the end, Stirling is right. Rebuilding our army to be like what it was during the last war would be akin to recreating all the conditions that brought to our defeat. Stirling's reforms are exactly what we need to show the world that we can return to the forefront of innovation even in military matters.\n\nOur new army will be much smaller than before, and centered around small, well-equipped, highly-trained and autonomous units, tailored to a single task. These small units will move fast and strike hard, destroying our enemies before they even have the chance to react. In theory, this should allow our army to deal crippling blows to the foe; in practice... we'll simply have to wait and see how it goes."
FEN_NDL_lessons_from_the_SAS_desc:0 "The Special Air Service was Stirling's own creation during the last war. Despite our defeat, they nonetheless proved themselves to be an extremely effective strike force: in several successful operations, they inflicted heavy losses upon the enemy at a fraction of their cost in human lives and equipment.\n\nOur new army will apply the lessons of the SAS - speed, surprise, organization and powerful offensives - at a general level, effectively transforming the entire Royal Army into teams of commandos! We'll strike at the enemy from a hundred different points, and destroy them before they can even hear the sound of their death..."
FEN_NDL_an_elite_force_desc:0 "It took us months to fully reshape the Royal Army according to Stirling's vision, but it is finally done. Our new land army is an extremely professional and effective force.\n\nThanks to complete integration between the various branches of the Royal Armed Forces, our troops will strike with the strength of a hundred men each, moving at lightning speed and destroying their target with precision.\n\nOf course, we have to be careful. As all small tools, this new army is delicate, and it requires extreme coordination and competence in order to be able to operate at full efficiency. We are confident that our officers are up to the task."
FEN_NDL_the_royal_air_force_desc:0 "Once the undisputed ruler of the skies, the Royal Air Force is but a shadow of its former glory. The harsh conditions imposed by the peace treaty, and twenty years of neglect and economic downturn have transformed our air force into a comatose patient.\n\nEven now, all we have is some old birds left by the collaborators, and whatever our friends in Canada and the United States could spare for us. If we are to re-establish a fully-functional air force, we'll have to rebuild everything from scratch."
FEN_NDL_jets_are_the_future_desc:0 "Jet airplanes are the future of air combat. Far faster than any prop plane, they can climb higher than anything in the sky. During the occupation, the Royal Air Force was barred from having anything resembling the newest German models, which means we'll have to start from the basics.\n\nWe should immediately establish a research group to analyze jet engine designs, and then teach our best engineers how to build and maintain them. It will be difficult, and we'll need the help of our allies, but there is much to gain!"
FEN_NDL_american_models_jets_desc:0 "With our lack knowledge on jet airplanes, we have no idea of what kind of airframe would best suit such a powerful engine. With the looming risk of producing flying caskets for our test pilots, we'll need to rely on our American allies once more to avoid unnecessary problems.\n\nBy buying some of their outdated designs and having our research team study them, we'll soon be able to fully understand the most important concepts of jet flight, and then apply it to our own domestically-produced airplanes."
FEN_NDL_improving_upon_the_engine_desc:0 "Now that we understand the basic functioning of a jet engine, and already have a small jet force, we can slowly start improving our designs. Modern advancements in the field allow our technicians to tweak engines and airframes to allow for greater speed without greater risks.\n\nOf course, we'll need help from our friends in the alliance to fully understand the scope of our research, but we'll make sweeping advances in a short time, allowing us to fill the gap between us and modern air combat!"
FEN_NDL_harris_was_right_desc:0 "Arthur Harris, also known as "Bomber Harris" by both friends and foes, was one of the most prominent officers of the Royal Air Force during the last war. A proponent of strategic bombing, he was convinced of the necessity to break the enemy's home front: factories, roads, ports, even civilian homes and schools were all legitimate targets to force the enemy to bend, or burn.\n\nIt's time we forge our own path in the air, and Bomber Harris is the man for this. Even though he couldn't put his theory into action due to our untimely defeat, this time we won't hesitate, and bury anyone daring to go to war against us under tons of explosives!"
FEN_NDL_invest_in_bomber_research_desc:0 "Bombers have changed since the last war. Rather than slow-moving fortresses bristling with machine guns, today's bombers are high-flying monsters with deadly cargo: napalm, phosphorous, even atomic payloads can utterly devastate entire cities in mere minutes.\n\nIt's imperative that we update our bomber fleet to the latest designs. Our enemies will tremble when they see our air fleet! Who knows, perhaps one day we'll see Germania burn..."
FEN_NDL_a_request_from_harris_desc:0 "Bomber Harris has come to us with a request. He needs a large amount of funds for a personal project, one that - he says - has been his constant focus ever since the end of the war.\n\nKnowing his preference for strategic bombers, there may be some value in listening to him. The General Staff will meet in the next days to examine his proposal, and decide whether to allocate the requested funds."
FEN_NDL_better_aerodynamics_desc:0 "The engine is the most important part in any airplane, but the airframe comes in a close second. An ill-designed airframe will break when put under stress, while a heavy one will only hinder performance.\n\nThanks to our allies' help, our engineering department is confident that they can greatly refine the airframes of our jets, improving aerodynamics and granting higher speed and agility."
FEN_NDL_a_professional_air_force_desc:0 "With our latest advancements in the fields of jet engines, aerodynamics and air doctrine, we can finally claim to have a fully-professional air force. Thanks to the help of our steadfast allies, our pilots enjoy the best training and the most modern equipment available.\n\nIt may take some time before we return to our old glory, but the day when the Royal Air Force can once again contest the skies of Europe grows ever closer. We'll one day dominate the skies as we used to rule the oceans!"
FEN_NDL_develop_better_engines_desc:0 "The General Staff has reviewed Harris's proposal, and found it extremely promising. He shall receive all the funding he needs, as long as he also focuses his attention on new, improved engines for our bombers.\n\nWith war assuming more and more a trans-continental value, it is of the utmost importance that our long-range aircraft are able to cross seas and oceans if necessary. Our enemies will fear us from Germania to Tokyo!"
FEN_NDL_a_british_air_force_desc:0 "While our erstwhile allies have offered to help us rebuild our air force, we don't need their help. We battled German Stukas in the skies of London before the Americans even thought about helping us, and we'll do so again if the need arises.\n\nWe can't expect others to save us, and for this reason, we can ultimately count only on ourselves. The Royal Air Force will be a shining example of British ingenuity and combat skill: if we fail, it will be our own fault, but if we succeed, it will be our triumph, and ours alone!"
FEN_NDL_secret_intelligence_service_desc:0 "No contradiction greater than Kim Philby can be found. Philby is a firm believer in the absolute annihilation of the enemies of the working class. He also leads the Secret Intelligence Service better than anyone else could. To remove him would be near-impossible and would be a major blow to the young Service. We must treat this affair delicately, like capturing a butterfly: we can neither tighten our grip too hard nor slacken up too much."
FEN_NDL_dealing_with_philby_desc:0 "After careful internal surveillance and intel gathering within MI6 from our most loyal elements, we have reached an impasse on a possible strategy, as nearly every option is a double edged sword. Remove him to assure loyal leadership, yet inevitably get a weaker leader facing a leftist revolt? Defang him by removing his guns and support, worsening efficiency and still provoking his ire? Or simply keep an eye on him, allowing him to run the Service as efficiently as possible...yet perhaps not allowing us to halt his influence until it's too late? We need to make a decision on how we will handle this matter."
FEN_NDL_mi6_is_for_the_queen_desc:0 "Philby, bereft of loyal men, will have no more influence than the average Communist philistine. By requiring an oath of absolute loyalty to the queen, we will be able to prevent leftists from joining our venerated service. Which one of them would truly be more interested in serving the queen than decapitating her?"
FEN_NDL_cutting_on_the_guns_desc:0 "The SIS has a formidable weapons stockpile, built up under Philby's orders but tolerated for its role in a global armaments network, and the operations we still need to carry out on our own soil. However, it is clear that the more militarized our Service is, the more dangerous Philby's leadership is. By slashing down this arsenal, there will be much less of a danger that we suddenly find ourselves dealing with rebellious red militias both at home and abroad. This may hurt effectiveness in the short term, but if one wants to shoot at enemies they really should be joining the Army."

When Tobruk and the Suez Canal were lost, she remained loyal. When Britain itself was invaded, she remained loyal. Through decades of oppression and hardship, she remained loyal.

Wales, with its rich coal and coastal resources, would be invaluable to reasserting our national strength. We also should not forget our nearly 1000-year-long history of unity with Wales. Their independence is a minor aberration, to be corrected with force, if necessary. In the meantime, our diplomatic channels will be buzzing with anticipation of a peaceful union."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_government_will_do_the_talking_desc:0 " Fortunately for us, the young Welsh nation, shuttled from crisis to crisis, found itself run by a stable and democratic government. Therefore, we look with much anticipation towards our upcoming unification talks.\n\nThe issue of setting up these talks will be key, with such a multitude of factors to consider. Arch-conservatives here in England will despise the appearance of concessions, while most of Wales, even their "moderates," do not wish to see their burgeoning cultural independence quashed. We must offend nobody and please practically everyone. God be with us."
FEN_NDL_IT_y_mabb_darogans_pride_desc:0 "The insane bastard, Julian Cayo-Evans, has been running our western neighbor for over a year now. In his youthful bouts of insanity, he truly believes little Wales can stand against the inevitable tides of unification. Down with him!\n\nWe shall immediately begin preparations for an invasion. We will crush any insolent pests skittering through the countryside, and within days our armored corps will be in Cardiff, to be greeted as liberators. Cayo has, no doubt, built a vicious and fanatical following, but they are hardly indicative of the average Welshman. A United Britain is closer than ever."
FEN_NDL_IT_welcome_home_desc:0 "The fraught road to reunification is over. Wales, standing for just two decades as an independent...well, perhaps power isn't the right word. They existed, for certain. But no longer. Now, as before the war, the great peoples of Wales and England are one. No more scheming nationalists and communists, no more volatile shocks from global coal prices.

For those who viciously attack our soldiers, there will of course be no mercy...unless they surrender. We must specifically track and kill the masterminds, finding their identities no matter the cost. All the while, our crack teams of journalists will be ensuring that our campaigns against the enemy will appear as benevolent as possible. Soon, there will be nobody left to even fathom Welsh resistance."

FEN_NDL_IT_the_light_in_the_north_desc:0 "We have successfully consolidated our power in England, and it is time to move onto greener pastures. One of the hurdles we must jump before unifying Britain is Scotland. Unlike our forefathers three hundred years ago, this Scotland has prepared for invasion since its inception. Since the end of the last great war, a rivalry has developed between us. Now that the Collaborators and their allies have been disposed of, we can talk again of unification."
FEN_NDL_IT_a_door_wide_open_desc:0 "After much consideration, Scotland has agreed to begin talks with us about reunification. However, Scottish nationalism is quite rooted in the country and it may take some dedication and elbow grease to install British nationalism and pride. There are a few hardliners in the government who are opposed to this idea entirely, especially the Scottish National Party, who ruled the country for most of its short recent history. Most, however, have agreed to talks - but it will take encouragement."
FEN_NDL_IT_a_door_slam_shut_desc:0 "It seems the Scots didn't take too kindly to the idea of reunification. Our diplomatic team was turned away in Edinburgh after making their intentions clear. While this seems like an opportunity taken from us, it is still possible to return Scotland to the fold. We have no choice now but invasion.

However we have placed small contingents of soldiers in Scottish cities and towns to ensure peace.

FEN_NDL_econ_rebuilding_an_economy_desc:0 "Homelessness, hunger, sickness. Such are the conditions left to hundreds of thousands of patriotic Englishmen after the violence of our civil war. Even the traditionally comfortable classes like business owners and landlords have seen their wealth dry up, leaving a gaping hole where an economy once existed. If we hope to stand on two feet, we must mobilize all resources possible to bring stability and comfort in the daily lives of all citizens, rich and poor."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_poor_desc:0 "London's ruins are a sorry sight: emaciated children, haggard families, rampant crime. And this is the center of our wealth! Imagine the situation in the rural villages. We cannot move forward with so many people, so many children, in dire economic straits. As of now, our most immediate goal is to provide the necessities to all those left in destitution. Three meals a day, clean water in a heated home, basic healthcare: these are our promises to all those crushed by the violence of the civil war."
FEN_NDL_econ_improving_social_programs_desc:0 "The legacy of the fascist collaborators is one of scraps to the poor. With the current state of our economy, we must immediately rectify this callousness. We will find the money, whatever the means: nationalize, tax, expropriate if absolutely necessary, all for uplifting the poor. We can't tread too hard on the individuals with some sums of wealth...but we can cut them down just a peg to feed the hungry and house the homeless. "
FEN_NDL_econ_cheaper_housing_desc:0 "As we have picked up our social programs, there has been some blowback from the private sector. Nowhere has this been more acute than the well-organized associations of landlords across England. They protest loudly about the "communist" proposal to create public housing. More productively, they have worked with some of our social-democratic and liberal colleagues to draft up a plan for cheaper housing. Via public-private partnerships, we can encourage these landlords to build thousands of new housing units with certain regulations imposed, keeping public housing to a marginal level."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_housing_act_desc:0 "Our new Housing Act, built in consultation with all parties affected from landlords to homeless, is a major step towards making housing affordable to everyone. By using some of our funds to subsidize housing development, setting caps on rent, and requiring certain standards to be met for all new projects, we will move much closer to giving everyone a roof over their heads. Perhaps one day, everyone can have not just a place to lay their head, but a place they proudly call home."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_jobless_desc:0 "As the English Civil War has drawn to a close, we are now free to focus on economic recovery as well as our political situation. So far, the data is dire. We must begin to reconnect with those who have been turned out by the war, and those who have lost their jobs amidst the ravages of the conflict. After we have assessed the status of our economy from an employment perspective, we can begin to propose programmes and special government action. This might involve some wrangling of party factions, but surely we can all come together to rebuild our country and get England working again."
FEN_NDL_econ_creating_more_jobs_in_the_north_desc:0 "Even before the Civil War, the northern parts of England struggled due to cuts in government funding and projects. No government member wanted to associate with such a rebellious region, and so employment and growth lagged behind the south. Heavy fighting did not improve the situation, and now infrastructure and housing are a significant problem. Now that the civil war is over and we face less pressure from Germany, we can begin to push more funding towards these left-behind areas and help them to, once more, become the industrial heart of England."
FEN_NDL_econ_deal_with_bosses_desc:0 "While we do not intend to give our country over to the interests of large capitalist institutions, their help is necessary in revitalizing our economy and ensuring that we can recover from the war. We can hand out vital projects (with ample government funding) for national recovery that will get big business on our side, the people happy and working, and the nation ready for the future. We will, of course, remain careful to avoid a descent into corporate cronyism, and there will be oversight of these projects to make sure that they are fulfilling our expectations."
FEN_NDL_econ_what_to_do_with_foreign_jobs_desc:0 "We still have an enormous trade dependence on the United States and the rest of the OFN, and some of our members have grown uncomfortable with the numbers of jobs being "shipped overseas" to these nations. Furthermore, there are many Americans here in England that many say are taking away jobs from hard-working English men and women. The more liberal elements of our party maintain that such trade is necessary, and that economic ties with the Americans further our national security interests. We must find a way to defuse tensions on both sides regarding this vital economic issue before the complaints boil over."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_trade_desc:0 "Our dependence on trade with the United States has been both a historical weakness and a vital artery. During the Second World War, our failure to defend this trade cost us dearly. During the English Civil War, it was one of few avenues we had to acquire food and manufactured goods from abroad. Now that the Germans no longer have control over who we can and cannot trade with, we must reopen this vital trade partnership. Surely, the Americans will be amenable to such a proposal...?"
FEN_NDL_econ_focusing_on_the_OFN_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations is our greatest ally. Just as they help us militarily, we can help them economically. We shall expand our trade operations in OFN member nations, especially the United States, and in doing so we shall improve our own economy. "
FEN_NDL_econ_expansion_into_free_europe_desc:0 "While Spain and France may not be the most democratic nations, they are somewhat free from the grip of the German Reich. Alongside these nations, we can also expand trade into Scandinavia and the Balkans. We can improve our economy and increase our influence in Europe at the same time."
FEN_NDL_econ_trade_agreements_with_italy_desc:0 "Italy's government is vastly different to ours, but that isn't important right now. Regardless of ideology, Italy hasn't had good relations with Germany for almost 2 decades now, making them a bulwark against German expansion. If we sign some trade agreements with the Italian Government, we may be able to sway them closer to our side."
FEN_NDL_econ_into_a_new_phase_desc:0 "Now that all of our immediate economic issues have been dealt with, we can move on to social matters. The social issues of the country must be addressed, from taxation to education. We owe the English people, whether they voted for us or not. For a better future. For a better England."
FEN_NDL_econ_a_new_social_plan_desc:0 "We are not the Royal Party, spineless elitists bending to the rich. Neither are we the Socialist Labour Party, forcing our reforms upon the people. We are the NDL, fair and just. We shall open the way for reforms to build a better England. Our new social plan will help to better all of England. The door is open to all, it is up to them to step through it."
FEN_NDL_econ_deals_and_business_desc:0 "The core of our economy is small businesses. By supporting these small businesses through subsidies and grants we can encourage the people to open up new enterprises. This will help increase employment and greatly expand the economy as a whole."
FEN_NDL_econ_economy_from_a_young_age_desc:0 "We cannot expect to ensure continued economic growth in the nation without a more economically-minded population. To this end, we will introduce more businesses and economics classes in school to raise the next generation to be more knowledgeable with regards to the economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_business_support_act_desc:0 "We shall attempt to pass a bill through Parliament for the betterment of England. The Business Support Act will allow us to give further aid and support to small businesses to reinforce the economy. It shall also allow us to send funds towards individuals who are attempting to start up businesses, encouraging entrepreneurial behaviour and benefiting the economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_fight_for_healthcare_desc:0 "Many in England believe that the fight for healthcare was lost forever almost two decades ago, when the Royal Party took power. We shall revive this idea and move towards a comprehensive healthcare plan. While it may not be perfect, this new system will be a step forward towards a greater society."
FEN_NDL_econ_better_pay_for_doctors_desc:0 "The battle for healthcare starts with the most important figures in the field: doctors. We cannot expect to bring healthcare to all if the supply of doctors is so limited. By increasing their pay we can encourage more individuals to pursue the field of medicine, allowing us to bring better quality healthcare to all."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_NHS_act_desc:0 "We shall now attempt to pass a new act through parliament: the National Healthcare Service Act. While this may not be a popular act to many in Parliament, with the Patriots denouncing the act as treasonous and with the Socialists decrying the act for not going far enough, the majority of the people of England will support us. It shall provide a more affordable and accessible service to those in the middle and lower classes, as is our goal."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_costs_of_education_desc:0 "If we are to provide affordable education to all members of society, we must first reduce the costs of education wherever we can. We shall start with the most wasteful aspects of education such as unnecessary and outdated textbooks and other equipment. With any luck, this, alongside education grants and subsidies, shall reduce the costs of schooling to much more affordable levels."
FEN_NDL_econ_more_equipment_for_teachers_desc:0 "With the costs of education successfully reduced, we must now increase the quality of said education. An obvious and glaring shortcoming in the education system is the lack of proper equipment that many teachers are facing. We shall have to rectify this mistake."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_education_costs_act_desc:0 "A new act shall be sent through to Parliament. The Education Costs Act seeks to, as the name makes clear, address the costs of education. While this may cost the government a large sum of money, in the long run, the move should pay off by improving the academic base of our nation and bringing England into a more intelligent future."
FEN_NDL_econ_fixing_the_tax_system_desc:0 "Calling the English tax system broken would be an understatement of magnificent proportions. The amount of unnecessary and unhelpful taxes levied upon the people is astounding, and has hamstrung the economy at a time when it needed as much help as it could get. We must reform the system so that we can properly strengthen and reinforce our economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_cutting_useless_taxes_desc:0 "Too much of our inherited taxation system does more harm than good. We even have taxes that cost more to keep track of than they are worth in revenue. We shall ease the people's tax burden by removing some of these taxes, but not so many that we effectively neuter the government. In doing so we shall not only increase consumer spending but we shall also increase support from the people."
FEN_NDL_econ_work_more_desc:0 "Calling the English tax system broken would be an understatement of magnificent proportions. The amount of unnecessary and unhelpful taxes levied upon the people is astounding and can only have helped to hamstring the economy in a time when it needed as much help as it could get. We must reform the system so that we can properly strengthen and reinforce the economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_and_what_about_the_rich_desc:0 "We must also decide what we are to do about income and wealth inequality, with regards to the richer members of society. The SLP would have us be rid of them completely, taxing their wealth to extortionate levels. The Royal Party would have us bow down to them, and give them free reign to exploit the poor and hoard their wealth. We will go for a more sensible middle route."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_groundwork_laid_desc:0 "We have done it. The impossible, Herculean task of successfully rebuilding the economy and reforming society. But we are not finished yet. There still remains much work to be done if we are to fulfill the promise of our ideals, but we can truthfully say that we have made England a better place."

Now our ministers must prepare themselves to run a left wing agenda, so radical and ambitious, it has neve been witnessed before in 10 Downing Street.\n\nWe have inherited an England devastated and divided by civil war; but we still hope that we may change England's fortunes for the better.

However, Harold Wilson knows all too well that this unity could disappear, and the party could collapse at any moment. Of course such a disaster must be avoided, and any and all solidarity in the party must be preserved.\n\nWilson will therefore make thanking the party the centrepiece of all his coming public engagements.

The loss of their party in the recent election and the fact that it has far more factions than our own, leaves it prone to far more divisions than we currently suffer.

This will let us make sure that their anti-democratic gang knows that their views are not shared with the rest of the party nor the English people.

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_convince_the_hardliners_desc:0 "Word has reached us that some members of the Hardliners seek to uphold democracy in spite of their leaders views on it. This is good news for the moderates among the party for two reasons. The first is that it means we may have more support than we first anticipated from this faction. The second is the fact the Hardliners are not all of one mind, thus enabling us to play on their divisions and keep them out of power.\n\nSome of the more ardent communist MPs will need more convincing, but there is still a chance that most will rather stand with democracy than with Birch."

Many of whom prefer to look back upon the ideals of Old Labour than embrace the more radical approach the rest of the party has advanced. Their numbers may be small but their support would be welcome.\n\nWe need all the votes we can get from our own party, a promise of restraint will help the social democrats lend theirs."

FEN_SLP_Pol_1_our_real_enemy_desc:0 "As Birch has continued to prove himself to be more of a threat than an asset to the party. Therefore we must continue our endeavours to find ways through which we can keep the party united.\n\nThe plan that has been drawn up to fulfil this is constant and consistent reinforcement of the Socialist Labour Parties belief that the real threat to Socialism, and England as well, are the Capitalists within the National Democratic League. There is no doubt that they would jump at any opportunity to tear down all that we will build to protect the workers of England."

Contrary to this, the hardliners would much rather they remained in exile, as they see their past as far too incompatible with the present reality.\n\nThen there is still the significant matter of what to do with the Queen, who has been the figurehead of a large part of Free England since before the start of the civil war."

FEN_SLP_Int_the_capitalists_to_the_west_desc:0 "We have freed the proletariat from their chains in England, but now that we have liberated the masses of one nation who is to say we cannot repeat this in all the territories of the fallen United Kingdom?\n\nFor its part Wales has never exactly been given an opportunity to flourish under socialism, and now that we lack distraction it is time for the Commonwealth to turn its attention to the matter of reunification. We will need to be cautious, to not offend those who remember the capitalist practice of cultural imperialism, yet it might be possible to reach an arrangement."
FEN_SLP_Int_sitting_down_with_them_desc:0 "Nobody likes war, the imperialist practice is sometimes useful for the working class but it also possesses a tendency to be abused in the name of the bourgeoisie and capitalism. Not to mention that it is normally the workers who suffer most in these circumstances, and it is not right for the Socialist Labour Party to harm those we seek to protect without it being absolutely necessary.\n\nAs such, we shall broach the topic of reunification with the Welsh government in a peaceable manner. It won't be perfect, and no doubt some concessions will need to be made but the situation is what it is."
FEN_SLP_Int_y_mabb_darogans_pride_desc:0 "The tyrannical chains of bourgeois despotic tyranny hang over Wales. A land which should be for the workers being turned into the playhouse of some insane pseudofascist demagogues and their corrupt flunkies.\n\nThere is a time for peace, but when the workers of Wales cry for help from just across the border is it not right and just that the Socialist Labour Party should come to their aid? Is it not our duty to protect all those victims of oppression? We march to war, may the people forgive us for it."
FEN_SLP_Int_welcome_home_desc:0 "Wales is at last once again part of the Commonwealth. This time not as a subject like the imperialists and capitalists would no doubt desire but instead as an equal partner in the new union we are creating.\n\nThis should be remembered for what it is, a liberation of men from the base problems of nationalism and chauvinism into the realms of a united pan national class struggle. One which the Socialist Labour Party shall take the lead in."
FEN_SLP_Int_on_terror_and_blackshirts_desc:0 "Unfortunately, not all can see the wisdom and benefits of reunification, some resistance was expected from the moment unification was a fact. Well, at least we know their identities and ideology. Fascism is a cancer on the world and it is no surprise that it puppets the skin of Welsh nationalism as a wolf would hide amidst a flock of sheep. These blackshirts fight from the hills, and we will need to deal with them if Wales is to ever know a proper peace."
FEN_SLP_Int_the_workers_of_wales_freed_desc:0 "In these troubling times it can be difficult to see what good we do for the people of Britain. But seeing the streets of Cardiff lined with those supporting reunification was a sight which made the whole business worth undertaking.\n\nThe workers of Wales, the coalminers and fishermen and farmers alike all turned out for the parades, they know as well as anyone else that we bring hope for their struggles. The proletariat of Wales uniting in common cause with that of England, oh it was a beautiful sight to see."
FEN_SLP_Int_the_light_in_the_north_desc:0 "To the north, Scotland stands alone, ready to defend itself from all comers. This is a bit of an issue for us. But, there are some signs that a peaceful reunification with us could happen."
FEN_SLP_Int_willing_to_negotiate_desc:0 "Our moves have yielded results! Scotland is willing to discuss peaceful unification. We must give them a tempting offer."
FEN_SLP_Int_the_capitalists_hold_out_desc:0 "Right-wingers and reactionaries have dashed our plans! We must explore alternative methods for getting Scotland back into a union."

FEN_SLP_Int_the_bagpipes_sing_no_more_desc:0 "Scotland is now a part of our nation proper. We must educate these new citizens about our way of life. And take care of any more nationalist resistance that we encounter."
FEN_SLP_Int_the_workers_of_britain_freed_desc:0 "From Land's End to the Highlands, in Edinburgh, London, Cardiff and many other cities, in the mines and farms of the countryside, Britain is now free. Free from poverty and strife. Free from reactionary extremists. And free of the worst elements of capitalism. Britain is now one, and it is a better union than the one which came before."

FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_armed_forces_desc:0 "With the Socialist Labor Party's victory in the election it now falls to us to rebuild England's armed forces. To ensure England never again falls to foreign powers. But the task before us is not just rebuilding it in terms of manpower and equipment, but in terms of its spirit as well. We are a Socialist Republic now and the military must reflect that. Our armed forces will not fight for such outdated ideas like 'King and Country', but to protect our socialist revolution and it's people. The lessons learned by our militias during the Civil War will help shape our new military,opening up the ranks to men and women alike, regardless of class or social standing. The new military will help keep the torch of the revolution alive."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_navy_desc:0 "The Royal Navy is dead, it's ships largely rusting beneath the waves or taken by the Germans. Leaving us the task of rebuilding an English navy from what little we have left. We must ensure the Hun never again reaches our sures. At the same time, the ideas the SLP can't be forgotten just because one is at sea. The new navy of the Socialist Republic must reflect the ideas it protects. Women will be allowed to serve on every ship, in every rank. Captains will now longer rule their ships like kings. The ranks will be given on merit and ability, not because of family name or money. The new navy must at once protect the people and be a symbol of the new England."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_navy_to_protect_the_coasts_desc:0 ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:Britons never will be slaves." as the old song goes. But our rule of the waves ended decades ago, and we spent too long as slaves. The days of a British navy that helps rule an empire that spans continents are gone. What the Worker's need from their new English Navy is a force that protects it from any invasion. That can react quickly and decisively to any threats that dares to approach our shores. Another Sealion must never happen. The Kriegsmarine will not humiliate us a second time. "
FEN_SLP_Military_the_ring_desc:0 "In the Second World War, the German bombing campaign proved a major factor in the UK's downfall, with German bombers crippling British industry and devastating morale, often leaving entire cities in near ruin. This cannot be allowed to happen again. England must be protected.\n\nThe Ring is an idea that has been on the drawing board since the days of the Resistance. The proposal calls for numerous anti-air defenses to be built all along our coasts, from the White Cliffs of Dover to the Scottish border. These fortifications will ensure that any enemy plane that enters our air space is met with a wall of Flak and Anti-Air Missiles. This combined with our new air force will ensure that the Luftwaffe never again threatens an English home or factory again."
FEN_SLP_Military_mines_of_the_explosive_kind_desc:0 "Britain's pride used to be its navy, but as things currently stand we are outclassed and outgunned. However, a bomb doesn't care if it's a top of the line warship that it destroys - it destroys it all the same. To protect our lands, we must litter the seas with mines. Improved and more efficient mine-laying operations and more explosive and destructive mines are the order of the day.\n\nIf we can't defend Britain with a fleet, we'll make damn well sure that no one else can invade us with one."
FEN_SLP_Military_improving_the_radars_desc:0 "A great part of defeating the enemy is knowing where they are and where they are going to be. Though the Germans were able to pierce through in the War, Radar was such an incredible boon for our forces that it enabled us to hold off their assault for far longer than we'd ever hoped, even if we ultimately failed.\n\nImproved Radar systems and stations all across the Isles will let us know far in advance whether or not an enemy intends to attack, and give us the appropriate time to mobilise an effective response. This time, we'll have them by the scruffs of their necks."
FEN_SLP_Military_deeper_and_more_silent_desc:0 "Our navy is not even a shade of what it used to be, but we have to ask ourselves - what good did it do us? Britain still lost the War to the German wolf-packs and superior naval tactics. As such, an expansive grand navy is surplus to requirements - what we need is to focus on submarine warfare. As assassins kill kings, so too do subs fell battleships and carriers. Britain's navy shall not be grand, but it shall be feared."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_new_generation_of_subs_desc:0 "In our ongoing efforts to emphasise submarine warfare, we've reached a barrier - the simple technical limitations of our current models. There's only so much that can be improved upon before the very nature of what we're improving on becomes the limiting factor. To overcome this, we must design and produce new, better generations of submarines - ones that can delve deeper, travel further, strike silently and slink away into the night with our enemies none the wiser."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_1943_desc:0 "By all accounts the German invasion in 1943 should have been impossible. Operation Sealion should have ended in miserable failure and the complete destruction of the Kriegsmarine. But it didn't. Instead it saw the Royal Navy defeated and the British Isles successfully invaded for the first time since William the Conqueror. Where did it all go wrong? We must examine those dark days closely, to learn what we can from them and ensure that such an invasion never again reaches our shores."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_fortifications_desc:0 "For nearly one thousand years before the War, no enemy force stepped foot on British soil. Our defeat in the war came in part from our belief that no force could. We were wrong. From Dover to Bristol, we must build expansive fortification networks along our coastlines, so that if an enemy lands on the Isle, their visit shall not be for very long, and will certainly not be a pleasant one."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_navy_to_protect_the_trade_desc:0 "The burden of the British public's agricultural demands have far outgrown the Isle's ability to sustain them. We've seen this before, in the War. Rationing, suffering, starvation on the Island; when German ships sank British convoys, the people went hungry, and eventually broke.\n\nWe may remake Britain into an impenetrable Fortress, but all you need to do to take a Fortress is to starve it out. We will not accept this. Our navy's top priority will be the securing of vital imports to our people. Never again shall a Briton starve in their own home."
FEN_SLP_Military_escorting_the_convoys_desc:0 "In order to ensure we never have to suffer shortages of the material kind nor any shortages of food and other supplies, we shall purchase and build more convoy seacraft. This shall allow us to increase in trade as well as giving us a backup supply of convoys in the event of an emergency."
FEN_SLP_Military_stronger_torpedoes_desc:0 "It was made very clear by German trade interdiction during the second world war that torpedoes are an exceptionally effective method of damaging and sinking ships. By developing more powerful and longer-ranged torpedoes we shall allow our smaller ships and submarines to punch well above their weight and sink the ships of any nation that dares threaten us.\n\nIt is not the size of the ship in the fight that matters, but the size of the torpedoes in the ship."
FEN_SLP_Military_improving_upon_the_armor_desc:0 "It has been said that "The best defence is a good offence". This is ridiculous as it is very clear to all in the naval military field that the best defence is six inches of solid steel! If our ships can last longer in the fight then they would be much more able to not only survive but also sink enemy ships and win battles. To this end, we shall research and outfit our ships with the latest and strongest armour available."
FEN_SLP_Military_better_carriers_desc:0 "Ever since the massive naval battles of the Pacific in the Second World War, it has been clear that the future of naval warfare belongs to the carrier. Floating airfields able to dispense dozens of aircraft to support in naval engagements, carriers are the pinnacle of naval design. If we are to survive in a hostile modern Europe we will need a modern navy to defend us. We shall build more and better aircraft carriers to maybe restore the great British Navy of old."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_naval_planes_desc:0 "A carrier without planes is simply a floating slab of metal, a liability, a waste of resources. We need naval aircraft to populate our carriers and our naval aircraft designs are severely out of date. We shall divert our efforts and resources towards a modern aircraft force for our carrier fleets.\n\nWe shall control the skies, and through them the seas."
FEN_SLP_Military_american_designs_desc:0 "It is a simple and unfortunate fact that our designs and designers are decades out of date, due in no small part to our loss in the Second World War and subsequent occupation. While we could attempt to develop our own designs it may be much more effective to licence American designs, not to mention faster. Should the Americans refuse we shall be back to where we started with the additional loss of our dignity."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_trade_secured_desc:0 "Now with our fleets modernised and fully equipped, the might of the new British Navy shall be feared and respected worldwide, just as it was in days of yore. As well as this, our new naval forces will be able to ensure that our trade is protected and secured. We shall never have to suffer under another naval blockade and our people shall not go hungry again. Once again we Britannia rules the waves.\n\nRule Britannia."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_army_desc:0 "With the war won, we need to look forward to improving our military using the lessons we learned during all that hard fighting. While our troops evidently performed admirably, there are significant improvements that we can make, particularly in heavy weaponry and organization. Let's create a bigger, better, and more professional army to protect the security of our new England. We shall forever defend our revolution, on our island!\n\nAnd, if possible, spread it further..."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_the_ECW_desc:0 "While we can create a fairly large army, it is likely that in future wars we will be somewhat outnumbered, as we were in the ECW. No amount of conscription or militia troops can change the fact that we are a small island against the whole of Europe. However, we adapted to this in the ECW by using strong, concentrated strike forces to break enemy lines and exploit weaknesses.\n\n We can use veteran troops as a shock division and use the SAS to complement them in disorganizing enemy units and breaking cohesion in their rear areas. This will mean that we may be outnumbered, but we will never be outgunned at the place and time we choose. Jerry may think himself a master of these tactics, but we will show him a thing or two about English doggedness and strength in adversity."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_issue_of_conscription_desc:0 "In both World Wars, conscription has been quite controversial, and it remains so even today. We are a small and industrious nation, and the more men we keep in the factories and off the front lines, the better. However, there are wolves at the door, and some of the hardliners are pressing hard that we need every pair of hands we can get to defend our revolution. Should we fold to them, the government may become more unpopular, but if we don't, who knows what future we have?\n\nIt is time to make a choice about what size our military really needs to be."
FEN_SLP_Military_keeping_the_militias_desc:0 "The militias were a critical part of our victory in the ECW- they provided much needed manpower to hold the line against attacks and could support our regular troops in their assaults. While they may not have the firepower or training of the proposed shock divisions, they are just as necessary to creating a functional army, and we would surely be fools to throw away what we have built during the civil war. We should keep the militias to ensure parity of numbers with larger nations that we may have to fight, and to provide a solid shield against further aggression towards our revolution."
FEN_SLP_Military_effective_strike_forces_desc:0 "The logical conclusion of our concentration policy is to make each division capable of supporting itself in these aggressive actions. Therefore, each division should be sufficiently equipped to make a local breakthrough in its sector. While this means a significant amount of equipment will have to be requisitioned, it will give us an aggressive spirit that cannot be matched, as each divisional commander knows that he can strike the enemy where he is weakest. The initiative will always be with us, and we can choose the field of battle as it suits our lads. Tally ho!"
FEN_SLP_Military_the_armed_union_debates_desc:0 "Unions are naturally a central part of our revolution, but arming them could radicalize the workers. Normally, this would be a perfectly good idea, and would afford the average worker a good deal of power, but the stability of the government (and, by extension, the army) is surely a better defence of the revolution than some armed laborers.\n\n However, our precarious international situation might mean that we need everyone who can bear arms to do so, should a crisis erupt. The more familiar the people are with arms now, the better they will be as real soldiers later."
FEN_SLP_Military_every_worker_a_soldier_desc:0 "No one can doubt the bravery of our militias, and they played a key role in beating back the reactionary forces that wanted to stop our revolution dead in its tracks. However, the most talented in the militia should probably be shuffled off towards the regular army, as they can benefit more from better training and equipment. Such integration will allow us to better defend ourselves, should the time come, by giving us a reliable reserve of experienced and talented troops to draw upon. We can then supplement the militia's ranks once more, and create an ironclad defence."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_tank_models_desc:0 "In order to really achieve a breakthrough, we will need tanks as well as experienced infantry. As of now, our tank arm is hopelessly outdated, and we must integrate new technologies and designs to make sure that our armored formations can meet and defeat every new threat they face on a modern battlefield, including newer anti-tank rockets, mines, and other tanks. Once we have the firepower to match, we can create a real modern army with great striking power."
FEN_SLP_Military_thunder_and_lightning_desc:0 "The next war will be thoroughly modern, and that means we need the firepower to match. Our artillery designs are too old and dated to be of much use on quickly moving battlefields, and so we must push forward new and innovative designs that will give our soldiers the edge in a tough fight. Combined with our new tactics and experienced troops, this will give us a winning formula when the next challenge comes."
FEN_SLP_Military_an_army_to_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "We have the tanks! We have the weapons! We have the soldiers! With the core of our army complete, we have a professional, battle-hardened army with the best equipment in Europe. Our safety, and the safety of our revolution, is now assured. When the time comes, they'll fight for the revolution, and they'll win!"
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_air_force_desc:0 "After the Second World War, our proud air force was entirely dismantled. To defend our island effectively, we need air superiority over English skies. Since we barely have a leg to stand on now, we can totally rebuild our air force from the ground up, while sticking to the principles that once made our air force the envy of the world. We will need new planes, new pilots, and new air ports, but a revitalized air force would be the backbone of our new armed forces."
FEN_SLP_Military_more_pilots_desc:0 "While planes are a rather important part of any air force, they are not the only things required. It is our pilots that will give us the advantage, even over a numerically superior opponent. We need to look at all the talent in England to pick the very best of the best, and this includes women as well as men. Once we have recruited, tested, and trained top-shelf pilots, only then can we develop the other infrastructure required to keep England safe from aerial attack."
FEN_SLP_Military_praising_the_Aces_desc:0 "Albert Ball, "Bob" Braham, "Johnnie" Johnson – these are the names people remember, true knights of the air that defended the skies of England and France in the heydays of the Empire. We need to emulate their fighting spirit in our new air force, as well as use our new combat leaders as recruiting tools to motivate potential pilots to sign up for their own shot at glory. With luck, we can establish the same esprit du corps that made our pilots legendary throughout the world as doughty fighters."
FEN_SLP_Military_airforce_american_designs_desc:0 "While we certainly have the flying and fighting spirit required to make a top-notch air force, our engineering department is a bit short-staffed at the moment. We will need time to catch up in that area, and time is something we just don't have enough of right now. We need top-of-the-line aircraft, immediately, and so we may want to turn to those with established industries. The Americans are already somewhat amicable towards us, and would always be willing to sell weapons to nations that Germany dislikes. Their first-rate planes, with our first-rate pilots, surely cannot be beat!"
FEN_SLP_Military_new_tactical_bombers_desc:0 "The innovative design of the Mosquito fighter-bomber was born of desperation, but was shockingly fast and agile for its role. In today's jet age, we may be able to take the same concept of a high-speed light bomber and create a multi-role aircraft that is quick on the attack and agile in defense. This would be able to defend the homeland by striking at invading forces while still being a threat across the channel to any hostile power."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_fighters_desc:0 "The elegant Spitfire was the backbone of our interceptor air defences during the Blitz, and would go on to serve many roles in the War. The sleek lines, high speed, and excellent maneuverability made it perfect against escorting fighters in a close-up fight. We will need a new generation of interceptors if we are to prevent England from being destroyed from the air, and this means relying on the same principles of old. Our new fighter designs will have to be the best of the best to protect England from any airborne menace."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_CAS_desc:0 "The Typhoon fighter-bomber was not so elegant as the Spitfire, nor as nimble as the Mosquito- but it got the job done. The raw firepower and reliability it possessed in a neat little airframe was perfect for its role, and should not be underestimated. These same principles of getting the job done with simplicity and practicality should be emulated in our new generation of fighter-bombers, to ensure that any invader gets a handful when they hit the beaches."
FEN_SLP_Military_rebuilding_the_airports_desc:0 "We certainly need pilots and planes to build an air force, but we need airports for them to fly from if they're to do anything useful. This means hangars, asphalt, concrete, fueling stations, and all the menagerie of maintenance required to keep airplanes up in the air. All this will take time and money, but we have to get it done quickly if we are to ensure that organization, refitting, and training can begin. Let's get paving!"
FEN_SLP_Military_more_AA_desc:0 "Our radar and anti-aircraft systems helped greatly during the Blitz, and modern air defense networks can render friendly skies an extremely uncomfortable place for enemy aircraft. Distributed and protected missile batteries with radar stations and spotters can attrit an enemy air force and provide invaluable information to our pilots in the sky, who can be directed to attack what remains in the most optimal fashion.

FEN_SLP_Econ_the_road_to_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the Socialist Labour Party recently elected, it has fallen on Prime Minister Wilson to bear the burden of sorting out the economic situation England finds herself in. Wilson was elected on a platform of widespread government intervention in the economy and more generally getting England back into shape, what with her economy hamstrung by the economic crisis of the 50's and the recent Civil War both.\n\nThis reconstruction will be a long process, but thanks to the combined support of both our wings and a steady plan to implement our reforms we are closer than ever to reaching the socialist ideal. What came before was a broken world, and upon its ashes we shall build a better one. A just one. A fair one."
FEN_SLP_Econ_financing_our_reforms_desc:0 "Unfortunately, England is not a socialist paradise just yet. To reach the goals we have set out for ourselves the Wilson Government will need to gather the necessary funds, something that cannot be covered by OFN aid and our existing industrial infrastructure alone. We need money, and our government has two options on how to get it.\n\nThe first and probably easiest choice is for England to focus on the basics, raw resources and their exports which are valuable no matter when or to whom you sell them. This would probably sit well with our allies in Washington. The other option at our disposal is to turn England into the capitalist world's chief manufacturer of consumer goods. A risky option, it also gives us the chance to make England more than a pawn for the rest of the world. Yet, a choice must be made."
FEN_SLP_Econ_focus_on_consumer_goods_desc:0 "Part of the reality that England must now face is the fact that we can no longer survive off of our former colonies resources. The Socialist Labour Party has thus turned to more traditional methods of acquiring income. The Americans it seems have an ever increasing market for finished goods, but they don't produce a great amount of some devices themselves due to the expense in making them over the Atlantic outweighing the profits. We don't have that problem.\n\nThe necessary living wage for an English labourer is low even if we increase it threefold, and importing materials en masse is hardly a chore. Thus the Wilson government proposes a plan under which England shall aim to become invaluable to the OFN not just through strategic position, but as their primary source of consumer goods."
FEN_SLP_Econ_factories_in_the_cities_desc:0 "The majority of the current English factories aren't located within the major metropolitan areas, and whilst this might make the cities nice and livable it also limits the number of people willing to work away from their homes. But we are not capitalists limited by bourgeois concerns such as the view over our cities. Our people need jobs and we will give them just that.\n\nLondon, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle can be expanded into first, after that we can aim for York, Hull and Liverpool. Eventually every city in England will have its own independent industrial base, which is good because the amount of interest in cheap English goods is already rising."
FEN_SLP_Econ_more_fuel_to_the_fire_desc:0 "No furnace will run without coal, and fortunately England has a rather large amount of it. Not quite so much as neighbouring Wales, but we can make do with what we have at the present time.\n\nOur government will ensure a direct route from the mines to the furnaces, we don't have many close buyers of coal in any case since the Germans are not what one might call friendly. The jobs from this endeavour will keep many a family fed, and what kind of socialists would we be if we deserted one of our major supporting groups during the Civil War. We have many friends amongst the union veterans, and it's time we gave them their due."
FEN_SLP_Econ_workers_in_the_factories_desc:0 "Factories need the people to work them, and neither money nor threats will fix that as the fascist collaborators all too often forgot. We of the Socialist Labour Party have a different, and dare we say, better solution.\n\n We'll simply pay the workers a wage worth his sweat. The marxist dislike of factories after all has traditionally stemmed from the fact that they exploit the workers efforts for more money than they contribute to the process in labour themselves. This will continue unfortunately as the capitalists will fight anything else, but the least we can do is give our workers a fair share of the profits. Throw in some excellent benefits and a factory position might not seem so bad a job for the youth of today."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_means_of_mass_production_desc:0 "Where once it was the job of the craftsman to create artisanal works, nowadays we use more refined and efficient methods to make the objects of men's desires. Machines, turning and grinding in vast clockwork formations which create England's salvation. Factories are more efficient than ever, and with rudimentary computing technology we can increase the efficiency to levels thought impossible once upon a time.\n\nThe benefits from this mass production will be used to increase the standard of living for all our people, for we'll not be limited just by what we make for others, we can make goods for ourselves as well."
FEN_SLP_Econ_export_to_the_OFN_desc:0 "America is like a furnace, into the maw of the great best goes resources and materials the likes of which ten thousand England's could never hope to consume, and out of the fires comes enough money to fund our reforms six times over. The rest of the OFN are interested in our proposals as well, not having to deal with a problem is an instinctive capitalist response, and if we build things cheaper is that not merely the hand of the market in action?\n\nThe facts of the matter are that now we have committed to our course we cannot falter. If we want to turn England into a paradise our children will enjoy, we must make some compromises here and now. Empty pockets won't fund schools or hospitals, but the American money will."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_workshop_of_the_freeworld_desc:0 "If something is made, chances are it was made by an Englishmen and it's three times cheaper than what the American is trying to sell you. The recent years have been good for English business and now we make what the rest of the world is growing ever hungrier for. Be it toys or machines or computers we design it, build it and improve upon it.\n\nThis has not been without sacrifice of course, it is backbreaking work and our people will need to be well compensated for any potential injuries incurred in the making of this economic miracle. But now that we have the needed funds, we can give them everything they earned and more. The Socialist Labour Party can move forward with our true reforms."
FEN_SLP_Econ_keeping_the_workers_fed_desc:0 "Hungry mouths make for precious little work, and unfortunately England has had to deal with the reality that we don't make quite enough to feed our current population. Importing food is expensive, and whilst we might never export it in great quantities again there is no reason why the Wilson Government cannot correct this fault, for the sake of the people, not for profit.\n\nFunds are as always an issue, but the Socialist Labour Party is broadly on board with two potential options. We can invest significantly in conventional agriculture, which might not be so profitable but it'd be a nice public relations boost and ingratiate us with the rural population. Or we could see about upgrading and expanding our fishing fleet, its not like the cod is ever going to run out after all."
FEN_SLP_Econ_fund_the_farms_desc:0 "The heart of the English spirit has long been the yeoman farmer, they who till the land and bring forth the spoils for the people to feast. But the industrial revolution led to the abolition of many commons and English agriculture has been on the decline since the reign of Queen Victoria.\n\nIf our government provides funds to expand the farms we have, we should be capable of producing enough food to keep the English people from being at risk of starving should a storm wrack the North Sea or the fisheries die. The grain, vegetables and meat from these farms can be put to other uses as well, school provided lunches perhaps could be a start."
FEN_SLP_Econ_subsidize_the_fisheries_desc:0 "Seafood was not traditionally a well integrated part of the English diet outside coastal towns and cities. Previous governments never really put in the efforts necessary to keep a truly massive fishing fleet running despite the potential benefits. This like many things changed with the German invasion.\n\nWith trade links severed England found herself lacking sufficient agriculture to produce food for all her people, and bereft of the trade lanes which had traditionally supplied preserved and canned goods. The Wilson government for its part does not aim to simply make do though. We will feed our people with the seas bounty, and increase our shipbuilding industry whilst we're at it. We just have to hope the people don't mind cod."
FEN_SLP_Econ_accelerate_mechanization_desc:0 "One of the downsides to being isolated from you empire as a whole and most of your major allies for near on three decades is the fact that you fall behind technologically somewhat. Doubly so when merely rebuilding what was bombed into smithereens is your primary problem.\n\nBut the Socialist Labour Party was not elected to sit around and let the market fix things, a programme to mechanise agriculture and fishing will go down well with the farmers who need every pence of their harvest, the Americans who we purchase the machinery from will doubtless also be pleased with their gains. This will be an expensive exercise to say the least, yet the long term gains from cheap food for our people should not be understated."
FEN_SLP_Econ_our_natural_wealth_desc:0 "England is a critically underutilised land, perhaps surprisingly so considering that for many decades we were the premier trade power of the planet. Gypsum, tungsten, tin, coal, iron, copper, limestone, salt, dolomite, clay and even sand are all things which England possesses in abundance and we exploit a surprisingly small amount of it.\n\nBut within these fancily named rocks and dirt lies the secret to the rejuvenation of the English economy. With some investment we can turn the English economy, at least temporarily into one revolving around the exportation of our raw resources. This will have an excellent profit margin and give us the funds we need to reform our nation into a more diverse, advanced and most importantly recovered economy."
FEN_SLP_Econ_expand_english_steel_desc:0 "The steel of English workers built the battleships which once set the whole world quaking to their knees. The steel of English workers forged wonders and terrors alike at the behest of their overlords in the upper classes. Now that very same steel is not in the hands of the bourgeoisie or the aristocracy, but in the workers hands. The peoples hands.\n\nThe Socialist Labour Party will need more steel than ever, but not to build wasteful exhibitions of our grandeur. No we shall build the things the people need. Houses and highways, hospitals and dams and railroads too and fro. We shall expand the steel mills threefold, we shall build the foundations of an industry which won't just sustain our people for now, but for centuries to come."
FEN_SLP_Econ_a_new_deal_for_coal_desc:0 "Black gold, that's what some of the more excitable capitalists once called the material which built the English Industrial Revolution. Coal miners made up a not inconsiderable part of our militias during the Civil War too, is it not right and just that we repay their aid in our day of need?\n\nLuckily for us, coal is still profitable for the capitalists. The OFN simply can't get enough of it. If we were to increase our production, perhaps even create some new mines to exploit untapped seams coal could well form the bedrock of our future economic plans. Unlike the capitalists of old however we will ensure that our people see the benefits from this, with reinvestments into the community and job opportunities given to diversify coal focused towns."
FEN_SLP_Econ_efficiency_through_socialism_desc:0 "The bosses of traditional mines and quarries were notoriously cruel men. Who got their quotas by forcing the workers to slave away in poor conditions with little safety for less pay. Perhaps this was somehow acceptable to the bourgeois who once ran this nation. Perhaps they thought if it was out of sight it was most assuredly out of mind. But we are the peoples representatives, their choice. We are different.\n\nBy giving the workers rights over their professions we return the control of labour to the people. By enforcing democracy we do away with the system of capitalism which crushed our forefathers under its wheels for centuries. Most of all, by removing the rich at the top of the chain, we unleash a peoples innovative spirit long suppressed."
FEN_SLP_Econ_imrpove_our_equipment_desc:0 "Unfortunately for our industrial ambitions we've run into a bit of a snag. Namely, our technology for producing and refining those resources is almost three decades out of date at this point. This is partly the result of our former bourgeoise overlords being notorious cheapskates, partially due to the fact that we were cut off from the Americans and the Germans never trusted the Royal Party as far as they could throw them, and mostly due to the fact that England was and still is a dirt poor nation.\n\nLuckily for us, the Americans are willing to foot the bill somewhat for replacing some of the more expensive and advanced pieces. They want our resources after all, no sense in getting them slowly."
FEN_SLP_Econ_enter_american_markets_desc:0 "America is locust, a great insect on the face of the world gnawing at the resources of a hundred different nations. Never satisfied and never full. Yet the great locust is ultimately a far better choice than the wasp of Germany lurking over the channel. Seeking to invade and parisitise us if they get even the smallest chance.\n\nWe will give the Americans the raw resources they so desire, we will give them all they want and more so that their money flows into our coffers to benefit our people. The workers of England will live a good life anew with the profits of their labours. The Americans in return will get the materials needed to fuel their ceaseless military-industrial complex. Both of us win really."
FEN_SLP_Econ_profits_from_trade_desc:0 "Trade has always been one of the more profitable endeavours for Englishmen, with records showing our island had links to the rest of the world from as early as the bronze age. But decades of bourgeoise neglect and skimming off the top have caused our earnings to plummet.\n\nYet with a new government new opportunities have been taken advantage of. The Americans, once ally turned foe turned ally again are more than happy to purchase vast quantities of ore and metals that our island is rich in. Soon with the money rolling in the Socialist Labour Party will be able to undertake the economic reforms we so desperately need to keep our nation whole. Our people have jobs, we have friends overseas, and all it cost was some dirt."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_five_giants_desc:0 "The Beveridge Report is a moderately sized document written during the course of the Second World War. Though buried by the Royal Party and their fascist colleagues in the aftermath of our defeat and the collapse of the British Empire, in the minds of the Labour members of the Left Resistance the report persevered.\n\nNow that the Socialist Labour Party is the one in power, we have a duty to uphold. We shall scourge from England the great evils of the world, our people will be free from disease, want for nothing, be enlightened, live in good housing and have every opportunity to benefit from their work. Everything before now has led up to this, we shall give the people the lives they always wished for and deserved. Regardless of what the reactionaries say."
FEN_SLP_Econ_want_desc:0 "England has had a limited social security for years now, but the Collaborationist government always declined to expand it to the people who needed it most, and so as always the Socialist Labour Party falls into the responsibility of fixing others' mistakes. Unemployment subsidies will give a great deal of aid to the more unfortunate members of our society, but we can additionally expand the social security system outright to cover a whole range of potential problems for the poorest members of our nation. Food stamps, grants of money to first time families, subsidies for community buildings and basic repairs. All things which our people cannot afford that we the government can give them. That we shall give them. Harold Wilson will not suffer England to be anything less than perfect in this."
FEN_SLP_Econ_equal_land_distribution_act_desc:0 "The two wings of our party have always squabbled somewhat, but there is something on which we are in full agreement. The bourgeoisie and the aristocracy own far too great a portion of the land area of England even now, and what did they do to earn this benefit? In the age of the industrial revolution it was the land owners who abolished the commons and seized all the property for themselves from small freeholding farmers.\n\nSo let us begin the Socialist Labour Party's most ambitious project yet. An act of parliament which will redistribute the agricultural land of england to the communities who work it. Miners and farmers and fishermen alike. Compensation will be given to the rich, but that is all."
FEN_SLP_Econ_disease_desc:0 "Our nation suffers, there is no great system of public hospitals or free treatments like some of the more enlightened places of the world, but that can be changed. National Insurance is a term used to refer to the programme wherein in return for an income tax the average person will have compensation for workplace related injuries or illnesses amongst other things. Greatly easing the burden of the ill and injured on their families.\n\nThe income tax won't be especially popular in some areas, yet it is the wealthy who shall shoulder most of the burden here and so it shouldn't impact our popularity by any great amount. Besides, they will receive the benefits of socialism too."
FEN_SLP_Econ_national_health_service_act_desc:0 "Healthcare has long been one of the main goals of the Socialist Labour Party, and now we are in a position where we can implement it. Why should the working man have to worry about needing to visit the doctors because they lack the money to pay? Why should women be forced to resort to midwives rather than hospital beds? Why must men and women pay for their children's vaccines, insulin and so on out of their own pockets?\n\nThey should not, and thanks to the National Health Service Act they will never have to again. This comprehensive piece of legislation will establish a nationwide healthcare system paid for by the state which will ensure no person ever need worry about necessary procedures, medicines and treatments for as long as our government is in power."
FEN_SLP_Econ_ignorance_desc:0 "Harold Wilson was an academic before circumstance forced him into the life of a revolutionary and leader, but remnants of the former economics lecturer remain in his policies still. The Socialist Labour Party is committed in its entirety to the ideal of a comprehensive and effective school system for the future students of England, to the end of promoting this the government will issue grants to a great number of school programmes and improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the great universities which shaped many of England's finest in past times will receive funding of their own to restore their glories. No longer will we look to the rest of the world for academic success, as in all things England shall forge her own."
FEN_SLP_Econ_equal_opprotunity_act_desc:0 "Schooling is not an easy burden for a family to bear. It is expensive, and when your child might not even get the proper use out of his schooling a seeming dead end for many families across England. Yet are we not the party of the people? Are we not socialists in the image of Marx, Atlee and Pollit? We should not let what has been convention define us in improving our nation. Indeed, Harold Wilson has crafted an act to ensure we need never worry about this problem again.\n\nThe Equal Opportunity Act will make all schooling and most higher education free for all Englishmen and women provided they get the results to enter. As we do this, we ought not think of the costs, but of the benefits to our nation and people from many young minds not being hindered by birth. This was a good act."
FEN_SLP_Econ_squalor_desc:0 "The bombs of Germany destroyed vast swathes of old English housing, swathes which have never been properly rebuilt if we are honest. London once home to a beautiful scenery now also shares its land with slums stretching as far as the eye can see. So too do many of our fellow cities and towns across England, and the civil war only made the situation even more dire.\n\nRegrettable though it may be, we must clear out these slums to build affordable housing for the English people, the first step of this will not be popular with anyone and most likely hated in London in particular, but it is necessary. Provided we stagger the clearances and buildings, we should even avoid a homelessness crisis."
FEN_SLP_Econ_peoples_housing_act_desc:0 "Now that the slums have been cleared, the Socialist Labour Party can begin our work on solving the matter of squalor for good. The People's Housing Act lays out the plan for the construction of a great series of government owned housing tenements and buildings across England for the purposes of affordable housing. Whilst not luxurious, they will be modern dwellings in which the English poor shall have opportunities to get themselves out of the cycle of poverty with our assistance.\n\nThe necessity of this act is great enough that both factions of our party agree in principle even. A sight few thought they would see without great prompting by the leadership."
FEN_SLP_Econ_idleness_desc:0 "For all that convservative reactionaries like to go on about how we socialists encourage people to be lazy with their lives and government support, they forget that the vast majority of people are quite willing to take any work offered when in a state of unemployment. Thus if we the government provide the steady and decently paying work, a large number of people will be suddenly in a position of becoming productive members of the economy once more.\n\nWe might have to nationalize a good many industries to achieve this, the companies are unlikely to cooperate of their own accord, but the results will most assuredly be worth it. Nationalization will additionally assist us in preventing the Americans from having a deathgrip on our economy, but that is mostly unrelated to our decision."
FEN_SLP_Econ_national_minimum_wage_act_desc:0 "Why is it that the average worker should have to subsist on a minimum wage barely updated since the days of the Royal Party? Are we not better than the fascists who betrayed England to the Germans? Harold Wilson certainly seems to think so, and he's tasked the Socialist Labour Party with drawing up new legislation on the subject of the minimum wage.\n\nWe'll have to raise it carefully and in a controlled manner of course, yet the benefits of the raise will still take some time to make themselves apparent. The long term effects of the National Minimum Wage Act will mean the average Englishman having more capital to contribute to the economy amongst other things, so even the reactionaries ought to be happy."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_health_and_needs_divison_desc:0 "We have in recent times done a great deal of legislation and policy making which focuses towards societal matters. Healthcare, wages, housing, education and so on. It might better serve the people of England to bring changes to these things under the banner of one governmental organisation.\n\nThe Health and Needs Division, HAND, will be at the forefront of implementing future governmental aid and support programmes of our welfare state. HAND will also act to advise the government on the potential effects of new changes and current policies, assisting us in maintaining a high state of living for the average Englishman regardless of his personal wealth."
FEN_SLP_Econ_signs_of_recovery_desc:0 "It seems to have worked. The efforts of years, decades of revolutionary activities are beginning to show once and for all the potential of socialism under the English model. When one looks across England they will not see the poverty and rubble of times past but instead a land finally beginning to recover from the ravages of war.\n\nHealthcare and education are free, jobs are plentiful and the minimum wage high. This is the dream of our forefathers, and with some luck it is something we can maintain into the future for all our children. Even the National Democratic League are starting to come around, so surprising as it may be, this England looks set to last the ages in prosperity."
