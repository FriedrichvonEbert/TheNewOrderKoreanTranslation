ENG_Scotland_unification.344.desc:0 "덤프리를 가로지르는 지평선에 어둠이 깔리기 시작했습니다. 황혼이 자줏빛으로 하늘을 수놓는 와중, 한 무리의 사람들이 다음 행보를 고민하고 있습니다. 그들은 스코틀랜드 점령에 맞서기 위해 창설된 수많은 스코틀랜드 저항조직 중 하나의 조직원이었습니다. 그러나 시간이 지나면서 그들이 참여한 싸움은 점차 승산 없는 무의미한 싸움이 되어갔습니다.\n\n잉글랜드는 저항군의 기동을 간파했습니다. 그들은 어떤 시도를 하든 간에 항상 효과적인 파괴력을 갖출 준비를 빠르게 마친 부대를 맞닥트렸습니다. 잉글랜드군은 그렇게 저항군의 동맹 조직을 썰어넘겼습니다. 그들은 이렇게 너무도 무거운 손실을 입었습니다. 저항군은 얼마나 많은 조직원을 잃었는지 알고 있었습니다. 그리고 계속해서 싸움을 멈추지 않는다면 더 많은 이들이 비슷한 운명을 겪게 될 것이라는 사실도 알고 있었습니다. 그들의 의심은 동기 부족에서 나오지 않았습니다. 심장 속에서는 여전히 열정이 불타고 있었지만, 무분별한 살육을 계속해서 이어나가야 하는 와중에 머리 속의 이성은 죽은지 오래였습니다.\n\n한명 한명씩 자신들의 저항이 오래 가지 못하리라는 점을 깨달았습니다. 그들은 무기를 내려놓고 남은 삶을 위해 은퇴해야 할 것입니다. 하지만 이런 결정은 누구에게도 지지받을 수 없었습니다.\n\n"이럴 수는 없어, 지금 꿈을 죽도록 내버려 둘 수는 없다고! 싸움이 끝나서는 안돼!" 한 명이 외쳤습니다. 그는 방금 일어선 남자를 바라보며 애원하는 듯한 눈빛으로 말했습니다.\n\n"명심할게." 남자는 피곤하다는 듯이 대답했습니다. 그렇게 첫 번째 이탈자가 발생했습니다."
ENG_Scotland_unification.3444.desc:0 "점령이 평화로운 합의의 결과든 전면적인 전쟁에서 나왔든 상관 없이 결과는 별 차이가 없었을 것처럼 보였습니다. 연합왕국이 무너진 이후 잉글랜드의 통제에서 벗어나 너무 오랫동안 번성했던 스코틀랜드 사람들은 새로 얻은 자유에 너무도 익숙해져 있었습니다. 그리고 새로 진주한 통치자들에게는 불행하게도, 스코틀랜드인들은 이런 변화를 두 팔 벌려 환영하지 않을 것입니다.\n\n대신에 잉글랜드인들은 폭동이 모든 주요 도시의 거리를 휩쓸면서 만연한 무법상태에 직면했습니다. 글래스고부터 에딘버러까지, 던디에서 에버딘까지 전부 일어섰습니다. 온갖 종류의 사람들이 자신들의 고통을 알리기 위해 거리로 나왔습니다. 국경에서 많이 떨어진 훨씬 남부에 위치한 정치인들까지도 스코틀랜드의 분노를 알아차렸습니다. 그들이 더 많은 관심을 기울이기 시작했지만, 폭력 사태는 점차 꺼져갔습니다. 월말이 가까워질 무렵 도시 지역에서 시민들의 소요는 끝났습니다.\n\n지금 폭동이 끝났기는 했지만, 불만은 여전히 남아있습니다. 국민들의 분노가 완전히 꺼지지는 않았지만 스코틀랜드 지역은 조금 안정화 되었습니다. 하지만 잉글랜드가 이 지역에 대한 지배력을 다시 한번 확실하게 손에 넣으면서, 스코틀랜드가 독립이라는 관념에 도달할 수 없게 되었다는 점은 부인할 수 없는 사실입니다."
ENG_Scotland_unification.34444.desc:0 "잉글랜드가 스코틀랜드를 점령하고 그레이트 브리튼 연합왕국을 선언한지 많은 시간이 흘렀습니다. 그 당시 스코틀랜드 시민 대부분은 외국인 침략자로 보이는 이들과 싸우고 폭동을 일으키고 항의하면서 매 순간 저항해 왔습니다. 하지만 시간이 흐르면서 저항 단체는 사라졌고 폭동은 협조로 변했습니다.\n\n결국 심지어 시위자들조차도 자신들의 목이 쉬어가면서 지지를 잃었다는 사실을 깨달았습니다.\n\n이제 거의 극소수의 완고한 민족주의자들만이 싸움을 계속하고 있으며, 이건 사실상 패배한 것과 다름 없습니다. 최선의 계획조차도 종종 틀어졌고 시간이 가면서 독립된 스코틀랜드라는 구상은 서서히 죽어버렸다는 점이 퍼져나갔습니다. 점점 더 많은 사람들이 새로운 정권 아래서 생활하는 것에 익숙해졌으며, 브리튼 섬 전체가 평화롭게 단결될 때 까지는 그다지 오래 걸리지 않을 것입니다."
ENG_Scotland_unification.344444.desc:0 "수십년전 독일 침략부터 최근의 잉글랜드 내전까지 재앙이 계속되면서 파괴가 브리튼 섬을 덮쳤습니다. 쓰라린 고통과 유혈 참사가 땅과 사람들의 깊은 곳까지 영향을 끼쳤습니다. 그리고 아직, 이 모든 고통을 이겨낸 스코틀랜드는 희망의 횃불로 살아남았고, 스코틀랜드의 민주주의와 자유는 과거에 브리튼이 대표해왔던 정치적 자유를 보존해 왔습니다. 비록 민주주의는 취약했고 자유는 계속해서 위험에 직면했지만 스코틀랜드는 자유로웠습니다.\n\n하지만 지금 시대가 바뀌었습니다. 좋든 나쁘든 상관 없이 잉글랜드가 브리튼 전역을 하나로 묶어 단 하나의 지휘권 아래에 통합시켰습니다. 하이랜드부터 시작해서 란즈엔드까지 모두의 삶은 과거에 비해 훨씬 덜 거칠어졌고 훨씬 안정적으로 변했습니다. 뒤이어 스코틀랜드가 개별적인 국가로 존재해야 할 이유를 찾지 못하는 사람들과 위대한 통일된 브리튼이라는 사상을 품은 이들이 점차 늘어났습니다.\n\n사람들은 스코틀랜드인으로 살지 못한다면 죽겠다는 주장에 더 이상 귀를 기울이지 않습니다. 그 대신에 하나로 통일된 영국 국민이라는 주장에 귀를 기울입니다."

POLITICS_ORDE_WINDGATE_COLLAB_DESC:0 " §w 출생:§! 1903년 2월 26일, 영령 인도제국 아그라 오우드 연합주\n\n§w군사 경력:§! 군인 가족에서 태어난 오드 찰스 윈게이트는 1923년 왕립 육군사관학교에서 졸업하면서 왕립 포병대에 장교로 임관했습니다. 1927년 수단 방위군으로 이동했고 거기서 아랍어를 배우고 사막 원정을 조직하면서 시간을 보냈습니다. 1933년 영국으로 돌아온 이후에는 기계화를 위한 왕립 포병대 재훈련을 담당했습니다. 1936년 정보장교로 팔레스타인에 파견된 그는 시오니즘의 원인을 재빨리 파악했습니다. 그는 아랍인 파괴공작원에 맞서는 대게릴라전 임무를 맡은 정찰대인 특수야간분대를 지휘했습니다. 그의 집단 처벌 정책이 상당히 많은 논란을 불러일으키기는 했지만, 그래도 그의 복무는 특별복무훈장을 받기 충분했습니다. 1939년 고위 사령부는 그가 유대인 가운데서 엄청난 인기를 유지했다는 점을 이유로 윈게이트가 시오니즘적 이상에 너무도 깊이 관여하고 있다고 의심하며 그를 소환했습니다. 2차 세계대전이 발발하자 아비시니아에서 이탈리아 전선 후방을 공격할 현지인 습격대를 조직하기 위해 또다시 중동으로 파견되었고, 이번에도 대단한 효과를 거뒀습니다. 나중에 그와 병사들의 처우 문제로 지휘관급 장교들과 커다란 갈등을 빚었는데, 이로 인해 우을증과 자살 기도까지 하기도 했습니다. 1942년 극동으로 이동한 그는 버마 정굴에서 작전을 수행하기 위한 장거리 침투부대를 훈련시키기 시작했고, 일본군이 상상조차 하지 못한 깊은 후방에서 공격을 감행했습니다. 이렇게 유명한 친디트 부대가 창설되었습니다. 친디트 부대원들은 적 영토 깊은 후방에 위치한 본부에서 작전을 지속하기 위해 공중 보급과 라디오 통신에 의존했습니다. 이들이 거둔 전술적 전략적 효용성을 의심하는 이들이 많이 있기는 했지만, 친디트 부대는 런던에서 높은 평가를 받았습니다. 궁극적으로 윈게이트는 수많은 부하들과 함께 포로로 잡혔고 일본 포로수용소에서 몇년간 수감생활을 했습니다. 결국 잉글랜드 왕국은 협상을 통해 그를 꺼내올 수 있었고 1955년부터 군 복무를 재개할 수 있었습니다.\n\n§w 중요 사항:§! 계속해서 다른 장교들이나 지휘관들과 충돌하는 윈게이트는 전투에서 승리하기 위해 소규모 특수부대 전술과 강력한 정신무장이 필요하다는 이론을 확고하게 지지하는 인물입니다."

ENG_tick_tack_tick_tack_desc:0 "불행하게도, 연합왕국의 항복은 반체제 인사들을 입다물게 만들기에는 충분하지 않았습니다. 비록 수년에 걸쳐 많은 음모 시도가 진압되었고 마침내 제 3차 케이블 스트리트 전투 이후 어두운 시기가 지나간 것 처럼 보였지만, 수년전 새로운 조직이 다시 이 그림자 전쟁을 시작했습니다. '여왕 폐하의 충성스러운 저항군'이라는 이 오만한 이름의 반정부단체는 좌익 파르티잔과도 스스럼없이 연대하며 현재 우리의 가장 큰 골칫거리로 부상했습니다.\n\n저항군에 의한 반정부 선전과 폭탄테러 빈도는 점점 증가하고 있고, 상황은 당국의 통제를 벗어나기 시작했습니다. 국왕 폐하께서는 곧 이 문제에 대한 연설을 시작하실 것이며, 바라건대 이것이 여론을 우리쪽으로 돌리는데 도움을 줄 것입니다."
ENG_the_prime_minister_speaks_desc:0 "잉글랜드는 타협의 산물로서, 독일인들이 우리를 네덜란드나 노르웨이처럼 꼭두각시로 만들 필요가 없다고 생각한 것에 전적으로 의존하고 있습니다. 따라서 영국 해협 너머 우리의 '후원자'와의 관계를 증진하거나 축소해야 한다는 일부 파벌의 성토와는 관계 없이, 우리의 최우선 목표는 잉글랜드의 지속적인 생존이 되어야 합니다.\n\n국왕 폐하께선 단지 수려한 몇몇 단어들로 이 긴장상태를 종식시킬 수 있다고 여기실지 모르겠지만, 우리는 아주 잘 알고 있습니다. 이런 일련의 위기들은 하나하나가 모두 잉글랜드의 생존에 대한 중대한 위협입니다. 그러니 우리는 이 기회를 빌어 저항군이 어떻게 떠들어대건 우리는 독일과 싸울 여력이 없다는 정부 입장을 다시금 지적해야 합니다."
ENG_anyone_anything_desc:0 "어떤 사람들은 전쟁을 종식시킨 평화협정에 서명한 정부에게 감사해야 한다고 여기는 반면, 잉글랜드가 아니라 연합왕국이었던 때를 추억하는 사람들은 다르게 생각합니다. 물론 정부의 시책을 비판하는 것이 경찰의 바람직한 태도는 아니지만, 어쩌면 수천명의 사람들에게 왕의 연설을 들려주는 것 보단 그저 모든것이 잘 돌아가고 있다고 발표하는 것이 더 안전한 방법이었을지도 모릅니다. \n\n국왕폐하께 지워지는 모든 부담은 차치하고, 일일 체포건수 자체가 폭등하고 있습니다. 케이블 스트리트의 봉쇄는 말할 것도 없고, 시위대의 절반을 유치하기에는 런던 경찰서들의 공간이 모자랄 정도입니다. 그러나 경찰은 명령에 복종하는 쪽이지, 판단을 내리는 쪽이 아닙니다. 다만 그 연설이 폭도들을 진정시키길 바랄 뿐입니다."
ENG_what_to_say_desc:0 "작금의 상황에서 왕이 해야할 일은 무엇인가? 에드워드 8세는 왕이 되기 위해 태어났지만 이런 상황에는 전혀 준비되어있지 않습니다. 동생 버티는 대화를 피하고 있고 조카딸을 지지하는 반역자들, 곧 백성의 절반이 나머지 반을 죽여버릴 만반의 준비를 하고 있는 시점에서 왕은 뭐라고 말해야 할까요? 그는 정부에 대해 정당한 불만을 가진 사람들을 어떻게 진정시켜야 할까요?\n\n이 문제에 있어서 수상 알렉산더는 아무런 도움이 되지 못합니다. 월리스는 상류층을 설득할 줄은 알지만 이 연설은 귀족들 뿐 아니라 모든 국민이 듣게 될 것입니다. 또한 혹여나 독일군이 그의 말을 잘못 이해한다면... 정말 짧은 시간 존속한 정부가 될 것은 자명합니다. 그러나 이 모든 불안 속에서도 한가지 확실한 것은, 그가 이 일을 싫어하더라도 이 일은 그의 것이라는 사실입니다."
ENG_whole_state_under_there_desc:0 "'여왕 폐하의 충성스러운 저항군'은 지난 20년 가까이 정부가 방기해온 모든 문제의 집합입니다. 현재 조직은 3개 파벌의 조합으로 가장 쉽게 설명될 수 있는데, 데이비드 스털링과 그의 특공대는 전쟁 후에도 항복하지 않은 잉글랜드에서 가장 큰 반체제 군부대입니다. 또한 빌 알렉산더와 좌파 저항세력은 제 3차 케이블 스트리트 전투에서 소멸된 CPGB만큼의 영향력은 없을지 몰라도 여전히 다양한 좌파 정당과 노동당의 지지를 받고 있습니다. 마지막으로 베일에 싸인 원래 저항군의 지도자가 있으며 그는 이데올로기적 간극에도 불구하고 잉글랜드의 거의 모든 반체제 집단의 호응을 얻어냈습니다. 그가 죽었는지 혹은 살았는지, 그의 정체는 무엇인지에 대해 의견이 분분하지만 우리 첩보대장은 그가 확실히 존재하고 심지어 살아있음에 의심할 여지가 없다고 말합니다. 이 조직은 우리의 골칫거리고, 반드시 제거되어야 합니다."
ENG_the_gears_are_moving_desc:0 "동작 기계에 대한 재미있는 사실은 감독자가 더이상 기계를 조작하지 않아도 기계 스스로 계속 움직인다는 점입니다. 모든 사람은 이 상태가 마치 저항군 같다는 점에 동의할테지만, 특히나 잉글랜드 괴뢰 정부는 이 조직이 운전자 없이 과속하는 자동차 같아서 연료가 다 떨어지거나 도로에서 벗어나 어딘가에 부딪힐 때 까지 목적없이 달리고 있다고 생각합니다. 또한 그들은 종종 반군을 그저 과거의 망령이나 하수구에서 옹송그리고 모여있는 얼간이들로 묘사하곤 합니다.\n\n그러나 저항군의 아들과 딸은 다른 비유를 선호합니다. 그들은 일단 활성화되면 조작자가 필요없는 기계입니다. 그들은 의무를 다하는 순간까지 홀로 남겨질 수 있는 시한폭탄이고, 마침내 국왕의 연설 시작까지 카운트다운에 들어갔습니다."
ENG_big_big_love_desc:0 "대부분의 저항군은 온건파이며 더 구체적인 무언가보다도 오직 자유를 갈망하는 사람들입니다. 그러나 데이비드 스털링과 빌 알렉산더는 다른 목표를 가지고 있습니다. 스털링은 복수를 갈망합니다. 그는 연합왕국의 마지막 군인으로서 결코 항복하지 않았고, 이 때문에 많은 동료들을 잃어야 했습니다. 알렉산더는 혁명을 원하지만 독일인들을 영원히 브리튼 섬 밖으로 몰아내기 위해 기꺼이 그의 이상을 내려놓았습니다. 그는 많은 동지들을 케이블 스트리트에서의 첫번째 폭동에서 잃어야 했지만, 그는 살아남았고 곧 피의 복수를 위한 자신의 차례를 얻을 것입니다. \n\n한편 오친렉은 배반자 왕의 연설이 저항군이 기획한 멋진 쇼가 되길 원합니다. 스털링과 알렉산더는 서로를 혐오할지도 모르지만, 그들은 다른 저항군 파벌을 모두 합친 것보다 더 숙련된 게릴라 전술 경험을 가지고 있습니다. 이제 그들이 그것을 활용할 시간이 왔습니다."
ENG_almost_there_desc:0 "왕의 연설은 상당히 중요한 행사로 급부상하고 있습니다. 누군가는 샴페인을 터뜨리고 축하하고 싶겠지만, 반면 런던은 이에 대비한 조치들로 사실상 고립되고 있습니다. 그러나 진정으로 모든 사람들의 입에 오르내리는 것은 과연 '왜'냐는 것입니다. 제 3 케이블 스트리트 사건은 수년 전의 일이고, 그 이후로 런던에서는 어떤 실제적인 소요사태도 존재하지 않았습니다. 이는 마치 정부가 무언가를 걱정하는 것처럼 보이게 합니다.\n\n언론계에서는 추측성 기사가 난무하고 연일 호외를 발간하고 있지만 사람들은 고작해야 이론적인 위협에 대해 런던 전체를 봉쇄하고 통행금지령을 내리는 것이 과연 적절한 조치인지에 대해 의구심을 품고 있습니다. 그러나 정부는 이 조치를 강행하기로 결정했습니다."
ENG_keeping_ahead_desc:0 "런던 경찰은 필요하다면 어떤 조치도 불사하겠다는 태도로 통행을 차단하고 시민들을 세심하게 감시하고 있습니다. 이미 군중소개와 비상시 억류 방침은 사전에 널리 전파되었고, 의심스러운 거수자는 주요 구역으로의 출입이 금지될 것이며 연설이 시작되기 며칠 전 불법 무기에 대한 불시검문 또한 있을 예정입니다.\n\n연설 당일, 국왕폐하께서는 일정을 마치신 후 평온하게 식사를 즐기실 것이고 어떠한 방해도 없이 안전하게 궁으로 돌아가실 것입니다. 반란군 놈들은 런던 경찰국을 이길 수 없습니다. 이제 그들 앞에 놓인 것은 오로지 시련뿐입니다."
ENG_writing_on_the_walls_desc:0 "런던이 얼마나 혁명에 적합한지 알기 위해선 런던 거리를 바라볼 필요가 있습니다. 각각의 건물은 마치 불을 지피기 위해 쌓아놓은 건초더미 같아서 불씨를 하나만 당겨도 금새 활활 타오를 것 같습니다. 경찰은 문제가 되지 않습니다. 그들은 '거래'를 통해 자리를 비울 것이고, 그것도 통하지 않는다면 우리측 사람들에 의해 처리될 것입니다.\n\n군중은 빌의 동무들이 해결할 것입니다. 국가 전체의 노동조합 중 절반을 손에 쥐고 있다면 그중 일부를 이런 행사에 유도하는 것쯤은 일도 아닙니다. 왕이 티타임을 가질 때 스털링 중령이 사복으로 위장한 대원들을 이끈다면 우리는 그와 이 나라가 영원히 잊을 수 없는 일을 해낼 수 있을 겁니다."
ENG_the_kings_speech_desc:0 "윈저 왕조의 에드워드 8세는 호감가는 인물은 아닐지 몰라도 잉글랜드의 왕입니다. '왕의 연설'은 정오에 시작해서 한시간 가량 계속되고 몇몇 유명 공직자들과 늦은 점심을 즐기며 마무리될 것입니다. \n\n물론 모든것이 계획대로 진행된다는 가정 하에 말입니다. 저항군과 정부 모두 무언가 일어날 것이라는 사실은 알고 있지만, 이 시점에서 정확히 어떤 일이 일어날지는 주님만이 알고 계십니다. 역사의 동전은 공중에서 회전하고 있으며, 떨어질 때 어떤 모습을 하고 있을지는 그것을 던진 사람들조차도 확신하지 못합니다. 저항군의 예상이 맞아떨어져서 준비된 불쏘시개에 불이 붙을까요? 혹은 정부가 잘 대비했을까요. 알 수 있는 방법은 오직..."

ENG_edwards_round_table_desc:0 "왕의 업무 중 하나는 정부가 위기에 처했을 때에도 서로 협력할 수 있도록 정치인들 간의 관계를 유지하는 것입니다. 알렉 더글라스흄은 전쟁 이후 가장 유능한 총리이며, 마가렛 대처는 신세대 정치인 중 가장 영향력 있는 인물이자 당 대변인입니다. 이 두 사람은 정책에 관한 어떤 논의에도 초대받을 가치가 있습니다. \n\n진짜 문제는 근왕당 이념의 극단에 서 있는 두 인물입니다. 아서 체스터턴은 노골적인 파시스트이자 친독파인 반면 해럴드 맥밀런은 가장 영향력있는 개혁주의자고, 불행히도 두 사람 모두 상대방과 협력하기를 거절할 것 같습니다. 우리는 한명을 선택해야 합니다."
ENG_chestertons_intensity_desc:0 "아서 체스터턴 내무부 장관은 원탁회의의 첫번째 참석자입니다. 비록 정부부처 일각에서 그의 독일에 대한 열정과 지지에 의문을 표하고 있지만, 국왕폐하께서는 의회에 체스터턴이 우리와 함께 일하게 되어 즐겁다고 단언하셨습니다. 그는 이미 질서확보를 위한 야간통행금지와 무장경찰의 확대를 추진하고 있습니다."
ENG_a_fist_and_will_desc:0 "체스터턴은 군대의 규모를 대폭 증강해야 안보를 확립하고 반란을 진압할 수 있다는 사실을 폐하께 상신했습니다. 병력이 징병될 것이며, 그들은 어떠한 저항도 격파해낼 수 있는 정부의 주먹으로서 저항군의 온상이라고 여겨지는 북부 지역에 배치될 것입니다. 비록 일부 장성들이 이러한 군비증강의 현실성에 대해 우려를 표하고 있고 실제로도 도시와 시골을 막론하고 반대가 만만치 않지만, 그는 자신이 이 사안에 있어 국왕폐하의 전폭적인 지지를 받고 있음을 확신하고 있습니다."
ENG_terror_tactics_desc:0 "아마도 군비증강만으로는 체스터턴 장관이 보기에 충분하지 않았나봅니다. 그는 국정회의에서 반군의 위협을 뿌리뽑기 위해 가능한 모든 수단을 동원할 것을 군에 요구했습니다. 그는 이 조치가 저항세력의 의지를 분쇄하고 그들을 본래 있어야 했던 시궁창으로 다시 내몰기 위해 필수적이라고 믿고 있습니다. 우리 장성 중 일부는 자국민을 상대로 한 어떠한 \"테러 전술\" 도 용납할 수 없다며, 이 조치가 전쟁기간 루프트바페의 런던 공습과 비견된다고 주장하기도 했지만 장관은 모든 회의 참석자들에게 반란군은 잉글랜드 국민이 아니라 죗값을 치러야 할 반역자들임을 상기시켰습니다."
ENG_towards_the_north_desc:0 "체스터턴은 HMMLR을 뿌리뽑기 위해 군대를 북쪽으로 보낸다는 결정을 내렸습니다. 북부는 항상 저항 활동의 온상이었고, 스코틀랜드와 가깝기 때문에 항상 붙잡을만 하면 놓치기 일쑤였습니다. 더 이상 이렇게 놔둘 수는 없습니다. 군대가 한방에 저항군을 격파할 것입니다."
ENG_use_the_blackshirts_desc:0 "검은 셔츠단은 모슬리가 창설했지만, 반역자가 도망친지 오랜 시간이 지난 지금은 우리를 위해 일하고 있습니다. 이 준군사조직은 흉포성과 파시즘 이상에 대한 헌신으로 널리 알려져 있습니다. 비록 정부 내 많은 인사들이 저들을 인종주의자이자 폭력적인 훌리건이라고 말하며 멀리하지만, 체스터턴은 저들이 아군을 강화시키고 저들의 절대적인 헌신이 저항세력을 위협해 굴복시킬 수 있다고 믿고 있습니다."
ENG_dominate_sheffield_desc:0 "셰필드는 전격전 동안 파괴되기는 했지만 간신히 재건되어 요크셔의 중요한 교통과 산업의 중심지가 되었습니다. 반란이 일어난다면 셰필드 기차역은 남부 기지에서 반란이 일어난 북부로 군대를 수송하는데 핵심적인 역할을 수행할 것입니다. 따라서 체스터턴은 요크셔에서 검은셔츠단 작전을 강화하고 셰필드에, 그 중에서도 특히 역 주변에 검문소를 설치하는 방안을 추진했습니다. 어떤 대가를 치르더라도 북부의 관문이 무너지도록 놔둬서는 안됩니다."
ENG_edwards_trip_to_germania_desc:0 "국왕이 독일로 향했고 파시스트 사상가 아서 체스터턴도 함께 따라갔습니다. 이번 방문을 둘러싼 소문에 의하면 저들이 혹시 잉글랜드군 규모에 걸린 제한을 약간 해제해 달라는 요청을 하는 동시에 더 큰 잉글랜드군을 무장하는데 도움을 줄 독일제 장비를 구매하기 위해 출발했을지도 모른다고 합니다.\n\n잉글랜드가 대독일국의 마지못해 복종한 부하가 아닌 듯한 행동을 보인 것은 올해 들어서 이번이 처음이며, 아마 독일 관료들의 강한 흥미를 불러일으켜서 우리에게 유리한 결과를 얻을 수 있을 지도 모릅니다."
ENG_homes_experience_desc:0 "폐하께서 이번 반란 문제를 해결하기 위해 앨랙 더글러스-흄 수상을 원탁으로 소환하셨습니다. 벌써 수상은 의회에서 이 불확실한 시기에 "통합과 질서"를 요청하는 연설을 했습니다. 폐하께서는 전후 최장 임기를 자랑하는 수상이 이번 위기를 헤쳐나갈 수 있도록 도움을 주기를 바라고 계십니다."
ENG_unite_the_voters_desc:0 "수상은 잉글랜드 유권자들을 정부의 품 안에서 결집시키기를 희망합니다. 근왕당이 여전히 잉글랜드에서 가장 인기가 많은 정당이기는 하지만, 이런 상태를 유지하기 위해 제도에 아주 약간 영향을 끼쳤다는 것은 비밀이 아닙니다. 따라서 국민들은 정부를 전적으로 지지하고 있지 않으며, HMMLR의 지지율 상승도 이렇게 설명 가능합니다. 대중이 저항세력을 지지하지 않도록 막기 위해서는 이 불확신한 시대에 국민을 하나로 모으기 위한 캠페인을 벌여야 하며, 모두 잘 해결될 것이라고 유권자들을 안심시켜 주어야 합니다."

ENG_secure_our_heads_desc:0 "할더장군은 HMMLR과 이 섬을 감염시키는 불평분자에 대항하는 싸움을 계속하는데 필요한 장비를 제공하는 것을 상당히 꺼리고 있습니다. 보통 예의상 우리가 이런 말을 먼저 꺼내는 쪽은 별로 없지만, 현 정부는 지금 잘 해가고 있으며 진실로 인내심을 잃어가는 중입니다. 만약 좋은 말로 문제를 해결할 수 없다면, 어쩌면 우리가 원한다면 무엇까지 할 수 있는지 상기시키는 것으로 문제를 해결할 수 있을 것입니다.\n\n잉글랜드 사람들이 전격전 에 휩쓸리던 당시 경험했던 대로, 음식 선택의 자유가 줄어든다면 사기에 진짜로 위험한 영향이 갑니다. 그리고 이 훌륭한 독일 병사들은 독일에서 온 통조림 식량을 먹는 것뿐만이 조국을 기쁘게 할 것이라는 점을 깨닫게 될 것입니다. 하지만 뱃속에는 꽤나 가혹한 처사겠지요. 할더에게 명확한 메세지를 보낼 것입니다. 우리가 할더의 병사들이 먹는 식량을 통제합니다. 그리고 우리는 그들의 식단에 메뉴 한두가지를 너무도 손쉽게 추가해줄 수 있는 결정권을 가지고 있습니다.."

ENG_britannia_on_her_knees_desc:0 "프란츠 할더는 공식적인 지위와는 달리 콘월에서 반대자 없는 직접 통치권을 갖고 있습니다. 이런 상황을 바꾸려는 행동을 취한다면 독일의 십자선 안으로 우리 모두가 들어가게 될 것입니다. 이런 상황은 우리가 감당할 수 없습니다. 심지어 우리가 주둔군의 지원을 바란다면, 구걸에 가까운 간청을 해야 합니다.\n\n할더는 분명 물질적이든 정신적이든 뭔가 보상을 요구할게 분명하고, 우리는 그걸 지불해야만 합니다. HMMLR과 공산주의자, 탈영병을 위시한 거짓된 여왕에게 충성을 바치는 모든 이를 파괴시킬 그에게 보상을 줘야 합니다. 이런 희생은 선뜻 하기는 힘들지만, 이 시대에는 우리 자신만을 생각할 것이 아니라 실패할 경우 대가를 치르게 될 후세대까지 생각해야 합니다."
ENG_prevent_an_icarus_desc:0 "그리스 전설에는 태양 가까이로 다가갔다가 타죽은 한 소년의 이야기가 있습니다. 잉글랜드는 독일에 항복했습니다. 우리 힘으로 저들을 무찌른다는 목적은 현실성도 없고 불가능하기까지 했기 때문입니다. 그렇게 했다면 이카루스와 같은 결말을 맞이했겠지요. 하지만 반군은 이런 사실을 인정할 생각이 없어 보입니다. 저들을 무슨 대가를 치르더라도 권력에서 떨어트려야 하는가를 명백하게 보여주는 냉혹한 선례를 말이지요.\n\n이런 가능성에 대응하기 위한 가장 간단한 해결책은 경찰 병력에 전반적인 자금 지원량을 늘리는 것입니다. 게다가 경찰력은 HMMLR의 위치를 포착하는 능력에 있어서 엄청난 도움을 줄 뿐만 아니라 최악의 사태가 발생할 경우 저들을 물리치는데도 도움이 될 것입니다."
ENG_the_garrison_grows_desc:0 "우리가 다시 미국의 변덕 아래에 예속되는 상황을 막는 임무를 맡고 파견된 콘월 주둔군은 잉글랜드에서 라이히의 오른팔과도 같은 존재입니다. 물론 이런 부대는 받아들일만 하지만, 이들의 규모는 너무도 작기 때문에 대규모 저항보다는 작은 반란을 진압하는데다 도움이 될 것입니다. 아서 체스터턴은 이런 상황을 바꾸려는 의도를 품고 있으며, 국왕에게 주둔군이 HMMLR 조직과 잉글랜드의 온전성을 저해하기 위한 비밀 음모에 효과적으로 대응할 수 있도록 규모를 늘려 달라고 요청을 보낼 것을 상주했습니다. 이런 조치가 우리 군이나 국민들에게 인기가 없을 지도 모릅니다만, 생존과 명예 중에서 고르라면 항상 생존이 우선해야만 합니다. 언제나 그렇지요. 그렇지 않다면 우리가 여기에 있을 이유가 없습니다."
ENG_locate_the_snakes_head_desc:0 "이 모든 사건들의 배후에 누군가 있습니다. HMMLR의 지도자가 모든 것을 뒤에서 조직하고 있습니다. 그가 이 활동의 배후이며 분명 다시 공격을 감행할 것입니다. 그를 추적하고 사살해야 합니다. 지도자를 잃은 저항군은 사분오열될 것이며 우리는 끔찍한 재앙을 피할 수 있을 것입니다. 저 개자식만 처치한다면 우리가 이길겁니다.\n\n그가 어디에 숨어있는지만 알 수 있다면 말이지요."
ENG_Collab_not_enough_time_desc:0 "독일이 혼란에 빠졌습니다. 히틀러의 후계자를 칭하는 이들이 곳곳에서 일어나 서로 싸우고 있습니다. 이제 라이히에서 플리머스 주둔지에 위치한 얼마 되지도 않는 목적 없는 부대 주둔군을 돕기 위한 지원을 보낼 리가 없다는 점이 명백해졌습니다.\n\n반군도 이 점을 매우 잘 알고 있습니다. 저들에게 있어서 이보다 더 좋은 기회는 없습니다. 그들이 세운 모든 계획과 여태껏 해온 모든 음모와 준비를 이 시점에 활용할 것입니다. 우리가 이처럼 힘을 잃어 약해질 때가 다시 돌아올리 없기 때문입니다. 가장 거대한 시련의 시간이 다가올 것이 분명합니다.\n\n신이시어 잉글랜드를 보우하소서!"

ENG_days_of_the_resistance_desc:0 "오킨렉, 알렉산더, 그리고 스털링. 오킨렉은 항복 요구가 울려 퍼질 때 가장 마지막까지 서 있었지만, 그의 이름을 아는 이들은 그리 많지 않습니다. 알렉산더는 케이블 스트리트를 탈출한 몇 안 되는 반란군인 동시에, 그 비극을 끊임없이 상기시키는 이로써 대중들에게 가장 높은 인지도를 가지고 있습니다. 스털링은 그를 사냥하는 사람들 - 그중에서도 아직 살아 있는 사람들만이 그를 알고 있습니다.\n\n이 단체들은 수많은 회원이 가진 정치적 성향만큼이나 수많은 대의에 헌신하는 단체인 HMMLR을 대표하지만, 부인할 수 없는 자유 잉글랜드에 대한 열망으로 뭉쳤습니다. 폭정과 반역자들, 그리고 게르만 국으로부터 자유로운 잉글랜드를 말이죠. 이 협력은 투쟁의 수단 중 하나이지만, 이곳의 모든 이들은 부역자들이 패배하거나 그들이 그것을 시도하다 죽을 때까지 끝장을 보려 합니다."
ENG_stirlings_methods_desc:0 "대부분의 HMMLR은 음습한 일들에 관여하는 것을 꺼립니다. 그렇다 해도, 그것들이 전부 끔찍한 일인 것은 사실이기에 그들을 비난할 수만은 없습니다. 반역자의 차량에 폭탄을 설치하고, 밤에 운 없는 배신자의 집에서 무장한 채 대기하는 것과 같은 일들은 요원에게 조금이나마 회의감을 갖게 합니다. 하지만 그들은 우리들을 독일에 팔아넘겼고, 우리는 그 빚을 갚아줄 필요가 있습니다.\n\n우리가 정직했듯 좌익 저항군들도 그러했지만, 그들은 그것을 배워야만 했습니다. 케이블 스트리트에서의 전투는 그들이 가진 '최고'들을 모조리 잃게 했으며, 그 악명높은 붉은 장군조차 그가 할 수 있는 다른 일들처럼 허공에서 신병들을 만들어 낼 수는 없었습니다. 스털링은 우리에게 이 싸움이 처음부터 더러웠다는 것을 가르쳐 주었습니다. 그 무엇도 주지 말고, 받지 말아야 하며, 죽고 난 후에도 싸워라. 어째서 전장에서 수천 명을 학살하는 것보다 만찬에서 수십 명을 암살하는 것이 더 불명예스럽단 말입니까?"
ENG_a_couple_of_tongues_desc:0 "입을 조심하지 않으면 화를 야기한다. 그것은 어쨌든 그들이 배신자로 밝혀지기 전에 정부가 우리에게 말했던 것입니다. 그런데도, 그 훌륭한 지혜는 그 어느 때보다도 더 많이 적용되는 말입니다. 빨갱이들이 케이블 스트리트에서 실패한 원인의 절반은 그들의 통신망이 정교하지 않았기 때문입니다. 그렇기에 그들은 거사 전까지 위태로운 몇 달을 보내야 했으며, 결국 그들의 혁명이 시작했을 때 배신자들은 이미 총을 들고 그들을 기다리고 있었습니다.\n\n스털링은 최고의 지도자는 아니지만, 그는 뭐가 뭔지 알고 있습니다. 우린 더이상 붙잡은 스파이들을 바다에 던져버리기만 해서는 안 됩니다. 우리는 먼저 그들이 배신자들에게 뭐라고 말했는지 알아내야 합니다. 그들이 대화를 원하지 않는다고요? 뭐, 우리의 품격에는 맞지 않겠지만, 우리는 아름다운 본보기를 만드는 방법을 잘 알고 있습니다."
ENG_who_dares_wins_desc:0 "스털링은 전쟁 중에 SAS를 지휘했고, 나치 놈들이 영국에 상륙하기 전까지 아프리카에서 그들과 싸웠습니다. 물론 그는 그 모든 일을 할 때 써먹을 비결을 한두 개 정도 알아냈습니다. 어떻게 하면 포로들이 정보를 술술 부어낼지, 어떻게 장비를 공중 수색과 기타 감시로부터 숨길 수 있는지 같은 것들 말이죠. 하지만 그의 깨달음 중 가장 중요한 건 당신보다 더 빌어먹을 누군가와 싸울 때는 언제나 선제공격이 최고라는 것입니다.\n\n반역자들은 당신이 무기를 훔쳐 간다면 싸울 수 없습니다. 아무리 탱크라도 궤도의 접지면에 다이너마이트가 끼워져 있다면 움직일 수 없으며, 최고의 비행기들이라도 엔진에 수류탄이 던져진다면 그걸 달갑게 여기진 않을 겁니다. 정정당당한 싸움이란 건 정정당당히 죽고자 했던 이들의 것이지, 명예 없는 반역자들의 것이 아닙니다. 우리는 그들에게 그 무엇도 주지 않을 것입니다."
ENG_taking_the_midlands_desc:0 "잉글랜드의 미들랜드 지역은 평지 지형으로, 언덕이 많지 않고 소수의 삼림지대만이 들판과 마을의 끝없는 풍경을 잠시 가로막을 뿐입니다. 게릴라전이 잘 먹힐 것이라 기대되는 지형은 아니죠. 그러나 그것이 바로 데이비드 스털링이 지난 20년 동안 해온 일입니다.\n\n스털링은 HMMLR이 국가의 중심에서 투쟁을 시작해 처음부터 협력 정부의 군세를 양분하고, 중부 지방의 도시에 있는 중요 산업들의 통제권을 얻도록 하고자 합니다. 버밍엄은 영국 전역에 탄약과 총을 공급하기 위한 훌륭한 집결지입니다. 빌 알렉산더는 미들랜드 지역이 좌익 저항 세력의 본진과 거리가 멀기 때문에 소극적인 움직임을 보이고 있지만, 그는 이 문제에 대한 오킨렉의 판단에 기꺼이 복종할 것입니다."
ENG_an_order_to_hand_over_desc:0 "반역자들은 스스로 생각할 수 있는 대부분의 군대를 숙청했습니다. 적어도 스털링은 그들의 시체를 보고 조롱할 때 그런 말을 하곤 합니다. 반란에 대해 생각해보면, 반역자들을 쏴갈 길 총이 없다면 모든 게 금방 끝날 거라는 겁니다. 빨갱이들이라도 우리가 모두 무장할만한 충분한 양의 총기를 운송할 수는 없습니다. 이점이 우리의 운명을 좌우할 것입니다.\n\n군대에서 보안 프로토콜은 해마다 그렇게 많이 바뀌지 않습니다. 즉, 아주 심술궂게 생긴 대령이 대체 왜 아직도 굼벵이처럼 짐을 쌀 준비가 안 되었는지 묻는 트럭 행렬과 함께 군수창고로 오면, 근무 중인 불쌍한 짐꾼들은 빠릿빠릿하게 짐을 날라준다는 것이죠. 물론 내부적으로는 우리측 인원들 몇 명이 도와줄 것입니다. 듣자 하니 그곳엔 반자동 소총만 해도 2만 정이 넘는다고 하더군요."

ENG_operation_bad_morning_desc:0 "몇몇 빨갱이들이 그렇게 생각하는 것과는 별개로, 반역자들이 처음부터 전부 썩어빠졌다고 믿는다면 편하겠지만 그것은 진실이 아닙니다. 슬픈 사실은 우리와 싸우는 대부분의 이들은 이 사실을 잘 알지 못합니다, 그렇기에 잉글랜드 점령의 의미를 알고 행동하고자 하는 이들을 우리에게 합류시키는 것이 가장 중요한 이유입니다.\n\n제럴드 템플러는 1차 세계대전 때 독일과의 전쟁에서 영국을 위해 싸웠었습니다. 부끄럽게도, 2번째 전쟁에서 그의 허리는 결국 굽혀지고 말았습니다. 그 개자식은 그 조약에 서명한 사람 중 하나였으며, 그의 행보에 얼마나 조언이 주어지더라도 그는 결코 그 원인에 관심을 가지지 않았습니다. 위험부담이 크긴 하지만, 우리는 그의 운전사를 알고 있습니다. 만약 우리가 그의 차에 선물을 몰래 가지고 들어갈 수 있다면 우리는 온 세상이 지켜볼 한 방을 먹여줄 수 있을지도 모릅니다."

HMMLR이 충성하는 사람은 그 누구도 아닌 오킨렉입니다."
ENG_the_leader_speaks_desc:0 "클로드 오킨렉이 영국의 해방을 위해 싸워오면서 아주 잘 알게 된 것이 있다면, 선전은 매우 유용하다는 것입니다. 그러나 평범한 대중들이 HMMLR의 루머에 둘러싸인 지도자가 수상쩍은 체스 마스터라는 사실을 알게 되었을 때, 그들은 그에게 불안감을 느낄지도 모릅니다. 그렇기에 오킨렉은 위험을 무릅쓰고 HMMLR 단원을 대상으로 한 첫 공개 연설을 했습니다. \n\n그의 신분을 감추기 위한 스카프를 쓰고 녹음된 음성에 약간의 개조를 가함으로서, 아무도 햄프셔 출신의 온화하고 매너 있는 하원의원이 HMMLR의 가장 악명높고 전투적인 이들에게 연설하는 사람이라는 것을 짐작하지 못할 것입니다. 그것은 많은 주제에 관한 연설이었습니다: 영국 토양의 파괴, 순교자들의 부당한 투옥, 한때 존경받았던 기관의 부패. 수많은 이야기가 오갔지만, 마지막 순간에 그 연설을 들은 이들이 외친 것은 동일했습니다. 신께서 여왕 폐하를 보우하시길."
ENG_flood_of_volunteers_desc:0 "의회 의원이자 전쟁 영웅으로서 클로드 오킨렉은 영국의 많은 사람으로부터 꽤 존경을 받습니다. 그는 결국 칼라일에 마지막으로 서 있었던 사람이었으며, 그렇기에 그는 많은 공공 행사를 개최하는 것 외에도 여러 자선 단체의 후원자가 되었습니다.\n\n그러한 행사들에서 HMMLR 단원 모집이 빈번히 일어난다는 것은 우연에 불과하며, 오킨렉이 현재의 사회질서에 불만을 가질만한 사람들에게 다가가 말을 건네는 것 또한 어쩌다 일어난 일일 뿐입니다. 오킨렉은 HMMLR이 현재 가진 힘에 전적으로 의존해서는 안 된다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 해방의 날이 도래할 때, 총을 잡을 수 있는 사람이라면 그 누구라도 필요할 것입니다. 그의 노력 덕분에, 예상보다 더 많은 이들이 함께해 줄 것입니다."

ENG_operation_stock_desc:0 "군수품 부족은 우리 조직의 고질병입니다. 밀수는 문제를 완화하는 것에 불과하며, 중화기의 경우 우리 중 최고의 무장을 갖춘 부대 중에서도 찾아보기 힘듭니다. 스톡 작전의 목표는 이 문제를 해결하는 것입니다. 칼라일 근처의 몇몇 오래된 군수창고들은 수많은 수류탄과 심지어 독일인들이 약탈하지 못한 구식 탱크들을 포함한 무기들로 가득 차 있습니다.\n\n그러나, 시설이 보호되고 있기 때문에 우리는 그러한 고급 장비들을 대피시키는데 적어도 6시간이 필요할 것이며, 이것은 그 지역 협력주의자들의 군대가 눈치채지 못하도록 지역을 잠잠하게 해야 한다는 뜻입니다. 다행히도 독일 주둔군은 멀리 떨어져 있기에 불가능한 작전은 아닙니다. 하지만 우리에겐 약간의 행운과 소음기 몇 개가 필요할 것입니다."

HMMLR이 폭발물이 필요할 때, 혹은 그들이 메시지를 전달할 필요가 있을 때 그들은 우리에게 도움을 청합니다. 비록 그 많은 군주론자는 반동분자일 수도 있지만, 핵심적인 문제에 있어 그들은 우리와 뜻을 같이하고 있습니다. 우리가 결착을 내고 난 뒤 잉글랜드는 자유롭거나, 자유롭게 죽을 겁니다."
ENG_under_their_noses_desc:0 "밀수가 위엄있는 활동은 아닐지 몰라도 혁명은 병사들만의 힘으로는 이루어지지 않습니다. 우리는 총을 든 청년들만큼이나 기술자와 트럭 정비사, 공장 노동자가 필요한 데다, 최근의 잉글랜드는 보급품을 생산하는 것이 꽤 어렵습니다. 그러므로 남부의 항구들과 그 배들의 끊임없는 흐름은 우리에게 매우 중요합니다. 사전에 언질을 준다면, 우리는 이틀 후에 리버풀 부두에서 런던이나 칼리스로 낡은 양키 소총을 수송할 수 있으며, 파시스트 경비병들에게 뇌물을 먹일 필요가 없다면 시간은 더 단축될 것입니다. \n\n물론 신출귀몰한 우리의 능력은 다른 용도로 사용할 수 있습니다. 저녁 산책 중인 파시스트 공무원 몇 명을 실종시킨다든가 하는 방식으로 말입니다."
ENG_win_with_wingate_desc:0 "혁명은 고위직을 가진 이들 중에도 혁명을 도와줄 동지가 있습니다. 이 어려운 시기에 살아남기 위해서는 그렇게 해야만 했습니다. 그들 중 한 명은 오드 윙게이트라는 정부에서 일하는 장군입니다. 분명 파시스트들은 전쟁이 끝난 후 일본과 그의 석방을 협상할 때 그를 자신의 것으로 생각했겠지만, 윙게이트는 누가 그를 버리고 그의 병사들을 죽게 했는지 잊지 않았습니다. 또한 그는 우리의 계획에 가장 수용적인 인물이기도 했습니다.\n\n윙게이트는 파시스트 정부에 접근하여 전쟁 말기에 멋대로 굴기 시작한 스털링과 그의 특공대를 추적하고 물리치기 위한 같은 전술을 사용하는 부대를 훈련할 수 있을지의 허락을 구하기 위해 접근할 것입니다. 물론 윙게이트가 실제로 할 일은 파시스트를 무릎 굽힐 붉은 군대의 기반을 훈련하는 것입니다."
ENG_moving_south_desc:0 "잉글랜드 남부는 미래의 저항군들에게 우호적인 장소가 아닙니다. HMMLR은 가능한 한 그것을 피하고 그 스털링조차도 절대적으로 필요한 것보다 콘월 주둔군의 반감을 사기를 원치 않습니다. 만일 그렇다면, 남부가 파시즘의 군화들과 가장 가까이 있음에도 공장들과 부두들을 중심으로 한 좌익 저항군을 지원하는 핵심 지역이라는 사실은 매우 인상적으로 여겨질 것입니다.\n\n남부에서 반란을 일으키는 것은 위험한 제안이지만, 만약 우리가 초기의 성공을 이용할 수 있다면 상당한 이득을 취할 수 있을 것입니다. 런던을 포위하는 것은 우리들이 더욱 합법적인 정부처럼 보이게 할 것이며, 콘월 주둔군은 독일에 지원을 요청하기도 전에 고립시키고 제거할 수 있습니다. 알렉산더는 또한 주어진 시간에 혁명가들을 군대에 동원할 수 있다고 약속했습니다만, 스털링은 회의적인 견해를 보이고 있습니다. 결정은 오킨렉의 몫입니다."
ENG_o_canada_desc:0 "캐나다는 파시스트 군주제와 대비되는 반동적인 군주제의 본고장으로 유명합니다. 하지만 좌익 저항군, 더 나아가 HMMLR에게 중요한 점은 노동당 지하조직이 그곳에 쓸만한 연줄을 가지고 있다는 것입니다. 이러한 지지 대부분은 정치적인 지지로, 망명 공동체와 캐나다 정부에 우리의 투쟁의 정당함을 알려줍니다. 그러나 그만큼 캐나다에서의 물자적 지원 또한 중요한 양을 차지하고 있습니다.\n\n빌 알렉산더는 혁명이 살아남기 위해서는 동맹이 필요하다는 주장을 계속해 왔으며, 지금까지 그를 틀렸다고 말할 수 있는 사람은 극소수에 불과합니다. 케이블 스트리트의 사건을 고려할 때, 캐나다는 우리의 소중한 동아줄입니다. 이제는 그것을 폭넓게 활용할 때가 올인지도 모릅니다."

ENG_be_more_practical_desc:0 "왜 보스가 우리에게 콘월로 향하라고 했는지는 너무나도 명백합니다. 우리는 독일인들과 너무나도 사이가 험악합니다. 스털링은 우리가 합류 지점에 도착하기도 전부터 계획을 짜고 있었으며, 그 계획은 엄청난 양의 폭발물들 이상의 것을 포함하고 있습니다.\n\n콘월의 재미있는 점은 우리가 일반적으로 폭파하거나 훔치거나 죽일 수 없는 것들이 그곳에 있다는 사실입니다. 기반시설, 상자 가득 실은 독일제 최신형 무기들, 심지어는 조심성 없는 독일 장교들도 우리를 기다리고 있는 마냥 길모퉁이에 서 있습니다. 물론 경비가 삼엄하고 특공대원들이 오래 머물 기회는 없지만, 그것을 계속할 수 있는 동안은 재미를 보아야만 합니다."
ENG_take_whats_ours_desc:0 "독일군의 군수창고가 평범한 군수창고보다 훨씬 더 흥미진진한 이유는 길 가던 행인을 공격해서는 안 된다 따위의 일들에 대해 고려조차 하지 않아도 되기 때문입니다. 게다가, 놈들이 갖고 노는 물건들은 우리가 평소에 쓰던 장난감들보다 훨씬 더 큽니다.\n\n스털링은 우리가 훔쳐낸 모든 물자들을 오킨렉과 사령부로 이송할 수 있는 경로를 원합니다. 부두에서 알렉산더의 부하들과 접선할 수 있다고 가정한다면 아마도 가능할 것 같습니다. 육지의 국경 경계선은 스털링의 방식에 맡기에는 너무나 철저하게 방비되고 있으니 말이죠."

ENG_operation_franz_desc:0 "프란츠 할더는 철권통치로 잉글랜드를 억압하고 있는 사내입니다.  그의 콘월 주둔군은 라이히의 의지를 집행하고, 그가 그의 죗값을 치렀어야 할 때는 오래전에 지났습니다. 그에게 무언가를 시도할 기회는 좀처럼 생기지 않을 것이기에, 우리는 그를 암살하기로 했습니다. 그 남자와 그의 이너서클은 대체할 수 없는 장교들인 데다, 잉글랜드에 관해 정통한 이들이기에 작전이 성공한다면 우리가 받는 어떤 역습도 충분히 가치가 있을 것입니다. \n\n계획 자체에는 발생 가능한 몇 가지 위험 요소들이 있습니다. 우리가 의도적으로 왔다 갔다 하고 있으며, 주둔군과 협력 정부는 이때까지 일어난 모든 일을 인지하고 있습니다. 성패 여부와 상관없이, 그날 이후로 수비대는 몇 달간 고강도의 경계 태세를 유지할 것이며, 두 번째 기회는 오지 않을 것입니다. 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 그저 그들에게 행운을 빌어주는 것뿐입니다."
ENG_HMMLR_not_enough_time_desc:0 "시간은 우리의 편이 아닙니다. 협력 정부도 이 사실을 알고 있습니다. 우리는 지금까지 우리를 뿌리 뽑기 위한 그들의 시도를 저지했지만, 하루가 갈수록 더 많은 총기가 생산되고, 더 많은 사람들이 징집당하고, 더 많은 수의 우리측 조직들이 발각당합니다.\n\n오킨렉, 알렉산더, 그리고 스털링은 함께 논의하였고, 결론을 냈습니다. 지금이 바로 그때입니다. 해방을 위한, 혁명을 위한, 복수를 위한 전쟁이. 자유 잉글랜드를 위한 전쟁이. 더 나은 잉글랜드를 위해, 잉글랜드의 모든 이들을 위해. 우리의 명분과 함께하여 무기를 들고자 한 남자와 여자들이 준비되었으며, 그들은 우리의 적을 공격할 명령만을 기다리고 있습니다. 아마 언젠가는 이 일이 노래로 기억되겠지만, 우리는 그저 그 노래가 슬픈 노래가 아니길 바랄 뿐입니다."

HMMLR의 반역자들과 공산주의자들은 붙잡히거나 죽거나 아니면 도망쳤습니다. 그들을 뒤에서 후원해준 미국은 영향권을 주장하려는 시도를 잠시 포기한 듯 합니다. 이를 위해 수천 수만 명의 피가 흘렀습니다.\n\n이런 비극 속에서도 아직 우리는 미래를 내다볼 수 있습니다. 잉글랜드는 여전히 독립을 지키고 있으며 대서양 저편에서 온 기생충에게 복종해야 하는 의무에서 자유로워졌습니다. 이제 우리는 잃어버린 모든 것들을 다시 건설할 수 있습니다. 최근 20년간 잉글랜드를 이끌어온 정부가 현재도 계속해서 지도하고 있습니다. 다행히도 이런 상황이 앞으로도 오랫동안 지속될 것입니다."
ENG_a_message_for_edward_desc:0 "앨릭 더글러스-흄은 20년 넘는 기간동안 정부라는 배를 잘 이끌어온 가장 성공적인 잉글랜드 수상입니다. 그는 내부 분쟁중인 근왕당을 하나로 뭉치게 만들고, 정부 기관에 피해를 입힌 갈등과 부패를 시정하기 위해 강경파와 개혁파를 무시할 수 없는 한 세력으로 융합한 인물입니다.\n\n하지만 전쟁은 사람들에게 엄청난 피해를 입히고, 심지어 내전은 한때 친구이자 동료였고 전우면서 동포였던 당신의 명령을 받은 이들을 죽음으로 몰아넣었습니다. 더글러스-흄 수상은 국왕에게 사임 의사를 밝힐 예정인데, 그의 후계자는 젊은 여성 대처로 이미 내정되어 있습니다. 그녀는 어느 기준으로 봐도 영리한 인물이며 당은 그녀가 권력을 잡는 한 계속해서 지지를 보낼 것입니다. 이런 변화를 발표하기에 지금보다 더 좋은 시점은 없습니다."
ENG_the_oxford_trials_desc:0 "HMMLR은 2차 세계대전에서 우리나라를 폐허로 이끌어간 집단의 일원이었던 윈저 가문의 실패한 분가의 이름으로 싸웠습니다. 아마도 저들이 완전히 패배하지 않았다는 사실은 그다지 놀라운 일이 아닐 것입니다. 우리가 수천명의 HMMLR 대원을 포로로 잡고 있다는 사실은 일단 차치해두고, 저들에게 뭔가 조치를 취해야 합니다. 런던 안에는 없을게 분명하고, 너무 많은 이들이 둘러싸고 있으며 일이 잘못 흘러갈 확률도 너무 높습니다.\n\n옥스포드는 HMMLR 지도자들을 아무런 문제 없이 이송할 수 있을 정도로 충분히 가깝습니다. 충돌로 완전히 파괴된 대학가 터 한가운데에서 그토록 하찮은 이유를 내세우며 우리나라를 산산조각낸 이들의 운명을 결정할 것입니다. 저들의 행보가 독일의 재침공을 초래할 가능성을 불러일으켰을지도 모른다는 점은 차치하고서 말이지요. 빠르고 공개적으로 저들에게 정의를 구현하십시오.."
ENG_meeting_with_montomery_desc:0 "버나드 몽고메리는 최근 수십 년간 최고의 군사 지휘관으로 복무해 왔습니다. 누군가 라이히와 직면했을 때 그가 실패했다면서 무시할지도 모르지만, 그는 자신에게 대적하는 모든 상대방을 물리쳤습니다. 내전 동안에는 한때 자신의 동료들이 몰려왔음에도 그들과 맞서 싸웠습니다. 말 나온 김에 첨언하자면, 몽고메리의 존재로 인해 우리가 가장 공포스러운 충돌에서 승리할 수 있었기 때문에 그에게 상당한 보상을 줘야 합니다.\n\n몽고메리의 복무에 보답하기 위해 열병식과 기념 메달들을 수여 할 예정이며 기념물도 몇 개 제작할 것입니다. 하지만 그에게 조만간 이루어질 지도력의 변화도 알려야만 합니다. 그가 옛 경비대의 일원일지도 모르지만, 몽고메리는 후임자만큼이나 안정의 가치를 중시합니다. 따라서 우리는 그가 옳은 일을 할 것이라는 점을 잘 알고 있습니다."
ENG_an_announcement_for_everyone_desc:0 "더글러스-흄은 오래전에 근왕당 수뇌부 온건파 당원들을 상대로 승계 문제를 해결한 바 있습니다. 마거릿 대처는 개혁파의 교묘한 정치적 수작이나 강경파의 폭력적인 선동정치적 성향에 정신을 잃지 않을 만큼 충분히 총명합니다. 한편으로는 동시에 그녀가 근왕당 자체의 목표에서 벗어날 수 있도록 해줄 정치적 기반이 없기도 합니다. 온건파가 피와 땀 그리고 눈물을 흘리며 얻은 권력을 가질 것입니다.\n\n이제 이 건은 나머지 국가에 수뇌부 변화가 있으리라는 점을 알리는 정도로 매우 사소한 문제가 되었습니다. 잘 될겁니다. 여태껏 열두명의 잉글랜드 수상이 사임했었다고요? 거리에 있는 사람들이 그런 사실을 잘 알고 있을지 의문입니다."
ENG_and_now_its_on_fire_desc:0 "뭐, 누군가는 "다른 파벌 지도부에 수상이 사임했고 신임 수상이 취임했다고 알리는" 문제 전체가 끔찍하게 잘못되어가고 있다고 말할지도 모르겠습니다. 끔찍하게도 소위 말하는 근왕당은 정부 내에서 더 이상 다수당이 아닙니다. 새 정당을 창당하기 위해 우리와 함께 일할 무소속 의원을 충분히 구할 수도 없습니다.\n\n"왕실 이혼" 사건이 점차 널리 알려졌고, 이 사실은 잉글랜드에 조만간 새로운 선거가 열릴 수 밖에 없다는 점을 시사합니다. 근왕당 치하에서 여태껏 치러졌던 이전 선거들과는 달리 이번 선거에는 충분히 가능성 있는 진지한 반대파가 존재하며 그들이 출마하지 못하도록 막을 어떤 효과적인 방법도 없는 상황입니다. 이 나라의 미래가 공중에 던져진 동전처럼 붕 떠 있습니다. 그리고 누구도 이 동전이 어디로 떨어질지 모릅니다. 개혁일까요 아니면 안정일까요?"
ENG_no_chance_to_win_mac_desc:0 "근왕당은 안정과 안전, 그리고 흔들리지 않는 강철의 의지를 지향하는 정당입니다. 마거릿 대처는 아직 어릴지도 모릅니다. 하지만 그녀는 2차 세계대전의 폭력 속에서 자랐고 내전 와중에 수많은 다른 이들이 욕망이나 이상을 따라 도망치던 와중에도 살아남았습니다. 그리고 다른 이는 누구도 할 수 없었던 근왕당 중도파를 하나로 결집시키는 업적을 이뤘습니다. 맥밀란과 멍청한 체스터턴이 알아서 자기 주장을 계속하도록 놔두십시오. 하지만 어찌되었든간에 우리 기억 속에서 살아있는 가장 큰 위기 와중에서 우리나라를 이끌어온 집단은 저들이 아니었습니다.\n\n우리가 바로 우리가 발딛고 서있는 이 섬처럼 절대 움직이지 않는 근왕당입니다. 그리고 우리는 절대로 잉글랜드가 과거에 라이히를 상대로 승리할 희망이 없는 싸움을 벌이던 시절의 멍청한 지도자들에게 시달리도록 두지 않을 것입니다. 어떤 대가를 치르더라도 이 역행의 시대에서 벗어나 다시 한번 승리를 향해 나아갈 것입니다."
ENG_not_so_easy_desc:0 "어떤 정당에서 전체 당원의 삼분의 일이 한꺼번에 탈당하는 상황을 준비되지 않은 상태에서 직면한 하락세로 바라볼수도 있습니다. 하지만 우리 정당은 잉글랜드 집권 정당이기 때문에 몇 가지 이점을 가지고 있습니다. 예를 들어 어떤 정치인이 누구에게서 언제 뇌물을 받았는지를 알고 있지요. 조심스럽게 뒷주머니로 뇌물을 조금 받는다고 해도, 누군가 이를 공식 문서에서 언급하게 된다면 더 이상 조심스러운 뇌물이 아니게 됩니다. 그리고 우리는 결별을 원하는 당원에게 이런 일들을 드러낼 수 있다는 점은 말할 필요도 없습니다.\n\n만약 저들이 우리 당을 그토록 심각하게 떠나고 싶어한다면, 저들이 우리의 이익을 위해 일했기 때문에 우리가 저런 짓을 알고도 봐줬다는 점을 상기시켜 줘야 합니다. 당을 떠난다는 뜻은 동시에 우리의 보호력이 미치는 영향권에서 나간다는 것을 의미합니다. 일이 잘못되었을때 수치심을 느낄 이들이 몇명 있지는 않을까요?"
ENG_we_wont_stop_winning_desc:0 "근왕당은 잉글랜드의 존엄과 전통을 대표하는 정당입니다. 아름다운 우리나라가 갈등과 곤경의 한 해를 지나는 동안 조국을 이끌어온 이들이 누구였을까요? 우리나라를 재난과 폭력으로부터 지켜온 이들이 누구였을까요? 그건 파시스트나 자유주의자가 아니었으며, 당신이 확신에 차서 예상하고 있는 바로 그들입니다.\n\n우리가 지난 수년간 성취해온 수많은 성취를 지적할 때는 협박과 같은 옹졸한 방법에 의존할 필요가 없습니다. 우리가 어마어마한 자금을 재건 노력과 고아원에 지원하고 있다는 것은 벌써 널리 알려져 있으며, 이런 사실이 대중에서 우리의 지지율을 낮추지는 않을 것입니다. 이런 생각을 하는 대신에, 상대편이 가장 결정적으로 우리의 선례를 따르지 않거나 아니면 최소화하고 있다는 점을 지적할 가치가 있을지도 모릅니다. 둘 모두 효과가 있겠지만, 우리는 돈을 반대파를 확실히 떨어트리는것 보다는 사람들을 옳은 방향으로 돌려놓는데 사용하고 있습니다."
ENG_anyone_but_chesterton_desc:0 "잉글랜드 통합당에 대해 말해봅시다. 그들은 멍청할지도 모르는 목표를 추구하기는 하지만, 그래도 끔찍한 이상을 향하지는 않습니다. 그저 너무도 빠르고 성급하게 일을 이루려 하는 것뿐입니다. 그들은 우리의 반대파이지 적은 아닙니다. 국민전선에게 이와 똑같은 논리를 적용할 수 없다는 점은 대단히 명확합니다. 우리나라에 명백하게 가장 필요 없는 존재는 바로 정부 주변을 돌아다니는 파시스트들입니다. 정부가 아니라 사회 주변을 돌아다닌다고 해도 큰 차이는 없습니다.\n\n국민전선을 지켜주던 독일 주인님은 더 이상 존재하지 않습니다. 지금이야말로 그들이 대표하는 광적인 개들을 처리할 때입니다. 이를 위해 결연한 운동이 제정되어야 합니다. 심지어 어쩌면 이 문제에 한해서는 잉글랜드 통합당과 협력할 수도 있겠습니다. 결국 잉글랜드 통합당은 우리보다 훨씬 국민전선을 싫어하는 이들이기 때문입니다."
ENG_what_a_useful_old_man_desc:0 "아서 케네스 체스터턴은 한때 위대한 정치인이었지만, 지금은 불쌍하게 주름진 늙은이일 뿐입니다. 그렇기 때문에 파시스트 잉글랜드라는 환상에 현혹되어 조만간 자기가 들어가게 될 무덤을 파는 것조차 눈치채지 못하고 있습니다. 하지만 그걸 기다리고 있을 수만은 없습니다. 체스터턴은 불만에 찬 극우파 전체를 우리가 확인하고 인식할 수 있도록 자신의 아래로 깔끔하게 모으는 일을 잘 해내고 있습니다. 더 중요한 사실은 그가 우리 정당에 반대하는 표들을 분산시키고 있지만 어떤 후보에게도 특별히 인정받고 있지 못하다는 점입니다.\n\n체스터턴이 돌아다니는 한, 잉글랜드 통합당이 의회에서 유효 과반수를 채우기는 불가능에 가까울 정도로 어려울 것입니다. 그 뒤에 그 바보도 직접 처리할 수 있을 것입니다."
ENG_convince_who_we_can_desc:0 "잉글랜드 통합당은 국민전선같이 바보들이나 모인 정당이 아닙니다. 통합당에는 과거 수년간 대처의 동료들이었던 합법적인 방식을 사용할 의지를 가진 남녀들이 모여있습니다. 우리가 맥밀란이 잘못 이끌어간 얼마 되지도 않는 반체제 분자들을 없애버릴 수 없다고 누가 말하겠습니까? 친절하게 행동한다면 우리가 잃어버린 지지기반 중 일부를 되찾을 수 있을지도 모릅니다.\n\n만약 실패한다면 다가올 수 있는 최악의 상황은 무엇일까요? 우리가 선거에서 승리할 가능성이 있는 두 정당 중에서 더 합리적이고 안정적인 이념을 가진 정당으로 보일까요? 뭐, 최악의 시나리오에서도 우리가 잃을 건 아무것도 없으니 이렇게 해봅시다. 확신을 품지 못한 이들에게 팔을 벌리고, 바로 지금 바로 여기에서 우리의 은총을 거부한 우매한 이들을 받아들입시다."
ENG_just_get_rid_of_trouble_desc:0 "우리가 내민 손을 저들이 내쳤을 때는 다른 쪽 손을 내미는 것 보다는 문제의 원인을 제거하는 쪽이 더 낫습니다. 잉글랜드 통합당이 승리하도록 둘 수는 없습니다. 멍청한 모들링이나 책략꾼 맥밀란이 어디든지 진짜 권력에 가까이 다가가게 된다면 우리나라에 재앙과도 같은 결과를 초래하게 될 것입니다. 독일이 기분 나빠하거나, 더 심각한 경우에는 분노를 느낄 수도 있기 때문입니다. 콘월 방위군이 약해지기는 했지만, 그래도 아직 여기에서 계속 주둔하는 중입니다.\n\n부패 혐의로 비교적 영향력 있는 이들을 구속합시다. 언제나 성공하지는 않겠지만 그래도 최소한 저들이 내세우는 정직에 대한 의심을 던질 수 있을 것입니다. 협박을 조금 덧붙이는 것도 나쁜 생각이 아닐지도 모릅니다. 잉글랜드 통합당 자체에는 별 영향이 없더라도, 그들을 지지하는 유권자들에게는 유효할 것입니다. 이것이 근왕당이 해야 할 최후의 행동이라면 이런 말도 안 되는 상황을 멈출 것입니다."
ENG_midlands_is_the_key_desc:0 "잉글랜드 미들랜즈는 잉글랜드 통합당과 우리가 가장 첨예하게 경합하는 지역입니다. 북부는 저들의 표밭이고, 남부와 런던은 대부분 근왕당이 꽉 쥐고 있습니다. 아직 미들랜즈는 누구에게 표를 던질지 확신을 품지 못한 채로 완고한 자세를 지키고 있습니다. 버밍엄과 다른 도시들은 가장 귀찮은 지역입니다.\n\n만약 근왕당이 압도적으로 많은 자금을 미들랜즈 선거운동에 투입한다면 심지어 연합이 붕괴되기 전에도 이번 선거에서 강력한 존재로 대두하게 될 것입니다. 맥밀란과 그의 꼭두각시 모들링도 같은 생각을 하고 있을 지도 모릅니다. 그리고 저들이 우리보다 선수를 치고 이익을 취한다면 승리를 거두기 어려워질 것입니다. 마거릿은 선거 위원회에 빨리 이 문제를 해결해야 한다고 제안했습니다. "
ENG_better_focus_on_the_base_desc:0 "남부는 한때 우리의 거점이었고 아직도 정직하게 지키고 있습니다. 하지만 가장 중요한 선거구 중 일부가 어디에 표를 던질지에 대한 우려의 조짐이 드러나고 있습니다. 대처는 선거에서 이 지역을 확보하는데 선거운동을 집중하라고 지시했습니다. 다른 지역에서 잉글랜드 통합당이 몇 석을 얻었는지는 상관 없이 우리가 남부 지역을 확실하게 손에 넣을 수만 있다면, 최근 백년간 런던을 잃고 승리한 정당이 없었으며 앞으로 백년도 동일할 것이라는 점을 증명할 수 있을 것입니다. 과반수 이상 득표를 얻는 것만큼 화려한 승리가 되지는 않겠지만, 마거릿이 계획한 대로 된다면 평범한 다수당을 차지하는 것 만으로도 충분할 것입니다. 결국 승자가 관리 임용을 손에 넣게 되기 때문입니다."
ENG_their_inevitable_loss_desc:0 "여론조사 결과는 양호해 보이고, 조사 결과 대처를 수상으로 선호한다는 의견이 모들링과 체스터턴에 비해 만족스러울 정도로 많았습니다. 오, 파시스트들과 바보들이 자기 앞에 다가올줄 알았던 과실을 이를 갈면서 바라보고 있는 모습을 보십시오. 근왕당은 수십년간 이 국가를 이끌어 왔는데, 우리가 이룬 업적을 능가할 존재가 과연 어디에 있을까요?\n\n승리는 그저 시간문제일 뿐입니다. 그 운명의 날에 우리는 개혁주의자들이나 극단파와 연대한 완고한 이들의 방해에도 굴하지 않고 나아갈 것입니다. 친애하는 마가렛이 마침내 누구에게 대답할지 기억하고 있는 한, 잉글랜드는 대처의 아래에서 중도파의 길을 걸어갈 것입니다. "
ENG_its_all_against_you_thatcher_desc:0 "수년 전 근왕당이 잉글랜드를 파괴에서 구해냈습니다. 이건 사실입니다. 하지만 한때 고귀한 정당이었던 저들의 권력 기반이 사소한 탐욕과 부패로 물들어갔습니다. 해럴드 맥밀란과 레지날드 모들링은 이런 사실을 꿰뚫어 보았고 근왕당을 설득해 그들이 나아가는 방향을 바꾸어 보려 했지만, 잘 되지 않았습니다. 그렇기 때문에 잉글랜드를 과거에 그랬던 것처럼 개혁하기 위해 잉글랜드 통합당이 창당되었습니다. 자유와 정의, 그리고 민주주의의 땅으로요.\n\n대처를 물리칠 것이고, 국민의 의지를 통해 근왕당을 권좌에서 끌어내릴 것입니다. 그리고 잉글랜드는 결국 저들과 같은 민주적 절차에 반대하는 세력을 일소할 것입니다. 모들링이 이 변화를 주도할 것이며, 맥밀런은 사람들에게 메세지를 명확하게 전달하는 역할을 도맡을 것입니다."
ENG_united_england_the_best_choice_desc:0 "United England is more than a mere attempt to replace the Royal Party, it is a movement to supersede its very existence in every way. Let us show the people of England this not through words but through deeds. Having our members rebuild houses and roads, find families for the orphans, and homes for the homeless, we will prove ourselves to be better connected with the English people than the aristocratic Royal Party.\n\nWe will have votes from the farmer and the factory worker, from the postman and the constable and every working man and woman who has been done wrong by our former friends. Let us right the injustice, and let us correct the errors made by those who care not for the normal Englishman."
ENG_rotten_royal_party_desc:0 "We have successfully brought more than a third of the former Royal Party over to our way of seeing things. Why not go for more? Oh, to be sure, they might not be the most democratically inclined of folks, but Macmillan has a certain way with people which might disabuse them of trying anything untoward. They can get in line with the future of England or they can risk the consequences.\n\nWe need the appearance of broad support in order to stand a chance against the entrenched apparatus of the Royal Party, and who better to help with this than former members of the Royal Party? For those unwilling to see the truth of democracy of course, we can always promise looking the other way about some of their past discretions."
ENG_the_mans_insane_desc:0 "The mere idea that English politics tolerate a literal fascist standing for any parliamentary seat is an outrage of the highest order. It was the fascists who destroyed the United Kingdom, it was the fascists who bombed our homes and salted our fields. We should be hanging Chesterton and all his friends from the nearest belfry, not tolerating their existence in politics.\n\nBut we are a civilised people, we will take our case to the general populace on the matter of Arthur Kenneth Chesterton. Let us examine his every decision, his every act of treachery to the fair people of England. Let us let United England be the ones to show the entire nation his depraved and evil true self. This might not be the most strategic of decisions, but all agree it is what needs to be done if England ever hopes to be a true democracy once again."
ENG_lets_battle_it_out_desc:0 "Arthur Kenneth Chesterton is an utter imbecile. An embarrassment to the very fabric of reasonable English politics. Yet, he has a singular use that will have us tolerate his existence for now. He shares a pool of votes with Margaret Thatcher, that being the far right who would never vote for United England in the first place but might well not vote for Thatcher either.\n\nIf Chesterton is taken out of the political framework too early then he might not get a chance to siphon these votes. We have nothing to worry about, after all he'll never win on his own. We will get to the matter of his fate in the long run, but for now we will just let him be and prepare our options. We are, after all, a civilised people, unlike him."
ENG_a_risky_risky_bet_desc:0 "United England has a greater purpose than merely overthrowing the Royal Party, we seek to restore democracy as well. That cannot always be done by honest tactics, hence why Macmillan and Maudling have amassed some funds for a somewhat nefarious act that will serve a pure goal.\n\nTo put it bluntly, we don't have the political framework the Royal Party enjoys and without friends in all levels of society, United England faces an insurmountable challenge. Many people will side with us, because they do not share our cause, so we will pay them to hear us out. Even if we just get a few hundred friendly faces it will all be worth it, for what is more important in an election than having the voters trust on your side?"
ENG_get_the_money_ready_desc:0 "The Royal Party is fragmenting, falling apart under its own grotesque corruption and weight. Why not seize this opportunity to try and get an outright majority of the former Royal Party MP's inside United England? It would immensely aid our efforts to secure influence, and speed along some of our programmes very nicely.\n\nThere is a risk to this plan. United England attracts voters who want reform and change, so having most of our party be people once affiliated with the moderate RP who mismanaged the country so badly will not do our public perception any favours, to say nothing of what ammunition it might give the opposition. As with all things it is a question of balance - should we risk it, or try something more subtle?"
ENG_midlands_and_only_the_midlands_desc:0 "Amidst the factories and rolling fields of the Midlands lies a great opportunity for United England to secure the election firmly. The Midlands are populous, and unlike the South they might be persuaded to vote for us, not the Royal Party. A concentrated and thorough campaign in the region will give us an outright majority of seats, provided nothing goes wrong, and the Royal Party knows it. Wasting their resources trying to defeat us here rather than aiming for the North will be their downfall.\n\nThe Midlands also represented some of the core HMMLR support back in the Civil War, and the people still remember the names of Bill Alexander and David Stirling with glee in the dark alleys. We might, covertly, promise to keep the idealistic part of that legacy alive."
ENG_northern_english_voting_treasure_desc:0 "The English North is the core of United England, filled with anti-London sentiments which have provided the backbone for our party's growth. If the Royal Party were to oust us here, we would not stand a chance of winning the election. That is why we must guard our seats here carefully. The Midlands are likely not going to vote for us anyway, but should the North falter then we will face a problem not even a miracle might reverse.\n\nLess publicly, the North was the core of HMMLR support, and though misguided we can use these attitudes to serve our own vision of English democracy, so long as we aren't too obvious about appealing to that demographic that is."
ENG_whats_left_to_sort_out_desc:0 "The polls don't lie, Reginald Maudling is the most popular candidate for Prime Minister by a margin greater than Alec Douglas-Home's first ministry, a proper achievement in and of itself. With the election just weeks away we now face the problem of what might do following our victory.\n\nReform is a dangerous word, but Macmillan wants to restore the English democracy no matter what, and to hell with those who suggest we ought to keep some of the Royal Party's corruption around for our own ends. Let the National Front and the Royal Party squabble for the scraps of influence they have left, we will outlast them and leave them in the dustbin of history. Democracy is England's birthright, and we shall deliver."

FEN_a_forgotten_word_england_desc:0 "Freedom, a word the former traitor government would have rather preferred to be unmentioned for the rest of time. Freedom is not simply a word however, it is a state of mind, one that pushes the greatest of men into actions considered impossible. Monarchists and communists, soldiers and labourers and churchmen all worked together not because of force or fear. They fought as one because they would rather die free than live oppressed under the traitor's boots.\n\nHMMLR is victorious, and England is now free of the rule of those who betrayed it to the fascists decades ago. We have won, and from Dover to Carlisle it is the banner of a Free England which flies. We did this not for personal glory, but so that the children born in this land will never again have to witness the jackboot of the Reich."
FEN_assembly_of_heroes_desc:0 "Now that the struggle is won, HMMLR will have to deal with the aftermath. With so many figures in the Collaborationist government refusing to defect it leaves England with something of a deficit of civilian leadership not tied to HMMLR directly. Thus HMMLR must take up the responsibility of planning the nations future, especially the free elections promised so often in our pleas to the people. A meeting will be necessary for this.\n\nClaude Auchinleck, the leader of HMMLR who united men from every facet of society under him. Bill Alexander, the Red General who put aside his own misgivings with HMMLR to free England from fascism. David Stirling, the Mad General who never stopped fighting, no matter the cost. These men and others will determine the future of our nation."
FEN_urgent_matters_first_desc:0 "Whilst having a debate about the merits of bringing back the institution of the monarchy in a forum filled with ardent monarchists, republicans and outright communists would be fascinating, it might also take several hundred years. There are a thousand minor political differences between the assorted factions of HMMLR, but none of them matter now. We can decide on purely political problems once elections are done and the English people have chosen.\n\nFor the moment our chief goal should be repairing the damage inflicted upon our country by the Civil War, either through reckless action on our part or sadistic spite from traitor formations. There are a thousand and one matters which take place over politics, and the provisional government must be focused on those issues alone."
FEN_a_responsible_political_system_desc:0 "HMMLR is a diverse organisation, one made of promises and compromise rather than any definite political ideology. But with new elections being held members of HMMLR are in many cases the natural choices to represent or even become leaders in the new political landscape. But Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander are unwilling to lead their former followers personally, and have instead agreed to support the creation of new civilian led parties.\n\nBill Alexander seeks to draw his own old CPGB, the Labour Underground and the myriad of smaller leftist parties that made up the Left Resistance into the Socialist Labour Party. Whilst Claude Auchinleck looks to convince the establishment, liberal and former conservative party members who opposed the Collaborationist government into a National Democratic League."
FEN_the_young_democracy_law_desc:0 "Nothing is more threatening to a fledgling state than its first steps. Be it ambitious military officers or politicians seeking to make new opportunities for personal gain it is always at the beginning that a state is most vulnerable to falling from its path. Auchinleck and Alexander are well aware of this, and more importantly both are well aware of the possible consequences of any part of HMMLR trying to subvert the democratic process.\n\nThus the Young Democracy Law has been proposed, which will give authority to a select council of HMMLR veterans to, during the formative years of this resurrected democracy, suspend that democracy for the good of the English people if need be. Only with the mutual agreement of both Auchinleck and Alexander can this law be enacted, and only against a threat using the guise of democracy to end or pervert it, or the collapse of democratic institutions leaving England with good governance."
FEN_undoing_their_evils_desc:0 "England is wounded, none can deny that our land is a shattered remnant of what it once was. The Civil War caused much destruction it is true, tens of thousands of needless deaths and entire towns left broken by shells and gunfire. Yet the Collaborationist government did a great deal of damage in their rule as well, damage far harder to heal. Our academics were hunted or forced to toe the government line, the unions of workers beaten into submission or forced underground altogether. To say nothing of the political persecution of opposition parties.\n\nIt now falls to HMMLR to repair this damage, to undo what went wrong and give the people a glimmer of hope that the future we promised will be worth the wait. Be we soldiers of Stirling, Alexander or Auchinleck, we owe our countrymen that at least."
FEN_begin_demobilization_desc:0 "The struggle of liberation was one undertaken by a good many tens of thousands of loyal Englishmen. From villages and factories, dockyards and farms they came. Men and boys and even women who all knew that the evils of fascism and totalitarianism had to be expunged from our nation whatever the cost.\n\nThe top ranks have spoken and it's been agreed that now that the struggle is over, it's time for most of our men to return home. Let them trade guns for hammers and rakes and ploughshares, let them return to normalcy. A professional core of HMMLR fighters will stay on of course but they will exist to form the backbone of the future English army, not to oppress the people they are supposed to protect like the Traitor forces had done."
FEN_clearing_unexploded_ordinance_desc:0 "War's are not accurate affairs. As often as not a shell or bomb will miss its target entirely, and with significant fighting in urban and rural areas of England alike we now face the unfortunate problem of numerous explosive devices including actual landmines which, for one reason or another failed to detonate as they were intended to.\n\nUsing an all volunteer force, Claude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander have catalogued the areas with the highest number of unexploded munitions and sent demining crews in to, slowly, solve the problem. This might well take years to effect fully, and it is entirely possible that England will never be 100 percent free of explosive refuse, but it will be an improvement for our people."
FEN_life_begins_anew_desc:0 "HMMLR is a volunteer force, we had no need to conscript when the vast majority of our fighters were militiamen or defecting soldiers. Alas but being a volunteer does not insulate our soldiers from the effects of combat. Shellshock is rampant amongst those units which spent a great deal of time on the front lines, especially the militia formations which bore the brunt of much of the fighting. Many who fought for our cause lost limbs, senses and even family members when brother fought brother amidst the chaos. We owe them more than mere words can convey.\n\nWe shall do our best to ensure nobody who sacrificed something dear to their person for a Free England will be forgotten, and that those who sacrificed everything shall be remembered forever."
FEN_start_reconstruction_desc:0 "With much of the civilian leadership rendered unable to assist us due to their siding with the Collaborationist Government and what civilian apparatus we do possess mostly being limited to the more local positions, it had been decided that the reconstruction of England will take place under military authority.\n\nA series of Reconstruction Commands each covering a distinct region of England shall govern the rebuilding process, deciding on the priorities to be given for specific issues and acting as a temporary judicial and governing branch for the Provisional Government. Needless to say these will be influential positions, and whoever holds them may affect the popularity of the nascent political parties in the upcoming elections."
FEN_expand_the_reconstruction_command_desc:0 "Reconstruction is an arduous process and it falls to the Provisional Government to ensure that it gets off to a good start before whichever party wins the upcoming elections finishes it. To aid in the process, the higher ups have delegated certain military and irregular formations to each of the reconstruction zones to assist in the repair and rebuilding of infrastructure, housing and the problems associated therein.\n\nConsequently, with the Reconstruction Authorities becoming ever more influential in English society so too will the influence they hold on the future elections increase. We must take care to ensure these temporary authorities don't outstay their welcome and make provisions to dismantle them once a civilian government is available."
FEN_HMMLR_is_law_desc:0 "The police, prison and judicial systems were some of the Collaborationist Government's foremost tools to use against groups seeking the return of democracy to England, and even now we face the problem of compensating for the fact that many of their ranking members are awaiting trial for treason in one form or another.\n\nClaude Auchinleck and Bill Alexander have thus authorised for the Reconstruction Authorities to take over the duties of acting as police, internment and legal authorities until such time as all relevant systems can be reestablished. Former fighters might not make the best police, but at least we can trust that we share common cause with them."
FEN_register_the_voters_desc:0 "The coming elections will be the most important in the history of England, a return to a true and interfering democracy for the first time in over two decades. But democracy requires voters, and voter suppression was one of the main ways the Royal Party kept their traitorous grip upon power intact.\n\nAuchinleck and Alexander don't always agree on everything, but both agree that the first step to a real and functioning democracy is having as many voters as possible. To give the election a sense of legitimacy the Collaborationist government never could, and to give the ordinary Englishman a chance to show his support for our liberation. Let the light shine upon democracy unshackled, and let the traitors see exactly what it was that they feared put into action once again. The choice of the ordinary man."
FEN_feed_our_hungry_desc:0 "The Collaborationist forces had the regrettable habit of confiscating food supplies from villages and towns where they believed the populace to be against them. Combined with the food shortages from all the burnt fields and destroyed stocks of grain and if we aren't careful there might be a famine on our hands.\n\nLuckily the yanks have been generous enough to send over what aid they can, combined with generous rationing on goods in short supply and it should be enough to tide England over until the next harvest. We can use HMMLR members to hand out the rations, that ought to keep the people in good order at least. Still, some efforts to keep an eye on those in charge of rationing might not hurt."
FEN_what_of_the_young_desc:0 "Orphans are always a problem in war, no matter the conflict men and women will die and their children will be forced to face the world without them. The reprisal policies some of the fascist militias engaged in have produced many orphans, to say nothing of what happened when they shelled urban areas in efforts to root out our fighters.\n\nSadly our own victories were not free of loss either, we must take responsibility for the children of all those slain in this civil war and act to give them a better future. Orphanages and work programs for orphans leaving them will be a vital part of the post war reality in England, it is up to us to ensure they work as intended. We will also encourage adoptions where possible, to give some of them the chance of a normal life."
FEN_assume_the_civillian_administration_desc:0 "The average post office in post-civil war England is located in a wonderful neighborhood and is surrounded by a variety of pleasing aesthetics, it is also on average bombed to smithereens. It turns out that the local post office makes a frighteningly good command post for the local militia. For that matter most of the postmen are also bombed to smithereens, poor bastards were amongst the first to be conscripted.\n\nNow in regards to solving this the Reconstruction Command's have had to create and staff their own post offices, and whilst those manning them are somewhat less friendly and more inclined to prolific facial hair than the traditional postmen they are nonetheless doing their all to return England to a state of normality."
FEN_from_rifles_to_shovels_desc:0 "Whilst HMMLR has made significant use of soldiers to man previously civil affairs until normal governance has been restored, the Reconstruction Commands have only made limited use of soldiers as a rebuilding force. Still there is a first time for everything, and now it falls to the Reconstruction Command's to designate towns, cities and roads which are in need of clearing and repair.\n\nIt might be a crude solution and for certain a proper rebuilding will require years of dedicated reconstruction but as a stop gap measure this will do. Let the men and women who saved English democracy put down the weapons of war for the symbols of peace, let them enjoy their victory by having them build what is to come."
FEN_the_english_phoenix_desc:0 "The scars are still present on the English landscape and the English soul, but thanks to the Reconstruction Commands they are scars rather than open wounds. The process of healing won't be able to fully get onto its feet until the people have elect a new government, but nobody would be lying if they said the Command's did a damn good job with what they had.\n\nFrom the ashes of oppression and war a new England rises. An England without the shackles of totalitarianism, without the vultures of fascism picking at its bones. From here and forever it is a Free England which shall govern this land. Governed by the people, of the people and for the people. Not for the tyrant in Germania, and a curse upon his house. Let him know that the fire of freedom rises."
FEN_the_oxford_trials_1_desc:0 "The matter of what to do with the officials and military members of the Collaborationist regime has been a hotly debated subject. The Left Resistance, HMMLR proper and Stirling's faction all having disagreements on the fates of the accused and indeed on many groups of people as a whole.\n\nA solution as agreed to by Auchinleck, Stirling and Alexander is to hold a series of public trials for the most notorious Collaborators. So that our people and the world will know that this government is not the same as that which it replaced. That it values justice, and not mere revenge out of hand. They may be guilty to a one, but the traitors will receive a fair trial for their sins."
FEN_their_castle_burns_desc:0 "Ah the traitors, well see before they actually get to trial they're going to have to survive until the trial starts. Many people, Stirling himself included are quite annoyed that we're even having to go through with all this trial nonsense to begin with to be quite frank. Alas but the Boss and that killjoy Bill Alexander are adamant that we can't just haul them off somewhere and make the whole affair five minutes long.\n\nOf course there is some leeway over where they get held. We could go the old fashioned route and use one of the nearby castles to detain the traitors of course but if some of us were feeling ungenerous we could also hold them in an ordinary neighbourhood, close to their victims. Camouflage see, and of course if some were to go missing whilst there well, that would just be a shame."
FEN_increment_security_desc:0 "The reactionary fascists are being held in custody until such time as their crimes can be listed and evidence gathered. Also there needs to be some preparation of the trial grounds themselves in Oxford University, temporarily converted to the local headquarters for HMMLR.\n\nWe can't be seen to use soldiers at what is nominally a civilian trial so it falls to the decision of rehiring some police to act as trial guards, trustworthy ones only of course, or whether we could summon up some of our revolutionary comrades to handle security matters. We'd need to keep them in check of course but who better to ensure that the reactionaries get the justice they deserve?"
FEN_chose_the_prosecutor_desc:0 "Part of this whole civil \"justice\" stuff according to Stirling is the actual part of separating the business of who's guilty and who only looks like a filthy traitor by association. But Stirling's got word from the Boss that prosecutor is needed, and fast. We could probably find one of those types by looking around HMMLR proper, God knows they're a stuffy bunch.\n\nAlternatively, we might throw a bone to the reds. We couldn't be accused of conspiring anything if we gave the job to one of theirs but it would be an awful shame if that fellow went overboard in the charges. For the traitors that is. Or we could just ensure justice is meted out, one our lads would do the job fine i'm sure."
FEN_and_the_judge_desc:0 "As part of the general liberation of England from fascist oppression there needs to be a set precedence of fair and impartial justice to wipe away the stain of inequality riven into the heart of the reactionary system of courts. Claude Auchinleck trust comrade Alexander to deal with, and find an impartial judge to deal with the matter.\n\nA member of the Left Resistance would be ideal of course, to ensure those who hunted our fellow's like dogs back in the Uprising of 1953 get the justice in sore need of meting out, but that might open up our swiftly forming Socialist Labour Party to criticism. We could also choose a justice affiliated with HMMLR proper but they have always been somewhat squeamish. Or we could abandon even the pretense of subtly and nominate one of Stirling's men. It would get the job done at least."
FEN_enemies_of_the_nation_desc:0 "We didn't capture all the Colaborationist officials unfortunately, some are still in hiding or on the run all across England. If they flee into neighbouring countries or worse, across the Channel we may well never see them again. We cannot rely upon manhunts of ordinary soldiers no, this will require some expert help.\n\nKim Philby, one of our main agents in the Collaborationist government once upon a time and now head of the reconstituted intelligence services aims to capture the traitors by deception. Faking escape routes, using personal connections from agents he helped to defect to entrap the unwary, even outright blackmailing their families into revealing their hiding places. Or we could just send Stirling after them. That might work."
FEN_access_of_the_press_desc:0 "We really ought to consider the level of access given to the press in this whole affair. Too much of a good thing as the saying goes, if we give unrestricted access and ability to record events as they occur it could lead to some bad publicity, yet on the same grounds not allowing this could be interpreted as censorship.\n\nBill Alexander and Stirling advise that the press be limited in what they can record in some fashion, mainly to protect witnesses yet Auchinleck himself favours a more open approach. In the end a decision needs to be made and it falls to the three most powerful men in England to make it."
FEN_the_reformist_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan. The Chancellor and Under-Treasurer of His Majesty's Exchequer. And the head of the reformist wing of the Royal Party. Well known for his stance towards softening the collaborationist government and allowing a larger degree of freedom, his convictions apparently were not enough to overcome the fear of German intervention. And now, he awaits punishment for being a wartime minister in Douglas-Home's cabinet.\n\nMacmillan is not like the other prominent defendants of the cabinet, however. Unlike Home, he has never been in a position where he was responsible for the horrible crimes of the government. And unlike Chesterton, he is not a terrible and shameless individual who truly believed in the objective right of what he was doing. Perhaps that will allow him to avoid their fates. Perhaps not. We shall see..."
FEN_the_liberal_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling. By the accounts of those who knew him, he should not have joined the collaborationists at all. One of the most prominent voices against the government while in Parliament, many of similar beliefs joined HMMLR when the war broke out. Yet, he betrayed them all and stayed with the collabs. Now, he is brought before us to defend his decision.\n\nThis is easily the most controversial of the defendants we tried, however. Aside from the aforementioned break with his colleagues and friends, he hasn't done anything particularly interesting after that. Some still want to punish him. Others argue what he did does not warrant him being brought before a court for murderers and traitors at all. Let us hear the evidence before we make a final decision."
FEN_the_traitor_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery. If he had died in the invasion, he would be forever remembered as a hero. If he had refused service with the collaborators, he might still be. If he had joined with HMMLR, he would have had a chance at redemption. And yet...here he is.\n\nThe case is clear cut. He was in charge of the collaborationist army, and everything the army did could be blamed on him. However, he still has conducted actions in his past that were admirable, and there remains a not-insignificant amount of respect for him amongst Claude and his supporters. Might it be worth it to temper justice with mercy?"
FEN_the_rabid_dogs_desc:0 "Templer. Carver. Gibbs. Baker. Their names are numerous, but there is one thing that unites them all. They were commissioned generals in the collaborationist army. And now, we have to judge them for the atrocities committed under their commands.\n\nThey have no future in our army, that much is clear. But how far do we want to punish them? Some are arguing that only blood can answer for blood, but others are arguing that a violent retaliation against these men is not who we are, and that more proportionate punishments should be considered."
FEN_the_head_of_the_snake_desc:0 "Alec Douglas-Home. The longest serving Prime Minister in the history of collaborationist England. But while his electoral strength still remains undefeated, his tenure was ended by the free peoples he had tried to submit. Now, we shall bring him before the court to defend himself.\n\nHe is accused of every injustice, every violation, every misery suffered by the English people during this war. Every order, every action, every inaction can be traced to him and him alone. We intend to make him answer for every one of those crimes. And prosecute the leader of the collaborationists to the fullest extent for the crimes committed under his command."
FEN_the_bootlicker_desc:0 "Arthur Chesterton. If there was a man more reviled in all of England, hated by both rebels and collaborators alike, we have yet to find him. A fascist demagogue so low he could walk under a dachshund's belly, the head of the collaborationist secret police, and the head of a Blackshirt paramilitary group during the war. Certainly, he has an enormous amount to answer for, though we will try to be fair to him. As fair as one can be when looking at an individual as heinous as Chesterton is."
FEN_the_gavel_strikes_desc:0 "It is done, the Oxford trials have concluded and now we merely await the sentence. Throughout these trials we have seen the very worst the Collaborationist Government and its military dogs had to offer. We have heard tell of countless crimes and even more horrific goings on in the dark underbelly of the Collaborationist Regime, but the sentence shall apportion guilt only to those deserving.\n\nOur actions beforehand could well have affected the outcome significantly, we can only hope that the international community sees the trials as just or at least fair. If not, we may have made a miscalculation."
FEN_citizenship_reborn_desc:0 "One man one vote, though now that women can vote as well the saying might need to be updated somewhat. One person one vote doesn't quite run off the tongue so well. Either way, the National Democratic League and the Socialist Labour Party now prepare to face off in the first demcoratic election held on English soil in two decades.\n\nAt stake is the future of the monarchy, the economy and the reconstruction process. As well the assorted reforms each party says they will or won't enact. But it shan't be some shady council of military men who decide how this happens, it shall be the people. And the people alone. This is what we fought for, a free and independent England. Let us enjoy it whilst we can."
FEN_corner_stone_democracy_desc:0 "For years, England was the main force behind freedom and democracy throughout the globe. The entire might of our nation ensured the world would always stand against despots and would-be world conquerors. But today, our system is broken, and England is controlled by an emergency military dictatorship. We must restore democracy as soon as possible to make good on our promises to the population, and to show we really are going to create a free and democratic England."
FEN_Guiding_hand_desc:0 "Every revolution has its heroes. Ones who risked their lives and freedom to create a better world. But now the revolution is over. And what role should those heroes take now?\n\nBill Alexander, Claude Auchinleck, and David Stirling have all certainly done their parts in this battle. But the next phase is approaching, and they certainly don't wish to stick around too long and overstay their welcome. They will meet to decide how best to use their status in order to aid the revolution."
FEN_Restoring_Trust_desc:0 "Years of being governed by a supposed democracy that disenfranchised the majority of the population and ruthlessly targeted any dissident has left the population extremely jaded about Democracy. The general triumph of dictators over the democratic nations has also left people a bit pessimistic about our government. We'll tell them exactly why that's wrong.\n\nWhat we experienced was merely a Reichskommissariat with a facade thrown over to try and give it an air of legitimacy. Our government will be a true democracy, and will not make the mistakes as the ones in the past."
FEN_from_ash_desc:0 "Rivers clogged with the remains of bridges. Shells of factories being lived in by hundreds of homeless people. Vast fields of burnt wheat, trampled on by men and machines. Block after block of collapsed brick piles where homes once stood. Bombs and unexploded shells being discovered every day. England is a land destroyed, a land broken beyond use. But we shall rebuild it. To make the England one remembers, and to make an England that will lead one into the future."
FEN_To_Roads_desc:0 "England has long known the importance of solid infrastructure. The Romans laid solid, paved roads that we still use today. Our canals made us an industrial power, and our railroads brought much of the world into a more enlightened age. Now, we are mired in poverty, and our roads are destroyed. One may draw a conclusion from this.\n\nEngland's roads will be rebuilt. Broad highways will link our nation together. Trucks and cars will have smooth, well built paths to any area they wish to go. And with the proper framework in place, we can begin our industrial reconstruction."
FEN_Rebuilding_the_System_desc:0 "England's economy does not work. In fact, it hasn't worked for many years. Many of it is merely the result of massive destruction and carnage from the two massive wars on the island. But there are a few things that just don't work, and we'll be prepared to replace all of it. Taxes, regulations, jobs, industries, everything will be rebuilt. And if we know that it won't work, we'll reform it and put in something that will. England will be prosperous again, and we're going to do anything to make that happen."
FEN_To_The_People_desc:0 "One must not forget why we're doing all this. Not for some narcissistic desire to have our nation achieve some arbitrary definition of \"greatness\". Not for the sole wish to have the collabs and traitors suffer. We are doing this for the people of England. They do not deserve what was inflicted upon them by the Germans and their Quisling lackeys. They deserve to have the say in how things are done, and they deserve to have a decent and happy life. We will remember this, and make it clear where our priorities lie."
FEN_Bread_and_What_desc:0 "At long last, the hunger plaguing the nation is beginning to subside. Our efforts have been successful, and we soon won't have a problem like that anymore. So what do we put our efforts into with the leftover cash?\n\nWelfare is a good option, since many still have other issues aside from hunger. A strong democratic system would require some extra cash as well. Or we could just spend it on the army and ensure another humiliation like this will not happen again."
FEN_To_The_Army_desc:0 "Our military accomplished what it set out to do. It defeated the collaborators and set in place a new system of government that will help the people of England. But in its new role? It is not as adept as it should be. It must be reformed, and we will begin to make the necessary decisions to shape the military in the way we want."
FEN_where_to_send_the_rest_desc:0 "The army has thousands of extra soldiers. Regulars, local militias, and reservist groups. Some say this is too much. They say they could be doing much more useful work in other places. Things like rebuilding our nation, repairing factories, repaving roads, that sort of thing. This is an interesting proposal, and we have to consider the possibility that our forces could be more effectively utilized in other ways."

ENG_an_unfortunate_reality_desc:0 "Since we are now a part of the OFN, we can no longer entice German investment and support. We must embrace them, we have simply become too dependent on the US. The Germans are not willing to come anywhere near us.\n\nEven Thatcher has allowed her hopes to subside. Britain can no longer be a Superpower, we will have to accept that we now exist in the shadow of the USA. At least we are free of the Germans."
ENG_the_road_to_washington_desc:0 "America's dominance over the United Kingdom has now been accepted, Thatcher has decided to send Pym on a diplomatic mission to Wasington to talk to the Americans about our new relationship. Our embassy there will need to be expanded as relations with the Americans become more intimate. It has become obvious that Britain is no longer entirely in control of its relations with the United States."
ENG_share_our_technology_desc:0 "Technology is to become an important base for our new relationship with the United States. Regrettably we will have to send some of our technical developments to them in return, since we are no longer in the position we once were. However, the additional improvements to our Industry and Jets will be welcome. Perhaps American dominance will not be all that bad."
ENG_an_ofn-sided_trade_deal_desc:0 "With the Germans out of the picture the US knows we no longer have any leverage over them. Losing the protections that we had in the past will be very damaging to our government's reputation, but we will have to swallow our pride as the country desperately needs a trade deal with the Americans. We no longer have a say in such matters. Sadly, we are going to give up several concessions to preserve our economy."
ENG_bases_on_britain_desc:0 "We will allow the Americans to set up military bases on British soil, their army will now help protect our shores from German forces.\n\nThis is exactly what the Germans have always feared would happen, they will be put right on edge once this news reaches their leadership. They will likely see the Americans as a grave threat and will want to retaliate in a way they can.\n\nAt least the Americans are here to protect us now."
ENG_americas_airstrip_desc:0 "The United States is keen to position its air force on our island, the proximity of our bases to Germany will be very advantageous to the American military. They will have the access they require, we will serve them; becoming their unsinkable aircraft carrier.\n\nThere is nothing for us to gain from this besides US protection. We can only wish that they will see us as an intimate ally; rather than nothing more than an airstrip."

England is back under the German sphere of influence and our government is likely to be diminished to little more than the puppet that it was before the war.

ENG_a_line_on_the_north_sea_desc:0 "A new maritime border with Germany will have to be drawn. Concessions will have to be made to the Germans and they will not be concerned with how their might affect us. There is no doubt that we will lose most of our access to the North Sea; along with most of its resources and wealth. We have to hope that everything we surrender to the Germans will satisfy them in the future."
ENG_surrender_the_oil_desc:0 "Sadly the oil under the North Sea will have to be part of our concession to the Germans. We have little choice but to give the Germans almost exclusive drilling access within the region. We will lose almost all of our oil fields and our economy will suffer as a result.\n\nThis choice is taken because it is a necessity, if we did not give the oil to them they would just take it, this way it is on our terms."
ENG_north_sea_naval_exercises_desc:0 "The Germans have become increasingly enthusiastic for the Royal Navy and the Kreigsmarine to take part in a joint exercise in the North Sea. The war games will take place shortly, it will likely be odd for our sailors to train alongside the Germans they have prepared to fight against not too long ago. But this will just have to be a part of their encroaching influence into our military."
ENG_give_them_access_to_scapa_flow_desc:0 "Scapa Flow is believed to be one of the greatest naval bases on earth, it has been a source of great pride for the Royal Navy ever since it became a base for the British Grand Fleet. But our navy has long since been sunk to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe port will now have to be relinquished to the Germans, they will get more use of it than we would have; they still have a powerful navy after all.\n\nYet another concession has to be made to the Germans, each one is sad, but necessary."
ENG_a_dream_forever_crushed_desc:0 "There was a time, not too long ago, when we thought it would be possible for England to rid the British Isles of German influence. Alas this was not meant to be, the Hun have returned to reassert their control over us. England is back where it started, under the German thumb. Britain will never become a superpower, let alone great, under Thatcher. Our government will not even be sovereign, we have lost everything and are set to gain pitifully little.\n\nIt seems as if England is doomed to live under the Germans for many more painful years."
ENG_bedfellows_with_the_devil_desc:0 "England is back under the control of the Germans, we have allowed them to have far too much influence. The United States no longer wishes to deal with us, our only option that we have left is to join them. This situation has become far from ideal, but at least with Germany under Speer, Britain may yet retain a degree of its own sovereignty.\n\nHowever England will now only become a shadow of what it could have been."
ENG_relax_trade_barriers_desc:0 "Numerous barriers to trade between Great Britain and Germany still exist; the German have requested that they be cut down as quickly as possible. Many tariffs and embargoes are to be lifted, without them conducting business between our two nations will become much easier. The immediate effects of this may benefit them more than it helps us, but it could very well assist our economy in the long run."
ENG_reject_the_ultimate_humiliation_desc:0 "Lately the Germans have set up a Pan European economic project known as the 'Zollverein'. This is nothing short of economic imperialism, created by the Germans as a tool to exploit the resources of the other members of the project.\n\nGreat Britain has absolutely no intentions of joining such a thing. Thatcher has already been distrustful of the continentals and despite her weakened position will never allow the Germans to ravage her country. There is no doubt that we will reject joining this, showing that we clearly still hold on to a shred of our former dignity."
ENG_the_germans_in_london_desc:0 "A new ambassador is to be sent to London from Germania, he will likely be stationed in a place where he can keep an eye on our government. Thatcher is to meet with the ambassador, even if she is reluctant to do so. The Prime Minister is also expected to congratulate him on the beginning of a new era of Anglo-German relations.\n\nIt is not going to be an era that will see the rise of Britain, the time and for that has been and gone; we will have to work if what we have from here on out."
ENG_german_technicians_desc:0 "Germany is to send over a group of technicians to help modernise our ineffectual industry, which still suffers from the damage of the Civil War. They will be welcomed, because even though they may be Germans, we can still use their expertise. Our factories need the support and we will appreciate their help in getting our economy back on its feet."
ENG_partners_with_the_hun_desc:0 "We are not subservient to the Germans. At least not as much as the rest of Europe, we are considered to be closer to partners than puppets. They may be many times more powerful than we are, but some still like to think that we continue to hold our own against the Europeans.\n\nHowever our economy is still dependent on their support. It is highly unlikely that we will ever be completely free of German influence."
ENG_the_welsh_issue_desc:0 "The simple fact that Wales is separate from the rest of England undermines our government in the eyes of the rest of the world. The government there has set up an illegitimate that has no reason to exist; therefore it must be brought back under the control of Westminster. We will deal with them swiftly and resolutely. They will not block us from reclaiming our right to greatness"
ENG_mobilize_the_reserves_desc:0 "Even though Wales is a small minor power, with a small minor military protecting it, we will still need more manpower in order to overwhelm them. Mobilizing our reserves will let us have enough troops to defeat the Welsh scourge. It may be an overly extreme move, but we can not let them have a chance at defeating us, or we will be humiliated for the rest of history."
ENG_a_show_of_force_desc:0 "Before we cross the border into Wales to reassume control over their territory, we will demonstrate our military might to their faces. Every Welsh Border Guard will hear the echoes of our artillery that will shortly be turned on them. Having flexed our armies muscles there will be no doubt in their minds of what will come next. We will attack rapidly and they will be too scared to even lift a finger to defend themselves."
ENG_increase_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 "As we are starting to become more connected internationally we will need to expand the size of our Foreign Ministry. More diplomats are required to negotiate overseas on the government's behalf, this will lay sufficient groundwork for future diplomatic actions. After Wales has been dealt with, we will be able to make sure our international presence is felt."
ENG_expand_the_foreign_ministry_desc:0 ""
ENG_solve_the_welsh_issue_desc:0 "We have already made all the necessary preparations for an invasion of Wales, our army stands ready at the border and ready for battle. Now it is the time to negotiate with the Welsh where we will mercifully offer them a peaceful solution to their treachery.\n\nIf they dare to refuse us then they will get what they deserve."
ENG_the_south_united_desc:0 "The first confrontation in the reunification of our isle has been won, as Wales has been conquered. The English people have become reinvigorated by the government's success and are ardently waiting for our next triumph. There is much work left to be done but Thatcher will doubtlessly make sure that it is done.\n\nLong live England, soon to be the United Kingdom."
ENG_the_fortress_up_north_desc:0 "There is one last obstacle in the way of restoring the United Kingdom, it is our ancient rival, Scotland. If our dealings with Wales is anything to go by, they should fall under our authority soon.\n\nHowever they will prove to be quite an indomitable foe. They have spent years apprehensively preparing to defend their republic. The border is heavily fortified, if no peaceful settlement is found, the resulting war will be the bloodiest in the history of the British Isles."
ENG_contact_pro-unionist_officers_desc:0 "In spite of the Scottish government's vigorous efforts to defend their nation, they have overlooked the swathes of pro-unionist soldiers that existed amidst their armies ranks. Once they have been contacted by MI6, they will be very useful in bringing down the Republic from within. And if the Scotish government refuses to reunify diplomatically, they will explode every fort, every road and every government office that they can. We will make it clear that Scottish security is nothing more than an illusion, their territory will be reintegrated, by any means necessary."
ENG_mountain_warfare_desc:0 "If we are forced into a war we will have to stamp out every Scottish nationalist throughout the land. That will include the rugged, and easily defensible, mountains of the north.\n\nAt the moment, our army is not prepared to fight in such terrain. They will have to be trained to fight amongst the mountains if we are to have a hope of removing the Scottish army entirely."
ENG_we_are_willing_to_negotiate_desc:0 "We do not wish to fight with the people of Scotland. They are almost as ready as we are for war. The battle along the border would be bloody, the havoc inside the cities would be terrifying and the scars that would be left behind would take several lifetimes to fade.\n\nBut, rest assured, they know that we are more than willing to make such sacrifices to restore our once United Kingdom."
ENG_the_welsh_example_desc:0 "Wales has already been retaken and brought back to its proper place within our kingdom and we have gained a great deal of experience from dealing with them. We are ready to use these experiences to better tackle the Scots. Our army is more than willing to occupy them. There will be no time wasted in reuniting with Scotland under the crown."
ENG_bridge_the_gap_desc:0 "Reunification with Scotland is imperative if we are to regain our national prestige, the sooner we start work on their unification, the better. They may be hostile toward us to begin with, but they will quickly learn that we are not going to submit to their demands. The Scots will not remain independent much longer. Scotland has to be reintegrated, no matter the cost."
ENG_the_second_act_of_union_desc:0 "Having dealt with the old government of the Scottish Republic and the Welsh brakeaway, we can begin drafting our proclamation of the reunification of the United Kingdom. Our isle is no longer divided. We are once more united under one king and Margret Thatcher's dream of England once again being relevant on the world stage is closer than ever to being fulfilled, now that she rules Britannia."
ENG_a_necessity_desc:0 "Ever since Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of England, she has had one fundamental goal, the restoration of what she believes is England's rightful place on the world stage. In order to take up this mantle, she believes that Great Britain must first be reunited; this will only be possible with Pakt or OFN assistance. However, before Thatcher can begin to take a more active role in foreign policy she will have to meet with Francis Pym.\n\nDespite being fiercely loyal to her prime ministership, Pym is unlikely to appreciate what he believes is Thatcher's increasingly excessive control of his area of policy."
ENG_our_biggest_threat_desc:0 "Following on from her previous talks with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Thatcher has planned to persuade Pym that the presence of the Cornwall Garrison on English soil is unacceptable.\n\nThe mere existence of the garrison is indeed a grave and constant threat to the future sovereignty of England. If Thatcher is to restore England's independence, she will have to rid herself of the Germans who occupy the isle."
ENG_approaching_the_hun_desc:0 "With Pym sufficiently convinced of the merits of Thatcher's plan, the time has come for him and the Prime Minister to visit Germania together. After their arrival in the German capital, they will have to come to many agreements with the Germans, from trade to future military relations.\n\nA peaceful resolution has already been made with Germany over Cornwall, although tensions still hang over the two countries. These negotiations will not be easy, but they will be essential in placating the Germans."
ENG_visiting_an_old_friend_desc:0 "After the Second World War broke out the United States abandoned England, and doomed us to our German dominated fate. Since then we have constantly avoided reaching out to the Americans, we did not feel like we could truly trust them.\n\nYet the Anglo-American relationship has not always been this cold, after all, we did fight side by side during World War One. By ushering in a new age of Anglo-American friendship and mutual assistance, we will be able to stand taller than ever on the world stage."
ENG_a_place_in_germania_desc:0 "Soon England will be able to send an envoy into Germania to establish a stronger relationship with Germany. This will bring the United Kingdom closer to Germany and solidify its place as their equal, and not as their puppet.\n\nHowever, the choice of ambassador remains to be made. Thatcher will want to push for a more hardline candidate who will not bend to German pressure, but Pym will likely prefer to appoint the ambassador himself. The strain between the two is bound to become much more noticeable."
ENG_what_our_future_shall_hold_desc:0 "Relations with the Germans are still somewhat hostile. We will have to tread carefully if we are to avoid wrecking the progress our two countries have already made. A treaty will have to be signed to help normalize our new relationship. Assuring non-aggression will also be a significant step towards greater cooperation.\n\nHowever much we may distrust them we must remember that they need us as much as we need them."
ENG_we_are_not_afraid_desc:0 "Many years have passed since we were humbled by Germany and forced to suffer underneath them for decades. Thankfully this humiliating part of our past has been left behind, we no longer live in fear of the Cornwall Garrison and stand eye to eye with the Germans.\n\nAt long last England stands independent, and no matter what, it will not be easy for Germany to take that away from us again."
ENG_a_black_or_blue_telephone_desc:0 "Direct communication is a key part of securing long term close relations between states in our increasingly modern age. However, the question remains over which country we should establish this meaningful connection with.\n\nSetting up a telephone line with the US administration would allow our country to cooperate much more closely with the OFN. Helping to cement our trust with those who are part of the free world.\n\nOn the other hand, reestablishing a direct means of talking with the German leadership would help us to reconcile with them.\n\nWhichever side we choose will have much more influence over us"
ENG_german_technical_support_desc:0 "If we were to receive German technical support our industry would be strengthened a great deal. Taking advantage of their support would offer significant improvements to the effectiveness of English industrial production. This move may bring us closer to the Germans, but our country would benefit hugely, regardless of the dangers."
ENG_german_technology_desc:0 "There are many within our government who may still distrust the Germans, but that does not detract from the fact that their technology is some of the best in the world. Their superior tanks and advanced planes are thought to be the main reasons why they triumphed in the Second World War. Although this may just be trumped up German propaganda, our military sorely needs the technological support that Germany is willing to offer."
ENG_american_technical_support_desc:0 "One of the main advantages of using American support is the fact that it is not German. As we still have issues with the Germans it would be better for us to request the support of the US instead. We will nevertheless become more reliant on the Americans, which will set a dangerous president if we wish to continue to remain entirely independent. However we will have to make a choice and many would rather avoid the devil we already know, all too well."
ENG_american_technology_desc:0 "There is no air force on the planet that can be compared to the American's; the United States has the most futuristic fighter jets and helicopters at its disposal. Their modern style of warfare is also very intriguing, even though it is not known if it is totally reliable. If we were to have some of these aircraft in our own air force, the German military would be as fearsome as it currently seems"
ENG_overlooking_washington_desc:0 "Having sown the seeds of our new relationship with the Americans, the time has come for an English ambassador to be sent to Washington. This will mark the first time the US and England have worked together in decades; it may only be an ambassador but it signifies that times are indeed changing. Once the bond with America has been rekindled, England will not be as alone in the world as it has been."
ENG_a_new_special_relationship_desc:0 "Over the course of history, the US and the UK have always been close; sharing a common language and a similar cultural identity. The Prime Minister now seeks to use these similarities to create a new partnership with America, one that suitably reflects the intimacy of our pasts. However Thatcher is unlikely to permit any deal to be too in favor of the US, she would much prefer England to remain in control of its own destiny."
ENG_the_germanian_problem_desc:0 "England may have released herself from Germany's clutches, but we are not completely free. Germany's military power is still immense and if the German leadership were to order another invasion, there would be little we could do to stop them.\n\nHowever, if we had an ally that was willing and able to protect us, the people of England would sleep much more soundly. We will need to turn to the United States and guarantee their military support, for the sake of the safety of England."
ENG_german_military_advisors_desc:0 "In its present state, the English Army is far too undertrained to face the challenges of modern warfare, we will need to seek the help of the Germans if this is to change. Because of the Germans success during the war, their military advisors have been proven to be highly skilled. Employing them within our army will bring us up to date and make reuniting our isle by force a lot more plausible."
ENG_no_military_advisors_desc:0 "Even though our military is known to be undertrained, over reliance on either the Americans or the Germans is something that is critical for us to avoid. It would only diminish England to nothing more than pawn to be used by either superpower. Refusing advisors from both sides will weaken our own military but it will help us to run a self sufficient army, free from foreign interference.\n\nWe can not allow any other country to know how we intend to wage war; our army, like the rest of our country, will remain independent."
ENG_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "In its present state, the English Army is far too undertrained to face the challenges of modern warfare, we will need to seek the help of American military advisors if this is to change. They will equip our forces with the skills necessary to defend our shores against any German threat. This would bring us much closer to the United States, though be that as it may we need help and we will be damned if we turn to the Germans."
ENG_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that Wales is back under our control our military and our government appear a lot stronger than they did before. We can now turn our attention on to more relevant parts of the world. Thatcher is one step closer to reuniting the isle.\n\nEngland is now ready to begin retaking its proper position on the international scene."
ENG_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc:0 "The current position of the United Kingdom is still a precarious one, however it could also be highly profitable. Thatcher believes that it is possible for the UK to leverage its power between Germany and the United States, to get them to sign deals favorable to England. Pym will need to be won over before we can start the delicate tasks that will enable us to use our current position to its greatest extent."
ENG_preparing_for_the_enemy_desc:0 "Thatcher is keen for the army to show its strength in a wargame, warding off any prospective invaders. The question remains, who should be the focus of our display, both sides could be threats in the future. Either Way the choice that is made will need to be calculated, neither the Americans nor the Germans have our interests at heart.\n\nWe will have to remind both of them of our independence; along with our willingness to defend it."
ENG_discuss_the_enemy_desc:0 "Now that we have chosen who the main threat to the United Kingdom is, we can start to draw up plans over what strategies they are likely to use if they were to invade us. From there we will figure out how we should counteract their attacks. There can be no chance of the enemy ever taking control of our country. We will never be subjugated again."
ENG_grab_some_blueprints_desc:0 "Though we may be working with them now, there is no guarantee to how long this relationship may continue, yet there is still plenty that we would like to get out of our temporary ally. They have several blueprints that we would like to borrow and since they will not be willing to hand them over for free, we will have to steal them. Fortunately for us, MI6 is quite adept at capturing such material, they will work with Thatcher to secure the designs that will considerably improve our technology."
ENG_study_the_results_desc:0 "The Royal Army has exerted itself tremendously and provided us with some valuable data on how our opponent is likely to handle itself in battle. We will need to assess this data and use it to our advantage, should we ever have to face them in an actual war. Though there is still hope that the UK will never have to wage war again, we have become more ready than ever to defend our United Kingdom."
ENG_a_conference_in_dover_desc:0 "Foreign investment is what is going to enrich the people of England, and with two superpowers striving to trump the other, we will become very rich indeed. And to maximise our profits, Thatcher has already come up with a plan to auction off a contract that would grant extra access to the workers of the UK. She will have to continue to guide Pym to make it certain that the country continues to play the two sides off against each other.\n\nOur international course has been chartered, now is the time for us on our journey toward economic rejuvenation."
ENG_the_promise_of_free_enterprise_desc:0 "If we are to attract more investment into the UK, we will have to assure foreign companies that whichever super power they will be able to invest freely in our markets, without the government interfering. Even though this would help we still want to maintain control of our economy; however Thatcher believes there is a way we can get the best of both worlds. She will allude to free enterprise, but never fully commit to it, using the power of plausible deniability we will raise more and more investment."
ENG_hint_at_the_scottish_oil_desc:0 "As a result of our reunification with Scotland, many sizable oil fields in the North Sea have come under our control. This has certainly caught the attention of foreign firms who are eager to exploit our resources.\n\nThatcher has planned to make a "slipup" in her next speech where she will mention the possibility of investors gaining access to UK oil; raising the stakes and our economy higher and higher."
ENG_redistribute_the_money_desc:0 "In the wake of the civil war, England was in ruin. Thatcher has since helped the country rebuild, expand and reunify the United Kingdom. But despite all this, the English people have remained poor.\n\nThe auction of 'the contract' has left a lot of money in the hands of the government. It is enough to help fund an expansion in state education and welfare; this would make the populace a good deal more satisfied with Thatcher's leadership."
ENG_upsell_a_trade_deal_desc:0 "It is such a great shame that we will only be able to trade with either America or Germany. Which is a sad reality as we could have profited greatly from trading with two superpowers.\n\nRather than making the decision of who we shall open our markets to ourselves, we will make them bid for it. We trust that this trade deal will be highly sought after and that as a result, we will make a great deal of money from selling it."
ENG_the_value_of_the_english_market_desc:0 "England has large reserves of steel and coal, as well as very good potential to have a large amount of industrial output. As bidding has begun for the trade deal, we should remind both sides of these immense benefits; as well as how It would be an awful shame if the other side were to get access to it and they were to lose out. They will raise their bids and we will only profit more."
ENG_raise_the_stakes_desc:0 "Thus far the bids for the trade deal have been decent; but they could be higher.\n\nWe already know that both sides are desperate to prevent fiercely trying to curb the power of the other. By "hinting" at the possibility of access to British ports being a part of the trade deal, both sides will take the auction a lot more seriously. They will not want to allow the other such a strategic base in such a crucial region.\n\nThey will need to win this now."
ENG_our_proficiency_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but the United Kingdom is back on the world stage, and what an entrance we have made. After all, we have just managed to tactfully outmanoeuvre two global superpowers with ease.\n\nPrestige has returned to England and everyone in the country is better for it, from the elites to the workers. Thatcher has succeeded in solidifying our independence and warding of all foreign influences. Our position is once again safe and secure."
ENG_reveal_our_motive_desc:0 "The reunification of the United Kingdom and our outwitting of Germany and the United States has left us in good stead internationally. Thatcher believes that we should go one step further and declare Britain to be the 5th Superpower.\n\nBoth the Germans and Americans will not be best pleased with this announcement, but it is necessary if Britain is to return to its righteous place and stand shoulder to shoulder, eye to eye with the rest of the world."
ENG_a_great_britain_desc:0 "In spite of all obstacles, Thatcher has done it; Great Britain is resurgent.\n\nThough many doubted we would ever recover from our greatest defeat and subsequent German subjugation, we have. Wales and Scotland have been reunified with England and the German presence in Cornwall has been dislodged. We can now stand free of their influence.\n\nA new era has begun for our country, we are now ready to compete with the rest of the world again. Let us hope that our power continues to rise; so that the world can once again realise the power of Great Britain."

ENG_united_england_wins_desc:0 "It would seem the Royal Party have fallen far from their glory days indeed, for despite every foul attempt at deceit thrown our way it is not Margaret Thatcher who won the elections. For two decades a Royal Party member was PM, but those days are over, for it was United England who won the elections!\n\nUnder the leadership of the new Prime Minister Reginald Maudling, a noted liberal and Party Chairman Harold Macmillan United England shall bring the nation the reforms it requires to survive in an ever changing world. The gross corruption and nepotism of the Royal Party will not be tolerated, we will reform England root and stem into a nation our children will be proud to call home."
ENG_but_inside_its_as_divided_as_ever_desc:0 "United England is unfortunately not a single party, but rather it is an amalgamation of two distinct groups who were both dissatisfied with the status quo under the Royal Party. First are the Liberals who nominally lead United England, the furthest left allowed under Royal Party rule the Liberals desire a return to the glory days of English democracy when every man had his vote and he didn't have only one option to vote for.\n\nBy contrast, the current majority of the party aren't loyal to the Liberal ideal so much as they are to the person of Party Chairman Harold Macmillan. Above all else, Macmillan desires the utter obliteration of fascism in England, but whether he can continue to work with the Liberals to do so is still the question."
ENG_meet_the_chairman_desc:0 "Some of the more stupid call Harold Macmillan a coward for being one of the architects of the English surrender. Those men are fools, the Party Chairman acted as he did not because he wished for the current situation to arise but because the alternative was seeing England bombed into oblivion and its youth slaughtered in pointless battles for petty politics.\n\nHarold Macmillan will do anything to see that never comes to pass again, but whilst he has influence over United England he also wouldn't mind some revenge against those who used the capitulation of England to their own advantage to acquire wealth and power. The former Royal Party may have been his allies, but they were never his friends. Perhaps things can be different with Maudling."
ENG_meet_the_PM_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling has long been a firebrand Liberal in English politics. Protected as he was by the influence of the reformist faction of the Royal Party, Maudling was one of the more vocal government critics and his image stuck in the minds of the people for this. Perhaps then it was no surprise that nobody else could lead a party seeking to restore England's glory days. Macmillan might have the majority of the party on his side but he does need Maudling for the moment.\n\nStill, should Maudling secure his position as Prime Minister he would institute the reforms promised and more. For when you look across England, there is nobody else who has the ability whilst also being acceptable to the current establishment."
ENG_parliament_opens_desc:0 "Elections are always times of great reflection for the political classes. Knowing that your constituents saw fit to elect you despite whatever dirt your opponent threw your way is certainly a great morale booster for the newly elected and old guard alike.\n\nThis opening of Parliament however looks to be more interesting than most, as the two most important men in United England talk of their visions for the nation's future. Harold Macmillan the Party Chairman looks set to aggrandise his vision of an England secure from the threat of fascism and corruption, whilst PM Reginald Maudling seems likely to adress the matters of the flaws in the current democratic system and his solutions. Whom the party shall pay more attention to, however, is not certain."
ENG_inside_westminister_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan and Reginald Maudling are critical members of the leadership of the United England party, but their increasingly divergent political views are causing... issues. Macmillan's position that government guidance remains paramount for defending democracy and Maudling's Shakespearean insistence that liberty not be sacrificed in the name of stability are increasingly pulling the party into two different camps. Westminster is not large enough for the egos of these two men to coexist; the party will have to choose one or the other."
ENG_to_protect_england_desc:0 "In times of crisis it is not the idealists we look to for comfort. Men are not comforted by pretty words, nor are they comforted by ideals. It is action and experience which keeps the people calm and focused upon their own lives, the knowledge that they will not have to do anything, for the experts will take care of the problem. That is what Harold Macmillan offers England.\n\nWhen the liberal elements of our party buckle, Harold Macmillan will stand fast. Should the skies darken with approaching aircraft the people will be able to retreat to prebuilt shelters rather than their basements. Should the wolves at our door come knocking they will not find weakness in England, for Macmillan will sacrifice anything and everything for the protection of our people. Nothing else is acceptable."
ENG_here_we_go_again_desc:0 "More than thirty years of political experience have made Harold Macmillan into a master of the parliamentary battlegrounds. Working from behind the scenes, the man in the background ensured that the Royal Party didn't grow too abusive in their pursuit of power whilst keeping the Germans minds as far from England as possible.\n\nNow Macmillan is in much the same situation, the vital pillar on which PM Maudling's support rests, ensuring that United England works in a smooth and efficient manner in regards to government whilst keeping the National Front and relict Royal Party disorganised. Helped by the fact that much of United England is loyal to him personally, Macmillan will keep our nation on a steady course."
ENG_look_over_the_floor_desc:0 "The English \"opposition\" is the single biggest collection of liars, frauds and criminals that have ever had the dishonour to sit in parliament. In the Royal Party are the corrupt, the arrogant sellouts who if they had their way would have us still answering to Germany in full. Far from their once lofty heights, the Royal Party is a disgraceful institution that ought be put to rest.\n\nThen we have the National Front. Mere words cannot describe the hatred United England has for those disgusting, wretched, feculent pieces of refuse. Worse than wanting out subordination to the Reich, worse even than the thousands they betrayed to Germany is their true allegiance. Fascism. If we have to fight for a thousand years to ensure the National Front never gain power, it will be a thousand well spent."
ENG_the_corrupt_and_the_fash_have_to_go_desc:0 "United England is now England's only hope for salvation from the forces of fascism and corruption. If either of our opposition parties were ever to gain power it would be a disaster without comparison, so venal and debased are their flaws. Luckily, the Party Chairman has a plan he will outline to Prime Minister Maudling.\n\nThe corruption and disloyalty of our opposition comes with certain advantages, namely that were United England to answer public calls for the investigation of corruption within parliament we would catch a far greater number of MP's with loyalties to the National Front and Royal Party than we would our own supporters. We can even investigate and search for evidence ourselves, for who knows the secrets of our former friends better than Macmillan?"
ENG_the_anti_corruption_act_desc:0 "Corruption is a disease that affects politicians like lice. A little isn't really an issue worth dealing with, a moderate amount might require some care to stamp out. When faced with an infestation, only fumigation will solve our problem.\n\nThe Anti Corruption Act is a bill drafted by Mr Macmillan and other concerned MP's of United England to outline some clear expectations on what the newly reformed England expects of its political classes, with some severe penalties for gross levels of corruption and a dedicated watchdog organisation to to catch the more unwise MP's in the act. Oh, the Royal Party and the National Front will howl and complain no doubt, but it is us, not them who are in power now. The public will love us even more for this."
ENG_the_back_bench_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberal faction of United England have always been the second in charge for a reason, namely that the those loyal to Macmillan outnumber them by a not insignificant amount. Yet, their ideals of a truly restored democracy and extensive social reform aren't inherently terrible, and their support is useful. It's why we don't treat them like we do the fascists, after all.\n\nLed by the current Prime Minister Mr Maudling, they might not be equal partners in our current alliance of United England, but they are partners nonetheless, and we ought to be careful that we don't alienate them unnecessarily. They are members of Parliament after all, and even one or two sunken bills could be a detriment to the vision of the Party Chairman. So we shall let them be."
ENG_talk_with_maudling_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling's heart is in the right place - the restoration of democracy, of English liberties and responsible, responsive government - but he misses the forest for the trees. With the dogs baying across the Channel and... disorderly elements still a threat at home, we have to make sure that England is safe for democracy before all else. We need to convince Maudling to see things our way."
ENG_promise_them_acts_and_them_over_desc:0 "You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. How that old saying relates to our current situation is that we really do need to make some surface level appeals to the more Liberal members of United England to keep them on the same train of thought. We will throw them a few bones to keep them happy, as it were.\n\nThe easiest way to keep them happy would be to introduce some more \"liberal\" acts into our legislative agenda, all the usually hot air about the inherent rights of the people and free expression and whatnot. Perhaps even some pardons for a few political prisoners thrown in with it. We should probably take care to ensure we don't release any fascists, though."
ENG_the_better_education_act_desc:0 "One thing both the Macmillanist and Liberal factions of United England most assuredly agree on is that the state of our education system is simply abysmal. The Royal Party truly was the party of the elite, having neglected the common people so thoroughly that they even defunded countless public schools. Truly, the fact that this is even an issue highlights the pitiful nature of our current situation.\n\nThe Better Education Act is a bill which will attempt to reform the education system into something responsible to the wants and needs of students, rather than fruitlessly clinging to outdated, ineffective methods. With this, we can guarantee the best for our future scholars and learners. We will also be able to shore up our rural support by directing funding to them in particular."
ENG_a_dinner_with_monty_desc:0 "Bernard Montgomery is one of the few men still alive who knows exactly why it was that the United Kingdom agreed to its own dismantlement. He was with Macmillan when the treaty was negotiated, and amongst the most fervent voices for maintaining the peace at all costs. His subsequent victory over the insurgent HMMLR has only made him more useful to the future of England, and perhaps its time he be brought more directly on board with that future.\n\nA meeting is required, and a reasonably private one at that. We can reach out to one of his stepsons to arrange it and broach the possible subjects. Namely the prevention of any future Operation Sealion. Montgomery will likely be interested, he's quite the reasonable man after all. We just need to give him the right incentive."
ENG_hunting_with_templar_desc:0 "Gerad Templer has long served England loyally, and his crucial role in preventing the foul organisation HMMLR from winning the Civil War has only increased the regard for him in the political classes. However, Templar never really got along all that well with us civilian officials, in no small part due to our position on the matter of throwing away German restrictions on the military apparatus.\n\nWith United England's new defensive foreign policy focus however, it might be possible to bring Mr Templer on board with our agenda. We can speak of it whilst on a fox hunt, which the man is known to love, especially on the subject of our current military strength and how that might be improved. Even in the worst case scenarios though, what harm could a little chat do?"
ENG_a_calm_day_in_parliament_desc:0 "The situation is actually rather decent at the moment. Yes, the foreign policy matter is a bit tense, and the Royal Party is simmering, yet within the party things are about as harmonious as they've ever been. The Party Chairman and the Prime Minister have even managed to get out the legislative agenda ahead of time, to the surprise of all who know the two men. Mayhaps they've sorted out their differences?\n\nWell, regardless of what is happening, it is quite refreshing to know that political differences aside, United England is beginning to coalesce into a party worth the label. Perhaps this new unity can be showcased in the speech PM Maudling is said to be preparing. It will certainly be an interesting listen."
ENG_the_aftermath_of_the_debate_desc:0 "Apparently you can never hammer the message home hard enough when it comes to the Liberal faction of United England. We protected them from Royal Party persecution, we aided them when they needed it, we even gave them the post of Prime Minister. Well, they evidently believe they deserve more. Oh, they'll get exactly what they deserve.\n\nMacmillan is distinctly unamused to hear some of these tales. More accurately, he has been put in a state of apoplectic rage over some of these tales, but that is hardly unexpected given the magnitude of this betrayal. Evidently, it is not the job of the Liberals to save England from Germany. Evidently, it is not their business to be in politics at all. When you want to do something right, you damn well do it yourself."
ENG_maudling_will_attack_us_for_the_last_time_desc:0 "The Liberals are still a part of United England nominally, but the recent events have left some easily distinguishable marks between those loyal to our Party Chairman and those loyal to the Prime Minister. Macmillan is still quite incensed at the betrayal of Maudling, but it must be admitted this was hardly unforeseen. A shame, he might have been quite useful if he hadn't acted so rashly.\n\nLet's go on the offensive, then. We've identified a number of troublemakers we can easily expel from the party, or at the very least impress upon them the seriousness of remaining loyal to the PM over the nation. Membership rolls will be purged, key supporters of the Prime Minister censured, and funding for the more Liberal members of United England stopped altogether. That's only the tip of the iceberg. We're just getting started."
ENG_pull_over_the_easily_persuaded_desc:0 "Not all of the Liberal members of United England were involved in the stupidity of Maudling, as much as we might not like to admit it. After all, they're just as opposed to fascism as we are, and the Party Chairman can respect that quite a bit in the current era. We can impress upon the wiser members that we really don't have any problems with their economic or social views, just their mistaken political allegiance.\n\nWe can probably pull over a dozen or so by doing this, and if we offer the right incentives to a few more, United England might start resembling the name it took. Even if we don't succeed in grabbing that many, one or two would be enough to make the point to PM Maudling. He isn't as secure as he might think."
ENG_the_liberals_will_know_their_place_desc:0 "Let it not be said that Macmillan is lacking in mercy. We will not destroy the Liberals in United England, but much rather we will merely cow them. They are too useful, after all. What will end, however, is their nominal independence. The Liberals had their chance to work mostly on their own, and they blew it. when they act, speak and campaign now it will be with men and women loyal to Macmillan looking over their shoulders.\n\nOf course, we cannot guarantee everyone will get the message. The Prime Minister will likely engage in some symbolic resistance, but it won't matter. Macmillan runs this country now, and what he decides will be is what will be."
ENG_dirty_dirty_chesterton_desc:0 "Oh, Chesterton, you bastard! The National Front is the single most despicable collection of traitors assembled this side of HMMLR, and at least HMMLR only intended on making us vassals to the Americans! The National Front and their collection of fascist braindead imbeciles would have happily sold us out to the Germans if they won the election. Unfortunately, they still have a base of public support to draw off of. For England's sake, this bastion of evil will need to be stomped out, and fast!\n\nWe can have some private investigators and the intelligence services dig for the more shocking crimes of the National Front, for the time being. As long as we get the dirt we need, it won't matter how long it takes for us to get it. When we have it, we can finally give that scum Chesterton the sendoff to Hell he deserves."
ENG_ban_the_black_shirts_desc:0 "Someone somewhere once said that revenge was a dish best served cold, and now that we are finally experiencing the feeling we can say without a doubt that that person was most assuredly right. The National Front, a successor to elements of the far right conservatives and the British Union of Fascists, was always far too keen about collaborating with the Germans. There was always mountains of evidence, but the Royal Party never seemed to feel it was the right time to act.\n\nThat's changed now. United England is not the Royal Party. We are men of action, not caricatures of corruption and nepotism. Hence, fascism is now the ideological equivalent of persona non grata in England. We'll ban their organisations, their parties, imprison the fools dumb enough to claim the label openly, and all the while they'll not be capable of lifting a finger against us."
ENG_ban_the_scourge_of_fascism_desc:0 "Well, for all that lofty proclamations of the illegality of fascism get the public's attention, sometimes it's better to avoid the potential conflicts down the road and address matters in the correct way, even if it's after the fact. The \"Banning of Fascism From Politics Act\" does, more or less, exactly what the title of the act states.\n\nOh, it's all hidden behind fancy words in the text of the act, but it doesn't take a genius to divine our feelings about fascism. The fascists are a band of traitors, criminals, and downright scum. United England hates them, England itself hates them, and hell, even the corrupt bastards in the Royal Party hate them! We are going to excise this cancer from England by any means necessary, and to do that we'll need to ban them outright. Who cares about what the Germans - a batch of good-for-nothing fascists - think?"
ENG_the_clean_royal_party_desc:0 "The Royal Party. Once, they were a more noble band of corrupt kleptocratic oligarchs, but now those days are long behind us. It's a shame, really. They served the purpose of keeping England out of the German grasp admirably for the years prior to the German Civil War, but they just weren't willing to go that extra step. Still, you make do with what you have, and we really don't have a use for them at the present time.\n\nNepotism beyond belief, corruption, multiple unconfirmed-but-probably politically motivated killings, the list simply goes on and on. How long should England have to live with these disgraceful politicians? Why should they have to live with them existing in a state of luxury whilst the common man works hard for his bread? The answer is, they shouldn't."
ENG_taking_out_our_trash_desc:0 "Obvious corruption comes with a single rather large advantage over traditional secretive corruption, which is that it's completely obvious to even the most cursory financial examination. How unfortunate for the Royal Party MP's, then, that they've grown used to open corruption over the course of some twenty years of unfettered power.\n\nWe shall launch a series of corruption investigations against the more prominent members of the Royal Party to start off with, but as things roll on we can go over every single Royal MP's records to seek the more hidden grifting as well. Party Chairman Macmillan will be very happy to see this go ahead smoothly."
ENG_dig_out_the_rotten_core_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we can't just imprison all of the corrupt Royal Party MP's. Aside from the negative press, most of them are legitimately guilty of little more than corruption, with only a handful actively collaborating with the Reich and fewer still to any provable extent at that. What we can do, however, is remove those corrupt MP's from parliament in a more conventional manner.\n\nOnce removed from office, new elections for their seats can be held. We might win some of them, but it's no great loss if we don't; we still have a majority. Macmillan's visionary leadership is starting to pan out, which makes one wonder what to do with Maudling."
ENG_the_deal_with_maudling_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling was useful for a time. Had he maintained faith with Party Chairman Macmillan, he might have been permitted to retain the seat of Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he was too greedy and, well, we don't need him anymore. We can't kick him out of the party, nor his Liberals, but we can reduce them to the subordinate role they always should have occupied.\n\nSay goodbye to PM Maudling, and hello to the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan! Oh, and Reggie is now the Vice Prime Minister, for the sake of his ego. Macmillan isn't cruel - he's just doing what he needs to do. That should always be remembered, so that we don't turn into the monsters that the Royal Party became."
ENG_the_PM_power_act_desc:0 "With Harold Macmillan now officially in charge, it is time to remove some of the restrictions we used to keep Maudling in line. For a start, the cabinet will be taking something of a backseat from now on, with the Prime Minister's office acquiring a great deal of executive power, so as to allow Macmillan to fully exercise his vision of a free and fair England.\n\nThere are those who condemn this as some sort of power grab, but they merely lack the understanding of just how important Macmillan is to the continued functioning of England. It was he who guided us up until this point. For his deeds, he has more than earned the right to exercise a significant say in political matters. Out of respect for his vision, we will not stop him. Macmillan will save English democracy, and the people will cheer him on."

It took us years to even get to this point, years of struggle and bargaining and sacrifice, all for the ideal of a nation where choice was not dictated by some master in Washington or Germania but from London.\n\nIt is Harold Macmillan who got us here, he recognised when it was necessary to stand down and preserve what could be saved, he kept the Germans out of England through guile and dealmaking, he preserved our institutions from within the Royal Party. Now, as Prime Minister he shall ensure that both Democracy and England are protected with the zeal of a man in his prime. Until the last, we do this for England."

But both our politicians and our populace believed that would be the end of surprises as far as they year went. It would seem that asking for calm is pointless however as our government has just received a rather alarming phone call.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII of the House of Windsor, King of England, has abdicated effective immediately. It is easy enough to understand why he did this, aside from being a man of weak political skills and hated by a rather significant percentage of the population, His Majesty could conceivably be held to be at fault for the events of the recent Civil War to some degree. When that is your legacy is it any wonder a man loses the desire to rule?"

He is our only realistic legitimate option for a successor to Edward VIII, and though he might dislike the idea of becoming monarch, we can remind him of all the strife England might avoid if he did his duty. Aside from the former King, that family are a dependable lot after all."

Our first action now should be to establish whom shall act as His Majesty's official regent, and from there we will need to go over succession plans. It is quite likely we will be in need of them sooner rather than later if our current run of luck holds."

Young but not overly so, and more importantly for us he's well on board with our government on the subject of how the nation should be run, to a greater degree than his incapacitated father even. This is good, as given the health of King Henry it is quite likely that William will be taking up the full responsibilities of his fathers position quite soon.\n\nFor now however, William of the House of Windsor will simply act as Prince-Regent to the king. Taking over the official duties which require his majesty to be capable of travelling across the nation. This might prove a good time to get William introduced to the responsibilities of leadership, so to some extent we ought to be thankful."

In these troubling times it is a strong hand that is required to marshal the nations strength, and King William will assist our government in keeping this will at the forefront of our policies.

Now it is up to us to fulfill our promise.\n\nWe in United England do swear this, to protect the principles of democracy which made our nation great in times past.

Democracy under that party was a decayed and fragile thing, the only party ever able to run without opposition was the RP, with anyone not an independent suffering intimidation or suspiciously great wins for the Royal Party come election time.\n\nBut it was not always so, there was a time where every man had his say and parties of all sorts could attempt to appeal to the individual voter.

No matter how much the Royal Party might want to, they couldn't and cannot now kill the idea of democracy. For ideas are as the mountains, unmoving to the whims of mere mortal men."

As the Party Chairman does not completely trust the people loyal to him to be loyal to the dream of restoring English democracy, he will allow the Liberal faction of United England under Maudling to have a great deal of influence in how the government dictates policy.\n\nYet, it behooves us to note that we shouldn't merely accept what is handed out to us. Why should we live with crumbs, when a whole cake is there for the taking? Building up some of our own proper support networks now that we no longer need fear the intervention of the Royal Party might be a good start, and then we can proceed to meet and plan out our true goals."
ENG_our_partners_next_door_desc:0 "The Liberal faction of United England is not the dominant one it pains the Prime Minister to admit. Party Chairman Macmillan is the driving force behind United England and that is unlikely to change at the present time, thus we must seek to not oust the Macmillanists but convert them to the cause of democracy. Or at least the cause of Maudling.\n\nTruthfully there is some potential in this proposal, after all even the most conservative of Macmillan's followers despises fascism with a passion and tolerate unhindered democracy in theory. All we need do is convince them that Macmillan won't be around forever, and that it might be profitable to get their names in with the new leadership sooner rather than later."

The Germans still lurk just beyond the English Channel after all and no matter our courage we will need a plan to keep them satisfied or mayhaps deterred. The Prime Minister will also need to inquire as to the actual state of our forces, bloodied as they are by the recent civil war.

Anyone further to the left than liberalism is subject to open intimidation, our election fraud is an international as well as national scandal, and to top it all off we have open fascists who disdain democracy in Parliament.\n\nTo save the soul of England we will need to convince the people that United England as a party is different from the Royal Party. That we truly believe in the system that made our nation the most powerful on earth once upon a time. We will then turn this belief into action by repairing our political infrastructure, but this process of democratization is long and hard. We will need to put in every effort."

Yet now something is different, and as ordinary Englishmen walk the streets unawares the Liberal faction of United England has begun to assert its dominance.\n\nReginald Maudling is starting to be a Prime Minister in truth and not in name only, and with this \"Great Shift\" seemingly unlikely to cease in the immediate future it would seem that United England looks set to be united in truth, one way or another."

We didn't make the mistakes of HMMLR and achieve this liberation through violence, instead it was through democracy, liberal ideals and deal making that our land has been freed of the Germanic yoke.\n\nIt is perhaps time that we draw the public's attention to this fact, to show that we mean what we say in our election campaigns and that not all of England's problems will be solved by bloodshed and corruption. We do not just liberate our nation from foreign rule, but from its own darkest fears."

Some cabinet responsibilities we can delegate as well, but we should take care to ensure that even if nothing else that he is not disrespected. Macmillan protected us for years, it would be unjust to push him away without recompense."
ENG_daughters_of_anglia_learn_desc:0 "Education, education, education. The Royal Party were a bunch of laggards on that particular subject, feeling free to let our academic system rot from the inside as teachers were under trained or forced to steer away from politically sensitive topics. Well we're here now and unfortunately it's our duty to fix things.\n\nWe should be careful in our reforms to instill a love of democracy in our youth without encouraging them to associate democracy solely with our own party, which would lead to many problems in the future. So too should we take steps to ensure girls and boys both benefit from these educational opportunities, and that the poor have access as much as the middle class who are the most consistent in sending their children to school."
ENG_britons_vote_desc:0 "Democracy is a fragile system, it requires willing and activate participation from a majority of the population to be truly effective, and the last few decades have strained the public confidence in our electoral system to the breaking point. The people remember the rigged elections of the Royal Party, and the suppression of those who stood against them, which means that if we want our reforged democracy to survive long term we need to make the public believe its real once again.\n\nA series of campaigns over radio and television, and even regular old newspaper adverts to encourage voting in not just national but local council elections would be a good start, and from there we can move on to the business of actually registering the millions of potential voters left neglected in prior governments."
ENG_weaken_the_macmillanists_desc:0 "Despite the recent decision on part of the Party Chairman to operate in the background now that the Liberal faction of United England are starting to wield more active influence in party matters, there are still some Macmillanists who refuse to accept our authority. The reasons vary, for some it is personal dislike of the Prime Minister or Liberalism in general, a fair few are just unwilling to see Macmillan make preparations to leave, but in the end its all the same problem to our Prime Minister. Maudling cannot let this go unanswered.\n\nWe can replace the most vocal with our own supporters, preferably former Macmillanists who now see things our way, this action serving the twofold purpose of sending a message to the recaltrients and rewarding those who turned their coats. Hopefully it will be enough."
ENG_liberal_propaganda_desc:0 "Propaganda is a rather strong word, but when you have opponents like ours is it really that bad? Let us be honest, the National Front is a collection of far rightists who would gladly send us back to the dark days of the German occupation for control of the country. On top of being filthy scum sucking fascists. The Royal Party on the other hand makes a mockery of the term, being so corrupt as to make even the worst elements of United England seem tame in comparison. Truthfully it isn't even a lie to say both would be utter disasters for English democracy.\n\nHence, why we will be paying for advertisements against our opposition, hopefully quashing any attempt to defeat us at the polls before it can arise."
ENG_the_equal_vote_act_desc:0 "It might surprise some, but until this moment there was no specific protection by Parliament or legal precedent that stated unequivocally that every man and woman had a single vote, and indeed there were some conditions which prevented persons from exercising their vote depending upon their race.\n\nThis ends today, as with the Equal Vote Act this government puts to rest the archaic practices of discrimination that have so defined prior ministries in England. Be they man or woman, of caucasion or african heritage, and over the age of 18, any English citizen now has the same vote as any other that they can exercises at will and as they see fit during national and council elections."
ENG_what_is_in_the_systems_of_the_past_desc:0 "What exactly is it that led to the downfall of the United Kingdom? What led its successor into a bloody Civil War? What failures have caused civil unrest and tens of thousands of dead Britons? These are the questions the Prime Minister has long debated, Maudling is, after all, quite the philosophical fellow and tries to model his leadership on the successes of the path rather than the failures. Unfortunately there is something of a paucity of the former but a man can make do.\n\nThe answer to these particular questions however is one that came to him almost by chance. Control is the problem, not the existence of a man controlling everything that occurs in a nation, or even temporary absolute control, but the power that comes with control is a tempting one that corrupts those who wield it. We must take care that we do not outstay our welcome."
ENG_what_is_in_our_views_for_the_future_desc:0 "England stands at a great precipice, one wrong step could send us over the edge and into the pit of dictatorship and corruption, letting the flower of democracy wither away in the darkness. But should we tread the path with care we could well see all our efforts rewarded, and English democracy bloom in the light.\n\nThis is Reginald Maudling's view of our potential futures. We are far enough along to be so close to success, but just far enough away to need to worry about the chasm still. It will not be an easy journey to reach a fully functioning democracy, it will not be a walk in the park. This last stretch will require great efforts from us, for even greater rewards."
ENG_the_clear_parliament_act_desc:0 "Frankly the people don't trust Parliament at the present time, seeing it as an almost otherworldly force that does as it pleases when it pleases and they only get to read about it in the newspapers.\n\nThe Clear Parliament Act is one of the Prime Ministers more original ideas to be quite honest, showing the path to democracy by showing how the demcoratic process works to the general populace. Recordings of parliamentary sessions will be made available to the general public via the BBC and any observer may deign to look upon the government in action during these sessions. It is not a perfect system of course, but as systems go it is certainly better than most."
ENG_the_kids_born_into_a_corrupt_system_desc:0 "It is a rare thing that a Prime Minister can have something truly in common with even the lowliest of paupers, but Reginald Maudling raised a child through the dark years of England. His daughter Caroline is just one of an entire generation who grew up knowing their country at its lowest state, and there are many thousands like her who are disillusioned, despondent and out of work.\n\nThe Prime Minister has personally advocated for a programme to assist the youth of these troubled times, giving them access to more opportunities to better themselves, get jobs and escape the systems which entrap them in lives of drudgery and misery. If even a few make it out, it will have been money well spent."
ENG_the_students_will_learn_the_new_way_desc:0 "The youth have a certain amount of influence on society that often goes overlooked, namely that their beliefs are shaped in large part by the years of their early twenties, and then often set solid for life barring some great upheaval. Well, we can certainly use that.\n\nThe \"New Way\" is the term coined for Prime Minister Maudling's comprehensive series of reforms and changes to the education and political systems. Encouraging public backing of democratic ideals, tolerance for different ways of life and experimentation and a general lessening of the law and order focussed public appeals of prior Ministries. The children of this age will grow up in a land of tolerance and freedom of expression, it is our hope they can pass these ideals on to their own children some day."
ENG_the_liberal_education_act_desc:0 "The Liberal Education Act is somewhat ostentatiously named it must be admitted, but accuracy is important when making major changes that will affect the general public and this bill of reform will most certainly do just that.\n\nThe overarching goal of the Act is a fairly concise one, that inaccuracies, biases and faults in the education system which have been extant up until this point, the actions of the coalition government in the Second World War and their portrayal for example, will be corrected. Additionally more funding will be given to universities and facilities of higher education, so as to increase the number of trained specialists in various professions available to England."
ENG_no_more_government_news_paper_desc:0 "It would be fair to say that despite our efforts to reduce government influence over the mass media, there have been some things which have escaped our notice and amongst these items is the fact that the government owns in part or in totality several of the larger and more well read news corporations and broadcasters.\n\nWhilst not in theory a bad thing, the potential for this to be misused by ourselves let alone the other less scrupulous political parties is quite frankly a bit unsettling. The companies will be privatised with the exception of the EBC, which shall return to its prior mandate of being an apolitical broadcaster. This can be used as an example to the public of our commitment to the liberal ideal of a government which is hands off, hopefully without giving the Royal Party a way back in."
ENG_the_modern_media_desc:0 "Strangely, the Royal Party never really got around to encouraging the widespread adoption of personal televisions and radios in all their years of governance. Perhaps we should be less surprised, after all they often forgot to pretend they weren't a party of the elite.\n\nBut it behooves us to not acknowledge the utility of these devices, a television can grant knowledge of the wider worlds events to anyone willing to listen, a radio much the same and for cheaper prices. We should invest in ensuring that the people of England have opportunities to view all the political points available, and not just that which the government deems to be acceptable. The media apparatus will probably be happy with this as well, after all a higher viewership is never a bad move."
ENG_the_free_press_act_desc:0 "It has been the policy of Prime Minister Reginald Maudling in particular and the United England party as an institution that the prior restrictions on the nature and content which politics is reported in ought to be changed. Indeed, we have greatly lessened the restrictions upon most Broadcasting networks and our influence upon them up until this point, but it does rather fall to us to make this sort of thing official.\n\nThe Free Press Act officially and permanently bans the influence of politicians upon the media, with grave repercussions for those caught doing so. Additionally it prevents the government or those employed by the government from owning political media networks. With luck some of the opposition might even listen to us."
ENG_the_start_of_something_beautiful_desc:0 "It is a slow process, much like gardening. You don't notice its growth by the minute or even by the hour, but slowly and surely democracy is beginning to take root once more in England. Be it the debates you can hear in pubs that would have been out of the question a scant few years before, or the numerous independent or minor parties seeking council and even parliamentary seats. You can see it in the eyes of students and the voices of up and coming aids, people are once more beginning to believe in democracy.\n\nThis is what United England always wanted, and thanks to Reginald Maudling it is what we have to boast about. The beauty of a working democracy is something we will need to nurture, until it can survive without us."

ENG_the_people_have_our_back_desc:0 "United England has never been the most stable of parties. Granted, we all have the common goal of opposing the corruption and ineptitude of the Royal Party, but the relations between our factions are nonetheless somewhat strained. Despite this, we have evidently been successful at our goals, for in spite of what our good \"friends\" in the opposition have alleged us of doing, and despite our own problems as a party, we have just been reelected to government.\n\nThe people have chosen what is right over promises our opponents cannot keep, and so now it falls to us to come through on our own promises. The necessary work of turning England into a nation we can be proud of, and ensuring nobody interrupts that work before it is done."
ENG_fascism_failed_again_desc:0 "Fascism is a blight upon all that is good and just in this world, a cancer upon nations and states across the globe that ought to be burned in the hellfire it spawned from. Yet in England we have prevented its rise, we have prevented the insidious infection from seizing power and influence for its masters in Germania. All thanks to the work of Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\n\nMacmillan who recognised the mistake of the Royal Party in allowing the fascist hardliners into their ranks, who has always and will continue to oppose it wherever it rears its ugly head in England. England stands united by its traditions, its spirit and its Prime Minister. Fascism and all who act as its agents are not welcome here."
ENG_lets_make_sure_that_it_will_never_rise_again_desc:0 "When a feral dog attacks a human being, you do not coddle the animal. You do not let it live whilst the potential for danger remains from it. Any sensible person merely compels it to stay still before blasting the diseased creature in the head, and the metaphor being used here ought to be applied to those who would corrupt England's soul with fascism as well.\n\nNot literally, unfortunately, there are certain standards which must be maintained after all. No, we need to choose a target. Our work will require that the so called "loyal opposition" be neutralized on a political level. It's quite unfortunate, but then again, we wouldn't need to do this if they hadn't collectively decided to become filthy rat-bastard scum-of-the-earth German-loving whoreson traitors. If they didn't, we wouldn't be here. The question is, who's a bigger traitor?"
ENG_combat_the_royal_party_desc:0 "The Royal Party. Once, we were a part of that dismal mess of a coalition. The Prime Minister himself felt they were the only option to keep England's spirit alive and kicking, everything else seemed likely to only get England's best hope quashed, like so many other groups. Now, they act as the voice of Germania in England, second only to the disgusting National Front.\n\n20 years they had to change, 20 long and tiring years where we tried to convince them that not all was lost, that we could strive for better things, better ideals than simple survival. We were ignored, and so we come to the crossroads we were always going to reach. The Royal Party and its tendrils throughout English society die today, we shall be the ones to kill it."
ENG_lure_the_germanophiles_desc:0 "The most odious portion of the Royal Party by far is that section known in common parlance as the \"germanophiles\". An odd group, not really organised around a singular leader so much as they are united in their shared disdain for loyalty to their country and a desire for the perks they so enjoyed when England was under their leadership. Well, these opportunists are to be our first targets, and how fortuitous is it that we have a sting operation just ready and waiting in the wings.\n\nWe won't make up any evidence, some letters will be sent to them and they will be invited to a meeting with what they thinking is a German intelligence officer. The rest will be all up to them. The PM thinks he won't be disappointed."
ENG_are_these_the_people_you_voted_for_desc:0 "A tip for whenever members of our party seek to set up political stings in the future, always make sure that there was a minimum of prodding from yourselves, and that the targets were the ones who implicated themselves in whatever they thought was going on. It's a matter of publicity, the man on the street might not care if an MP is arrested for what he might have done, but will pay far more attention to the man arrested for joining a plot he thought was legitimate.\n\nThe meeting will occur, we will record the whole thing and have the constabulary arrest them in full view of the press as they leave the building. The public won't even know we were involved."
ENG_investigate_the_royal_party_desc:0 "We never did get around to launching a truly thorough investigation into the Royal Party. Maybe it was foolish optimism on our part, but the Prime Minister believed the corrupt imbeciles might get the hint when the worst eggs of the bunch were removed. Predictably, the Royal Party has shown itself to be a rats nest of corruption and ineptitude. There isn't even any sign that the party leadership are shocked by some of the accusations the press level against them.\n\nSo, given the situation at hand, we will resolve it with an iron fist. Every single MP and high ranking member of the Royal Party will be investigated, thoroughly. We will find everything, every secret and every crime they've ever been party to. Then, we will solve the matter of the disloyal opposition once and for all."
ENG_reveal_the_findings_desc:0 "Oh, how satisfying victory can be. Our investigations went ahead, and the things they uncovered have shocked even some of the most optimistic of our intelligence services. 187 pages worth of shocking acts, lies, and secrets the Royal Party would, and sometimes did, kill to keep out of the limelight. It's all ours, every single piece of their dirty deeds.\n\n187 pages of shame, 187 pages of criminality, 187 pages of corruption. We can show it to the press ourselves, give them copies, hell, give the people copies to hand out by the dozen. Let the entire nation see what the Royal Party really is, not the facade they have been careful to keep. Let them be judged as they would have judged us. A fitting punishment for traitors!"
ENG_the_corruption_act_desc:0 "Public opinion is an important thing, you know, and why should it not be? Is not our legitimacy gained by the people's commitment to never again letting fascism have a grip over England? Oh, the Royal Party might not strictly be fascist, but being so completely and utterly corrupt that you get caught trying to sell the nation to the Germans is somewhat embarrassing at the very least.\n\nHence the introduction of the Corruption Act by Prime Minister Macmillan and Deputy PM Maudling. An act which crystalises the policy of United England in a series of easy to read paragraphs, perfect for public consumption. Unofficially, this is just the simplest way to indict most of the Royal Party in one fell swoop. We can deal with leftovers later."
ENG_lock_the_traitors_up_desc:0 "The Royal Party is a stain on our heroic history. These cowards decided they would rather kneel on a plastic throne than challenge the German occupiers, then proceeded to use their position as nothing but a fast track to self-enrichment. Each and everyone of them are just as responsible for the Civil War as the terrorists themselves, and they should be treated as such.\n\nOur preparations must be quick. A few hasty trials in a makeshift courtroom, and we will send these empty suits to receive proper justice, mostly involving a brick wall and a group of riflemen. United England will live up to its ideals by removing the parasites who sought to drive our once-righteous nation into weak servility, and create a united front against those who wish to see us bow before Germany. For the dream of a union to live, the Royal Party must die."
ENG_crackdown_on_the_NF_desc:0 "There do not, in the fair English language, exist a series of words properly profane enough to describe our Prime Minister's thoughts on the political organisation known as the National Front. We could call them traitors, except that many actual traitors had a great deal more scruples. We could call them spies and German sympathisers, which would be entirely accurate, yet still not quite give the full scope of their debauchery.\n\nNo, perhaps an accurate description is not needed at the time being, it doesn't affect our plan after all. Under the direct orders of the Prime Minister, the National Front is to be considered a subversive foreign organisation, and dealt with as such. We will end the madness of English fascism permanently."
ENG_the_last_rats_in_england_desc:0 "The National Front isn't quite as great a force as it once was. We wouldn't like to take all the credit, some of which must obviously go to the insanity of the organisation in question, but we must admit that it was a pleasure to dismantle it piece by piece.\n\nNow it's just Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, his little gang of sycophants, and a handful of others that are left, a paltry band from the force that briefly sought to rival both United England and the Royal Party, but enough to be worth destroying all the same. It's a bit of a shame we don't have that old bastard Moseley around anymore, since he'd make an excellent target for our most righteous vengeance, but we make do with what we can get. Chesterton will suffice."
ENG_plant_the_poison_desc:0 "We didn't hold much faith in the general intelligence of the National Front's remaining MP's, but we, the Intelligence services, and almost all persons with functioning brains thought that they'd be smarter than to reply to message which, to paraphrase an officer involved in its writing, stated \"We are planning to invade, would you be willing to head a government? Sincerely, Germany.\"\n\nThe sheer imbecility is simply jaw dropping, and quite satisfying, to be quite honest. Saying the truth that the National Front are filthy traitors is all well and good, having actual treachery to catch them being involved in is quite another thing entirely. The Prime Minister is ecstatic, the opportunity of a lifetime has arrived on his desk and Macmillan fully intends to use it. Let's not keep the police waiting."
ENG_jail_the_rats_desc:0 "Victory is worth all that it took to arrive there, and our victory is worth thrice as much and then some if you listen to the United England MP's. Arthur Kenneth Chesterton, caught in a sting with his party about to commit to supporting a German invasion of our fair isle, the headlines just couldn't be better! We have the trial just about set up now, the rats languish in their cells for the time being, though.\n\nPM Macmillan has stated he's open to hearing opinions on what their long term fates ought to be. Nobody thinks execution is quite the right answer at the moment, but the possibility is definitely being floated."
ENG_a_letter_to_ches_desc:0 "Why go to so much effort when you can get the point across politely? Seems all a bit too much work for one traitor and his band of malcontents, no, Prime Minister Macmillan will handle this one personally.\n\nThe letter will be short and to the point, Arthur Kenneth Chesterton's days in politics are over. If he insists on disputing this, he will suffer the consequences of his past actions that have thus far been postponed for one reason or another. Either he's stupid enough to confront us, or smart enough to know we'll never let him get within twenty miles of a reporter."
ENG_send_him_to_germania_desc:0 "The National Front is a German sponsored subversive organisation, and you unfortunately need a better justification than 'German lapdog' to start executing. Vice Prime Minister Maudling came up with quite the inventive solution to our issue, \"Why not let the Germans have them?\" It's simple and stunningly effective, who will openly support the National Front when they see our enemies giving them succour?\n\nPrime Minister Macmillan is in full agreement with the Liberal faction's suggestions for once, and we have already begun making the preparations for the extradition of Chesterton and his friends. Well, \"extradition\" in the sense of dumping them in the German embassy. It will do."
ENG_the_antifascist_act_desc:0 "Fascism is a plague, a disease upon all that is well and good in English society. It moulds and corrupts what it touches into parodies of their original selves, burning a scar right into the fabric of entire institutions. This will be allowed no longer, and with the Anti Fascist Act, United England will be seen to do what every government prior to now should have. We will scourge this monstrosity from our island.\n\nThe key to this, of course, is to not merely make fascism illegal, but also those ideologies adjacent to it, the sort which the fascists would attempt to camouflage their insidious beliefs with. By banning them too, we can still easily reach the deplorables. We can call our little scuffle with the National Front finished once the last of them are rotting in prison as a reward for their cleverness."
ENG_the_liberal_flower_desc:0 "The Liberals, such a quaint little group. Once, they were our only effective allies, but in recent times the Prime Minister has been doubting their worth for a variety of reasons, not least that they seem oddly squeamish about preventing the disloyal opposition from using elections as a cover to bring back the Germans.\n\nOptimism is all well and good, but not when you apply it to honourless thugs like Thatcher and Chesterton. Granted, one of them isn't truly a problem for us anymore, yet we still need to address the root cause here. The Liberals weaken us. They represent a vulnerability in United England's armour. We must patch it, however we can."
ENG_silence_them_desc:0 "Their ability to appeal to the ordinary Englishman has always been the strength of the Liberals, and now that they're beginning to act in opposition to United England's goals, it might be worth addressing what could be called an emerging threat.\n\nNothing harmful of course, no, we'll just have some frank conversations with the media outlets, especially those on radio and television. It wouldn't do for some of the more disaffected to lose sight of their purpose and start blaming us for the failures of the Liberals. This is no kindness, but it is necessary if we are to expunge the weakness that might allow the beast of fascism back into England."
ENG_fire_those_who_resist_desc:0 "One advantage of Maudling tipping his hand all those months ago is that it has shown us that leaving the reigns of party power in the hands of the untrustworthy is a mistake not worth repeating. To save the soul of England, we will need to quash those who might object before they can use their influence against us.\n\nWe can fire the radical liberals from their positions, and those unwilling to work with us can simply be expelled from the party. There exists the possibility that we might be underestimating them, however, so just in case we'll deal with any Liberal associates in the officer core as well. It never hurts to cover all your bases on matters like these."
ENG_maudlings_friends_desc:0 "Reginald Maudling has been a stalwart ally despite his own flaws and ambition. Perhaps that is why the next step will be so difficult, for he has many who respect him. They probably don't know about his two-faced nature.\n\nPrime Minister Macmillan ought to be the one to do it. Maudling and Macmillan know one another decently well, so Macmillan will be able to break the news to him the best. With luck, we can give him a position of little authority outside the party for him to fritter the rest of his days away on."
ENG_must_go_desc:0 "By far, the greatest shame about this whole affair is having to explain what is happening to Maudling himself. The man deserved better, but his weakness will not serve England well if he were to remain in a position of influence and power. No, it is better this way, after all at least he'll still have responsibilities, just not political ones anymore.\n\nHe'll probably enjoy the relaxation after the last few stressful years he's had."
ENG_the_protection_of_democracy_act_desc:0 "The time has come. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan can look over England now and see a land dedicated to the expulsion and fighting of fascism wherever it lies. However, we must take steps to ensure things remain this way, now that we've dealt with the Liberals and half of the opposition.\n\nThe "Protection of Democracy Act" will play a fairly outsized role in this, the act itself is one of the more complex pieces put to Parliament by the Prime Minister, but it holds true in the essentials to the vision of United England. It gives the office of Prime Minister certain discretionary powers when it comes to matters of national security, in addition to the ability to determine what is and isn't a fascist group. All for the good of the people."
ENG_the_royal_party_rots_desc:0 "Sometimes you win some, sometimes you lose some. The Royal Party has definitely been on the latter end of that phrase, the once mighty titan of English politics reduced to a tottering behemoth that could fall at any moment.\n\nPerhaps it would be a mercy to put the Royal Party down before they descend further. In any case, the best way to fell a giant is to strike at their legs. We will finish this bastion of corrupt traitors and move on. May England remember them for the monsters they became, and not the party they once were."
ENG_those_who_got_away_desc:0 "As surprising as it might be, the monstrous corruption of the Royal Party is not a universal fact. Oh, for sure, the majority is irredeemably corrupt, but there exist a handful of moderates who align with the RP out of genuine belief rather than any allegiance to the corrupt system which perpetuated the Royal Party.\n\nConsidering the number of pressing events we have on our schedule at the moment, it might be worth doing to leave them be. First, of course, we will need some insurance."
ENG_make_them_bend_the_knee_desc:0 "An opposition is a useful thing, "better us than them" as Harold Macmillan says. Thus, despite our contempt for the handful of idiots still following the Royal Party, we shall let them be, so long as we have some assurances of their conduct.\n\nA simple signed agreement will do. It will be a simple promise for the Royal Party, where they promise not to pursue any actions that would destabilize the government, to do their utmost to discourage fascism where they can, and to not get in our way. Most of them will keep to it, but there might be one or two to use as an example."
ENG_make_them_repent_desc:0 "Why have principled men if you can't use them? Prime Minister Macmillan will call a press conference soon where the Royal Party Moderates will denounce the rest of the party they serve to the public. We'll need to ensure the media get the story right, but once it's done we will have struck a blow against the corrupt heart of the party.\n\nConservatism is a paternalistic ideal after all, and we're simply ensuring the wayward children of the Royal Party demonstrate their fealty to the true protectors of England."
ENG_the_opposition_disappears_desc:0 "The Moderates are now puppets, moving along the strings we have set. While it is true that they could have potentially been the foundation of a capable anti-fascist organization, the possibility that they could have become a threat to our government was far too high. Now, they answer to the same man as the rest of England. Harold Macmillan.\n\nMacmillan is a man of his word, and for the Moderate leadership's cooperation, they will not fall victim to acts and measures they would otherwise find inconvenient. It's only fair. Additionally, they will be permitted to keep the seats they currently hold."
ENG_the_iron_lady_with_greed_desc:0 "Mrs Thatcher is a curious woman, it really must be said. Unlike the rest of her corrupt abomination of a party, she has some principles with which she conducts herself, an affair which seems to baffle her coworkers.\n\nWe face something of a conundrum in dealing with the woman known as the Iron Lady. Perhaps we should just sweep her aside with the rest of her party, but Her potential to lead as a puppet opposition leader is great enough to counterbalance the risks. Even more than that, showing the olive branch towards other non-fascist parties will go a long way towards helping our cause."
ENG_ally_the_thatcherists_desc:0 "Sometimes you need to look at the broken things to rediscover their use properly, and the Thatcherite faction of the Royal Party might yet have some purpose for us. We won't give them promises we can't keep, rather we'll offer the old tradition of the bread or the club.\n\nThere won't be any grand speeches from Mrs. Thatcher. No, all she will be doing is signing a simple and polite agreement dictating the actions of her party. Especially in regards to a certain neighbor across the channel. While the Royal Party may have an unfortunate record of leaking to the Germans, they will now only leak what we want them to."
ENG_a_puppet_on_strings_desc:0 "The Iron Lady has bent rather than be broken, and it's a right good thing she did. As far as the public is concerned, Mrs Thatcher is still the head of the opposition, but in actual fact the remnant Royal Party answer to the same man as the rest of England, Harold Macmillan.\n\nWe'll let her keep her reputation and dignity, for as long as Thatcher serves the interests of England no harm shall come to her."
ENG_much_like_the_rest_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher is too dangerous to leave at our back. The woman turned the corrupt shell of a party which had been split three ways into the second most fearsome political force in England. Who knows what she could do, give some actual time and the absence of our interference.\n\nUnited England will do the proper thing. We will end our opposition once and for all without giving them an opportunity to crawl underground. England's corruption will burn away today, and it shall be United England that lights the match."
ENG_swamp_the_thatcherists_desc:0 "Luckily for us, we still have plenty of dirt on Thatcher and her gang from our time inside the Royal Party and subsequent infiltration of the modern one. We'll need some extra evidence, though, so let's set a bit of bait.\n\nNothing obvious, just enough to ensure that we get the right people on the right set of charges. We still need the public to buy the trial's legitimacy after all, and too much evidence might go against the grain."
ENG_thatcherists_pacified_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher, once the only serious rival to Harold Macmillan for dominion of English politics, is now no longer an issue to be concerned with. Let us move on to better and bigger things, now that corruption and fascism both have been excised from English politics and replaced with more virtuous and sensible political ideals.\n\nThe Royal Party was a good opposition for a time, it must be said, but all things come to an end. It's best we close the door on this act of history."
ENG_no_longer_a_threat_desc:0 "Thatcher's talk of unity and strength in the Royal Party was not meant to apply to England as a whole, but rather the sickly chimera she led. Now that we have pushed her out of government and into a cold cell, we can finally begin building a free, united England in peace. Our economy will not be sold out to wealthy elites, our government will not be dictated by the iron will of one woman; our party will preserve all the ideals that make England great."
ENG_the_patriot_act_desc:0 "It is an age of information, and thanks to a rather obscure case going through the courts recently, we will now be able to have all the information on our citizens that we need to protect them.\n\nThe Patriot Act is the cornerstone of England's new domestic policy on matters of national security, namely that the government has the prerogative to take any action needed to protect the nation from fascist subversion and treachery."
ENG_my_allegiance_is_to_macmillan_and_democracy_desc:0 "Harold Macmillan has led us to greatness. Under his guidance England has once more ascended to a position of respect, if not influence, on the international stage. Internal enemies have been swept aside, and the twin evils of corruption and fascism excised from the national consciousness.\n\nYes, the path has been a hard one, and some have fallen along the way, but compared to the alternative, our actions have been a mercy upon the people of England. Let it be heard by all who would listen, God save the King and long live Prime Minister Macmillan!"
ENG_a_chance_for_freedom_desc:0 "Victory is a sweet nectar, and one on which you can be distracted should you sup upon it too greatly, but let us no downplay the scale of our victory here and today. We won, for the 2nd time in recent history in a democratic election it was United England who emerged victorious. Not the Royal Party and their sycophants or the madmen of the National Front.\n\nWe have the people to thank for this, the people who recognised the necessity of our continued governance. As a show of thanks, we shall give them what they asked for. A return to the glories of the past under the aegis of democracy."
ENG_but_freedom_has_its_costs_desc:0 "Democracy is the ideal which has long motivated United England, but unfortunately it seems that even the purest of ideals is vulnerable to threats from the inside. Opposition to our actions has been mounting from the remnant National Front, who seem poised to make a resurgence should nothing be done about them.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporations who appreciated our economic policies are starting to get a bit big for their boots, trying to exert their influence in the political sphere. It is time that we end this charade that we will allow those once ruled us with us to destroy or corrupt what we built. We have work to do."
ENG_targeting_corporatism_desc:0 "Though socialism is undeniably incorrect on many things, we must reluctantly admit that they might have had a point on the whole "corrupt corporations" issue. The industrial giants and their aristocratic backers are seeking to make this newly flowered democracy one puppeted by their hands, and they are showing interest in buying politicians, votes, even electoral commissioners.\n\nIf our ideal is to survive we must stop this here and now, and one way or another that is exactly what we will do."
ENG_the_giant_that_poisons_our_democracy_desc:0 "The influence of money in politics is like a poison, slowly but surely turning even the noblest of men and women into nothing more than the string puppets of laughing businessmen. If the current crop of CEO's and well to do families get it into their heads that they can influence the process with impunity there will be no going back.\n\nOur first step should be addressing where the influence flows from, before we try to address the matter of who is influenced. Should we succeed then we may make the lives of future generations far easier."
ENG_separating_business_and_democracy_desc:0 "Obviously we cannot remove the influence of business from politics completely, and unfortunate though it may be we do need them around to keep money flowing into our coffers. But that doesn't mean we can't have some regulations on the subject of money and politics.\n\nThese guidelines will be minimalistic, but hopefully they can prevent any overt conflicts of interest, namely by forcing recusal in the case where profit could be garnered by an MP on a vote and strict limits on campaign donations otherwise. It won't prevent everything, but it will stop the worst abuses."
ENG_the_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "The military industrial complex of England might not be quite the giant it was back in the days of the Empire, but nonetheless it is still a force to be reckoned with. Hawkish politicians still infest parliament, and it isn't uncommon for businesses with military leanings to lobby for certain actions or interests in Parliament.\n\nIf we were to remove this influence, it is quite possible our military might actually start becoming responsive to what England needs rather than what her suppliers need us to buy."
ENG_both_at_the_opposition_and_back_at_home_desc:0 "United England has been at the forefront of political reform for many of these past years, but just because we want reform doesn't mean some vipers don't exist within our ranks as well as the opposition. We will contact the relevant authorities to begin investigations into the rank and file of United England, mostly to sweep up the obvious abuses and corruptions but also to remind our membership that being apart of the governing party does not grant immunity from consequences.\n\nBesides, it'll look good in the public's eye and that never hurts a bit."
ENG_the_fair_politics_act_desc:0 "The Fair Politics Act aims to reduce the amount of influence that money has on the political landscape, not by removing it entirely but instead by evening the playing field. To begin with, no donations of over 2000 pounds can be accepted to a political campaign unless for charitable purposes, all campaigns will receive some amount of treasury subsidising for basic expenses, and no politician can be in direct control or contact with a business during their term of office.\n\nWith luck we can gradually expand this act into an overarching series of rules for political conduct, preventing abuses by all involved and establishing ironclad penalties for breaches of the act."
ENG_targeting_fascism_desc:0 "We might not agree with Harold Macmillan on everything, but it behooves us to listen to him when he actually has a point. What brought down the England we are trying to restore? Fascism. What corrupt and evil system had free reign over our nation for almost two decades, causing many of our current problems? Fascism. And who, right now sits with us, unwelcome, in the House of Parliament? Fascists.\n\nMacmillan was right, fascism is a disease to be combatted, but we must be surgical as we remove it, so as not to destroy democracy whilst we eradicate the disease. From here we must act carefully."
ENG_the_dirty_fellows_in_the_nf_desc:0 "The National Front is a political party descended from the Hardliner faction of the Royal Party before the split that saw United England emerge along with it. But something is wrong with those words, namely the implication that we need tolerate a party of open fascists existing in this new English democracy at all.\n\nIt is the pleasure of Prime Minister Maudling to announce that the fascists will no longer have free reign to act as a German catspaw. They will answer for what they have done and intended to do, and the people will love us for it."
ENG_outlaw_the_blackshirts_2_desc:0 "Banning fascism is a surprisingly simple process - a bill, a vote and a law which ends with a once dominant party of the English political landscape being rent asunder. The benefits of this action are many, but a surprising one is the change in the manner which the army views us.\n\nTraditionally the military establishment has always hated the ideology which ended the original United Kingdom decades ago. Now that we've banned fascism, some of the higher ranking officers are beginning to look at us, and not the Royal Party, as the political group with England's best interests in mind"
ENG_offer_the_fash_redemption_desc:0 "The National Front has many supporters, and given the efficacy of their propaganda during the years of Royal Party rule perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by this. Yet it is the young who worry us most, those who might potentially carry on the traditions of fascism in secret. We cannot answer this with force, lest we be proven to act like the tyrants the National Front claims us to be. No, we will offer the young and misguided opportunities to deradicalise. We won't be successful with everyone, but we will be successful enough to not worry about future problems."
ENG_the_people_know_better_desc:0 "Fittingly, the final say on fascism comes down to the people who voted them in. Some perhaps thought they were the only option, others maybe were intimidated into voting for the National Front, but there are always genuine supporters indoctrinated by ideology, and those are the real problem.\n\nWe need to address this at the base, convince them to abandon their hateful ideology in favour of a democracy that will do right by them, not the landlords and businessmen."
ENG_the_democratic_education_act_desc:0 "Despite our failures in fully dealing with the fascist problem, there yet remains a long term solution. People learn things best at a young age, and that is where we shall spread our message of democracy the most.\n\nThe Democratic Education Act will ensure that schools across the country address the realities of England's past and interactions with fascist nations and fascism itself. The crimes and corruption will be laid bare, their treachery revealed, their atrocities examined in exquisite detail. Let our children know the virtues of democracy, by seeing for themselves the alternative."
ENG_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc:0 "A rose will not bloom in a garden overgrown with weeds. The lingering tendrils of the old Collaborators' fascism and corporatism, hostile to the very idea of a diverse democratic polity, have been uprooted from England, leaving fertile soil for the democracy that we strive to become."
ENG_shake_it_up_a_little_desc:0 "Despite the fact that the Liberal faction of United England leads the party, the conservative Macmillanists still remain in overall power, and indeed recently they have begun to brook some of our reforms internally. This is intolerable, but there may yet be a solution that doesn't involve party infighting with a handful of old windbags.\n\nNamely, get rid of the windbags and put our people in their places. It won't please everyone but we don't need the figleaf of conservatism to protect us anymore, United England stands because of those who want change, not those who wish to prevent it."
ENG_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "First things first, we should address the matter of many United England MP's being, well, crotchety old men who were aging when the 2nd World War was going on let alone the Civil War. Old men having too much power for too long is half of what caused things to get this bad in the first place.\n\nNaturally, we cannot just remove MP's altogether but we can lessen their authority and the scope of their duties in cabinet, replacing the party whips would be a good start. The Macmillanists will rant and rave but in the end it is our party now, not theirs."
ENG_back_stab_the_conservatives_desc:0 "When you're about to do something terrible to a friend for their own good it's best to do it quickly and with minimum fuss. But for that we need lists, names and replacements all in order so the entire operation can be over in just 24 hours at the maximum.\n\nTo get those lists will be the job of our junior MP's, the ones below suspicion who will also be the ones filling in most of the positions about to suddenly become vacant. We want this to go off without a hitch, and that means planning."
ENG_hit_and_run_desc:0 "What we are about to do is not a kind act, it is not the act of friends who worked beside each other for years. History will not look upon this kindly, it will look upon it as necessary. In one meeting we will remove all the prominent Macmillanists from their posts, and appoint new, loyal Liberal members of the party in their stead.\n\nPerhaps one day they may forgive us, perhaps one day we may forgive ourselves."
ENG_approach_the_left_desc:0 "The Left Resistance represented the worst of the English leftist political spectrum, madmen and radicals who wanted a revolution of blood for a foolish cause. It is fitting they were mostly defeated along with that madman Stirling and the traitor Auchinleck.\n\nYet, political restrictions on the left don't merely extend to communists but to the old Labour remnants as well, who are unlikely to have done anything too treasonous. Perhaps if we offered them clemency, we might find allies more approachable to our reforms."
ENG_an_act_for_support_desc:0 "A simple piece of legislation it is, but the document sitting before Prime Minister Maudling is the single greatest leap forward for English politics in twenty years. It unbans the Labour party of old, should they be willing to renounce communism and revolutionary socialism that is.\n\nOnce returned, these leftist parties will cease causing civil difficulty for the government and offer their support to the stabilisation and maintenance of England's future. One good deed does not outway years of sins, but it is a start."
ENG_the_party_splits_desc:0 "Nobody can endure everything, and the last straw on the proverbial camel's back has broken for the Macmillanist conservative wing of United England. Our party once united is now unto two separate and distinct groups, but this time it is the Liberals who are the greater power of the two.\n\nWe have enough support that this will not overly affect our governance, perhaps we can even point to it as a demonstration of our commitment to the democracy we are busily restoring. It is a necessity, though a regrettable one."
ENG_the_new_magna_carta_desc:0 "If there's one thing Reginald Maudling can do well that none deny it's market something to the people. "The New Magna Carta" is no exception to this. Created in the bowels of our party headquarters, the document is actually a rather simple one for that it is talked up. What is nigh revolutionary about the document in the modern political era is that rather than increase the amount of governmental power certain offices possess, the New Magna Carta gives more power to the democratically elected offices. Both to Parliament, to the Judiciary and importantly to local councils."
ENG_helping_the_weak_desc:0 "The Royal Party is truly an insidious organisation, they don't merely rely on the old methods of currying favour with the voters but instead actively seek out downtrodden demographics and try to pin the blame for their situations on us. Ignoring the fact that they were in power for 20 years and caused most of the current problems.\n\nBut we must not lash out against the misguided, no, we must educate them instead. Heal them. Save them from what ailments they possess. Then they will know the truth of whom shall help whom."
ENG_the_RPs_abandonment_desc:0 "20 years of government. 20 years of promises. 20 years of failure. What can be said of the Royal Party really, besides the fact that they sold the nation to the wolves of Germany and grew fat off of the scraps of England's carcass.\n\nWhere was the Royal Party when the Germans searched through your homes? Where was the Royal Party when your children starved? Where were the Royal Party when they were shot! Standing at the beck and call of Germany, that's where."
ENG_the_missing_RP_desc:0 "The Royal Party now is a mockery of the very name. A party which hasn't been able to win either fair election it participated in, and has been reduced to a mockery in the newspapers. They lurk in the shadows, denying responsibility for their own mistakes and accusing us of crimes that were theirs. Never do they think of the people they could help, they think merely of power and of what they might do with it when it is seized. They disgust all decent minded people."
ENG_whats_in_the_RP_desc:0 "What of the membership of the Royal Party you ask? Why only the most ruthless band of criminals, crackpots and corrupt MP's this side of the English Channel. The moderates have been long weeded out by ruthless men, the few with any commitment to democracy absorbed into United England when it formed and fewer still into our own ranks.\n\nThere is no salvaging the poor souls who remain under the Royal name in the Houses of Parliament, no chance whatsoever."
ENG_the_RPs_secrets_desc:0 "If you want something to stick, find what they actually did and merely let logical conclusions do the rest. People won't believe a little lie, but if we don't directly say what it is we think the Royal Party did over the years it will have all the more poignant an effect.\n\nFor example, we know the Royal Party had the leaders of the 1953 uprising executed, who is to say that they didn't have other leaders perish in unfortunate circumstances? Or the corruption that we all know they partook in, perhaps all those ill paved roads could have used the funding? It is merely a thought."
ENG_the_final_step_in_democratization_desc:0 "Those parties which threatened democracy by their existence are no more, either reduced into nothing by virtue of what they did or banned outright. It is time then for us to create legitimate alternatives that the people might want to elect for the most trying possibility of all in democracy. That we might not get reelected.\n\nFor now, let us allow the resurrection of the old Labour Party. We can trust they appreciate the seriousness of the situation at any rate, and they hate fascism as much as the next man. They will do."
ENG_bring_back_old_labour_desc:0 "There was a time when it was bad to be labeled a liberal, let alone a leftist in England. Yet we promised those in hiding that the days of persecution were over. Now we have delivered on that and we can begin to see the flower of democracy fully unfold.\n\nLabour was many things, a rival and an opponent yes but never our enemy. We can trust them, we can work with them, and perhaps most importantly we know that should we lose to them next election they will not bring down this edifice we have created."
ENG_a_broken_but_perfect_system_desc:0 "We are not a perfect nation. Hard though it is to admit, we have poverty and corruption yes, even callousness of government on occasion. But we are a democracy. The people can sleep knowing they can judge us on merit rather than fear at the ballot box. For we are committed to their rights when all others are not.\n\nIt has taken many years to reach this point, but perhaps now is a better time than never. Long live Britain, and god save the King!"

ENG_IT_Macmillan_on_the_world_stage_desc:0 "England once again emerges onto the world stage. As a shadow of its former self. A nation no longer at the center of the world, no longer a dominant mover in world politics, but as a small nation making its first steps out from the shadows. One may expect England to be swamped by a turbulent sea of change and pulled back down into the depths. But England has been in this spot long ago, when the world was split between spheres of influence and a totalitarian dynasty ruled mainland Europe, and the tiny kingdom in the isles was an afterthought. And with some skillful maneuvering, one may find England as adept as it once was at claiming the spotlight.."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_new_england_desc:0 "Forget everything you know about England! A nation merely a puppet of the German Reich? No longer! The spineless traitors who bend over backwards to Hitler to protect their property and pompous titles? They lost the election! The fascists who serve only as Germany's boot on Britannia's neck? They now are further from power than anytime after the war!\n\nUnited England's England is a country that strongly abhors any sort of Nazism. It will go out and reclaim England's greatness, and forge bonds both new and old. No longer do we cower in the shadow of Adolf Hitler, for we now look the nations of the world right in the eyes!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_dealing_with_cornwall_desc:0 "Outside Bristol is a barbed wire scar that cuts through the country and separates England from the South West Peninsula. Beyond it is Cornwall, a humiliation forced upon us by the Germans, partially to keep us in line, but also to keep a segment of England in eternal torment. One can see a painful reminder of what once was, and what might be.\n\nBut we are not the England of 1943. And we are no longer a nation that needs to have a sword of Damocles dangled permanently over its head. We will eliminate the garrison, and then secure our eternal freedom."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_hurt_them_deep_desc:0 "Halder's forces have been a nuisance for a long time. Any dream the reformists had was shot down because of fears of the garrison. Any sensible reform the reformists proposed was blocked by fear of the garrison. And if the garrison had not been there, we would be a democracy right now, with the UE working side by side with Auchinleck. The garrison will be removed. Out of personal vendetta, yes. But also, to force the reeling Reich to look at us with respect or face the prospect of another landing under the white cliffs of Dover."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_ruin_their_supplies_desc:0 "Intelligence reports from the war showed the rebels oftentimes infiltrated the garrison territory to conduct sabotage and assassination missions against the troops there. These reports detailed tactics, operations and infiltration methods to do these missions. And a lot of these reports were never shown to our gallant allies in the garrison.\n\nLet's pick up where the rebels left off. Destroying warehouses, sabotaging fuel tanks, even robbing railroad cars will deprive the Germans of the necessary materials to wage war against us. We may not be able to do anything as spectacular as burn Plymouth off the face of the earth, but a long campaign of attrition will hurt the garrison just the same."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_strike_their_heart_desc:0 "For the longest time, the garrison has contributed immensely to the suffering of the English people. Their forces have kept the island under threat for years. They have run a piece of English territory like an eastern Reichskommisariat, punishing the good people who live there. And they have stifled any hope that the England of old could be made again.\n\nNow, they collect their reward for their services."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_regaining_our_freedom_desc:0 "The entire formation at Cornwall was eliminated, destroyed by the people and military it was supposed to threaten and coerce. One of the most feared forces of the Heer, led by its most famed generals, now completely destroyed. And England no longer is threatened by any immediate threat on the isles.\n\nThe world has been shown now that England must be taken seriously. It's forces can defeat the Germans in open battle once again. And it has severed all of its old chains and bonds with the Pakt. We stand as a country reborn, a nation that is going to assert its freedom against all comers. And that opens some doors that were once believed tightly shut..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_reaching_out_to_old_friends_desc:0 "The OFN has really been content to ignore us since the war ended. Or when they haven't ignored us, they've been providing guns to the communists and SAS. Now, the armed resistance has failed, and we have got the Germans off our back. Perhaps now is time for a reset in our relationship.\n\nWe will make clear we are the best chance England has now for a free future, one where people are no longer hounded by fascism, and have a high degree of liberty. We can be an extremely valuable member of the OFN, and slide into the role we once held when we were aligned together. It's time to make the calls."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_O'_Canada_desc:0 "Relations haven't been good with Canada lately. They refused to view us as anything other than a Nazi puppet state, which, let's be honest, we were. And our bondage prevented us from making any overtures to the Commonwealth. But now, we don't have the Huns on our back, so we can take advantage of this new state of affairs to rebuild our relationship with our oldest dominion. We can agree to an exchange of ambassadors and normalization of relations. Granted, our difference in monarchs may be an issue, but we do not seek to make them a colony again, only to have them see us as an equal on the world stage."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_cultural_exchange_desc:0 "Canada and the United Kingdom have long shared similar cultures to each other, as well as a fascination for the other's way of life. The war and occupation has temporarily stopped this cultural two-way, and we have gone off in a different direction than Canada has. Why not find out what the other is doing at the moment?\n\nWe must reintroduce the English culture to Canada. Their cities will host exhibitions by modern English artists. Their universities and libraries will be visited by English writers. And English musicians will tour their provinces. And we will gladly allow them to do the same. We will show them England is not in the cultural blight of fetishistic aryan depictions like the rest of Northern Europe. And they will show us that Canada's culture was not purchased by American movie and record studios."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_help_me_help_you_desc:0 "Have an excess of wheat? Ship it over here! Loggers out of work? We'll buy it from you! Want some workers to help with your factory? Why not build it here? Need help with your chemical plant? We have a few things I.G. Farben left behind in the war that might help you...\n\nBy helping Canada with a variety of problems, we can help them overcome the various challenges that they may face. And once they realize they need England, they will be sure to extend their thanks through improved diplomatic relations."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_our_greatest_ally_desc:0 "Throughout our history, we have seen many alliances of convenience take shape and dissolve through countless wars. One day, we align with the Spanish against the French, the next, we align with the French against the Spanish. Diplomacy is complicated, and oftentimes confusing. But in our recent history, when we were at our darkest moments, one country could be expected to come in and give their all against the enemies of freedom. And we must contact the United States to restore our grand alliance once more."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_the_propaganda_giant_desc:0 "America is a country with massive problems. Under the surface one will find a massive gap between rich and poor, rampant discrimination and racial violence, and a nation in permanent fear of being unable to defend itself from the Nazis or Japanese. Yet, you ask anyone outside the US what America is, and they will tell you it is a nation of tremendous opportunity, a melting pot of the cultures of the world, and a great protector of freedom. This is because for all the problems it has, America is tremendously good at selling itself on its good aspects.\n\nWe must set up some consultations with Maddison Avenue, Hollywood, and the State Department. If they can convince the world and their own people that America is so perfect and strong, perhaps they can apply their skills to England as well. With some makeup and good lighting, we can make England's problems disappear as well."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_closet_cooperation_desc:0 "We are friends of liberty. WE stand against fascism in all forms, and will do our utmost to protect the world from it. We will not forget our international commitments either. And with that, we shall cooperate with the ORganization of Free Nations. Our forces are ready to help the OFN where it needs it. Our diplomats will stand by the OFN when they must put pressure on other countries. And the OFN can be assured that one country in Europe stands by it in all things."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_the_land_down_under_desc:0 "Australia and New Zealand have been about as far from our minds since the war as they are from London. They have in the meantime cut many of their ties with the former British Empire and are mostly concerned with fending off any Japanese encroachments. Their situation does not involve us in any way, but we will be sure to improve relations with them regardless.\n\nIt's clear they want a reset relationship, and we will give them what they want. They want us to see them as an equal, and we expect them to treat us as the legitimate government of England. Once this is out of the way, we can get along just fine."
ENG_IT_a_simple_game_of_cricket_desc:0 "England and Australia need to begin to rebuild their relationship. One that's more equal and respectful. And isn't sports where respect is earned?\n\nFor a long time, The Ashes were a series of test cricket matches held between Australia and England. Restarting the series will give both England and Australia something to watch, and may improve our respective attitudes towards each other. Television will make these matches more popular than ever before. And we can pitch our country in-between the breaks."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_restoring_old_trade_ties_desc:0 "England has vast industrial potential and a highly skilled workforce. Oceana has wool, mutton, and an amazing amount of raw minerals. It makes sense that we start trading once again. They send us the raw materials that we need, and the ships bring back the finished products they love. Everyone makes money off of this, and both our economies will boom with this trade going on."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_part_of_something_bigger_desc:0 "No more can England be considered a glorified Reichskommisariat. No more do people talk to Germania when they want to talk to London. And no more are we considered a non-factor in world politics. Things have changed, and changed tremendously.\n\nWe have made our return to the world stage. The spotlight is on us. And the audience awaits our next lines. Now we strike the music and begin to perform."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_undermining_the_reich_desc:0 "For far too long, England has been a slave to Germany. A puppet, forced to endure poverty, humiliation, and hardship. And all for the benefit of a few stuck-up barbarians who think a shaky linguistic interpretation of Sanskrit makes them a world conquering master race. Well, their dominion over the English isles is at an end! Now, we begin to take moves that will free us from our bonds with the Hun."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_placating_the_reich_desc:0 "Calm yourself, Germany. We only want a better relationship with you. One that's more equal. We've taken care of ourselves, haven't we? While you and the rest of Greater Germany were losing your heads, we were able to hold onto our position. We do not need any more assistance to stand on our feet. And this certainly doesn't mean we want to rush off and join the OFN, we're still thankful for your guiding hand during those awful years after the war. Now, if you could turn your attention elsewhere for a bit, that would be much appreciated..."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_an_arms_deal_desc:0 "How do you show a nation you are committed to their foreign policy goals and are not a threat to them? By purchasing their arms, of course!\n\nWe will contact the Germans and ask if we can buy a bunch of their surplus weapons they no longer need after shooting the rest of the would-be Führers and their supporters. We don't really need the weaponry. But it can show we are acting in good faith, and improve Germania's opinion of us. It can also make Germany think we are potentially still their friend."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_visiting_the_overlord_desc:0 "A full Blitz of Germania is in order. One with aircraft taking off from England to disgorge their payloads on the city. And that payload is diplomats, ministers, officials, and various notables. Our delegation will contact everyone who is anyone in the city and convince them England is their friend. And this will calm tensions a lot. We certainly wish to continue our friendship of nations with mitteleuropa! Surely nobody can deny our sincerity?"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_becoming_our_own_desc:0 "It's time to slip off the chains that have held us to Germany for so long. No longer will we rely on German parts and equipment. Goods in Germany can be produced at home as well. And we don't need their experts anymore. Our economic needs will no longer tie us to the Pakt. Instead, we will now produce what we need by ourselves, further reducing Germany's hold over us."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_distancing_ourselves_from_germany_desc:0 "Our close association with Germany has caused...problems that we would rather not have. Domestically, the people see us as their overlords chosen by the Reich from a pile of Quislings. And the outside world still sees us as the administration of another Reichskommisariat that has gotten too pompous and self-centered. We should change this.\n\nGerman organizations will be quietly removed. Consulates from the Pakt will be closed down to the absolute minimum. And any other reminders of our past relationship will be destroyed or pushed out of sight. Germany is no longer our overlord, and we will make ourselves look like the independent nation we are."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_false_friendship_desc:0 "Hitler said England was not his natural enemy. That the Netherlands and the Belgians could continue to exist peacefully. And that he desired nothing more than peace with his European neighbors. Some believed him. But one does not need any more evidence of the falseness of those statements.\n\nWe say Germany is our friend as well. They believe it. But our words are complete dross. We merely pretend to be their friends to prevent them from taking aggressive action against us. And one day, we might plunge the knife into their back, just like they did for so many others.."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_but_a_profitable_one_desc:0 "Our past history with the Reich has been... troubled, but that does not change the fact that they are not only the largest economy on the Continent, but also wield control over practically all the other economies of the same landmass, with partial exception of the former Triumvirate members. As much as our citizens on the streets may object to and be suspicion of any interaction with the Germans beyond that strictly necessary to maintain the integrity and security of our nation, almost all our economists and business leaders are of one mind. We must open for and encourage trade with the Reich and its puppets if English productive forces are to thrive. The Reichsmark may be covered in blood, but that does not make its value less when exchanged for shiny new Pound sterling."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_our_independence_secured_desc:0 "The days of empire are long past, and yet English ambassadors find that their calls to Washington and Germania are answered increasingly frequently. Our country's strategic position off of Europe's shore, while putting at risk from the Reich on the Continent and the Americans in Iceland, also presents us with a diplomatic opportunity. The Americans and the Germans want the honor of dancing with England alone; by dancing with both of them, we will remind them that England is a nation that deserves respect."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_bringing_wales_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The first nation on the Isles to be conquered by the ascendant Kingdom of England in the medieval age, Wales has long detested our supremacy, mounting a strong resistance against us - first through petty kings and rebellions, and then peaceful agitation. Unionist elements in Welsh society still exist, however, and they may be the key to peaceful unification. England and Wales will once again be one - this time hopefully without bloodshed."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_beginning_the_process_desc:0 "The Welsh have accepted our overtures! The path to peace and friendship between our nations lies open, and the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. We are one step closer towards the reunification of Great Britain and a resurgent United Kingdom!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_forcing_them_back_in_desc:0 "The Welsh, in their misguided pride and stubbornness, have rejected our offer. Unfortunately for them, we do not accept refusal. Great Britain will be whole again - and sacrifices must be made for it to happen."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_with_us_once_again_desc:0 "We have done it - Wales is back in the fold, and our goal of uniting the errant former kingdoms of Britain is nearly within our grasp. Welcome back, Welshmen! We are together once again."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_making_it_official_desc:0 "Even though Wales is, de facto, under our control, technically our nations are still separate. The reunification has made quite a legal mess, and we must sort it out before proceeding further - which is why we shall proclaim the Kingdom of England-Wales, standing proud and mighty for all the world to see!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_reunite_with_survivors_desc:0 "When the Huns crossed the channel and set foot upon our fair land, the British Army resisted them on every step of the way. They fought on the beaches, on the landing grounds, in the fields and in the streets, they fought in the hills, and even though they were pushed out of England, they held the line in the north, in Scotland, and they never, ever surrendered.\n\nNow, as the German yoke no longer rests on the English neck, we shall welcome them back, one and all."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_quiet_unification_desc:0 "The situation has developed just as we had hoped - the Scottish government has accepted our offer. There will be no more bloodshed, no more pain - our heroes are coming back home, and all of Scotland with them."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_a_loud_refusal_desc:0 "We didn't think it would come to this, but reality has surprised us once again - Scotland will not return under the King's reign peacefully. We can speculate on what, or who, made them do this - socialists, foreign agents, nationalist agitators... In the end, it matters not.\n\nScotland will not last."
ENG_IT_Macmillan_together_at_last_desc:0 "As Edinburgh passes from the control of separatists and nationalists into our own hands, the United Kingdom, considered by many to be dead and forever lost to the annals of history, rises anew. Peace returns to the long-suffering island, one built to last. We have proven to all that Britain, however beaten and battered, still has enough strength to stand on its own!"
ENG_IT_Macmillan_breaking_them_down_desc:0 "Nationalist, socialist and other traitorous elements of Scottish society still seem to resist our benevolent rule. They attack our soldiers, loot the cities and terrify our citizens. Their terrorist actions endanger the King's peace, and cannot be tolerated!"

ENG_the_new_british_royal_armed_forces_desc:0 "Nobody is really prepared for a massive insurrection, especially one where a sizable number of our units and officers defect. Our men were forced to fight a difficult campaign against their own countrymen, who were armed and supported by major foreign powers. That we won in the end is a significant credit to the armed forces of England, but none of this excuses poor performance.\n\nWe may not want to hear it, but we underperformed in the Civil War. We will find out what went wrong, and fix it immediately. Our next enemy will not be a group of insurgents. And we cannot make mistakes when we face him."
ENG_consult_the_generals_desc:0 "The English Army has now been divided into two distinct doctrinal camps, both of which insist their strategy is the best to defend England is the best way to prevent a German incursion. As always, we really can only support one.\n\nOne faction of the Armed Forces insists a strategy of intense fortification is the way to fend off an invasion. By wearing the Germans down, they say, we would make the cost of an attack on England too much for the Reich. This is folly, say the others. England alone cannot withstand an invasion, we must seek aid from the OFN instead and get their help in our defense.\n\nMany have reservations about working with the ones who supported the rebels just a short while ago, but others say we do not have a choice in the matter."
ENG_never_another_sealion_desc:0 "The most shameful moment in the history of Britain came in 1943, when the first Fallschirmjäger boots touched English soil near Brighton. What came next were years of destruction, humiliation, shame, slavery, and death. We now know the consequences of defeat, and not a man in England will stand for such a disaster again.\n\nEngland held off invaders for 866 years before Sealion. We resolve to do much better than that this time around."
ENG_lessons_from_1943_desc:0 "The largest navy in the world. An air force backed by advanced radar and Spitfires. A massive army using everything at its disposal and multiple lines of permanent fortifications. And the Germans still won. For years, a victimized island has asked "why?"\n\nWell, we'll figure out "why." We're going to get a team together to look through all the documentation of what happened in those fateful months, from British and German sources. We'll figure out just what went wrong, and where those weak links were. They won't be there next time, that's for damn sure."
ENG_a_smaller_but_better_force_desc:0 "The Army won't like it, but it's really the truth. We shouldn't put our efforts into making a massive and bloated defense force made up of every man in England. Rather, we should put our efforts towards making sure our military is as trained and equipped as possible. Our goal isn't to match the Huns on a manpower basis, it's to surpass them on a man-to-man basis. If our soldiers know what they're doing, and they have the tools to do it, it will make them as effective as a force ten times their number. And having a massive amount of fortifications to rely on will help them tremendously as well."
ENG_train_more_reservists_desc:0 "It's simple math, really. The Germans are going to be coming in with large numbers of men. If we don't put up a respectable number of men against them, we lose, and we don't have a respectable number of men to put against them.\n\nReservists must be called up and trained, and the manpower pool will be increased. Everybody that can do the grim task of defending our island from the enemy is going to do so. England expects that every man will do his duty, and they will."
ENG_defend_every_piece_of_land_desc:0 "Let us make it clear to the German that this is not the 1940s, and we are not some Eastern European agrarian backwater. This is England, where we stand ready to defend our land, and have the capabilities to back it up. Every schoolchild can recall our centuries of military triumphs, and we intend to wipe away the shame of 1943 with the blood of Nazi Fallschirmjägers and infantrymen.\n\nEvery beach will have a pillbox. Every field will be guarded by a machine gun nest. Every street will have an AT emplacement at the end of it. Every home will have a squad in it, and every barn will have a sniper in the hayloft. Any advance will take a heavy toll, and we'll see how many lives the Germans will now spend to take our island again."
ENG_strategic_redoubts_desc:0 "The concept of fixed defensive lines is something from the First World War, and quite honestly should stay there. Our defensive fortifications are not going to be thin rings of bunkers and barbed wire across the countryside. As Friedrich the Great once said, "he who defends everything defends nothing."\n\nRather, we will allow the Germans to make advances in select areas of England. The army hates the very idea, but it allows our forces to make stands in more defendable and extremely fortified locations. From there, they can hold off the Germans and make counter attacks as part of a mobile defense strategy."
ENG_simulate_an_invasion_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we are unable to enlist the help of the Wehrmacht in doing a version of their invasion to test our defences. Fortunately, we can do the next best thing. With our knowledge of German tactics and good estimates of their numbers, we can simulate their invasion in an exercise. Computers will help control for variability and other effects.\n\nThe aim of this war game is to test our strategies against an actual invasion. We will see any major flaws in our strategy, so we can correct them. Any successes will be noted as well, especially ones that we did not expect. With our pretend invasion, we will be much more ready for the real thing."
ENG_blow_up_the_panzers_desc:0 "Germany's strength is in their mechanized beasts. They stormed across Europe, sowing death and destruction wherever they went. Our Home Guard had scarcely any defense except jamming logs in their tracks and trying to pour sugar in their gas tanks. This was ineffective, and in many cases suicidal. To make it even worse, the new versions of the Panzers are more armored, better armed, and larger than any model we faced in the invasion.\n\nBut instead of immobilizing, what if we destroy them instead? It certainly is a concept worth putting effort into."
ENG_fortify_the_coasts_desc:0 "Knowing where your enemy is coming from is an incalculable advantage in a fight, and we know where the Germans are coming from; they're coming from the sea. This is a broad front, sure, but it means we can concentrate our efforts in defending a few critical areas and ports to prevent the enemy from sustaining a foothold.\n\nA series of barbed wire, land mines, and just plain fortifications are to be built across the coastline. These will offer our soldiers defendable positions to dig into and protection against enemy fire support. Sure, it sort of ruins the scenery, but we won't be able to enjoy England at all if it's under the jackboot."
ENG_radars_in_the_southeast_desc:0 "In this fight, we need every advantage that can be seized by us. We can create as many tactical and strategic advantages on England as we could, but there is still more that needs to be done. We must know the enemy, and not just be able to match him on paper.\n\nA series of radar stations in the southeast served our nation well in the last war, and they will be expanded in this one. We will see the enemy ships before they ever sight English soil. We will know when a flight of aircraft is coming to attack us well before they arrive over England, and we can listen to the enemy units from far away. When they attack, we will know, and we will be ready to meet them."
ENG_keeping_the_skies_clean_desc:0 "We will never be able to match the Luftwaffe in the air. That's a sad fact, but it's the truth. We lack the aircraft and pilots necessary to stop the enemy from coming over the countryside and attacking where they want. They still have to come over, and so we can make it hard for them.\n\nA series of anti-aircraft batteries unlike anywhere else in the world will make any journey over England fraught with danger. Cannons and missiles await at every potential target and over every route to it. If they want to attack, they have to face these defenses. If they want to neutralize these batteries, they still need to attack. If they don't attack, they cannot win."
ENG_one_step_ahead_of_them_desc:0 "Something we English have always prided ourselves on is our intelligence system. We have placed a premium on finding out all we can about our enemies. Today is no different. MI6 must have people everywhere, throughout the Pakt, in order to find out what we can about an invasion.\n\nOur agents will give us everything we need. They will give us the codes and radio frequencies. They will give us the order of battle. They will give us the plans of the invasion force, and they will give us what's most valuable of all: a date."
ENG_work_with_the_ofn_desc:0 "Some won't admit it, but there is only one force in the world that can provide the necessary force to counter the German Reich. The Americans and their allies have the factories, they have the knowledge, and they have the technology to fight a war against the Hun. We do not.\n\nWe don't expect the Americans to trust us at first. They really have no reason to right now, since we defeated their proxy army a short while ago, but we can earn their trust by showing some of our own. We will offer to work together to show that we are serious about opposing the Reich's designs on our island. In time, they will come to see why our England fights for their cause as well."
ENG_meet_up_with_them_desc:0 "Getting into contact with the United States won't be easy. They have tended to ignore our government, and so have the rest of the OFN. This makes any direct contact with the American president impossible. However, there are some countries that are on speaking terms with us and the OFN, and also have an interest in making sure Germany's plans are frustrated.\n\nWe can send a diplomat to make contact with an American counterpart in a neutral ground, and have him inform the OFN of what we would like them to do. It'll be a tense, awkward conversation. If we can manage to have it, then we can convince them our needs align."
ENG_american_equipment_desc:0 "Everyone can agree that American military equipment is quite splendid. Everyone likes their tanks and infantry equipment, and agree their aircraft are some of the best in the world. Even better, we can get our hands on a bunch of it.\n\nAmerica will send us shipments of material for us to use against the Germans, with the hope we use it well. Some of it is surplus from the last war, but a lot of it is high-tech cutting-edge weaponry that our men will be pleased to use. The Army loves this idea, and will gladly outfit our forces with these weapons."
ENG_american_blueprints_desc:0 "American equipment is all well and good, but is it for the English soldier? We can't rely on foreign suppliers to keep our forces outfitted and supplied. With some technical help, we can guarantee that American weaponry with British characteristics will be used instead.\n\nThe US will send us the necessary blueprints to use for our defense industry, and to improve our domestically-produced weapons. Our generals may be disappointed in this, but British soldiers must have British equipment. The potential benefit to our national arms industry is enormous."
ENG_a_new_way_of_warfare_desc:0 "War has changed since the 1940's. Today's troops move faster, and have far more firepower at their disposal than they did back then. Now that our armed forces are unshackled, we need to catch up to the outside world, and our new friends can give us the skills to do it.\n\nMany books and reports on the recent, mobile actions in South Africa have been written in the United States, and are available in American military schools, and the State Department has agreed to give us their library card. These papers will go to Sandhurst, and every officer will be required to read about these developments, and to have familiarity with how things work in the wars of the present day."
ENG_lessons_from_the_empire_desc:0 "The deserts of Arabia. The jungles of Tanzania. The mountains of the Spīn Ghar. All terrains much harsher than one would find in Britain, and all places where the British Empire fought and won in living memory.\n\nOur empire gave us skills in handling the most extreme types of terrain. There still are men who remember the challenges and hardships these terrains pose, and the solutions they found to keep muddling through. Their knowledge of the worst the world threw at them will help our young men deal with the worst the island can throw at them."
ENG_a_pact_with_the_ofn_desc:0 "We need to recognize that Britain and the OFN have similar needs. We need American technology and equipment. They need bases from which they can get really up close and personal with Germany. Why not help each other?\n\nThey guarantee technology sharing and the occasional delivery of spare equipment for our forces. We can guarantee them bases for their men, and naval facilities to operate from. Everybody gets what they want, and it makes us all very happy. Let's see if they'll agree to this treaty."
ENG_ofn_naval_exercise_desc:0 "It's a sad state of affairs when Britain is not at the cutting edge of naval warfare. Feelings aside, we must recognize where we are. We need to do what is necessary to turn things around and get us back on top.\n\nThe OFN has offered to bring along some of our officers on a naval exercise in the Atlantic. Our men will watch the OFN practice the latest techniques in all aspects of naval warfare. They will bring back their observations and what they learned. This will help us catch up with the aspects of modern naval combat."
ENG_spy_on_the_germans_desc:0 "Of course, we aren't going to forget about the real threat to our country. They are nearby, and we can watch them prepare for the day they attempt to destroy us. However, their proximity and our intelligence apparatus give us a great opportunity to build rapport with the OFN.\n\nMI6 will begin sharing what we learn about Germany with the CIA. They will also feel free to request intelligence that we hold on the Third Reich. Our services will make us invaluable to the United States, and their capabilities will help MI6 in turn."
ENG_airbases_in_the_southeast_desc:0 "When we started planning our air defences in Southern England, we noticed a problem. Many of the airfields were good for the aircraft flying there the last time they were operational, but some experts from the United States believe they are woefully inadequate. For example, F110s and B-52s require longer runways than the P-51s and B-17s did. If we are to operate American aircraft on these fields, massive modernization must take place.\n\nWe will correct this oversight immediately. Construction will begin on longer runways and bigger hangers so we can have airfields that meet the standards for American aircraft. Our goal is to make the area as much a home for American aircraft as it was back during the war."
ENG_a_british_U2_desc:0 "In the last war, our pilots loved the de Havilland Mosquito as a reconnaissance platform. Fast, agile, and good at just about anything you could make it do, it was perfect for sneaking over enemy territory undetected and running off with valuable photos. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to work on something better. Thus, we aren't surprised when the Americans tell us their U-2 can travel higher, faster, and longer.\n\nThe Americans will lend us experts to help develop a U-2 that we can produce domestically and use to gather intelligence. If we end up with anything close to the performance of the U-2 and the value of the Mosquito, we will consider our model a smashing success."
ENG_american_advisors_desc:0 "Among other things the Germans were bad at, they failed to properly help out our military with advisors. It seems they just wanted us to soak up enough Scottish machine gun fire until the Ubermensch could stroll through and win the day. Thus, we have had to rely on our own knowledge to keep our military in shape. The Americans are a lot more generous, however.\n\nUS Army officers will be embedded with our units to provide advice and best practices. Specifically, they will make sure our men are well drilled, our forces are disciplined, and our military efficiency is up to snuff. With their outsider perspective, we can make the British armed forces meet world class standards."
ENG_a_new_royal_navy_desc:0 "Drake's defenders of the Gravelines. Nelson's heroes of Trafalgar. Jellicoe's victors of the Jutland. A group of rusted hulks in the estuary.

We're not going to just hope they sink another Lusitania or Reuben James.\n\nASW ships and destroyers will guard our convoys in the North Atlantic.

Yet the collapse of the German economy dealt a blow to the fragile status quo from which it almost could not recover, we were left with massive debts and little way to effectively fund many of our vaunted institutions.

Under UE leadership England will move forwards, unemployment will be lowered and the economy made strong once more. From London to Carlisle, England shall know neither poverty or decay, for what use is responsibility if it is not exercised?"
ENG_ET_macmillan_a_job_for_every_englishman:0 "A Job for Every Englishman"
ENG_ET_macmillan_a_job_for_every_englishman_desc:0 "Throughout the decades of Royal Party leadership, every attempt to figure out how to fix the problems that England faced failed. Whilst it is easy to blame the times, we cannot forget that due to their nature and makeup the Royal Party in many respects simply doesn't understand what the average Englishman wants.\n\nWhat use is glory for a hungry stomach, or prestige for the university educated working odd jobs to make ends meet? What care they for claims of traitors in their midst when weeks of looking for work turn out to be fruitless? Every Englishman shall have a job should he desire it, if more are needed then thats what the government shall create one way or another. Macmillan has shown us the way, and United England shall follow."
ENG_ET_macmillan_no_more_discrimination:0 "No More Discrimination"
ENG_ET_macmillan_no_more_discrimination_desc:0 "Britain, many people forget, was nominally a union, but the unequal treatment of her constituent parts is why she fell to pieces when pressed where other nations strove onwards. Under Macmillan, England will not make that mistake. Regardless of religion, race, or gender, nobody should be forced to stand by and do nothing when discriminated against. We are not the barbaric Germans, heads filled with outdated ideas of racial superiority and chauvinism. This is England, a nation where every man and woman alike will have a shot at success.\n\nOn a more practical note, discrimination on the basis of gender and race in particular negatively effect out economy as otherwise capable individuals are forced against their will to contribute less. Such primitive notions of superiority must be dismantled posthaste."

ENG_ET_macmillan_an_end_to_nepotism_desc:0 "Nepotism is a blight upon any nation seeking responsible and stable government, like a parasite it saps away at talent in favour of those born to the "right" people, and in England it is worryingly pervasive. We tolerate some degree of nepotism because it is the way of the world, but the kind all too often indulged in by the Royal Party has attached itself to the government like a disease. We must snuff it out.\n\nWe will give everyone fair warning. From today on, there will be no more favour-exchanging, no more saving-jobs-for-friends, or else there will be hell to pay. There will be some who think us making a publicity stunt like the Royal Party occasionally did. They will find themselves most grievously mistaken, and their trials will send a message to the rest to fall in line."
ENG_ET_macmillan_the_women_workforce_act:0 "The Women in the Workforce Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_the_women_workforce_act_desc:0 "English women have continually left their mark on history over the centuries, our greatest monarch is even to this day undoubtedly Queen Victoria and few deny the glories of Queen Elizabeth in the 1500's. Why then should women be forced to work only the most menial of jobs for little pay or security? It's barbaric and too German for United England's liking.\n\nThe Women Workforce Act is a project that has been worked upon for several years now, a comprehensive piece of legislation that will forbid discrimination against workers on the basis of sex and forbid pay differentials between men and women for the same work. This will, hopefully, encourage women to be more active in the workforce, whilst also guaranteeing them protection. With any luck we'll have some unsavoury individuals dumb enough to test the words of this act as well. Examples are stunningly useful to force compliance."

ENG_ET_macmillan_the_right_reforms_desc:0 "You can never be too careful when changing delicate systems, and what system is more delicate than that of society itself? We in United England are not so aloof that we cannot recognise when aspects of society must be adjusted to better provide for the welfare of all involved, and hence Macmillan has outlined a series of carefully planned changes to be made nationwide over the coming months.\n\nTitled, "The Right Reforms" and marketed as the government granting rights which should always have been present, were it not for the interference of the Germans and the fascist incompetents of prior governments. With the reforms in place, our economy will hopefully improve in response. Certainly, England could use it."

ENG_ET_macmillan_fair_employment_act_desc:0 "Those members of society who are disabled in mind or body are not the worthless wretches the more callous members of the opposition would like to portray them as. Amputees, the blind, and the deaf, can all be made into functioning members of the workforce if they are only given some basic assistance. We shall create an agency for this purpose with an England-wide mandate.\n\nAdditionally, the act can cover more general situations where the employer could and in some unfortunate cases has taken advantage of their employees due to the power they hold over them. This act should address this and additionally forbid employees from being fired solely at the whim of the employer. Never let it be said United England does not care for the helpless."

ENG_ET_macmillan_the_labour_act_desc:0 "The working man is one of the core personages of England, for without them who would keep our mighty industry running and our buildings from falling down? It is only right therefore that our government enshrine some protections for the employees of all businesses, government and civilian alike in law rather than mere words alone.\n\nFrom this day forwards, the workers of England shall have a respectable minimum wage, cannot be forced to work beyond a certain number of hours without overtime and will have the right to take complaints against their employer on the subject of ill treatment or unjust firing to a commission. We shall also implement a more stringent series of workplace health and safety laws, combined these endeavours should greatly improve the lives of the average Englishman."

ENG_ET_macmillan_the_workers_health_act_desc:0 "A national healthcare service, as first suggested in the Beveridge Report so long ago during the Second World War, has been a promised benefit of the Royal Party for some decades now. Yet they never delivered, and so an opportunity arises for United England to make our own mark upon the histories.\n\nThe Workers Health Act will provide covered hospital fees for all private hospitals and selected clinics across the nation for all persons without private health insurance. We cannot cover everything or every eventuality, but this basic service will quite literally save tens of thousands of lives over time. Should we implement it well, this Act will seal our immortality in the people's minds forever."

He has through will and dealing led a Liberal resurgence through the United England party that most thought impossible after two decades of Royal Party domination. Now that he has proper influence over the matter of the economy however, he has some changes to make.\n\nThe economy is an ever changing, ever shifting morass of opportunity and the possibility of failure. Traditionally the goal was to ride the currents as best as the individual could, but now that a moral man leads England, it shall be the goal of the government to ride the tides for the good of all. A dawn rises, and it is a Liberal one that will provide salvation to all the people of England."
ENG_ET_macmillan_fair_education:0 "Fair Education"
ENG_ET_macmillan_fair_education_desc:0 ""Fair Education" A saying which is often headlined by the Maudling Government but rarely explained in detail. Well the time has come to actually get to the process of implementing the ideal, the basics of the proposal focus around lowering the cost of educating for the average Englishman and providing bonuses to higher education institutions for the training of more teachers of all varieties. In addition the Maudling government will sponsor the building of several dozen new public schools across England, to better offer the chance for our nation to improve academically.\n\nThe average person might not see much personal benefit immediately, but their children will grow up in an England where basic education is free, and perhaps that alone is worth all the effort."
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_education_costs:0 "The Lower Education Costs Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_education_costs_desc:0 "The Government has sent out the draft for an act set to pass Parliament sometime in the next few weeks, titled the "Lower Education Costs Act", LECA is a plan by the government to divert a substantial amount of funding to all aspects of education, effectively subsidising them in return for making their prices to the general populace substantially lower. For families who never sent their children to any school, let alone secondary or tertiary education this could make all the difference in the world.\n\nSome observers have noted however that nowhere within the text of the act is it stated "where" these funds shall come from. This has caused some degree of discontent, but most are confident in the Prime Ministers ability that they have made little fuss in public."
ENG_ET_macmillan_it_will_pay_in_the_future:0 "It will Pay Out in the Future"
ENG_ET_macmillan_it_will_pay_in_the_future_desc:0 "The Royal Party, in their typical ignorance, question the wisdom of spending so great an amount on public education. What they really mean to ask is why we should give the "filthy commoners" the education that they will require to better themselves.\n\nThe answer is simple, plant no seeds in a field and you will have no control over what or how much you receive from it. Plant the seeds you want in the field, nurture and water them and you will reap the benefits from it for a lifetime and then some. The children of this generation are England's future, it's time we started treating them with the care they deserve rather than dismissing them for their birth or natural abilities. Maybe one day the next Einstein shall be English."
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_taxation:0 "Fair Taxation"
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_taxation_desc:0 "Do we really need to tax the poor so much? They don't actually own too great a percentage of the national wealth, most of which sits holed up in land value and the vaults of the aristocracy. We could cut some taxes on the more innovative businesses as well whilst we're at it, really help the English entrepreneurial spirit get going.\n\nThis shan't be so popular with some portions of our own party let alone the opposition, but what is the position of Prime Minister for if not to push through what needs to be done rather than sitting around and waiting for gold to fall from the sky? The people will thank us for sure, and is that not what matters when it comes time for elections?"
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_income_tax:0 "Lower Income Tax Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_lower_income_tax_desc:0 "The Income Tax has always been one of the more divisive aspects of English national policy, yes it works for generating revenue but the argument has been put forth that it stifles investment to some degree as well. United England cannot simply abolish the Income Tax nor do we wish to, but there are more ways than one to skin the proverbial cat\n\nIf we reduce the Income Tax rate but only for the poorer elements of society and the richer persons who make a certain amount of investment in the economy over the course of the financial year we could well gain some popularity from the policy without betraying the principles it embodies. The business community will likely complain at first but they will see the light in time."
ENG_ET_macmillan_trade_will_pay:0 "We Will Pay it Through trade"
ENG_ET_macmillan_trade_will_pay_desc:0 "Trade, trade is the lifeblood of England and, if the new taxation policies are implemented as stated it will quite likely be our main source of governmental funds as well. Foreign companies are chewing their hair at the possibility of missing out upon the English markets, and all we have to do to get them to contribute to our society is threaten to tax their ventures into the ground.\n\nMost of the time we wouldn't be making this threat openly of course, no it is a far more practical matter to simply leave the threat hanging. By doing this we stand to make more than a high income tax ever would in a hundred years, and we'll give the English people more jobs out of the deal to boot. It is a good day to be an Englishmen, yes indeed."
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_labour:0 "Modern Labour"
ENG_ET_macmillan_liberal_labour_desc:0 "Manual labour is a backbreaking task, somewhat literally in all too many unfortunate cases. Our economy once relied upon that sort of work, but now in the modern age we are beginning the transition to something greater, something better. The manufacturing of advanced materials and goods, services like banking and trading materials all across the globe. We even hold a surprising headstart in the production of materials used in computers.\n\nEngland moves forward with the times and shall never be stuck in the past where lords and the upper class ruled over all. Let them have their land and titles, they'll have nought else soon enough."
ENG_ET_macmillan_maudling_labour_act:0 "The Liberal Labour Act"
ENG_ET_macmillan_maudling_labour_act_desc:0 "The "Liberal Labour Act" is a piece of legislation designed to aid England in better exploiting the circumstances we find ourselves in. When the mines are making less money than ever and most of our income once more comes from trading across the globe as we did in the height of the Empire.\n\nThe Act will when put into effect subsidise foreign companies seeking to invest in our markets and subsidise further the English companies looking to build foreign connections. With this Act we shall create enough jobs for the majority of our remaining unemployment to if not go away entirely then at least be mitigated significantly. It'll even be competitive, a truly modern masterpiece of business and care. The people however, will be the ones who get the profits."
ENG_ET_macmillan_looking_to_the_left:0 "Looking to the Left"
ENG_ET_macmillan_looking_to_the_left_desc:0 "The Left was once in the political doghouse under the Royal Party, but with United England growing steadily more liberal the once outsiders seem remarkably decent allies in the current circumstances.\n\nIf we throw in a few passages about granting more workers rights and cracking down on abuses of power by bosses we can probably get the newly reformed leftist parties onside outright. Having allies on all sides makes it far easier to pass legislation than being limited to those we cannot fully trust after all. We should be careful to not grow too reliant though, hobbled from the once mighty powerhouse of Labour the current leftist parties might be, but by no means does that make them any less dangerous should we double cross them on something important."
ENG_ET_macmillan_a_liberal_economy:0 "A Liberal Economy"
ENG_ET_macmillan_a_liberal_economy_desc:0 ""Liberal", once a term derided by the Royal Party but nurtured in secret and kept alive despite efforts to crack down upon us. Well now we stand at the precipice of a new era, a Liberal era of peace and most especially prosperity.\n\nThe people and the businesses have never had it better, nor for that matter have the upper classes though they'd never say it outloud. A Liberal Economy for a Liberal nation that if we are fortunate will continue long after our own bones are nought but dust in some dingy crypts. For this we must thank Macmillan as well, for without him we'd have never gotten this far, perhaps one day the world will know the full story. For now though, let us relax in the glorious future which awaits our children, a Liberal future."

ENG_PT_thatcher_a_young_face_for_an_old_system_desc:0 "The English people have rejected stagnation and lunacy in favor of victory! Victory for themselves, victory for their nation... and victory for us.\n\nThe history books will doubtless describe Margaret Thatcher as the first female Prime Minister, but that alone cannot be her legacy. Many refuse to place their trust in a young woman, even one as tenacious as Thatcher, but it is time for drastic change. The stuffy old men who reject leadership shall be left behind in the dirt as the Royal Party hauls England to greater heights. Soon, Thatcher will be a figure of authority for all the world to see."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_ladys_speech_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher must face the English people not as a candidate, but as a Member of Parliament, as the leader of the Royal Party, and most importantly as their Prime Minister. She is to deliver a steely yet brief speech before the black door of 10 Downing Street as the press scramble to take pictures and hurl questions. It is not just the English but the whole world who will witness this speech – and as she well knows, first impressions are the most important."
ENG_PT_thatcher_edward_abdicates_desc:0 "The recent elections were surprising in many ways, not least that they occurred at all. But both our politicians and our populace believed that would be the end of surprises as far as they year went. It would seem that asking for calm is pointless however as our government has just received a rather alarming phone call.\n\nHis Majesty Edward VIII of the House of Windsor, King of England, has abdicated effective immediately. It is easy enough to understand why he did this, aside from being a man of weak political skills and hated by a rather significant percentage of the population, His Majesty could conceivably be held to be at fault for the events of the recent Civil War to some degree. When that is your legacy is it any wonder a man loses the desire to rule?"
ENG_PT_thatcher_king_henry_takes_the_throne_desc:0 "Edward's abdication does leave us in a bit of a pickle in regards to whom the next monarch shall actually be, the former King having no heir of his own blood. Obviously the American puppet Elizabeth cannot be allowed to accede to the throne, but there is yet one Windsor from the children of George V left untainted by incompetence.\n\nHenry the Duke of Gloucester has remained out of the political spotlight for the past decades, ignoring both our and his niece's government in favor of charity work. He is our only legitimate successor to Edward VIII, and though he might dislike the idea of becoming monarch, we can remind him of all the strife England might avoid if he did his duty. The former King aside, the Windsors are a reliable family after all."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_crown_falls_silent_desc:0 "It seems that England cannot catch a break on the matter of its Kings. Whilst travelling back from a charity function, His Majesty Henry IX suffered a debilitating stroke that has rendered him bedridden. Despite our hopes, doctors have informed us that the King will leave hospital care as a quadriplegic - hardly in any condition to rule the country!\n\nThis is a disastrous situation, but as a nation we are capable of recovering from it. Our first action now should be to decide who shall act as His Majesty's regent, and from there consult the line of succession. If our current luck holds, we will be in need of its guidance sooner rather than later."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_prince_regent_desc:0 "William the Prince of Wales is a rather sensible lad. Young but not overly so, and more importantly agrees with us on the matter of England's ideal government - to a greater degree than his incapacitated father, even. This is good, as the Prince will assume his position relatively soon.\n\nFor now however, William of the House of Windsor will simply act as Prince-Regent of England, primarily substituting for His Majesty in his supposed appearances within England and without. We ought to be thankful to some extent; regency will help immeasurably in acquainting the young prince with the duties of a king."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_king_is_dead_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "King Henry IX, a noble man of strength, virtue, determination and duty shunned by most, has breathed his last. With his death marks the passing of His Majesty George V's last child, furthermore prompting the accession of England's seventh monarch this century.\n\nAll Hail King William V, who has borne the duties and burdens of the Crown. Only a strong hand can marshal the nation's strength in these troubling times, and the new King will assist our government in keeping such will at our policies' forefronts. Fortune willing, he shall reign for many decades yet - perhaps even reign over Britain reborn. But whatever changes the world's turning shall brook, England shall forever shout:\n"God save the King!""
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_discord_may_we_bring_harmony_desc:0 "The upper echelons of society have had strong ties to the Royal Party since before the tragedy that was the English Civil War.

Perhaps it is time we weighed our options..."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_speech_blitz_in_london_desc:0 "Many still believe that public oration is a task fit only for a male, booming voice. To put paid to this laughable assertion, Prime Minister Thatcher will sweep London with a blitz of speeches aimed at the country's elite and privileged. Royalists, aristocrats, giants of industry... the Iron Lady's own voice will make sure they understand her own government's place for them."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_aristocrats_know_nothing_about_england_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher has decided to unleash her inner populist. The Prime Minister will begin to challenge the elite of the nation, accusing them of engaging in corruption and harboring disdain for the average citizen. While the Royal Party will protest against this rhetorical direction, it is a message for the people – and the people will hear it."
ENG_PT_thatcher_and_who_are_you_that_i_must_bow_so_low_desc:0 "In a move certain to infuriate the upper ranks of the Royal Party, Thatcher will openly attack powerful members thereof with strong ties to the government. The common people will love this, viewing it as a brave stance against elitism and the influence of unelected figures in our broken system. It will be a display of loyalty towards the citizens, and spite towards the elite."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_workplace_corruption_act_desc:0 "As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. If the people are to be convinced of our populist struggle against the elite, we must prove that we are willing to act upon it. The Workplace Corruption Act will fight against corruption benefiting the rich and powerful within the workplace, from nepotism to insidious backroom deals. Naturally, their confusion at our behavior will twist into fury, but this will only benefit us in the long run."
ENG_PT_thatcher_looking_in_the_new_industries_desc:0 "The growth of cutting-edge sectors these last few years, in particular computer engineering, have introduced the world of business to young, fresh-faced CEOs - polar oppsites of established captains of industry. Thatcher can easier envision herself working hand-in-hand with England's new nouveau riche than with the staid men decades their senior in wealth, influence, and above all corruption."
ENG_PT_thatcher_calming_the_old_guard_desc:0 "As the Prime Minister expected, our current populist course of action has sparked fury amongst the Royal Party's Old Guard, whose cries of protestation have since transformed into anger. In order to placate these esteemed gentlemen and secure their tenuous support, Thatcher will quell their fears through private conversations at times and places of their choosing."
ENG_PT_thatcher_we_must_learn_to_work_with_everyone_desc:0 "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will present an open hand for the country's elite to hold onto, allowing them influence in the direction of the Party. we will appease their desire for power while simultaneously utilizing their usefulness through such display of friendship. Unfortunately, the average citizen will take our two-facedness regarding the Old Guard Royalists with scorn, but it is the direction we must take for the sake of stable, efficient government."
ENG_PT_thatcher_dining_with_the_high_class_desc:0 "Thatcher shall meet with members of the upper class aristocracy throughout England in an attempt to align their support towards the Royal Party. Rather than expensive, overbearing wastes of time, the Prime Minister instead sees in the gentry's dinners and balls opportunities to befriend and glean information from her new allies."
ENG_PT_thatcher_a_meeting_in_liverpool_desc:0 "The support of the aristocracy is not enough. In a meeting room in Liverpool, the Prime Minister will meet with giants of industry and powerful magnates to earn their cooperation. If they are willing to listen to the government's terms, then we shall be happy to negotiate policy with them."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_business_protection_act_desc:0 "Soon to be passed by Parliament, the Business Protection Act will deliver definite tax breaks for certain businesses and open exploitable loopholes for the rest. Though we are presenting this bill as another step towards revitalizing the English economy, the public will not be as convinced of its benefits as the elites and Royalist Old Guard who helped draft it."
ENG_PT_thatcher_talking_to_the_people_desc:0 "It is inevitable that the public will view the Business Protection Act as the government bending to the will of the omnipotent Elite. To prevent such negative conceptions from taking root among our voters, Margaret Thatcher will engage in earnest dialogue with them via all known mediums at the government's disposal. A good word may just mean the difference between idle grumbling and bloody protest."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_error_may_we_bring_truth_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher finds her career teetering atop a knife's edge. On one end, the Old Guard of the Royal Party despise her for what she is: a woman of humble origins daring to assert her power. At the other end lies the Opposition, who absolutely despise her for what she does - that being, everything they wouldn't.\n\nPolitics is a game of balance, power and popularity. The Prime Minister will strengthen her support and power bases before it's too late."
ENG_PT_thatcher_but_where_to_focus_desc:0 "The future of Thatcher's policy lies before her, splitting off into two distinct directions. She can either focus her energy on expanding her support within the Royal Party, or striking the Opposition and crushing its relevance and popularity. Perhaps, if she is lucky, she could achieve both..."

Exposing his party's weaknesses is only a matter of asking him questions pertinent to his steadfastly-held ideals - specifically, ideals whose utterance may invoke a dissimilar reaction from some of his own partymen."
ENG_PT_thatcher_cracking_the_UE_desc:0 "We have discerned from Maudling that United England is united only in name. A deep chasm has opened up between the two rival factions within: the conservative Macmillanists and Maudling's liberals. Exploiting this weakness by sowing the seeds of division - bribes, rumors, blackmail - will let the party collapse into petty infighting, all while the public watches aghast at seeing their representatives stoop so low in broad daylight."
ENG_PT_thatcher_blaming_the_NF_for_our_problems_desc:0 "The sheer incompetence of the National Front makes them our easiest target. These fascists were overwhelmingly rejected by the English public during the elections, and their leadership is rife with infighting between the dying Chesterton's 'English Fascists' and Jordan's insane 'English National Socialists'. By pinning all problems in English politics and English society as a whole on the National Front, the people's fury will shift from us to a most convenient scapegoat."
ENG_PT_thatcher_question_time_in_parliament_desc:0 "Prime Minister's Questions is approaching, and it looks set to be the most dramatic one of Thatcher's premiership. United England are furious with our actions, and the National Front's hatred towards us has increased tenfold.\n\nThatcher, however, is an orator and debater of considerable merit. Let's see what these fools have to throw at the Iron Lady."
ENG_PT_thatcher_clearing_the_way_desc:0 "The Old Guard of the Royal Party consider Margaret Thatcher to be little more than a puppet dancing to their tune, but they may have miscalculated. The power of the Prime Minister is not to be scoffed at, and Thatcher will use her new-found power to her absolute advantage."
ENG_PT_thatcher_new_young_faces_in_the_party_desc:0 "Some of the men in our Party are well past their prime. To appeal to the masses, perhaps it would be wise to replace the older (and more rebellious) Royalists with younger parliamentarians. These fresh-faced politicians would likely be ardent Thatcherists - by pure coincidence, of course."
ENG_PT_thatcher_explain_it_to_the_higher_ups_desc:0 "The Old Guard demand explanations for the sudden removal of older politicians in favor of younger, loyal Royalists. Expecting such protestation, Thatcher has prepared a convincing excuse: those removed had clandestinely supported Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance."
ENG_PT_thatcher_shaking_up_the_party_desc:0 "It is time to end the influence of the Old Guard. The Prime Minister will dramatically shake up the Royal Party by firing its most elite members on accusations of HMMLR sympathies, replacing them all with ardent Thatcherites who will abide by her every word and hence establish true government unity."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_annual_party_meeting_desc:0 "The Royal Party is preparing for their annual meeting, and the Old Guard are naturally furious at their leader for her recent actions. If the Prime Minister is to increase her support within her party, she must demonstrate the ability to prove her worth before her detractors."
ENG_PT_thatcher_where_there_is_doubt_may_we_bring_faith_desc:0 "Many of England's citizens remain distrustful of the Royal Party despite its clear-cut victory last election, to say nothing of their own Prime Minister.

With her usual oratory wit, the Prime Minister will give numerous interviews and announcements through the telly and the radio, additionally saving us precious hours otherwise spent meeting citizens in person."

Margaret Thatcher needs their support to strengthen her hold over the ship of state. While some may decry this as petty populism, the Prime Minister believes it the only path to truly uniting the country."
ENG_PT_thatcher_on_who_to_focus_desc:0 "The question stands: which class do we funnel our entire efforts and money into persuading? Bringing the lower class out of its apathy could benefit us greatly, though it would infuriate the Old Guard Royalists. Rallying the middle class behind our cause, however, will not create the same level of populist zeal, but won't be so frowned upon by our moneyed allies."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_lower_class_needs_our_help_desc:0 "We have decided to bring the lower class into the fold. Enticing them fully to the Royal Party will admittedly be difficult, least of all due to... cultural discrepancies, so to say. But take heart, for our efforts will be repaid by a legion of loyal voters at our beck and call."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_middle_class_has_our_back_desc:0 "We have decided to bring the middle class into the fold. While they are not as large a voting bloc as the lower class, swaying them to the ideals of the Royal Party will not prove to be as difficult."

ENG_PT_thatcher_the_new_healthcare_act_desc:0 "The New Healthcare Act plans to provide basic government funding towards our healthcare system, and to boost healthcare opportunities for those who had paid the most for England's survival in its most recent conflict."
ENG_PT_thatcher_battling_unemployment_desc:0 "One of the greatest scourges facing this nation is unemployment. We cannot claim to represent the English people, or boost our economy, if we cannot provide job opportunities for our most vulnerable citizens."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focus_on_rural_areas_desc:0 "We shall focus our efforts on the plight of our destitute farmers. While there are admittedly less unemployed in our rural areas, we can easier create jobs for them than for our city folk. Quick land grants appease the English public faster than comprehensive housing reform, after all."
ENG_PT_thatcher_focus_on_urban_areas_desc:0 "The cities of England shall receive our full attention. It will of course be harder to create jobs in urban areas of the country, but the unemployment figures are far greater - much like the Party's support of this direction."
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_peoples_pm_desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher has demonstrated to the English people that, under her populist premiership, the Royal Party will support the needs of the common people over the demands of society's elite, and the Party's Old Guard. Long live Maggie!"
ENG_PT_thatcher_the_iron_lady_of_the_isles_desc:0 "Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has exceeded all expectations following her rise to power, and cemented her position as the Iron Lady. Her tactics in consolidating control of the Royal Party and dealing with society at large has raised her to the status of one of the strongest politicians in the British Isles.

Furthermore, we will support our nation's great farmers with subsidies to help them not just grow the most bountiful harvests ever, but expand to as-of-yet untilled land, creating more than enough food for all! Finally, we must ensure grocery stores like that of Maggie's youth don't waste their supplies: instead of throwing out surplus goods, they shall be distributed to the food banks and be distributed immediately.

Now the initiative is ours, and they will be shattered to bits. Any libelous newspaper they wish to print? Kindling. MPs speaking against us in public? Sedition.

ENG_PT_2_thatcher_a_calm_population_doesnt_revolt_desc:0 "Parliamentary politics in a collaborationist state is, in summary, incredibly dull. With all these unanimous votes, platitude-laden speeches and procedural drudgery, it baffles us why anyone would want to pay attention to it. Certainly, the less they know about what we're planning soon the better. Why don't we give them pleasant distractions instead?\n\nWe will invest extensive funding into sports and entertainment. Tickets to rugby matches will be cheaper than dirt and tellies will showcase plenty of exciting action movies for the masses. The population will be calm and content with the bread and circuses we'll offer them; consequently, our government will be able to operate unhindered by the hoi polloi."
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_an_ignorant_population_doesnt_vote:0 "An Ignorant Population Doesn't Vote"
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_an_ignorant_population_doesnt_vote_desc:0 "The fact of the matter is that our countrymen are too literate. Your average Tommy on the street doesn't need to read Locke or Orwell and entertain ideas well above their station. The Germans were some of the most educated people in the world before the war, and look at what sort of government that got them! No, no, we need to rethink our entire education system if the people are to live harmoniously in the new England.\n\nWe will slash our education budgets and create banned book lists. From cradle to tomb, we will keep the general population in the dark about political freedoms so they stop caring about losing them. This will secure our grip over the affairs of state."
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_the_russian_way:0 "The Russian Way?"
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_the_russian_way_desc:0 "In 1649, Tsar Alexis of Russia implemented a state monopoly on liquor production. This was a major cash cow for the royal family but also served to keep the population drunk and happy. A drunken population was far easier for them to control, the incident in 1917 notwithstanding. Perhaps we can learn from their example.\n\nWe will implement our own monopoly on beer and spirits and sell them for cheap. This will raise state revenues and also ensure the English people are too drunk to mount effective resistance to Thatcher's policies. Bottoms up, lads!"

ENG_PT_2_thatcher_ties_with_aristocrats_desc:0 "The aristocracy, besides being a great punchline, have retained their political connections despite the war. They know better than anyone that the commoners are unfit to govern themselves. We should enlist their aid in forming a new government.\n\nWe will touch base with Britain's bluebloods and exploit their connections to shore up elite support for our government. This is flagrantly anti-democratic, but it may be necessary to secure our grip on the state."

ENG_PT_2_thatcher_nightmares_of_cromwell_desc:0 "The foreign press are unbearably cruel to poor Maggie. They call her a tyrant, an anti-democratic oppressor and, in one instance, Oliver Cromwell come again. Ridiculous. We have a King, good King Edward, and Thatcher is nothing more than his Prime Minister.\n\nAnd yet, she truly is the one calling the shots in this country, isn't she? All effective opposition has been eliminated, both in Parliament and among the people. Though she has no peerage, she lords over England by herself. Perhaps her rule will stretch across the Isles, just as the Lord Protector's did so many years ago."

ENG_PT_2_thatcher_a_democratic_system_tamed_desc:0 "England has embraced democratic principles ever since King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215; it would be a sisyphean task for us to try and undo them. There is no better way to maintain our government than to have the people backing it. However much power we might grab, we must work within the system to uphold our new administration.\n\nWe will maintain democratic elections, but ruthlessly use our political leverage to wrangle Parliament around to our side. This will still leave the people with a chance to vote us out, but we can also make the most use of government apparatuses while we're here. Democracy will be preserved, guided by Thatcher's strong hand."
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_finish_off_the_liberals:0 "Finish off the Liberals"
ENG_PT_2_thatcher_finish_off_the_liberals_desc:0 "The Liberals had a purpose before the failed uprising. They were idealists, or as idealistic as collaborators could be, and tried to push our government further towards democracy and social openness. But Thatcher's Independents have already secured democracy for England. The Liberals have won that battle, and now it's time for them to lay down arms and get with our programme.\n\nThatcher will court the remaining parliamentary Liberals and entice them to cross the aisle to her party. All Liberal holdouts will face intense propaganda against them in the next election. We will use this opportunity to mop up the remains of our opposition."

Yet he remains a charismatic speaker - and after all, it's best to keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Let's make a deal.\n\nWe will reach out to Macmillan to form a unity government. We will tell him that we too are opposed to fascism, and that we are willing to preserve the democratic system with their cooperation. With him on our side, we will co-opt and mollify any potential opposition. This shall secure our grip over the Commons for generations to come."

The remaining fascists in our country are a black stain on British society; like a good wife, our Maggie knows how to rub out stains.\n\nWe will introduce the Anti-Fascism Act in the House of Commons. The bill will make professing fascist identity a criminal offense. It will become illegal for fascists to speak in public, but that will be the least of their worries since all known fascists will be thrown in the clink. Macmillan will be delighted, and out nation will be stronger than ever.\n\n§RThis is hardly democratic now, is it?§!"

The jewel of India, the jungles of Africa, the wealth of Hong Kong, and the clement West Indies. Thatcher remembers it all. She dreams of a day when it will all be hers, ours, again.\n\nYet the Empire was shattered in just 5 years. It will hardly be easy to reclaim it, especially from our position of relative weakness. She will have to be patient and clever if she wants to reclaim Britain's birthright. Let's get to work."

Union jacks fly from Cornwall to Clydesdale. God Save the King rings out from Belfast to Birmingham. Our homeland in its entirety bows to one sovereign once more!\n\nIt's all thanks to the wise leadership of good ol' Maggie. She steered England through the turbulence of the Civil War to mastery over the Isles. She expelled the treacherous Hun. She freed the refugees in Scotland. Most importantly, she united Parliament behind her glorious agenda. She is the great helmswoman of the new Britain, and she alone what its future holds.\n\n§RDoesn't she?§!"

ENG_MT_thatcher_army_reforms_desc:0 "The English Civil War exposed many problems with our country, the Royal Army included; in some battles, its performance was lackluster at best. In many cases its methods and equipment have barely progressed since the end of the Second World War.\n\nIt is imperative that we learn from our mistakes, and reform our army so that it will be sufficiently prepared for any future engagements. However, we must also keep in mind the prejudices harbored by senior officers who would prefer a return to the grand old army that lost us against the Germans in the first place."
ENG_MT_thatcher_offensive_efforts_desc:0 "By the War's end, the Army faced numerous issues in dealing with stubborn rebel holdouts. As a result of these failings, we lost far more good soldiers than we needed to. All of the issues with our current offensive capabilities have been made glaringly clear, and they will have to be fixed if our men are to stand a chance of surviving their next offensives."
ENG_MT_thatcher_armed_police_desc:0 "Our army needs more men. Unfortunately, the Civil War drained us of them. We will never be able to properly defend England from invaders unless we address this shortage - one which our boffins might just address.\n\nBy incorporating the police as an integral part of our homeland defense, we can greatly increase the amount of reserves available to the army whilst ensuring better security within our border."
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_spec_ops_desc:0 "Training professional soldiers specially trained in asymmetrical warfare would make invading England a much harder task than it currently is. These new Special Forces would be an effective use of our limited resources, in contrast to sending our men to proverbial meat grinders. We should learn from our mistakes, not replicate them on a larger scale."
ENG_MT_thatcher_chieftain_tank_desc:0 "We need to supply our armed forces with new, up-to-date tanks to compete with other would-be opponents. Focusing on the development of the promising Chieftain Tank should be our priority if we are to achieve this goal. This valuable addition to the Army's stores will help us stand toe to toe against even the most advanced armor the rest of the world has to offer."
ENG_MT_thatcher_fv432_apc_desc:0 "Producing tanks may seem like a good idea on the surface, yet the fact of the matter is that we merely do not have the resources, nor the industrial capacity, to spare for such lumbering hulks.\n\nArmored personnel carriers, particularly the encouraging FV43 design, are better and cheaper alternatives to the expensive and ineffective tanks we would otherwise produce. We must be honest with ourselves; tanks may be a prestigious addition to our military, but it would be irresponsible to believe that we could manufacture enough to genuinely threaten the likes of the Germans."
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_royal_marines_desc:0 "England has always prided herself in her brave and able Royal Marines. In the days when Britannia ruled the waves, a feared and noble force in equal measure. Reinvigorating our Marines will not only increase the overall strength of our armed forces, but also restore some of the old esteem our army once held. After all, we were powerful once. Why not use our history to restore our rightful place in the present?"
ENG_MT_thatcher_new_self_propelled_guns_desc:0 "What we need is firepower, plain and simple. We can hearken back to the past all we like, but that will not help us as much as modern artillery would. New self-propelled guns will give us a huge advantage over our enemies, as well as providing our army with the means to rain salvos upon them with the maneuverability and accuracy they desperately need. The more of these we order, the better."
ENG_MT_thatcher_military_industry_desc:0 "Our military industry is somewhat lacking at the moment. Weapons manufacturing is inefficient and our army is suffering because of it. We need to focus on increasing the volume of our production, thus upscaling our military greatly.\n\nBy producing more guns, more aircraft and more armor, we will be able to take the fight to our opponents."
ENG_MT_thatcher_defensive_efforts_desc:0 "Now that all the rebel guns have been silenced throughout England, we now have time to properly prepare our country's defenses. Yet there is still much to be done before fair Albion is amply defended from its foes. We will have to make several decisions, but whatever we choose to do we must be certain that it will keep our people safe.\n\nThe defense of our homeland must be prioritised before anything else. Not for nothing is "Never another Sealion" a slogan shared by Englishmen regardless of politics."
ENG_MT_thatcher_elite_army_desc:0 "We shall take steps to turn the Royal Army into the most well-trained and organized of its kind on Earth. Shaping the Royal Army into an elite, world class force will incur some hefty costs, but the strength they entail will soon be worth the sacrifice.\n\nThe country needs an army flexible enough to contain any invader, to protect its borders and safeguard the people."
ENG_MT_thatcher_trench_training_desc:0 "If England is ever invaded again, we will have to be prepared to hold fortified positions to stop any attackers in their tracks. Entrenching ourselves in static positions would ensure that the Germans would have a harder time fighting us should they dare invade a second time.\n\nThis worked for us to some extent in the Great War, so why should we not refine it for the modern age? It would certainly be a cheaper method than training all of our soldiers to an impossibly high standard."
ENG_MT_thatcher_artillery_equipment_desc:0 "Our army experienced a constant shortcoming of available firepower many times in the Civil War. Bringing our artillery up to a modern standard would improve the strength of our army no end, and gives us a key advantage over our opponents.\n\nUltimately, our army needs heavy weapons more than it needs better infantry."
ENG_MT_thatcher_small_arms_equipment_desc:0 "Improving our ineffective infantry should always be our utmost concern. The Army will last in protracted combat only as long as its men. Hence we will prioritize offering weapons and skills necessary to defend England alongside the King's shilling.\n\nEvery man must learn to fight to the best of his ability, in case total war comes a-knocking in our lifetimes."
ENG_MT_thatcher_anti_air_equipment_desc:0 "One of the most terrifying aspects of Sealion was the extensive, ruinous damage done by the Luftwaffe's bombers. Now their air raids have been made even more destructive thanks to new technology, and their fighters still outclass our own.\n\nWe have no choice but to build additional anti-air emplacements across the country. Only then shall our cities and airfields be sheltered from the Luftwaffe's fell talons. This may seem to be an overly pessimistic view to some; then again, they're better off safe from aerial bombardment than submerged in sorry and rubble."
ENG_MT_thatcher_coastal_defence_desc:0 "The best way to defend England is to defend its coast. Sealion demonstrated many of our failings in that regard, least of all our overreliance in the Royal Navy. Swept aside by the Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe, our sinking ships could but only watch helplessly as Germans scale Dover's pristine cliffs.\n\nBy necessity, Englishmen must be quick to adapt. Thus the way forward lies with emplacements keeping watch over every grain of sand on England's shores. More fool the man who dares assail an impregnable island fortress."
ENG_MT_thatcher_doctrinal_advances_desc:0 "After months spent rectifying the flaws in our antiquated equipment and tactics, we can finally begin the laborious process of integrating them into the armed forces' modernized doctrines. The English Army will have clear plans in place for any future war, ones which guarantee swift victory against the hubris of would-be conquerors. Our people can now rest well with the knowledge that their homeland is again protected by a mighty bulwark, oaken or steely - and should it find use in the future, without the weaknesses that had doomed its predecessor."
ENG_MT_thatcher_rebuild_royal_navy_desc:0 "Today the Royal Navy is a shadow of its former self. This was not the case a mere generation ago; then it was the very symbol of the British Empire's power and majesty, securing its expansive waters and protecting its every subject wherever corner of the globe they set foot upon.\n\nAlas, much of it now exists only as scrap metal in Davy Jones' Locker - and in the hearts of those who yearn for a past unjustly ended. Our newfound largesse in mind, they insist that the time has come to remind the world of an old English paean's lines:\n\n"Britannia rules the waves!""
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_focus_desc:0 "The introduction of aircraft carriers signalled a paradigm shift in modern sea power. Where before control of vital sea lanes were decided by burnished rows of becannoned special treatment steel, the Second World War proved that even the mightiest battleships were fatally humbled by torpedo salvos from planes a bare fraction of its size. Thus every superpower worth the title now possesses aircraft carriers, ever vital for projecting their strength thousands of miles from their shores.\n\nAircraft carriers are key to bringing the Royal Navy into the post-war era, no matter what some maimed sea dogs clamor."
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_screen_ships_desc:0 "Our new carrier will require adequate protection once it leaves its berth. Far be it for us to leave a floating island worth £3 million unprotected.\n\nHence, MoD has ordered several cruisers from our shipyards. These and the carrier will soon form the crux of the new Royal Navy - and a well-protected one, at that." 
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_support_ships_desc:0 "A carrier can not sink an entire navy on its own, much as we would prefer so. It needs an ample complement of vessels capable of contributing firepower to the fleet it's assigned.\n\nIn its prescience, the Royal Navy's budget for the year included new cruisers and submarines: ships very much built with firepower in mind. With these we can prove, should the occasion arise, that England can match its foes toe-to-toe in the open sea."
ENG_MT_thatcher_carrier_ship_construction_desc:0 "With the prerequisite paperwork and funds set in order, our shipyards can now begin construction of the Royal Navy's newest aircraft carrier. Their workers will labor tirelessly to ensure its christening at the soonest possible date.\n\nThe Royal Navy's strength will increase manyfold after its commission, along with England's global reach. All creatures of sky and sea will learn that the Royal Navy shall soon return to its rightwise berth high above them."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_focus_desc:0 "Britain has always prided itself on its battleships, the greatest of which were the jewels in the Royal Navy's coronet. They were the behemoths that protected our seas at Jutland, and valiantly fought the Axis until they could no longer stay afloat.\n\nSome within MoD openly harbor an obsession over 'modernizing' Britain's most noble institution, and insist on constructing floating airstrips over the legacies of Nelson, Fisher and Jellicoe. Pure folly of course: the English people needs pride and prestige, not staid attempts at progress.\n\nAnd a mighty battleship has pride and prestige aplenty."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_screen_ships_desc:0 "We must make sure our new battleship will be well protected. England at this stage, if ever, can ill afford its fleet's latest pride sharing the Hood's fate in the future; with the leaps submarine technology have enjoyed as of late, it may well do so in the event of a shooting war.\n\nHence, the Royal Navy has procured several ASW-capable destroyers which will see service within the next decade."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_cruisers_desc:0 "As its firepower is sadly limited, our battleship will need several cruisers to help support it. They may not be as prominent as a battleship, but they will nevertheless form an indispensable part of the Royal Navy's fleet. Any adversary will think twice before drawing the torrential ire of our battleship and cruisers' shells."
ENG_MT_thatcher_battleship_construction_desc:0 "With the prerequisite paperwork and funds set in order, our shipyards can now begin construction of the Royal Navy's newest capital ship. Their workers will labor tirelessly to ensure its christening at the soonest possible date.\n\nOne dissenting soul, however, raised a unique dissention during the planning phase. Rather than building one ginormous battleship, he said, the Royal Navy would be better served adopting in part the late Admiral Jellicoe's vision: two battlecruisers, less armed and armored but more agile than a lumbering battleship,\n\nWhichever option we choose, England's oldest bulwark will assuredly see its presence known once more."
ENG_MT_thatcher_naval_doctrine_advances_desc:0 "Having commissioned the ships just recently leaving drydock, the Royal Navy can now prioritize planning how best to use them at sea. This entails extensive revisions to its existing battle plans and tactics.\n\nOnce these adjustments are made however, it won't be long before the reinvigorated Royal Navy revisits a sliver of its mythical past. Sally forth from old England's channel, hearts of oak, and with your foghorns sound Britannia's return as a power without peer!"
ENG_MT_thatcher_rebuild_royal_airforce_desc:0 "Ever since its disastrous performance in the Second World War, the Royal Air Force has been left to wither and rot in decripit airstrips across England. A sorry state indeed for an armada thought beyond its time before the Luftwaffe tore it to shreds.\n\nIn agreement with the Ministry of Defense, the Thatcher administration pleges to rebuild the RAF into a state worthy of protecting England's heavenly main. It will hopefully do better than it had in 1943 after all is said and done."
ENG_MT_thatcher_harrier_programme_desc:0 "Disposing slow, ungainly, and antiquated fighters is part and parcel of securing England's skies. In lieu of old Spitfires and Meteors, a consortium of English defense contractors have designed a promising jet plane labelled the "Harrier", far superior to either (and the equal of its foreign contemporaries) in specifications. The Defense Minister recommends expediting development thereof as much as we can.\n\n"Second life" is no exaggeration for the effects our first Harrier wings will provide to the RAF. In good time, the world will soon fear England's very own bird of prey. "
ENG_MT_thatcher_raf_bases_desc:0 "Most of the airbases dotting England's emerald hills are haphazard constructs built in a frenzy before Sealion. It stands to reason that a fair share lost their purpose after 1943. Dirt runways and ramshackle sheds may suffice for biplanes - but not for modern jet fighters with appetite and temperament overflowing.\n\nNew, larger air bases will be built to accommodate our future air fleet. Modern dogfighting favors a preponderance of runways and supply stores over a glut of airbases in the term's loosest definition; after all, the more fighters we can fly at any time, the likelier we establish aerial supremacy before the enemey does."
ENG_MT_thatcher_jet_engine_innovation_desc:0 "One among the Royal Air Force's biggest issues is its obsolescence in the age of jet. The Harrier has been an encouraging start, but more will have to be done. Most of our research on jet engines has not progressed far beyond the standards of 1943 considering we heretofore lacked the knowledge, and more importantly the funds, to meaningfully proceed in its relevant avenues.\n\nThis must be rectified posthaste. Let us jump head-first into a new age by building a jet industry of our own."
ENG_MT_thatcher_vtol_stol_desc:0 "England's runways have become antiquated and unsuited to the demands of most modern fighter jets. Rather than reinventing the airbase at ruinous cost, MoD instead recommends retrofitting our new Harriers with vertical take-off and landing engines. The capability to leave base without a long runway will ensure the continued use of much of our WW2-era airstrips."
ENG_MT_thatcher_harrier_missiles_desc:0 "Another aspect of aerial combat in which we fall short is weaponry. Foreign fighters are equipped with devastatingly powerful missiles capable of turning aircraft into bits of molten slag mid-flight. Equipping our Harriors with some of the world-class missiles our boffins have developed is an unquestionable must."
ENG_MT_thatcher_modernise_radar_desc:0 "Before and during the Second World War, British research and implementation of radar systems was unparalleled worldwide. We fervently believed the techology was our war-winning weapon against the Hun. Though undeniably useful, it proved insufficient in sealing our fate.\n\nHowever, modernizing our old radar systems would once again give us an edge over our enemies. We will have to be open to such improvements for the sake of free English skies."
ENG_MT_thatcher_pilot_training_desc:0 "The RAF suffered from a dearth of pilots throughout the Second World War. Doubtless those we had finagled may have been some of the bravest men in Britain, but truly skilled aviators were few and far between.\n\nThus far England is incapable of maintaining an air force equal in count to that of the Germans, Americans and Japanese, and so must rely on each its fighter pilots' skill more than the world's three superpowers. Every possible effort must be made to ensure that they are the best in the world."
ENG_MT_thatcher_air_doctrinal_advances_desc:0 "Having made several advances in updating the Royal Air Force, there is no doubt that our doctrine requires updating. After all, there would be no point in improving our air force if none of our strategies were updated too. Efficiency must be assured if we are to properly defend against the Luftwaffe.\n\nSoon the RAF will reclaim England's skies. We pray they remain clear forevermore."

ENG_ET_thatcher_grocer_daughter:0 "The Grocer Daughter"
ENG_ET_thatcher_grocer_daughter_desc:0 "Prime Minister Thatcher inherits the legacy of her entrepreneuring father Alfred Roberts. Without an open free market, he would've simply toiled until the grave, living off the government dole. Instead, he was able to take the leap into starting a successful grocer's shop that left the family quite comfortable. The tragedy of Britain then, is that of fascist regulations, of constant barriers to success.\n\nEvery man should be able to supply goods and services, free of burdensome taxes and arbitrary regulations. Margaret Thatcher learned everything she needed to know from hard work and personal responsibility alongside the joy of serving her father's business. Soon, all of Britain will again be a nation of entrepreneurs."
ENG_ET_thatcher_introducing_thatcherism:0 "Introducing Thatcherism"
ENG_ET_thatcher_introducing_thatcherism_desc:0 "The typewriters in Downing Street have been operating at a furious clip, as PM Thatcher readies the most critical address of her premiership. Before Parliament, she will outline the future of the English economy; the broad slashing of taxes and regulations known to both friend and foe as "Thatcherism". Given that her power in government has been largely cemented, little blowback from the addresses is anticipated."
ENG_ET_thatcher_controlling_cash:0 "Controlling Cash"
ENG_ET_thatcher_controlling_cash_desc:0 "We inherit a ravaged landscape, where the pound seems to shed value every day and nary a street corner can be turned without finding someone asking for work. Under Thatcher, a bold new solution is clear that requires no concessions to communistic government programs. With the erratic value of our currency being the core of the nation's ills, it must be brought to heel like the rabid dog it is.\n\nDrawing on the sadly little known ideas of the Austrian School, our government shall embark on a vigorous implementation of monetarism. Circulation of the pound shall be subject to the strictest of controls, especially in regards to profligate government spending. Only when the private sector grows sufficiently shall we increase the circulation, for we know the dark alternative in front of us is no viable path. Cut it all down to a manageable level, from social programs to taxes, and our markets will stabilize to a perfect level. "
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_will_be_hard:0 "The Road Will Be Hard"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_will_be_hard_desc:0 "A sick child must take bitter medicine if they wish to be healthy again. Such a principle applies to economies, too. The disloyal politicians and slithering resistance has bellowed since Thatcher's rise that our reforms are too extreme, that we will ruin the lot of the working man and remove any sense of stability in the economy. Now, as unemployment rises and we plunge into recession, these illiterate fools claim that they have been vindicated. The only thing that truly has been proven, however, is that our opponents care not a hair about economic science.\n\nThe Prime Minister, as a student of free-market principles, knows that such disruptions will come with the two-pronged approach of cuts and privatization. But such a situation will rectify itself, as a properly free market always does, and within a year we shall see the greatest period of growth in our history, a massive reduction in unemployment, an all-around boom of prosperity on the Isles. Let the traitors and communists cry foul; there will be no room for them once our entrepreneuring state cements itself on the world stage. We can not reverse course, for nothing worth doing is ever easy."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_u_turn:0 "A U-Turn"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_u_turn_desc:0 "Our reforms have been too bold, and we have found ourselves at the center of an arrogant drive to rapidly reshape society. The fluctuations of the market are proving too volatile for us to manage, and we must scale back our reforms before the entire country calls for our head.\n\nThis will hurt not just the future prosperity of Britain, but our entire base of support. Those who trusted us to create a booming entrepreneurial state have slowly receded as whispers increase about a return to a more sensible, moderate leader to strengthen the state. If we play this carefully and work to rectify our path as soon as possible, perhaps we can survive. Otherwise, the hope of a liberalized economy may die forever on the Isles."
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_flat_taxes:0 "Flat Taxes"
ENG_ET_thatcher_road_flat_taxes_desc:0 "How can we ever hope to build a freer, more prosperous England if government bureaucrats are always pickpocketing our workers? Furthermore, how can we ever hope to equally reward all labor if we believe that a hard-working, wealthy man should be taxed more than a lazy bum? The solution to these issues of taxation is to level it all off. We must tax each Englishman on more or less the same level, demonstrating that the hard work of success should be rewarded rather than punished."
ENG_ET_thatcher_indirect_taxation_act:0 "Indirect Taxation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_indirect_taxation_act_desc:0 "The very cornerstone of a free market, that of unimpeded rights to buy and sell goods, has been distorted for decades. "Sales tax," "value-added tax," "excise tax." These are all simply by-words for theft of an entrepreneur's rightful wealth. We say no to this tyrannical practice, and will prepare to pass the Indirect Taxation Act.\n\nThe ITA removes the many taxes placed on consumer goods, taxes that artificially inflate prices and stifle economic growth. Such a regressive measure hurts both worker and employer, and few could genuinely approve of such measures. Our economists already predict the booming of all economic measures once the ITA is passed, with our job-creators set to benefit the most. The only way one could oppose such a plan is the communistic desire to steal every last penny from our innovators in order to create a bloated web of social programs. To this, we can say that if a "social" program is built on theft from hard workers, it is more unjust than that which it seeks to remedy!"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_man_works:0 "Every Englishman Will Work"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_man_works_desc:0 "Sloth is the greatest sin a society can be struck with, for only without it can it truly value itself. This maxim must be taken seriously in the new England we are creating. Unemployment is largely the product of lacking personal ambition, and we must take whatever measures necessary to instill individual drive in all of our citizens. We need companies to aggressively find the unemployed and bring them into the fold, we need the government to stop intervening in private enterprise and start intervening in the affairs of the lethargic legions of unemployed. Find every man a job, do not cease until this society has eradicated slothfulness. Only then, when every man knows he must work, and work well, shall we begin working towards the booming entrepreneur's state."
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_woman_works:0 "Every Englishwoman will Work"
ENG_ET_thatcher_every_woman_works_desc:0 "An economy is a project everyone must take part in if we as a nation want to see it reach great heights. When Margaret Thatcher was helping out her father's grocery, she saw firsthand the key role played by her mother in that businesses' success. Now, we unfortunately preside over a society where a woman participating in the economy is frowned upon due to amorphous social concerns. To that, we ask how we can ever be wealthy if half the population is not allowed to enter the realm of prosperity?\n\nIf a woman has the chance to work, the government must support our businesses in allowing her that chance. We are not suggesting anything so chaotic as employment for all women, for of course many have key roles in the home. But Thatcher knows firsthand the enterprising mind of women, and how much their drive to success should be nurtured in the building of national economic strength. Let's mobilize our resources to find work for all women who choose it, rather than regulating the few who have struggled to make it."
ENG_ET_thatcher_fair_employment_act:0 "Fair Employment Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_fair_employment_act_desc:0 "In an economy where the entrepreneur provides jobs, we must ensure that everyone can equally get those jobs. Enter the Fair Employment Act, which aims to prevent employer discrimination so that we can all prosper.\n\nThe FEA will ensure that every productive, upstanding member of society can share in its wealth. Employers may not discriminate based on sex, religion, nationality, or race, unless they have a just objection. The same applies to housing and schooling, both critical pieces of economic life. It goes without saying however, that this is not some liberal legislation that will allow for degeneracy in society. It would be absolutely criminal to require traitors, sexual deviants, and subversive races to be treated as normal Britons. Any slander about us allowing such people to have a place in society must be shut down immediately, to not equivocate the making a more equal economy with the infection of society."
ENG_ET_thatcher_final_push_success:0 "A Final Push to Success"
ENG_ET_thatcher_final_push_success_desc:0 "Already the average worker, free from the tyrannical tax-men and union bosses, is seeing more money in his pocket. Already our entrepreneurs are opening new and booming businesses at a dizzying rate. We are on the cusp of a prospering free-market state, but there still remain opponents in every corner.\n\nThe ranks of the Royal Party still crawl with opportunists awaiting a downturn, or even the slightest reversal of policy, so that they can stop our plans for the future. Meanwhile, Bolshevists and other dangerous types prowl the streets, looking for anyone to turn against free enterprise. Knowing these obstacles, while also being aware of our nearness to success, how shall we strike our final blow at the foes of prosperity? Must we slacken the pace to rally our party and potentially isolate radical critics? Or would it be easier to go full speed ahead, keeping iron discipline in the party and the streets with our police force?"
ENG_ET_thatcher_slow_and_steady:0 "Slow and Steady"
ENG_ET_thatcher_slow_and_steady_desc:0 "Prosperity is a given, based on our current policies. Scientifically, tax cuts and deregulation can only lead to growth. With that in mind, why do we need to rush towards something already guaranteed? We would only be shooting ourselves in the foot if we insisted, at all costs, that we need wealth for everyone today. Let's take this one step at a time, making certain that we have the party on our side with each new piece of legislation. Once the money starts piling up, nobody will in good faith question our plan, because it will have harmed nobody and benefited everyone."
ENG_ET_thatcher_in_the_lady_eyes:0 "In the Lady's Eyes"
ENG_ET_thatcher_in_the_lady_eyes_desc:0 "We move towards the most prosperous era in English history, and can accept no obstacles to that task. Any Bolshevik agitator or secessionist traitor attempting to sabotage this growth, attempting to oppose universal prosperity through some misguided Marxist ideology, this must be crushed. In every city, our police forces know the names and faces of everyone surrounding them, and will act against subversion on a moment's notice. Soon, the days of division and squalor will be nothing but vague memory, as its proponents are completely shunted away. "
ENG_ET_thatcher_free_market_free_people:0 "Free Market, Free People"
ENG_ET_thatcher_free_market_free_people_desc:0 ""The freer the market, the freer the people."\n\nThis is a self-evident truth, the less the government interferes in people's businesses, the less it will interfere with their business. Freedom of commerce will inevitably lead to, not only increased incomes and prosperity, but also to increased freedoms in general. Afterall, wasn't Nazi Germany, the undisputed least free nation, a command economy? And was the economic crash of the 1950s that crippled Europe not due to the over-regulation and the rampant government mandated military overproduction of Germany? If we are to ensure our people's freedom and our nation's economic well-being we must return to the free market."
ENG_ET_thatcher_days_of_old_passed:0 "The Days of the Old Have Passed"
ENG_ET_thatcher_days_of_old_passed_desc:0 "Our economic cabinet is full to the brim of old-fashioned advisors. If we are to bring forward our economy into the future, we must stop thinking backwardly. To this end we will begin modernizing our economy by first modernizing our cabinet. All of the economists with outdated opinions must be removed. Their ideas are well past their prime and we shall retire those ideas alongside those economists themselves. In their place we shall elevate new ministers with new ideas to fit a new vision for the future. If it just so happens by some... coincidence... that these new economists all happen to support Miss Thatcher then that is simply an... added benefit."
ENG_ET_thatcher_privatising_economy:0 "Privatising Economy"
ENG_ET_thatcher_privatising_economy_desc:0 "In accordance with our goal of a free market for a free people we must start the privatization of the British economy. By selling off formerly government owned industries, we can loosen the grasp of the government on the economy and allow the people to manage it their way, the free way. Additionally, these newly privatized businesses will have lower prices and greater incentives to operate efficiently. This shall increase their competitiveness both at home and abroad, bringing further prosperity to the nation."
ENG_ET_thatcher_deals_with_big_companies:0 "Deals with Big Companies"
ENG_ET_thatcher_deals_with_big_companies_desc:0 "It doesn't take an economic genius to understand that it simply isn't possible to privatize massive industries such as steel and iron overnight. It will require a monumental effort on our part. To help ease this transition towards a fully free market we shall attempt to settle deals and agreements with large businesses to begin to privatize iron and steel. We can not fully privatize those industries as of yet, that would be too large a task to achieve at this point in time, but with some smart negotiations we can at least begin the process."
ENG_ET_thatcher_iron_and_steel_act:0 "The Iron and Steel Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_iron_and_steel_act_desc:0 "Now that we have worked out the bargains with the big businesses, we can complete the process of the transferring control of the iron and steel industry to the private sector. While this may make these resources more expensive to purchase, in the long run the overall benefits to the economy as a whole will be much greater as a result than if these industries were kept under government control.\n\nLet's get to it."
ENG_ET_thatcher_coal_act:0 "The Coal Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_coal_act_desc:0 "Time to attempt something new.\n\nNow that iron and steel have been both privatized, it is time to begin a foray into other areas. Coal is a good start. We shall privatize the coal industry in order to acquire information on the success of privatized industries. It shall be our little... experiment. A successful result may lead to further developments in our journey of privatization. A failure may lead to... unexpected consequences."
ENG_ET_thatcher_communications_act:0 "The Communcations Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_communications_act_desc:0 "As for the next step in our journey towards a free market: communications. We shall ensure that the entirety of the communications sector is passed into private hands. This may cause some economic hardship from unemployment since the new private communications sector will be attempting to maximise profits rather than employment. However, we believe the overall result will be a net benefit across the board. Afterall, who's going to complain about the lower prices that come about as a result? Communications will become much more accessible in subsequent years, helping our nation become much more unified and connected."
ENG_ET_thatcher_not_go_overboard:0 "Lets not go Overboard"
ENG_ET_thatcher_not_go_overboard_desc:0 "Now then, we can't be going too far too fast with this. If we fly too close to the sun our wings may burn. There are many in the party, ignorant and foolish members, who do not look kindly upon our efforts to ensure freedom in our country. They do not approve of our methods and yet we must still put up with them for now. To this end, we will make sure not to privatize too extensively lest we incur the displeasure of the party."
ENG_ET_thatcher_aviation_act:0 "The Aviation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_aviation_act_desc:0 "To add to the growing list of personal freedoms our people will have, we shall grant them freedom of movement and travel. To this end, we shall privatize the aviation industry, in order to lower prices and increase options for the consumers. This shall also have the effect of encouraging innovative methods and ideas to be developed by businesses seeking an edge over their competitors."
ENG_ET_thatcher_rail_and_road_act:0 "The Rail and Road Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_rail_and_road_act_desc:0 "Our last but by no means least important action shall be to privatize our nation's infrastructure. The road and rail act shall turn over control and responsibility of the country's transportation system to private businesses. Overall, if successful, this should result in a sustained increase in the quality of the country's infrastructure. The government shall of course still maintain a small degree of control over the rail and road industry in order to ensure a continued acceptable level of quality."
ENG_ET_thatcher_missed_chance:0 "A Missed Chance?"
ENG_ET_thatcher_missed_chance_desc:0 "Since claiming power over England and her economy, Thatcher has dreamed of unlocking its potential through daring privatization initiatives. Yet, as Party pressure grew and grew to unfathomable heights, she has been forced to turn her back on such reforms and embrace moderation.\n\nShe has bent to the will of the wets, and only time will tell if the English people will forgive her for betraying her values. Only one thing is for certain, however – Margaret Thatcher will never forgive herself. "
ENG_ET_thatcher_small_govt_of_people:0 "Small Government of the People"
ENG_ET_thatcher_small_govt_of_people_desc:0 "If the English are to respect their government, they must believe that government control over their lives is at an all-time low. For Thatcher, a perfect world would indeed herald the rise of a truly small government, one that respects localism and the full autonomy of individuals.\n\nBut this is not a perfect world. While presenting ourselves as a "small" government to the public, we will in fact be snatching power away from major companies and local cities in order to increase centralization. As with many of our lies in these dark times, they are a small evil necessary for saving the nation."
ENG_ET_thatcher_looking_over_local_authorities:0 "Looking over Local Authorities"
ENG_ET_thatcher_looking_over_local_authorities_desc:0 "Like a raven surveying the English countryside with its beady black eyes, we shall scour the nation for any sign of misfeasance. The incompetence of previous Prime Ministers has seen the rot of corruption spread throughout the leadership of local cities, which is an obvious threat to the state. We must locate this corruption and strike while the iron is hot."
ENG_ET_thatcher_breaking_and_merging:0 "Breaking and Merging"
ENG_ET_thatcher_breaking_and_merging_desc:0 "We are continuing to formulate our plans for the cities. The powerful local authorities throughout the country will be broken up by the great hammer of the state, and forcefully merged with new institutions forged by the government. The new authorities to emerge in the local cities will be considerably weaker, of course, which in turn will increase Thatcher's power."
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_local_authorities:0 "Targeting Corruption in Local Authorities"
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_local_authorities_desc:0 "Our main focus is obvious. We have uncovered the corruption of local authorities throughout England and formulated plans to diminish their power. The time to strike is now, and only by targeting these authorities immediately can we further centralize the power of Thatcher's government."
ENG_ET_thatcher_local_powers_act:0 "The Local Powers Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_local_powers_act_desc:0 "The Local Powers Act will set our plans into motion to reduce the power of local authorities in the name of targeting corruption.\n\nWhile the common citizens of England have shown their distaste towards the upcoming passing of this Act, fearing greater government centralization, it has proven to be a stroke of political success for Margaret Thatcher in the upper echelons of power. The elite of the Royalist Party support this Act wholeheartedly, and its passing will doubtless further solidify their support."
ENG_ET_thatcher_we_are_liberating_you:0 "We are Liberating You!"
ENG_ET_thatcher_we_are_liberating_you_desc:0 "To alleviate the fears of the English citizenry, the government will attempt to produce a simple explanation of the Local Powers Act that men and women of all backgrounds will understand. In particular, we shall stress how harmful the corruption within the leadership of the local cities has been to the common people, and how stamping this out will ensure their safety. We must drag the national narrative from "government centralization" to one of "liberation from corruption"."
ENG_ET_thatcher_all_powers_back_to_us:0 "All Powers Come Back Under Us."
ENG_ET_thatcher_all_powers_back_to_us_desc:0 "The Local Powers Act can officially be declared a success.\n\nThe Royalist Party elite are pleased, an information campaign is being conducted to shift the views of the citizenry, and the power wielded by the local authorities has been drastically reduced. These powers, once held by corrupt local leaders to serve their own aims, are now the iron grip of Thatcher's government, and will be used to serve the people."
ENG_ET_thatcher_the_enemy_within:0 "The Enemy Within"
ENG_ET_thatcher_the_enemy_within_desc:0 "Not all of the insidious forces who oppose us lurk in the corridors of Westminster or scheme in the basements of ideological fanatics. According to our reports, there is a litany of anti-government individuals in the business world, and any men of such power are a threat to the Royalist Party.\n\nThe government will comb through the business world of England to find such individuals and root them out. Whether these business leaders openly support fascism or secretly harbor communist sympathies, they must be dealt with swiftly."
ENG_ET_thatcher_company_investigation_act:0 "The Company Investigation Act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_company_investigation_act_desc:0 "With the passing of the Company Investigation Act, the government will have the power to launch an official investigation into all the English companies and CEOs we have determined to be a potential threat to the nation. While the business world will doubtless be furious at such an Act, there will be little resistance elsewhere in English society towards our attempts to root out fascist and communist figures in such influential positions."
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_companies:0 "Targeting the Corrupt Companies"
ENG_ET_thatcher_targetting_corruption_companies_desc:0 "The government has decided to focus on the danger of anti-government threats within the business industry. Bringing the CEOs to heel and burning out the corruption in English companies is, by far, more important to the stability of the nation than draining the power of local city authorities. We have the names, we have the power – now we must act"
ENG_ET_thatcher_where_were_ceos_during_war:0 "Where were the CEOs During the War?"
ENG_ET_thatcher_where_were_ceos_during_war_desc:0 "The investigation has begun.

While they remain in control of the House of Lords, they will continually over-scrutinize and amend legislation that England needs to preserve itself.

While it will raise a good deal of controversy, these individuals are largely still loyal to the old Royal Party, and they must be expelled from Parliament.\n\nIn order to prevent future problems arising from the unchecked appointments of life-peers, the power to appoint life-peers will no longer be granted to the Prime Minister; instead, the Prime Minister will select candidates for life peers once a year, who will then have to be approved by a special committee.

FEN_NDL_the_new_armed_forces_desc:0 "After a long fight, the people of England are finally free! Thanks to the efforts of thousands of brave Englishmen loyal to Queen and Country, we have prevailed over our misguided kin, and restored democracy and the legitimate monarch upon our blessed throne. Now, however, new challenges arise, and we'll need a powerful, reformed military to face this brave new world with any hope of remaining afloat...\n\nDecades of stagnation and economic downfall have left our armed forces underfunded, undertrained and underequipped. While our loyal militias have proven their bravery time and again, we will need a professional military. The Ministry of Defence shall undertake decisive reforms to ensure all the branches of the Royal Armed Forces are returned to their former glory!"
FEN_NDL_the_royal_navy_desc:0 "For more than three centuries, the Royal Navy had been our greatest military asset, and the main instrument for British supremacy over one fourth of the world. Hundreds of ships of the most modern designs used to sail across seas and oceans, protecting our colonies and reminding all of our majesty. Even more importantly, our fleet protected the Home Islands themselves from any would-be invaders.\n\nWhen London fell to the Germans, dozens of ships were sunk by enemy bombers or in desperate actions, and many others were seized by either the victorious foe or our own dominions when they declared their independence. What we have now is nothing but a mockery of our old glory, left to rot by corruption and inefficiency.\n\nThe time has come for a comprehensive reform. We shall rebuild the Royal Navy, larger and more powerful than before! We shall rule the waves once again!"
FEN_NDL_listen_to_the_experts_desc:0 "The old Royal Navy was centered around battleships. This proved to be a disaster against the Japanese and German fleets: the former launched hundreds of strikes from their large carriers, sinking most of our ships without even firing a shot from their own dreadnoughts, while the latter relied on their submarines to cripple our economy.\n\nIt is evident that the age of the battleship is over. Our American allies are ready to provide us with their best experts in naval aviation, and help us in developing new naval tactics centered around carriers. It will take time to adapt, as most of our naval staff has never commanded anything resembling a modern fleet, but the results will be worth the effort."
FEN_NDL_carrier_development_desc:0 "The American experts have arrived, and with them are dozens of naval engineers with great experience in designing ships.\n\nWhile we rebuild our naval industry, we can set up a joint naval design board so that our own shipbuilders can learn from their expertise. When they are ready, we'll be able to develop our own carrier designs. Forever renouncing the mighty battleship will be a hit to our national pride, but we already lost a war due to "pride", and we won't lose another one for the same bloody reason!"
FEN_NDL_new_carrier_planes_desc:0 "With our carrier designs ready, and the first hulls laid in our drydocks, we'll need a suitable complement of specialised aircraft to take off from these floating airfields. Carrier planes follow different rules compared to their land-based equivalents, and our designers must take all differences into account to ensure peak efficiency and battle performance: to this end, we shall form a designing board tasked with this very specific assignment.\n\nWhile we are in no hurry, as the first carriers won't be ready before at least two years, it would be wise to begin this project immediately, so that we may fill the technological gap separating England from the other naval powers that already have extensive experience in operating carriers and carrier-centered task forces."
FEN_NDL_investing_in_submarines_desc:0 "One of our greatest mistakes in the last war was underestimating the power of submarines. By the end of the conflict, thousands of convoys populated the abyss. No matter how many subs we sunk, more would take their place.\n\nWhile many old admirals condemn such a dishonorable way of fighting, we can no longer deny its efficacy. To this end, we shall study submarine designs and devise our own underwater menace: silent and deadly, this new addition to the Royal Navy will relentlessly stalk our foes until they lie in the cold embrace of the sea!"
FEN_NDL_american_models_desc:0 "Our American friends have a large and modern submarine force. Rather than wasting months, if not years, we could save ourselves the trouble and buy their designs. This will strengthen our mutual friendship, but will come at a hefty cost. The American Navy won't give up their most advanced weapons for pennies.\n\nOn the other hand, we could invest that money in newer dockyard facilities, increasing our shipbuilding capacity. It will take more time to get up to par, and our first submarines will surely be inferior to their counterparts in other parts of the world, but sometimes number is a force in itself."
FEN_NDL_a_functioning_navy_desc:0 "Finally, the bulk of our work is done! While it will take many more years, or even decades, before we can compare ourselves to the great Royal Navy of old, our naval staff agrees that we have made a significant step in the right direction.\n\nOur fleet has been reformed following the most modern doctrines, and already dozens of new, state-of-the-art ships protect our coast from foreign threats. We have come a long way, and the results are showing!"
FEN_NDL_like_father_like_son_desc:0 "The Prime Minister's father, Earl Jellicoe, was a hero of the Great War. He commanded the British fleet at the Battle of Jutland, where the Kaiserliche Marine was decimated and our supremacy over the North Sea secured. There, our mighty battleships and dreadnoughts pummeled their German counterparts into oblivion thanks to the power of large-caliber guns!\n\nOur leader knows that the Royal Navy became what it was thanks to its mastery of direct engagements and clever positioning, and the new fleet shall follow in the footsteps set by Admiral Jellicoe. As an added value, the sight of new, mighty battleships once again bearing the Union Jack will do wonders for propaganda..."
FEN_NDL_restoring_naval_titles_and_medals_desc:0 "In order to truly recover from the disaster that struck our beloved navy twenty years ago, we need to recover our past honor. So many brave sailors perished under the waves then, and so many others fought with determination against the German collaborators during our liberation: their names, as well as the legacy of the old Royal Navy, cannot - and will not - be forgotten.\n\nIn order to reward the loyalty and selfless sacrifice of our brave seamen, we shall restore the naval titles and medals awarded to our greatest heroes before the occupation of our homeland. The advancement of technology and doctrine is important, but what is a fleet without a soul? The Royal Navy is the greatest to have ever sailed across the seas, and we shall honor the timeless traditions followed by our ancestors: their example shall lead us to new great deeds!"
FEN_NDL_a_need_for_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships are still the undisputed Queens of the endless waters, and the true patriots among us know this well! The Royal Navy boasted the largest concentration of dreadnoughts in the entire world, and it was only due to us being left alone in our fight against both the Germans and the Japanese that we lost the seas: with our newfound freedom, we shall restore our former glory!\n\nFunds will be allocated to develop more modern battleships, equipped with state-of-the-art anti-aircraft batteries in order to fend off carrier-heavy fleets...\n\nThere are some within the naval command who complain that with the money spent into a single battleship we can commission an entire task force of a carrier and several screens, which - they claim - is more powerful and effective. Their claims are flawed, of course, and the Royal Navy will be back from its ashes like the Egyptian Phoenix!"
FEN_NDL_steel_from_america_desc:0 "In order to build a new battleship fleet, we need steel. Lots, and LOTS of steel. Britain once boasted the largest metallurgic industry in the world - a result of the industrial revolution and our colonial empire - but twenty years of occupation and exploitation by the Germans have reduced much of our industry to ashes, and the civil war finished the job.\n\nThanks to our overseas allies, however, we can make up for some of the damage. American industrial conglomerates have offered to invest into new steel production facilities near our most prominent naval dockyards, probably sensing the chance to earn large revenues from our military tenders: new, state-of-the art blast furnaces will be built with American money, and will provide a much-needed boost to our steel production."
FEN_NDL_for_you_father_desc:0 "Last week, Prime Minister Jellicoe visited his father's grave, as is his tradition every year. This time, however, he returned... different. His face showed a new determination, a purpose that many had seen during the civil war as he directed the foreign support for our cause.\n\nWe do not yet know what he has in mind, but it will surely be greatly beneficial to the United kingdom as a whole! We'll just have to wait and see..."
FEN_NDL_unveil_HMS_jellicoe_desc:0 "Today is a momentous day for the United Kingdom and the restored Royal Navy. After more than a year of tireless work in our most advanced drydocks, the HMS Jellicoe is ready to be launched: the Queen herself will bless the ship, and the event will be broadcasted nationwide, perhaps even worldwide!\n\nThis marvel of modern engineering will rival the greatest ships built in history, surpassing the Bismarck and even capable of challenging the Yamato! The HMS Jellicoe will serve as our new flagship from today onwards, until the day Jupiter himself strikes its hull with the might of his thunder!\n\nRule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!\nBritons never, never, never shall be slaves!"
FEN_NDL_the_royal_army_desc:0 "The Royal Army once counted millions under its service, its forces hailing from all parts of our far-reaching empire, from the Scottish Black Guard to the Indian Sepoys. Today, nothing remains but fading memories. Despite the bravery of our troops during the civil war, we can't deny that most of our current forces are made up of untrained militias.\n\nIf we are to defend ourselves and our newfound freedom from those who would seek to steal it once again, we need to reform our armed forces, and decide on a new course for our doctrine. A debate has already started in the General Staff, and we can only wait and see how it develops..."
FEN_NDL_the_issue_of_conscription_desc:0 "When we fought against the collaborators, we needed every able-bodied man to fight for freedom. As such, we had to enact conscription, and thousands of brave young Englishmen died in the name of the legitimate Queen: we shall never forget their sacrifice!\n\nWith peace returned to the country, and reconstruction underway, many within the civilian government ask for conscription to be lifted, and for our army to return a purely volunteer force. A conscripted force - they say - will be far less effective than a professional one, and much more costly.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some in the High Command arguing for conscription to remain. Our enemies - especially the Reich - are still very much alive, and having a large army would surely act as a deterrent.\n\nAs the legitimate Queen's government, it falls upon us to address the matter."
FEN_NDL_hunting_with_claude_desc:0 "Despite his retirement, Claude Auchinleck is still an influential figure in English politics, and his wisdom is appreciated, even by his rivals. Our Prime Minister is especially fond of his mentor, and the two have forged a friendship through years of underground resistance and a civil war.\n\nHoping to relax for a bit from the hardships of his official duties, George shall go on a hunting trip with Claude, where they'll be able to let go of their strict discipline and official roles for a couple days. Who knows, perhaps the old general will let a couple pearls of wisdom slip from his net..."
FEN_NDL_the_front_of_the_shield_desc:0 "Auchinleck is right. Our army should focus on protecting our shores from enemy attacks rather than risking everything in overseas adventures: to protect the United Kingdom, we need a large defensive force capable of rapid mobilization.\n\nOur General Staff is fully in support of what they call "a sound strategy" to protect our homeland. Perhaps our forces won't be as highly trained as the American Marines or the German Panzergrenadiers, but they'll make up for it with their numbers and their dedication!"
FEN_NDL_lessons_from_the_invasion_desc:0 "The German conquest of Great Britain was the single greatest defeat in our history. We have spent years analyzing the causes of this disaster, and our staff agrees that the main reason has been our over-reliance on the Royal Navy: when the fleet was lost, the Germans landed a stone's throw from London, and the Home Guard was too slow to react.\n\nWe won't make the same mistake twice. Should any enemy come to our shores, they'll find that the entirety of the British people is ready to fight tooth and nail for every bloody inch of our country, until the end!"
FEN_NDL_a_defense_force_desc:0 "As Machiavelli once said, "Wars begin when you will, but do not end when you please."\n\nWars of aggression have always backfired against those who wage it, and our country has already been ravaged by an enemy invasion. In order to protect our nation from any would-be conqueror, we shall focus our efforts solely on protecting our sacred soil: our troops will be drilled in defensive tactics, and fortifications will protect our coasts and cities from all those who would dare attack us.\n\nNot only that, but we'll also foster a strong sense of duty in our soldiers. From the highest officer to the lowest militiaman, all will know how important their sacrifice is, and how many will be saved by their bravery: we have already lost too much, we shall never let it happen again!"
FEN_NDL_meeting_with_stirling_desc:0 "Among the many officers of the reformed General Staff, David Stirling - remembered as the founder of the short-lived Special Air Service - has rather... peculiar views on the future of the Royal Army. He spent years reflecting on our defeat in the war, and he has come to a rather surprising conclusion: our army failed to defeat the Germans not because it wasn't big enough, but because it was too large. Poor coordination, lack of training and subpar logistics were the result of an excessive reliance on conscription, and weighed heavily on our performance in the conflict.\n\nTo address this issue, he proposes radical reforms. The new Royal Army should - according to Stirling - focus on small, highly trained strike teams, each unit an expert in a single aspect of warfare: he claims with specialized support and state-of-the-art equipment, these units can inflict much more damage to the enemy than average soldiers, at a fraction of the cost. While such ideas seem to clash with the majority of the General Staff, it would be wise to meet Stirling anyway."
FEN_NDL_the_edge_of_the_sword_desc:0 "In the end, Stirling is right. Rebuilding our army to be like what it was during the last war would be akin to recreating all the conditions that brought to our defeat. Stirling's reforms are exactly what we need to show the world that we can return to the forefront of innovation even in military matters.\n\nOur new army will be much smaller than before, and centered around small, well-equipped, highly-trained and autonomous units, tailored to a single task. These small units will move fast and strike hard, destroying our enemies before they even have the chance to react. In theory, this should allow our army to deal crippling blows to the foe; in practice... we'll simply have to wait and see how it goes."
FEN_NDL_lessons_from_the_SAS_desc:0 "The Special Air Service was Stirling's own creation during the last war. Despite our defeat, they nonetheless proved themselves to be an extremely effective strike force: in several successful operations, they inflicted heavy losses upon the enemy at a fraction of their cost in human lives and equipment.\n\nOur new army will apply the lessons of the SAS - speed, surprise, organization and powerful offensives - at a general level, effectively transforming the entire Royal Army into teams of commandos! We'll strike at the enemy from a hundred different points, and destroy them before they can even hear the sound of their death..."
FEN_NDL_an_elite_force_desc:0 "It took us months to fully reshape the Royal Army according to Stirling's vision, but it is finally done. Our new land army is an extremely professional and effective force.\n\nThanks to complete integration between the various branches of the Royal Armed Forces, our troops will strike with the strength of a hundred men each, moving at lightning speed and destroying their target with precision.\n\nOf course, we have to be careful. As all small tools, this new army is delicate, and it requires extreme coordination and competence in order to be able to operate at full efficiency. We are confident that our officers are up to the task."
FEN_NDL_the_royal_air_force_desc:0 "Once the undisputed ruler of the skies, the Royal Air Force is but a shadow of its former glory. The harsh conditions imposed by the peace treaty, and twenty years of neglect and economic downturn have transformed our air force into a comatose patient.\n\nEven now, all we have is some old birds left by the collaborators, and whatever our friends in Canada and the United States could spare for us. If we are to re-establish a fully-functional air force, we'll have to rebuild everything from scratch."
FEN_NDL_jets_are_the_future_desc:0 "Jet airplanes are the future of air combat. Far faster than any prop plane, they can climb higher than anything in the sky. During the occupation, the Royal Air Force was barred from having anything resembling the newest German models, which means we'll have to start from the basics.\n\nWe should immediately establish a research group to analyze jet engine designs, and then teach our best engineers how to build and maintain them. It will be difficult, and we'll need the help of our allies, but there is much to gain!"
FEN_NDL_american_models_jets_desc:0 "With our lack knowledge on jet airplanes, we have no idea of what kind of airframe would best suit such a powerful engine. With the looming risk of producing flying caskets for our test pilots, we'll need to rely on our American allies once more to avoid unnecessary problems.\n\nBy buying some of their outdated designs and having our research team study them, we'll soon be able to fully understand the most important concepts of jet flight, and then apply it to our own domestically-produced airplanes."
FEN_NDL_improving_upon_the_engine_desc:0 "Now that we understand the basic functioning of a jet engine, and already have a small jet force, we can slowly start improving our designs. Modern advancements in the field allow our technicians to tweak engines and airframes to allow for greater speed without greater risks.\n\nOf course, we'll need help from our friends in the alliance to fully understand the scope of our research, but we'll make sweeping advances in a short time, allowing us to fill the gap between us and modern air combat!"
FEN_NDL_harris_was_right_desc:0 "Arthur Harris, also known as "Bomber Harris" by both friends and foes, was one of the most prominent officers of the Royal Air Force during the last war. A proponent of strategic bombing, he was convinced of the necessity to break the enemy's home front: factories, roads, ports, even civilian homes and schools were all legitimate targets to force the enemy to bend, or burn.\n\nIt's time we forge our own path in the air, and Bomber Harris is the man for this. Even though he couldn't put his theory into action due to our untimely defeat, this time we won't hesitate, and bury anyone daring to go to war against us under tons of explosives!"
FEN_NDL_invest_in_bomber_research_desc:0 "Bombers have changed since the last war. Rather than slow-moving fortresses bristling with machine guns, today's bombers are high-flying monsters with deadly cargo: napalm, phosphorous, even atomic payloads can utterly devastate entire cities in mere minutes.\n\nIt's imperative that we update our bomber fleet to the latest designs. Our enemies will tremble when they see our air fleet! Who knows, perhaps one day we'll see Germania burn..."
FEN_NDL_a_request_from_harris_desc:0 "Bomber Harris has come to us with a request. He needs a large amount of funds for a personal project, one that - he says - has been his constant focus ever since the end of the war.\n\nKnowing his preference for strategic bombers, there may be some value in listening to him. The General Staff will meet in the next days to examine his proposal, and decide whether to allocate the requested funds."
FEN_NDL_better_aerodynamics_desc:0 "The engine is the most important part in any airplane, but the airframe comes in a close second. An ill-designed airframe will break when put under stress, while a heavy one will only hinder performance.\n\nThanks to our allies' help, our engineering department is confident that they can greatly refine the airframes of our jets, improving aerodynamics and granting higher speed and agility."
FEN_NDL_a_professional_air_force_desc:0 "With our latest advancements in the fields of jet engines, aerodynamics and air doctrine, we can finally claim to have a fully-professional air force. Thanks to the help of our steadfast allies, our pilots enjoy the best training and the most modern equipment available.\n\nIt may take some time before we return to our old glory, but the day when the Royal Air Force can once again contest the skies of Europe grows ever closer. We'll one day dominate the skies as we used to rule the oceans!"
FEN_NDL_develop_better_engines_desc:0 "The General Staff has reviewed Harris's proposal, and found it extremely promising. He shall receive all the funding he needs, as long as he also focuses his attention on new, improved engines for our bombers.\n\nWith war assuming more and more a trans-continental value, it is of the utmost importance that our long-range aircraft are able to cross seas and oceans if necessary. Our enemies will fear us from Germania to Tokyo!"
FEN_NDL_a_british_air_force_desc:0 "While our erstwhile allies have offered to help us rebuild our air force, we don't need their help. We battled German Stukas in the skies of London before the Americans even thought about helping us, and we'll do so again if the need arises.\n\nWe can't expect others to save us, and for this reason, we can ultimately count only on ourselves. The Royal Air Force will be a shining example of British ingenuity and combat skill: if we fail, it will be our own fault, but if we succeed, it will be our triumph, and ours alone!"
FEN_NDL_secret_intelligence_service_desc:0 "No contradiction greater than Kim Philby can be found. Philby is a firm believer in the absolute annihilation of the enemies of the working class. He also leads the Secret Intelligence Service better than anyone else could. To remove him would be near-impossible and would be a major blow to the young Service. We must treat this affair delicately, like capturing a butterfly: we can neither tighten our grip too hard nor slacken up too much."
FEN_NDL_dealing_with_philby_desc:0 "After careful internal surveillance and intel gathering within MI6 from our most loyal elements, we have reached an impasse on a possible strategy, as nearly every option is a double edged sword. Remove him to assure loyal leadership, yet inevitably get a weaker leader facing a leftist revolt? Defang him by removing his guns and support, worsening efficiency and still provoking his ire? Or simply keep an eye on him, allowing him to run the Service as efficiently as possible...yet perhaps not allowing us to halt his influence until it's too late? We need to make a decision on how we will handle this matter."
FEN_NDL_mi6_is_for_the_queen_desc:0 "Philby, bereft of loyal men, will have no more influence than the average Communist philistine. By requiring an oath of absolute loyalty to the queen, we will be able to prevent leftists from joining our venerated service. Which one of them would truly be more interested in serving the queen than decapitating her?"
FEN_NDL_cutting_on_the_guns_desc:0 "The SIS has a formidable weapons stockpile, built up under Philby's orders but tolerated for its role in a global armaments network, and the operations we still need to carry out on our own soil. However, it is clear that the more militarized our Service is, the more dangerous Philby's leadership is. By slashing down this arsenal, there will be much less of a danger that we suddenly find ourselves dealing with rebellious red militias both at home and abroad. This may hurt effectiveness in the short term, but if one wants to shoot at enemies they really should be joining the Army."

Through two world wars, the two greatest English-speaking nations of the world have been tried and tested like no other grand alliance.\n\nIt is only natural that now, in our hour of need, we should look to the United States once more as a partner and friend.\n\nSurely, we can restore the good old nature and the good old humour of an alliance not yet forgotten."
FEN_NDL_IT_ties_with_canada_desc:0 "Through all the hardships of the past 20 years- the defeats, the invasion, the end of the war- Canada has stood by Free England, in whatever form it has taken. When Tobruk and the Suez Canal were lost, she remained loyal. When Britain itself was invaded, she remained loyal. Through decades of oppression and hardship, she remained loyal.

FEN_NDL_IT_OFN_bases_desc:0 "Our army is not in any state to fight off a counterattack by the Germans, should it come to that. We need more men, more equipment, and more time to organize our troops. The OFN can provide all three, if we give them the rights to station bases at strategic locations in England. While this technically violates our sovereignty, everything has its cost- and a few well-armed Yanks on English soil is worth never having to endure such calamities as we have."

FEN_NDL_IT_the_dragon_to_the_west_desc:0 "With the chaotic state of Europe and the world, a divided Isles is a doomed Isles. Wales, with its rich coal and coastal resources, would be invaluable to reasserting our national strength. We also should not forget our nearly 1000-year-long history of unity with Wales. Their independence is a minor aberration, to be corrected with force, if necessary. In the meantime, our diplomatic channels will be buzzing with anticipation of a peaceful union."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_government_will_do_the_talking_desc:0 " Fortunately for us, the young Welsh nation, shuttled from crisis to crisis, found itself run by a stable and democratic government. Therefore, we look with much anticipation towards our upcoming unification talks.\n\nThe issue of setting up these talks will be key, with such a multitude of factors to consider. Arch-conservatives here in England will despise the appearance of concessions, while most of Wales, even their "moderates," do not wish to see their burgeoning cultural independence quashed. We must offend nobody and please practically everyone. God be with us."
FEN_NDL_IT_y_mabb_darogans_pride_desc:0 "The insane bastard, Julian Cayo-Evans, has been running our western neighbor for over a year now. In his youthful bouts of insanity, he truly believes little Wales can stand against the inevitable tides of unification. Down with him!\n\nWe shall immediately begin preparations for an invasion. We will crush any insolent pests skittering through the countryside, and within days our armored corps will be in Cardiff, to be greeted as liberators. Cayo has, no doubt, built a vicious and fanatical following, but they are hardly indicative of the average Welshman. A United Britain is closer than ever."
FEN_NDL_IT_welcome_home_desc:0 "The fraught road to reunification is over. Wales, standing for just two decades as an independent...well, perhaps power isn't the right word. They existed, for certain. But no longer. Now, as before the war, the great peoples of Wales and England are one. No more scheming nationalists and communists, no more volatile shocks from global coal prices. Now, everywhere from Cardiff to the distant northern hills near Snowdonia shall be under London's benevolent dominion."
FEN_NDL_IT_on_terror_and_blackshirts_desc:0 "Decades of isolation have developed curious and dangerous pathologies among many a Welshman, more so than we had first anticipated. Our garrisons in the countryside have faced dozens of bombings and sniper attacks, and we are almost certain that more than one group is at play.\n\nTo pacify our foes, we need to use both the sword and the pen. For those who viciously attack our soldiers, there will of course be no mercy...unless they surrender. We must specifically track and kill the masterminds, finding their identities no matter the cost. All the while, our crack teams of journalists will be ensuring that our campaigns against the enemy will appear as benevolent as possible. Soon, there will be nobody left to even fathom Welsh resistance."
FEN_NDL_IT_two_brothers_united_desc:0 "At last, Wales has calmed to governable levels. Few gunshots ring out even in the most sparsely populated of regions, as citizens slowly resume their normal routines. This process was no easy feat, yet here we stand over a stable union of nations. At last, this brief divorce ends, all while Wale's coasts and coal reserves open to our shared use. Soon, none shall trifle with Britain."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_light_in_the_north_desc:0 "We have successfully consolidated our power in England, and it is time to move onto greener pastures. One of the hurdles we must jump before unifying Britain is Scotland. Unlike our forefathers three hundred years ago, this Scotland has prepared for invasion since its inception. Since the end of the last great war, a rivalry has developed between us. Now that the Collaborators and their allies have been disposed of, we can talk again of unification."
FEN_NDL_IT_a_door_wide_open_desc:0 "After much consideration, Scotland has agreed to begin talks with us about reunification. However, Scottish nationalism is quite rooted in the country and it may take some dedication and elbow grease to install British nationalism and pride. There are a few hardliners in the government who are opposed to this idea entirely, especially the Scottish National Party, who ruled the country for most of its short recent history. Most, however, have agreed to talks - but it will take encouragement."
FEN_NDL_IT_a_door_slam_shut_desc:0 "It seems the Scots didn't take too kindly to the idea of reunification. Our diplomatic team was turned away in Edinburgh after making their intentions clear. While this seems like an opportunity taken from us, it is still possible to return Scotland to the fold. We have no choice now but invasion. While we may be in the history books as conquerors, we have done this for our children and their children so that they will see a united Britain."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_union_jack_flies_desc:0 "After our efforts, the Union Jack flies once again over Scotland. It has taken time, but now one of the most beautiful places on the British Isles is under our control. Their people are also under our control, and some have been more unruly than expected. However we have placed small contingents of soldiers in Scottish cities and towns to ensure peace. Talks have begun about a Scottish Parliament that will both serve in the House of Lords in conjunction with their own parliament based in Holyrood. This is the first step to make sure that they are seen as equal. Now the English flag flies next to the Scottish flag, united."
FEN_NDL_IT_the_bagpipes_sing_no_more_desc:0 "Scottish nationalism is an issue we have been facing ever since we had brought Scotland back into the fold. Terrorist attacks have begun on our soldiers, with some of the old guard comparing it to the North Irish War nearly forty years ago.\n\nWhile most of the Scottish people have been cooperative towards us, it appears that we may need to use a much heavier hand."
FEN_NDL_IT_rule_britannia_desc:0 "We have done it.\n\nAfter many trials, we have unified the British Isles. Our power is now consolidated and we are once again the rulers of Scotland and Wales. Finally, we can reclaim our mantle of Great Britain, lost for twenty years. Now, we can begin to unite our people together and make our country a great power again. We are a part of the free world, and will remain so for the next hundred years.\n\nRule Britannia!"

FEN_NDL_econ_rebuilding_an_economy_desc:0 "Homelessness, hunger, sickness. Such are the conditions left to hundreds of thousands of patriotic Englishmen after the violence of our civil war. Even the traditionally comfortable classes like business owners and landlords have seen their wealth dry up, leaving a gaping hole where an economy once existed. If we hope to stand on two feet, we must mobilize all resources possible to bring stability and comfort in the daily lives of all citizens, rich and poor."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_poor_desc:0 "London's ruins are a sorry sight: emaciated children, haggard families, rampant crime. And this is the center of our wealth! Imagine the situation in the rural villages. We cannot move forward with so many people, so many children, in dire economic straits. As of now, our most immediate goal is to provide the necessities to all those left in destitution. Three meals a day, clean water in a heated home, basic healthcare: these are our promises to all those crushed by the violence of the civil war."
FEN_NDL_econ_improving_social_programs_desc:0 "The legacy of the fascist collaborators is one of scraps to the poor. With the current state of our economy, we must immediately rectify this callousness. We will find the money, whatever the means: nationalize, tax, expropriate if absolutely necessary, all for uplifting the poor. We can't tread too hard on the individuals with some sums of wealth...but we can cut them down just a peg to feed the hungry and house the homeless. "
FEN_NDL_econ_cheaper_housing_desc:0 "As we have picked up our social programs, there has been some blowback from the private sector. Nowhere has this been more acute than the well-organized associations of landlords across England. They protest loudly about the "communist" proposal to create public housing. More productively, they have worked with some of our social-democratic and liberal colleagues to draft up a plan for cheaper housing. Via public-private partnerships, we can encourage these landlords to build thousands of new housing units with certain regulations imposed, keeping public housing to a marginal level."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_housing_act_desc:0 "Our new Housing Act, built in consultation with all parties affected from landlords to homeless, is a major step towards making housing affordable to everyone. By using some of our funds to subsidize housing development, setting caps on rent, and requiring certain standards to be met for all new projects, we will move much closer to giving everyone a roof over their heads. Perhaps one day, everyone can have not just a place to lay their head, but a place they proudly call home."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_jobless_desc:0 "As the English Civil War has drawn to a close, we are now free to focus on economic recovery as well as our political situation. So far, the data is dire. We must begin to reconnect with those who have been turned out by the war, and those who have lost their jobs amidst the ravages of the conflict. After we have assessed the status of our economy from an employment perspective, we can begin to propose programmes and special government action. This might involve some wrangling of party factions, but surely we can all come together to rebuild our country and get England working again."
FEN_NDL_econ_creating_more_jobs_in_the_north_desc:0 "Even before the Civil War, the northern parts of England struggled due to cuts in government funding and projects. No government member wanted to associate with such a rebellious region, and so employment and growth lagged behind the south. Heavy fighting did not improve the situation, and now infrastructure and housing are a significant problem. Now that the civil war is over and we face less pressure from Germany, we can begin to push more funding towards these left-behind areas and help them to, once more, become the industrial heart of England."
FEN_NDL_econ_deal_with_bosses_desc:0 "While we do not intend to give our country over to the interests of large capitalist institutions, their help is necessary in revitalizing our economy and ensuring that we can recover from the war. We can hand out vital projects (with ample government funding) for national recovery that will get big business on our side, the people happy and working, and the nation ready for the future. We will, of course, remain careful to avoid a descent into corporate cronyism, and there will be oversight of these projects to make sure that they are fulfilling our expectations."
FEN_NDL_econ_what_to_do_with_foreign_jobs_desc:0 "We still have an enormous trade dependence on the United States and the rest of the OFN, and some of our members have grown uncomfortable with the numbers of jobs being "shipped overseas" to these nations. Furthermore, there are many Americans here in England that many say are taking away jobs from hard-working English men and women. The more liberal elements of our party maintain that such trade is necessary, and that economic ties with the Americans further our national security interests. We must find a way to defuse tensions on both sides regarding this vital economic issue before the complaints boil over."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_trade_desc:0 "Our dependence on trade with the United States has been both a historical weakness and a vital artery. During the Second World War, our failure to defend this trade cost us dearly. During the English Civil War, it was one of few avenues we had to acquire food and manufactured goods from abroad. Now that the Germans no longer have control over who we can and cannot trade with, we must reopen this vital trade partnership. Surely, the Americans will be amenable to such a proposal...?"
FEN_NDL_econ_focusing_on_the_OFN_desc:0 "The Organization of Free Nations is our greatest ally. Just as they help us militarily, we can help them economically. We shall expand our trade operations in OFN member nations, especially the United States, and in doing so we shall improve our own economy. "
FEN_NDL_econ_expansion_into_free_europe_desc:0 "While Spain and France may not be the most democratic nations, they are somewhat free from the grip of the German Reich. Alongside these nations, we can also expand trade into Scandinavia and the Balkans. We can improve our economy and increase our influence in Europe at the same time."
FEN_NDL_econ_trade_agreements_with_italy_desc:0 "Italy's government is vastly different to ours, but that isn't important right now. Regardless of ideology, Italy hasn't had good relations with Germany for almost 2 decades now, making them a bulwark against German expansion. If we sign some trade agreements with the Italian Government, we may be able to sway them closer to our side."
FEN_NDL_econ_into_a_new_phase_desc:0 "Now that all of our immediate economic issues have been dealt with, we can move on to social matters.

FEN_NDL_econ_the_business_support_act_desc:0 "We shall attempt to pass a bill through Parliament for the betterment of England.

FEN_NDL_econ_the_fight_for_healthcare_desc:0 "Many in England believe that the fight for healthcare was lost forever almost two decades ago, when the Royal Party took power. We shall revive this idea and move towards a comprehensive healthcare plan. While it may not be perfect, this new system will be a step forward towards a greater society."
FEN_NDL_econ_better_pay_for_doctors_desc:0 "The battle for healthcare starts with the most important figures in the field: doctors. We cannot expect to bring healthcare to all if the supply of doctors is so limited. By increasing their pay we can encourage more individuals to pursue the field of medicine, allowing us to bring better quality healthcare to all."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_NHS_act_desc:0 "We shall now attempt to pass a new act through parliament: the National Healthcare Service Act. While this may not be a popular act to many in Parliament, with the Patriots denouncing the act as treasonous and with the Socialists decrying the act for not going far enough, the majority of the people of England will support us. It shall provide a more affordable and accessible service to those in the middle and lower classes, as is our goal."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_costs_of_education_desc:0 "If we are to provide affordable education to all members of society, we must first reduce the costs of education wherever we can. We shall start with the most wasteful aspects of education such as unnecessary and outdated textbooks and other equipment. With any luck, this, alongside education grants and subsidies, shall reduce the costs of schooling to much more affordable levels."
FEN_NDL_econ_more_equipment_for_teachers_desc:0 "With the costs of education successfully reduced, we must now increase the quality of said education. An obvious and glaring shortcoming in the education system is the lack of proper equipment that many teachers are facing. We shall have to rectify this mistake."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_education_costs_act_desc:0 "A new act shall be sent through to Parliament. The Education Costs Act seeks to, as the name makes clear, address the costs of education. While this may cost the government a large sum of money, in the long run, the move should pay off by improving the academic base of our nation and bringing England into a more intelligent future."
FEN_NDL_econ_fixing_the_tax_system_desc:0 "Calling the English tax system broken would be an understatement of magnificent proportions. The amount of unnecessary and unhelpful taxes levied upon the people is astounding, and has hamstrung the economy at a time when it needed as much help as it could get. We must reform the system so that we can properly strengthen and reinforce our economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_cutting_useless_taxes_desc:0 "Too much of our inherited taxation system does more harm than good. We even have taxes that cost more to keep track of than they are worth in revenue. We shall ease the people's tax burden by removing some of these taxes, but not so many that we effectively neuter the government. In doing so we shall not only increase consumer spending but we shall also increase support from the people."
FEN_NDL_econ_work_more_desc:0 "Calling the English tax system broken would be an understatement of magnificent proportions. The amount of unnecessary and unhelpful taxes levied upon the people is astounding and can only have helped to hamstring the economy in a time when it needed as much help as it could get. We must reform the system so that we can properly strengthen and reinforce the economy."
FEN_NDL_econ_and_what_about_the_rich_desc:0 "We must also decide what we are to do about income and wealth inequality, with regards to the richer members of society. The SLP would have us be rid of them completely, taxing their wealth to extortionate levels. The Royal Party would have us bow down to them, and give them free reign to exploit the poor and hoard their wealth. We will go for a more sensible middle route."
FEN_NDL_econ_the_groundwork_laid_desc:0 "We have done it. The impossible, Herculean task of successfully rebuilding the economy and reforming society. But we are not finished yet. There still remains much work to be done if we are to fulfill the promise of our ideals, but we can truthfully say that we have made England a better place."

These fortifications will ensure that any enemy plane that enters our air space is met with a wall of Flak and Anti-Air Missiles. This combined with our new air force will ensure that the Luftwaffe never again threatens an English home or factory again."
FEN_SLP_Military_mines_of_the_explosive_kind_desc:0 "Britain's pride used to be its navy, but as things currently stand we are outclassed and outgunned. However, a bomb doesn't care if it's a top of the line warship that it destroys - it destroys it all the same. To protect our lands, we must litter the seas with mines. Improved and more efficient mine-laying operations and more explosive and destructive mines are the order of the day.\n\nIf we can't defend Britain with a fleet, we'll make damn well sure that no one else can invade us with one."
FEN_SLP_Military_improving_the_radars_desc:0 "A great part of defeating the enemy is knowing where they are and where they are going to be. Though the Germans were able to pierce through in the War, Radar was such an incredible boon for our forces that it enabled us to hold off their assault for far longer than we'd ever hoped, even if we ultimately failed.\n\nImproved Radar systems and stations all across the Isles will let us know far in advance whether or not an enemy intends to attack, and give us the appropriate time to mobilise an effective response. This time, we'll have them by the scruffs of their necks."
FEN_SLP_Military_deeper_and_more_silent_desc:0 "Our navy is not even a shade of what it used to be, but we have to ask ourselves - what good did it do us? Britain still lost the War to the German wolf-packs and superior naval tactics. As such, an expansive grand navy is surplus to requirements - what we need is to focus on submarine warfare. As assassins kill kings, so too do subs fell battleships and carriers. Britain's navy shall not be grand, but it shall be feared."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_new_generation_of_subs_desc:0 "In our ongoing efforts to emphasise submarine warfare, we've reached a barrier - the simple technical limitations of our current models. There's only so much that can be improved upon before the very nature of what we're improving on becomes the limiting factor. To overcome this, we must design and produce new, better generations of submarines - ones that can delve deeper, travel further, strike silently and slink away into the night with our enemies none the wiser."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_1943_desc:0 "By all accounts the German invasion in 1943 should have been impossible. Operation Sealion should have ended in miserable failure and the complete destruction of the Kriegsmarine. But it didn't. Instead it saw the Royal Navy defeated and the British Isles successfully invaded for the first time since William the Conqueror. Where did it all go wrong? We must examine those dark days closely, to learn what we can from them and ensure that such an invasion never again reaches our shores."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_fortifications_desc:0 "For nearly one thousand years before the War, no enemy force stepped foot on British soil. Our defeat in the war came in part from our belief that no force could. We were wrong. From Dover to Bristol, we must build expansive fortification networks along our coastlines, so that if an enemy lands on the Isle, their visit shall not be for very long, and will certainly not be a pleasant one."
FEN_SLP_Military_a_navy_to_protect_the_trade_desc:0 "The burden of the British public's agricultural demands have far outgrown the Isle's ability to sustain them. We've seen this before, in the War. Rationing, suffering, starvation on the Island; when German ships sank British convoys, the people went hungry, and eventually broke.\n\nWe may remake Britain into an impenetrable Fortress, but all you need to do to take a Fortress is to starve it out. We will not accept this. Our navy's top priority will be the securing of vital imports to our people. Never again shall a Briton starve in their own home."
FEN_SLP_Military_escorting_the_convoys_desc:0 "In order to ensure we never have to suffer shortages of the material kind nor any shortages of food and other supplies, we shall purchase and build more convoy seacraft. This shall allow us to increase in trade as well as giving us a backup supply of convoys in the event of an emergency."
FEN_SLP_Military_stronger_torpedoes_desc:0 "It was made very clear by German trade interdiction during the second world war that torpedoes are an exceptionally effective method of damaging and sinking ships. By developing more powerful and longer-ranged torpedoes we shall allow our smaller ships and submarines to punch well above their weight and sink the ships of any nation that dares threaten us.\n\nIt is not the size of the ship in the fight that matters, but the size of the torpedoes in the ship."
FEN_SLP_Military_improving_upon_the_armor_desc:0 "It has been said that "The best defence is a good offence". This is ridiculous as it is very clear to all in the naval military field that the best defence is six inches of solid steel! If our ships can last longer in the fight then they would be much more able to not only survive but also sink enemy ships and win battles. To this end, we shall research and outfit our ships with the latest and strongest armour available."
FEN_SLP_Military_better_carriers_desc:0 "Ever since the massive naval battles of the Pacific in the Second World War, it has been clear that the future of naval warfare belongs to the carrier. Floating airfields able to dispense dozens of aircraft to support in naval engagements, carriers are the pinnacle of naval design. If we are to survive in a hostile modern Europe we will need a modern navy to defend us. We shall build more and better aircraft carriers to maybe restore the great British Navy of old."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_naval_planes_desc:0 "A carrier without planes is simply a floating slab of metal, a liability, a waste of resources. We need naval aircraft to populate our carriers and our naval aircraft designs are severely out of date. We shall divert our efforts and resources towards a modern aircraft force for our carrier fleets.\n\nWe shall control the skies, and through them the seas."
FEN_SLP_Military_american_designs_desc:0 "It is a simple and unfortunate fact that our designs and designers are decades out of date, due in no small part to our loss in the Second World War and subsequent occupation. While we could attempt to develop our own designs it may be much more effective to licence American designs, not to mention faster. Should the Americans refuse we shall be back to where we started with the additional loss of our dignity."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_trade_secured_desc:0 "Now with our fleets modernised and fully equipped, the might of the new British Navy shall be feared and respected worldwide, just as it was in days of yore. As well as this, our new naval forces will be able to ensure that our trade is protected and secured. We shall never have to suffer under another naval blockade and our people shall not go hungry again. Once again we Britannia rules the waves.\n\nRule Britannia."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_army_desc:0 "With the war won, we need to look forward to improving our military using the lessons we learned during all that hard fighting. While our troops evidently performed admirably, there are significant improvements that we can make, particularly in heavy weaponry and organization. Let's create a bigger, better, and more professional army to protect the security of our new England. We shall forever defend our revolution, on our island!\n\nAnd, if possible, spread it further..."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_the_ECW_desc:0 "While we can create a fairly large army, it is likely that in future wars we will be somewhat outnumbered, as we were in the ECW. No amount of conscription or militia troops can change the fact that we are a small island against the whole of Europe. However, we adapted to this in the ECW by using strong, concentrated strike forces to break enemy lines and exploit weaknesses.\n\n We can use veteran troops as a shock division and use the SAS to complement them in disorganizing enemy units and breaking cohesion in their rear areas. This will mean that we may be outnumbered, but we will never be outgunned at the place and time we choose. Jerry may think himself a master of these tactics, but we will show him a thing or two about English doggedness and strength in adversity."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_issue_of_conscription_desc:0 "In both World Wars, conscription has been quite controversial, and it remains so even today. We are a small and industrious nation, and the more men we keep in the factories and off the front lines, the better. However, there are wolves at the door, and some of the hardliners are pressing hard that we need every pair of hands we can get to defend our revolution. Should we fold to them, the government may become more unpopular, but if we don't, who knows what future we have?\n\nIt is time to make a choice about what size our military really needs to be."
FEN_SLP_Military_keeping_the_militias_desc:0 "The militias were a critical part of our victory in the ECW- they provided much needed manpower to hold the line against attacks and could support our regular troops in their assaults. While they may not have the firepower or training of the proposed shock divisions, they are just as necessary to creating a functional army, and we would surely be fools to throw away what we have built during the civil war. We should keep the militias to ensure parity of numbers with larger nations that we may have to fight, and to provide a solid shield against further aggression towards our revolution."
FEN_SLP_Military_effective_strike_forces_desc:0 "The logical conclusion of our concentration policy is to make each division capable of supporting itself in these aggressive actions. Therefore, each division should be sufficiently equipped to make a local breakthrough in its sector. While this means a significant amount of equipment will have to be requisitioned, it will give us an aggressive spirit that cannot be matched, as each divisional commander knows that he can strike the enemy where he is weakest. The initiative will always be with us, and we can choose the field of battle as it suits our lads. Tally ho!"
FEN_SLP_Military_the_armed_union_debates_desc:0 "Unions are naturally a central part of our revolution, but arming them could radicalize the workers. Normally, this would be a perfectly good idea, and would afford the average worker a good deal of power, but the stability of the government (and, by extension, the army) is surely a better defence of the revolution than some armed laborers.\n\n However, our precarious international situation might mean that we need everyone who can bear arms to do so, should a crisis erupt. The more familiar the people are with arms now, the better they will be as real soldiers later."
FEN_SLP_Military_every_worker_a_soldier_desc:0 "No one can doubt the bravery of our militias, and they played a key role in beating back the reactionary forces that wanted to stop our revolution dead in its tracks. However, the most talented in the militia should probably be shuffled off towards the regular army, as they can benefit more from better training and equipment. Such integration will allow us to better defend ourselves, should the time come, by giving us a reliable reserve of experienced and talented troops to draw upon. We can then supplement the militia's ranks once more, and create an ironclad defence."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_tank_models_desc:0 "In order to really achieve a breakthrough, we will need tanks as well as experienced infantry. As of now, our tank arm is hopelessly outdated, and we must integrate new technologies and designs to make sure that our armored formations can meet and defeat every new threat they face on a modern battlefield, including newer anti-tank rockets, mines, and other tanks. Once we have the firepower to match, we can create a real modern army with great striking power."
FEN_SLP_Military_thunder_and_lightning_desc:0 "The next war will be thoroughly modern, and that means we need the firepower to match. Our artillery designs are too old and dated to be of much use on quickly moving battlefields, and so we must push forward new and innovative designs that will give our soldiers the edge in a tough fight. Combined with our new tactics and experienced troops, this will give us a winning formula when the next challenge comes."
FEN_SLP_Military_an_army_to_protect_the_revolution_desc:0 "We have the tanks! We have the weapons! We have the soldiers! With the core of our army complete, we have a professional, battle-hardened army with the best equipment in Europe. Our safety, and the safety of our revolution, is now assured. When the time comes, they'll fight for the revolution, and they'll win!"
FEN_SLP_Military_the_new_socialist_air_force_desc:0 "After the Second World War, our proud air force was entirely dismantled. To defend our island effectively, we need air superiority over English skies. Since we barely have a leg to stand on now, we can totally rebuild our air force from the ground up, while sticking to the principles that once made our air force the envy of the world. We will need new planes, new pilots, and new air ports, but a revitalized air force would be the backbone of our new armed forces."
FEN_SLP_Military_more_pilots_desc:0 "While planes are a rather important part of any air force, they are not the only things required. It is our pilots that will give us the advantage, even over a numerically superior opponent. We need to look at all the talent in England to pick the very best of the best, and this includes women as well as men. Once we have recruited, tested, and trained top-shelf pilots, only then can we develop the other infrastructure required to keep England safe from aerial attack."
FEN_SLP_Military_praising_the_Aces_desc:0 "Albert Ball, "Bob" Braham, "Johnnie" Johnson – these are the names people remember, true knights of the air that defended the skies of England and France in the heydays of the Empire. We need to emulate their fighting spirit in our new air force, as well as use our new combat leaders as recruiting tools to motivate potential pilots to sign up for their own shot at glory. With luck, we can establish the same esprit du corps that made our pilots legendary throughout the world as doughty fighters."
FEN_SLP_Military_lessons_from_the_ECW_desc:0 "While we can create a fairly large army, it is likely that in future wars we will be somewhat outnumbered, as we were in the ECW.

Jerry may think himself a master of these tactics, but we will show him a thing or two about English doggedness and strength in adversity."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_tactical_bombers_desc:0 "The innovative design of the Mosquito fighter-bomber was born of desperation, but was shockingly fast and agile for its role. In today's jet age, we may be able to take the same concept of a high-speed light bomber and create a multi-role aircraft that is quick on the attack and agile in defense. This would be able to defend the homeland by striking at invading forces while still being a threat across the channel to any hostile power."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_fighters_desc:0 "The elegant Spitfire was the backbone of our interceptor air defences during the Blitz, and would go on to serve many roles in the War. The sleek lines, high speed, and excellent maneuverability made it perfect against escorting fighters in a close-up fight. We will need a new generation of interceptors if we are to prevent England from being destroyed from the air, and this means relying on the same principles of old. Our new fighter designs will have to be the best of the best to protect England from any airborne menace."
FEN_SLP_Military_new_CAS_desc:0 "The Typhoon fighter-bomber was not so elegant as the Spitfire, nor as nimble as the Mosquito- but it got the job done. The raw firepower and reliability it possessed in a neat little airframe was perfect for its role, and should not be underestimated. These same principles of getting the job done with simplicity and practicality should be emulated in our new generation of fighter-bombers, to ensure that any invader gets a handful when they hit the beaches."
FEN_SLP_Military_the_armed_union_debates_desc:0 "Unions are naturally a central part of our revolution, but arming them could radicalize the workers.

The more familiar the people are with arms now, the better they will be as real soldiers later."
FEN_SLP_Military_more_AA_desc:0 "Our radar and anti-aircraft systems helped greatly during the Blitz, and modern air defense networks can render friendly skies an extremely uncomfortable place for enemy aircraft. Distributed and protected missile batteries with radar stations and spotters can attrit an enemy air force and provide invaluable information to our pilots in the sky, who can be directed to attack what remains in the most optimal fashion.

FEN_SLP_Econ_the_road_to_reconstruction_desc:0 "With the Socialist Labour Party recently elected, it has fallen on Prime Minister Wilson to bear the burden of sorting out the economic situation England finds herself in. Wilson was elected on a platform of widespread government intervention in the economy and more generally getting England back into shape, what with her economy hamstrung by the economic crisis of the 50's and the recent Civil War both.\n\nThis reconstruction will be a long process, but thanks to the combined support of both our wings and a steady plan to implement our reforms we are closer than ever to reaching the socialist ideal. What came before was a broken world, and upon its ashes we shall build a better one. A just one. A fair one."
FEN_SLP_Econ_financing_our_reforms_desc:0 "Unfortunately, England is not a socialist paradise just yet. To reach the goals we have set out for ourselves the Wilson Government will need to gather the necessary funds, something that cannot be covered by OFN aid and our existing industrial infrastructure alone. We need money, and our government has two options on how to get it.\n\nThe first and probably easiest choice is for England to focus on the basics, raw resources and their exports which are valuable no matter when or to whom you sell them. This would probably sit well with our allies in Washington. The other option at our disposal is to turn England into the capitalist world's chief manufacturer of consumer goods. A risky option, it also gives us the chance to make England more than a pawn for the rest of the world. Yet, a choice must be made."
FEN_SLP_Econ_focus_on_consumer_goods_desc:0 "Part of the reality that England must now face is the fact that we can no longer survive off of our former colonies resources. The Socialist Labour Party has thus turned to more traditional methods of acquiring income. The Americans it seems have an ever increasing market for finished goods, but they don't produce a great amount of some devices themselves due to the expense in making them over the Atlantic outweighing the profits. We don't have that problem.\n\nThe necessary living wage for an English labourer is low even if we increase it threefold, and importing materials en masse is hardly a chore. Thus the Wilson government proposes a plan under which England shall aim to become invaluable to the OFN not just through strategic position, but as their primary source of consumer goods."
FEN_SLP_Econ_factories_in_the_cities_desc:0 "The majority of the current English factories aren't located within the major metropolitan areas, and whilst this might make the cities nice and livable it also limits the number of people willing to work away from their homes. But we are not capitalists limited by bourgeois concerns such as the view over our cities. Our people need jobs and we will give them just that.\n\nLondon, Manchester, Birmingham and Newcastle can be expanded into first, after that we can aim for York, Hull and Liverpool. Eventually every city in England will have its own independent industrial base, which is good because the amount of interest in cheap English goods is already rising."
FEN_SLP_Econ_more_fuel_to_the_fire_desc:0 "No furnace will run without coal, and fortunately England has a rather large amount of it. Not quite so much as neighbouring Wales, but we can make do with what we have at the present time.\n\nOur government will ensure a direct route from the mines to the furnaces, we don't have many close buyers of coal in any case since the Germans are not what one might call friendly. The jobs from this endeavour will keep many a family fed, and what kind of socialists would we be if we deserted one of our major supporting groups during the Civil War. We have many friends amongst the union veterans, and it's time we gave them their due."
FEN_SLP_Econ_workers_in_the_factories_desc:0 "Factories need the people to work them, and neither money nor threats will fix that as the fascist collaborators all too often forgot. We of the Socialist Labour Party have a different, and dare we say, better solution.\n\nWe'll simply pay the workers a wage worth his sweat. The marxist dislike of factories after all has traditionally stemmed from the fact that they exploit the workers efforts for more money than they contribute to the process in labour themselves. This will continue unfortunately as the capitalists will fight anything else, but the least we can do is give our workers a fair share of the profits. Throw in some excellent benefits and a factory position might not seem so bad a job for the youth of today."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_means_of_mass_production_desc:0 "Where once it was the job of the craftsman to create artisanal works, nowadays we use more refined and efficient methods to make the objects of men's desires. Machines, turning and grinding in vast clockwork formations which create England's salvation. Factories are more efficient than ever, and with rudimentary computing technology we can increase the efficiency to levels thought impossible once upon a time.\n\nThe benefits from this mass production will be used to increase the standard of living for all our people, for we'll not be limited just by what we make for others, we can make goods for ourselves as well."
FEN_SLP_Econ_export_to_the_OFN_desc:0 "America is like a furnace, into the maw of the great beast goes resources and materials the likes of which ten thousand England's could never hope to consume, and out of the fires comes enough money to fund our reforms six times over. The rest of the OFN are interested in our proposals as well, not having to deal with a problem is an instinctive capitalist response, and if we build things cheaper is that not merely the hand of the market in action?\n\nThe facts of the matter are that now we have committed to our course we cannot falter. If we want to turn England into a paradise our children will enjoy, we must make some compromises here and now. Empty pockets won't fund schools or hospitals, but the American money will."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_workshop_of_the_freeworld_desc:0 "If something is made, chances are it was made by an Englishmen and it's three times cheaper than what the American is trying to sell you. The recent years have been good for English business and now we make what the rest of the world is growing ever hungrier for. Be it toys, machines, or computers; we can design it, build it and improve upon it.\n\nThis has not been without sacrifice of course, it is backbreaking work and our people will need to be well compensated for any potential injuries incurred in the making of this economic miracle. But now that we have the needed funds, we can give them everything they earned and more. The Socialist Labour Party can move forward with our true reforms."
FEN_SLP_Econ_keeping_the_workers_fed_desc:0 "Hungry mouths make for precious little work, and unfortunately England has had to deal with the reality that we don't make quite enough to feed our current population. Importing food is expensive, and whilst we might never export it in great quantities again there is no reason why the Wilson Government cannot correct this fault, for the sake of the people, not for profit.\n\nFunds are as always an issue, but the Socialist Labour Party is broadly on board with two potential options. We can invest significantly in conventional agriculture, which might not be so profitable but it'd be a nice public relations boost and ingratiate us with the rural population. Or we could see about upgrading and expanding our fishing fleet, its not like the cod is ever going to run out after all."
FEN_SLP_Econ_fund_the_farms_desc:0 "The heart of the English spirit has long been the yeoman farmer, they who till the land and bring forth the spoils for the people to feast. But the industrial revolution led to the abolition of many commons and English agriculture has been on the decline since the reign of Queen Victoria.\n\nIf our government provides funds to expand the farms we have, we should be capable of producing enough food to keep the English people from being at risk of starving should a storm wrack the North Sea or the fisheries die. The grain, vegetables and meat from these farms can be put to other uses as well, school provided lunches perhaps could be a start."
FEN_SLP_Econ_subsidize_the_fisheries_desc:0 "Seafood was not traditionally a well integrated part of the English diet outside coastal towns and cities. Previous governments never really put in the efforts necessary to keep a truly massive fishing fleet running despite the potential benefits. This like many things changed with the German invasion.\n\nWith trade links severed England found herself lacking sufficient agriculture to produce food for all her people, and bereft of the trade lanes which had traditionally supplied preserved and canned goods. The Wilson government for its part does not aim to simply make do though. We will feed our people with the seas bounty, and increase our shipbuilding industry whilst we're at it. We just have to hope the people don't mind cod."
FEN_SLP_Econ_accelerate_mechanization_desc:0 "One of the downsides to being isolated from you empire as a whole and most of your major allies for near on three decades is the fact that you fall behind technologically somewhat. Doubly so when merely rebuilding what was bombed into smithereens is your primary problem.\n\nBut the Socialist Labour Party was not elected to sit around and let the market fix things, a programme to mechanise agriculture and fishing will go down well with the farmers who need every pence of their harvest, the Americans who we purchase the machinery from will doubtless also be pleased with their gains. This will be an expensive exercise to say the least, yet the long term gains from cheap food for our people should not be understated."
FEN_SLP_Econ_our_natural_wealth_desc:0 "England is a critically underutilised land, perhaps surprisingly so considering that for many decades we were the premier trade power of the planet. Gypsum, tungsten, tin, coal, iron, copper, limestone, salt, dolomite, clay and even sand are all things which England possesses in abundance and we exploit a surprisingly small amount of it.\n\nBut within these fancily named rocks and dirt lies the secret to the rejuvenation of the English economy. With some investment we can turn the English economy, at least temporarily into one revolving around the exportation of our raw resources. This will have an excellent profit margin and give us the funds we need to reform our nation into a more diverse, advanced and most importantly recovered economy."
FEN_SLP_Econ_expand_english_steel_desc:0 "The steel of English workers built the battleships which once set the whole world quaking to their knees. The steel of English workers forged wonders and terrors alike at the behest of their overlords in the upper classes. Now that very same steel is not in the hands of the bourgeoisie or the aristocracy, but in the workers hands. The peoples hands.\n\nThe Socialist Labour Party will need more steel than ever, but not to build wasteful exhibitions of our grandeur. No we shall build the things the people need. Houses and highways, hospitals and dams and railroads too and fro. We shall expand the steel mills threefold, we shall build the foundations of an industry which won't just sustain our people for now, but for centuries to come."
FEN_SLP_Econ_a_new_deal_for_coal_desc:0 "Black gold, that's what some of the more excitable capitalists once called the material which built the English Industrial Revolution. Coal miners made up a not inconsiderable part of our militias during the Civil War too, is it not right and just that we repay their aid in our day of need?\n\nLuckily for us, coal is still profitable for the capitalists. The OFN simply can't get enough of it. If we were to increase our production, perhaps even create some new mines to exploit untapped seams coal could well form the bedrock of our future economic plans. Unlike the capitalists of old however we will ensure that our people see the benefits from this, with reinvestments into the community and job opportunities given to diversify coal focused towns."
FEN_SLP_Econ_efficiency_through_socialism_desc:0 "The bosses of traditional mines and quarries were notoriously cruel men. Who got their quotas by forcing the workers to slave away in poor conditions with little safety for less pay. Perhaps this was somehow acceptable to the bourgeois who once ran this nation. Perhaps they thought if it was out of sight it was most assuredly out of mind. But we are the peoples representatives, their choice. We are different.\n\nBy giving the workers rights over their professions we return the control of labour to the people. By enforcing democracy we do away with the system of capitalism which crushed our forefathers under its wheels for centuries. Most of all, by removing the rich at the top of the chain, we unleash a peoples innovative spirit long suppressed."
FEN_SLP_Econ_imrpove_our_equipment_desc:0 "Unfortunately for our industrial ambitions we've run into a bit of a snag. Namely, our technology for producing and refining those resources is almost three decades out of date at this point. This is partly the result of our former bourgeoise overlords being notorious cheapskates, partially due to the fact that we were cut off from the Americans and the Germans never trusted the Royal Party as far as they could throw them, and mostly due to the fact that England was and still is a dirt poor nation.\n\nLuckily for us, the Americans are willing to foot the bill somewhat for replacing some of the more expensive and advanced pieces. They want our resources after all, no sense in getting them slowly."
FEN_SLP_Econ_enter_american_markets_desc:0 "America is locust, a great insect on the face of the world gnawing at the resources of a hundred different nations. Never satisfied and never full. Yet the great locust is ultimately a far better choice than the wasp of Germany lurking over the channel. Seeking to invade and parisitise us if they get even the smallest chance.\n\nWe will give the Americans the raw resources they so desire, we will give them all they want and more so that their money flows into our coffers to benefit our people. The workers of England will live a good life anew with the profits of their labours. The Americans in return will get the materials needed to fuel their ceaseless military-industrial complex. Both of us win really."
FEN_SLP_Econ_profits_from_trade_desc:0 "Trade has always been one of the more profitable endeavours for Englishmen, with records showing our island had links to the rest of the world from as early as the bronze age. But decades of bourgeoise neglect and skimming off the top have caused our earnings to plummet.\n\nYet with a new government new opportunities have been taken advantage of. The Americans, once ally turned foe turned ally again are more than happy to purchase vast quantities of ore and metals that our island is rich in. Soon with the money rolling in the Socialist Labour Party will be able to undertake the economic reforms we so desperately need to keep our nation whole. Our people have jobs, we have friends overseas, and all it cost was some dirt."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_five_giants_desc:0 "The Beveridge Report is a moderately sized document written during the course of the Second World War. Though buried by the Royal Party and their fascist colleagues in the aftermath of our defeat and the collapse of the British Empire, in the minds of the Labour members of the Left Resistance the report persevered.\n\nNow that the Socialist Labour Party is the one in power, we have a duty to uphold. We shall scourge from England the great evils of the world, our people will be free from disease, want for nothing, be enlightened, live in good housing and have every opportunity to benefit from their work. Everything before now has led up to this, we shall give the people the lives they always wished for and deserved. Regardless of what the reactionaries say."
FEN_SLP_Econ_want_desc:0 "England has had a limited social security for years now, but the Collaborationist government always declined to expand it to the people who needed it most, and so as always the Socialist Labour Party falls into the responsibility of fixing others' mistakes. Unemployment subsidies will give a great deal of aid to the more unfortunate members of our society, but we can additionally expand the social security system outright to cover a whole range of potential problems for the poorest members of our nation. Food stamps, grants of money to first time families, subsidies for community buildings and basic repairs. All things which our people cannot afford that we the government can give them. That we shall give them. Harold Wilson will not suffer England to be anything less than perfect in this."
FEN_SLP_Econ_equal_land_distribution_act_desc:0 "The two wings of our party have always squabbled somewhat, but there is something on which we are in full agreement. The bourgeoisie and the aristocracy own far too great a portion of the land area of England even now, and what did they do to earn this benefit? In the age of the industrial revolution it was the land owners who abolished the commons and seized all the property for themselves from small freeholding farmers.\n\nSo let us begin the Socialist Labour Party's most ambitious project yet. An act of parliament which will redistribute the agricultural land of england to the communities who work it. Miners and farmers and fishermen alike. Compensation will be given to the rich, but that is all."
FEN_SLP_Econ_disease_desc:0 "Our nation suffers, there is no great system of public hospitals or free treatments like some of the more enlightened places of the world, but that can be changed. National Insurance is a term used to refer to the programme wherein in return for an income tax the average person will have compensation for workplace related injuries or illnesses amongst other things. Greatly easing the burden of the ill and injured on their families.\n\nThe income tax won't be especially popular in some areas, yet it is the wealthy who shall shoulder most of the burden here and so it shouldn't impact our popularity by any great amount. Besides, they will receive the benefits of socialism too."
FEN_SLP_Econ_national_health_service_act_desc:0 "Healthcare has long been one of the main goals of the Socialist Labour Party, and now we are in a position where we can implement it. Why should the working man have to worry about needing to visit the doctors because they lack the money to pay? Why should women be forced to resort to midwives rather than hospital beds? Why must men and women pay for their children's vaccines, insulin and so on out of their own pockets?\n\nThey should not, and thanks to the National Health Service Act they will never have to again. This comprehensive piece of legislation will establish a nationwide healthcare system paid for by the state which will ensure no person ever need worry about necessary procedures, medicines and treatments for as long as our government is in power."
FEN_SLP_Econ_ignorance_desc:0 "Harold Wilson was an academic before circumstance forced him into the life of a revolutionary and leader, but remnants of the former economics lecturer remain in his policies still. The Socialist Labour Party is committed in its entirety to the ideal of a comprehensive and effective school system for the future students of England, to the end of promoting this the government will issue grants to a great number of school programmes and improvements.\n\nAdditionally, the great universities which shaped many of England's finest in past times will receive funding of their own to restore their glories. No longer will we look to the rest of the world for academic success, as in all things England shall forge her own."
FEN_SLP_Econ_equal_opprotunity_act_desc:0 "Schooling is not an easy burden for a family to bear. It is expensive, and when your child might not even get the proper use out of his schooling a seeming dead end for many families across England. Yet are we not the party of the people? Are we not socialists in the image of Marx, Atlee and Pollit? We should not let what has been convention define us in improving our nation. Indeed, Harold Wilson has crafted an act to ensure we need never worry about this problem again.\n\nThe Equal Opportunity Act will make all schooling and most higher education free for all Englishmen and women provided they get the results to enter. As we do this, we ought not think of the costs, but of the benefits to our nation and people from many young minds not being hindered by birth. This was a good act."
FEN_SLP_Econ_squalor_desc:0 "The bombs of Germany destroyed vast swathes of old English housing, swathes which have never been properly rebuilt if we are honest. London once home to a beautiful scenery now also shares its land with slums stretching as far as the eye can see. So too do many of our fellow cities and towns across England, and the civil war only made the situation even more dire.\n\nRegrettable though it may be, we must clear out these slums to build affordable housing for the English people, the first step of this will not be popular with anyone and most likely hated in London in particular, but it is necessary. Provided we stagger the clearances and buildings, we should even avoid a homelessness crisis."
FEN_SLP_Econ_peoples_housing_act_desc:0 "Now that the slums have been cleared, the Socialist Labour Party can begin our work on solving the matter of squalor for good. The People's Housing Act lays out the plan for the construction of a great series of government owned housing tenements and buildings across England for the purposes of affordable housing. Whilst not luxurious, they will be modern dwellings in which the English poor shall have opportunities to get themselves out of the cycle of poverty with our assistance.\n\nThe necessity of this act is great enough that both factions of our party agree in principle even. A sight few thought they would see without great prompting by the leadership."
FEN_SLP_Econ_idleness_desc:0 "For all that convservative reactionaries like to go on about how we socialists encourage people to be lazy with their lives and government support, they forget that the vast majority of people are quite willing to take any work offered when in a state of unemployment. Thus if we the government provide the steady and decently paying work, a large number of people will be suddenly in a position of becoming productive members of the economy once more.\n\nWe might have to nationalize a good many industries to achieve this, the companies are unlikely to cooperate of their own accord, but the results will most assuredly be worth it. Nationalization will additionally assist us in preventing the Americans from having a deathgrip on our economy, but that is mostly unrelated to our decision."
FEN_SLP_Econ_national_minimum_wage_act_desc:0 "Why is it that the average worker should have to subsist on a minimum wage barely updated since the days of the Royal Party? Are we not better than the fascists who betrayed England to the Germans? Harold Wilson certainly seems to think so, and he's tasked the Socialist Labour Party with drawing up new legislation on the subject of the minimum wage.\n\nWe'll have to raise it carefully and in a controlled manner of course, yet the benefits of the raise will still take some time to make themselves apparent. The long term effects of the National Minimum Wage Act will mean the average Englishman having more capital to contribute to the economy amongst other things, so even the reactionaries ought to be happy."
FEN_SLP_Econ_the_health_and_needs_divison_desc:0 "We have in recent times done a great deal of legislation and policy making which focuses towards societal matters. Healthcare, wages, housing, education and so on. It might better serve the people of England to bring changes to these things under the banner of one governmental organisation.\n\nThe Health and Needs Division, HAND, will be at the forefront of implementing future governmental aid and support programmes of our welfare state. HAND will also act to advise the government on the potential effects of new changes and current policies, assisting us in maintaining a high state of living for the average Englishman regardless of his personal wealth."
FEN_SLP_Econ_signs_of_recovery_desc:0 "It seems to have worked. The efforts of years, decades of revolutionary activities are beginning to show once and for all the potential of socialism under the English model. When one looks across England they will not see the poverty and rubble of times past but instead a land finally beginning to recover from the ravages of war.\n\nHealthcare and education are free, jobs are plentiful and the minimum wage high. This is the dream of our forefathers, and with some luck it is something we can maintain into the future for all our children. Even the National Democratic League are starting to come around, so surprising as it may be, this England looks set to last the ages in prosperity."
