wallace.impeachment.1.t:0 "Our Darkest Hour"
wallace.impeachment.1.desc:0 "Federal troops, deployed to Little Rock to enforce the Wallace administration's legislation on school segregation, opened fire this morning on protesters marching to Little Rock Central High School to protest the recent expulsion of all African-American students.  The shooting occurred as the protest column were blocked from approaching the school by counter-protesters in support of the decision, with federal troops attempting to separate the two groups.  Local hospitals report that fourteen African-American protesters were killed and another thirty-six were injured, with no reports of hospitalizations from the predominantly white counter-protesters. \n\nPentagon officials declined to comment on today's events, only stating that soldiers involved 'exercised appropriate restraint in response to an increasingly violent situation.'  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has condemned the actions of federal troops, claiming that the shootings were 'the latest display of barbarity by a government that, with a wink and a nudge, violently imposes unjust segregation in the name of justice and order.'\n\nWhile Little Rock has only reported sporadic violence after local authorities declared a curfew with immediate effect, the impact of the incident has spread rapidly as protests and looting have been reported in New York, Detroit, Boston, Birmingham, Chicago, and Baltimore, with protest leaders calling for an immediate investigation into the conduct and orders given to federal troops involved in the shooting.  Senior R-D leaders in Washington, and members of the NPP-C caucus, have issued a statement that they will demand an immediate explanation from the Pentagon and the White House in the coming days."
wallace.impeachment.1.a:0 "The coming days will be hard..."

wallace.impeachment.2.t:0 "Arkansas Demands Investigation"
wallace.impeachment.2.desc:0 ""...in response to protesters gathered daily outside the state capitol and with state police increasingly overwhelmed by controlling nighttime riots, the Governor of Arkansas has announced the state government will conduct its own investigation into the conduct of federal troops during the Little Rock shootings.  In his remarks, the governor openly questioned the Wallace administration's decision to deploy Federal troops in the state, blaming unclear orders and a lack of familiarity with local practice for the disastrous shootings..."\n\nWallace's aides shared concerned glances with each other as the President's face twisted into a scowl.  The Chief of Staff shut the TV off, forcing the President to return his attention to his immediate surroundings.\n\n"Mr. President, you know how bad this looks.  We have to get ahead of this problem by opening a federal investigation, before Congress and Arkansas start drawing... unwarranted conclusions."\n\nWallace nodded slowly; the optics of American soldiers shooting other Americans in the street were too horrendous to be ignored, and he knew that the vultures were circling low.  All that mattered now was damage control, and getting the Federal government to take charge of the investigation before the Arkansas state government could start collecting evidence, starting from Wallace's phone call to the Governor before this entire mess started..."
wallace.impeachment.2.a:0 "Lock it all down!"

wallace.impeachment.3.t:0 "The Bloodhounds"
wallace.impeachment.3.desc:0 "A day after the government announced that the Pentagon would be taking charge of investigating the conduct of troops in the Little Rock shooting, Wallace found himself waiting impatiently for his Chief of Staff to return from a meeting on Capitol Hill.  He was clearly being delayed by angry Congressional leaders, most likely being raked over the coals for Little Rock.  But so long as the NPP didn't break ranks, they'd be just fine, once the military and the Justice Department secured all the evidence in Arkansas -\n\nHis Chief of Staff rushed into the Oval Office, short of breath.  Clearly flustered, he could barely manage a stammer.  "Congress has the transcripts of your call with the Governor.  He sold us out before our people could secure the evidence." \n\nWallace reeled.  "And Congress?"\n\n"They're buying the governor's story, that he wasn't adequately consulted or informed about the federal troops' mission before the shootings." Wallace offered the Chief of Staff some water, but he refused, continuing on.  "The Center's going to agree to an inquiry in the House of Representatives.  The investigation's not in our hands anymore, and we're going to be called to give testimony at some point."\n\nWallace swore. The dogs in Congress had smelled blood, and that was going to make everything more complicated.  Perhaps it was time to take the argument directly to the people..."
wallace.impeachment.3.a:0 "The people need to hear our side of the story!"
wallace.impeachment.3.b:0 "Maybe we can set up a patsy..."
wallace.impeachment.3.c:0 "Congress won't find anything, calm down!"

wallace.impeachment.4.t:0 "Pulling at the Heartstrings"
wallace.impeachment.4.desc:0 "With only a day at most before President Wallace addresses the nation, the administration finds itself split on how best to approach the statement, likely to be the most politically consequential speech of President Wallace's political career. \n\nWith the nation continuing to convulse from daily protests and increasing violence, the safest avenue would be to issue a blanket statement for public unity as the investigation - both congressional and federal - continue.  Even if the people are still skeptical of Wallace's good faith, the statement might be enough to tie the NPP together, buying more time for the administration to craft its defense in Congress. \n\nOthers advocate a more confrontational approach, from claiming that the entire mess isn't Wallace's fault and pinning it on military discipline, to continuing to advocate for law and order and ignoring the administration's role in the crisis.  While elements of these approaches would allow us to directly challenge the facts of the case - or, in the case of the latter, try to get back to the business of actually governing America  - the response of our allies in the NPP, to say nothing of public opinion, will most likely be sharply negative.\n\nThere's only one shot to get this right."
wallace.impeachment.4.a:0 "The nation has to come together"
wallace.impeachment.4.b:0 "Promise an investigation into military discipline - and not the orders given"
wallace.impeachment.4.c:0 "Everyone settle down, right fucking now!"

wallace.impeachment.5.t:0 "Triangulation"
wallace.impeachment.5.desc:0 ""And that's your entire plan, Mr. President?  Just pretend that nothing happened?" The NPP senate whip asked, incredulous.\n\n"The country needs to sit down and get back to business, and we've all got bigger things to worry about than rioting over something we're already investigating." Wallace said.\n\n"...I wish you the best of luck, Mr. President."  The senator replied curtly, storming out of the room.\n\nWallace's Chief of Staff, increasingly haggard after days of managing the administration's response to the crisis, looked ready to snap.  "This isn't working, Mr. President.  We're not going to get the NPP to come along with us like this." \n\nWallace turned on his staffer.  "You have a better plan? We're not rewriting the damn statement in four hours!"\n\nThe Chief of Staff pleaded with the president.  "No, but we have some time to mix in a few more facts.  If we can hold on just a bit longer, maybe we'll find something that might support our assertion that the troops felt they were in danger, due to the violence from the protesters and the counter-protesters that day.  Just enough facts to make our case more convincing, and make it seem like both sides were at fault.""
wallace.impeachment.5.a:0 "We'll go with what we have!"
wallace.impeachment.5.b:0 "A few more hours is short if the people believe"

wallace.impeachment.6.t:0 "Terror, Travesty, and Television"
wallace.impeachment.6.desc:0 "The occasional flash of a camera, the whisper every minute or two, the awkward cough or clearing of one's throat, and the shuffling of paper's by the President to look over his speech. These were the only noises heard in the Oval Office in the morning following the terrible days which had been suffered by Americans across the country. Now, citizens, politicians, and even his own cabinet members are asking, no, demanding an answer from the President regarding the happenings at Little Rock. "Mr. President, we go live in 3, 2, 1..." \n\n"Good morning, my dear fellow Americans out there. The past day has been filled with emotions of terror, anger, and grief. Yesterday morning, as Little Rock Central High School opened its doors to begin the school day, a group of expelled African-American students began marching in a column towards the doors. As they marched, they were met with fierce resistance by counter-protesters looking to block the young adults from entering the school, prompting federal soldiers to attempt to de-escalate the situation. In the growing tension and rising violence, they were forced to make a terrible decision to maintain law and order, and opened fire into the group of students to disperse the combatants. The injured and dead were collected by the soldiers ordered to guard the area, in total amounting to fourteen dead African-American students and thirty-six injuries. Ladies and gentlemen, no matter who you are out there, this is a shameful tragedy that my administration is hard at work to investigate the nature and surroundings of the event. Any student being shot and killed is a terror that we wish to do away with in modern society for the United States, and it is unfortunate that as great as our country is, we must suffer as we do now. I ask you all to stay united, to stand strong in these times of crisis. Do not riot or protest; rather, stand with us, and we will do all we can for justice. For country, for family, for party, for freedom and justice for all." \n\nThe flashes of cameras continued to plague the President, but acting harshly would only drive this situation worse. "Let them take the pictures, let them be the first to know that George C. Wallace suffers with them." thought the President."
wallace.impeachment.6.a:0 "Let's see how that went."

wallace.impeachment.7.t:0 "Crafting the Defense"
wallace.impeachment.7.desc:0 "A Congressional impeachment inquiry, it turns out, is no simple fact-finding exercise.  Armed with the power of subpoena, lawmakers can compel witnesses or public officials to provide documents or sworn testimony on a wide range of subjects, with criminal penalties for anyone refusing - or worse, choosing to lie.  With that in mind, the House Oversight Committee had wasted no time in calling on a wide range of witnesses involved in the decisions leading up to the Little Rock Massacre, ranging from the soldiers on the ground to White House staffers privy to the most sensitive decisions by the administration. \n\nWallace flicked through the list of witnesses and attached rationale provided by the House investigators.  It was an expansive list, on an aggressive timetable.  Wallace grimly noted that his administration would only be enough time to fully coordinate and lock down the stories of one of the two groups of individuals summoned - the soldiers on the ground, or the staffers helping issue the orders. \n\nAnd then, of course, there was the matter of the NPP legislators on the House Oversight Committee, and how willing they'd be to softball the investigation.  With the Center-NPP on the verge of revolt, this too would be no easy task, but surely, leaning on members of your own party was more acceptable than coaching witnesses?"
wallace.impeachment.7.a:0 "Coordinate the soldiers' testimonies"
wallace.impeachment.7.b:0 "Lock down our staffers"
wallace.impeachment.7.c:0 "Make some courtesy calls to Capitol Hill"

wallace.impeachment.8.t:0 "Friction"
wallace.impeachment.8.desc:0 "The constant underlying the testimonies of the soldiers deployed in Little Rock is ambiguity and chaos. \n\nUnder an admittedly vague set of orders - 'to uphold the law and preserve order' - the soldiers described an atmosphere of confusion as they formed a thin cordon between the African-American demonstrators and white counter-protestors. \n\nA scuffle broke out, sending a wave of tension through the air, with the soldiers caught in the middle trying to separate the two groups.  A crack; had a weapon discharged?  An exchange of harried glances down the line, followed by another crack, then screams.  The crowd surged forth.  Rifles up.  No time to aim, except at center mass. \n\nIt all sounds like a terrible accident, and we could argue as such, that the confusion and ambiguity makes any presumption of impeachable intent ridiculous.  That being said, none of that changes the fact that all of the dead were from the African-American demonstrators, and in light of that there is no assurance ambiguity will be a believable defense.  Indeed, we would open ourselves to accusations that the ambiguous orders were by design, a mobster's suggestion to avoid accountability for upholding 'the law' of segregation.\n\nWe could get the soldiers to 'agree' that they were not explicitly authorized to use force, but did so anyway, on their own judgment.  It is a clear admission of blame that lets us off the hook, but preparing the 'incentives' for the soldiers to testify in this way would be expensive and unethical, to say nothing of how the military could be affected by being made into a political scapegoat."
wallace.impeachment.8.a:0 "An accident, caused by an infinity of petty circumstances..."
wallace.impeachment.8.b:0 "They exceeded their orders, damn it!"

wallace.impeachment.9.t:0 "Zero Recall"
wallace.impeachment.9.desc:0 "Very little in Washington is ever done in total secrecy.  Every meeting has its note-takers, who relay the outline of decisions taken to more junior functionaries, who then relay action items to further junior clerks, and so forth.  From the cradle to the grave, government policy is defined by a near-obsessive level of documentation, which security classifications can only do so much to keep away from prying eyes.\n\nWallace knew this, and he had no illusions that he'd be able to lock down the entire paper trail at this stage in the game - the House was far ahead of him in that regard, and clumsy efforts here would look worse than anything committed to paper.  But legalese and government records have their own way of obfuscating essential truths, which could really only be parsed by bystanders intimately familiar with the background of their creation.  They was the linchpin; the documents were carefully couched to survive judicial review, but if the staffers involved in the drafting were asked to be entirely truthful, the words undoubtedly took a different political meaning.\n\nThankfully, there was a constitutional remedy for the question at hand: the Fifth Amendment.  Nobody, not even in front of Congress, could be forced to make any statement that might be self-incriminating in the case of the Little Rock massacre, which could potentially be expanded as a de facto gag order.  Of course, pleading the Fifth hardly provides for the best optics... but trying to force everyone to toe a party line that there was no political intent might be even worse if somebody cracks, even if it would give the 'clearest' answer possible."
wallace.impeachment.9.a:0 "Plead the Fifth!"
wallace.impeachment.9.b:0 "Deny, deny, deny!"

wallace.impeachment.10.t:0 "All on the Same Side"
wallace.impeachment.10.desc:0 "Members of Congress were quick to play ball when times were good, Wallace had learned, but they all took painstaking effort to be busy or unreachable when the chips were down.  Finding each of the NPP members of the House Oversight Committee had taken hours, despite Congress being in session.\n\nAnd of course, there was the matter of what to say to get the NPP back in line with the President.  Despite being members of the same party, there was no obligation for the NPP members of Congress to stick their neck out for a President they didn't like, if they thought they had a secure enough base at home to survive any primary challenge that might result from bucking the national party.  Wallace was self-aware enough to know that he was quickly becoming radioactive with the Yankee-leaning, progressive segments of the NPP electorate; they would be the hard nuts to crack on the Oversight Committee, whereas the Right-NPP could plausibly be brought in line with bland promises of party unity and more control over the reins of policy.\n\nAnd for the recalcitrants?  Wallace was Wallace; he refused to be thrown to the curb and discarded like a piece of cardboard as just another party apparatchik.  He had a following, outspoken in the Deep South and quietly present elsewhere, that wouldn't stand for seeing their president be fed to the wolves.  With all eyes on Wallace and the potential for impeachment, he could... quietly encourage holdouts on the Committee to support him, or else face a challenge from their right flank.  How much would they really be willing to chip away at their own political fortunes for their principles?"
wallace.impeachment.10.a:0 "Keep it safe, we'll make do with the votes we have"
wallace.impeachment.10.b:0 "Time to lean on the Center!"

wallace.impeachment.11.t:0 "Vacuum"
wallace.impeachment.11.desc:0 "Politics, as with nature, abhors a vacuum.  In the absence of any statement from the White House concerning the Little Rock shootings or the developments in the House afterwards, the media is abuzz with half-checked truths, conspiracy theories, and rumors about the role our administration played in the chain of events.  The most popular story circulating through the news cycle alleges that even if we didn't order the troops to shoot in Little Rock, the general bent of our civil rights policies would suggest we aren't terribly bothered by the shootings that resulted - and that our silence confirms the narrative. \n\nHowever much the administration agrees with that statement is besides the point; someone else is writing the story, and the refusal of President Wallace to get involved with even proposing a counter-narrative is leaving the legislators in the NPP scrambling to put together a response, which is slipshod at best and incoherent at worst.  Naturally, the NPP congressional caucus is furious.\n\nThings would be bad enough if it was just the media baying for blood and the NPP demanding action, but the nation as a whole remains roiled with anger and recrimination.  Civil Rights marches are being organized on an almost daily basis, and curfews are increasingly in place across the South to tensions between the African-American and White communities from exploding.  All on our watch."
wallace.impeachment.11.a:0 "Fuck."

wallace.impeachment.12.t:0 "The Students Testify"
wallace.impeachment.12.desc:0 "Live from the steps of the capitol in Washington D.C., in the most recent investigations into the Little Rock Central High School, the House has decided to formally set up a trial to investigate President Wallace's actions during the ordeal, in an effort to root out any wrongdoing on the President's behalf, which could lead to a trial of impeachment for President Wallace. Reports indicate that the first set of witnesses have been called forward by the House of Representatives' trial: these witnesses being the African-American students involved in the protest to testify against the Wallace Administration. \n\nWithin the House Chamber, the Speaker of the House has officially begun appointing managers of the case to begin hearing evidence presented by the students present at the massacre at Little Rock. There, they make an already emotionally heartbreaking story abundantly clear for the American people. "We were finally making it to the high school's front doors," said Percy Jameson, one of the witnesses in the middle of the bloodshed, "when we were met by protesters who fought against the movement. They did not want us walking into that school, shouting things like 'get the blacks back out to the fields.' Eventually, the shouting escalated into fighting, as while we marched, several of my fellow students were punched, kicked, and hit over the head with signs, sometimes even bricks. And that's when," Percy takes a minute here, his voice cracking and choking before he says it, "that's when the troops came. They came and beat everyone back, some of them looked confused and scared like us, but some of them looked like they hated us. When the ones hurting us continued to push forward, they opened fire." Percy is calmed for several minutes after breaking down in tears. \n\nNews teams are spread wide and far as the situation within the capital continues to develop. More students turned protesters turned victims offer their side of the story, and with the continuously developing situation, only time will tell what will be the outcome for President Wallace after all of this."
wallace.impeachment.12.a:0 "Kid never said I did it!"
wallace.impeachment.13.t:0 "The Guardsmen Testify"
wallace.impeachment.13.desc:0 "The investigation into the mass shooting in Little Rock just a few days ago continues within the House today, as Representatives have decided to call forth their next set of witnesses to offer testimony: the National Guardsmen involved in the massacre at the high school. Reports indicate that this involves guardsmen who actively opened fire into the crowd as well as those who never partook in the shooting, as well as the senior officers involved in the response to the escalation of events that day. \n\nOfficials of the House Judiciary Committee began receiving testimony from several of the guardsmen to judge official involvement in the enforcement of the order to open fire into the crowd of protesters. "The second platoon of the 216th Military Police Company within the state of Arkansas had been ordered to enforce federal laws in regards to the segregation of education centers in both Arkansas and the southern United States," First Lieutenant Victor Thornton, the commanding officer of the unit stationed at Little Rock Central High School, stated, "the events that followed after were an applied attempt at controlling the situation which fell into disorder." Many Representatives were caught gasping and whispering following what sounded like the commanding officer's approval of the actions at Little Rock. Another member of the unit, Corporal Douglas N. McConnell delivered a notably different testimony, saying "I was standing between a few other guys in the unit. I was scared to death, same as the protesters out there. Punches were being thrown, people were gnashing their teeth, screaming, I swore a brick almost knocked my eye out." he says. "It was all getting too bad too fast, enlisted personnel and officers were yelling just the same, until eventually someone yelled 'Fire!' and it all went,' he said, tears welling in his eyes and voice cracking, "it all went to Hell. Everyone started firing. I was so scared that I couldn't even feel my finger against the trigger, and only found out after that I didn't even fire a round." The guardsmen says, tears rolling down his face. \n\nWashington is in a state of fear and panic at the moment. However, no matter what, the government has promised that those responsible will answer for their actions at Little Rock Central High School, and make sure every victim is compensated for their loss."
wallace.impeachment.13.a:0 "Still didn't hear my name in there!"
wallace.impeachment.14.t:0 "The Staff Testify"
wallace.impeachment.14.desc:0 "After the emotional hearings from those stuck in the middle of the bloodshed at Little Rock a few days ago, followed by the shocking and eye-opening testimony given by the members of the National Guard involved in the shooting itself, the House of Representatives has decided to call upon its third and final set of witnesses to offer testimony as to what happened that fateful day. Today, the staff of the Wallace administration and the staff of the state government of Arkansas will testify and provide any possible connections from the two governments into the involvement of the deaths of those 14 students. \n\nThe first staff member called up to the stand by the House Judiciary Committee is calling forward the Secretary of Public Safety from the government of Arkansas to offer insight into the Arkansas government's involvement. "The Department of Public Safety recognizes the failures which led to the shootings which occurred at Little Rock Central High School and feels extreme regret in our actions that day." the Secretary said. "The escalation from peaceful protest to outright massacre did not happen intentionally in any form within the state government of Arkansas, we simply could not prepare for something so fast and so horrible to occur within such a short timeframe." After several more members of the state government were heard, the House moved on to the big names in the ring: federal staff members of the Wallace administration. "The United States and the Wallace administration feel strongly in regards to the status of segregation of the education system, and the actions of the protesting students that day," one figure within the Wallace administration said, who's name has been asked to be removed for his protection, "but just because we disagree with allowing these students in does not mean that we authorize massacres to prevent their entrance." One Representative stated that they were "shocked", and said that they were left "feeling gross" about the staff member of the Wallace administration's statements, defending segregation during the aftermath of a "butchery which happened thanks to that stance." \n\nWith the house formally ending its call for witness testimony, the Representatives have officially begun the process of deciding whether to forward the collection of evidence towards the Senate as Articles of Impeachment for President Wallace."
wallace.impeachment.14.a:0 "Someone get me that little bastard's name!"
wallace.impeachment.15.t:0 "House decides to forward Articles of Impeachment"
wallace.impeachment.15.desc:0 "In a rousing day for the American political sphere, the House has officially decided their verdict in regards to the investigation and collected evidence in the happenings behind the Little Rock Central High Massacre, as many within the media have decided to dub the shooting. The Speaker of the House has decided to "formally overturn the investigation to the Senate to begin a trial of President George C. Wallace in regards to his involvement within the killing of fourteen African-American Students and the injuring of thirty-six more." \n\nThe word "impeachment" rings out in a familiar tune for the people of the United States at this point; nevertheless, everyone has grown to stand firm in their beliefs regarding the massacre. "Those damned students were told to back down, and guess what: they didn't." said a protester in support of Wallace, alongside several men and women adorned with shirts saying "Wallace Will Win!" "It's not right to blame the President for the shooting, those troops with an itchy trigger finger are the ones that killed them, and those students shouldn't have been there in the first place!" However, others have different opinions in regards to the trial of impeachment for the President, as many who supported the protesters have gathered in Washington to condemn the President. "What Wallace did was an absolute disgrace for the United States. Whether he fired the shots into the crowd or not, he could have avoided this if he just let those children in!" A man screams, waving around a banner with the words "Racists Remain Responsible!" "Overall, I think there's a huge part missing for everyone supporting Wallace after what happened at Little Rock: those were school-kids. Children. Looking to walk in and get taught science and mathematics and english for christ sakes'." \n\n As the Senate prepares to formally investigate President George C. Wallace and his administration for their possible action, or possible lack thereof, the nation continues to stand divided as it drowns in the blood of fifty victims."
wallace.impeachment.15.a:0 "Damned criminals in the House!"
wallace.impeachment.16.t:0 "Our Judicial Ammunition"
wallace.impeachment.16.desc:0 "The wait was long, arduous, even just the daily tasks of the President had become exhausting for President Wallace. However, no matter what level of exhaustion he was at, anger flowed through the veins of the President, coursing through him with every flash of a camera and every reporter screaming outside of his office "Did you authorize the shooting, President Wallace?" Surrounded by a team of the best attorneys within the United States, law professors at Harvard, those who have defended previous Presidents, some of them with shiny gold awards, all of them had assembled within the Oval Office to prepare a defense for the President of the United States dealing with possible removal of office after a massacre that stained the nation. \n\n"Gentlemen, as you all know, these are difficult times that we live in, and I firmly believe that I have done what I can to embolden this nation after decades of fear and mistrust. But now, as I'm sure you've all seen, the media has turned this whole thing into a circus, with me as the biggest punchline of the joke, and with the House already against me, I need your help from the old bastards in the Senate. What can we do?" The President said to begin the discussions. And those discussions not only began, but stretched on for hours. Everyone in the White House felt like they were subject to being torn apart by the horde of news journalists and protesters that had formed within the capital over the past few days. Whether it was rocks hitting the walls of Robert Byrd's office, or when Lurleen Wallace dropped the bowl of soup she had just been made from the fright of seeing a reporter pressed up against the window behind her. The White House was torn apart, in a state of fear and anxiety as the only noises that sounded were the telephones ringing, the lawyers discussing with the yelling President behind the closed door of the Oval Office, and the onslaught of angry citizens and relentless reporters harassing the surrounding area. \n\nFinally, the President and his team of attorneys emerged from the Oval Office, akin to a group of knights looking to wage battle against the castle next door, with pens and legalistic language as their swords and shields. Now, no scare tactic from the media could slow down the defendant and his partners in court."
wallace.impeachment.16.a:0 "If the Senate wants war, they'll get it."
wallace.impeachment.17.t:0 "Our Day in Court"
wallace.impeachment.17.desc:0 "The air inside the Senate Chamber today was heavy, tense, sometimes you could feel the anger present in the room; however, at least it wasn't stale. President Wallace looked around at his jury, the most powerful legislative body in the United States federal government, and all seemed to look back at the defendant. The senior, most experienced Supreme Court Justice had taken the head of the trial, and soon, proceedings were to begin. However, despite the ongoing situation Wallace knew one thing: if anything, do not be scared. Do not be a coward. Do not let anyone sway you to falling. If anything: be angry. \n\n "May the Senate of the United States of America rise for the Pledge of Allegiance." the Supreme Court Chief Justice spoke. Everyone rose to recite the Pledge, including President Wallace, laying his hand against his heart in pride for his nation, speaking loudly and confidently. "Please take your seats." the Judge ordered. "Today, the United States Senate will begin proceedings for H.Res.519, formally entitled the 'Impeaching President George Wallace.' In conjunction with the submittance of evidence provided by the House of Representatives, it is now the Senate's duty to proceed with the investigations of United States President George C. Wallace after the occurence of the 'Little Rock Central High Massacre' to investigate the possibility of mismanagement resulting in the deaths of fourteen students and the injury of thirty-six others." Wallace was growing more frustrated by the minute, having to watch the old man fumble around in wading through these proceedings. He was an innocent man, he knew it, and if these damned Senators couldn't see it then the United States is doomed. "The prosecution, in this case, the Representatives chosen to represent the federal investigation, shall proceed in stating their opening argument." \n\nThe opening argument of the prosecution was an absolute disaster, in the eyes of President Wallace at least. Accusations of "potential action wasted by attribution of the President's fervent segregationist belief" causing the goddamned massacre when he wasn't even in the same state for it. Or, better yet, "President Wallace's administration led a disastrous mishandling of the situation which resulted in the deaths of several innocents." "The defense, in this case, President Wallace and his legal team, shall make their opening statement.""
wallace.impeachment.17.a:0 "...and there is a stark difference between the National Guard and President Wallace."
wallace.impeachment.17.b:0 "...therefore, the blame lies within the actions and mismanagement of local powers."
wallace.impeachment.17.c:0 "...in conclusion, the protest group that formed at Little Rock was illegal, and thus received the full implication of the law."
wallace.impeachment.18.t:0 "On the High Ground"
wallace.impeachment.18.desc:0 "Dr. Sadowski, the doctor of law and graduate from Harvard University who was serving as the leading defense attorney, finally sat down after a long hammering into the Senate over the beginning of the trial. After the man took his seat, the Senate responded to his opening with a stern silence. Some more inexperienced politicians may have been intimidated, Hell, even scared by the imposing sense of dread that followed. But not George Wallace. No, President Wallace stood by a single thought that journeyed through his mind: "the roaches are scared." \n\nWallace took a good long while to enjoy his first victory in what he believed would be a complete landslide of a trial. To be quite honest, Wallace thought that if there was any time to enjoy this entire ordeal, it'd be now. Sadowski leveled the opening of the prosecution with nailing the reasoning behind his innocence, and attempting to influence a return to reason for the most powerful law-making body in the free world after a complete "trial by media" already seemed to have occurred. However, unlike Dr. Sadowski, Wallace had known a fact which he held dear to his heart: there wasn't any reasoning with the bloodsucking politicians in Washington, especially when riled up against the man who tore them and their anti-American antics down. Who's to say that some of those Senators up there are plotting to not listen for the entire trial up until the final vote, where the name "Wallace" will ring out to them and they'll vote guilty? No matter, with any luck, the Supreme Court Chief Justice up there is going to ensure this remains as fair as possible, and none of the circus acts that his opposition has thrown out so far will endanger his chances. \n\nWallace knew that this was just the first battle in an entire war. Nevertheless, if this battle was won, Wallace and Sadowski were going to make sure that none of the characters in here looking to tear him down would get the chance."

Now, the trial shall move forward to the cross-examination of the witnesses. As is standard in United States law, the prosecution shall begin to cross-examination first." "Great," thought Wallace, "now they're gonna get the blacks to go up there and cry about their friends." Dr. Sadowski worked to calm the President, whispering that "until they get a picture of you with a rifle pointed at those students, you had nothing to do with this." \n\nThe first one the prosecution called up was that National Guardsman, Douglas N. McConnell, the one who was too scared to do as ordered. Some representative from New York was in charge of questioning the man. "Corporal McMconnell, you expressed a great deal of emotional turmoil following the bloodshed at Little Rock Central High School. Who would you say you're most frustrated at after all of this?" the Senator asked. "Well, you see, sir, that's a lot, but uh, you could say that frustration within myself can be pointed towards some of the men that day, but more importantly the ones who fought the protestors who wouldn't let the National Guardsmen present do their job. And, well, I'm frustrated in myself for having to have been so confused in it all." McConell responded. "Got them." Sadowski whispered to Wallace, knowing that a Corporal was raised to respect authority, and would be scared speaking against the Commander-in-Chief, his highest superior. \n\n"The prosecution would now like to call forward Mr. Percy Jameson." boomed the New York Representative. "That media sensation, the black kid who survived all the shootings. Let's see where this goes." thought Wallace. "Mr. Jameson, would you point towards the policy of segregation held by the Wallace administration against African-Americans such as yourself and the rest of your friends who died that day as being a direct cause for this massacre?" asked the Senator. "I, uh, well, my friends and I, we, um, we felt very upset about the men who fired on us that day, especially the officers out there who ordered it." Jameson responded. "Thinking that a young kid like him would point blame at the President of the United States in a room full of a hundred of the most powerful law-makers in the land, big mistake for them.""

Sadowski and Wallace knew they may have gained some ground in the prosecution's cross-examinations; however, their case can't survive on the holes within the prosecution alone, men have been sent to their deaths for less. No, it's time to gather a solid plan surrounding the next period of the trial. \n\nSadowski had generated a plan he and the rest of the team called "brilliant" as they looked like they were about to start patting each other on the back. Sadowski was going to call upon the unnamed staff member within the administration to grill into the man, and try to psyche him out into revealing faulty memories regarding anything even possibly connecting the administration or the President to the ordering of opening fire in regards to the current laws of segregation in school areas. That way, it can show a general inconsistency of information provided by such witnesses, and limiting the potential for the prosecution. Next, he was going to, of course, call up First Lieutenant Victor Thornton to the stand. Thornton already seems up his own ass about his innocence about shooting a bunch of kids; so, if we use him, we can show that the "peaceful protests" among the African-American students there were a lot more bloody than the media claims it to be. Plus, if they're disgusted, no matter what, Thornton's statements will be in pride of his own actions, distancing us from his orders in all regards if things go the other way. \n\nWallace took a few moments to think about the plan, when an idea struck him. "Sadowski, we aren't going to use the kid, Jameson?" Wallace said. "Well, we weren't planning to, why?" he responded. "Cause if we poke holes in his claims, we succeed in showing that he and the media blew his credibility out of proportion, and show that my policy about segregating they're kind is right, showing they can't be trusted." Sadowski and the legal team had to take a minute to process Wallace's radical proposal for a defense, because it could actually make sense due to the segregation argument. But time was running out..."

Wallace forever. However, it would be unwise to treat the intermission as a mere break to catch their breath and make any last prayers. No, this intermission was to be one of the most dynamic points of the entire trial, according to Sadowski, and Wallace enjoyed the prospects of potential victory being in their grasp, no matter how desperate the situation may have been at the time. Thus, Sadowski and the rest of the team began their plotting and scheming for the President, while Wallace himself enjoyed the quietness. "Finally, those old assholes won't be on their guard. Oh, how they'll realize their mistake in an early conviction of the one and only George C. Wallace. Oh, how they'll realize he didn't want those kids dead. Oh, how the taste of progress will be sweet once he claws his way out of here. \n\nOn the other end of the table, the team of attorneys were worried.

Having said that, the darker side of such supposedly "valiant" leaders of the country were beginning to show everywhere. Shadows lie everywhere when the light of the innocent is snuffed from the world. \n\n One of the attorneys on the team defending Wallace beckoned him closer to him, protecting against the inquisitive ears in the room. Finally, Wallace had gotten close enough to hear what the man was so worried about telling him, and the news he heard back was well worth the effort: some of the senators aligned with the Far Right of the National Progressive Party had been discussing voting in favor of the impeachment and removal of Wallace from office. Wallace nearly fell out of his chair, crushed over the news. The treason, the betrayal, had these senators no honor left at all? "Fucking vultures, why wouldn't they help me, they've supported me in everything that's happened so far?" Wallace whispered loudly, the lawyer seeing tears well up in the President's eyes. "Sir, the best estimate I can offer you is that if the vote happens to condemn you anyway, they do not want to be lumped in with those that wished to support you, sir." The President had to contain himself from smashing the top of the table with his fist. "This wasn't right. They were allies, Hell, some of them were fucking friends, people you'd shake hands with and talk about the big game with." Wallace thought. "Fine, fucking fine. Bastards want to kick a dog while it's down. Okay, what are our options from here?" Wallace asked. "Well, we could attempt to organize a small meeting in order to win back based on virtue, and sway them from their current mindset. Or..." the attorney said. "Or fucking what?"

Together, they saw that same unfortunate truth, and in that truth, the potential need for redirection. However, where one ally may fall, more arise. The R-Ds may be harboring promises of "stability" and "steady progress for a truly united America," however, what about the underbelly of such claims? What about those strong conservatives among the Democrats, the ones who promised their constituents a free and liberty-filled life during their time being one of the two greatest representatives of their state to the Union? What if such sympathetic characters managed to be swayed under the pleas of a bullied and harassed southerner who has fought gallantly in protecting the freedoms for the people of the United States? The media has already destroyed any sense of peace in the realm of private life, why allow the political partisanship to tear apart and genuine and honest man looking to provide a better life for the true patriots out there who hold such traditions dear? The plan was organized, these Democrats would hear the cries of the President and surely come running towards his support, right? \n\n"You know, there's a catch." Sadowski said. "Your grounded base of support is out there in the Senate, watching the proceedings and your defense. If they catch you trying to win over R-Ds, even if they were Democrats who were close to the FR-NPP anyway, they aren't going to be happy." "A gamble.

"All this work within the office of President, all this effort, all the good I've done, and now they want to stab me in the back. The animals, the disgust of it all!" President Wallace thought to himself. He felt his chest tighten, maybe it was the stress at it all, affecting his heart at this point. While it was getting difficult to breathe, the President stood resolute, even as the vein pushed out along his neck. "I did everything I could for the people of America, but know, they want to paint me as some monster at the end of the day." The counting of votes and occasional "Yea" and "Nay" interrupted the President's train of thought, causing him to tighten his grip on the table he sat at, now showcasing white knuckles to the entirety of the Senate. With every vote, the anxiety, fear, and anger grew within Wallace tenfold. "How could they do this?" He thought. "Do they realize the embarrassment of a second President removed from office in a row? Plus, what about LeMay? He's the one they really think is going to succeed and bring some imaginary greatness to America? The man can't run politics correctly, good luck getting him to shit rainbows and a successful economy for the American people." \n\nWallace waited. His legal team waited. His whole cabinet waited.

Presidential, administrative, and legislative policy bore no weight upon my decision that day, sir, I was merely acting in accordance with orders presented to me by superior officers within the Arkansas National Guard, sir." the officer responded. Thus ended the examination of the witness presented by the defense, in what seemed like a clearly victorious piece of judicial examination. \n\nBut, something wasn't right. Wallace continued to feel the anxiety crawl up his spine, that aching feeling that something was stabbing into him, compared to what appeared to be a clear victory in the eyes of court. That's when he noticed the eyes: that's it. The hundred eyes peering down at the defense in the Senate Chamber did not bode well in the thoughts of the President. But what could it be? Wallace continued to run through the events of the days past to figure out what may not be sitting right. As Sadowski reapproached the desk, Wallace suddenly had a dreadful realization as to the possible answer. In the silence of the senate, he pulled Dr. Sadowski over, noticing his similar look of dissatisfaction and worry with the reactions of the "jurors" around them. The two debated theories and postulations, until Wallace came down to the depths of his thoughts: "What about the staff, Doc?" "What are you talking about, what happened with the staff?" Dr. Sadowski act. "Well, think about it: the staff member went above and beyond to show that our administration had nothing to do with the damn shooting, and now, this asshat's clearing us of everything, like everything's fine and dandy.

Unfortunately, it is with a heavy heart that I have to say that myself and my entire organization felt the same degree of shock and horror, rather than the prompt notification before anything ever started in Little Rock. Arkansas is a strong state, known for its good people, but unfortunately, it appears that a horrific act of bloodshed has occurred on the streets of an otherwise peaceful town. My administration is committing everything it can to find who was behind the order to open fire into the protestors, as each and every member of the White House administration can guarantee not only our uninvolvement, but our further condemnation of the actions taken by the National Guardsmen present at the high school that day. We swear to the American public that we will find the one's responsible for perpetuating the deaths of these students, who unfortunately came into conflict with not only the counter-protestors on the streets of Little Rock, but also the unwise actions of someone to take their lives that day.

Yesterday, the people of America were awoken to a news headline soaked in blood. A news headline displaying the images of schoolchildren, dead on the steps of a large school called Little Rock Central High School. With these school-children disobeying the law and being met with fierce resistance from civilians acting as a counter-force to the children, the National Guardsmen were forced to make a difficult decision in a difficult situation. However, much to our despair, such a decision would not have had to be made if the outdated systems of the federal government and the extensive bureaucracy of the armed forces had made haste. Rather, having to pass the message along to the next person in a long chain of officials down into the military, the order was unfortunately held up by unnecessary traffic in communication centers across the country. Thus, in what should have been an easy call to make, the bloat of our government led to the killing of fourteen children, and the injury of thirty-six more. This is a disgrace of our government, of restraining the executive branch from executing just orders to stop the bloodshed from those willing to slay these children like animals. It is not right, and I, alongside the talented members of my administration, will do all we can to make sure nothing like this ever happens again, and will find out just who allowed such a bloodbath to happen in the first place. God bless the United States of America, and God bless you all." \n\nFinally, the camera clicked having finally ended the live broadcast. President Wallace asked, "Is it done?" The leader of the news crew responded with "Absolutely, thank you, sir." Wallace followed the thanks with a simple "Good, now get out, now." prompting White House Security to move the crew out of the building immediately."

In the White House, several men worked to help gather the President's belongings and personal effects to be brought out of the White House. Inside, Wallace shook the hands of his closest cabinet members, but could hardly bring himself to face the rest who looked up to him as a leader. As the man set on changing the face of America. The President George C. Wallace, leader of the FR-NPP and the strongman of modern American politics, forced out of office by law. In one of his final acts inside of the White House, Wallace shook hands with soon-to-be President Curtis LeMay, his former running mate and Vice President, before leaving alongside his wife, Lurleen Wallace, destined to arrive back home in Alabama. \n\nGeorge and Lurleen lied down in bed in Montgomery, Alabama, watching the swearing in of President LeMay. "I swear, within my duties as President of the United States, I swear to rectify the mistakes of the Wallace administration and settle the great rifts of our nation. I can only hope and pray to remain a man in better standing than Former President George Wallace." Wallace responded by turning off the television and rolling over to go to sleep."

wallace.impeachment.35.desc:0 "The Supreme Court Chief Justice was the first to speak, stating, "The Prosecution and the Defense have each laid their initial foundational arguments. Now, the trial shall move forward to the cross-examination of the witnesses. As is standard in United States law, the prosecution shall begin to cross-examination first." "Great," thought Wallace, "now they're gonna get the blacks to go up there and cry about their friends." Dr. Sadowski worked to calm the President, whispering that "until they get a picture of you with a rifle pointed at those students, you had nothing to do with this." \n\nThe first one the prosecution called up to the stand was Corporal Douglas N. McConnell, the one who was too scared to shoot. Some representative from New York was in charge of questioning the man. "Corporal McMconnell, you expressed a great deal of emotional turmoil following the bloodshed at Little Rock Central High School. Who would you say you're most frustrated at after all of this?" the Senator asked. "Well, sir, it is without a doubt the handling of the entire situation that has me the most perturbed, sir. It just seems like President Wallace almost allowed those poor kids to be shot out there, I'm not sure if it's that extreme, but I can't help but wonder." McConnel responded. "Shit." Sadowski whispered to Wallace, worried over the Corporal's continuous tearing at the President. \n\n"The prosecution would now like to call forward Mr. Percy Jameson." boomed the New York Representative. "That media sensation, the black kid who survived all the shootings. Let's see where this goes." thought Wallace. "Mr. Jameson, would you point towards the policy of segregation held by the Wallace administration against African-Americans such as yourself and the rest of your friends who died that day as being a direct cause for this massacre?" asked the Senator. "Segregation has proven time and again to incite anger and violence across the United States, sir. Not only in the past, but even now, as the blood of my friends stane the steps of my former high school" Jameson responded. "How the fuck did they get one this educated to represent them in the country's capital?" Wallace whispered angrily."

wallace.impeachment.36.desc:0 ""Finally." Wallace thought as Dr. Sadowski made the move to bring up the commanding officer of the National Guard platoon stationed at Little Rock Central High, First Lieutenant Victor Thorton. Thankfully, the prosecution had no suspicions regarding the witness; however, Wallace and his legal team had done great work in ensuring that, as quoted by some fancy scrawls left for the man to find on his door, "if his two kids ever wanted to hear about their father Victor again, then he'd best make it look like Little Rock was planned." \n\n"The defense would like to call First Lieutenant Victor Thornton of the second platoon in the 216th Military Police Company." Dr. Sadowski started. The Guardsmen moved down the Senate Chamber, looking nervous, frazzled, as if he hadn't gotten rest for the past few nights. "Perfect." thought Wallace. After initial greetings, Dr. Sadowski asked, "First Lieutenant, do you have any statements in regards to the buildup to the massacre, such as any motives from any parties involved?" The First Lieutenant nearly froze, before coughing and saying, "The, the shooting at Little Rock Central High School was, was a planned and intentional attack against the gathering students by the high command of the Arkansas National Guard." The Senate Chamber seemed to freeze perfectly still for a mere moment before exploding into chaos and disorder. The Senate was appalled by the First Lieutenant's account claiming the massacre was a conspiracy to slaughter students, and the Chief Justice called for order to return to the Senate Floor. "All according to pla-" thought Wallace, before being interrupted by a Representative strongly crying out "Objection!" Wallace's world froze, but he wasn't finished yet. "Your honor, this man's claims are a direct contradiction of official statements offered in regard to the investigation of the massacre; furthermore, the witness's physical, mental, and emotional faculties appear to have degenerated over the course of the trial, signaling the possibility of witness tampering. Permission to clear witness of duties, sir?" Wallace saw the grave stare of the Chief Justice as his world seemed to fall apart at the worlds of some Representative. "Objection sustained." The Chief Justice said, with the slamming of a gavel. \n\nEven seated at the table, Wallace felt the burning eyes and venomous whispers shared among the Senators, each adding fuel to the fire which burned Wallace inside out. The plan to use Thornton had been a failure, and now, Wallace and Sadowski needed to improvise."

Dr. Sadowski started. The Guardsmen moved down the Senate Chamber, looking exhausted, yet was ready to give testimony. "Right where we want him." thought Wallace. After initial greetings, Dr. Sadowski asked, "First Lieutenant, do you have any statements in regards to the buildup to the massacre, such as any motives from any parties involved?" The First Lieutenant looked as if time had become frozen, before stating, "The massacre at Little Rock Central High School was the result of direct miscommunication with superiors on my part. The administration tried to reach us." The Senate Chamber seemed to freeze perfectly still for a mere moment before causing Senators to openly whisper and debate between one another. The Senate was taken aback by the First Lieutenant's account claims of misinterpretation, and the Chief Justice called for order to return to the Senate Floor. "Thank god for tha-" whispered Wallace, before being interrupted by a Representative strongly crying out "Objection!" Wallace remained calm, but knew this could get out of control. "Your honor, this man's claims are baseless within respect to the investigation conducted of the massacre; furthermore, the witness's emotional faculties appear to display a form of paranoia, signaling the possibility of witness tampering and faulty testimony. Permission to clear witness of duties, sir?" Wallace thought and prayed that the Chief Justice would remain calm in the face of the lady calling for Thornton's removal. "Objection sustained." The Chief Justice said, with the slamming of a gavel. \n\nFrom his seat at the table, Wallace felt the intense suspicion rise to the air of the room, as poisonous whispers circulated the room, each comment sapping Wallace of strength as the trial went on. Thornton's intimidation had been a failure, and now, Wallace and Sadowski needed to improvise."

wallace.433.desc:0 "It is just as we feared. As the Senate sat down to begin the final debates and vote on the PFTA, one R-D senator skipped up to the stand with a determined twinkle in his eye. He began to speak - and continued to speak - and would not stop speaking for a very, very long time.\n\n"My fellow senators. This is a very important day for our country, no doubt. But before we hold this critical vote, I believe we need to discuss what really matters. I come before you today to speak about a subject very dear to my heart..."\n\nIt became immediately clear that this was indeed a filibuster. Rather than focus on the matter at hand, the senator began a lengthy reading of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, his favorite book from his youth. Despite the ridiculousness of the situation, filibuster is of course a protected practice. His voice was clear and driven, and at no point did he falter, leave for the bathroom or do anything that could bring the filibuster to an end. Even worse, lain out in front of him was a myriad of other reading material - it was clear that he was in this for the long haul.\n\nAside from giving in to the filibuster, we have two main courses of action. We could attempt to call a cloture vote - a vote to end the filibuster and immediately ratify the agreement. However, this requires us to secure a two-thirds majority. As time goes on, more and more people will be eager to see this filibuster come to a close, so an alternative is to wait it out until we can be sure we have enough support for a cloture vote to pass."

While this is not the final victory and the actual vote still needs to be secured, that the Senate agreed to the fastrack may serve as a positive indicator to the chances for the bill itself."
bill_2_failed:0 "Bitter groans emerged from Wallace's allies on the Congress floor today, as the proposal to fastrack the Perth Free Trade Agreement fell short of a majority. While this does not spell the end for the bill, it means that it will now continue to be debated by Congress, with the potential for a long lasting argument or the addition of amendments that may modify or dilute its intended purpose.\n\nPresident Wallace is reportedly furious at the news, knowing that many of his rivals in Congress would love nothing more than to see one of his crowning achievements strangled in the cot. Indeed, there are a few of these antagonistic individuals who will likely stop at nothing to prevent the bill's passing, utilizing everything in the rulebook including that time-old American tradition - the fillibuster."

How do we possibly move on from this? How can this possibly be anything other than a colossal failure for my presidency?"\n\nThe Perth Free Trade Agreement was delivered its sentence today, as the Senate finally dismissed the proposal. With the Bloc dead in the water, the delegations of the other nations have already begun leaving Perth to return home, quietly cursing the wasted effort. President Wallace has not been seen in public since the defeat, as he seethes over the tarnishing of his economic magnum opus.\n\nMuch of the opposition to the bill came from within the NPP, with much of the Center and even some of the more protectionist Right coming out to cast their votes against it. In the eyes of the voters, the failure of the NPP to come together to pass a measure that was already widely unpopular amongst a large amount of the general public has only further exposed the fractures in the party. The optics of this defeat for the NPP are certainly grave indeed.""
bill_5_passed:0 "At long last, after many weeks of negotiations, backroom deals and bitter arguments, the Senate today formally approved the Perth Free Trade Agreement, which was promptly signed into law by President Wallace. In Perth itself, the delegations present were finally able to ratify the Perth Bloc into an official institution of free trade across the Pacific and beyond.\n\nIt will take some time for the effects of the free trade zone to be felt. Major international corporations are currently in feverish talks with foreign governments and businesses to organize deals and expansion into overseas markets. There are already some promising signs, however, with the Dollar surging on the stock exchange as the markets respond positively to this historic development. The opportunities now open to American business are vast, and many business executives are currently occupying themselves with champagne and celebrations.\n\nAmerica is sure to gain much influence over the Pacific from the agreement, which will surely help beat back the grip of the Rising Sun. Though many of our voters are still leery over the impact of the PFTA, they will surely see the benefits soon. This is a great day for American business, and for the National Progressive Party."

Consequently, economic progressivism has seen a massive resurgence in the C-NPP and other groups, and they have become so vocal about their rhetoric that they are now impossible to ignore.\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith is famously pro-employer, but should she wish to pass some of her legislation, she must gain the support of the C-NPP. As outright pushing for pro-employee policies is out of the question, the President believes that better relations between businesses and laborers is the most effective and prudent solution to the problem. With the empowerment of the National Labor Relations Board, the employer-employee system may see improvement."

In almost 200 years of existence, the economy has been seldom worse. More than 20% of Americans live in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau; the nation's GDP has seen stagnant growth since the end of the Second World War, far less than would be expected; hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans lack access to basic necessities, such as clean drinking water. All-in-all, the United States of America is in bad shape.\n\nLuckily for the States, however, it has a president and congress who mostly recognize the issue, and are willing to do anything to put an end to it. While President Margaret Chase Smith wants most Americans to have access to welfare programs that would allow the poor and infirm to get back on their feet, she also knows that the federal budget could not allow for massive expansion of welfare. As such, the President and her allies in Congress will attempt to push through a new federal budget to cut back on wasteful projects and allocate the excess funding to a new welfare program; one that would primarily assist those who cannot assist themselves."

Yet, for decades, women have been refused leave from work to care for their child following birth. For such a crucial time in infantile development, precious little attention is given to it by the law. While it is true that some employers will allow new mothers to take perhaps a few unpaid days or weeks off work to care for their child, many do not. Consequently, many new moms are either forced to leave their children at home with a babysitter while they work- an increasingly expensive proposition- or take their infants to work with them, where they put immense stress on their mothers.\n\nAs most politicians are male, relatively few are more aware of this problem than President Margaret Chase Smith. She knows better than most that women not only deserve maternity leave, but require it. Raising a new generation is neither easy nor cheap, and thus, the President will press state legislatures to pass laws that mandate maternity leave, preferably of the paid variety."

This state of affairs cannot continue, for the sake of all those Americans forced to work long hours in poor conditions for the bare-minimum in wages, and President Smith acknowledges such.\n\nUnder the President's new economic reforms, the ability to unionize will no longer be a privilege for American workers, but an inextricable right. Previously, unionization was only protected at the state-level, with virtually no federal regulation in the matter. In her new legislation, the National Labor Relations Board would be given the authority to protect American workers' unions across state lines, greatly increasing the strength of the employees against their potentially unfair employers."

At the time being, the best we can do is grant economic security to the most low-income of people in American society; the blind, disabled, and those who have to provide for others, like single mothers.\n\nIn her most recent bill in a long but unfinished list, President Smith and her Congressional allies have worked together to create the American Economic Security Act, which will guarantee financial aid for those who either cannot work or cannot support their families, namely the disabled and low-income families. It will not be a great stipend, and likely won't have a great effect on rates of homelessness and poverty, but it will be a start."

For a group of people far more likely to suffer health problems, this news is plainly unacceptable. In order to rectify the issue, the President and her allies in Congress have drafted a new bill to create a new federal program to assist the elderly: Americare.\n\nIn this new healthcare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years of age, or those suffering from serious, lifelong conditions, would become subject to government-provided health insurance. Americare would not discriminate along racial or monetary grounds either, with full coverage regardless of race, gender, income, or other factors.

As young, unschooled children are at a very important developmental stage of their lives, having poor familial connection is devastating. To ensure the health of our working mothers, as well as the future generation of Americans they are raising, President Margaret Chase Smith has proposed greatly lessening the financial strain that children place upon their parents. This would be achieved through extreme cuts to taxes upon single mothers who work full-time, increased social security with less extreme benefits given to low-income families in which both parents are employed."

While many government laws over the past hundred years have tried to increase safety in the American workplace, these have been few and far between.\n\nHowever, due to extensive, somewhat-bipartisan campaigning and President Smith's cooperation with the C-NPP, this standard may be ready to change. The President and her allies in Congress have penned the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, for short. It would provide for the establishment of a new federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which will cooperate with workers unions and health experts to determine which workplace practices are safe, and which are not. In order to ensure business compliance, OSHA guidelines are not just advisory, but mandatory, with violators severely fined.

In the former, preferred by the President and most conservatives in Congress, the United States government would heavily subsidize insurance companies across America to keep medical expenses for the individual relatively low. This option is not without its downsides, however; these insurance companies are still businesses, and thus are primarily for-profit, so there will still be a not-insignificant price-tag.\n\nIn a state-provided system, supported mainly by the C-NPP and progressive elements of Congress, the government itself would be the primary care provider, with tax income serving as the payment method. This system would almost completely eliminate the cost of medical care for the patient. However, it would also cost significantly more, and lead to a massive increase in federal spending.

As they had no intention of choosing a lifelong career or profession, not many attended college.\n\nNow, this status quo is being challenged as more and more women begin to seek higher education and white-collar jobs. This "Quiet Revolution"- so called because of how the change has gone relatively unnoticed by society at large- represents a fundamental change in how women view themselves and their place in the world.

That's especially applicable to the NPP, a party founded in response to the threat of the Empire of Japan. If we really want to keep the party united, we should remind them of the greatest threat of all.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine dictates we protect our interests in the Western Hemisphere. The Smith Doctrine dictates a tough stance on the Sphere, to prevent a repeat of our failure in the Pacific War. The Charter of the Organization of Free Nations dictates we must protect democracy wherever it exists. The weakness of the NPP dictates we must take advantage of all of these precedents. It is, to put it bluntly, warmongering for political gain. But if we want to preserve the party, we have no other choice."

Japanese ownership of the Solomon Islands limits our ability to defend Australian airspace, the puppet regime in Singapore makes it impossible to control Southeast Asia's trade routes, and the Imperial Japanese Navy is more than a match for us at sea.

Unscrupulous bureaucrats and company men leech off the economic base of China for personal gain. And the high command of the Empire plots, waiting for the time to strike against the free world and take the Pacific once and for all.\n\nAt least, that's what Harlow and Safire recommend we tell the American people. If we're proceeding with an anti-Japanese message to unite the party, we need to further radicalize the base against them. Changing the perception of Japan should be our top priority- inserting a line in a speech here, modifying an internal memo there, and we'll have the party unified behind us in no time."

Since the publishing of his book Imperium in 1948, where he praised Adolf Hitler as the "hero of the twentieth century," Yockey has been a major figure of the radical right- farther than the Far Right of the NPP. His followers include segregationists so vile that even George Wallace might have second thoughts, militiamen preparing for a Japanese invasion, and even self-proclaimed American Nazis.\n\nThis does not mean that Yockey cannot be useful. The undue influence the Empire of Japan holds over the United States is a favorite subject of both the president and Mr. Yockey these days, and while his rhetoric is more... unrestrained, if convinced to follow the president's current expectations, he could be quite useful."

# Chase Smith Events
chase.open.1.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
chase.open.1.desc:0 "At the crack of dawn following the Inauguration, President Smith was already pouring herself a second cup of coffee while grimacing at the magnitude of the work ahead. \n\n Though the press raved about how Smith, the 'Grand Dame' of the NPP, had transformed the bickering party into a united front against the R-Ds, few knew how fragile the party was.  The party had nearly consumed itself after 1964, with the progressive and labor-friendly Center group, now led by the avowed socialist Michael Harrington, clashing incessantly with George Wallace's Far Right bloc, espousing 'states' rights' and free business.  The two only begrudgingly agreed on actively resisting Japan, which the R-Ds paid plenty of lip service to anyway.\n\nAs party divisions escalated openly going into the midterms, Smith - whose tenure in Washington, orthodox economics, and Maine liberalism could open doors across the party - had sat the two factions down.  She'd flatly warned that their squabbles were hemorrhaging support for the NPP, unless they put their differences aside behind a novel candidate - Smith herself.  Wallace and Harrington had grudgingly agreed, if only because the alternative was the political wilderness.\n\nBut now that Smith had won the White House, in defiance of political gravity in the NPP, reality would soon come crashing back down.  And although Smith has her own ambitions - in labor, healthcare, women's rights, and the fight against Japan - none of them would matter if the NPP went up in smoke."

chase.open.2.desc:0 "President Smith had been quick to assemble a 'kitchen cabinet' of trusted friends from the Senate to work on the task of binding the NPP together - before they inevitably started sniping at each other on the debate floor.  As the last of the circle of five filed into the Oval Office on a sleepy Saturday morning, smiling over their new access to the center of American political power, President Smith decided to impress upon them the gravity of the challenge they faced. \n\n "Gentlemen, do any of you recall the tragedy of the antebellum Whig Party?" Smith opened, noticeably tapping a stack of history books she'd conveniently placed on the desk.  The expressions of everyone else in the room tightened instantly.  Smith smiled; of course everybody knew the story of how one of the major political parties of the pre-Civil War era had imploded, fracturing under the weight of its own contradictions concerning the great question of its day - slavery. \n\n "I'm not saying that the NPP is going the way of the Whigs, but with Wallace on our right and Harrigton to the left, we're not too far from that scenario either."  Smith paused, letting the room absorb the magnitude of the task at hand.  "The papers are saying that having a woman in the Oval Office is history in its own right.  But any President is judged by the legacy they leave behind, and I refuse to have this administration be a footnote to the divisions in our own party!" "

chase.open.10.desc:0 "'Though we had our reservations about the election of a Maine woman to the highest office in the republic, we had elected to reserve judgment for the woman who could seemingly bridge the divisions between the two wings of the National Progressive Party.  We had hoped, that in the process of bargaining a historic compromise between the socialist left and the traditionalist right, that President Smith could deliver a fair and respectful deal for our readers and America.'\n\n'But our hopes appear unanswered by the President's own words yesterday in Congress.  Flanked only by the deputies of the NPP's center and leftist caucus, the President had the audacity to declare, presumably without consulting her colleagues to the right, that the government would make "the addressing of economic inequality and the cause of civil justice" a priority.'\n\n'By all means, we welcome measures aimed at addressing the plight of the rural poor and disadvantaged.  Our readers know many in need of such help.  But we must ask, in the name of good and decent government, whether government funds will be productively used; that is, whether we are teaching a man to fish, or simply handing them a fish.  We must be honest with ourselves; though many will claim they are in need, how many are truly deserving, and how many are simply in want?'\n\n- Editorial, p.4, The Savannah Register"

chase.open.11.desc:0 "Although President Smith and Michael Harrington had made common cause on civil rights throughout much of the decade, they had never been much more than casual acquaintances within the NPP.\n\n President Smith was from the old Republican establishment, working her way up on a broadly pro-business platform; Michael Harrington's odyssey from the Catholic Worker Movement and the Socialist Party of America made him far more concerned with rectifying the excesses of business, rather than promoting it.  But now here they were, two creatures of differing political camps in need of each other. \n\n Smith opened the meeting.  "Mr. Harrington, you know as well as I do that the NPP is being pulled apart between the Center and the Far Right.  And if we're going to get anything done in the next four years, I need at least one of the two to support legislation in Congress."\n\n"Believe me, the Center is more than happy to help, just as we have on civil rights in the past." Harrington replied brightly, before pausing. \n\n"I assume there's a 'but' coming?" Smith said. \n\nHarrington nodded.  "My colleagues and I joined the NPP to have a shot at reforms for the working class - real reforms, not just the kind of band-aid fixes proposed by the R-Ds and opposed by the Far Right.  And now here we are, with the Presidency in your hands." \n\n Harrington leaned forward.  "The question isn't whether you need MY support.  Do I have YOUR support, Madame President?""

Six cases of schoolchildren refusing en masse to exercise their right to attend public schools, fearing harassment and degradation.  And, most disturbingly, one reported lynching of an African-American man in Charleston, for the crime of daring to express their love for their white wife in public.'\n\n'Our readers would be forgiven for hoping that these are just memories of a past behind us, but these are the hate crimes reported to the NAACP over just the past month.  We cannot confirm whether these incidents are more frequent than those found widespread a decade ago, but we can confirm that the frequency of reports has increased since President Smith took office.  And despite this, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has scarcely increased its workload since the start of the Administration.'\n\n'President Smith, where is your conscience?  Have you abandoned your moral certitude, so often praised during your presidential campaign, in the pursuit of power?  Are your ethics, most famously arrayed against the persecutions of McCarthy, now inconvenient?  Must we conclude that justice is blind, and willfully so, against the crimes committed against African-Americans?'\n\n- Editorial, p.2, The Columbia University Daily Spectator"

"Seems to think that just because he's in consideration for the Ambassadorship to Canada that he's running our foreign policy."\n\n The Chief of Staff glanced over the headline, and visibly blanched.  'NPP REPRESENTATIVE ALLUDES TO OFN CONSULTATIONS ON SHARING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.' \n\n "Even if the Ambassador to Canada runs OFN affairs, that's one hell of a headline." The Chief of Staff turned to Smith.  "He was one of the first to back you in the election, though.  If we cut him loose, won't we start looking ungrateful?"\n\n "After my calls with the Japanese and Canadian Ambassadors, I guess I should be grateful he didn't start a nuclear war!"  Smith snapped.  "Tell the representative that he's out of consideration for the Ambassadorship.  Loose lips sink ships, and the rest of the NPP would do well to remember that.""

chase.open.70.desc:0 "Despite their common position in the Far Right caucus, Margaret Chase Smith and George Wallace got along like oil and water, with Smith's civil rights sympathies anathema to Wallace's championing of segregation.  The two had barely been on speaking terms during the NPP's years in opposition, focused on bringing the NPP to power and deposing the gutless R-Ds. \n\nBut governing?  That required a sustainable majority, and votes were precious in Washington, with a price tag to match - and so Wallace had been invited to a 'morning coffee' in the Oval Office.\n\n"Well, I'd love to help you, Madame President." Wallace said, flashing a genteel smile.  "Good roads, strong businesses, and sticking it to the Japanese.  I think we'd work well together."\n\nSmith mustered as neutral an expression as she could.  "And what about civil rights?" \n\nWallace grimaced.  "I won't pretend that the country's not moving how some of my fellows want it to, and I know America's going to be a different place after I'm dead and gone.  But right now, there's a lot of folks upset with how Washington's directing this from up high."  He made his pitch.  "We won't see eye to eye on the racial question, but I'm not asking for much.  Local traditions and local ways can change - but the work of America is done by free men, not by diktat.  Give the Southern states some freedom to breathe, and we'll give you our votes."\n\nSmith slowly finished her coffee, letting the dregs settle.  A voice in the back of her head warned her that this was how the work of Reconstruction had been left unfinished in the first place.  But even if Wallace admitted that his kind were going to go extinct someday, President Smith didn't have the luxury of waiting for that to happen."

"You think we should have ordered some alcohol to get the conversation started?" \n\nSmith glared back. "Don't get your hopes up. If alcohol helped solve the NPP's problems, we'd have drunk Washington dry - and I bet they'd still be staring each other down." \n\n"We get them together to talk about a party platform, and all we hear are crickets." Agnew said. "Funny, since there's no shortage of topics. Japan, the unions, those states' rights agitators. The goddamn R-D's." \n\nSmith let out an exasperated sigh, turning to the two sullen men. "Gentlemen, if neither of you will talk, I can read your talking points aloud..." \n\nWallace bit first. "Mr. Harrington believes that he has all the answers, from the cradle to the grave. A man's entitled to his beliefs - and believe me, the South has plenty, if only Mr. Harrington would listen!" \n\n"The last time the South had 'plenty of opinions,' we had a civil war." Harrington countered archly. "The struggles of the American people cross regional borders, and a platform that leaves America half wage slave and half free man is one I cannot sign.""

Agnew remarked. "Protections for the unions, the expansion of welfare programs, healthcare programs..." \n\n"He's not being unreasonable," Smith replied. "He's agreed to talk to the business lobbies for most of what he wants, and I'm sure they'll push back on his most outlandish plans. I'd expect no less of them." \n\n"And a free hand where Japan is concerned," Agnew concluded. "I guess we're all getting something that we want out of this." \n\nSmith frowned as the door to the Oval Office opened. Harrington walked back in, all smiles as he sat back down. There was no sign of Wallace. \n\nSmith fought down a growing unease. "Mr. Harrington, you didn't happen to see Mr. Wallace outside earlier, did you?" \n\n Harrington turned to Smith, his smile unchanged. "I don't think he'll be coming back. But we're in this together, Madame President, I can assure you of that much.""

chase.pol.3.desc:0 ""Let's go over this one more time," Vice-President Agnew said. \n\nHarrington and Wallace remained as silent as ever as Agnew went down the agreed items of the NPP's agenda. President Smith watched the unfolding scene with equal parts anticipation and dread. \n\n"The party commits, more or less, to opposing any policy initiative or momentum carried by the R-Ds.

Agnew read aloud from his notes, to which Harrington and Wallace both nodded. \n\nSo far, so good, Smith thought cynically. \n\n"We commit to the minor adjustments to the social safety net on a federal level-" Agnew continued, to Harrington's sharp nod and a faint hiss from Wallace. \n\n"And in exchange, we ensure that states have greater autonomy to set regulatory frameworks and corporate tax regimes," Smith hurriedly interjected. The intervention seemed to mollify Wallace, though Smith could also feel a withering stare from Harrington. \n\nIt was a scene that would repeat itself multiple times as Smith and Agnew finalized the NPP platform, a hodgepodge of scattershot promises and claims that served no unified purpose except to keep Harrington and Wallace in the same room with each other. \n\nBut at the end of the day, as the two leaders of the NPP's factions signed off on the document, President Smith sighed in relief.

Wallace's eyes narrowed. \n\n"You've never given me reason to believe otherwise from your time in Alabama." Harrington shot back. \n\nWallace's smile disappeared.

Together, they waited for the senators to open the first hearing of the Smith Administration's [GetYear] Defense Review - one of the many documents highlighting the NPP's 'decisiveness' against the fascist threat. \n\nThe committee chairman called the room to order. "As of last evening, Secretary of Defense Stennis has sent the [GetYear] Defense Review to this committee. The Administration hopes that this strategy, reflecting the painful lessons of South Africa, will mark a shift in our defense policy, with the Navy and Air Force leading the charge against the Empire of Japan." \n\nThe crowd nodded sagely, with the exception of two men: the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff. They were aware of the document's contents - in a prior draft. They had raised concerns over the Army's reduced role - or so they had thought. They most definitely had argued against cutting the Army's budget - and they had been ignored. \n\nMore than a little blindsided, the Army leadership floundered through their testimony in a desperate rearguard action.

Stennis sympathized, but the Army was losing sight of the bigger picture. \n\nIt was an old line, and the two Army leaders exchanged glances. The Secretary coughed nervously.

Stennis waved off his aides. \n\n"Mr. Secretary, do you have any comment about your shareholdings in Litton Industries and Ingalls Shipbuilding, and the recently announced plans to expand Navy shipbuilding?" \n\nIt was a poorly worded question, but the implications were unmistakable. The raucous journalist pool had fallen dead silent, while Stennis blinked twice in surprise. \n\n"I don't know what you mean to imply by that, but I can assure you that my personal business interests follow all ethical disclosure requirements. I have no further comment." Stennis scowled, and left the journalists to their feeding frenzy. \n\nAs he walked back to his office, he found himself coming back to that question. It was a clumsy smear; the stockholdings were disclosed, so it shouldn't have been a question at all, really.

The offending article was no simple editorial; it carried the signature of Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand, a veteran of the South African War still on active duty. He'd expected the bureaucratic pushback, and no politician worth their salt was surprised by dirty tricks and slander, but this? This was insubordination, or as close as one could get to it in the Army without directly disobeying orders. \n\n"I will court-martial that son of a bitch, I swear to God!"

The problem wasn't finding somebody; there were plenty of obsessive rules lawyers on Capitol Hill that delighted in causing endless frustration to their peers. \n\nNo, the problem was the same as ever: the NPP's endless factionalism.

That was hardly a cause for celebration, as an R-D legislator had pounced on the issue: \n\n"Instead of promptly escalating the matter to the President, the Secretary of Defense seemed to believe that he had the sole right to dismiss the concerns of our Army.

By tomorrow noon, the R-Ds would be demanding subpoenas, and the other newspapers in Washington would join them so that the Post wouldn't run away with the story. \n\nStennis had assured President Smith that his disclosure was above board, and Senator Jackson's patronage of Boeing was an open secret.

The worst appears to have been averted; the R-Ds have, somewhat sheepishly, retracted the weapons memorandum, while we can claim to have been, for once in this entire mess, in the right. \n\nUnfortunately, testimony concerning the specifics of weapons specifications and statistical analyses of failure rates in equipment tend to make the general public's eyes glaze over. Polling number still indicate that the shock of the R-D allegations - and the subsequent suspicion of the Smith Administration's military programs - remain entrenched, despite the evidence to the contrary."

chase.rog.16.desc:0 "A promising career, cut short by relegation to rear-echelon duties. Repeated instances of less qualified - or unqualified - candidates to senior billets, despite the presence of suitable alternatives. A culture of harassment morphing into toxic enmity in the ranks. These were the stories of African-American servicemen being resegregated in the Navy, recounted in searing detail in TIME magazine. \n\nPresident Smith laughed hollowly as she pored over the details in a deserted White House study. Damningly, these details had been corroborated by the Navy Inspector General, whose initial findings warned grimly that this was only the tip of the iceberg. Appended to the report were directives from Secretary of Defense John Stennis, tying him unmistakably to the chaos developing in the Navy. \n\nSmith sunk deeper into her thoughts, as protestors gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue. With this revelation, her struggle with the Army had exploded into the American public consciousness. The congressional hearings would enter high gear, with the R-Ds smelling blood in the water as the NPP fell into disarray yet again. \n\nSmith allowed herself a rare scowl. Stennis. That man - from his clumsy handling of the Army and now this - was nothing but trouble. But if she denounced him, the Far Right would see it as a slap in the face - and while it might neutralize the R-D's criticisms and mollify the Center, it would expose yet another fault line within the NPP at a time she could least afford it."

Congressional staffers, legal analysts, defense policymakers, and (what appeared to be) the entire Washington press corps took all of the sitting space in the room; photojournalists had to settle for sitting on the carpet, contorting their bodies in increasingly inventive ways to brace their cameras for the perfect shot. \n\nIn between her meetings, President Smith stole glances at the television, carrying a live feed of the Washington theater that was captivating the nation, from the testimony of African-American officers drummed out of the service to sailors involved in instances of racial brawls on bases - and in one instance, on an aircraft carrier's mess hall. The stories of failing discipline and discord within the services, and the NPP's role in causing it, were now painfully public. As the committee broke for lunch, President Smith had little difficulty imagining the rancor behind closed doors at the NPP, tearing itself apart over civil rights once again. After several long minutes, she made a call to Capitol Hill. \n\nAs the committee reconvened, the R-Ds opened with a single, piercing question: "Will the Administration rescind these unconstitutional policies that have so terribly impacted our servicemen?""

The phrases are ingrained in the cadet corps of the United States Army and Navy, expressed in their purest form in the annual Army-Navy football game. \n\nWhile the rivalry between the two is usually fierce, but collegial, the atmosphere today is different. The teams take to the field as a dark cloud has over the stands. The whistle blows, and the lines crash, harder and with a sharper crack than in years past. \n\nSlam! An Army linebacker breaks through and barrels into the Navy quarterback at top speed, throwing both to the ground. The Army cadets roar as the play stops, only to be matched by the Navy midshipmen as their quarterback lies motionless. Half of the Navy team marches to the Army huddle, who close ranks to defend their own. The two sides jostle, and the stands vibrate with a crackling animosity. \n\nAmidst the tangle, an Army linesman's helmet jerks backward from an errant fist. He slams into a Navy receiver, who tumbles violently into an Army cornerback. Pandemonium reigns as the teams descend into a brawl, teammates rushing from the sidelines as the energy of the stands explodes into a frenzy. \n\nAfterwards, a Pentagon spokesperson sheepishly attributes the incident, and its numerous injuries, to 'excessive exuberance.' The press is far less circumspect, comparing the football brawl to the recent mudslinging on Capitol Hill, lamenting the sorry state of a government too consumed by infighting to lead the nation."

"Turns out the Army plays dirty tricks with the best of them." \n\nPresident Smith sighed. She had hoped, against the evidence, that the Army would retain a semblance of professionalism. These hopes were now dashed, as Chief of Staff Bryce Harlow's investigation into the leaks tormenting her Administration had identified Brigadier General Alexander Haig as the link between the Army and the press, distributing the key memos linking John Stennis to the Navy's segregation debacle. \n\nResigning in protest, and then loudly complaining about it, was a time-honored tradition, and President Smith had resigned herself to dealing with the fallout of Stennis' mismanagement of the Army. But this level of trickery? It was behavior she'd come to expect from the R-Ds - but not from an Army looking to do an end-run around their President. \n\nHer hands shook gently as she took her reading glasses off, chewing on the arms in a quiet fury. If the Army wanted to play with fire, then they could burn: she could publicly axe General Haig, making an example of him to the cheers of the NPP. At the same time, she could imagine the fury that would inspire in the remaining Army staff, even if they got the message. Would satisfying her fury be worth it?"

He'd even gone so far as to advertise his 'good offices', if the President needed 'somebody to smooth things over with the Army.'\n\n"I've had enough of this," President Smith muttered, before slamming Harlow's investigation file onto the desk. "Read the first page aloud, General Haig. Tell me all about your friends in the press and on Capitol Hill."\n\nHaig fell silent. He didn't pick up the papers.\n\n"I don't care that you don't respect me; I'm not here to win your vote." President Smith said testily. "But if you can't respect the office of the Commander in Chief - if you can't pick up a piece of paper when I tell you to - then you need to get out."\n\nAnother few seconds of silence.

The response of your administration to these attacks has been admirable in its defense of the principles of our military, and I confess I struggle to think of what I could do better in your position. \n\nTo business: my inquiries with the Office of the Inspector General have revealed the existence of one 'Army Study Group OP-23.' Formed by General Westmoreland shortly before his resignation, this group has no clear mission except for 'studying' the Administration's military policies for the Army.

The Army officials at the hearing noticeably bristled in their seats. Some looked to the R-D's on the committee to offer them some cover. \n\nNone did. The R-D's offered vague platitudes to their NPP colleagues or otherwise spoke in stultifying generalities about the dangers posed by a military subverting civilian command. How close had America come to the tyranny of Japan or Germany? It would not do, they said, to let the matter fester any longer, despite their differences with the NPP. \n\nThe NPP was shocked, to say the least, by the sudden collegiality of their R-D colleagues.

And we have found instances where the administration should have acted more effectively." \n\n 'But we must express profound dismay at the disregard by senior officers of the Army towards their constitutional responsibilities, and at the duplicitous means by which they interposed themselves in the civilian politics of the nation. Our Republic holds the principle of civilian control sacrosanct; and in this, we find the Army's transgressions are far graver than any mistakes of the Administration.' \n\n'Therefore, this committee moves to call upon the Administration to take all necessary action to reinforce civilian control within the United States Army, while referring defense policy concerns back to their respective committees.

That's how it works, ma'am." The admiral excused himself, while President Smith surveyed the Oval Office and its occupants. \n\nVice-President Agnew. Her Cabinet, Kirkpatrick, Long, and Stennis.

Individually, herself included, they could merely manage America; but when they came together, they would truly lead America.\n\nAnd then there was the Army. They'd insisted on their privileges to the bitter end, kicking and screaming like a petulant child.

As the officers left, most could be seen without their starred shoulder boards, having left them on the President's desk. \n\nAnd when most of the next morning's papers carried the headline 'The Submission of the Admirals', most Americans scratched their heads in puzzlement, wondering if their government had any idea what it was doing."

The Japanese have paid greatly in blood in uprooting the foreigner from the land they exploit, and this effort will not be in vain. To have American naval presence in the South China Sea would be considered an insult to all those who gave their lives to the liberation of Asia, the countless tombs in the depths of the Pacific would be disgraced as soon as the approval is given. [Root.GetLeader] must not dare insult the legacy of heroes on which Japan's peace is built upon.\n\nAlternatively, the consequences of refusal must be considered.

Should we continue?" \n\nThe President's world slowed as she listened to the voice of Chafee over the phone. Those bastards actually sent out their ships, do they really have the gall to block us from retrieving our citizens' bodies from the open ocean? It was a navigational error for a diplomatic mission, not like we were dropping the bomb over Tokyo! The President's head swirled, not with the worry that plagued Americans at this point, but rather anger. One of the reasons for her nomination and election was her desire to fight back against Japanese persecution, and to hell if she won't stand by it. \n\nBut Kirkpatrick's words continued to float around her mind. Would Stennis have wanted this? To possibly embroil America into another war over some bodies, even his own? She may not have liked everything he had to say, but she agreed that he was as valid as anyone else to stand as an American, would it not serve him well to honor his wishes post mortem? \n\nHowever, the Japanese weren't going to wait for a decision from the United States to respond soon enough. "Madam President?" The Secretary of the Navy asked once more."

Several Japanese submarines have maneuvered through the open sea and fired several warning shots, demanding that we halt the advance. How shall we proceed, Madam?" \n\nAt the end of Chafee's report, the White House immediately rang the alarm. Tension had gone from denunciations and demands to the possibility of a Pacific War within a few short days. West Wing personnel gathered their belongings and prepared their defenses, preparing for a possible evacuation of the President and her Cabinet if need be. People were scared, terrified even, afraid that this would be their last day on this Earth. \n\nBut the President was bitter. She was angry, enraged that the Prime Minister and his ministry dared to sink to such levels over retrieving bodies from an accident, an accident that they damn well caused. She knew that it was their fault, the Imperial Army shot down innocent government workers who were on a diplomatic mission, and now could not bear the possibility of embarrassment. Even if it meant a war-torn Pacific. However, she could not help but know that her fellow Americans were scared. Her mind turned back to the history of the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, how, at the time, Vice President Kennedy managed to alleviate the fears of each and every American, even the ones standing beside her in the Congress, as each filled with terror at the thought of their death, yet Smith remembered her own anger and wish for revenge at that moment. Now, what would she do, alleviate tensions, or go for what is rightfully theirs? \n\n"Madam President?" Chafee interrupted."

Historical figures gazed onwards, but no living eyes came to meet them. Rather, all activity relating to the White House staff fell below several stories underground, as the President herself, her cabinet members, and several other military personnel have retreated to the underground command center. \n\n"President Smith, we are incurring heavy casualties around Sydney from the Japanese bombing campaign, we require immediate air support from our allies and the OFN, please, respond immediately!" pleaded the Australian Prime Minister. She remembered the beauty of Australia, they were a strong ally in the face of Japanese influence in the Pacific. Now, the Japanese have laid waste to the capital of their ally. \n\n"Madam President, the Fleet Admiral reports that the Seventh is making headway in beating back the Japanese fleet, but there's fears of reinforcements, should we continue the attack or wait to regroup with support?" Chafee spoke. Smith remembered her courage, wanting to fight back against the terror that the Japanese enforced against her beautiful country so long ago. Now, she has finally gotten what she wanted, as the Navy pounds against the Japanese Fleet in the South China Sea, where Secretary Stennis's body floats somewhere in the midst of a wrecked American aircraft. \n\nBut the President realized one thing: She did not feel any glory in it. Just thoughts about burning Australian cities and scared American sailors."

Finally, Japan was suffering defeat at the hands of Americans after nearly two decades of shame and instability after the second world war. Finally, Smith can claim that with her Presidency, she was destined to reclaim America's time in the sun, a time of glory, of victory, of success. \n\nBut, would it be that way? As the hours continued, she heard horrific reports of the aerial battles over Australia, as increasing amounts of American aircraft are shot out of the sky, until they reach their graves below, coated in fuel, fire, and blood. Land forces were ordered to mobilize and prepare for a full on invasion plan of the Pacific Islands, as various leading generals yelled at one another over competing battle plans and how to finally bring down the Japanese Empire, in their minds. On top of it all, the Seventh fleet reported that they're prepared to regroup, but the Japanese look to be preparing a counterattack, one which could decimate the fleet if they do not get the reinforcements they need out there. The Pacific was on fire, and the inferno was only spreading, as the Final Pacific War had begun! The United States refused to back down after its citizens deaths, for their pride, their honor, for Stennis! \n\nHowever, past all of the reports, drawings of battle plans, organizations of armies, and commands issued to navies, one thought dominated President Margaret Chase Smith's mind. \n\nHow launch codes for the nuclear arsenal of the United States was easily accessible in a briefcase near her, and her late husband's portrait she woke up to just days ago."

She had dealt with years of work in both houses of the United States Congress, a true crisis was bound to happen one day in her career, right? \n\nJeane Kirkpatrick stepped into the room, interrupting the President's inner thoughts, and as the President raised her head with a face of iron, she was met with a reserved smile across the room. "Mrs. President, the Prime Minister of Japan has decided to respectfully comply and meet with our demands. He is in the process of putting together a speech to recognize the Imperial Japanese Army's accidental shooting down of Mr. Stennis's aircraft, and is allowing complete access of the United States Navy to attempt to search for the wreckage, in order to 'alleviate tensions.' It appears as though you have managed to scare the Japanese off, Madam President." \n\n"Don't thank me, Jeane, thank yourself and the cabinet."

Having said that, she knows that Kirkpatrick was not entirely wrong either, Jeane was a smart person, maybe they just got out of step earlier? \n\nThe ringing of her office phone immediately snapped her attention from her thoughts. "Harlow, what have you got?" The President asked. "Madam President, we have a development from Tokyo. It appears that the Prime Minister has signaled that they do not wish to press the issue forward any longer, and 'seeing that tensions are high with the President' as he put it, has decided to grant access to the American Navy into the South China Sea to search for the wreckage, and hopefully recover Secretary of Defense Stennis. How should we proceed?" \n\nA slow smile crept across the President's face. After all that the Japanese had done to her country, her administration had finally gotten the Empire to take a few steps back.

If she backed down now, how could she ever say she stuck to her ideas? Finally, there was a knock at the door, General Maxwell Taylor, the soon-to-be Secretary of Defense, stood in the President's door. \n\n"Ma'am, there's been some progress. The Japanese Government has allowed their barring of the United States Navy to stand, but has rescinded any enforcement, allowing us to go in without challenge of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Shall we proceed?" The advisor stated. "Christ, we did it." The President said with a sigh of relief,	 sitting down as she brought her eyes back to General Taylor. "Alert Secretary Chafee that we are to proceed with the search, and to direct the Seventh fleet into the South China Sea to begin looking. "Right away, ma'am." Taylor said, before exiting the room. \n\nSmith took a moment to turn and stand, looking outwards into Washington D.C. through the windows of her office. We're getting the bodies back, to be sure.

Until finally, after several phone calls, she received the exact one she was looking for. "Secretary Chafee, what is there to report?" Chafee uttered a long sigh before answering.\n\n"Madam President, the Fleet Admiral reports that it appears as though the Japanese fleet is breaking formation and turning back."\n\nSmith's minds echoed words of thanks as she managed to let out a sigh of gratitude, after barely being able to breathe. "Continue as ordered, Secretary Chafee, and make sure that fleet is ready for anything out there, but we need to find those bodies." Smith ordered. After the click of the phone line, Secretary Kirkpatrick came in, looking equally as exhausted.

She didn't need to be reminded that things were not looking good. The newspapers, the TV news, just listening to the staff in the White House, everyone was talking about the imminent dissolution and political irrelevance of the National Progressive Party. Her goals, her efforts to unite the party was crumbling. Her efforts to make the NPP more than just the unending opposition to the Republican-Democrats, to turn it into an actual option for the American people, was falling apart.\n\n Agnew spread his hands as he stood in front of the desk, and took a deep breath. "I think we should make our positions clear, Madam President. You've been doing everything in your power to keep the party together, which has required making compromises that have annoyed some people. But that's how politics works. And all those on Capitol Hill know it. But they also need to know that loyalty is a two way street."\n\n Smith leaned forward in her chair. "What are you suggesting?"\n\nl "A declaration, a party message. Make it clear that you will listen and work with everyone in the party. However, when a decision has been made, it's important that we all work together to get it passed. Party unity is much, much more important than winning political points. That needs to be made crystal clear. But, at the same time, if you stand against the decision, if you break ranks, if you leave, then you are on your own. We won't help you. If you leave for the R-Ds, you are a person non grata."\n\n Chase pondered what her Vice President was suggesting. She knew very well that the NPP, born out of defectors from the major parties, could just as easily break apart again. But maybe a hard line, if totally unenforceable, was what was needed?\n\n "Very well. Let's do it.""

The NPP, always on the verge of fragmenting, was now on the verge of collapsing. Senators and Representatives were at each other's throats, spending more time in their speeches and press conferences attacking each other, filibustering their own parties' legislation. All this, while letting the Republican-Democrats lean back and watch the fireworks, occasionally throwing a bit more gasoline on the fire when they finally got the chance to stand up and speak at the podium. Journalists were loving every second of it. Newspapers were going wild with the stories that were coming out. Only TV networks, without film footage from a still camera shy Congress, were restrained from turning the Congress into a pay-per-view wrestling match.\n\n "What are you suggesting, Spiro?" President Smith said. She still was determined, and resolute, but she knew when she needed assistance. All her years in the House and Senate never prepared her for this. That's where the Vice President came in.\n\n Agnew was sitting on one of the couches in the center of the room, right above the carpeted Presidential Seal, legs crossed. "We just need some more time. I'll go to those Senators that are particularly vocal, encourage them, twist their arms, threaten to cut funding for their projects. Remind them that we all hate Japan. Whatever is needed, until I can get them to support our legislation. If they come around and support us, then the others should fall in line. And then, once these bills are passed, we can work on a big compromise."\n\n The President, shoulders squared against the shadows of the setting sun, turned around, and gave a nod of her head.

"How about we try to work with them, all of them, and try to get some support again?"\n\n The Vice President then spent the next ten minutes, quickly explaining his idea. Offer each faction of the party something they really want. This will be the biggest, grandest offer. The biggest item that every wing of the party could desire. Everyone will get something.\n\n "It will be expensive," Margaret Chase Smith said. "And will they all agree?"\n\n "They will have to," the Vice President replied. "What better chance will they have to get their pet projects into law? Just because their nominal party allies will also get something? That's just the price of politics."\n\n The President drummed her fingers on the desk, her polished nails tap-tap-tapping against the wood that many, many men had sat at for the past eighty years. How did they handle inter-party crises like this? Did Rutherford Hayes struggle to bring his Republicans in line? Woodrow Wilson and his Democrats?

With the spirit of Southern Hospitality, the meetings in the homes and offices of Senator Strom Thurmond, and George Wallace's hotel room in the Willard Hotel have been the scene of many a long night of drinks, smoking, and backroom politicking.\n\n Eventually, the leaders of the FR-NPP present Agnew with something they would want in the event of a massive bill. While the majority of the FR is segregationist and would love nothing better than to roll back civil rights, that is off the table thanks to the public pressure. However, they also fought for the "little man" and those left behind, and so they wanted something else: a massive aid program for the South. Low or no interest loans for farmers, subsidies for new industries, and efforts to alleviate the impoverishment of the region that stretched back as far as the aftermath of the Civil War. And of course, every Senator, Representative and Governor will have their own pork barrel project: a big bridge across an uncrossed river, a contract to a local business, or some new courthouses and police stations.\n\n Now, any administration could propose such a program and most likely get it through Congress. However, the problem is that it would be massively expensive, and with all the other possible additions to the bill it could make the national debt balloon and make many deficit hawks start screaming to the heavens. So, will we play ball and add what the FR-NPP wants, or try to pass the law without their support?"

One of the unofficial leaders of the Centre wing of the National Progressive Party, Scoop has long been a strong proponent of civil rights.\n\n Wasting little time, Senator Jackson has told Agnew what his supporters in the C-NPP would want in the grand compromise bill: a massive education bill, giving money to raise the standards of schools around the country. Money would be provided to refurbish and repair schools, provide new textbooks, train more teachers, hire nurses and qualified therapists, provide a robust school lunch system, improve school gymnasiums, playgrounds and other activities, and much more. This would mostly focus on schools in the inner cities of the Northeast and Midwest that have been suffering since the rise of "white flight" to the suburbs in the past couple of decades, which have resulted in gaps in funding and the drop of test scores and the prospects for their graduates, if they even can.\n\n Sponsoring an education bill that would give a lot of money to schools around the nation is a pretty popular idea (after all, who doesn't want to help the children?), but adding it to this law will be very expensive and add a lot of red ink to the federal budget. So it's up to Vice President Agnew if he wants to add this to the bill to unify the NPP or not."

As one of the two main leaders of the Centre wing of the National Progressive Party, it's vital that Agnew find out what he wants to try to bring the party closer together.\n\n Harrington's strong support for the working class has never faltered, and his proposal to the VP is massive in scope: the establishment of a federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, to facilitate collective bargaining and rule on unfair labor practices.\n\n The NLRB, in Harrinington's view, would give more power to the workers and their unions, and rebalance the American economy away from the single minded efforts of wealth generation for the already rich and wealthy, but to enable safe workplaces, a living wage, and benefits for employees, and to enforce fines and penalties on companies that attempt to suppress unions. Harrington said he would like to make this new body as non-partisan as possible, so he'd be willing to have members of the FR-NPP, and maybe even R-Ds, to sit on it's board.\n\nWhile the idea of supporting unions and their millions of dues-paying members is a sound political strategy, and wouldn't even be horribly expensive compared to other programs and ideas members of the NPP have proposed, it would result in more costs for companies with the higher wages and increased standards required, and some of the conservative, pro-business politicians of the NPP would be loathe to support such a measure. The Vice President has to decide if the NLRB will be worth putting in to the bill."

The wily, controversial New York lawyer has been chosen by the pro-business, conservative elites of the North to speak on their behalf in this effort to unify the party.\n\n Cohn's remedy is straight and to the point: cut taxes. Explicitly, cut the taxes on some of America's largest corporations, and perhaps a few of the very rich as well. After decades of mismanagement by a bloated federal government dumping the hard earned wealth of "job creators" and the "engines of prosperity" into a black hole of bureaucracy and thousands of niche programs, it's time to reward these guys and their companies with a bit of a kickback. With these new resources, they can invest back into the economy by expanding their business, hiring new workers, acquire new technology and all that good stuff that will, undoubtedly, make everyone much, much better off in the long run.\n\n It's hard to tell how much of what Cohn is suggesting is true, that these companies need just a few million more tax-free dollars to make their companies grow even more, or if it's really just an excuse to grant even larger paychecks to the executives or dividends to the stockholders. The gap in revenue from lower corporate taxes will have effects on other parts of the federal budget that will have to be covered with raised taxes elsewhere, or even more debt. It's up to Agnew to determine if it will be worth the cost."

Even if everyone had a chance to go over all the details, and debate the bill on the floor of the Senate, voting against the bill will likely result in you voting against your own best interests, both in having popular suggestions scuttled, or in having your supporters consider you a traitor, corrupted by the Washington elite.\n\n While not everyone got what they wanted in the bill, hopefully enough people, from enough factions of the party, did so that they will vote for it.

Toss some more generous welfare benefits to appease Harrington and Jackson, some directed funding to the south to appeal to the segregationists, a few Buy American riders and regulation cutting for the businessmen. Hell, even a couple of the last radical ideas of the LNPP and Yockey's bunch are being tossed in, just to make sure there is enough votes.\n\n Of course, only a few people actually know that it's Spiro Agnew who's suggested this to the President, and not her idea alone. And even Agnew, the wily political operator that he has become in the past few months, knows that this is a risky move, as most of these measures are being slipped into the budget at the last minute, with little debate or scrutiny.

In her efforts to unify the National Progressive Party, and by engaging in corruption and backroom deals with taxpayer's money, she has lost the support of all of America.\n\n"I have great respect for Margaret Chase Smith, the person. I never would have agreed to be her running mate if this was not the case. However, Margaret Chase Smith, the President, has clearly let the power get to her head. She thinks that everyone will follow her if she just gives them money, that she can buy loyalty, or if it's not enough, then bully and drive out those that speak against her policies and ideas. This, however, is no way to run a country. As this is the United States of America, one of the oldest democracies on this earth, we should value dissenting opinions, and engage in reasoned and fair debate, and let the best ideas win. I can no longer support a President who goes against this truth."\n\nIn the darkened Oval Office, a manicured hand clutched the TV remote with a death grip, trembling as a knife was driven into her back.\n\nIn an old, run down store in Mississippi, three men watch the black and white TV, as VP Spiro Agnew denounces her boss on national television.\n\n"Fucking knew it," the first one said, scowling.

If you are Margaret Chase Smith, you just throw money at the problem. It's even better when it's not your own cash.\n\n The budget for [Get Year] that Vice President Spiro Agnew has negotiated and helped put together now has so many extra riders, amendments and provisions on it that it will take an army of accountants and lawyers to square it up with the laws of the nation. And it will undoubtedly cost a whole lot more than anyone could have ever dreamed possible. It's not to say that everything added to the bill is simple pork-barrel spending, building bridges to nowhere, erecting airports where there are no airplanes, or multi-lane highways to connect tiny villages (though some opponents will find their fair share of targets to rail against). Many of the programs are indeed in the best interests of the American people, and by lumping them all together it will be easier to get them enacted.\n\n President Smith can rest easy tonight: the National Progressive Party is working together for now, and her popularity is trending upwards again."

If you are Margaret Chase Smith, the answer seems to be that it's next to impossible.\n\n The debate and politicking to get the different wings of the party working together to try to get the Budget of [Get Year] put together to give everyone some of what they want has run on too long, resulted in too many frayed tempers and shouting matches, and even a fistfight or two, so Vice President Spiro Agnew has basically ignored all of the proposals, writing his own version of the budget with a couple allies in Congress. On the surface, all the programs and ideas that had been suggested by the different wings of the NPP have been added in, but digging into the numbers, it's clear that they are much reduced, with only a fraction of the money asked for.\n\n This action is yet another "Intolerable Act" by the party leadership, as one C-NPP Congressman declared, referencing the laws that pushed the colonies to revolt almost 200 years ago. Already many members of the NPP, excepting those of Smith's and Agnew's faction of the FR-NPP, are crying foul, and it seems clear that this effort at party unity is dead in the water."

However, the primary victim of the bill's failure, or more appropriately, non-starter, is landing on the White House. The fact that President Maragret Chase Smith, having already brought the NPP into chaos and collapse, apparently has no interest in negotiating with anyone to get out of the mess, and has resulted in more rumored defections and speculation fracturing of the NPP coalition.\n\n While spokespeople for the President, speaking off the record of course, are saying it was Vice President Agnew who had suggested the plan in the first place, and seemingly tried to sabotage it to undermine the President, but few are taking this suggestion seriously.\n\n Either way: the National Progressive Party is in crisis, and there now seems to be no way to fix it."

The more Center would hate it by definition, and there was no telling how such a move would look to the press.\n\nSmith thought back to the recent meetings she had with Itliong and Chavez. The easiest solution could be agreeing to Larry's terms; agreeing to raise the minimum wage would be seen as radical by some, but was sufficiently progressive enough to placate the Center without antagonizing the right too much. A peaceful, negotiated end to the strikes would have its advantages... if all the farmers agreed to it. \n\nAnd then, there was Chavez. Going along with his plan would likely elicit a violent reaction from the Far Right; increasing pensions and reducing work hours, not just at Delano but attempting to do so nationwide, would be a showstopper for the Far Right.

Schenley and DiGiorgio quickly found new laborers to cross the broken line and resume work - with token concessions, but nothing close to what Chavez and Itliong, now facing jail time, had agitated for. \n\nThe Smith Administration said nothing.

The National Guard would then be deployed only in limited numbers to protect scabs and federal workers from the strikers.\n\nA potential compromise solution, presented after the meeting by Nathan Wolkimir of the National Federation of Federal Employees and backed by the friendly union leaders Alan Whitney and John Griner, aims to split the UFPC and thus leave Rademacher's NALC as clear leaders of the strike.

The UFPC remains defiant, but ain't strong enough to disrupt national mail services on their own without the other unions or backing from the AFL, especially not as National Emergency Proclamation 3972 grants us unlimited emergency powers to use the National Guard for filling any holes in the mail rooms. We plan on leaving this order in place in perpetuity, even if Congress doesn't like it. No damn nicks are going to undermine our economy like this again; the strikers wouldn't dare lay a hand on the National Guard again after that brass-balled corporal mowed down six of'em couple weeks back. Our friend the NY-AG assures us the ringleaders like Biller and Sombrotto are going away for a long time. Gentlemen; we got'em.""

chase.1000.desc:0 "President Smith and Vice-President Agnew steeled themselves as they held court with Michael Harrington and George Wallace. The biweekly conclave was the seniormost forum of the NPP empowered to resolve disputes between the two - which meant that only the most intractable disagreements ever made it on the agenda. \n\nSmith and Agnew had come to dread the meetings, which often saw them futilely mediating between Wallace's outbursts and Harrington's preaching. More than once, the meetings ended only when Harrington and Wallace were exhausted, offering concessions just to get out the room. The President and the Vice-President reviewed the day's agenda. Union security agreements and the corporate tax. A recipe for disaster. \n\nThe minutes passed. Harrington pressed his case for ensuring that unions could collect operational dues from all employees, unionized or not. Wallace listened silently, before laying out his demand for a five percent cut in the corporate tax rate, to incentivize investment. The two eyed each other - and said nothing, an implied quid pro quo that stunned Smith and Agnew into silence. \n\nAfter the meeting ended on schedule, Agnew raised his eyebrow. "Do you think those two are warming up to each other?" \n\nSmith folded her arms as she sunk into her chair. "Probably not, but if this is as good as it gets, I'll take it.""

chase.1001.desc:0 "The corridor in the Senate basement reeked of cigarette smoke and the body odor of the ever-present gaggle of journalists, fishing for a choice headline outside the committee room hosting a meeting of the NPP congressional caucus. \n\nA younger journalist, puffing on a cigarette as he leaned against the wall, nudged his colleague with his elbow. "Think anybody's gonna comment on Harrington and Wallace's pissing match last night?" \n\n"What do you think? It's the NPP. I wish they'd complain more, it'd make all our jobs easier." A veteran reporter responded gruffly, toying with a pencil tucked into his disheveled hair. \n\nThe committee doors opened, and the reporters sprung to life, shouting questions and leaning forward as far as they dared,without obstructing the path of the departing Senators. An offhand comment, a scowl, even their pace and stride; there were no details too minor to escape the notice of the press pool on the hunt. \n\nAnd yet, today, there would be nothing. The NPP contingent departed the room together, led by a Center man, who brushed away the notebooks thrust towards him, followed by a man of the Far Right, who just shook his head as he walked past. Today, the exchange was entirely one-sided, with the NPP's facade refusing to crack as the journalists' questions faded into a dejected silence. Besides the usual bluster of Wallace and the diatribes of Harrington, which were entirely public knowledge, there would be no scoops in tomorrow's papers."

The room's split clean down the middle and nobody's talking to each other. \n\n1040: Strategy session for upcoming special elections interrupted. Harrington jumped the gun and is running his mouth off over at the Brookings Institution. Definitely not part of the plan, getting sent over to assess the damage. \n\n1115: Harrington was smiling like a cat when he finished. Can't imagine Wallace will be pleased with Harrington's wild promises again - and maybe that was the point. \n\n1245: Scoop's trying to get Wallace on the phone to run damage control, but he's been 'out'. For twenty minutes. Wonder how this will end. \n\n1530: Wallace's gone running to the press, as usual. He's been bitching about Harrington, as usual. Legislators are saying whatever they want to the press, as usual. Nothing's getting done today. \n\n1650: POTUS dragged Harrington and Wallace into the Oval Office earlier in a come-to-Jesus moment.

Senator Henry Jackson faced the men from the Center and the Far Right, at wits' end. The resentment had accumulated like so much dust, starting with clandestine side meetings over contentious policies, leading to arguments over committee seniority, and finally devolving to frequent committee recesses just to prevent a public walkout. \n\nAnd if the essence of leadership came from the top, the White House wasn't helping. The President no longer presided; she was partisan, and that had just added fuel to the fire. Now, even simple things were exercises in Sisyphean futility, and Jackson had to watch it all. \n\nThe two NPP 'colleagues' refused to answer Jackson's plea for unity. Sighing, Jackson looked back at his list, mostly scratched out. "What about O'Hara? He's a lawyer, a member of the local Chamber of Commerce-" \n\n"No." The Far-Right representative cut Jackson off. "He's NAACP; how am I selling that to Wallace?" \n\nThe Center man bristled. "So we're only running racists in the South these days?" \n\nAs the two returned to insulting each other, Jackson crossed off yet another name in the list, and sighed. At this rate, the R-D's might end up getting the seat after all."

chase.eco.1.desc:0 "Margaret steeled herself when Agnew announced his Oval Office visit with a jaunty tune. More often than not, a good day for the phlegmatic Vice President foretold a litany of headaches in hers. She eyed the newspaper roll tucked into the sauntering man's arm crook.\n\n"Madam President," he said, proffering today's issue of The Washington Post. Margaret swiped it off his hands and unfurled its pages; half a second later, the newspaper flew an arc onto a switched-on paper shredder atop the Resolute Desk. With barely-repressed glee, the President watched the contraption tear Strom Thurmond's raisin-wrinkled mug, and the bold-faced words "'PINKO-LOVING TURNCOAT': SEN. THURMOND BLASTS MCS IN SESSION", into ribbons of day-old paper.\n\nShe turned her withering glare to Agnew, who shrugged as he dusted bits of Thurmond and libel off his lapels. "Can't say I didn't warn you, Ma'am."\n\nThe President of the United States ground out a long-suffering sigh. She pretended the simper her advisor sported was a trick of the light."

chase.eco.2.t:0 "Deliberations"
chase.eco.2.desc:0 ""Run it by me again."\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Russell Long adjusted his reading glasses as he pored over the bill's final draft. "Cookie-cutter union reform: protections against sudden layoffs if you're unionized and employed, heavier fines for employers who break the rules, not-so-clear explanations about what counts as employed-"\n\n"And cause for discontent," interjected Vice President Spiro Agnew, "within the Party's rank-and-file as of late."\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith nodded. "About as I expected," she said. Her attention turned to the Situation Room's other occupants. "Jeane?"\n\nSecretary of State Jeane Kirkpatrick grimaced. "We shouldn't give in to the radicals any more than we already have," she muttered, arms crossed.\n\nThat meant the vote was now 1-1, minus Agnew. "John?"\n\n"All I know is wrangling JCS, Madam President," said Secretary of Defense John Stennis shruggingly. "I'd appreciate if that's all I'll ever need to know."\n\nAlso as expected: the Pentagon's neutrality unless their budget was on the line. That left the tiebreaker within the President's circle. She locked her stare with her Vice President's. "Ted?"\n\nAfter a moment of silent dithering, Agnew sighed out:"

"I thought so too, ma'am. As it turned out, we were both wrong."\n\nThe luncheon began with high hopes tacked to it by everyone involved. Wall Street needed something to reassure its stockholders just as much as the President needed something to reassure the Rightists that she wasn't just brown-nosing Harrington and his ilk. Pundits, insiders and the press corps - the Three Norns of the Beltway - had already trumpeted the consequent meeting as a reaffirmation of a symbiotic relationship as old as the Civil War.\n\n'So much for trusting precedent,' thought the President grumblingly.\n\n"I personally wouldn't call labor reform part of precedent-"\n\n"What did I say about listening to my thoughts, Ted?""

chase.eco.4.t:0 "Regarding Funding"
chase.eco.4.desc:0 ""As it is," spoke Secretary Long as he shuffled through the bill's draft, "the proposal assumes we - and by we I mean Congress and the White House - will shoulder the majority of the program's expenses. GAO published the ten-year cost projections for it around a week prior."\n\n"How much?" said President Smith.\n\nThe Secretary pursed his lips for a long moment, before responding with a conservative estimate. "Hundreds of billions."\n\nLike a choir, the Cabinet Room sucked sharp breaths in tandem. Silence reigned until Vice President Agnew chimed in with a suggestion. "Suppose we let the states fund a portion themselves."\n\n"Then the costs go down. Considerably. Getting them onboard is another problem entirely..."\n\nLong trailed off. Smith filled in the gaps herself - one gap shaped like the American South, in particular. Still added expenses for their state governments, but with much more leeway on what to spend, how much to spend... and who they should spend on. The federal government would have no choice in the latter.\n\nWith the specter of Wallace looming over their heads, Margaret Chase Smith decided:"

The speeches themselves might as well have been carbon copies of each other at first covers' glance, with the same words, the same margins and even the same headings - excepting every copy's page eight.\n\nIn the first draft's version, President Smith spent three whole paragraphs extolling the virtues of expanded,  if not universal healthcare, and the specific initiatives her administration will enthusiastically pursue towards that end. The second's replaced the aforementioned excerpts with detailed plans for improving labor protections for every American worker. The third had a page eight inasmuch as it lacked a page twelve; vague, off-handed references to poverty relief dispersed throughout the text substituted for condensed policy proposals that took up a whole leaf.\n\nWhen Agnew returned, he immediately fed two of the drafts to a paper shredder.

"It's the best deal we've got, all things considered."\n\nThe Representative's eyes seemed to flash an angry white at her rebuke. "Is it now? I've read the bill end to end; with how little it actually solves all the paper you've wasted on it's worth only for toiletry!\n\n"Where are the just shares for laborers working eight-to-eights eight days a week?" he roared, making wide, sweeping gestures of his arms with every crescendo. "Where are the lifelines between America's cornucopian fields and America's teeming famished? Where are our safeguards against predators with more wealth than the Lord and none of His mercy?"\n\nBy now the bill had become an uneven layer of office paper blanketing the Great Seal in white, circumscribing an angry, panting Jeremiah. "This is no proposal Madam President: this is an ultimatum guised as one. And there will be no deal unless you deal with the people with better faith than what you had offered me.

Both switched between boring holes into her skull and into their opposite's through sheer force of will. Cigar smoke wafted from an ash tray, just beyond her shaky fingertips, atop a table carved out of a shipwreck. The grandfather clock had just struck an ungodly hour: ten, midnight, quarter to four.\n\nThe President sighed. What a perfect microcosm of the NPP. God willing, an inaccurate one come - she glanced at the clock, its arms fixed at half past two - the early morning.\n\nOne moment stretched into several dozen as neither Smith, nor Harrington, nor Thurmond said a word. Then, lips wavering yet pursed, the Missourian spoke up. "It's agreeable," Harrington admitted. "Not optimal, not sufficient, not even acceptable. But someone," he side-eyed a certain Senator, "will do their damndest to block the vote himself if we ask for more."\n\n"For once I agree with the Communist," replied Thurmond. "At the least, we've each made fair concessions for the Party's sake. Repercussions can be handled later; now's time we show the R-Ds America had made their best choice in twenty Goddamn years."\n\nDisbelief gave way to relief and Margaret's weight against the velvet-lined chair. For lack of anything worthwhile to say, she pinned the lit cigar between her fingers and welcomed Havana into her shriveled lungs."

Loam soil and dry grass - the earthy scents of summertime in a Cuban plantation -  wafted through the portico's air as she puffed its rich smoke.\n\nShe glanced past her shoulder. "Do you think they enjoyed the parting gift, Ted?"\n\nThe President saw off the Rose Garden's last esteemed guest with ten such cigars encased in a leather box twice her palms wide and set with gold inlays. Her Chief of Staff did good work in ordering enough for every attendee, some several dozens in all. The cost might haunt her wallet tomorrow morning; then again, nobody said impressed millionaires weren't expensive.\n\nWhat common sense does say is that impressed millionaires are worth their weight in gold. More specifically, their pockets'.\n\n"Anyone would welcome a gift from the Preisdent ma'am," offered Agnew, voice muffled from the handkerchief enveloping half his face. "Even ones that kill you in twenty years."\n\nThe President smiled despite the dig at her habit. Now was time to celebrate small victories, like the compromise she had just brokered with her congenial acquaintances in the Fortune 500. Will Thurmond and friends paint her red so soon after she made peace with the captains of industry bankrolling the party's warchests?"

She is a friend and a colleague in the Senate, among the first to represent her state's true interests when the Republicans and Democrats no longer did. That she became the first Madam President in our history serves as an inspiring reminder that anyone, even those of the fairer sex, can lead the Free World if they worked hard and did their best.\n\n(SEN. THURMOND pauses to sip water.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Which brings me to my one complaint against her. You've no doubt already heard of the President's addresses as of late, whether from the radio, print, TV or even word of mouth. They told of the so-called "welfare for the American people", and the prosperity it'll bring for everyone. But don't be fooled: the President spoke of handouts in all but name.\n\n(Murmurs erupt from the audience.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Our grandpappies always tell us that the man who's taught to fish will live a full life 'til he's old and grey, and that a man who knows only how to take fish from others will take his way to an early grave. We'll have failed the Founders indeed if America turns from a nation of fishers to a nation of fish-takers. That may do for the reds and their misguided allies. But will it do for us? Will it do for hardworking Americans, like you and I? Must it do for our daughters, the new generation of American citizens, and who'll soon fill your shoes twenty years from now and nurture the next?"

How the tiny weight leaned against his side realigned her schedule to match his was a mystery James held no interest in probing; in any case, Foreman Rosie had joined him in listening to President Smith's address this evening.\n\n"That's what folks like her like to do to us," his old friend continued. "Swindle us with false promises and leave us out to dry when we come asking for help."\n\nJames hummed, picking at his answer with a mental comb. "Then again," he replied, "the President's a Rightist; she's already sticking her neck out against the party line in live TV. Maybe she really will hold her end of the deal?"\n\n"She won't!" Rosie yelled - well, less "yelled" and more "mewled", like Deuce when he was just a kitten fit snug on James's palm. "Bet ten bucks she'll backtrack on her 'handouts' soon as she finds an excuse." \n\nRosie had dozed off on the married man's shoulder by the time he thought of a response.

With his free hand, he pulled out the bottle and presented its ornate cover. "Moët Impérial," he said, faint hints of regret coloring his faux-French accent. "Mr. Haller recommended taking one from our dwindling French reserve."\n\nShe set aside her cigar on an ashtray, besides which two thin flutes sat atop a small round pan. A pop and fizzle later, and the bottle was open. Agnew poured just enough to fill exactly three-fourths of either glass with its sparkling amber liquid. He gingerly lifted one flute, nodding at the President. "I suppose here's when you deliver a heartfelt speech to our recent successes?"\n\nSmith rolled her eyes. "I'd have booked a reservation in the Old Ebbitt if I had more than a toast in mind for tonight." She clinked her glass against the Vice President's.

#JEANE Kirkpatrick
USA.1704.t:0 "This Land is Her Land"
USA.1704.d:0 "She did not know how many had come to the National Mall today, staring back at her in a sea of blank, unknown faces. Less than a minute ago it was pomp-and-circumstance; a long ceremony, a marching band, a bible, and a cacophony of cheers. In that minute, something had changed. The woman at the podium was now the most powerful on Earth, with all the hope or dread that accompanied such a fact. Now, perhaps a million voices lay quiet, with their expectant owners wrapped in scarves and coats anxiously awaiting the words of their new President: Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick.\n\n"Among the foremost duties of a government in the provision for the common defense; a guarantee, against external aggression, the survival of our way of life. We must ask ourselves: is the government fulfilling such duties? As evidenced by foreign troops on rightful American soil, and the continued warnings from military men that our current strategy is ineffective, and my very presence on these steps, perhaps the answer is "No". I have been elected and approved by the American people to head a new presidential administration. I know full well the responsibilities placed in me by them and by God, and will fulfill them to the best of my ability..."\n\n"...The troubles faced by our nation today cannot be solved by a single man, or woman. It does not require the sacrifice that so many have made in service to democracy, as in the Argonne, or on Bougainville, or on the dunes of the Namib. However, it does require the best effort of every citizen to believe in themselves and their capacity for great deeds. In this endeavor, I have the utmost confidence in the people of the United States to adapt to and overcome their challenges, for we are the progeny of almost two centuries of great individuals. We are America, and with our exceptional will and the grace of God, no trial shall prove too great for our strength to overcome.""

POLITICS_KIRK_DESC:0 "그렇게 진보적이지 않은 정치인 대다수는 여성이 대통령직을 맡기에는 너무 유약하다고 여겨 왔습니다. 여성의 부드러움에 너무 약해질 것이라는 거였죠. 이제 이 멍청이들과 회의론자들은 정치적 강심장을 지닌 여성인 진 듀언 커크패트릭에 대한 경외심과 공포로 줄을 서고 있습니다. 한때 극우파의 초기 멤버였던 커크패트릭은 석유파동이 극에 달하면서 급속히 정치적 주목을 받았습니다. 그녀가 통달한 지정학과 지니고 있는 확고한 결단은 대통령 선거를 상대적으로 쉽게 이기게 하였습니다. 이제 대통령으로서 그녀는 "커크패트릭 독트린"이라 불리는 것을 지지합니다. 나치의 전체주의를 막기 위해서 미국은 미국에게 우호적인 독재정권을 지원해야 한다는 지정학적 수칙인 것이죠. 이 개념은 많은 사람들의 분노를 자아냈지만 목적을 달성할 것이라는 데에는 그다지 반론이 없습니다. \n\n오클라호마 태생인 커크패트릭은 컬럼비아 대학교에서 수학하면서 미국사회당의 청년조직인 "청년 사회주의 연맹"의 일원이기도 했습니다. 컬럼비아에서 정치학을 공부하면서 그녀는 사회주의에 대한 열정을 잃어갔고 결국 사회주의가 성공하기 위해서는 인간 본성의 근본적인 변화가 필요하다고 결론내렸습니다. 많은 해 동안 그녀의 보수적 관점은 다른 사람들에 비해 증대되었고 그녀에게 남은 것은 냉정성, 무자비함 그리고 실용주의였습니다. 1968년 박사학위를 취득한 커크패트릭은 노골적인 극우파가 되었고, 민권법 논란의 종결 직후부터 그녀의 외교정책에 대한 중점은 극우파의 재정립에서 큰 역할을 하였습니다.\n\n이제, 실용적이고 계산적인 철의 여인이 백악관 집무실에 있고, 부드러운 국가를 천천히 그녀와 같이 굴하지 않는 생명체로 변모시키고자 합니다.

 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_presidency_desc:0 "The election of the academic and former diplomat Jeane Kirkpatrick has surprised even the most shrewd political analysts- a woman with limited political experience and a controversial background was not the top choice for one of the two major political parties. Swept into office on an NPP surge in the aftermath of the oil crisis, she now faces the task of restoring confidence in the executive office and the reputation of the United States abroad.\n\nThis task will be a daunting one- though over the initial shock of the oil crisis, America is still in a vulnerable economic state and beset by domestic unrest. President Kirkpatrick is prepared to respond to both problems swiftly, to curb the influence of radicals and restore certainty in the future of our nation!"

 USA_kirk_72_meet_with_the_director_desc:0 "The CIA has maintained a mandate to operate without serious oversight by the president for almost three decades. They have been left to effectively run themselves, promoting a culture of stagnancy and inefficiency, wasting money on speculative science of dubious value and initiatives that lacked a clear direction. This ends now.\n\nThe intelligence community is a critical part of the president's new foreign policy initiative, for it is the most capable tool by which we can take advantage of the weaknesses of ideologically opposed governments. We've already tapped a new candidate for Director. Once they're approved by Congress, a meeting must be held immediately. Langley and the West Wing must operate in close coordination to properly accomplish our objectives."

 USA_kirk_72_open_the_floodgates_desc:0 "When it comes to dealing with subversive elements within the United States, we do not have the luxury of a light touch. Change cannot be dictated by small groups of sign-waving radicals who only care for their own pet causes. Ideas that fail to thrive in the marketplace of democracy cannot be given special treatment, but these radicals fail to realize the harm they do to the nation.\n\nOperation CHAOS will enable us to monitor and suppress these dangerous organizations. The majority will simply be monitored, those found to be dangerous will be suppressed by our own front organizations, and the most dangerous ones will be targeted for dismantlement. If sufficient legal evidence to arrest prominent dissidents cannot be found, it will be created. Democracy will represent the will of the people, not radical fringe movements."

 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_doctrine_desc:0 "Our foreign policy has been fundamentally misguided since the great mistake of South Africa. For too long we have been guided by naive idealism and a masochistic devotion to supporting governments that proclaim freedom and anti-fascism. This must be ended.\n\nThe newly sworn-in president is known for her new pragmatic and realistic approach to foreign policy. Instead of bending to the naive desire to promote liberty and democracy on a world scale, we must recognize that we must foster democracy through the establishment of strong and stable governments that can serve as a solid foundation for the future of a global alliance. These governments must not be weakened by our attempts to inorganically democratize them, but instead must be hardened against outside influence from our geopolitical rivals and internal revolutionary movements alike."

 USA_kirk_72_make_the_shipments_desc:0 "President Kirkpatrick is not a woman to be trifled with, nor will she allow, under her guidance and command, for the United States to be bullied around by the rest of the world. Out in the tropics of the Carribean, pirates reigned and scourged the seas of the colonists forging their way there. Now, however, Authoritarians and Fascists more than make up for the long-dead scourges, as the heartless dictators open the way for the Germans and the Japanese to sink their teeth into America's underbelly. And, like the strong will of British law centuries ago, we shall see them hang.\n\nMost notably, the hangman reaches for the regime of Joaquin Balaguer, who has managed to imprison his "Republic" in a gridlock of authoritarianism and oppression. While the opposition striving for democracy crawls in the shadows, however, we shall ship over our best arms and ammunition to ensure a fiery end to the unjust reign of Balaguer over the Dominicans."

 USA_kirk_72_begin_the_destabilization_desc:0 "Revolutions can have an endless supply of guns, bullets, and bombs to blast their way through the opposition government; however, if they don't have the popular support and the manpower to use all that equipment, then not a damn thing is going to end up happening.\n\nThus, it is now our duty to begin reinforcing the foundations of revolution and revolt against the Fascist-sympathetic governments across the waves. For now, hundreds of thousands have rallied in the name of standing against the dictatorship of Balaguer and his collaboration with Fascist powers, from the streets of Santiago de los Caballeros to the cabinets in the capital of Santo Domingo de Guzmán. People are tired of giving in to the wanton wants and desires of Fascists, and President Kirkpatrick is more than happy to oblige their defiance."

 USA_kirk_72_find_a_frontman_desc:0 "Washington. Bolívar. Lenin. Castro. All of these men stand greatly different from one another, and we may not like some of them, but they all have one commonality with one another: being the shining star behind a long-built, hard-fought revolution that forged a new path in history, and a new life for all of their constituents. The brewing conflict in the Dominican Republic needs such a revolutionary actor, someone courageous, someone charismatic, someone willing to do all that it takes to earn their people freedom and America its ally to the Southwest, to shield the continuous strikes of the Fascist Axe against the doors to the New World. Sure, some may call the practice of searching for such a face to the revolution "outdated," or accuse it of limiting the breadth by which the revolution can expand for the country. However, America's best interests lie in the safeguarding of the revolution, and a shining star can help kickstart the progress as quickly and securely as possible."

 USA_kirk_72_rally_the_party_desc:0 "The Far Right of the National Progressive Party has taken a massive shift in initiative over the past decade, and if we fail to reinvigorate the party to stand with President Kirkpatrick in her quest to protect the American Shield of Democracy, then everything we have built up to this point shall crumble and fall as well. Segregationists of old, Reformists of new, and American Conservatives of now must band together behind the Star Spangled Banner, for it is the Far Right of the National Progressive Party that upholds the light of patriotism against the darkness of Fascists and Imperialists abroad. Besides, organizing the party will allow us to reign in all of the weak-willed, rubber-spined bureaucrats in the party who keep getting shoved around by the likes of the Republican-Democrats, while taking hold of our more liberal-minded brethren across the wings of the National Progressive Party as well."

 USA_kirk_72_restore_war_powers_desc:0 "Some people in this country who lack the guts to stand up for it have criticized actions of Presidents past in utilizing our brave troops on air, land, and sea to protect our interests around the world. Those people are the same ones we have to thank for allowing Adolf Hitler's bootprint to be stamped across all of Europe, and allowed Hideki Tojo to cleave the American Spirit in twain across the Pacific. Now, we have to focus on a greater future, one where we won't even give the enemy the chance to subvert our power across the world. A future illuminated by the Beacon of Democracy.\n\nHowever, to do this, we'll have to take some grand steps in terms of legislation, and knock a few pegs down from the "checks and balances" that are preventing the Kirkpatrick Administration from fully protecting the interests of America. In particular, the War Powers Resolution has put a stranglehold against the President's ability to act quickly and effectively, requiring a full forty-eight hours of alert to Congress in advance, with full ability to get shot down by those bureaucratic bastards, and a strict time limit on the length of our intervention. Thus, we need to tear this Act out of the legal system, so we may act as the sword and shield of the American Spirit across the world."

 USA_kirk_72_make_the_call_desc:0 "The gunpowder has been laid, the machine guns have been entrenched, the operatives have trained their militias, and the people's voices are in the air. All that it will take for Balaguer's Fascist-minded government to crash and burn now is a spark. And America, oh beautiful, for spacious skies, is a matchbox filled to the brim.\n\nIt may stand true that the revolutionaries of the Dominican Republic may walk from all different paths of life. Businessmen, market salesmen, soldiers, politicians, and more. However, while some of them may have the chance to bicker and squabble, none of that matters now that the revolution is prepared. The guns are loaded, the people are rallied, and the leadership has a new face. It is our duty, now more than ever, to secure America's safety by bringing down the network of Fascist influences in the Carribean, and Balaguer's spider-web will be the first to burn against the flame of the Beacon of Liberty."

 KIRK.1.t:0 "Too Soft"
 KIRK.1.desc:0 "President Jeane Kirkpatrick felt the smooth surface of the Resolute Desk for what felt like the hundredth time. She was here, and it was hers, and that seemed an impossible, extraordinary fact. A manila folder lay on the desk, and she rapped her fingers on the smooth, varnished wood, patiently awaiting a discussion of the folder's contents.\n\nA short rap came at the door, and her new Secretary of State, Walt Rostow, marched in without invitation. "Madam President, I understand you wanted to speak with me regarding assignments and removals in the State Department."\n\nShe handed Rostow the folder, and he flipped through it slowly. "Madam President, these are some of the most capable diplomats the State Department has, and you want me to sideline or fire them? Men like Jack Vaughn are-"\n\n"-Too soft."\n\n"I beg your pardon? Surely you can't be serious."\n\n"Mr. Rostow, I am not in the habit of making jokes on affairs of state. These individuals need to be replaced. I have a list of suitable candidates for each position. The details may be determined at your discretion."\n\n"I'd rather not remove so many, especially not ones who are so capable."\n\n"Mr. Secretary, in the coming weeks you will either remove these individuals, or join their number. You may fall in line or step aside, but you will not stand in my way."\n\nRostow grimaced slightly, but nodded, and left the Oval Office without a word. President Kirkpatrick returned to feeling the smooth varnish of the Resolute Desk, awaiting yet more meetings scheduled today."
 KIRK.1.a:0 "All according to plan."
 
 KIRK.2.t:0 "And Ye Shall Know the Truth..."
 KIRK.2.desc:0 "The meeting with James Angleton, the new director of the CIA, had gone very well. Of course, President Jeane Kirkpatrick didn't think it could have possibly gone poorly, but it was better than expected. Together, they had laid out the plans for the expansion of the agency's budget, as well as the "realignment" of the agency towards anti-fascism. Regime changes in several disagreeable governments throughout Latin America were beginning to take shape.\n\n"Well, Madam President," said Angleton, "most of the plans for your 'Kirkpatrick Doctrine' are being set in place."\n\n"I take objection to that name. It's a product of many people's pragmatism, not exclusively my own."\n\n"Regardless, I think it's best that we move on to domestic matters. The agency has identified many potential threats to the United States government, such as the Black Panthers, that it may be prudent to keep tabs on."\n\nKirkpatrick leaned forward on the Resolute Desk. "And what do you recommend we do about these... threats?"\n\nAngleton pulled a manila folder out of his blazer and slid it across to the President. She opened it, finding pages upon pages of names. Gus Hall, Angela Davis, Francis Yockey, and dozens of others. Next to each name was a word or phrase in blocked red ink: MONITOR, COUNTERACT, SUBMIT FOR ARREST, or SUBMIT FOR TERMINATION.\n\nKirkpatrick looked back to Angleton, astonished. "What's this?""
 KIRK.2.a:0 ""Chaos.""
 
 KIRK.3.t:0 "The Winds of Change"
 KIRK.3.desc:0 "Secretary of Defense John McCain Jr. looked puzzled by what his associates, Walt Rostow and Jeane Kirkpatrick, were discussing. Their meeting in the Oval Office had begun in earnest, but so far all they had talked about was the Dominican Republic and how important it was to protect American interests overseas. "So," he began, "you plan on completely overthrowing the government of the Dominican Republic without having a single American soldier involved?"\n\nKirkpatrick nodded, and McCain became even more puzzled. "Then why am I here?"\n\n"Secretary McCain, the Western Hemisphere occasionally requires a deft touch, and occasionally a less-than-deft touch. The plans set forth by the Central Intelligence Agency are not in conflict with those of the Department of Defense; rather, they require them. These regime changes need to happen, and the Agency will get them done, but the United States military will ensure that these new regimes remain loyal."\n\n"Like Guyana?"\n\n"Like Guyana," said Rostow. "Most of the regimes throughout Latin America are less-than-friendly to American interests, and far too friendly to those of our enemies. The Dominican Republic is a domino that might fall over if given just one small... push. We need to make sure it falls on our side. Once that's done, the muscle of the American military will be a good motivator for them to stay on our side.""
 KIRK.3.a:0 "The pieces fall into place."
 
 KIRK.4.t:0 "A Castillo of Our Own"
 KIRK.4.desc:0 "CIA Director James Angleton stepped into Secretary of State Walt Rostow's office with some purpose. He tossed a manila folder onto Rostow's desk. "So," he began, "the President wants the Dominican President ousted by this man?"\n\n"Vincho Castillo," replied Rostow, puffing up a cigarette, "Dominican lawyer, political figure, and leader of the opposition. It's a good thing, too; Caudillo Joaquin Balguer is a bit of a fascist strongman."\n\n"And Castillo isn't?"\n\nRostow smiled. "Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but he's better than the alternative. In any case, how have your preparations for his coup gone?"\n\n"Well, after making a few calls, a few bribes, and a few friends, I'd say our friend in Hispanola has his chessboard set. He's got a few thousand CIA-armed militiamen at his back."\n\n"And the Dominican army?"\n\n"We're looking into that. Word in Langley is the commander of the Santo Domingo garrison might take a 'donation' over a paycheck."\n\n"Well then, what are we waiting for?""
 KIRK.4.a:0 "All that remains is the order."
 
 KIRK.5.t:0 "Long Dark of Langley"
 KIRK.5.desc:0 "President Jeane Kirkpatrick, Secretary of State Walt Rostow, Secretary of Defense John McCain Jr., and CIA Director James Angleton sat around a map of the Dominican Republic, the stench of tobacco smoke filling the dank meeting room. Angleton pointed at various blue markers that dotted the map of the island nation. "Several police departments in Santo Domingo and Santiago de los Caballeros have quietly expressed support for Castillo's movement. When his forces, now numbering around 8,000 men, move out of the jungles, they'll seize the largest cities without too much internal resistance. The general currently guarding Santo Domingo has said he won't have his men interfere, either."\n\n"How much did that cost us?" asked the President.\n\n"Not too much," said McCain, "I figure most of the Dominican military can see the writing on the wall."\n\nAway from the cameras of the press corps, Jeane Kirkpatrick took a long drag on her cigarette. "American interests come first," she said coldly, "we do things to protect those whom we love, that which we hold dear: America."\n\nShe tapped out the ash and laid the smoke onto a tray. She looked at Angleton."
 KIRK.5.a:0 ""Make the call.""
 
 KIRK.6.t:0 "Kirkpatrick's War Powers Act Fails!"
 KIRK.6.desc:0 "Today, after more than a month of political argumenting and compromising, it seems that all was for naught, as President Jeane Kirkpatrick's War Powers Resolution failed to gather enough votes in the Senate. The act, doggedly pursued by the Kirkpatrick Administration, would have allowed the President to send American troops overseas for extended periods of time without the approval of Congress or a declaration of national emergency. It also empowers the President to, under times of war, imprison "individuals suspected of foreign allegiance" without trial. What exactly this nebulous term would have meant in fact, however, is a matter of great debate.\n\nWith a defeat of her plans in Congress, President Kirkpatrick's foreign policy plan seems to have been slowed, at least for now. While the President herself has yet to comment on the bill's failure, the White House Press Secretary said that "things would be moving forward as planned". The Kirkpatrick Doctrine, it seems, will not be stopped so easily."
 KIRK.6.a:0 "Damn!"
 
 KIRK.7.t:0 "Kirkpatrick's War Powers Act Passes!"
 KIRK.7.desc:0 "Today, after more than a month of bribes, arguments, and compromises, President Jeane Kirkpatrick's War Powers Resolution was passed with a majority of votes in the Senate. The act, doggedly pursued by the Kirkpatrick Administration, allows the President to send American troops overseas for extended periods of time without the approval of Congress or a declaration of national emergency. It also empowers the President to, under times of war, imprison "individuals suspected of foreign allegiance" without trial. What exactly this nebulous clause means, and how it will be implemented going forward, remains a matter of quite some debate.\n\nWhile many of the left-leaning political figures in America blow the whistle of "tyrant!", the Kirkpatrick Administration's foreign policy plans are quickly spurring into motion. The new powers invested in the President and her staff have not only given her a chance to exert her will by force, if necessary; they have also given her a great boost to her political confidence. When the next bill comes, it may not be so veiled in flowers and smiles."
 KIRK.7.a:0 "Our work can begin..."
 
 KIRK.8.t:0 "Dreams of White Sands"
 KIRK.8.desc:0 "CIA Director James Angleton stepped into the office of his Deputy, Vernon Walters, placing a few thick folders onto the man's desk. He was staring idly at a picture of a house next to an absurdly white beach that seemed to go on for eternity. "Morning, Walters," said Angleton, "are you already wanting to head back down to Florida?"\n\n"Morning, boss," Walters said, "I'm just reminiscing. What's all this?"\n\n"Personnel reassignments to Operation CHAOS. More than 1,000 agents and employees are to be allocated. I expect them all to receive their new assignment by month's end. There are also details for first moves, individuals of interest, and so on."\n\nWalters flipped through the files and furrowed his brow. "I didn't know you had gotten approval for the operation to be on such a large scale. This is... extreme. We're assigning almost 5% of our personnel to illegally spying on the American public."\n\n"Illegal? Don't be so dramatic. We're just bending the rules a little. I've got a lot to do, so I'll leave you to it, but if you're so bothered by it, you can go back to Florida. There's already a home waiting for you."\n\nAngleton left the office before Walters could reply. He looked down at the papers and sighed, a pit forming in his stomach. He glanced back up at the picture of the beach with the little summer house, the gentle swelling waves of the ocean rippling in the distance. "Maybe I will," he said to no one in particular."
 KIRK.8.a:0 "Operation CHAOS is proceeding."
 
 KIRK.9.t:0 "The American Way"
 KIRK.9.desc:0 "Vice President Sam Yorty stepped into the office of his superior, Jeane Kirkpatrick, admiring the Oval Office. "Ah, good to see you, Sam," said Kirkpatrick with a smile, "I have something I want to discuss with you."\n\n"Oh?"\n\n"As you know, I don't make my choices of allies lightly, and there was a reason I chose you as my running mate."\n\nYorty raised an eyebrow. "You're choosing to inform me of this now? After we've already won and been inaugurated."\n\n"I was under the impression that one won an election before beginning the administrative duties of the office. I hope you don't need a lesson? Regardless, as you know, you're a very... shall we say colorful individual in American politics. Some people hate you, but many love you."\n\n"Your point being?"\n\n"My point being that no matter what you say, people are going to listen to it for the hell of it. You're entertaining, in short. So, when I say that you're going to be the lynchpin of garnering support for foreign intervention here in the homeland, I mean it."\n\nYorty smiled, knowing his job just became a whole lot more important."
 KIRK.9.a:0 ""Thank you, madam president.""
 
 KIRK.100.t:0 "Priceless Old Junk"
 KIRK.100.desc:0 "With a final tug on the crowbar from a Dominican guerilla, the side of the wooden crate flung open, revealing its contents. A dozen old M1 carbine rifles, haphazardly stacked atop one another. Agent David Atlee Phillips handed one of the worn old weapons over to the Dominican in cheap army fatigues that hovered beside him. "Start handing these out to your unit," he said in slightly-accented Spanish.\n\nSo many of these obsolescent guns had shown up today in a shipment from Miami. Cracking them all open had been backbreaking work, but luckily not work that Phillips had to do himself. A few yards away, they broke open yet another crate, this time filled with old tommy guns. The guerillas handed them around, pantomiming gangsters mowing down vast numbers of people.\n\nBehind him, a voice caught his attention. "Do you think all this will be enough?"\n\nHe turned to face his fellow agent, Michael Townley. "I don't think it will need to be," he said, "but its more guns in a country that's already got too many. I think we're just feeding chaos here."\n\n"Maybe. For now, let them enjoy their priceless old junk.""
 KIRK.100.a:0 "Hopefully they'll have no trouble with it."

 KIRK.101.t:0 "Cafe en la Plaza"
 KIRK.101.desc:0 "Rodrigo Luciano Biel Jurado sat in silence outside of the Cafe Luis in Santo Domingo, a few blocks away from the National Palace. Taking inconspicuous sips from his espresso, he analyzed the approaching soldiers with glancing looks from his notebook. In it, he wrote: "Soldiers of the Dominican Army, unit unknown at this time. Patrol along Av Simon Bolivar. Circuit once every 20 minutes. Number: 20 men on patrol."\n\nThe man leading the formation got a look at Rodrigo and stopped his formation's march, a stern look on his face. "You!" he yelled. "You have been at this cafe all day, why?"\n\nRodrigo raised an eyebrow. "I like the coffee here," he replied, "is that a crime, sir?"\n\nThe few people who were sitting around outside the Cafe Luis were now staring at Rodrigo. He sighed and pulled a badge out of his pocket, identifying him as a member of Dominican Intelligence. The officer was taken aback. "What is your name?" asked Rodrigo.\n\n"...Lieutenant Alfonso Ramon Jimenez."\n\nRodrigo made a note in his book. "Well, Lieutenant Jimenez, I must get back to my superiors. Thank you for your cooperation and... good formation."\n\nA look of horror went over the Lieutenant's face as Rodrigo sauntered away. Luckily for him, Rodrigo was going to be reporting to a very different set of superiors than he let on."
 KIRK.101.a:0 "Somewhat useful intel, at least."
