wallace.impeachment.1.t:0 "가장 어두운 시간"
wallace.impeachment.1.desc:0 "월레스 정부의 학교 인종분리 법안을 시행하기 위해 리틀록에 배치된 연방군은 오늘 아침 모든 아프리카계 미국인 학생들을 추방하는 조치에 항의하기 위해 리틀록 센트럴 고등학교로 행진하는 시위대에 총격을 가했습니다. 이번 사태는 시위 반대 세력이 시위대 측이 학교에 접근하지 못하게 막고 연방군이 두 집단을 분리하려 시도하면서 발생했습니다. 현지 병원은 흑인 시위대 14명이 사망하고 36명이 부상당했으며 백인 시위대의 입원에 대한 보고는 없었다고 전했습니다. \n\n미 국방부 관리들은 오늘 사건에 대한 언급을 회피하면서, 관련 병사들이 '점점 더 폭력적인 상황에 대응하여 적절한 자제력을 행사했다'고만 말했습니다. 전미 유색인 지위 향상 협회는 이번 사건이 '눈치를 주면서 정의와 질서의 이름으로 부당한 차별을 가하는 정부에 의한 야만이 최근 들어난 것'이라고 주장하며 연방군의 행동을 비난했습니다.\n\n현지 당국이 즉각 통행금지를 선언한 뒤 리틀록에서는 산발적인 폭력사태만 보고되었지만 뉴욕, 디트로이트, 보스턴, 버밍엄, 시카고, 볼티모어 등에서 이번 사건의 파장이 급속히 확산되면서 시위와 약탈이 잇따랐으며, 시위 지도자들은 연방군에게 내려진 명령에 대한 즉각적인 조사를 요구하고 있습니다. 워싱턴의 민주공화당 고위 관계자들과 국가진보당 중도파 이익단체는 앞으로 수일 내에 국방부와 백악관에 즉각적인 해명을 요구하겠다는 성명을 발표했습니다."

wallace.impeachment.2.desc:0 ""...야간 폭동 진압 때문에 주 경찰의 피로도가 극심해지고 있는 가운데, 매일 주 의회 밖에 모여드는 시위대에 대한 응답으로 아칸소 주지사는 리틀록 사건 당시 연방군의 행동에 대해 주 정부가 자체 조사를 실시할 것이라고 발표했습니다. 주지사는 성명에서 월레스 행정부의 연방군 투입 결정에 대해 공개적으로 의문을 제기하며, 불분명한 명령과 현지 관행에 익숙하지 않은 것이 이번 사태로 이어졌다고 비난했습니다."\n\n보좌관들은 대통령의 얼굴이 일그러지는 동안 서로 시선을 나누었습니다. 비서실장이 TV를 끄자 대통령은 즉각 주의를 돌렸습니다.\n\n"대통령님, 이게 얼마나 좋지 않은 상황인지 아시지 않습니까. 의회와 아칸소 주가... 부적절한 결론을 내리기 전에 우리는 연방 수사를 개시하여 이 문제를 극복해야 합니다."\n\n월레스는 천천히 고개를 끄덕였습니다. 거리에서 미군 병사들이 다른 미국인을 쏘는 광경은 무시하기에는 너무 끔찍했고, 그는 하이에나들이 자신 가까이에서 돌고 있다는 것을 알았습니다. 이제 중요한 건 피해 통제뿐이고 아칸소 주 정부가 증거 수집을 시작하기 전에 연방정부가 조사를 맡도록 하는 것입니다. 월레스는 이 모든 혼란이 시작되기 전에 주지사에게 전화를 했습니다..."

wallace.impeachment.3.desc:0 "하루 뒤, 정부는 국방부가 리틀록에서의 발포에 대한 조사를 맡게 될 것이라고 발표하였지만, 월레스는 비서실장이 의사당에서 열린 회의에서 돌아오기를 초조하게 기다리고 있었습니다. 화가 난 의회 지도자들이 시간을 끌며 리틀록 사건을 들쑤시고 있는게 분명했습니다. 하지만 국가진보당이 대열을 이탈하지 않는 한, 군과 법무부가 아칸소 주에서 모든 증거를 확보하기만 하면 괜찮을 것입니다. -\n\n비서실장은 숨을 가쁘게 쉬며 대통령 집무실로 뛰어왔습니다. 그는 당황한 모습으로 더듬거리는 소리를 간신히 참았습니다. "의회는 주지사와의 통화 기록을 가지고 있습니다. 우리 쪽에서 증거를 확보하기도 전에 우릴 팔아넘겼습니다." \n\n월레스는 비틀거렸습니다.  "그럼 의회는 어떻지?"\n\n"총격이 있기 전에 연방군의 임무에 대해 제대로 상의하거나 통보받지 못했다는 주지사의 말에 쏠리고 있습니다." 월레스는 비서실장에게 물을 권했지만, 그는 거절하고 계속 말했습니다. "중도파는 하원에서 조사에 동의할 것입니다. 상황이 더이상 감당할 수 없게 되어가고 있습니다. 어느 시점에 가서 증언을 요청받을 것입니다."\n\n월레스는 욕을 내뱉었습니다. 의회의 하이에나들이 피 냄새를 맡았고, 이렇게 되면 모든 것이 더 복잡해질 것입니다. 이제는 이 논쟁을 국민에게 직접 공개해야 할 지도 모릅니다."

"상황이 진정되지 않습니다, 대통령님. 국가진보당이 우리를 따라오지 않을 것입니다." \n\n월레스는 비서실장을 바라보았습니다.  "더 좋은 계획 있나? 4시간 안에 성명서를 다시 쓸 순 없네!"\n\n비서실장은 대통령에게 간청했습니다.  "그렇지만 몇 가지 사실을 더 자세히 설명할 시간은 있습니다. 조금만 더 버틸 수 있다면 아마도 그날 시위대와 반대 시위대의 폭력으로 인해 군대가 위협을 느꼈다는 우리의 주장을 뒷받침할 수 있는 무언가를 찾을 수 있을 것입니다. 우리 주장을 더욱 설득력 있게 만들고 양쪽 모두 잘못이 있는 것처럼 보이게 할 수 있는 충분한 사실들을 말입니다.""

wallace.impeachment.6.desc:0 "이따금씩 카메라 플래시가 터지는 소리, 1~2분마다 속삭이는 소리, 어색한 기침이나 목청을 가다듬는 소리, 대통령이 연설문을 훑어보기 위해 종이를 뒤적이는 소리. 미국 전역의 미국인들이 겪었던 끔찍한 날에 이어 아침에 대통령 집무실에서 들리는 유일한 소음들이었습니다. 이제 시민들, 정치인들, 그리고 심지어 각료들까지도 리틀록에서의 사건들과 관련하여 대통령에게 질문, 아니, 답변을 요구하고 있습니다. "대통령님, 이제 생방송 시작입니다. 3, 2, 1..." \n\n"좋은 아침입니다. 사랑하는 미국인 여러분. 지난 하루는 공포, 분노, 슬픔의 감정으로 가득했습니다. 어제 아침 리틀록 센트럴 고등학교가 개학식을 위해 문을 열자 퇴학당한 아프리카계 미국인 학생들이 문을 향해 열을 지어 행진하기 시작했습니다. 이들이 행진을 하다 이들의 입학을 저지하려는 반대 시위대로부터 거센 저항에 부딪혀 연방군 병사들이 사태 진정을 시도했습니다. 긴장이 고조되고 폭력이 거세지자 그들은 법과 질서를 유지하기 위해 끔찍한 결정을 내려야 했으며, 폭력 시위자를 해산시키기 위해 학생 쪽에 발포를 했습니다. 그 지역을 지키라는 명령을 받은 군인들이 집계한 결과,  총 14명이 사망하고 36명이 부상당했음이 밝혀졌습니다. 신사 숙녀 여러분, 여러분이 누구이건 간에, 이것은 부끄러운 비극입니다. 우리 행정부는 이 사건의 본질과 주변을 조사하기 위해 열심히 노력하고 있습니다. 어떤 학생이 총알에 맞아 숨진 일은 현대사회에서 없애야 할 테러이며, 이 나라가 지금처럼 큰 고통을 당해야 한다는 것은 안타까운 일입니다. 여러분 모두 단결해 주시고, 위기의 시기에 강건하게 서주시길 바랍니다. 폭동을 일으키지 마십시오. 오히려 우리와 함께 서십시오. 우리는 정의를 위해 최선을 다할 것입니다. 나라를 위해, 가족을 위해, 당을 위해, 자유와 정의를 위해, 그리고 모두를 위해." \n\n카메라의 섬광은 계속해서 대통령을 괴롭혔지만, 매몰스럽게 행동하는 것은 이 상황을 더 악화시킬 뿐입니다. '그래 그렇게 계속 사진 찍어라. 찍다보면 조지 C. 월레스가 고통을 같이 하고 있다는 것도 알게 되겠지.' 대통령은 생각했습니다."

wallace.impeachment.7.desc:0 "의회의 탄핵 조사가 단순한 진상규명이 아닌 것으로 밝혀졌습니다. 소환장의 힘으로 무장한 입법자들은 증인이나 공직자들에게 광범위한 주제에 대해 문서를 내놓거나 선서 증언을 하도록 강요할 수 있으며, 이를 거부한 - 또는 거짓을 말한 - 자는 형사 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다. 이러한 점을 염두에 둔 하원 정부감시 위원회는 지상의 군인에서 백악관 공직자들의 사생활, 행정부의 가장 민감한 결정에 이르기까지 리틀록 대학살로 이어지는 결정에 관련된 광범위한 증인들을 요청하였습니다. \n\n월레스는 하원 조사관들이 제공한 증인 명단과 그 근거를 휙휙 넘겨보았습니다. 이 명단은 공격적인 일정표 위에 놓인 광범위한 목록입니다. 월레스는 소환된 두 집단, 지상군 병사들이나 명령을 내리는 데 일조한 공직자들, 중 한 집단과만 입을 맞출 수 있다고 암울하게 중얼거렸습니다. \n\n그리고 물론, 위원회에는 국가진보당 입법자들이 조사를 얼마나 부드럽게 할 것이냐는 문제가 있습니다. 국가진보당 중도파가 반란을 일으키기 직전인 상황에서 이것 역시 쉬운 일은 아닐 것입니다. 하지만 당원들에게 기대는 것이 목격자에게 지시하는 것보다 더 맞지 않을까요?"

wallace.impeachment.8.desc:0 "리틀록에 배치된 군인들의 증언에 끊임없는 밑바탕이 되는 것은 모호함과 혼란입니다. \n\n군인들은 '법을 지키고 질서를 지키라'는 모호한 명령 아래 아프리카계 미국인 시위대와 백인 반대 시위자들 사이에 얇은 경계선을 형성하면서 생긴 혼란스러운 분위기를 묘사했습니다. \n\n난투극이 벌어져 긴장감을 흐르는 가운데, 중간에 끼인 장병들이 두 무리를 갈라놓으려 애쓰는 모습이 포착됐다. 균열이 생겼다. 장전이 돼있던가? 전우와 하릴없이 시선을 주고 받자, 다시 한번 균열이 가며 비명이 울려퍼졌다. 군중이 밀려왔다. 사격 준비. 조준할 시간이 없습니다. 그냥 중간에 쏩니까? \n\n이 모든 것은 그저 끔찍한 사고처럼 들리고, 우리는 혼란과 모호함이 탄핵의도에 대한 어떤 추정도 우습게 만든다고 주장할 수 있습니다. 그렇기는 하지만 사망자 모두가 흑인 시위대라는 사실에는 변함이 없으며, 확실한 모호성이 없다는 점에 비추어 볼 때, 이는 믿을 만한 논리방어가 되지 못할 수도 있습니다. 실제로 우리는 이 모호한 명령이 인종분리 '법안'을 지지하고 책임을 회피하려는 깡패들의 술수에 불과하다는 비난에 직면하게 될 것입니다.\n\n어쨌든 병사들은 명시적으로 무력 사용 허가가 내려진 것이 아니라 자의적인 판단에 따라 그렇게 하였다는 것에 동의하였습니다.  물론 우리는 곤경에서 벗어난 대가로 비난의 폭풍에 휩싸일 것입니다. 군인들에게 이런 식으로 증언하도록 하는 '인센티브'를 준비하는 것은 비용이 많이 들고 비윤리적일 뿐더러, 정치적 희생양이 된 국방부가 어떤 영향을 받을 지는 불 보듯 뻔한 일입니다."

"그들은 '흑인들을 들판으로 돌려보내라'와 같은 소리를 지르면서 우리가 그 학교로 들어가는 것을 원치 않았습니다. 결국, 싸움이 번졌고, 우리가 행진하는 동안, 제 동료 학생들 중 몇 명이 주먹에 맞고, 발로 차이고, 때로는 머리를 벽돌로 맞기도 했습니다. 그리고 그때," 퍼시는 여기서 잠깐 쉬었습니다. 그는 말하기도 전에 목소리는 갈라지고 목이 메었습니다. "그때 군대가 왔습니다. 그들이 와서 모두를 때렸습니다. 그들 중 몇몇은 우리처럼 혼란스럽고 겁먹은 것처럼 보였지만, 또 몇몇은 우리를 미워하는 것처럼 보였습니다. 그들은 우리를 밀고 나간 후에 발포했습니다." 퍼시는 눈물을 흘린 후 몇 분 동안 마음을 추스렸습니다. \n\n수도에서의 상황이 새로운 국면에 접어들면서 소식이 점점 더 멀리 퍼져나가고 있습니다. 더 많은 학생들이 희생자의 편을 들어주며 상황이 계속 전개되고 있는 가운데, 이 모든 것이 끝나고 나면 월레스 대통령에게 어떤 결과가 나올지는 시간만이 알 것입니다."

"아칸소 주에 있는 제216 헌병중대의 2소대는 아칸소 주와 미국 남부에서 교육 분리와 관련하여 연방법을 시행하라는 명령을 받았습니다." 리틀록 센트럴 고등학교에 주둔하고 있었던 부대의 지휘관 빅터 손튼 중위가 말했습니다. "그 후에 일어난 사건들은 혼란에 빠진 상황을 통제하기 위해 시도한 것입니다." 많은 의원들은 리틀록에서의 행동에 대해 지휘관이 승인했다는 것처럼 들리는 이 증언을 듣고 숨이 막혔습니다. 하지만 또 다른 부대원인 더글라스 N. 맥코넬 상병은 "저는 다른 몇몇 부대원들 사이에 서 있었습니다. 저는 바깥의 시위자들과 마찬가지로 죽을 만큼 무서웠습니다. 주먹이 날라가고, 사람들은 이를 갈면서 비명을 질렀습니다. 날아가는 벽돌 하나에 실명될 뻔 했다고 맹세할 수 있습니다." 라고 하며 눈에 띄게 다른 증언을 했습니다. "모든 것이 너무 빨리 진행되었고, 병사들과 장교들은 똑같이 소리를 질렀습니다. 결국 누군가가 '사격개시!'라고 소리쳤고, 모든 것이 끝났습니다.' 그는 눈물을 흘리며 갈라진 목소리를 말했습니다. "마치 지옥 같았습니다. 모두가 총을 쏘기 시작했습니다. 너무 무서워서 방아쇠에 손가락을 대는 것조차 느낄 수 없었고, 그 뒤에야 비로소 발사를 하지 않았다는 것을 알았습니다." 병사는 눈물을 흘리며 말을 마쳤습니다. \n\n워싱턴은 지금 공포에 빠져있습니다. 하지만 정부는 무슨 일이 있어도 책임자들이 리틀록 센트럴 고등학교에서 행동에 대해 대가를 치를 것이고, 모든 희생자들이 보상받을 수 있도록 할 것이라고 약속했습니다."

"공공안정부는 리틀록 센트럴 고등학교에서 발생한 유혈사태의 원인을 인정하고 그날 행동에 매우 큰 유감을 느끼고 있습니다." 장관이 말했습니다.

"네. 대통령님이나, 행정기관, 입법기관의 방침은 그날 제 결정에 전혀 영향을 미치지 않았습니다. 저는 단지 아칸소 주 방위군의 상급 장교들이 제게 내린 명령에 따라 행동했을 뿐입니다." 중위가 응답했습니다. 이로써 피청구인 측이 제시한 증인신문은 끝이 났고, 명백한 승소인 것처럼 보였습니다. \n\n하지만, 무언가 이상했습니다. 월레스는 눈으로는 법정에서 명백히 승리한 것처럼 보이는 데 비해 무언가가 자신을 찌르는 듯한 고통스러운 느낌이 등줄기를 기어오르는 것을 계속 느꼈습니다. 그때 그는 눈을 알아차렸습니다. 바로 그겁니다. 상원 의회에서 피청구인측을 내려다보고 있는 백 명의 눈은 대통령의 생각에 좋은 징조가 되지 않았습니다. 하지만 그게 뭘까요? 월레스는 무엇이 옳지 않은지 알아내기 위해 지난날의 사건들을 생각했습니다. 사도스키가 책상으로 다시 다가가자, 월레스는 갑자기 무서운 깨달음을 얻었습니다. 상원의 침묵 속에서 사도스키 박사를 끌어당긴 그는 주변 '재판관'들의 반응에 불만과 걱정 비슷한 표정을 눈치챘습니다. 두 사람은 이론과 가설을 논의하다가 월레스는 깊은 생각에 잠기게 되었습니다. "공무원들은요 박사님?" "무슨 소리입니까, 공무원들이 뭐 어떻다는 거죠?" 사도스키 박사가 행동했습니다. "생각해봅시다. 공무원들은 우리 정부가 그 빌어먹을 총격사건과 아무 관련 없다는 걸 보여주려고 그 이상의 일을 해냈고 이제 이 사람이 모든 것을 털어놓았죠. 마치 모든 것이 잘 되어가고, 멋져 보이는 것처럼요. 그들이 의심스러워 한다면요, 박사님?" \n\n두 남자는 끊임없는 눈빛이 그들을 뒤덮는 것을 느꼈고, 삶에서 가장 스트레스를 많이 받는 날이 될 수도 있다는 것에 엄청난 압박감을 받았습니다."

wallace.433.desc:0 "It is just as we feared. As the Senate sat down to begin the final debates and vote on the PFTA, one R-D senator skipped up to the stand with a determined twinkle in his eye. He began to speak - and continued to speak - and would not stop speaking for a very, very long time.\n\n"My fellow senators. This is a very important day for our country, no doubt. But before we hold this critical vote, I believe we need to discuss what really matters. I come before you today to speak about a subject very dear to my heart..."\n\nIt became immediately clear that this was indeed a filibuster. Rather than focus on the matter at hand, the senator began a lengthy reading of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, his favorite book from his youth. Despite the ridiculousness of the situation, filibuster is of course a protected practice. His voice was clear and driven, and at no point did he falter, leave for the bathroom or do anything that could bring the filibuster to an end. Even worse, lain out in front of him was a myriad of other reading material - it was clear that he was in this for the long haul.\n\nAside from giving in to the filibuster, we have two main courses of action. We could attempt to call a cloture vote - a vote to end the filibuster and immediately ratify the agreement. However, this requires us to secure a two-thirds majority. As time goes on, more and more people will be eager to see this filibuster come to a close, so an alternative is to wait it out until we can be sure we have enough support for a cloture vote to pass."

While this is not the final victory and the actual vote still needs to be secured, that the Senate agreed to the fastrack may serve as a positive indicator to the chances for the bill itself."

While this does not spell the end for the bill, it means that it will now continue to be debated by Congress, with the potential for a long lasting argument or the addition of amendments that may modify or dilute its intended purpose.\n\nPresident Wallace is reportedly furious at the news, knowing that many of his rivals in Congress would love nothing more than to see one of his crowning achievements strangled in the cot. Indeed, there are a few of these antagonistic individuals who will likely stop at nothing to prevent the bill's passing, utilizing everything in the rulebook including that time-old American tradition - the fillibuster."

How do we possibly move on from this? How can this possibly be anything other than a colossal failure for my presidency?"\n\nThe Perth Free Trade Agreement was delivered its sentence today, as the Senate finally dismissed the proposal. With the Bloc dead in the water, the delegations of the other nations have already begun leaving Perth to return home, quietly cursing the wasted effort. President Wallace has not been seen in public since the defeat, as he seethes over the tarnishing of his economic magnum opus.\n\nMuch of the opposition to the bill came from within the NPP, with much of the Center and even some of the more protectionist Right coming out to cast their votes against it. In the eyes of the voters, the failure of the NPP to come together to pass a measure that was already widely unpopular amongst a large amount of the general public has only further exposed the fractures in the party. The optics of this defeat for the NPP are certainly grave indeed.""
bill_5_passed:0 "At long last, after many weeks of negotiations, backroom deals and bitter arguments, the Senate today formally approved the Perth Free Trade Agreement, which was promptly signed into law by President Wallace. In Perth itself, the delegations present were finally able to ratify the Perth Bloc into an official institution of free trade across the Pacific and beyond.\n\nIt will take some time for the effects of the free trade zone to be felt. Major international corporations are currently in feverish talks with foreign governments and businesses to organize deals and expansion into overseas markets. There are already some promising signs, however, with the Dollar surging on the stock exchange as the markets respond positively to this historic development. The opportunities now open to American business are vast, and many business executives are currently occupying themselves with champagne and celebrations.\n\nAmerica is sure to gain much influence over the Pacific from the agreement, which will surely help beat back the grip of the Rising Sun. Though many of our voters are still leery over the impact of the PFTA, they will surely see the benefits soon. This is a great day for American business, and for the National Progressive Party."

From the very impetus of her campaign for president, Smith has openly advertised herself as "pro-business"- a political position destined to gain wide traction in terms of monetary support, no doubt. However, the presidency itself comes with caveats, one of which is that campaign promises are often only half-fulfilled. \n\nThe C-NPP, the general progressive party of the United States, begrudgingly supported Smith during her presidential campaign, and now expects her to support their pro-laborer demands. Under their leadership, and with the support of the Smith Administration, the C-NPP could unravel the President's business support, killing her chances at re-election.

Consequently, economic progressivism has seen a massive resurgence in the C-NPP and other groups, and they have become so vocal about their rhetoric that they are now impossible to ignore.\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith is famously pro-employer, but should she wish to pass some of her legislation, she must gain the support of the C-NPP. As outright pushing for pro-employee policies is out of the question, the President believes that better relations between businesses and laborers is the most effective and prudent solution to the problem. With the empowerment of the National Labor Relations Board, the employer-employee system may see improvement."

In almost 200 years of existence, the economy has been seldom worse. More than 20% of Americans live in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau; the nation's GDP has seen stagnant growth since the end of the Second World War, far less than would be expected; hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans lack access to basic necessities, such as clean drinking water. All-in-all, the United States of America is in bad shape.\n\nLuckily for the States, however, it has a president and congress who mostly recognize the issue, and are willing to do anything to put an end to it. While President Margaret Chase Smith wants most Americans to have access to welfare programs that would allow the poor and infirm to get back on their feet, she also knows that the federal budget could not allow for massive expansion of welfare. As such, the President and her allies in Congress will attempt to push through a new federal budget to cut back on wasteful projects and allocate the excess funding to a new welfare program; one that would primarily assist those who cannot assist themselves."
USA_mcs_68_maternity_leave:0 "Maternity Leave"
USA_mcs_68_maternity_leave_desc:0 "One of the most important things for an infant is the familial connection: the bond formed with the father and mother. Yet, for decades, women have been refused leave from work to care for their child following birth. For such a crucial time in infantile development, precious little attention is given to it by the law. While it is true that some employers will allow new mothers to take perhaps a few unpaid days or weeks off work to care for their child, many do not. Consequently, many new moms are either forced to leave their children at home with a babysitter while they work- an increasingly expensive proposition- or take their infants to work with them, where they put immense stress on their mothers.\n\nAs most politicians are male, relatively few are more aware of this problem than President Margaret Chase Smith. She knows better than most that women not only deserve maternity leave, but require it. Raising a new generation is neither easy nor cheap, and thus, the President will press state legislatures to pass laws that mandate maternity leave, preferably of the paid variety."

For decades, blue collar workers have been crying out for it, and for decades, employees have been fired for attempting to start or joining a workers' union. This state of affairs cannot continue, for the sake of all those Americans forced to work long hours in poor conditions for the bare-minimum in wages, and President Smith acknowledges such.\n\nUnder the President's new economic reforms, the ability to unionize will no longer be a privilege for American workers, but an inextricable right. Previously, unionization was only protected at the state-level, with virtually no federal regulation in the matter. In her new legislation, the National Labor Relations Board would be given the authority to protect American workers' unions across state lines, greatly increasing the strength of the employees against their potentially unfair employers."

At the time being, the best we can do is grant economic security to the most low-income of people in American society; the blind, disabled, and those who have to provide for others, like single mothers.\n\nIn her most recent bill in a long but unfinished list, President Smith and her Congressional allies have worked together to create the American Economic Security Act, which will guarantee financial aid for those who either cannot work or cannot support their families, namely the disabled and low-income families. It will not be a great stipend, and likely won't have a great effect on rates of homelessness and poverty, but it will be a start."

For a group of people far more likely to suffer health problems, this news is plainly unacceptable. In order to rectify the issue, the President and her allies in Congress have drafted a new bill to create a new federal program to assist the elderly: Americare.\n\nIn this new healthcare program, all Americans over the age of 65 years of age, or those suffering from serious, lifelong conditions, would become subject to government-provided health insurance. Americare would not discriminate along racial or monetary grounds either, with full coverage regardless of race, gender, income, or other factors.

As young, unschooled children are at a very important developmental stage of their lives, having poor familial connection is devastating. To ensure the health of our working mothers, as well as the future generation of Americans they are raising, President Margaret Chase Smith has proposed greatly lessening the financial strain that children place upon their parents.

While many government laws over the past hundred years have tried to increase safety in the American workplace, these have been few and far between.\n\nHowever, due to extensive, somewhat-bipartisan campaigning and President Smith's cooperation with the C-NPP, this standard may be ready to change. The President and her allies in Congress have penned the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, for short. It would provide for the establishment of a new federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which will cooperate with workers unions and health experts to determine which workplace practices are safe, and which are not. In order to ensure business compliance, OSHA guidelines are not just advisory, but mandatory, with violators severely fined.

In the former, preferred by the President and most conservatives in Congress, the United States government would heavily subsidize insurance companies across America to keep medical expenses for the individual relatively low. This option is not without its downsides, however; these insurance companies are still businesses, and thus are primarily for-profit, so there will still be a not-insignificant price-tag.\n\nIn a state-provided system, supported mainly by the C-NPP and progressive elements of Congress, the government itself would be the primary care provider, with tax income serving as the payment method. This system would almost completely eliminate the cost of medical care for the patient. However, it would also cost significantly more, and lead to a massive increase in federal spending.

President Smith recognizes that this issue more than most politicians, and as such, will campaign for legislation which would prevent employment discrimination. \n\nTo this end, the bill, known as the Equal Employment Rights Act, will create a federal commission which will oversee employment equality across the country.

This "Quiet Revolution"- so called because of how the change has gone relatively unnoticed by society at large- represents a fundamental change in how women view themselves and their place in the world.

Still, Harlow was worried about Butz putting his foot in his mouth again, so he asked the undersecretary to review Butz' recent meetings.

Unscrupulous bureaucrats and company men leech off the economic base of China for personal gain. And the high command of the Empire plots, waiting for the time to strike against the free world and take the Pacific once and for all.\n\nAt least, that's what Harlow and Safire recommend we tell the American people. If we're proceeding with an anti-Japanese message to unite the party, we need to further radicalize the base against them. Changing the perception of Japan should be our top priority- inserting a line in a speech here, modifying an internal memo there, and we'll have the party unified behind us in no time."

USA_mcs_68_a_useful_proxy_desc:0 "Francis Parker Yockey is far from our friend, having repeatedly denounced our administration as "a puppet of anti-Western interests." Since the publishing of his book Imperium in 1948, where he praised Adolf Hitler as the "hero of the twentieth century," Yockey has been a major figure of the radical right- farther than the Far Right of the NPP. His followers include segregationists so vile that even George Wallace might have second thoughts, militiamen preparing for a Japanese invasion, and even self-proclaimed American Nazis.\n\nThis does not mean that Yockey cannot be useful. The undue influence the Empire of Japan holds over the United States is a favorite subject of both the president and Mr. Yockey these days, and while his rhetoric is more... unrestrained, if convinced to follow the president's current expectations, he could be quite useful."

# Chase Smith Events
chase.open.1.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
chase.open.1.desc:0 "At the crack of dawn following the Inauguration, President Smith was already pouring herself a second cup of coffee while grimacing at the magnitude of the work ahead. \n\n Though the press raved about how Smith, the 'Grand Dame' of the NPP, had transformed the bickering party into a united front against the R-Ds, few knew how fragile the party was.  The party had nearly consumed itself after 1964, with the progressive and labor-friendly Center group, now led by the avowed socialist Michael Harrington, clashing incessantly with George Wallace's Far Right bloc, espousing 'states' rights' and free business.  The two only begrudgingly agreed on actively resisting Japan, which the R-Ds paid plenty of lip service to anyway.\n\nAs party divisions escalated openly going into the midterms, Smith - whose tenure in Washington, orthodox economics, and Maine liberalism could open doors across the party - had sat the two factions down.  She'd flatly warned that their squabbles were hemorrhaging support for the NPP, unless they put their differences aside behind a novel candidate - Smith herself.  Wallace and Harrington had grudgingly agreed, if only because the alternative was the political wilderness.\n\nBut now that Smith had won the White House, in defiance of political gravity in the NPP, reality would soon come crashing back down.  And although Smith has her own ambitions - in labor, healthcare, women's rights, and the fight against Japan - none of them would matter if the NPP went up in smoke."

chase.open.2.t:0 "Lessons From History"
chase.open.2.desc:0 "President Smith had been quick to assemble a 'kitchen cabinet' of trusted friends from the Senate to work on the task of binding the NPP together - before they inevitably started sniping at each other on the debate floor.  As the last of the circle of five filed into the Oval Office on a sleepy Saturday morning, smiling over their new access to the center of American political power, President Smith decided to impress upon them the gravity of the challenge they faced. \n\n "Gentlemen, do any of you recall the tragedy of the antebellum Whig Party?" Smith opened, noticeably tapping a stack of history books she'd conveniently placed on the desk.  The expressions of everyone else in the room tightened instantly.  Smith smiled; of course everybody knew the story of how one of the major political parties of the pre-Civil War era had imploded, fracturing under the weight of its own contradictions concerning the great question of its day - slavery. \n\n "I'm not saying that the NPP is going the way of the Whigs, but with Wallace on our right and Harrigton to the left, we're not too far from that scenario either."  Smith paused, letting the room absorb the magnitude of the task at hand.  "The papers are saying that having a woman in the Oval Office is history in its own right.  But any President is judged by the legacy they leave behind, and I refuse to have this administration be a footnote to the divisions in our own party!" "

chase.open.10.desc:0 "'Though we had our reservations about the election of a Maine woman to the highest office in the republic, we had elected to reserve judgment for the woman who could seemingly bridge the divisions between the two wings of the National Progressive Party.  We had hoped, that in the process of bargaining a historic compromise between the socialist left and the traditionalist right, that President Smith could deliver a fair and respectful deal for our readers and America.'\n\n'But our hopes appear unanswered by the President's own words yesterday in Congress.  Flanked only by the deputies of the NPP's center and leftist caucus, the President had the audacity to declare, presumably without consulting her colleagues to the right, that the government would make "the addressing of economic inequality and the cause of civil justice" a priority.'\n\n'By all means, we welcome measures aimed at addressing the plight of the rural poor and disadvantaged.  Our readers know many in need of such help.  But we must ask, in the name of good and decent government, whether government funds will be productively used; that is, whether we are teaching a man to fish, or simply handing them a fish.  We must be honest with ourselves; though many will claim they are in need, how many are truly deserving, and how many are simply in want?'\n\n- Editorial, p.4, The Savannah Register"

chase.open.11.desc:0 "Although President Smith and Michael Harrington had made common cause on civil rights throughout much of the decade, they had never been much more than casual acquaintances within the NPP.\n\n President Smith was from the old Republican establishment, working her way up on a broadly pro-business platform; Michael Harrington's odyssey from the Catholic Worker Movement and the Socialist Party of America made him far more concerned with rectifying the excesses of business, rather than promoting it.  But now here they were, two creatures of differing political camps in need of each other. \n\n Smith opened the meeting.  "Mr. Harrington, you know as well as I do that the NPP is being pulled apart between the Center and the Far Right.  And if we're going to get anything done in the next four years, I need at least one of the two to support legislation in Congress."\n\n"Believe me, the Center is more than happy to help, just as we have on civil rights in the past." Harrington replied brightly, before pausing. \n\n"I assume there's a 'but' coming?" Smith said. \n\nHarrington nodded.  "My colleagues and I joined the NPP to have a shot at reforms for the working class - real reforms, not just the kind of band-aid fixes proposed by the R-Ds and opposed by the Far Right.  And now here we are, with the Presidency in your hands." \n\n Harrington leaned forward.  "The question isn't whether you need MY support.  Do I have YOUR support, Madame President?""

Six cases of schoolchildren refusing en masse to exercise their right to attend public schools, fearing harassment and degradation.  And, most disturbingly, one reported lynching of an African-American man in Charleston, for the crime of daring to express their love for their white wife in public.'\n\n'Our readers would be forgiven for hoping that these are just memories of a past behind us, but these are the hate crimes reported to the NAACP over just the past month.  We cannot confirm whether these incidents are more frequent than those found widespread a decade ago, but we can confirm that the frequency of reports has increased since President Smith took office.  And despite this, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has scarcely increased its workload since the start of the Administration.'\n\n'President Smith, where is your conscience?  Have you abandoned your moral certitude, so often praised during your presidential campaign, in the pursuit of power?  Are your ethics, most famously arrayed against the persecutions of McCarthy, now inconvenient?  Must we conclude that justice is blind, and willfully so, against the crimes committed against African-Americans?'\n\n- Editorial, p.2, The Columbia University Daily Spectator"

"Seems to think that just because he's in consideration for the Ambassadorship to Canada that he's running our foreign policy."\n\n The Chief of Staff glanced over the headline, and visibly blanched.  'NPP REPRESENTATIVE ALLUDES TO OFN CONSULTATIONS ON SHARING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.' \n\n "Even if the Ambassador to Canada runs OFN affairs, that's one hell of a headline." The Chief of Staff turned to Smith.  "He was one of the first to back you in the election, though.  If we cut him loose, won't we start looking ungrateful?"\n\n "After my calls with the Japanese and Canadian Ambassadors, I guess I should be grateful he didn't start a nuclear war!"  Smith snapped.  "Tell the representative that he's out of consideration for the Ambassadorship.  Loose lips sink ships, and the rest of the NPP would do well to remember that.""

We are a people who would sooner die than see liberty extinguished. We believe in the universality of rights, rights that do not discriminate between color, creed, or country. We stand against any tyrant that abets injustice and harms the helpless.\n\nSo when you ask yourself, 'where does America go from here?'

chase.open.70.desc:0 "Despite their common position in the Far Right caucus, Margaret Chase Smith and George Wallace got along like oil and water, with Smith's civil rights sympathies anathema to Wallace's championing of segregation.  The two had barely been on speaking terms during the NPP's years in opposition, focused on bringing the NPP to power and deposing the gutless R-Ds. \n\nBut governing?  That required a sustainable majority, and votes were precious in Washington, with a price tag to match - and so Wallace had been invited to a 'morning coffee' in the Oval Office.\n\n"Well, I'd love to help you, Madame President." Wallace said, flashing a genteel smile.  "Good roads, strong businesses, and sticking it to the Japanese.  I think we'd work well together."\n\nSmith mustered as neutral an expression as she could.  "And what about civil rights?" \n\nWallace grimaced.  "I won't pretend that the country's not moving how some of my fellows want it to, and I know America's going to be a different place after I'm dead and gone.  But right now, there's a lot of folks upset with how Washington's directing this from up high."  He made his pitch.  "We won't see eye to eye on the racial question, but I'm not asking for much.  Local traditions and local ways can change - but the work of America is done by free men, not by diktat.  Give the Southern states some freedom to breathe, and we'll give you our votes."\n\nSmith slowly finished her coffee, letting the dregs settle.  A voice in the back of her head warned her that this was how the work of Reconstruction had been left unfinished in the first place.  But even if Wallace admitted that his kind were going to go extinct someday, President Smith didn't have the luxury of waiting for that to happen."

"You think we should have ordered some alcohol to get the conversation started?" \n\nSmith glared back. "Don't get your hopes up. If alcohol helped solve the NPP's problems, we'd have drunk Washington dry - and I bet they'd still be staring each other down." \n\n"We get them together to talk about a party platform, and all we hear are crickets." Agnew said. "Funny, since there's no shortage of topics. Japan, the unions, those states' rights agitators. The goddamn R-D's." \n\nSmith let out an exasperated sigh, turning to the two sullen men. "Gentlemen, if neither of you will talk, I can read your talking points aloud..." \n\nWallace bit first. "Mr. Harrington believes that he has all the answers, from the cradle to the grave. A man's entitled to his beliefs - and believe me, the South has plenty, if only Mr. Harrington would listen!" \n\n"The last time the South had 'plenty of opinions,' we had a civil war." Harrington countered archly. "The struggles of the American people cross regional borders, and a platform that leaves America half wage slave and half free man is one I cannot sign.""

Agnew remarked. "Protections for the unions, the expansion of welfare programs, healthcare programs..." \n\n"He's not being unreasonable," Smith replied. "He's agreed to talk to the business lobbies for most of what he wants, and I'm sure they'll push back on his most outlandish plans. I'd expect no less of them." \n\n"And a free hand where Japan is concerned," Agnew concluded. "I guess we're all getting something that we want out of this." \n\nSmith frowned as the door to the Oval Office opened. Harrington walked back in, all smiles as he sat back down. There was no sign of Wallace. \n\nSmith fought down a growing unease. "Mr. Harrington, you didn't happen to see Mr. Wallace outside earlier, did you?" \n\n Harrington turned to Smith, his smile unchanged. "I don't think he'll be coming back. But we're in this together, Madame President, I can assure you of that much.""

chase.pol.3.desc:0 ""Let's go over this one more time," Vice-President Agnew said. \n\nHarrington and Wallace remained as silent as ever as Agnew went down the agreed items of the NPP's agenda. President Smith watched the unfolding scene with equal parts anticipation and dread. \n\n"The party commits, more or less, to opposing any policy initiative or momentum carried by the R-Ds. We will continue to double down on anti-Japanese policy as our key message to the voting public." Agnew read aloud from his notes, to which Harrington and Wallace both nodded. \n\nSo far, so good, Smith thought cynically. \n\n"We commit to the minor adjustments to the social safety net on a federal level-" Agnew continued, to Harrington's sharp nod and a faint hiss from Wallace. \n\n"And in exchange, we ensure that states have greater autonomy to set regulatory frameworks and corporate tax regimes," Smith hurriedly interjected. The intervention seemed to mollify Wallace, though Smith could also feel a withering stare from Harrington. \n\nIt was a scene that would repeat itself multiple times as Smith and Agnew finalized the NPP platform, a hodgepodge of scattershot promises and claims that served no unified purpose except to keep Harrington and Wallace in the same room with each other. \n\nBut at the end of the day, as the two leaders of the NPP's factions signed off on the document, President Smith sighed in relief. The party would survive another day."

"He's agreed on expanding healthcare, for one. You can't have business without healthy workers, and business is going to have put in their fair share towards that." \n\n"And ultimately, the administration gets a free hand where Japan is concerned," Agnew concluded. "I guess we're all getting something that we want out of this." \n\nSmith frowned as the door to the Oval Office opened. Wallace sauntered back in, all smiles as he sat back down.

The representative cut Thaddeus off matter-of-factly, as if stating the obvious. \n\nThaddeus was stunned silent, digesting the implications of what went unstated. "So our home state's delegation wasn't consulted? On a matter we've been insistent on? Did the Center ram this through?" \n\n"No, it's been agreed by the leadership, from POTUS on downwards.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the secretaries and service chiefs of the armed forces, made camp to the right of the dais; a congregation of policy analysts and Hill staffers took position on the left. Together, they waited for the senators to open the first hearing of the Smith Administration's [GetYear] Defense Review - one of the many documents highlighting the NPP's 'decisiveness' against the fascist threat. \n\nThe committee chairman called the room to order. "As of last evening, Secretary of Defense Stennis has sent the [GetYear] Defense Review to this committee. The Administration hopes that this strategy, reflecting the painful lessons of South Africa, will mark a shift in our defense policy, with the Navy and Air Force leading the charge against the Empire of Japan." \n\nThe crowd nodded sagely, with the exception of two men: the Secretary of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff. They were aware of the document's contents - in a prior draft. They had raised concerns over the Army's reduced role - or so they had thought. They most definitely had argued against cutting the Army's budget - and they had been ignored. \n\nMore than a little blindsided, the Army leadership floundered through their testimony in a desperate rearguard action.

"Our men from South Africa deserve better than this!" \n\n"It'll be rough for the Army, but we're all going to have to pull our weight." Stennis sympathized, but the Army was losing sight of the bigger picture. \n\nIt was an old line, and the two Army leaders exchanged glances. The Secretary coughed nervously. "Does that come directly from the President?" \n\nA tense silence followed. "What, exactly, are you implying?" Stennis finally said. \n\nThe Secretary stared Stennis down. "We want to raise a formal objection, directly to the President." \n\nStennis seethed as he pulled his sexagenarean frame out of his chair.

A reporter in the press scrum raised their hand high, holding a newspaper high to literally rise above their peers. Stennis waved off his aides. \n\n"Mr. Secretary, do you have any comment about your shareholdings in Litton Industries and Ingalls Shipbuilding, and the recently announced plans to expand Navy shipbuilding?" \n\nIt was a poorly worded question, but the implications were unmistakable. The raucous journalist pool had fallen dead silent, while Stennis blinked twice in surprise. \n\n"I don't know what you mean to imply by that, but I can assure you that my personal business interests follow all ethical disclosure requirements. I have no further comment." Stennis scowled, and left the journalists to their feeding frenzy. \n\nAs he walked back to his office, he found himself coming back to that question. It was a clumsy smear; the stockholdings were disclosed, so it shouldn't have been a question at all, really.

The offending article was no simple editorial; it carried the signature of Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand, a veteran of the South African War still on active duty. He'd expected the bureaucratic pushback, and no politician worth their salt was surprised by dirty tricks and slander, but this? This was insubordination, or as close as one could get to it in the Army without directly disobeying orders.\n\n"I will court-martial that son of a bitch, I swear to God!"

The problem wasn't finding somebody; there were plenty of obsessive rules lawyers on Capitol Hill that delighted in causing endless frustration to their peers. \n\nNo, the problem was the same as ever: the NPP's endless factionalism.

That was hardly a cause for celebration, as an R-D legislator had pounced on the issue: \n\n"Instead of promptly escalating the matter to the President, the Secretary of Defense seemed to believe that he had the sole right to dismiss the concerns of our Army. Does the Smith Administration intend to completely delegate executive responsibilities to the individual secretaries?" \n\nThe point was not so much that delegation was a mistake; governing America would be impossible otherwise.

It hadn't outright printed 'influence peddling', but it didn't need to. By tomorrow noon, the R-Ds would be demanding subpoenas, and the other newspapers in Washington would join them so that the Post wouldn't run away with the story. \n\nStennis had assured President Smith that his disclosure was above board, and Senator Jackson's patronage of Boeing was an open secret. But voters would be quick to suspect fire on the slightest hint of smoke, so yet another round of damage control was in order, if only to show the rest of the NPP that their President would defend them. \n\nOn the other hand, Smith mused darkly, every day spent on damage control was yet more fodder for the R-Ds to claim that she was too consumed by petty politics to lead the nation."

Congressional staffers, legal analysts, defense policymakers, and (what appeared to be) the entire Washington press corps took all of the sitting space in the room; photojournalists had to settle for sitting on the carpet, contorting their bodies in increasingly inventive ways to brace their cameras for the perfect shot. \n\nIn between her meetings, President Smith stole glances at the television, carrying a live feed of the Washington theater that was captivating the nation, from the testimony of African-American officers drummed out of the service to sailors involved in instances of racial brawls on bases - and in one instance, on an aircraft carrier's mess hall. The stories of failing discipline and discord within the services, and the NPP's role in causing it, were now painfully public. As the committee broke for lunch, President Smith had little difficulty imagining the rancor behind closed doors at the NPP, tearing itself apart over civil rights once again. After several long minutes, she made a call to Capitol Hill. \n\nAs the committee reconvened, the R-Ds opened with a single, piercing question: "Will the Administration rescind these unconstitutional policies that have so terribly impacted our servicemen?""

chase.rog.18.desc:0 "'Beat Army!' 'Beat Navy!' The phrases are ingrained in the cadet corps of the United States Army and Navy, expressed in their purest form in the annual Army-Navy football game. \n\nWhile the rivalry between the two is usually fierce, but collegial, the atmosphere today is different. The teams take to the field as a dark cloud has over the stands. The whistle blows, and the lines crash, harder and with a sharper crack than in years past. \n\nSlam! An Army linebacker breaks through and barrels into the Navy quarterback at top speed, throwing both to the ground. The Army cadets roar as the play stops, only to be matched by the Navy midshipmen as their quarterback lies motionless. Half of the Navy team marches to the Army huddle, who close ranks to defend their own. The two sides jostle, and the stands vibrate with a crackling animosity. \n\nAmidst the tangle, an Army linesman's helmet jerks backward from an errant fist. He slams into a Navy receiver, who tumbles violently into an Army cornerback. Pandemonium reigns as the teams descend into a brawl, teammates rushing from the sidelines as the energy of the stands explodes into a frenzy. \n\nAfterwards, a Pentagon spokesperson sheepishly attributes the incident, and its numerous injuries, to 'excessive exuberance.' The press is far less circumspect, comparing the football brawl to the recent mudslinging on Capitol Hill, lamenting the sorry state of a government too consumed by infighting to lead the nation."

chase.rog.19.desc:0 ""God," Smith whispered, "I wish it hadn't come to this." \n\nChief of Staff Bryce Harlow's face was grim, his usual affability completely absent. "Turns out the Army plays dirty tricks with the best of them." \n\nPresident Smith sighed. She had hoped, against the evidence, that the Army would retain a semblance of professionalism. These hopes were now dashed, as Chief of Staff Bryce Harlow's investigation into the leaks tormenting her Administration had identified Brigadier General Alexander Haig as the link between the Army and the press, distributing the key memos linking John Stennis to the Navy's segregation debacle. \n\nResigning in protest, and then loudly complaining about it, was a time-honored tradition, and President Smith had resigned herself to dealing with the fallout of Stennis' mismanagement of the Army. But this level of trickery? It was behavior she'd come to expect from the R-Ds - but not from an Army looking to do an end-run around their President. \n\nHer hands shook gently as she took her reading glasses off, chewing on the arms in a quiet fury. If the Army wanted to play with fire, then they could burn: she could publicly axe General Haig, making an example of him to the cheers of the NPP. At the same time, she could imagine the fury that would inspire in the remaining Army staff, even if they got the message. Would satisfying her fury be worth it?"

He'd even gone so far as to advertise his 'good offices', if the President needed 'somebody to smooth things over with the Army.'\n\n"I've had enough of this," President Smith muttered, before slamming Harlow's investigation file onto the desk. "Read the first page aloud, General Haig. Tell me all about your friends in the press and on Capitol Hill."\n\nHaig fell silent. He didn't pick up the papers.\n\n"I don't care that you don't respect me; I'm not here to win your vote." President Smith said testily. "But if you can't respect the office of the Commander in Chief - if you can't pick up a piece of paper when I tell you to - then you need to get out."\n\nAnother few seconds of silence. "You have until noon tomorrow, if you want to go quietly. After that, this goes to the Washington Post."\n\nThe next morning, President Smith found a single letter on her desk. The contents were boilerplate, but she smiled all the same."

I have always believed that a pillar of our Republic is the virtue of the citizen-soldier, compelled to defend the nation as a soldier while recognizing the Constitutional authority of the citizen. \n\nWhile I have had my own disagreements with the Commander-in-Chief in my career, I have never seen these arguments aired in such a public and disruptive manner as in recent months. The response of your administration to these attacks has been admirable in its defense of the principles of our military, and I confess I struggle to think of what I could do better in your position. \n\nTo business: my inquiries with the Office of the Inspector General have revealed the existence of one 'Army Study Group OP-23.' Formed by General Westmoreland shortly before his resignation, this group has no clear mission except for 'studying' the Administration's military policies for the Army. I think we can both agree that this clique's recent 'studies' have far exceeded their original mandate. \n\nI entrust the enclosed documents to you in confidence; I assure you, there are more to be found.' \n\nYours, Omar N.

A lieutenant colonel was shooed out to delay the oncoming host. \n\n The lieutenant colonel found himself opposite a full colonel and a squad of MPs. Gamely, he challenged his superior. "I have orders to seek a responsible authority -" \n\n "Do you even know how much shit you're in?" The colonel laughed mirthlessly. "Stand down, or I'll have the MPs arrest you." \n\n The lieutenant colonel disappeared, before a separate colonel appeared to the sound of shredding papers inside. The inquiring colonel brandished orders from the Inspector General, to which a brigadier general emerged, demanding to see the Inspector General himself. \n\nTwenty minutes later, a disheveled and furious Inspector General could be seen directing MPs to detain individuals and to secure the file cabinets, full of classified Navy and Air Force documents and the names of journalists and R-D politicians..."

Only skid marks and upturned chairs mark the recent presence of the group labeled 'Army Study Group OP-23' in the limited documentation available to the administration. \n\nThe trail had gone cold, even if the existence of the group was unmistakable and the identities of its principal leaders were exposed.

Being lobbied by Boeing and Ingalls is corrupt and morally bankrupt; but taking taxpayer money from the Army to undermine a President is defending democracy." \n\nThe NPP congressmen relished flipping through the overstuffed rolodexes as they addressed their colleagues, pretending to have forgotten their names until the Army's own records provided a welcome reminder. \n\n"Congressman, I know you were just... doing your job. All's fair in love and war on Capitol Hill. But I have to say, all your secretive meetings and phone calls with the Pentagon? It's almost like you invited the Army to debase itself." \n\nFor three sweet hours, the NPP took its time demolishing the venality of their rivals and the perfidy of the generals, all while President Smith allowed herself the small luxury of watching the R-Ds squirm on television in lieu of her morning meetings."

chase.rog.27.desc:0 "The discovery of Army Study Group OP-23 - even if it was little more than a few documents and a mysterious office vacated in the night - had rocked Washington to its core. A bruising debate between officers resigning in protest and the Administration was a sign of a healthy democracy; a conspiracy to subvert and embarrass the president in public by active duty officers was substantially more worrying. \n\nThe NPP legislators, happy for once to have something else to talk about besides their own failings but short on material to make up the difference, resorted to making a bogeyman out of Army Study Group OP-23, calling it a cabal of rogue officers reneging on their oath to protect the Constitution and undermining their President. The Army officials at the hearing noticeably bristled in their seats. Some looked to the R-D's on the committee to offer them some cover. \n\nNone did. The R-D's offered vague platitudes to their NPP colleagues or otherwise spoke in stultifying generalities about the dangers posed by a military subverting civilian command. How close had America come to the tyranny of Japan or Germany? It would not do, they said, to let the matter fester any longer, despite their differences with the NPP. \n\nThe NPP was shocked, to say the least, by the sudden collegiality of their R-D colleagues. But with their assent, the NPP was firmly in control of the reigns of the inquiry, driving it towards a conclusion while the Army staffers in attendance despaired in silence."

The Army was, put bluntly, in deep shit; but the question of how hard the hammer would fall remained unanswered. \n\nThe chamber fell silent as the committee filed in and took their seats. The chairman coughed mildly before launching into his final remarks. \n\n"Over the course of the past year, this committee deliberated on the management of the nation's defense, ranging from weapons acquisitions to integration in the services. And we have found instances where the administration should have acted more effectively." \n\n 'But we must express profound dismay at the disregard by senior officers of the Army towards their constitutional responsibilities, and at the duplicitous means by which they interposed themselves in the civilian politics of the nation. Our Republic holds the principle of civilian control sacrosanct; and in this, we find the Army's transgressions are far graver than any mistakes of the Administration.' \n\n'Therefore, this committee moves to call upon the Administration to take all necessary action to reinforce civilian control within the United States Army, while referring defense policy concerns back to their respective committees. All in favor?" \n\nThe members of the committee intoned their unanimous assent, and with a bang of the gavel, the Revolt of the Generals was brought to a close."

She kept them at attention for a full minute, before tossing five forms on the Resolute desk. \n\n"As you gentlemen seem not to recognize the gravity of your actions, I will spell it out for you. You conspired to subvert the authority of the President of the United States, and in doing so, you have disgraced the United States Army. I no longer have confidence in your ability to serve this country, and as such you will resign your commissions, today. Your successors will carry the burden of restoring the Army's integrity." Smith's tone was icy, her disdain chilling the room. \n\nThe generals were motionless. They would obey, but only after one final display of defiance, of wounded pride.

Now, with the allegations and accusations concerning General Haig's actions thoroughly exhausted, the NPP was finally moving to enter closing arguments and the final findings of the months-long congressional inquiry. \n\nNobody was going to come out of this entire affairs looking good; the NPP appeared incompetent for mismanging the Army, but then again, they had faced unprecedented opposition and resistance from the Army - to which the R-Ds had essentially looked the other way.

Oh, Smith had been able to have her way with defense policy in the end; Congress' tepid acknowledgment of the Army attempt to upend her Administration had been more than enough for her to summarily dismiss the senior leadership of the Army. But the Army, now lacking for leaders and never having been conclusively proven wrong, was hardly in a mood to cooperate. \n\nThe staffer wrapped up his presentation, turning to return to their seat on the Army's side of the conference table. A narrowing of the eyes - a sullen glare? - at the President, matched by the rising hackles of Navy admirals and Air Force generals sitting opposite their Army counterparts. Despite everyone in the same room being on the same side, the room was frigid, the opposing services facing off against each other at the heart of America's government. \n\nPresident Smith watched the two sides of her nation's armed services square off against each other, a cold war within the Cold War, and found herself wondering: who could she trust to follow her orders?"

The Japanese have paid greatly in blood in uprooting the foreigner from the land they exploit, and this effort will not be in vain. To have American naval presence in the South China Sea would be considered an insult to all those who gave their lives to the liberation of Asia, the countless tombs in the depths of the Pacific would be disgraced as soon as the approval is given. [Root.GetLeader] must not dare insult the legacy of heroes on which Japan's peace is built upon.\n\nAlternatively, the consequences of refusal must be considered. Despite the antagonization Japan faces from the Americans, there is a chance the US would behave diplomatically on specific terms set. To refuse the Americans the right to collect their dead may aggravate them enough to truly upset the peace in Asia, through violent retaliation.

Such a naval incursion would protect these men, but also hail a symbolic victory - to push the American out of Asia once again.

She knew that it was their fault, the Imperial Army shot down innocent government workers who were on a diplomatic mission, and now could not bear the possibility of embarrassment. Even if it meant a war-torn Pacific. However, she could not help but know that her fellow Americans were scared. Her mind turned back to the history of the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, how, at the time, Vice President Kennedy managed to alleviate the fears of each and every American, even the ones standing beside her in the Congress, as each filled with terror at the thought of their death, yet Smith remembered her own anger and wish for revenge at that moment. Now, what would she do, alleviate tensions, or go for what is rightfully theirs? \n\n"Madam President?" Chafee interrupted."

Now, the Japanese have laid waste to the capital of their ally. \n\n"Madam President, the Fleet Admiral reports that the Seventh is making headway in beating back the Japanese fleet, but there's fears of reinforcements, should we continue the attack or wait to regroup with support?" Chafee spoke. Smith remembered her courage, wanting to fight back against the terror that the Japanese enforced against her beautiful country so long ago. Now, she has finally gotten what she wanted, as the Navy pounds against the Japanese Fleet in the South China Sea, where Secretary Stennis's body floats somewhere in the midst of a wrecked American aircraft. \n\nBut the President realized one thing: She did not feel any glory in it.

Finally, Smith can claim that with her Presidency, she was destined to reclaim America's time in the sun, a time of glory, of victory, of success. \n\nBut, would it be that way? As the hours continued, she heard horrific reports of the aerial battles over Australia, as increasing amounts of American aircraft are shot out of the sky, until they reach their graves below, coated in fuel, fire, and blood. Land forces were ordered to mobilize and prepare for a full on invasion plan of the Pacific Islands, as various leading generals yelled at one another over competing battle plans and how to finally bring down the Japanese Empire, in their minds. On top of it all, the Seventh fleet reported that they're prepared to regroup, but the Japanese look to be preparing a counterattack, one which could decimate the fleet if they do not get the reinforcements they need out there. The Pacific was on fire, and the inferno was only spreading, as the Final Pacific War had begun! The United States refused to back down after its citizens deaths, for their pride, their honor, for Stennis! \n\nHowever, past all of the reports, drawings of battle plans, organizations of armies, and commands issued to navies, one thought dominated President Margaret Chase Smith's mind. \n\nHow launch codes for the nuclear arsenal of the United States was easily accessible in a briefcase near her, and her late husband's portrait she woke up to just days ago."

"Mrs. President, the Prime Minister of Japan has decided to respectfully comply and meet with our demands. He is in the process of putting together a speech to recognize the Imperial Japanese Army's accidental shooting down of Mr. Stennis's aircraft, and is allowing complete access of the United States Navy to attempt to search for the wreckage, in order to 'alleviate tensions.'

"Harlow, what have you got?" The President asked. "Madam President, we have a development from Tokyo. It appears that the Prime Minister has signaled that they do not wish to press the issue forward any longer, and 'seeing that tensions are high with the President' as he put it, has decided to grant access to the American Navy into the South China Sea to search for the wreckage, and hopefully recover Secretary of Defense Stennis. How should we proceed?" \n\nA slow smile crept across the President's face.

Chafee uttered a long sigh before answering.\n\n"Madam President, the Fleet Admiral reports that it appears as though the Japanese fleet is breaking formation and turning back."\n\nSmith's minds echoed words of thanks as she managed to let out a sigh of gratitude, after barely being able to breathe.

She didn't need to be reminded that things were not looking good. The newspapers, the TV news, just listening to the staff in the White House, everyone was talking about the imminent dissolution and political irrelevance of the National Progressive Party. Her goals, her efforts to unite the party was crumbling. Her efforts to make the NPP more than just the unending opposition to the Republican-Democrats, to turn it into an actual option for the American people, was falling apart.\n\n Agnew spread his hands as he stood in front of the desk, and took a deep breath. "I think we should make our positions clear, Madam President. You've been doing everything in your power to keep the party together, which has required making compromises that have annoyed some people. But that's how politics works. And all those on Capitol Hill know it. But they also need to know that loyalty is a two way street."\n\n Smith leaned forward in her chair. "What are you suggesting?"\n\nl "A declaration, a party message. Make it clear that you will listen and work with everyone in the party. However, when a decision has been made, it's important that we all work together to get it passed. Party unity is much, much more important than winning political points. That needs to be made crystal clear. But, at the same time, if you stand against the decision, if you break ranks, if you leave, then you are on your own. We won't help you. If you leave for the R-Ds, you are a person non grata."\n\n Chase pondered what her Vice President was suggesting. She knew very well that the NPP, born out of defectors from the major parties, could just as easily break apart again.

Senators and Representatives were at each other's throats, spending more time in their speeches and press conferences attacking each other, filibustering their own parties' legislation. All this, while letting the Republican-Democrats lean back and watch the fireworks, occasionally throwing a bit more gasoline on the fire when they finally got the chance to stand up and speak at the podium. Journalists were loving every second of it. Newspapers were going wild with the stories that were coming out. Only TV networks, without film footage from a still camera shy Congress, were restrained from turning the Congress into a pay-per-view wrestling match.\n\n "What are you suggesting, Spiro?" President Smith said. She still was determined, and resolute, but she knew when she needed assistance. All her years in the House and Senate never prepared her for this. That's where the Vice President came in.\n\n Agnew was sitting on one of the couches in the center of the room, right above the carpeted Presidential Seal, legs crossed. "We just need some more time. I'll go to those Senators that are particularly vocal, encourage them, twist their arms, threaten to cut funding for their projects. Remind them that we all hate Japan. Whatever is needed, until I can get them to support our legislation. If they come around and support us, then the others should fall in line. And then, once these bills are passed, we can work on a big compromise."\n\n The President, shoulders squared against the shadows of the setting sun, turned around, and gave a nod of her head.

"How about we try to work with them, all of them, and try to get some support again?"\n\n The Vice President then spent the next ten minutes, quickly explaining his idea.

"What better chance will they have to get their pet projects into law? Just because their nominal party allies will also get something? That's just the price of politics."\n\n The President drummed her fingers on the desk, her polished nails tap-tap-tapping against the wood that many, many men had sat at for the past eighty years.

With the spirit of Southern Hospitality, the meetings in the homes and offices of Senator Strom Thurmond, and George Wallace's hotel room in the Willard Hotel have been the scene of many a long night of drinks, smoking, and backroom politicking.\n\n Eventually, the leaders of the FR-NPP present Agnew with something they would want in the event of a massive bill. While the majority of the FR is segregationist and would love nothing better than to roll back civil rights, that is off the table thanks to the public pressure. However, they also fought for the "little man" and those left behind, and so they wanted something else: a massive aid program for the South. Low or no interest loans for farmers, subsidies for new industries, and efforts to alleviate the impoverishment of the region that stretched back as far as the aftermath of the Civil War. And of course, every Senator, Representative and Governor will have their own pork barrel project: a big bridge across an uncrossed river, a contract to a local business, or some new courthouses and police stations.\n\n Now, any administration could propose such a program and most likely get it through Congress. However, the problem is that it would be massively expensive, and with all the other possible additions to the bill it could make the national debt balloon and make many deficit hawks start screaming to the heavens. So, will we play ball and add what the FR-NPP wants, or try to pass the law without their support?"

One of the unofficial leaders of the Centre wing of the National Progressive Party, Scoop has long been a strong proponent of civil rights.\n\n Wasting little time, Senator Jackson has told Agnew what his supporters in the C-NPP would want in the grand compromise bill: a massive education bill, giving money to raise the standards of schools around the country. Money would be provided to refurbish and repair schools, provide new textbooks, train more teachers, hire nurses and qualified therapists, provide a robust school lunch system, improve school gymnasiums, playgrounds and other activities, and much more. This would mostly focus on schools in the inner cities of the Northeast and Midwest that have been suffering since the rise of "white flight" to the suburbs in the past couple of decades, which have resulted in gaps in funding and the drop of test scores and the prospects for their graduates, if they even can.\n\n Sponsoring an education bill that would give a lot of money to schools around the nation is a pretty popular idea (after all, who doesn't want to help the children?), but adding it to this law will be very expensive and add a lot of red ink to the federal budget. So it's up to Vice President Agnew if he wants to add this to the bill to unify the NPP or not."

As one of the two main leaders of the Centre wing of the National Progressive Party, it's vital that Agnew find out what he wants to try to bring the party closer together.\n\n Harrington's strong support for the working class has never faltered, and his proposal to the VP is massive in scope: the establishment of a federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board, to facilitate collective bargaining and rule on unfair labor practices.\n\n The NLRB, in Harrinington's view, would give more power to the workers and their unions, and rebalance the American economy away from the single minded efforts of wealth generation for the already rich and wealthy, but to enable safe workplaces, a living wage, and benefits for employees, and to enforce fines and penalties on companies that attempt to suppress unions. Harrington said he would like to make this new body as non-partisan as possible, so he'd be willing to have members of the FR-NPP, and maybe even R-Ds, to sit on it's board.\n\nWhile the idea of supporting unions and their millions of dues-paying members is a sound political strategy, and wouldn't even be horribly expensive compared to other programs and ideas members of the NPP have proposed, it would result in more costs for companies with the higher wages and increased standards required, and some of the conservative, pro-business politicians of the NPP would be loathe to support such a measure. The Vice President has to decide if the NLRB will be worth putting in to the bill."

Explicitly, cut the taxes on some of America's largest corporations, and perhaps a few of the very rich as well. After decades of mismanagement by a bloated federal government dumping the hard earned wealth of "job creators" and the "engines of prosperity" into a black hole of bureaucracy and thousands of niche programs, it's time to reward these guys and their companies with a bit of a kickback. With these new resources, they can invest back into the economy by expanding their business, hiring new workers, acquire new technology and all that good stuff that will, undoubtedly, make everyone much, much better off in the long run.\n\n It's hard to tell how much of what Cohn is suggesting is true, that these companies need just a few million more tax-free dollars to make their companies grow even more, or if it's really just an excuse to grant even larger paychecks to the executives or dividends to the stockholders. The gap in revenue from lower corporate taxes will have effects on other parts of the federal budget that will have to be covered with raised taxes elsewhere, or even more debt.

Even if everyone had a chance to go over all the details, and debate the bill on the floor of the Senate, voting against the bill will likely result in you voting against your own best interests, both in having popular suggestions scuttled, or in having your supporters consider you a traitor, corrupted by the Washington elite.\n\n While not everyone got what they wanted in the bill, hopefully enough people, from enough factions of the party, did so that they will vote for it.

Toss some more generous welfare benefits to appease Harrington and Jackson, some directed funding to the south to appeal to the segregationists, a few Buy American riders and regulation cutting for the businessmen. Hell, even a couple of the last radical ideas of the LNPP and Yockey's bunch are being tossed in, just to make sure there is enough votes.\n\n Of course, only a few people actually know that it's Spiro Agnew who's suggested this to the President, and not her idea alone. And even Agnew, the wily political operator that he has become in the past few months, knows that this is a risky move, as most of these measures are being slipped into the budget at the last minute, with little debate or scrutiny.

If you are Margaret Chase Smith, you just throw money at the problem. It's even better when it's not your own cash.\n\nThe budget for [GetYear] that Vice President Spiro Agnew has negotiated and helped put together now has so many extra riders, amendments and provisions on it that it will take an army of accountants and lawyers to square it up with the laws of the nation. And it will undoubtedly cost a whole lot more than anyone could have ever dreamed possible. It's not to say that everything added to the bill is simple pork-barrel spending, building bridges to nowhere, erecting airports where there are no airplanes, or multi-lane highways to connect tiny villages (though some opponents will find their fair share of targets to rail against). Many of the programs are indeed in the best interests of the American people, and by lumping them all together it will be easier to get them enacted.\n\nPresident Smith can rest easy tonight: the National Progressive Party is working together for now, and her popularity is trending upwards again."

If you are Margaret Chase Smith, the answer seems to be that it's next to impossible.\n\nThe debate and politicking to get the different wings of the party working together to try to get the Budget of [GetYear] put together to give everyone some of what they want has run on too long, resulted in too many frayed tempers and shouting matches, and even a fistfight or two, so Vice President Spiro Agnew has basically ignored all of the proposals, writing his own version of the budget with a couple allies in Congress. On the surface, all the programs and ideas that had been suggested by the different wings of the NPP have been added in, but digging into the numbers, it's clear that they are much reduced, with only a fraction of the money asked for.\n\nThis action is yet another "Intolerable Act" by the party leadership, as one C-NPP Congressman declared, referencing the laws that pushed the colonies to revolt almost 200 years ago. Already many members of the NPP, excepting those of Smith's and Agnew's faction of the FR-NPP, are crying foul, and it seems clear that this effort at party unity is dead in the water."

Only in this case, there is no sausage, and no law.\n\n Despite all of the meetings and negotiations, not a single one of the proposals or ideas suggested by the different wings of the National Progressive Party was added to the bill, so there is nothing to even give to Congress to vote on.\n\n The news of the failure of the bill is spreading through Washington, even faster, it seems, than usual through the grapevine. However, the primary victim of the bill's failure, or more appropriately, non-starter, is landing on the White House. The fact that President Maragret Chase Smith, having already brought the NPP into chaos and collapse, apparently has no interest in negotiating with anyone to get out of the mess, and has resulted in more rumored defections and speculation fracturing of the NPP coalition.\n\n While spokespeople for the President, speaking off the record of course, are saying it was Vice President Agnew who had suggested the plan in the first place, and seemingly tried to sabotage it to undermine the President, but few are taking this suggestion seriously.\n\n Either way: the National Progressive Party is in crisis, and there now seems to be no way to fix it."

Butz's uninhibited racism has shown the true colors of those opposing this strike; so many cannot fathom the idea of non-whites gaining the rights that these workers fight for. I can only hope that many will reexamine this strike; why should a worker's worth be determined by the color of their skin?"\n\nFreeman had thrown gasoline on a fire - a dying one, but a fire nonetheless.

We can finally give the worker in America what he deserves. Not just a Delano, but for everyone."\n\nAfter the meeting ended shortly, Smith rehashed Chavez's arguments in her head, and heard them in Harrington's voice.

The more Center would hate it by definition, and there was no telling how such a move would look to the press.\n\nSmith thought back to the recent meetings she had with Itliong and Chavez. The easiest solution could be agreeing to Larry's terms; agreeing to raise the minimum wage would be seen as radical by some, but was sufficiently progressive enough to placate the Center without antagonizing the right too much. A peaceful, negotiated end to the strikes would have its advantages... if all the farmers agreed to it. \n\nAnd then, there was Chavez. Going along with his plan would likely elicit a violent reaction from the Far Right; increasing pensions and reducing work hours, not just at Delano but attempting to do so nationwide, would be a showstopper for the Far Right.

Now the administration was involved in the Delano strike on the other side of the country, whether it wanted to be or not. \n\n"What's the problem? We'll let the businesses work it out. Freeman's got bigger things to worry about, and so do I." Smith didn't even look up from the speech she was editing. \n\n"Bigger things?" Agnew asked incredulously.

Somebody's got to fund the next election." \n\n"Are you serious?" Agnew's eyes widened; Freeman was supposed to talk with the farmers, not poke them in the eye.

Harrington has been informed." \n\nAgnew pinched the bridge of his nose. "Well, shit." \n\n"Harrington's going to take this to the press, mark my words," Harlow added. "We can kiss the Center's support goodbye." \n\n"What's done, is done." Smith said, through gritted teeth. "If nobody can negotiate with the farmers, we'll need to break the strike." \n\n"Freeman and the Center walked out on us. All we asked him to do was his job, and now the Center's saying we screwed them." Agnew stated bluntly. "We'll need to demonstrate leadership. Forceful leadership." \n\n"Jesus Christ, are you going to federalize the National Guard to break a strike? Do you want us to lose the West Coast?" Harlow rolled his eyes.

Last month, you were saying that the federal government would mediate." \n\n"Well, the strikers weren't interested in mediation," Smith said, as smoothly as she could manage. "We can't mediate if the farmers aren't willing to talk." \n\n"I heard that the farmers broke off talks because they thought Secretary Orville was too close to the companies involved." The governor's voice darkened. "A conflict of interest." \n\n"Talking with the companies is part of Secretary Orville's job. It's unfortunate that the farmers don't understand that, but it is what it is." Smith breathed in. "My administration is out of options. We don't decide in state affairs; it's your job to be the final authority on matters reserved to the states. I'd hurry, if I were you. The economy can't be left idling forever." \n\nThe governor fell silent for a second. "Since when were you all in on states' rights, Madame President?"

Schenley and DiGiorgio quickly found new laborers to cross the broken line and resume work - with token concessions, but nothing close to what Chavez and Itliong, now facing jail time, had agitated for. \n\nThe Smith Administration said nothing. The business lobby was pleased, while Wallace had even sent a rare letter of appreciation to the President - and California was taking the blame.

Protesters have the right to be heard, but not when it greatly endangers public safety. And I am deeply saddened that President Smith does not share my views.' \n\nWhen President Smith got to the last line, she tore the letter into shreds. \n\n'The President has argued that I would be detrimental to her plans to capitulate to lawlessness in the name of expediency, contrary to those she expressed a few days ago.

Needless to say, picking a plan backed by a faction will strengthen it and upset their opponents, but the compromise plan is of dubious legality and could turn this into an even bigger scandal.\n\nWallace, unsurprisingly, opposes any concessions to the strikers and wants us to utilize the National Guard to handle critical mail services in the New York area and potentially elsewhere, while also presenting a solid line of defense for Manhattan should the strikes devolve into riots.\n\nHarrington, on the other hand, believes in Rademacher's plan of convincing the largest union in the protest, the United Federation of Postal Clerks, to agree to terms. The National Guard would then be deployed only in limited numbers to protect scabs and federal workers from the strikers.\n\nA potential compromise solution, presented after the meeting by Nathan Wolkimir of the National Federation of Federal Employees and backed by the friendly union leaders Alan Whitney and John Griner, aims to split the UFPC and thus leave Rademacher's NALC as clear leaders of the strike.

chase.1001.desc:0 "The corridor in the Senate basement reeked of cigarette smoke and the body odor of the ever-present gaggle of journalists, fishing for a choice headline outside the committee room hosting a meeting of the NPP congressional caucus.\n\nA younger journalist, puffing on a cigarette as he leaned against the wall, nudged his colleague with his elbow. "Think anybody's gonna comment on Harrington and Wallace's pissing match last night?"\n\n"What do you think? It's the NPP. I wish they'd complain more, it'd make all our jobs easier." A veteran reporter responded gruffly, toying with a pencil tucked into his disheveled hair.\n\nThe committee doors opened, and the reporters sprung to life, shouting questions and leaning forward as far as they dared, without obstructing the path of the departing Senators. An offhand comment, a scowl, even their pace and stride; there were no details too minor to escape the notice of the press pool on the hunt.\n\nAnd yet, today, there would be nothing. The NPP contingent departed the room together, led by a Center man, who brushed away the notebooks thrust towards him, followed by a man of the Far Right, who just shook his head as he walked past. Today, the exchange was entirely one-sided, with the NPP's facade refusing to crack as the journalists' questions faded into a dejected silence. Besides the usual bluster of Wallace and the diatribes of Harrington, which were entirely public knowledge, there would be no scoops in tomorrow's papers."

chase.1002.desc:0 "The following notes were scribbled in the margin of a page in a daily planner, ripped out of a NPP Congressional aide's diary. \n\n0820: Twenty minute morning meeting with the party caucus on how to message the public schooling bill. The room's split clean down the middle and nobody's talking to each other. \n\n1040: Strategy session for upcoming special elections interrupted. Harrington jumped the gun and is running his mouth off over at the Brookings Institution. Definitely not part of the plan, getting sent over to assess the damage. \n\n1115: Harrington was smiling like a cat when he finished. Can't imagine Wallace will be pleased with Harrington's wild promises again - and maybe that was the point. \n\n1245: Scoop's trying to get Wallace on the phone to run damage control, but he's been 'out'. For twenty minutes. Wonder how this will end. \n\n1530: Wallace's gone running to the press, as usual. He's been bitching about Harrington, as usual. Legislators are saying whatever they want to the press, as usual. Nothing's getting done today. \n\n1650: POTUS dragged Harrington and Wallace into the Oval Office earlier in a come-to-Jesus moment. Sixth time this month."

chase.1003.t:0 "Breakdown"
chase.1003.desc:0 ""Look, it's a by-election in a safe district. We're not fighting the R-D's, we just need a warm body to fill this seat." Senator Henry Jackson faced the men from the Center and the Far Right, at wits' end. The resentment had accumulated like so much dust, starting with clandestine side meetings over contentious policies, leading to arguments over committee seniority, and finally devolving to frequent committee recesses just to prevent a public walkout. \n\nAnd if the essence of leadership came from the top, the White House wasn't helping. The President no longer presided; she was partisan, and that had just added fuel to the fire. Now, even simple things were exercises in Sisyphean futility, and Jackson had to watch it all. \n\nThe two NPP 'colleagues' refused to answer Jackson's plea for unity. Sighing, Jackson looked back at his list, mostly scratched out. "What about O'Hara? He's a lawyer, a member of the local Chamber of Commerce-" \n\n"No." The Far-Right representative cut Jackson off. "He's NAACP; how am I selling that to Wallace?" \n\nThe Center man bristled. "So we're only running racists in the South these days?" \n\nAs the two returned to insulting each other, Jackson crossed off yet another name in the list, and sighed. At this rate, the R-D's might end up getting the seat after all."

chase.1004.t:0 "NPP Unity Improves!"
chase.1004.desc:0 "In the halls of Congress, NPP legislators are increasingly arguing less in public, taking their disputes behind closed doors. There are less errant press conferences, and feverish walk-backs of erroneous statements. Voters are starting to come back to our rallies and town halls. The NPP, even if it remains a party divided internally, is at least taking care to no longer show those divisions as openly as it once did, and finds that the way forward in Washington is far easier for it."
chase.1004.a:0 "We ride together."
chase.1005.t:0 "The NPP is ready for anything!"
chase.1005.desc:0 "The party leadership and the rank-and-file speak with one voice, one message for an American people looking for leadership. Americans want change, they want leaders unafraid to dream of a better world, an America that is great again. Whatever that may mean to them personally, the NPP promises them that tomorrow will be better than today. The marriage between the cadres of the Center and the warriors of the Far Right may be a strange one, but it is working - and crucially, the American people believe it might be a lasting one."
chase.1005.a:0 "Towards a brighter future!"
chase.1006.t:0 "NPP Unity Deteriorates!"
chase.1006.desc:0 "Increasingly, meetings of the NPP leadership are consumed by fielding complaints from legislators about some slight or another.

Damage control is becoming the daily work of party officials, and if the decreasing number of attendees at our rallies is any indication, the American people are taking notice."

chase.1007.desc:0 "Yesterday, members of the Center and the Far-Right had a very public disagreement in full view of the national media, starting from contradicting each other over policy to hurling personal insults at each other, and that isn't even the worst of it.

chase.eco.1.t:0 "That Could've Gone Better"
chase.eco.1.desc:0 "Margaret steeled herself when Agnew announced his Oval Office visit with a jaunty tune. More often than not, a good day for the phlegmatic Vice President foretold a litany of headaches in hers. She eyed the newspaper roll tucked into the sauntering man's arm crook.\n\n"Madam President," he said, proffering today's issue of The Washington Post. Margaret swiped it off his hands and unfurled its pages; half a second later, the newspaper flew an arc onto a switched-on paper shredder atop the Resolute Desk. With barely-repressed glee, the President watched the contraption tear Strom Thurmond's raisin-wrinkled mug, and the bold-faced words "'PINKO-LOVING TURNCOAT': SEN. THURMOND BLASTS MCS IN SESSION", into ribbons of day-old paper.\n\nShe turned her withering glare to Agnew, who shrugged as he dusted bits of Thurmond and libel off his lapels. "Can't say I didn't warn you, Ma'am."\n\nThe President of the United States ground out a long-suffering sigh. She pretended the simper her advisor sported was a trick of the light."
chase.eco.1.a:0 ""Be a dear and cut with the wisecracks Ted.""

chase.eco.2.t:0 "Deliberations"
chase.eco.2.desc:0 ""Run it by me again."\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Russell Long adjusted his reading glasses as he pored over the bill's final draft. "Cookie-cutter union reform: protections against sudden layoffs if you're unionized and employed, heavier fines for employers who break the rules, not-so-clear explanations about what counts as employed-"\n\n"And cause for discontent," interjected Vice President Spiro Agnew, "within the Party's rank-and-file as of late."\n\nPresident Margaret Chase Smith nodded. "About as I expected," she said. Her attention turned to the Situation Room's other occupants. "Jeane?"\n\nSecretary of State Jeane Kirkpatrick grimaced. "We shouldn't give in to the radicals any more than we already have," she muttered, arms crossed.\n\nThat meant the vote was now 1-1, minus Agnew. "John?"\n\n"All I know is wrangling JCS, Madam President," said Secretary of Defense John Stennis shruggingly. "I'd appreciate if that's all I'll ever need to know."\n\nAlso as expected: the Pentagon's neutrality unless their budget was on the line. That left the tiebreaker within the President's circle. She locked her stare with her Vice President's. "Ted?"\n\nAfter a moment of silent dithering, Agnew sighed out:"

chase.eco.3.t:0 "After a Terrible Meeting"
chase.eco.3.desc:0 ""They were supposed to help us!" exclaimed President Smith. Her heels sidled past the broken glass jutting out of the Rose Garden's scutch.\n\nFour steps behind her, Vice President Agnew brushed off bits of fruit cocktail that stuck to his pinstripe suit. "I thought so too, ma'am. As it turned out, we were both wrong."\n\nThe luncheon began with high hopes tacked to it by everyone involved. Wall Street needed something to reassure its stockholders just as much as the President needed something to reassure the Rightists that she wasn't just brown-nosing Harrington and his ilk. Pundits, insiders and the press corps - the Three Norns of the Beltway - had already trumpeted the consequent meeting as a reaffirmation of a symbiotic relationship as old as the Civil War.\n\n'So much for trusting precedent,' thought the President grumblingly.\n\n"I personally wouldn't call labor reform part of precedent-"\n\n"What did I say about listening to my thoughts, Ted?""
chase.eco.3.a:0 "Agnew said nothing else as he moseyed through\nthe meeting's littered fragments. Wise decision."

chase.eco.4.t:0 "Regarding Funding"
chase.eco.4.desc:0 ""As it is," spoke Secretary Long as he shuffled through the bill's draft, "the proposal assumes we - and by we I mean Congress and the White House - will shoulder the majority of the program's expenses. GAO published the ten-year cost projections for it around a week prior."\n\n"How much?" said President Smith.\n\nThe Secretary pursed his lips for a long moment, before responding with a conservative estimate. "Hundreds of billions."\n\nLike a choir, the Cabinet Room sucked sharp breaths in tandem. Silence reigned until Vice President Agnew chimed in with a suggestion. "Suppose we let the states fund a portion themselves."\n\n"Then the costs go down. Considerably. Getting them onboard is another problem entirely..."\n\nLong trailed off. Smith filled in the gaps herself - one gap shaped like the American South, in particular. Still added expenses for their state governments, but with much more leeway on what to spend, how much to spend... and who they should spend on. The federal government would have no choice in the latter.\n\nWith the specter of Wallace looming over their heads, Margaret Chase Smith decided:"

chase.eco.4.b:0 ""Send it back to committee.""

chase.eco.5.t:0 "Speechwriting Advice"
chase.eco.5.desc:0 "Stacked on Spiro Agnew's desk were three typewritten speeches delivered by aide straight from the Oval Office. The Vice President left them as they were first laid for lunch break. The speeches themselves might as well have been carbon copies of each other at first covers' glance, with the same words, the same margins and even the same headings - excepting every copy's page eight.\n\nIn the first draft's version, President Smith spent three whole paragraphs extolling the virtues of expanded,  if not universal healthcare, and the specific initiatives her administration will enthusiastically pursue towards that end. The second's replaced the aforementioned excerpts with detailed plans for improving labor protections for every American worker. The third had a page eight inasmuch as it lacked a page twelve; vague, off-handed references to poverty relief dispersed throughout the text substituted for condensed policy proposals that took up a whole leaf.\n\nWhen Agnew returned, he immediately fed two of the drafts to a paper shredder. His secretary returned ______ to the President afterwards."

chase.eco.6.desc:0 "Michael Harrington slammed the stack of legislation against the Resolute Desk. Some leaves slipped out to litter the floor. "Do you take us for fools, Madam President?" he spat.\n\nMargaret massaged her pulsing headache. "You know how Thurmond and the others are," she countered. "It's the best deal we've got, all things considered."\n\nThe Representative's eyes seemed to flash an angry white at her rebuke. "Is it now? I've read the bill end to end; with how little it actually solves all the paper you've wasted on it's worth only for toiletry!\n\n"Where are the just shares for laborers working eight-to-eights eight days a week?" he roared, making wide, sweeping gestures of his arms with every crescendo. "Where are the lifelines between America's cornucopian fields and America's teeming famished? Where are our safeguards against predators with more wealth than the Lord and none of His mercy?"\n\nBy now the bill had become an uneven layer of office paper blanketing the Great Seal in white, circumscribing an angry, panting Jeremiah. "This is no proposal Madam President: this is an ultimatum guised as one. And there will be no deal unless you deal with the people with better faith than what you had offered me. Good day."\n\nAnd with his tirade's conclusion, the Party Center's prodigious son stormed out of the Oval Office. Fig leaves of compromise lay scattered behind his wake."

chase.eco.7.t:0 "When Things Do Go Well"
chase.eco.7.desc:0 ""I believe we all know why I called you both tonight."\n\nTo Margaret Chase Smith's left sat Michael Harrington. To her right sat Strom Thurmond. Both switched between boring holes into her skull and into their opposite's through sheer force of will. Cigar smoke wafted from an ash tray, just beyond her shaky fingertips, atop a table carved out of a shipwreck. The grandfather clock had just struck an ungodly hour: ten, midnight, quarter to four.\n\nThe President sighed. What a perfect microcosm of the NPP. God willing, an inaccurate one come - she glanced at the clock, its arms fixed at half past two - the early morning.\n\nOne moment stretched into several dozen as neither Smith, nor Harrington, nor Thurmond said a word. Then, lips wavering yet pursed, the Missourian spoke up. "It's agreeable," Harrington admitted. "Not optimal, not sufficient, not even acceptable. But someone," he side-eyed a certain Senator, "will do their damndest to block the vote himself if we ask for more."\n\n"For once I agree with the Communist," replied Thurmond. "At the least, we've each made fair concessions for the Party's sake. Repercussions can be handled later; now's time we show the R-Ds America had made their best choice in twenty Goddamn years."\n\nDisbelief gave way to relief and Margaret's weight against the velvet-lined chair. For lack of anything worthwhile to say, she pinned the lit cigar between her fingers and welcomed Havana into her shriveled lungs."
chase.eco.7.a:0 ""Care for a smoke, gentlemen?""

chase.eco.8.t:0 "After a Successful Meeting"
chase.eco.8.desc:0 "As the column of limousines left the South Lawn and rounded the Ellipse, Margaret Chase Smith lit the Partagás wrapped around her lips. Loam soil and dry grass - the earthy scents of summertime in a Cuban plantation -  wafted through the portico's air as she puffed its rich smoke.\n\nShe glanced past her shoulder. "Do you think they enjoyed the parting gift, Ted?"\n\nThe President saw off the Rose Garden's last esteemed guest with ten such cigars encased in a leather box twice her palms wide and set with gold inlays. Her Chief of Staff did good work in ordering enough for every attendee, some several dozens in all. The cost might haunt her wallet tomorrow morning; then again, nobody said impressed millionaires weren't expensive.\n\nWhat common sense does say is that impressed millionaires are worth their weight in gold. More specifically, their pockets'.\n\n"Anyone would welcome a gift from the Preisdent ma'am," offered Agnew, voice muffled from the handkerchief enveloping half his face. "Even ones that kill you in twenty years."\n\nThe President smiled despite the dig at her habit. Now was time to celebrate small victories, like the compromise she had just brokered with her congenial acquaintances in the Fortune 500. Will Thurmond and friends paint her red so soon after she made peace with the captains of industry bankrolling the party's warchests?"
chase.eco.8.a:0 "Smith's cigar-biting grin widened at the thought."

chase.eco.9.t:0 "Transcript of Sen. Strom Thurmond's SCFWC Speech"
chase.eco.9.desc:0 "...\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Now let me be perfectly clear: I have nothing but the utmost respect for President Smith. She is a friend and a colleague in the Senate, among the first to represent her state's true interests when the Republicans and Democrats no longer did. That she became the first Madam President in our history serves as an inspiring reminder that anyone, even those of the fairer sex, can lead the Free World if they worked hard and did their best.\n\n(SEN. THURMOND pauses to sip water.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Which brings me to my one complaint against her. You've no doubt already heard of the President's addresses as of late, whether from the radio, print, TV or even word of mouth. They told of the so-called "welfare for the American people", and the prosperity it'll bring for everyone. But don't be fooled: the President spoke of handouts in all but name.\n\n(Murmurs erupt from the audience.)\n\nSEN. THURMOND: Our grandpappies always tell us that the man who's taught to fish will live a full life 'til he's old and grey, and that a man who knows only how to take fish from others will take his way to an early grave. We'll have failed the Founders indeed if America turns from a nation of fishers to a nation of fish-takers. That may do for the reds and their misguided allies. But will it do for us? Will it do for hardworking Americans, like you and I? Must it do for our daughters, the new generation of American citizens, and who'll soon fill your shoes twenty years from now and nurture the next?"

chase.eco.10.t:0 "Night Debate"
chase.eco.10.desc:0 ""Y'know she's lying right?"\nWorking overtime had its benefits, like full access to the factory's break room until seven sharp. Foreman James took Management's need for double-checked equipment as an excuse to squeeze air conditioning, refrigerators and a colored TV for all they were worth. How the tiny weight leaned against his side realigned her schedule to match his was a mystery James held no interest in probing; in any case, Foreman Rosie had joined him in listening to President Smith's address this evening.\n\n"That's what folks like her like to do to us," his old friend continued. "Swindle us with false promises and leave us out to dry when we come asking for help."\n\nJames hummed, picking at his answer with a mental comb. "Then again," he replied, "the President's a Rightist; she's already sticking her neck out against the party line in live TV. Maybe she really will hold her end of the deal?"\n\n"She won't!" Rosie yelled - well, less "yelled" and more "mewled", like Deuce when he was just a kitten fit snug on James's palm. "Bet ten bucks she'll backtrack on her 'handouts' soon as she finds an excuse." \n\nRosie had dozed off on the married man's shoulder by the time he thought of a response. As he hauled his friend back to the Ford like a sack of potatoes the style of a newlywed, James muttered:"

But the way he stared at empty space in his office earlier sure fits how I imagined it would look. Just some food for thought.\n\nThat's one favor you owe me now. Ray'll stop by the usual joint if I feel like cashing in.\n\nCrowe"

chase.eco.12.t:0 "A Small Party"
chase.eco.12.desc:0 "President Smith checked the wall clock - 6:59, it said. Twirling the lit cigar between her fingers, she counted down to seven. He should be here right about-\n\nA door swiveled open behind her. She grinned, turning around to greet her guest. "Just in time, Ted," the President said.\n\nVice President Agnew carried with him a champagne bottle half-submerged in a bucket of ice. With his free hand, he pulled out the bottle and presented its ornate cover. "Moët Impérial," he said, faint hints of regret coloring his faux-French accent. "Mr. Haller recommended taking one from our dwindling French reserve."\n\nShe set aside her cigar on an ashtray, besides which two thin flutes sat atop a small round pan. A pop and fizzle later, and the bottle was open. Agnew poured just enough to fill exactly three-fourths of either glass with its sparkling amber liquid. He gingerly lifted one flute, nodding at the President. "I suppose here's when you deliver a heartfelt speech to our recent successes?"\n\nSmith rolled her eyes. "I'd have booked a reservation in the Old Ebbitt if I had more than a toast in mind for tonight." She clinked her glass against the Vice President's. "To an economy in the up and up, and a party more united than it's ever been."\n\nAgnew's lips quirked upwards into a ghostly smile. "Then congratulations are in order, Madam President. To sound health and good government.""

Elderly people are an incredibly vulnerable group when it comes to healthcare, plagued by predatory insurance providers and skyrocketing premiums - and it is up to us to fix that problem.\n\nThe new NPP-sponsored bill aims to enroll all citizens aged 65 or above in one common, federally managed insurance program. Backed by the government, this program would offer essentially free healthcare services to those over the cutoff age. Partly, it'd be financiated through a new payroll tax - however, a significant part of its budget would stem directly from the federal treasury revenue. Quite a few small-government proponents already voiced their concerns about the massive increase in federal spending this bill would cause, and their voices are amplified by radical segregationists who despise any sort of government program that does not specifically exclude those of African descent."

#JEANE Kirkpatrick
USA.1704.t:0 "This Land is Her Land"
USA.1704.d:0 "She did not know how many had come to the National Mall today, staring back at her in a sea of blank, unknown faces. Less than a minute ago it was pomp-and-circumstance; a long ceremony, a marching band, a bible, and a cacophony of cheers. In that minute, something had changed. The woman at the podium was now the most powerful on Earth, with all the hope or dread that accompanied such a fact. Now, perhaps a million voices lay quiet, with their expectant owners wrapped in scarves and coats anxiously awaiting the words of their new President: Jeane Duane Kirkpatrick.\n\n"Among the foremost duties of a government in the provision for the common defense; a guarantee, against external aggression, the survival of our way of life. We must ask ourselves: is the government fulfilling such duties? As evidenced by foreign troops on rightful American soil, and the continued warnings from military men that our current strategy is ineffective, and my very presence on these steps, perhaps the answer is "No". I have been elected and approved by the American people to head a new presidential administration. I know full well the responsibilities placed in me by them and by God, and will fulfill them to the best of my ability..."\n\n"...The troubles faced by our nation today cannot be solved by a single man, or woman. It does not require the sacrifice that so many have made in service to democracy, as in the Argonne, or on Bougainville, or on the dunes of the Namib. However, it does require the best effort of every citizen to believe in themselves and their capacity for great deeds. In this endeavor, I have the utmost confidence in the people of the United States to adapt to and overcome their challenges, for we are the progeny of almost two centuries of great individuals. We are America, and with our exceptional will and the grace of God, no trial shall prove too great for our strength to overcome.""

 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_presidency_desc:0 "The election of the academic and former diplomat Jeane Kirkpatrick has surprised even the most shrewd political analysts- a woman with limited political experience and a controversial background was not the top choice for one of the two major political parties. Swept into office on an NPP surge in the aftermath of the oil crisis, she now faces the task of restoring confidence in the executive office and the reputation of the United States abroad.\n\nThis task will be a daunting one- though over the initial shock of the oil crisis, America is still in a vulnerable economic state and beset by domestic unrest. President Kirkpatrick is prepared to respond to both problems swiftly, to curb the influence of radicals and restore certainty in the future of our nation!"

 USA_kirk_72_meet_with_the_director_desc:0 "The CIA has maintained a mandate to operate without serious oversight by the president for almost three decades. They have been left to effectively run themselves, promoting a culture of stagnancy and inefficiency, wasting money on speculative science of dubious value and initiatives that lacked a clear direction. This ends now.\n\nThe intelligence community is a critical part of the president's new foreign policy initiative, for it is the most capable tool by which we can take advantage of the weaknesses of ideologically opposed governments. We've already tapped a new candidate for Director. Once they're approved by Congress, a meeting must be held immediately. Langley and the West Wing must operate in close coordination to properly accomplish our objectives."

 USA_kirk_72_open_the_floodgates_desc:0 "When it comes to dealing with subversive elements within the United States, we do not have the luxury of a light touch. Change cannot be dictated by small groups of sign-waving radicals who only care for their own pet causes. Ideas that fail to thrive in the marketplace of democracy cannot be given special treatment, but these radicals fail to realize the harm they do to the nation.\n\nOperation CHAOS will enable us to monitor and suppress these dangerous organizations. The majority will simply be monitored, those found to be dangerous will be suppressed by our own front organizations, and the most dangerous ones will be targeted for dismantlement. If sufficient legal evidence to arrest prominent dissidents cannot be found, it will be created. Democracy will represent the will of the people, not radical fringe movements."

 USA_kirk_72_the_kirkpatrick_doctrine_desc:0 "Our foreign policy has been fundamentally misguided since the great mistake of South Africa. For too long we have been guided by naive idealism and a masochistic devotion to supporting governments that proclaim freedom and anti-fascism. This must be ended.\n\nThe newly sworn-in president is known for her new pragmatic and realistic approach to foreign policy. Instead of bending to the naive desire to promote liberty and democracy on a world scale, we must recognize that we must foster democracy through the establishment of strong and stable governments that can serve as a solid foundation for the future of a global alliance. These governments must not be weakened by our attempts to inorganically democratize them, but instead must be hardened against outside influence from our geopolitical rivals and internal revolutionary movements alike."

 USA_kirk_72_make_the_shipments_desc:0 "President Kirkpatrick is not a woman to be trifled with, nor will she allow, under her guidance and command, for the United States to be bullied around by the rest of the world. Out in the tropics of the Carribean, pirates reigned and scourged the seas of the colonists forging their way there. Now, however, Authoritarians and Fascists more than make up for the long-dead scourges, as the heartless dictators open the way for the Germans and the Japanese to sink their teeth into America's underbelly. And, like the strong will of British law centuries ago, we shall see them hang.\n\nMost notably, the hangman reaches for the regime of Joaquin Balaguer, who has managed to imprison his "Republic" in a gridlock of authoritarianism and oppression. While the opposition striving for democracy crawls in the shadows, however, we shall ship over our best arms and ammunition to ensure a fiery end to the unjust reign of Balaguer over the Dominicans."

 USA_kirk_72_begin_the_destabilization_desc:0 "Revolutions can have an endless supply of guns, bullets, and bombs to blast their way through the opposition government; however, if they don't have the popular support and the manpower to use all that equipment, then not a damn thing is going to end up happening.\n\nThus, it is now our duty to begin reinforcing the foundations of revolution and revolt against the Fascist-sympathetic governments across the waves. For now, hundreds of thousands have rallied in the name of standing against the dictatorship of Balaguer and his collaboration with Fascist powers, from the streets of Santiago de los Caballeros to the cabinets in the capital of Santo Domingo de Guzmán. People are tired of giving in to the wanton wants and desires of Fascists, and President Kirkpatrick is more than happy to oblige their defiance."

 USA_kirk_72_find_a_frontman_desc:0 "Washington. Bolívar. Lenin. Castro. All of these men stand greatly different from one another, and we may not like some of them, but they all have one commonality with one another: being the shining star behind a long-built, hard-fought revolution that forged a new path in history, and a new life for all of their constituents. The brewing conflict in the Dominican Republic needs such a revolutionary actor, someone courageous, someone charismatic, someone willing to do all that it takes to earn their people freedom and America its ally to the Southwest, to shield the continuous strikes of the Fascist Axe against the doors to the New World. Sure, some may call the practice of searching for such a face to the revolution "outdated," or accuse it of limiting the breadth by which the revolution can expand for the country. However, America's best interests lie in the safeguarding of the revolution, and a shining star can help kickstart the progress as quickly and securely as possible."

 USA_kirk_72_rally_the_party_desc:0 "The Far Right of the National Progressive Party has taken a massive shift in initiative over the past decade, and if we fail to reinvigorate the party to stand with President Kirkpatrick in her quest to protect the American Shield of Democracy, then everything we have built up to this point shall crumble and fall as well. Segregationists of old, Reformists of new, and American Conservatives of now must band together behind the Star Spangled Banner, for it is the Far Right of the National Progressive Party that upholds the light of patriotism against the darkness of Fascists and Imperialists abroad. Besides, organizing the party will allow us to reign in all of the weak-willed, rubber-spined bureaucrats in the party who keep getting shoved around by the likes of the Republican-Democrats, while taking hold of our more liberal-minded brethren across the wings of the National Progressive Party as well."

 USA_kirk_72_restore_war_powers_desc:0 "Some people in this country who lack the guts to stand up for it have criticized actions of Presidents past in utilizing our brave troops on air, land, and sea to protect our interests around the world. Those people are the same ones we have to thank for allowing Adolf Hitler's bootprint to be stamped across all of Europe, and allowed Hideki Tojo to cleave the American Spirit in twain across the Pacific. Now, we have to focus on a greater future, one where we won't even give the enemy the chance to subvert our power across the world. A future illuminated by the Beacon of Democracy.\n\nHowever, to do this, we'll have to take some grand steps in terms of legislation, and knock a few pegs down from the "checks and balances" that are preventing the Kirkpatrick Administration from fully protecting the interests of America. In particular, the War Powers Resolution has put a stranglehold against the President's ability to act quickly and effectively, requiring a full forty-eight hours of alert to Congress in advance, with full ability to get shot down by those bureaucratic bastards, and a strict time limit on the length of our intervention. Thus, we need to tear this Act out of the legal system, so we may act as the sword and shield of the American Spirit across the world."

 USA_kirk_72_make_the_call_desc:0 "The gunpowder has been laid, the machine guns have been entrenched, the operatives have trained their militias, and the people's voices are in the air. All that it will take for Balaguer's Fascist-minded government to crash and burn now is a spark. And America, oh beautiful, for spacious skies, is a matchbox filled to the brim.\n\nIt may stand true that the revolutionaries of the Dominican Republic may walk from all different paths of life. Businessmen, market salesmen, soldiers, politicians, and more. However, while some of them may have the chance to bicker and squabble, none of that matters now that the revolution is prepared. The guns are loaded, the people are rallied, and the leadership has a new face. It is our duty, now more than ever, to secure America's safety by bringing down the network of Fascist influences in the Carribean, and Balaguer's spider-web will be the first to burn against the flame of the Beacon of Liberty."

 KIRK.1.t:0 "Too Soft"
 KIRK.1.desc:0 "President Jeane Kirkpatrick felt the smooth surface of the Resolute Desk for what felt like the hundredth time. She was here, and it was hers, and that seemed an impossible, extraordinary fact. A manila folder lay on the desk, and she rapped her fingers on the smooth, varnished wood, patiently awaiting a discussion of the folder's contents.\n\nA short rap came at the door, and her new Secretary of State, Walt Rostow, marched in without invitation. "Madam President, I understand you wanted to speak with me regarding assignments and removals in the State Department."\n\nShe handed Rostow the folder, and he flipped through it slowly. "Madam President, these are some of the most capable diplomats the State Department has, and you want me to sideline or fire them? Men like Jack Vaughn are-"\n\n"-Too soft."\n\n"I beg your pardon? Surely you can't be serious."\n\n"Mr. Rostow, I am not in the habit of making jokes on affairs of state. These individuals need to be replaced. I have a list of suitable candidates for each position. The details may be determined at your discretion."\n\n"I'd rather not remove so many, especially not ones who are so capable."\n\n"Mr. Secretary, in the coming weeks you will either remove these individuals, or join their number. You may fall in line or step aside, but you will not stand in my way."\n\nRostow grimaced slightly, but nodded, and left the Oval Office without a word. President Kirkpatrick returned to feeling the smooth varnish of the Resolute Desk, awaiting yet more meetings scheduled today."
 KIRK.1.a:0 "All according to plan."
 
 KIRK.2.t:0 "And Ye Shall Know the Truth..."
 KIRK.2.desc:0 "The meeting with James Angleton, the new director of the CIA, had gone very well. Of course, President Jeane Kirkpatrick didn't think it could have possibly gone poorly, but it was better than expected. Together, they had laid out the plans for the expansion of the agency's budget, as well as the "realignment" of the agency towards anti-fascism. Regime changes in several disagreeable governments throughout Latin America were beginning to take shape.\n\n"Well, Madam President," said Angleton, "most of the plans for your 'Kirkpatrick Doctrine' are being set in place."\n\n"I take objection to that name. It's a product of many people's pragmatism, not exclusively my own."\n\n"Regardless, I think it's best that we move on to domestic matters. The agency has identified many potential threats to the United States government, such as the Black Panthers, that it may be prudent to keep tabs on."\n\nKirkpatrick leaned forward on the Resolute Desk. "And what do you recommend we do about these... threats?"\n\nAngleton pulled a manila folder out of his blazer and slid it across to the President. She opened it, finding pages upon pages of names. Gus Hall, Angela Davis, Francis Yockey, and dozens of others. Next to each name was a word or phrase in blocked red ink: MONITOR, COUNTERACT, SUBMIT FOR ARREST, or SUBMIT FOR TERMINATION.\n\nKirkpatrick looked back to Angleton, astonished. "What's this?""
 KIRK.2.a:0 ""Chaos.""
 
 KIRK.3.t:0 "The Winds of Change"
 KIRK.3.desc:0 "Secretary of Defense John McCain Jr. looked puzzled by what his associates, Walt Rostow and Jeane Kirkpatrick, were discussing. Their meeting in the Oval Office had begun in earnest, but so far all they had talked about was the Dominican Republic and how important it was to protect American interests overseas. "So," he began, "you plan on completely overthrowing the government of the Dominican Republic without having a single American soldier involved?"\n\nKirkpatrick nodded, and McCain became even more puzzled. "Then why am I here?"\n\n"Secretary McCain, the Western Hemisphere occasionally requires a deft touch, and occasionally a less-than-deft touch. The plans set forth by the Central Intelligence Agency are not in conflict with those of the Department of Defense; rather, they require them. These regime changes need to happen, and the Agency will get them done, but the United States military will ensure that these new regimes remain loyal."\n\n"Like Guyana?"\n\n"Like Guyana," said Rostow. "Most of the regimes throughout Latin America are less-than-friendly to American interests, and far too friendly to those of our enemies. The Dominican Republic is a domino that might fall over if given just one small... push. We need to make sure it falls on our side. Once that's done, the muscle of the American military will be a good motivator for them to stay on our side.""
 KIRK.3.a:0 "The pieces fall into place."
 
 KIRK.4.t:0 "A Castillo of Our Own"
 KIRK.4.desc:0 "CIA Director James Angleton stepped into Secretary of State Walt Rostow's office with some purpose. He tossed a manila folder onto Rostow's desk. "So," he began, "the President wants the Dominican President ousted by this man?"\n\n"Vincho Castillo," replied Rostow, puffing up a cigarette, "Dominican lawyer, political figure, and leader of the opposition. It's a good thing, too; Caudillo Joaquin Balguer is a bit of a fascist strongman."\n\n"And Castillo isn't?"\n\nRostow smiled. "Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but he's better than the alternative. In any case, how have your preparations for his coup gone?"\n\n"Well, after making a few calls, a few bribes, and a few friends, I'd say our friend in Hispanola has his chessboard set. He's got a few thousand CIA-armed militiamen at his back."\n\n"And the Dominican army?"\n\n"We're looking into that. Word in Langley is the commander of the Santo Domingo garrison might take a 'donation' over a paycheck."\n\n"Well then, what are we waiting for?""
 KIRK.4.a:0 "All that remains is the order."
 
 KIRK.5.t:0 "Long Dark of Langley"
 KIRK.5.desc:0 "President Jeane Kirkpatrick, Secretary of State Walt Rostow, Secretary of Defense John McCain Jr., and CIA Director James Angleton sat around a map of the Dominican Republic, the stench of tobacco smoke filling the dank meeting room. Angleton pointed at various blue markers that dotted the map of the island nation. "Several police departments in Santo Domingo and Santiago de los Caballeros have quietly expressed support for Castillo's movement. When his forces, now numbering around 8,000 men, move out of the jungles, they'll seize the largest cities without too much internal resistance. The general currently guarding Santo Domingo has said he won't have his men interfere, either."\n\n"How much did that cost us?" asked the President.\n\n"Not too much," said McCain, "I figure most of the Dominican military can see the writing on the wall."\n\nAway from the cameras of the press corps, Jeane Kirkpatrick took a long drag on her cigarette. "American interests come first," she said coldly, "we do things to protect those whom we love, that which we hold dear: America."\n\nShe tapped out the ash and laid the smoke onto a tray. She looked at Angleton."
 KIRK.5.a:0 ""Make the call.""
 
 KIRK.6.t:0 "Kirkpatrick's War Powers Act Fails!"
 KIRK.6.desc:0 "Today, after more than a month of political argumenting and compromising, it seems that all was for naught, as President Jeane Kirkpatrick's War Powers Resolution failed to gather enough votes in the Senate. The act, doggedly pursued by the Kirkpatrick Administration, would have allowed the President to send American troops overseas for extended periods of time without the approval of Congress or a declaration of national emergency. It also empowers the President to, under times of war, imprison "individuals suspected of foreign allegiance" without trial. What exactly this nebulous term would have meant in fact, however, is a matter of great debate.\n\nWith a defeat of her plans in Congress, President Kirkpatrick's foreign policy plan seems to have been slowed, at least for now. While the President herself has yet to comment on the bill's failure, the White House Press Secretary said that "things would be moving forward as planned". The Kirkpatrick Doctrine, it seems, will not be stopped so easily."
 KIRK.6.a:0 "Damn!"
 
 KIRK.7.t:0 "Kirkpatrick's War Powers Act Passes!"
 KIRK.7.desc:0 "Today, after more than a month of bribes, arguments, and compromises, President Jeane Kirkpatrick's War Powers Resolution was passed with a majority of votes in the Senate. The act, doggedly pursued by the Kirkpatrick Administration, allows the President to send American troops overseas for extended periods of time without the approval of Congress or a declaration of national emergency. It also empowers the President to, under times of war, imprison "individuals suspected of foreign allegiance" without trial. What exactly this nebulous clause means, and how it will be implemented going forward, remains a matter of quite some debate.\n\nWhile many of the left-leaning political figures in America blow the whistle of "tyrant!", the Kirkpatrick Administration's foreign policy plans are quickly spurring into motion. The new powers invested in the President and her staff have not only given her a chance to exert her will by force, if necessary; they have also given her a great boost to her political confidence. When the next bill comes, it may not be so veiled in flowers and smiles."
 KIRK.7.a:0 "Our work can begin..."
 
 KIRK.8.t:0 "Dreams of White Sands"
 KIRK.8.desc:0 "CIA Director James Angleton stepped into the office of his Deputy, Vernon Walters, placing a few thick folders onto the man's desk. He was staring idly at a picture of a house next to an absurdly white beach that seemed to go on for eternity. "Morning, Walters," said Angleton, "are you already wanting to head back down to Florida?"\n\n"Morning, boss," Walters said, "I'm just reminiscing. What's all this?"\n\n"Personnel reassignments to Operation CHAOS. More than 1,000 agents and employees are to be allocated. I expect them all to receive their new assignment by month's end. There are also details for first moves, individuals of interest, and so on."\n\nWalters flipped through the files and furrowed his brow. "I didn't know you had gotten approval for the operation to be on such a large scale. This is... extreme. We're assigning almost 5% of our personnel to illegally spying on the American public."\n\n"Illegal? Don't be so dramatic. We're just bending the rules a little. I've got a lot to do, so I'll leave you to it, but if you're so bothered by it, you can go back to Florida. There's already a home waiting for you."\n\nAngleton left the office before Walters could reply. He looked down at the papers and sighed, a pit forming in his stomach. He glanced back up at the picture of the beach with the little summer house, the gentle swelling waves of the ocean rippling in the distance. "Maybe I will," he said to no one in particular."
 KIRK.8.a:0 "Operation CHAOS is proceeding."
 
 KIRK.9.t:0 "The American Way"
 KIRK.9.desc:0 "Vice President Sam Yorty stepped into the office of his superior, Jeane Kirkpatrick, admiring the Oval Office. "Ah, good to see you, Sam," said Kirkpatrick with a smile, "I have something I want to discuss with you."\n\n"Oh?"\n\n"As you know, I don't make my choices of allies lightly, and there was a reason I chose you as my running mate."\n\nYorty raised an eyebrow. "You're choosing to inform me of this now? After we've already won and been inaugurated."\n\n"I was under the impression that one won an election before beginning the administrative duties of the office. I hope you don't need a lesson? Regardless, as you know, you're a very... shall we say colorful individual in American politics. Some people hate you, but many love you."\n\n"Your point being?"\n\n"My point being that no matter what you say, people are going to listen to it for the hell of it. You're entertaining, in short. So, when I say that you're going to be the lynchpin of garnering support for foreign intervention here in the homeland, I mean it."\n\nYorty smiled, knowing his job just became a whole lot more important."
 KIRK.9.a:0 ""Thank you, madam president.""
 
 KIRK.100.t:0 "Priceless Old Junk"
 KIRK.100.desc:0 "With a final tug on the crowbar from a Dominican guerilla, the side of the wooden crate flung open, revealing its contents. A dozen old M1 carbine rifles, haphazardly stacked atop one another. Agent David Atlee Phillips handed one of the worn old weapons over to the Dominican in cheap army fatigues that hovered beside him. "Start handing these out to your unit," he said in slightly-accented Spanish.\n\nSo many of these obsolescent guns had shown up today in a shipment from Miami. Cracking them all open had been backbreaking work, but luckily not work that Phillips had to do himself. A few yards away, they broke open yet another crate, this time filled with old tommy guns. The guerillas handed them around, pantomiming gangsters mowing down vast numbers of people.\n\nBehind him, a voice caught his attention. "Do you think all this will be enough?"\n\nHe turned to face his fellow agent, Michael Townley. "I don't think it will need to be," he said, "but its more guns in a country that's already got too many. I think we're just feeding chaos here."\n\n"Maybe. For now, let them enjoy their priceless old junk.""
 KIRK.100.a:0 "Hopefully they'll have no trouble with it."

 KIRK.101.t:0 "Cafe en la Plaza"
 KIRK.101.desc:0 "Rodrigo Luciano Biel Jurado sat in silence outside of the Cafe Luis in Santo Domingo, a few blocks away from the National Palace. Taking inconspicuous sips from his espresso, he analyzed the approaching soldiers with glancing looks from his notebook. In it, he wrote: "Soldiers of the Dominican Army, unit unknown at this time. Patrol along Av Simon Bolivar. Circuit once every 20 minutes. Number: 20 men on patrol."\n\nThe man leading the formation got a look at Rodrigo and stopped his formation's march, a stern look on his face. "You!" he yelled. "You have been at this cafe all day, why?"\n\nRodrigo raised an eyebrow. "I like the coffee here," he replied, "is that a crime, sir?"\n\nThe few people who were sitting around outside the Cafe Luis were now staring at Rodrigo. He sighed and pulled a badge out of his pocket, identifying him as a member of Dominican Intelligence. The officer was taken aback. "What is your name?" asked Rodrigo.\n\n"...Lieutenant Alfonso Ramon Jimenez."\n\nRodrigo made a note in his book. "Well, Lieutenant Jimenez, I must get back to my superiors. Thank you for your cooperation and... good formation."\n\nA look of horror went over the Lieutenant's face as Rodrigo sauntered away. Luckily for him, Rodrigo was going to be reporting to a very different set of superiors than he let on."
 KIRK.101.a:0 "Somewhat useful intel, at least."
