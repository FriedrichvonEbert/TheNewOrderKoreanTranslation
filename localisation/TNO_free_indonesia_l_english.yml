 POLITICS_HATTA_FRI_DESC:0 "Mohammad Hatta was born in 1902 and raised by his mother's affluent family. Their wealth afforded him the opportunity to attend school where he learned Dutch. He took an early interest in politics after reading about debates in the Volksraad concerning Indonesian independence and autonomy. He continued his higher education in the Netherlands where he became an unceasing advocate for Indonesian independence, resulting in a six month imprisonment. Upon his return to Indonesia in 1932, his struggle for independence became more direct until the end of Dutch colonial rule and the start of Japanese occupation.\n\nHatta served as a member of the advisory council to the Japanese occupation government until 1950 when Indonesia was officially granted independence and Hatta was appointed Vice President. The next decade proved to be strenuous for the infant country, with frequent political infighting, deadly communist terrorist attacks, and an ever strengthening grip of Tokyo, despite Indonesia's official sovereignty.\n\nPresident Sukarno's declaration of martial law and final consolidation of military and political power has forced Hatta to face a revolting truth: Indonesia is still as much of a colony as it was under the Dutch. Striking a tenuous alliance with Islamists, communists, and disgruntled generals, he has become the face of the anti-Sukarno rebellion. His nation, Indonesia, tears itself apart in a final, ultimate struggle for freedom. Only time will tell if Hatta's dream will ever be realized."

 FRI_to_arms_for_a_free_indonesia:0 "To Arms, for a Free Indonesia!"
 FRI_to_arms_for_a_free_indonesia_desc:0 "The tyrant Sukarno has gone too far! With his seizure of power and the attempted execution of Hatta, he has revealed himself as nothing more than an autocratic puppet for his Japanese masters. He has forfeited his right to lead. The future of Indonesia falls to us. A great struggle lies ahead, but we will prevail and burn away the old regime in order to build a new Indonesia, a stronger Indonesia, and a free Indonesia from the ashes of the old. Glory to the Revolution! Glory to Indonesia!"
 FRI_to_arms_for_a_free_indonesia_tt:0 "The struggle for Freedom has begun!"

 FRI_the_international_stage:0 "The International Stage"
 FRI_the_international_stage_desc:0 "It is certainly possible to win this war alone, but why should we? There are countless nations around the world, some more powerful than others and engaged in their own, less violent, conflicts, yet united in one thing: Hatred for the Japanese. The Americans, the Germans, the Indians, and even some members of the CoProsperity Sphere desire nothing more than the defeat and humiliation of the Japanese Empire. They are willing to provide us with guns, advisors, and equipment - anything we ask - just as long as we make good on our promise to undermine the Rising Sun."
 FRI_the_free_nations:0 "The Free Nations"
 FRI_the_free_nations_desc:0 "The Americans, and by extension the rest of the OFN, are no friends of Japan, their enemy in the last World War. Even so, many doubt that they'll involve themselves in another conflict so soon after South Africa, a terrible, bloody conflict that claimed the lives of many of their sons. But the American spirit is anything but peace loving and serene, and with a few carefully chosen words like "freedom," "liberty," and "rich Indonesia oil fields" it will prove trivial to convince the Yankees to poke their noses where they don't belong."
 FRI_plead_with_germany:0 "Plead with Germany"
 FRI_plead_with_germany_desc:0 "The Germans are no strangers to war. They won the last great war, and the current government clawed its way through the other contenders in their civil war. They are a battle hardened, bloodthirsty people: The perfect allies. In their efforts to reestablish themselves on the world stage, they will surely not pass up an opportunity to strike at the Japanese. They will send us guns and we will send the Japanese back to Tokyo."
 FRI_help_from_india:0 "Help From India"
 FRI_help_from_india_desc:0 "India, a growing power in Asia, is a natural rival to Japan. The humiliation of the last war and the ache of the Japanese pretender puppet regime embedded in their side like a splinter serve only to ensure a growing environment of hostility between the two nations. They are not yet ready for open confrontation with the East, but our war is the perfect theater in which to test their mettle.The Indians must be made to understand that by helping us they will hurt the Japanese."
 FRI_dissent_in_the_sphere:0 "Dissent in the Sphere"
 FRI_dissent_in_the_sphere_desc:0 "The CoProsperity Sphere is hardly the grand alliance of Pan Asian unity that the propaganda claims it is. Japan is a foreign master, and no amount of ideology can change that. Subversives and nationalists, both within and outside of Sphere aligned governments, plot the eventual fall of the Rising Sun. In their eyes, our war represents a real chance to strike a blow at Japan and it's Asian hegemony."

 FRI_old_foes_new_friends:0 "Old Foes, New Friends"
 FRI_old_foes_new_friends_desc:0 "Ours is not the only organization that opposes Sukarno. Various cells, radical groups, and volunteer organizations exist in Indonesia, some of which align more with our goals than others. Ideological purity is hardly our most pressing issue, however. All of these groups resist Sukarno and his military dictatorship. All of them would be a great boon to the Revolution. All of them will certainly be destroyed if we do not fight as one."
 FRI_old_foes_new_friends_tt:0 "§YWe will make contact with other anti-Sukarno groups.§!"
 FRI_contacted_other_groups_tt:0 "Has contacted other rebel groups"

 FRI_emphasize_anti_sukarno_unity:0 "Emphasize Anti-Sukarno Unity"
 FRI_emphasize_anti_sukarno_unity_desc:0 "We all hate Sukarno! He is too conservative, or too liberal. He is too secular, or too religious. He is a Japanese puppet, or simply a misguided nationalist. He is an enemy of the people, or an enemy of free trade. Sukarno is a great many things to a great many people, most of them negative in some way. Whatever the reasons, we all hate Sukarno and there's no reason to go into specifics!"
 FRI_put_our_differences_aside:0 "Put Our Differences Aside"
 FRI_put_our_differences_aside_desc:0 "The Revolution is a complexity, an amalgamation of political orthodoxy and idealism, a grotesquerie of diverse factions unified by a tearing thread pulled taut with tension. At any given moment the structure threatens to collapse on itself, undoing years of work and ushering in another age of tyranny. We must stand together and find strength in our patchwork heterogeneity; the future of Indonesia demands it!"
 FRI_together_for_victory:0 "Together For Victory"
 FRI_together_for_victory_desc:0 "Liberals, Islamists, and communists are we. Age old enemies secured in the bonds of necessity. But we are also Indonesian, all of us. We fight for Indonesia and, if need be, we will die for Indonesia. No ideology, no creed can break our sacred vows given to our common homeland. Indonesia will be free. The Revolution will succeed. Victory will arrive."
 FRI_together_for_victory_tt:0 "Grants '§YUnited in Purpose§!' which grants (Division Attack on Core Territory: §G+10.00%§!, Division Defence on Core Territory: §G+10.00%§!).\n\n§YNow that all anti-Sukarno forces are united behind one purpose, our victory is practically assured!§!"

 FRI_an_uneasy_choice:0 "An Uneasy Choice"
 FRI_an_uneasy_choice_desc:0 "In our nascent revolution there exists two wolves locked in a struggle. The Islamists fight for an Indonesia ruled by Allah. The communists and socialists fight instead for a classless Indonesia alike to the former Soviet Union. While these two factions bicker and argue, freedom for Indonesia, whether from eternal damnation or class, slowly crumbles. Only one dream can survive if a final victory is to be attained."
 FRI_the_white:0 "The White"
 FRI_the_white_desc:0 "The Islamists are well organized, well armed, and violently opposed to Sukarno. They are also radical fundamentalists that see our calls for democracy and secularism as a threat. Allah's soldiers would make valuable allies, but can they be handled?"
 FRI_islamists_chosen_tt:0 "We have chosen the Islamists."
 FRI_seize_sukarnapura:0 "Seize Sukarnapura"
 FRI_seize_sukarnapura_desc:0 "The large muslim presence in Sukarnapura, also known as Jayapura, makes it an ideal location for local revolt. With enough encouragement, the entire area will flip to our side quickly and with minimal conflict. The local groups and militias have all the funds and equipment they need. All they require is organization and the promise of military support."
 FRI_seize_sukarnapura_tt:0 "§YIslamist Militias will rise up in and around Jayapura!§!"
 FRI_combine_our_efforts:0 "Combine Our Efforts"
 FRI_combine_our_efforts_desc:0 "We have an uncountable number of men ready and able to serve the Revolution. Without the appropriate arms, however, they are little more than organ filled targets. The most readily available supply of armaments belongs to the rural Islamists, making their support key to the Revolution. With the correct combination of propaganda, direct payments to local religious leaders, and troop presence, their weapons will serve the Revolution well."
 FRI_the_red:0 "The Red"
 FRI_the_red_desc:0 "There is a spectre haunting Indonesia, the spectre of Communism. Radical socialists and communists have opposed Sukarno far longer than our Revolution has existed. Years of warfare has worn them down, but what they lack in supplies they make up for with integrated, robust cell networks. The reds can be trusted to revolt, but how far will their revolution take them?"
 FRI_communists_chosen_tt:0 "We have chosen the Communists."
 FRI_raise_the_militias:0 "Raise the Militias"
 FRI_raise_the_militias_desc:0 "The communists, thanks to their previous conflict with Sukarno, have organized militias in preparation of a revolutionary moment. Now that such a moment has come, these militia groups will rise up against Sukarno and his tyranny. The sudden appearance of well trained, well equipped divisions behind their lines will terrify and confound the enemy, perhaps creating enough chaos to secure a decisive victory."
 FRI_raise_the_militias_tt:0 "§YCommunist Militias will rise up in major urban centers across Indonesia!§!"
 FRI_infiltrate_the_enemy:0 "Infiltrate the Enemy"
 FRI_infiltrate_the_enemy_desc:0 "As with any civil war, both sides are of the same people, divided only by an occupying or, in our case, liberating military force. It will prove no great difficulty to covertly move agents posing as civilians across the lines where they can enlist and spread our propaganda and encourage defection. When the enemy's very army turns against them, our absolute victory will be achieved."
 FRI_infiltrate_the_enemy_tt:0 "Gain up to §Y2 Levels§! of §YCell Strength§! to all §YCell Regions§! not under our control."

 FRI_the_war_effort:0 "The War Effort"
 FRI_the_war_effort_desc:0 "It takes more than words, pamphlets, and a righteous cause to win a war. An army needs structure beyond disparate, independent cells feuding for influence among the populace. A proper soldiery must be levied from the population, equipped with expensive guns and equipment. The economy must be mobilized for wartime production in order to feed the frontlines with a near endless buffet of death and destruction. The manipulation of the material world is necessary to achieve the ideal one."
 FRI_set_up_supply_lines:0 "Set Up Supply Lines"
 FRI_set_up_supply_lines_desc:0 "The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are their supply-wagons loaded more than twice. Roads and trucks, railways and boats, runners and couriers, the beating, rust veined heart of the war effort will pound and crush the enemy with every pulse. Guns, equipment, food, and orders will flow through the great organism. Victory will arrive, but only after the next artillery shipment."
 FRI_allies_in_unlikely_places:0 "Allies in Unlikely Places"
 FRI_allies_in_unlikely_places_desc:0 "In these tumultuous times, smuggling is a profitable, popular business. Those rat-like men can move anything, anywhere, anytime. They swarm through the jungles and ports, dragging cargo, information, and people under the noses of authority. For better or worse, the Revolution needs their peculiar specialities to ensure equipment is where it needs to go when it needs to get there."
 FRI_from_above_and_below:0 "From Above and Below"
 FRI_from_above_and_below_desc:0 "Why should the supply network be limited by either earth or sky? It is of no difficulty to employ both methods, albeit to a lessened individual effect. Smugglers and the like can move supplies though the jungles, avoiding search patrols and watchful eyes. Airplanes can bus the cargo of critical importance through the blue. Our supply lines will bridge the dust and wind!"
 FRI_bridges_in_the_air:0 "Bridges in the Air"
 FRI_bridges_in_the_air_desc:0 "Above the jungle muck and bloody rivers soar airplanes, ships of the sky carrying diversities of cargo. Aircraft are expensive, certainly, but they do not get stuck in the mud. They do not get lost in the wilderness. They do not need to trek through miles of rough, unforgiving terrain to resupply a base which has already fallen by the time aid arrives. Airplanes will turn the heavens into highways!"

 FRI_war_time_administration:0 "War Time Administration"
 FRI_war_time_administration_desc:0 "The state is a tool, or more precisely, a weapon. Used correctly it can defeat the strongest opponent, tear down the greatest walls, and lay waste to the largest armies. A state of war for a state of war is necessary. New administrations, departments, and agencies, all geared towards death and destruction, will spring up like grass in an ashen jungle."
 FRI_mobilize_the_war_machine:0 "Mobilize the War Machine"
 FRI_mobilize_the_war_machine_desc:0 "The war machine is a slumbering beast, deep asleep in visions of past victories and age old glories. We must rouse it! Initiatives, government ordinances, and spontaneous private action will rapidly militarize our disturbingly neutered economy. Canneries will become bomb factories. Meat packaging plants will churn out rifles. The beastly war economy will writhe and claw apart the enemies of the Revolution!"
 FRI_salvage_the_means_of_production:0 "Salvage the Means of Production"
 FRI_salvage_the_means_of_production_desc:0 "War is a destructive, bloody business. Liberation will not come without carnage. In the hotspots of conflict along the front lines, industrial areas are flattened, taking their productive capabilities with them. But the Revolution is nothing if not inventive. Factories and machinery can be repaired, perhaps not safely and with a resultant reduction in efficiency, but made functional nonetheless.. What cannot be saved can be salvaged, cannibalized and torn apart to be used elsewhere."
 FRI_maximise_factory_output:0 "Maximise Factory Output"
 FRI_maximise_factory_output_desc:0 "More bombs! More trucks! More rifles! New methods of labor organization and industrial production are needed to answer the war's bloodcurdling bays for material weaponry and implements of destruction. Every bullet will travel from the factory lines to the front lines, propelled by a rifle of machinery and soot-sweated meat."
 FRI_expand_industrial_capacity:0 "Expand Industrial Capacity"
 FRI_expand_industrial_capacity_desc:0 "The current industrial capabilities of Indonesia are inadequate for a prolonged war of liberation. Conflict demands change. The jungles will be floored with grey concrete. Harsh smoke stacks will tower over trees. The din of birds and animals will be substituted with the dull hum of fiery metal and living machinery. An army of workmen will toil over hot earthly fires. All of this for a percentile more of production!"

 FRI_the_romusha_question:0 "The Romusha Question"
 FRI_the_romusha_question_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest crime of the Sukarno regime is the Romusha system, a slavery adjacent organization of labor that compels the unemployed to work on large, dangerous construction projects. The Revolution and it's ideals very clearly stand in opposition to such inhumane tyranny, but the economic benefits of such oppression should not be discounted so readily. Some influential voices in the Revolution have advocated for the continuation of the Romusha system to ensure victory in the Civil War, at the end of which it would be abolished."
 FRI_bite_the_sour_apple:0 "Bite the Sour Apple"
 FRI_bite_the_sour_apple_desc:0 "The Revolution demands sacrifice. If our long term freedom is to be secured, some short term liberties will have to be given up. The Romusha system will be extended past it's supposed terminal eve. Does this make us as bad as Sukarno? Are we hypocrites? Perhaps yes, but it is impossible to guarantee anyone's freedom if the Revolution is crushed underfoot for want of lead."
 FRI_romusha_continued_tt:0 "We have chosen to continue the Romusha system."
 FRI_reassure_the_people:0 "Reassure the People"
 FRI_reassure_the_people_desc:0 "The people are understandably upset about the decision to continue the Romusha system. They must be made to understand our way of thinking. The Romusha system, as grotesque as it is, is necessary for victory. Once victory is achieved and Indonesia is free, the Romusha system will be disbanded as a curious relic of a bygone, primitive era."
 FRI_promises_for_the_affected:0 "Promises for the Affected"
 FRI_promises_for_the_affected_desc:0 "The sun scorched laborers who stand to see their living standards plateau, or even plummet, as a result of our decision are up in arms. It lends very little legitimacy to our Revolution if we suffer an insurrection of our own. The workers must be pacified. Promises will be made. They will toil and tear now, but one day they will be free and unburdened citizens of Indonesia!"
 FRI_a_free_state_a_free_people:0 "A Free State, A Free People"
 FRI_a_free_state_a_free_people_desc:0 "A Free Indonesia means more than freedom from Japan. A Free Indonesia means more than freedom from an oppressive government. What do economic agreements and executive orders matter while the people are enslaved, laboring under the watchful eyes of wardens? A Free Indonesia means freedom and liberty for every Indonesian! While the people are free, Indonesia need never fear tyranny again!"
 FRI_romusha_ended_tt:0 "We have chosen to end the Romusha system."
 FRI_supplements_from_the_army:0 "Supplements from the Army"
 FRI_supplements_from_the_army_desc:0 "The consequential dip in production following the abolition of the Romusha system must be addressed. The people are free, but freedom means very little under the crushing weight of poverty. The needs of the people must be met, even if it detracts from the war effort. The military will have to give up some of its supplies, no matter how essential they are, to ensure the wellbeing of the greater populace. We are fighting for the people, after all."

 FRI_strike_while_hot:0 "Strike While Hot"
 FRI_strike_while_hot_desc:0 "The army, if it can be called such, is disorganized and inexperienced. A thousand of our rebels do not equal even one collaborator soldier. Yet, like shapeless, infant metal, we may yet forge our forces into a sword of liberation. New plans will be drawn up, regimens organized, and strategies developed. From plowshares to swords our people will progress. Our wide eyed sons will find purpose in the field of battle. In the crucible of necessary, righteous war, our grand army will arise."
 FRI_bolster_our_forces:0 "Bolster Our Forces"
 FRI_bolster_our_forces_desc:0 "A great many young, idealistic men with fire in their hearts are ready and able to fight. An even greater number of bitter cynics with hunger in their bellies are receptive to the idea. We would have thousands of recruits every week if only they knew where to sign up. A new propaganda and outreach campaign will ensure that every able bodied man knows where to volunteer and those that don't can be easily drafted."
 FRI_learn_from_the_veterans:0 "Learn From the Veterans"
 FRI_learn_from_the_veterans_desc:0 "The Revolution is not Indonesia's first war. The Revolution against the Dutch imperialists spawned a great many veterans. Scarred, shadowed men with sharp memories and grim futures hear their nation's call as clear as it was so many years ago. These patriots take positions in officer academies, in boot camps, and even on the front line, all to fight for their home a second time."
 FRI_integrate_the_militias:0 "Integrate the Militias"
 FRI_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "As it stands, the Free Indonesia army is a collection of disparate militia bands who act individually with a surprising degree of cooperation. While certainly a progressive, idealistic, and revolutionary way to run a military, it is ultimately doomed to miscommunication, conflict, and ineffectiveness. The active rebel militia groups that align with the wider movement will be integrated into the military. Their leadership and composition will hardly change, but their independence will be appropriately blunted."
 FRI_train_the_recruits:0 "Train the Recruits"
 FRI_train_the_recruits_desc:0 "It is a great, monumental task to convert farm boys and the destitute into a professional army. Hundreds of new military camps will house our recruits. Thousands of officers and specialists will train them in the art of war. Green factories of tarp, sweat, and ordinance will grind the populace into refined revolutionaries. The strength of our men, our soldiers will overcome any obstacle."
 FRI_structure_the_blend:0 "Structure the Blend"
 FRI_structure_the_blend_desc:0 "The Free Indonesian Army is a disparate, complex mixture. Old veterans fight alongside young enlistees. Militias with unique symbology and group culture debate strategy with identical uniformed men. Indonesians from every conceivable military background work together towards a common goal. Some would look at our liberating force and call it chaos. Perhaps a little chaos is necessary to free Indonesia."

 FRI_sutomos_plan:0 "Sutomo's Plan"
 FRI_sutomos_plan_desc:0 "Field Marshal Sutomo has proposed a general plan to focus on the offensive. Using unconventional tactics, civilian support, and a general psychology of aggressive advancement, he believes the Free Indonesia Army will be able to handily defeat the comparatively traditional and rigid officers of Sukarno. The Revolution will be fought unlike any war ever before."
 FRI_act_behind_the_frontlines:0 "Act Behind the Frontlines"
 FRI_act_behind_the_frontlines_desc:0 "The enemy's greatest tool is their cities, factories, and people. It is also their greatest weakness. Infiltrators and spies will slip across the frontlines. Once in enemy territory, they will spread dissent, steal military secrets, and sabotage production. They will serve in the shadows to protect the light."
 FRI_all_out_disruption:0 "All-Out Disruption"
 FRI_all_out_disruption_desc:0 "The distinction between civilian and soldier is best left to academics and intellectuals who exalt the contradictory idea of "humane warfare." In truth, every revolutionary citizen of Indonesia is an asset that we must exploit to the utmost. Secret societies, militias, and gangs will serve the Revolution beyond the front, harassing soldiers, sabotaging factories, and encouraging defection and dissent. The people will lead the Revolution!"
 FRI_stay_on_the_offensive:0 "Stay on the Offensive"
 FRI_stay_on_the_offensive_desc:0 "The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. A permanent offensive in the surest path to victory. We will advance continuously, push endlessly, never once letting the enemy rest or recover. We will pursue them to the ocean, across the waters, and around the whole of the world until Indonesia is at last free!"
 FRI_exploit_every_opportunity:0 "Exploit Every Opportunity"
 FRI_exploit_every_opportunity_desc:0 "Every blow must be decisive, every opportunity taken, every victory secured. If the enemy is taking their ease, we must give them no rest. If their forces are united, we must separate them. We will attack where they are unprepared, appear where we are unexpected. The war will be won through a thousand perfect victories!"

 FRI_rijadis_strategy:0 "Rijadi's Strategy"
 FRI_rijadis_strategy_desc:0 "General Rijadi has proposed a general plan to focus on the defensive. Utilizing traditional military strategies and focusing on fortifying currently held areas, he believes that we can outlast the Sukarno regime. He claims that Sukarno's decaying power base and bickering generals will soon result in collapse. The Revolution will let our enemies defeat themselves!"
 FRI_standing_firm_and_fearless:0 "Standing Firm and Fearless"
 FRI_standing_firm_and_fearless_desc:0 "We will triumph over Sukarno and his dictatorship not only in arms and strategy, but also in will. The Free Indonesian soldier is brave, courageous, and valiant. Fear has no hold over him. Death does not frighten him. Against hundreds, thousands, or even millions, the faintest notion of surrender fails to occur to him. He will stand against the onslaught, fighting to his last breath. He will not take even a single step back!"
 FRI_charge_bravely:0 "Charge Bravely"
 FRI_charge_bravely_desc:0 "Our army will flash forth from the topmost of the heavens. The vanguard of Indonesia's liberation will march fearlessly through the dens and ratholes of traitors, driving them out into the holy, crimson dawn of freedom. Forward! Ever forward towards the future of Indonesia!"
 FRI_defend_valiantly:0 "Defend Valiantly"
 FRI_defend_valiantly_desc:0 "Our army will hide in the most secret recesses of the earth. We will sequester ourselves behind the strongest defenses and stratagems. The enemy will attack again and again; again and again they will stumble across our impenetrable will.. We will hold for a thousand years if need be. We will never be conquered!"
 FRI_heroes_behind_the_front:0 "Heroes behind the Front"
 FRI_heroes_behind_the_front_desc:0 "The greatest hero of the Revolution is not the idealistic politician, the valiant soldier, nor the erudite officer. The greatest hero of the Revolution is the defiant partisan, an average citizen willing strength and courage against the enemy within their own territory. When we secure the power of the everyday person, the enemy has already lost."

 fri.100.desc:0 "Liberty and nation are powerful, intense concepts that motivate greatness and impossibilities. The Revolution is proof of that. Our victories are proof of the inevitability of a free Indonesia. The Revolution is not without struggle, however. Even the strongest bonds of fraternity and revolt cannot mend the greatest divide known to man:\n\nIdeology.\n\nHatta's famous "Red-Green Alliance" between Islamic fundamentalists and communists is tearing at the seams, dividing the Revolution in two. Initial necessity promoted cooperation between the two factions, with large differences being conveniently ignored. With the Revolution in full swing, however, and a new status quo established, opposing ideas and beliefs butt heads openly, weakening morale and turning comrades against one another.\n\nEveryday the divide grows and tensions escalate. Soldiers establish informal gangs along political lines while their officers strike secret deals. Civilians keep their families close and their guns closer, out of fear of their neighbors rather than Sukarno's army. The situation is untenable, but what is to be done?"

The guilty discarded papers covered his desk, mocking him with their pointless, wasteful existence. So many words, so much ink, so much time - only to be thrown out and left unread. Hatta sighed, and began yet another composition.\n\nTo the\n\nHatta crumpled up the paper and threw it aside before beginning again.\n\nThis is not the time for conflict. When Indonesia is free, we can debate. When there is peace, we can afford to campaign and argue and compete. When tyranny lies defeated and democracy rules, the people will judge the validity of our beliefs. For now, we must cooperate, or none of our many visions of the future can or will come to pass.\n\nWhy do we fight each other when a common enemy lies before us? No matter the extent or deficit of my piety or class consciousness, Sukarno acts to destroy our movement and all we protect. Brothers, I implore you, turn your weapons against Sukarno and leave your comrades be. When Sukarno is defeated, the people will decide Indonesia's path.\n\nHatta reread his work and looked at the clock in his office. He rubbed his forehead. It would have to do."

 fri.102.desc:0 "...bourgeois revisionist dog. Step aside or become a martyr of capitalism. The new world is being birthed, and you will die with the old. All power to the workers of the world!\n\nHatta carefully placed the letter in the trashcan near his desk. He usually made a habit of saving any letters he received, just in case, but never before had he seen someone communicate so little with so much text. At least the communists had bothered to send a letter. The Islamists didn't even give him that courtesy.\n\nHe sighed. It wasn't surprising. Not really. Still, he had hoped. To hope against all odds is the worst hope, because one knows there is no chance, yet is disappointed to be correct. He wondered if there was anything he could have done. Maybe, but it was too late now.\n\nAll of his work. All he sacrificed. All that everyone in the whole fucking country had sacrificed. All the lives. All the hopes.\n\nHatta felt a flash of anger. He wanted to kill someone. He wanted to gut the communists. He wanted to fill the Islamists with lead. He raised his hand, preparing to slam it down on the desk. His raised fist, zealous and right, froze the air with cold rage.\n\nAnd then he lowered it softly. His fear and hatred vanished. He was alone in his office. The ticking clock disturbed the still air. Wafting sunlight fell through the window, igniting the lazily sinking dust like embers surrounding an infant fire.\n\nAlone in his office, surrounded by the hopes of a thousand dead, Hatta wept for himself."

How could such an artificial bauble carry one's voice across the world with any degree of authenticity? Hatta looked at the sound technician. He flashed a thumbs up, signalling that he was on air. Hatta turned to the alien, metal microphone and began to speak.\n\n"We face a common enemy. All of us. Sukarno and his illegitimate, tyrannical regime threatens the peace and security of muslims, communists and even liberals. Sukarno will not stop until all of us, our families, and our hopes are dead and buried!"\n\n"I am aware that, even in the face of overwhelming opposition, we bicker and argue with ourselves. We weaken our cause with petty spats and childish disputes. If you truly believe in a free Indonesia, if you hope for a free Indonesia, if you would die for a free Indonesia, then you must put away your differences."\n\n"For in a truly free Indonesia, there will be no need for conflict. Years tyranny and dictatorship have blinded us to what could be, what will be. A better Indonesia is possible. A free, democratic Indonesia, where every citizen has a voice and the people rule, is possible. I call on every proud Indonesian. There are no communists, no Islamists, no liberals; only the nation we share and the bright future waiting for us."\n\n"All we must do is fight for it.""

 fri.104.desc:0 "Hatta's speech made its way across Indonesia like a raging wildfire. Words, spoken from the mouth, transmitted across wide band frequencies, and fed, crackling and true, into the ears, and then hearts, of Indonesia. It was infectious. A plague of dreams gripped every town and city.\n\nUnity followed. Who cared who was a communist, a Islamist, or a liberal? They were fighting for a free Indonesia! Suakrno was the enemy, not the comrades opposing him.\n\nThe leaders, ever orthodox, were less convinced. Their movement was their power. They would not surrender to Hatta's idealism so readily. Still, they were willing to cooperate which, considering their previous behavior, was unbelievable to many.\n\nIn Indonesia, there is an ideal: A belief that the future will be better and the will to make it so."

 fri.105.desc:0 "Like an off tone or the schreek of chalk, Hatta's speech caught like fish hooks in the people's minds. It was an annoying, unscratchable itch. It's very existence was uncomfortable.\n\nIt seemed to be a different kind of wrong to each person. The communists were upset that Hatta, the reactionary fool, thought democracy was anything other than the dictatorship of capital. The Islamists were furious that Hatta had neglected to mention Allah even once. Everyone in between interpreted the naive call for unity as weak appeasement.\n\nThe leaders of the factions capitalized on the controversy. Recordings of the speech have been torn apart and edited for propaganda. The Revolution has become even more divided than before.\n\nHatta has reportedly locked himself away in his office, making phone call after phone call is an attempt to mitigate the damage."

 fri.106.t:0 "Mending Our Differences"
 fri.106.desc:0 "The tension was strong. A single wrong move and it would snap, rapidly transforming its potential energy into hard consequence. The string was drawn across a single, large table: the Islamists on one side and the communists on the other. Hatta was in the center. He could feel the anger from both parties pass through him.\n\nThe meeting began with the expected bluster.\n\n"We must nationalize all industry for the proletariat!"\n\n"We must declare Islam to be the state religion!"\n\nHatta listened patiently, making subtle comments to ensure the arguments never turned to violence, or worse, the cessation of negotiations. Soon, the initial radical demands subsided. The raging accusations turned into something resembling a debate. Unity was not achieved, but, for the first time, the two heads of the Indonesian Revolution listened to each other.\n\nHatta felt the tension dissipate slowly. Although the distrust had not disappeared completely and there was much work to be done, Hatta could not help but feel pride. He had done the impossible."
 fri.106.a:0 "Progress is progress."

 fri.107.t:0 "The Art of Diplomacy"
 fri.107.desc:0 "Hatta, though he had given his greatest effort, could not believe reality. Something must be wrong. He must be drugged or dreaming. But no, it was real. It was impossible, yet real.\n\nThe leadership of the Islamists and the communists had formally announced their cooperation in the struggle to overthrow Sukarno and establish a democratic government. They called on their followers to, from this point onwards, avoid violence with the other.\n\nThis new spirit of camaraderie was not as idealistic as Hatta had hoped, however. The Islamists were motivated, not out of love for the communists, but hatred of Sukarno. They made this eminently clear in a slew of speeches and announcements, labeling Sukarno as the greater evil and the reds as allies of convenience. The communists, in a similar fashion, have vowed to do away with Sukarno first and break the chains of the workers second.\n\nStill, the importance of this truce, although temporary, cannot be overstated. The Revolution, at long last, is a single movement fighting to liberate Indonesia from Sukarno."

Perhaps it was simply not meant to be?\n\nExcuses and now impossible possibilities drifted like falling snowflakes through Hatta's mind. Time was frozen still. The moment the tension grew too great, the precise second the talks broke down - it stretched infinitely before him. The contorted, raging faces. The dismissive, witty rhetoric that emboldened opposition. Stuck in place, a museum dedicated to his failure, available to inspect at his leisure.\n\n"Please," he cried. "We can resolve this."\n\nAs he spoke, time began to move. The Islamists and the communists slowly thawed, their actions increasing in speed. Suddenly, everything was real: The shouts, the accusations, the proud bodies leaving the room, the altercations taking place outside. Hatta blinked, letting the noise and chaos wash over him.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes again, the room was empty and silent."

It pains Hatta, but he has to make a difficult choice.\n\nThe Islamists are already well established within the territory controlled by Free Indonesia. Their loyalists will provide additional arms and troops if an alliance is secured with them. For a conventional war, they would be the best choice.\n\nThe communists are more widely spread across Indonesia. They cannot provide the government with supplies or volunteers directly, but their partisan networks in territory controlled by the enemy can be an extremely useful tool.\n\nEither way, the benefits that each faction will offer are only available if an official alliance is established."

We are fighting in the hopes that, one day, our children will enjoy a country where they can speak their minds without censorship, where they may vote in fair elections to decide their own government, where they can enjoy freedom and pursue happiness.\n\nThis dream is not yet realized, however. Our revolution to depose the autocrat Sukarno is anything but assured in its victory. Our brave soldiers fight and die in the jungles for a future they will not see. Their sacrifice must not be in vain.\n\nWe are requesting weapons, to be direct. Guns will win the war. Guns will secure liberty for our people.

"This came in this morning straight from Washington, figuratively speaking. I haven't read it yet." Hatta paused. "I'm not sure I want to."\n\n"If you won't read it I will." sputtered the first advisor. In one fluid motion, he swiped the envelope, opened it, and skimmed the letter. After a moment of reading, he started to laugh. He laughed maniacally, dropping the letter on to the ground. His eyes filled with tears and he cupped his face in his palms.\n\n"Well?" asked the second advisor. "What did they say?" But his colleague, who was now wheezing, was incapable of giving a response. "Damn it, I'll read it myself." he declared. He picked the letter up off of the floor and read it, muttering the words to himself. Unlike his companion, he read the entire message before looking up. He was dead silent..\n\nHatta was impatient now. "What did they say? Are the Americans going to help?"\n\nThe second advisor looked at him blankly. His forehead creased in confusion.\n\n"Did you really think they would back down, sir?" asked the first advisor, finally regaining his breath. "You need more faith."\n\n"Yes sir, they're coming." stated the second advisor in a low, quiet voice. "The yanks are coming."\n\nBreaking his professional composure, Hatta yelled at the top of his lungs."

 fri.202.desc:0 "Hatta wished he was disappointed. Hatta wished he could feel his hope crushed, if only to know that it had existed at all. But he felt nothing as he held the expensive, officially unofficial looking letter.\n\n"Maybe they're open to further negotiations? Or perhaps they are promising limited aid?" the second advisor asked nervously.\n\n"No, I'm afraid the language is very clear." sneered the first advisor. "The Americans have abandoned us, not that we need them that is."\n\n"It's always good to have allies." remarked Hatta. "Especially ones as powerful as the United States."\n\n"I think we should send another letter." faintly advised the second advisor.\n\n"What for?" countered the first. "The Americans have proven that they don't give a damn about democracy, freedom, or even fucking up the Rising Sun." He shook his head. "They don't want to 'inflame tensions' as if half of them aren't frothing at the mouth to bomb Tokyo."\n\nHatta let his mind drift far away from the routine petty spat between his advisors. Without American support, the war would be difficult, maybe impossible. More than that, the factions composing Free Indonesia would grow restless and worried. The front was breaking, all because the Yankees weren't ready for another adventure."

 fri.203.desc:0 "It was only a matter of time, Suharto was sure. The picture he had painted for Sukarno was an exquisite one. Suharto was at heart, a brilliant painter, deliberate in his strokes and with in eye to produce just what everyone else was dying to see. His plan, his operation into Borneo, was a simple one, far from the bombastic and bloody one Suharto presented. He knew what made people tick and how to twist his words and actions to mold into whatever situation he was in, it was a specialty of the man from a young age. Suharto, usually one to keep his head down and avoid confrontation, also made sure his reputation was one of bloodlust, that way when one met him, they would be caught off-guard by his demeanor, leaving them open to be capitalized and exploited.\n\nAs Suharto strode into the President's office, he knew he would be granted command of Operation Magok. "Good morning, Mr. President." Suharto greeted, closing the door behind him.\n\n"Ah, about time you found your way back here. As you understand, our situation is an extremely precarious one. There is no room for failure." Sukarno stared deep into the eyes of Suharto, trying to get a read on the man. "I don't believe you are up to the task."\n\nSuharto nearly ripped the fabric off the chair he sat in as he jerked back, "What do you mean? You mean to let Nasution lead us into battle? I don't believe you are familiar with his doctrine at all! We cannot defend our way into an invasion! Are you stu-"\n\nSukarno raised a hand and smiled softly, "Ah, ah, ah, you are right exactly Suharto. There is no time to waste in the slightest. I am looking for a man filled with passion and vitriol. Judging by my mangled armrest, I would say you are overflowing with passion."\n\nSuharto stopped breathing for a split second. For once, Suharto was the one to be caught of guard. Quickly, Suharto rose and smoothed out his jacket, stammering out a goodbye as he fled the room."

Could he sleep at night with a charge lead by General Abdul Haris Nasution? Would Suharto bring a swift end to this war? Sukarno flipped the manila envelope over, on it's back was a black bird soaring over a red field, the symbol of the Tentara Nasional. Sukarno flipped the envelope over again quickly and took his eyes off his desk, looking up to the pictures adorning his walls. They were more than photographs, they were memories, they were experiences. All the operations against the Dutch, fighting insurgences, and battling in the Assembly, it reminded him of who was there for Sukarno from day one, who he fought alongside, and who would defend Indonesia long after his death.\n\n"Nasution?" Sukarno barked into the phone, "Nasution are you there?"\n\nNasution grinned and adjusted his cap, holding the phone with his cheek, "Yes, yes, I am here Mr. President, what do you need of me?\n\n"I need someone who cares, Nasution. I need someone who won't let a single life go to waste.""\n\nNasution's grin began to fade as he recognized the severity in his tone, "W-well of course. My men are my own, I would never lead them into a battle I was not confident in winning." The other end of the line was silent for sometime. "Mr. President?"

The Revolution as a whole, in fact, has a particular Anti Sukarno angle to everything within it.\n\nIn all of Indonesia, the Romusha system is recognized as Sukarno's greatest crime. Forced labor is only ever popular with the rich and the thoroughly indoctrinated. With such unpopularity, the Romusha system would be an excellent target for the Indonesian Revolutionaries. Tyranny, slavery, and Sukarno - all destroyed in a single stroke of the pen.\n\nIf only it were so.\n\nThe Romusha system, in all its horror, has garnered many supporters with the Revolution. Leaders and strategists, drawn to the sweet honey of unpaid, endless labor, convene meeting after meeting, arguing that the Romusha system must remain, if only until the end of the war. Opposing them are the idealists and revolutionaries lacking the "ends" mentality. They argue that the Romusha system is immoral and should be destroyed immediately, regardless of the cost.\n\nThe Romusha question has been asked a hundred times over.

While their effect on our army has been limited due to their lack of training, equipment, and men, it represents a shift in the enemy's strategy from engaging our troops head on.\n\nIt appears that Hatta and his generals are resorting to unconventional tactics to win the war.

"I still think we need to be more forward. They'll hardly help us if what we're saying is obscured by bombastic rhetoric."\n\n"What if we refer to the government as Uncle Sam? That's something the Americans do, right?" suggested the first advisor.\n\n"That's the dumbest fucking thing you've ever said." snipped the second.\n\n"At least I'm suggesting ideas. I don't see you doing anything besides..."\n\nWhile they argued Hatta's fingers danced across the keys.

Not as descriptive as I would have been, but it gets the point across." said the second.\n\nThe first snatched it out of his hands and quickly skimmed it. "There aren't hardly enough allusions to the American Revolution. How are we supposed to get the Yanks to help us if we don't make them feel good about themselves?"\n\nHatta took the paper back and stood up, stretching his back after a long day of writing. "You two can spend the night writing something better if you want, but I'm going to bed."\n\nWith that Hatta made his way through the building, anticipating the comfort of his bed.

 FRI_the_romusha_issue:0 "The Romusha Issue"
 FRI_the_romusha_issue_desc:0 "In those territories liberated from the Japanese yoke, bountless Romusha suddenly find themselves without employment, for better or for worse. Though some have joined our valiant fighters in their armed struggle, the majority faces uncertainty and anxiety over their future prospects.\n\nThe pragmatist would argue that they could still be put to use, in return for more war materiel until the Japanese puppets have been defeated. The idealist demands the immediate liberation of all Indonesians from foreign imperialism. Either way, a choice has to be made."
 FRI_the_romusha_issue1:0 "Romusha Continued"
 FRI_the_romusha_issue1_desc:0 "The decision to continue the Romusha system has not been a popular one. Although forced labor is a great boon to the production of armaments, it has an overall negative effect on support for the government and the war. The irony of a revolution fighting for freedom while practicing what is essentially slavery has not gone unnoticed, least of all by the workers toiling in the factories."

Promises of eventual freedom have done little to quell the resentment."
 FRI_disorganized_forces:0 "Disorganized Forces"
 FRI_disorganized_forces_desc:0 "Our current armed forces is best described as a chaotic mess. Army defectors, numerous militia of varying qualities, and eager yet inexperienced recruits make for a clashing mixture of the most diverse tactics and structures. In practice, this severely hampers the effectiveness of our fighters, exabercated by the absence of a strong, central command. We must swiftly adopt more cohesive structures in both forces and command, lest the liberation of Indonesia falter in the face of our incompetence."

 FRI_critical_supply_shortage_desc:0 "With naval routes blockaded by enemy fleets, logistics between the Indonesian islands can prove to be quite challenging to manage. While some other ways can certainly be found around this conundrum, our means of supply are further constricted by our lacking capacities to produce more military materiel. We must secure supply lines outside of the enemy's grasp and ramp up our military production as soon as possible."

 FRI_the_free_indonesian_army_desc:0 "The Free Indonesian Army is the greatest force of liberation to ever exist. Every soldier knows his duty to his nation and to the liberty of his fellow Indonesians. Every commander makes plans with the intention of liberating the most innocents from Sukarno's tyrannical grip. The people cheer and celebrate at the Army's arrival, relieved that they are, at long last, free.\n\nFor Indonesia!"
 FRI_sutomos_plan:0 "Sutomo's Plan"
 FRI_sutomos_plan_desc:0 "Sutomo's Plan aims to end the war as rapidly as possible through aggressive, unorthodox tactics. The army as a whole will become a rollling, unending offensive crashing through enemy lines in direct battle and harrassing them within their own territory with partisans. With luck, Sukarno's rigid strategy will prove unadaptive our attacks and a series of decisive battles will bring a quick end to this destructive civil war."

 FRI_smuggler_assistance:0 "Smuggler Assistance"
 FRI_smuggler_assistance_desc:0 "Despite their unsavory reputation, the many smugglers of Indonesia are no friend to Sukarno and therefore a very good friend to us. With promises of amnesty for any past crimes commited under the previous regime, the various criminal elements of Indonesia have flocked to our side. Trawling trhough rivers and seas and crawling through jungles and mud, they both guide and supply our soldiers in our quest to liberate Indonesia."
 FRI_unified_supply_lines:0 "Unified Supply Lines"
 FRI_unified_supply_lines_desc:0 "A combination of both land and aerial supply routes has created a truly efficient system for the maintenance of our troops. Heavy and unimportant supplies take the long way through jungles and along dirt, arriving at their destinations at a carefully calculated date. Lighter or more critical supplies take an express trip above the treeline, reaching their destinations in record time."
 FRI_air_mail:0 "Air Mail"
 FRI_air_mail_desc:0 "A fleet of civilian and stolen military aircraft fills the skies, transporting supplies across Indonesia to our soldiers, ever hungery for ammunition and rations. The speed of these aerial couriers grants a significant degree of flexibility to our strategists. When a resupply can arrive in just a few hours, its possible to make attacks will weapons that are miles away."
 FRI_USA_backchannels_desc:0 "The Yankees are here! The Americans have begun officially unofficailly supporting our war against Sukarno. Their promise of future aide is enough to invigorate our leaders and generals with a new found optimism and vigor."
 FRI_USA_secure_supply_lines_desc:0 "The Americans have begun providing material and logistical aide to our amry. Their support ensures that our men never want for provisions or other neccesities. As equipment is supplemented, the strain on our paper thin supply lines is lessened."
 FRI_USA_saf_lessons_desc:0 "The Americans have begun sharing their military expertise honed to perfection during their adventure in South Africa. Though the enemy we face are not exactly the same as German SS, American experience will be invaluable in our effort to secure victory."
