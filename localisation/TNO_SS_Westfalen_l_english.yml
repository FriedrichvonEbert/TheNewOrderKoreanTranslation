 POLITICS_FRITZ_KLINGENBERG_DESC:0 "No, no, no. Can't do it, it's not possible. Luck and chaos, chaos and luck. That can't win a war. That cannot save Germany...\n\nSS-Standartenführer Fritz Klingenberg may not have been born under the colorful banners of the mighty German nobility, nor had he been honored as a courageous defender of the German Empire within the Great War, nor had he even been crowned as the most champion of commanders within the victorious Second World War. But Fritz Klingenberg was born with a will to fight, the wits to make a good fight, and the luck to make him win the fight. Navigating his way through the leadership positions of the Waffen-SS wasn't an easy task, and most men die in their failure of trying to do that. But to Klingenberg, this would be another test, and test him life did.\n\nHowever, no matter the fall, no matter the setback, Klingenberg found himself hopping up just at the last minute, attaining for him just enough to truly find command without burden within the Deutsche-SS: crushing the rats of resistance. After all, how bad could it be for the most Aryan of Aryans armed with the finest equipment the Reich had to offer to go around sniffing the shadows of those who opposed the Reich?\n\nHowever, nothing prepared Klingenberg for Heydrich's stand against the Reichsführer-SS, no one had been prepared at all. At first it was just slave revolts and basement-dwelling, sniveling mutts of resistance. But now, his own men have turned against one another, and the Reichsführer-SS has not been answering his pleas..."

 SSW_wewelsburg_citadel_project:0 "The Wewelsburg Citadel Project"
 SSW_wewelsburg_citadel_project_desc:0 "Originally a brainchild of The Reichsführer, The Wewelsburg Citadel was a planned expansion of Wewelsburg Castle to a massive scale; so that it would serve as the new center for the Aryan Race. Though the project was never begun before the West Russian War, newly promoted Obergruppenführer Fritz Klingenberg has made accomplishing The Reichsführer's vision his top priority. His hopes are that, on seeing his ability to organize such a massive project and seeing his dream come to vision, that The Reichsführer will grant Klingenberg control over more land across Germania."
 SSW_wewelsburg_citadel_project_tt:0 "§RThis project requires constant investment and upkeep, both in money and slaves, to keep it going.§!"
 
 SSW_a_unit_divided:0 "A Unit Divided"
 SSW_a_unit_divided_desc:0 "Klingenberg finds himself trapped within his own fiefdom. His hardline SS partisan hunters have begun to suspect and accuse one another of being the enemy. What these men used to scour forest hideouts and basements searching for partisans, they now scour through the patrol bases and headquarters of their fellow units, suspecting one another of being one of Heydrich's traitors."
 
 SSW_come_in_ostparis:0 "Come in, Ost-Paris!"
 SSW_come_in_ostparis_desc:0 "Klingenberg's fiefdom is in a tenuous situation. Any moment now Westfalen may erupt into bloodshed, and Klingenberg lacks both the expertise or the resources to put a stop to it. He needs Himmler to come to his aid now, more than ever. Yet the lines to Ost-Paris ring without an answer. Westfalen calls for aid, and Burgundy has yet to answer."
