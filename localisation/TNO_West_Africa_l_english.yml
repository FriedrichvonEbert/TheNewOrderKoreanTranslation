In the wake of the chaos of the German Civil War erupting in Europe and the destruction of the South African War, the two states have founded a mutual defense pact. A joint declaration from presidents Leopold Senghor and Modibo Keita was released today, revealing that the nations had committed to a "West African Alliance", stating that "the aggression displayed by the German colonialists shows that our concern of further attacks is completely justified".\n\nIt would seem that the Africans are not the only ones who have seen which way the wind is blowing, as the remnant state of Free France has offered to join the pact, purportedly in good faith, in an effort to "safeguard the spirit of freedom and democracy in West Africa"."

  west_african_crisis.16.d: "Cameroonian Foreign Minister Jean Fochivé and the Japanese representatives face each other. Officials of both parties were sitting stiffly, and while their faces were kept blank, neither were able to fully hide their true feelings. From the moment the Japanese had arrived on the airstrip, unease had permeated the air.\n\nJean did not want them there. The Japanese did not want them either. Yet they were here all the same. Not because they wanted to, but because they had to.\n\nJean had serious reservations with the Japanese. They were not the Americans or Germans, but he was not stupid. The Japanese and their 'Co-Prosperity' were no less imperialistic than American hegemony - and even if they were not, relying on a foreign nation to help remove the colonialist rot from their continent left a sour taste in his mouth.\n\nThe Japanese likely considered his own government unreliable as well, especially since they had no common interests beyond seeing the OFN and the French pushed out. Unfortunately, it would have to be enough. "We both know the priorities," Jean said. "The OFN presence is unacceptable. We want them out, and to be left to ourselves."\n\n"Of course," the Japanese ambassador said mechanically. "Japan is, of course, prepared to assist in your struggle to purge the imperialists and colonialists from your country."\n\nJean kept his expression neutral. "And in return?"\n\n"Merely that this be a foundational relationship between our two peoples - after your victory, of course" the ambassador said without smiling. "We do not have strings on our aid, unlike the Americans." Jean knew that was a lie, but knew it was the best they were going to get. And if they wanted to win, they had no choice but to accept help."

  west_african_crisis.20.desc: "Since the West African Conflict ended in PALF victory, their intentions have been made increasingly clear as time has passed on, both to ourselves and their new neighbors. Among those which have not already been invaded and integrated into the Pan-African sphere is the Mano River pact, consisting of Liberia and Sierra Leone, not counting all those troops from the initial West African Conflict which have fled into these neighboring states. Of course, our relationship with Liberia de jure is a total guarantee of independence, though with the Oil Crisis claiming much of our attention away from the region, we are effectively unable to stage a proper intervention.\n\nAt this point, we have two clear options:\n\nThe first is to fulfill our past obligations with Liberia and send aid however we can. While given the circumstances this will be much less effective than we would have hoped, this could very well be our last good chance to establish allies in West Africa, let alone maintain some modicum of freedom for the last remaining free states in the region.\n\nAlternatively, the OFN as a whole is stretched thin as it stands, and that is to say nothing of the political consequences of diving headfirst into a war that has already been lost once. We already deal with the veterans of the last war, and it would be unwise to lose twice.\n\nRegardless of the decision, evacuation and reconsolidation or intervention and investment, West Africa hangs in the balance."

President Johnson lifted a manilla folder from the small stack covering his desk and handed it to the Secretary of Defense. "The alliance will hold, this isn't South Africa- the pan-Africanists won't fight to the death for some slivers of coastline for longer than a year, you read the internal stability reports same as I did." McNamara had been in the Oval Office for about thirty minutes longer than he'd planned, which was to say he'd been in the Oval Office for thirty-five minutes. The second conflict in West Africa this decade was nothing more than the last gasp, the dying words of Democracy in the continent. South Africa was enough. West Africa was too much. West Africa again would cost the Primaries, at least.\n\n"Sir, I think that is an incredibly irresponsible way of looking at a complex geopolitical situation. People are already in an uproar we tried to help the French and lost the first time around, what's to gain from a second time?" The President didn't even flinch at the idea, taking a sip from his mug. "We are spread thin as paper dealing with the Oil Crisis as it is; things are getting bad and they're about to get worse. We cannot afford to spend these valuable resources on a war we've already lost before it began. I suggest you pull out of the consulates, bring what we can, and hit the road while the going is good." Johnson looked back at McNamara, his neutral expression giving way to one of impatience and anger, even if for a split second.\n\n"McNamara, when we first stepped foot into West Africa, we made a promise. A promise to keep the region free, and a promise that all this something wouldn't be for nothing. Now, look at us. We spent God-knows how many lives and guns on the French, and now the PALF is giving us a second shot. This is our last good chance to show the American people that we did something here.""

Liberia and Sierra Leone against the world. Wallace sighed and flicked on the television.\n\n"...fought in West Africa, and see what he has to say." Walter Kronkite and a young man, maybe 30, sat next to each other in leather chairs, the bar along the bottom of the screen declaring the man sitting on the right to be "Frank Evans, Veteran Of West Africa".\n\n"Well, Mr. Kronkite, I think it's goddamned outrageous. I have been fighting for America for the last decade- I've been to Malaya, South Africa, and Cote d'Ivoire, and let me tell you that I've shot and bled and killed enough to have a say. I came into this decade on a draft card, and I intend to leave it with someone new in charge; not someone that'll send me to die in some-" The television dimmed, and Wallace resumed reading over the reports sitting on his desk. Maybe nobody else could see what he saw, but they didn't need to see what Wallace saw, only know that he was making the right decision. If people were getting upset over West Africa being for nothing, then this was their second chance. If de Gaulle wouldn't make the cut, Liberia would need to step up. Of course, there would be the protests, the draft card burners, and the veteran interviews, but there wasn't much else that could be done to convince people that if there would ever be a chance to get a foothold in West Africa, it was this "Mano River pact". Wallace let out a sigh and turned the television back on.\n\n"...already. As the PALF has already made significant grounds, the Liberians may need to establish a defensive line soon, before this turns into a total rout, not unlike the first days of the South African War." Standing in front of a map of the new frontlines, Walter Kronkite gestured towards the Liberian-PALF border."

Of all the ways in which Kennedy had been expecting to shake hands with the French, this was far from how he'd expected it, though given the circumstances he would have preferred it no other way. Taking a seat by the window as the last of the photographers got their shots, Kennedy cleared his throat. "General Massu, I just want to start by saying that I am honored to have you here with us. That, and-" The Frenchman raised his hand.\n\n"We lost, Kennedy. You, me, France, we lost. There is no coming back. It is over, the dream is dead, and I don't even know where de Gaulle might be. Now, the Pan-Africans are setting their sights on what's left that's free. We got more out of the Côte d'Ivoire than we should have, and I can't tell you how many the others got out of the way of that fucking steamroller. We aren't done with the PALF, and they aren't done with us. We can keep our slice of Africa breathing, but only with your help. Is the OFN with us?"\n\nKennedy smile faded, slightly. Glancing up to the reporters, it seemed as though they had been distracted by Scoop Jackson making some kind of a statement on policy towards the Mano River pact. Nobody was listening.\n\n"Listen, Mr. Massu, we tried once before. Think of what we'd be taking on for reelection, the press would kill u-"\n\n"If you don't do this, the fucking PALF will make Liberia look like Burgundy, and that's without anyone around to stop them. Imagine what they're going to do to us exiles; we'd be more welcome at a Europeaniste get-together." Kennedy squinted his eyes. "That's not the point." Massu continued.

With the Oil Crisis striking the Middle East, it has been our responsibility to contain any threats to our national interests and to support our allies in the region. As a result of this... admittedly reckless approach to foreign policy, we have found ourselves stretched thin, and thus unable to maintain some of our pre-existing commitments, specifically with the Mano River pact of Liberia and Sierra Leone. While this comes as a shock to some, we had suspected that the PALF would not be satisfied with its claims following the West African Conflict. With today's declaration of war, it is clear that the Socialist despots have deemed the time ripe to invade our close allies. While ordinarily, we would intervene in the conflict as soon as the option became available, our current geopolitical position has made that especially difficult."\n\nThe cameras of the press in the back rows flickered, and Bennett let out a sigh. What if they lost? He already caught flak for getting into the first West African Conflict, the press would fry him if he tried it twice and lost. Then again, a few losses hadn't exterminated the Warhawks, and they'd eat him alive if he let freedom in West Africa go quietly into the night.\n\n"As a result of this unique set of circumstances, and with the unfavorable state of our military as it stands, I have come to a decision on the subject.""

Another Huey flew overhead. By now, there were at least 40, maybe 50 trips made total since the evacuation had properly begun. From the sounds of things, Washington was shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids, and it was time to get the fuck out of dodge. The ambassador was already halfway across the Atlantic on some carrier that was getting more work done ferrying tag-alongs than planes, and it seemed as though they were practically carrying the Liberian consulate out of the country by its foundations. Footsteps clacked against the asphalt behind him.\n\n"Hey, room for another out here?"

He could barely hear the thuds now, if only because the yelling and hollering around him had long since drowned it out.\n\n"Where in the goddamned hell is Donny?!"\n\n"Don't fucking tell me the furnace is broken! Fix it and get those rat-fucks downstairs to start shredding!"\n\nThe gunfire outside the consulate gates thundered like the countless Hueys that had been running laps from the rooftop to the carrier just outside the bay. Even in spite of everyone yelling into their desktop phones, or scrambling to make their way to or from the basement, everyone froze in place. Like clockwork, Mark saw himself tear himself away from his files, and begin to push his way downstairs with the rest of his floor of bureaucrats and a pair of frazzled guards, both pushing the group up to the roof. The gunfire outside began to dim as the beat of a Huey descended upon the roof. Mark pushed through the crowds racing up the fire escape stairs and saw a line of people sitting on the helipad, as the Huey rose into the sky. Mark hardly registered it, as he pushed through the crowd that bled into the line of despairing accountants and bureaucrats, looking for faces. Aside from the lobby, his floor would have been the last to the roof. Cora worked on the second-highest floor, and God willing, she'd gotten out. Mark watched as the Huey flew to the shore, where there was supposed to be some kind of an evacuation effort.

In my opinion, we've got to intervene before they do."\n\nMassaging his neck, Johnson sighed. His lungs felt hot.

As if Africa wasn't suffering enough, the fragile peace in the western half of the continent was, as of today, shattered as war broke out between the French and their allies and the Cameroonian socialists.\n\nA few years couldn't even pass after the arrival of American troops in South Africa before another crisis enveloped the continent. And, as much as the pacifists and the bad-actors in the Republican-Democrats would rail against him for it, he'd have to intervene. Without American intervention, the whole of western Africa would fall to a rising tide of revolutionary socialism, and the French anaemic colonial army had little hope of standing in its way.\n\nKennedy mused over the issue, feet up on the Resolute desk as he listened to the late-night rain pattering against the windows of the Oval Office. The scumbags on the party's right wing would have a field day with him, the progressive, sending more troops to fight blacks, but what choice was there? It was this or lose Africa to a government only a shade away from outright communism. Perhaps he could spin it as America protecting its pseudo-colony of Liberia, or valiantly stepping in to save their once-allies in the Second World War?\n\nLike everything in politics, there was no easy answer, but he was resolved to do what he knew to be right. Intervention was necessary. An Africa divided between the fascist Italians, the Nazis and a bunch of reds wasn't a future he was interested in seeing.\n\nAs the President reached for the phone, it began ringing.

"Another round?" He inquired, shuffling the deck as he looked across his two newfound friends, a US soldier named Mike and a Belgian mercenary by the name of Bernard.\n\n"If you want to lose everything you just earned, I'd love to." Said Bernard, cracking his trademark grin and striking Pierre cheerfully in the aging French officer's arm. He offered a weak chuckle in return. Mike had been markedly silent, likely due to his poor but workable grasp of French, so he simply managed a 'Oui' paired with a humble smile. Pierre set to dealing out cards, his spirits wavering ever so slightly as his thoughts wandered toward France. The two men, one timid but dedicated and the other bombastic and reckless, reminded him of the men he served with in 1940. His sly grin turned to a wistful frown as he placed the last few cards on the empty ammunition crate they'd been using as a poker table.\n\nThis subtle display of heartbroken nostalgia drew the eye of Mike. Noticing his curious gaze, the old Frenchman began to explain, "Oh, it's nothing. I am just homesick. I long for the day we return to France."\n\n"I... understand. You will, some day, and it will be very good!" Said Mike, his faulty grasp on french apparent in his attempt to provide a false reassurance that Pierre was clearly not buying.\n\n"Yeah! There'll be a parade in Paris and then... then we'll kick their kraut asses out of the east and past Alsace!"

Leroy was getting desperately bored with the silence, his attitude being much different to the others.

Though "translator" was a loaded term, considering the man barely understood Japanese. Still, it was enough. Abba nodded, and explained what they were to the office worker, who nodded and took them away.\n\nThere were still more packages and papers to drop off, so Seiji and Abba continued down the rest of the building, where the same process was repeated. It was far from efficient, and not speaking the language was a problem - but it was done. Now they had at least two more buildings to repeat the same process at.\n\nThe rides were often silent, since neither knew enough of the language of the other to hold a conversation. It would be awkward, if the awkwardness was not so... normal. It seemed to be a common thing - neither the Cameroonians, nor the Japanese really wanted to be here, but pragmatism brought and kept them together.\n\nStill, the more he worked with him, the more he found Abba's presence tolerable. He couldn't do his job without him, and he didn't fill the room every second with pointless chatter. They had an unspoken system which was perhaps not the best, but it worked - and they had a little ritual at the end of the day.\n\nIt was a little bar they went to at the end of a shift. The sight of a Japanese man had drawn some stares the first time, but no longer. Now the two men sharing a drink at the end of the workday was commonplace.

The all-conquering noise of the propellers and engine did not bother Hidemi, a young journalist tasked with documenting the state of war and the beauty of West Africa in photos and print.\n\nThe landscape was occasionally broken up by frontline camps, the remnants of battles, or small towns. As they passed one such camp, he watched an ant-sized PALF soldier glance up at the helicopter and offer a cheerful wave before being beckoned back to work by a superior. Hidemi took care to snap a picture before that happened. The pilot, a man named Aritomo who had become relatively close to Hidemi but had been silent most of the journey, abruptly asked a question. "...How do you think this whole mess is going to end?"\n\n"Huh, well, things are looking pretty good for the PALF."

He winced for the umpteenth time as the collar of his uniform brushed against his sunburned neck, as it had been doing with every heave of the shovel. His mind hosted a mixture of frustration, exhaustion and worry as he silently lamented over his deployment. He'd signed on to do some real good - fighting America's enemies, seeing exotic places and handling the weapons he'd fawned over in comic books as a child and been trained to use in the last few weeks.\n\nInstead, Carter was digging ditches. He was sunburned, drenched with sweat and being eaten alive by the bugs beneath the tall grass and whizzing about the muggy air. That wasn't even the worst part, though. It would be fine, he figured, if he was just digging trenches for a defense, but these trenches were practically this part of the line's only defense.  Usually, when one pictures an American expeditionary force rolling into a foreign country to defend it, one imagines a pristine army at a grand scale packing big guns, backed up by ranks of armor and battling under advanced jets. Then, they'd save the day and leave.\n\nThis wasn't the case, and it didn't just disappoint Carter, it was terrifying. This was going to be a real war, not just an intervention. They had a good chance of victory even still, but it was now apparent to him that they weren't coming to the rescue so much as they were joining the slaughter.

"Hey, I missed my briefing earlier, would you mind giving me a sitrep on well... everything?" Daniel hadn't missed much of the briefing, but had to be removed when all medics were called for an emergency. Still, he was starved for conversation.\n\n"Oh, of course!" Replied the pilot, surprisingly chipper despite the circumstances. Finally, someone was talking to him, he thought to himself, "The situation was... interesting. We, as France, met more and more resistance every day. It is hard, you know? We are alone out here. Although, we had our privileges to make things easier." He spoke stiltedly, as a new English speaker might. Daniel cocked an eyebrow, beckoning the pilot to go on. "Well, France has er... well, we make a web, like a spider. A web of people and places who help us. The Germans bombed us less, the neighbors got... less upset. Life was better, for France."\n\n"Well, this wasn't what I meant by sitrep but, that's helpful.

Back in his day, there were regular forces belonging to nation-states, and there were partisans. The Chinese understood this, even if they understood little else. Presently, however, just this small patch of swamp was a mess of national armies, ideologically-driven partisan organisations, tribal militias and mercenaries with questionable loyalties and alliegences, bandits, 'humanitarian organisations' and panicking civilians across both sides. His orders were to assist the defeat of French exile forces in West Africa, but were even they set in stone? Would they be walking lockstep down Abidjan in a week's time, Kimigayo following La Marseillaise in a long march of madness?\n\nNaturally, such an... unorthodox battlefield would need a competent strategy in order to secure victory, such as it could be called. And Teruzuki had been entrusted to bring it about. The hours had passed, and he had brought himself no closer to a solution. There were just far too many uncertain variables. He didn't know how many of the enemy there were, how many men he could rely on besides the token Japanese force he commanded, how willing his allies would be to do their jobs or listen to him, what side everyone between the national armies would come down on. Far too complex, far too mysterious. It was like walking an army into the proverbial abyss.\n\nAn idea came to him. Of course, if it was this way to the Japanese, it was likely the same to all the other factions at play. The natives might have more of a cultural awareness of the region, but even they had no hope of coherently tracking any of this. This game was not chess orshogi, but mahjong or poker. If nobody knew what they were doing, the one side who acted as if they did was at an advantage. If they didn't waltz right into a trap or an untenable position. But they had to do something, and so it was a risk Teruzuki would have to take, lest he be castigated for doing nothing."

Next had come a slow realisation of the presence of something his half a mind likened to a hornet's nest. Then, he'd felt the alien sensation of nothingness in his leg, replaced soon by searing pain.\n\nThe first sensation that returned to Patrick beyond agony was the blurry sight of asphalt spattered with his own blood. His busted nose throbbed from its collision with the road, his left leg burned with genuine and phantom pain - torn off at the knee, and both his arms were nearly flayed by road burn. The ringing in his ears gave way to muffled shouting of orders, screams of pain, and the staccato rattle of gunfire. It took him a moment to realize he, too, was screaming. Someone hauled him to his foot, supporting him with their shoulder. \n\nAs Patrick slung his gaze up from the ground and saw his unit racing between the squat, bombed out concrete ruins and down the tight streets of a Ghanan city, his memories pieced back together. They were to take the city, but something he couldn't remember had stopped them and his squad and 8 Ghanan militia had found themselves scrambling back to French lines. They had proceeded quietly through the urban jungle, evading ambushes and traps, until... the hornet's nest: An IED, then an ambush.\n\nNow there were only 8 men, dragging him along with them in their hasty retreat along a narrow road towards a blurry french barricade.

Besides, what if they have rocket launchers, or if the Japs gave them some?" Replied the American.\n\n"Send them with escorts, then! I'm not letting my people starve because you don't want to take that risk."

Maybe yes, and maybe not, but it didn't really matter anyway: to him, there weren't any other choices anymore."

Both men had thinned out during their time in West Africa, but on return to Japan, Kane seemed to eat enough to regain his previous body shape. Watching the man dig into his crab legs made Oshan a little more jealous than he cared to admit. His stomach had not quite recovered just yet, and he had opted for a garden salad.\n\n"We were a strange little group, hmm? In my mind, West Africa was like enrolling into university, or some high school. Kane grinned to himself, clicking his teeth together. "Could you see me in any university though?" Oshan thought to himself, and decided no. "Who you still talking to?" Kane asked gruffly between loud bites.\n\n"I sent out a bunch of letters, mostly to the guys we worked with a... bunch."  Oshan temporarily lost himself, staring out one of the restaurant windows, glimpsing a collection of five lights out along the coastline. They were so damn bright... "Anyways, Taiyō never ended up responding, San's working some job in Hokkaido, and I've been calling with Riku, but we recently lost contact."\n\n"Don't put too much thought into it. I'm sure you'll see them again sooner or later." Oshan found himself staring back into the flickering lights. At least three of them had guttered out. "They're a pain, aren't they? What have you been getting up to then, Oshan?"\n\n"Industrial fishing stocktaking. I run myself a little fish storehouse." Oshan answered. "Huh. I'm back working my bureaucracy job again." Kane mopped up the remnants of his crab, shifting the pieces to the right side of his plate. "Now, this is gonna sound... stupid, but it was a nice little war, wasn't it? I don't know, I enjoyed myself a little too much there or something. I said it before, it was like enrolling into school, at least our bit of it.""

The photos, fresh from the darkroom, had turned out well and the young journalist couldn't help but to feel at least a little vain about it. Now was the time to put them together and get a story down on paper, a much more daunting task than one would assume, as a veritable obstacle course of censors stood in his way.\n\nWhat could he write? How can he spin such a gruesome war? He hadn't gotten into this field to lie, as much as he was urged to by his boss, government regulations and the other thousand people and entities who might as well be allowed to barge into his office and look over his shoulder. Hidemi shook his head. He won't lie, he'll just tell the truth creatively, he said to himself. Perhaps the best way, he thought, would be to start with the photos and see which he could work in and which he couldn't. \n\nHe began to rifle through them. The first was an ant-sized PALF soldier waving up at the helicopter Hidemi had hitched a ride in from his play-house sized FOB. That'd be easy to work in, thrown together with some talk of anti-imperialist solidarity and all that sod. Hidemi placed the photo aside, in what would become the 'in' pile. Next, he winced at the graphic image of an American's body laying on either side of a bombed out bunker. Hidemi paused, would this humanize them too much for the censors? He sighed, and started his maybe pile.\n\nAn hour later Hidemi was exhausted and frustrated. His maybe pile was several times the size of his in and out piles, and the latter was still higher than the former. So many of these photos that he prided himself on and that displayed unflinching truth would never be seen by anyone but him. Worse still, he had to work what was left into a functioning story. He sighed, gritted his teeth..."

For months, the cartographer from New York had been traveling through West Africa, chatting with off-duty soldiers and watching beasts roam the landscape. The end of the war in West Africa brought new changes to the region, and the cartographer needed something to write home about.\n\nToday, he had an appointment with the French governor of Ghana to discuss the new political boundaries. The governor, holding his wine glass and smiling, invited George to sit down. The man was acting too casually for his position, George pondered; was Free France not overextended?\n\n"Politically speaking, how is West Africa looking?" George asked, trying to mirror the casual mood of the governor.\n\nWith a chuckle, the governor stood up and led George to the balcony where the two gazed across the dry landscape. "All of our territories have been divided up into different states, each headed by a regional governor. We aren't in a position to exert total control. Not enough troops left," the governor responded quietly.\n\n"You mean it's still all one country? Like America with its federal structure?"\n\n"You may think of it like your America. Each governor has limited control over his territory, but we still have to answer to the national government, of course. Ghana, Mali, Guinea, Dahomey, they are different but it's all French land."\n\nGeorge nodded and wrote something down on his paper. A French Federation of states in West Africa; it was all unified, but the grip felt loose. Just like the early days of America, except it was a different continent. He noticed the governor glancing at him."

  west_african_crisis.217.desc: "Gravel crunched under the wheels of Private Carter Willis's car, crawling its way up the winding 'driveway' of the old family homestead. Through his misty and rain spackled window he could see the old farmhouse standing as it always did, with its cracking white paint laid over the storied wood, its wide form standing stark against the darkening and cloudy sky, and lights in the windows still glowing welcomingly. Carter heaved a grateful sigh as the unparalleled relief of a long awaited end to homesickness and horror washed over him. In turn, he took a deep breath, for he surely would have stories of both drawn out of him over dinner.\n\nShaking away these thoughts, he parked the car and looked to his right at his father's beat up old truck, perhaps with a few more dings than when Carter had gone to war. What a war it had been, he thought to himself as he climbed out, savoring the feeling of stepping through grass in light civilian shoes rather than heavy boots. Mounting the steps, he caught the nostalgic aroma of a freshly cooked dinner sneaking through the closed windows.\n\nCarter still had his old keys, but nobody had to know that, so he knocked and waited until the door swung open to reveal his father's grinning face. About 3 inches taller and 40 pounds heavier than the already tall Carter, the elder Mr. Willis beckoned his son inside. "Welcome home!" He boomed. The rest of the Willises echoed their father's greeting. Mrs. Willis stood up and offered Carter a hug, which he accepted graciously before sitting down with them to dinner.\n\nThe experience was beautiful. He spoke with familiar faces, smelled and tasted familiar food, and listened to familiar laughter. Yet, after the cheers and tearful reunions, there was no mention of the war, no demands for stories or secret news. The Willises seemed disinterested in where Carter had been, simply that he was back, as if he'd been on a work trip and there had been no war. Suddenly, it was simply a family dinner."

  west_african_crisis.218.desc: "West Africa was an enigma to the world, one that the Tokyo National Museum had taken an interest in of late. Kane had prepared himself for the struggle that would be unwrapping it. He had allotted most of his afternoon to his office, gathered every drop of news, both primary and secondary sources, national surveys and Japanese reports of the region, and collated them into a single file.\n\nHe read through newspapers as he ate an office made dinner, he listened to a tape recording while sipping some iced coffee, and watched the single video that he could find while lifting a 30 kilogram weight. The pit of knowledge was endless. West Africa expanded as he delved into it. He brushed the surface and then some, digging away at the various nations that inhabited Sub-Saharan Africa, from the relic shell of the French exiles to the vibrant, evolving culture of Nigeria and its Pan-Africanists.\n\nAs difficult as it was to connect the dots, Kane burnt through his hours eagerly until midnight hit, but still his resolve never wavered. He had begun to produce a product; a timeline from the tribal kingdoms, to the beginnings of colonisation along the coastline, to the massive expansion inland during the late 1800's and then some. He had a continent in his hands, and Kane loved every second of it. This is what it was all about.\n\nFeeling his eyelids beginning to droop, Kane resolved to take a walk outside. His office was located far from the rest of the museum complex, which was convenient. It lay right next to the primary storehouse. He smelt the musky air as he walked the many, dimly lit isles, watching stacks and stacks of forgotten history pass him by. The fresh, brisk air reignited him, and as he walked back from his short journey, he brought to his office a new resolve. West Africa shall not be left rot, and Kane would ensure its legacy would live on."

Kane could hear two of the higher officers arguing. One had finally seen the sense in fleeing, the other was determined to hold the position until orders from their superiors came in. At least he had seen sense to fry the helicopters. All around him were the two men's underlings, all of them anxious to flee. They bickered amongst themselves too, discussing the very same two options as the officers did.\n\n"There are no generals now! We lost, and the best thing for us, us, not them, is to drive to the ports while we still have gas in our tanks and rations to dole out. The Japs will take us into a safer zone. But if we stay longer, there won't be any Japs!" Kane muttered a prayer of thanks to himself as both the officers got into separate vehicles, their radios crackling. He started up the engine pre-emptively, shouting out to the soldiers in the back of his jeep to find their seats. Mere hours ago, Kane had flown helicopters, ferrying equipment and the men who used it to and fro across battlefields and barracks, hospitals and stockpiles. He felt ashamed that he was now ferrying them to an escape.\n\n"They called us in. We're following the head of the convoy to Port Old Oyo." His radio operator had a frantic look in his eyes. Kane could tell that the man was sizing up exactly how far ahead they were in the convoy, weighing up the odds of finding a seat for himself aboard one of the Imperial Navy vessels. Suddenly, he turned to Kane, the frantic look in his eyes making him seem half crazed. "Kane... sir, I need a place on one of those boats, I fucking... I need it, they'll tear me to shreds in a POW camp. Please sir, you're important, right? Ask for us if they can spare us a few seats."\n\nKane opened his mouth to answer, but doubt had seeded itself in his mind. Was he important enough to warrant an extract? He supposed there was only one way to find out."

Three men, celebrating their victory and stifling their remaining chuckles from a previous joke, sat at the bar.\n\n"So, Charlie, where you headed next? A career airman like you, must be hard drifting like that." Said one of them, Greg, while taking a sip of his beer, ice clinking in the glass.\n\nCharles wiped his lips, "Iceland. Honestly, I'm just glad my posting is somewhere I can take my family. Lonely out here, you know?" The other two men nodded.\n\n"Damn straight. Still, I can't imagine just... going through all this, then hopping straight to another far off land. I can't wait to get home and enroll in vet school. How about you, James?"\n\nSeaman Avery, or James, the only non-airforce man among them, was effectively part of their unit after making so many supply runs to this town and having so many drinks in this bar. He glanced over to his compatriots with a smile, "I'll say this, a short tour in Africa isn't gonna stop me from climbing right back into the fray. I'm gonna see the limelight one of these days, just gotta keep my nose to the grindstone. So... somewhere in California, I guess."\n\nGreg chuckled with teasing incredulity, patting James on the back. Charles glanced to his watch with a sigh before standing up and straightening out his uniform. "Well, boys, I've got to get back to base, make sure everything's in order.

He barely even looked at the recommended documents for his engineering degree, instead choosing to read through a novel he had purchased a year ago. Now, he had put page down for screen, watching the flickering screen as his father wielded the controller.\n\n"They put a bunch of crap on these things, don't they?" Anthony Senior wasn't as big a fan of TV as his son had been, nonetheless he sat still, flicking through a series of news channels. He caught a glimpse of a debate focused between an NPP politician and his Republican counterpart, a documentary on the aftermath of the Guyanese intervention and a myriad of other shows too quickly flicked through to understand.\n\nFinally, Anthony Senior landed on an interview, and this time, silently decided to stay there.\n\n"You ended your career in Guyana, correct?"\n\n"Yeah, that's right. The last "good" war it's called nowadays. Swift, sharp, decisive, all the words the generals and their ilk like. They don't tell you we're still in there, they don't tell you Americans are still fighting for our little 'intervention'." He stopped for a second, sipping on his glass of water. "They don't tell you we're still dying."\n\n"Why did you decide to quit the military, Mr Gualtieri?"\n\n"What's the point? We had no business in Guyana, and we have less now.

From binoculars, lighters, gas masks, radio kits and the other weapons of war a militia force required, Kane would seek them out. It was a simple, resource managing job. Almost like banking, he remissed.\n\nAs he filed away his most recent report to his secretary, he couldn't help but wonder what would happen to this portion of the world after he was gone and somebody else took his role. West Africa gobbled up a lot more resources than it produced for Japan, a fact the corporations of his homeland knew very well.\n\nStaring out over the army barracks, Kane decided to tuck that little thought away. He had no business questioning the morals of his operation. His job was little more than to ensure that the men he took charge of had a weapon in their hands and a full belly while holding it.

After hours working in a morgue, the sterile brightness of a medical facility and its intense feeling of mortality tends to ruin one's taste for bright light. No, Shuichi was happy with his little desk lamp fending off the evening's darkness.\n\nCharting the dead was not only a demoralizing experience, but a mind numbingly boring one. The first hour a week ago when Shuichi had signed on to remain behind and help count the dead was frightening and tragic, but eventually the names, causes of death and other minutae began to blur until they were simply squiggles on a page to be transferred to a letter and sent off. Jotting yet another scribble down, Shuichi took a sip of his tea and winced. While he was grateful for the Cameroonian's hospitality, giving him room and board so long after the withdrawal, their tea was terrible.\n\nShuichi nearly chuckled to himself. Why did he take this job? He could be at home with his family, sipping real tea, and reading a book. It was absurd to have volunteered to stay back to count the dead and it was even more absurd that his only complaint was boredom and foul tea. Shaking his head, he reassured himself that the pay would be worth it.\n\nSuddenly, Shuichi's eyes fell upon a familiar name in the sea of casualty reports. Imada Taro. He didn't recognize the name Imada, but the name Taro chilled his bones. It was his brother's name. Shuichi knew for sure that this Taro was not his brother, yet he could not help but wonder who's brother this man was. All of these names, once scribbles but quickly fading back into legibility, were suddenly much more humanized. Shuichi rubbed his nose and shook back to reality, jotting the cause of death - landmine. He finished the letter, then flicked to the next, someone else's brother. Private Yamada Ichiro, artillery blast. He wrote another letter."

He gestured idly with his spoon towards the television as it displayed a glamor shot of a Free French bombardment. "We have no truck with this one. It ain't even France the Cameroons are fighting, but just a buncha lost soldiers in Africa."\n\n"People are worried Howard, we all know what happened last time fighting started up in Africa, folks wanna know if we're going in for round two." Judith pointed out before retrieving a bowl of her own stew.\n\n"Those were Nazis, Judith. No one has a problem with killing Nazis." Howard opened his mouth to continue, but Judith interjected again.\n\n"Except for Lionel, you know, down the street? He had a lotta problems with killing Nazis when that whole thing started."\n\nHoward sighed. "Yes, except for Lionel. Point is, whatever that fight became, it started out in a good place. Y'know.
