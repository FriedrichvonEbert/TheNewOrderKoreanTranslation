 USA_OFN_kickstart_media_desc:0 "Times have changed, and in our new American society, the President does not have as much influence over his people as he would like.

Even if the war is only a regional conflict, our folks at home are not very happy about another war in foreign land. We have been picking up reports of German crimes being committed in South Africa; if we exaggerate these tales enough, we will be able to get the support we need.

 USA_OFN_a_necessary_war_desc:0 "This war must be fought! If we don't bring the war to the Nazi-fucks down in Africa, they will eventually bring the war to us on their terms, and we cannot have that happen. The war is necessary to secure the future of South Africa and keep the Eastern route to Asia safe. It is necessary because if we don't have safe ways to Asia, we sure as hell will lose future opportunities to increase our influences in Asia"

 #New Nixon Events
 USA.ct.1.t:0 "금이 가는 유럽의 요새"
 USA.ct.1.desc:0 "President Nixon stared at the world map projected onto a screen in the White House briefing room. At the center was America, encircled, facing the Japanese and their colonial minions to the West and the Germans and their slave empire to the East. \n\nBut where the Japanese and the Americans had only recently escaped Armageddon's embrace in Hawaii, the Nazi empire was fraying at its seams. Hitler grew older and more infirm by the day; no amount of clever camera work and pre-recorded speeches could hide his creaking gait, his once-mesmerising oratory shrunken into senile rambling. Germany's moon landing was not a triumph - it was an epitaph. \n\nSecretary of Defense Melvin Laird looked up from the latest CIA intelligence brief on the German Reich. "It's a house of cards, Mr. President. Britain chafes under a foreign occupier, Brittany already deals with us in secret, and the Norwegians continue to resist decades of occupation. And their African colonies will wither on the vine without support." \n\n"All held together by a man who can't finish a sentence without forgetting how it started," Nixon noted. \n\n"When Hitler goes, his successors will fall over themselves to split the spoils, like Alexander's generals did in antiquity." Laird handed over a sheaf of documents from the CIA folder. "It's the opportunity of a lifetime. We'll never get another shot at crippling the Nazis like this.""
 USA.ct.1.a:0 "구세계로 다시 돌아갈 시기이다."
 USA.ct.2.t:0 "The South African Tango"
 USA.ct.2.desc:0 "Secretary of State William Rogers was well familiar with the steps of the 'South African Tango'. The South African ambassador would ask in vague generalities about admission into the OFN, but without any real plans for common defense or tariff liberalization. The Secretary would, in turn, respond with vague updates on South Africa's application, now nearly a decade old. \n\nIt suited both parties; the South Africans wanted the threat of OFN membership to cow the Germans, and the OFN needed to preserve the last democracy in Africa. Neither, however, wanted a German intervention, which OFN membership could provoke. Thus, the South African Tango continued on, without end. \n\n"How can I help you today, Ambassador?" Roger struck a neutral tone to hide his boredom; he was near-certain that the response would be entirely predictable. "We're doing very well, and about that OFN application" would be the usual response -- \n\n"The Germans are making their move." Ambassador Willem Christiaan Naude declared. "Hertzog's Boer nationalists are talking to the Germans. South Africa is in danger, and we need America's help." \n\nThat got Roger's attention, as his stomach dropped at this most unexpected turn in the decade-long discourse. "What kind of help are we talking about?" \n\n"Financial, intelligence, but above all, military." Naude said firmly. "If the Boers and Germans want a fight, we won't make it easy for them.""

 USA_sen_bill.102.d_passed:0 "It was an entirely innocuous phone call to the Oval Office from Capitol Hill. "The budget's gone through, Mr. President. I hope we're not making a mistake, reaching out to - " \n\n "The Europeans, yes. We'll take care of it from here," Nixon replied brusquely before pressing his hand down on the receiver. Pressing the headset to his ear, he hurriedly dialed in a second number, and waited. \n\n"Director? You'll have your funds." Nixon hunched over the desk, flipping through the latest estimates from the CIA. "Yes, backchannel contacts with our consulate in Brest, filtering literature to the students in the universities, the works." \n\nA quiet moment. "And yes, yes, the weapons too. But that - that needs to be deniable. All through Brittany, and all surplus. Nothing new. Nothing that can be tied back to us. Speer wouldn't appreciate his enemies knowing we were arming his students." \n\nA final pause, followed by a nod, then the clang of the headset returning to the receiver. The funds began to be wired to the CIA's contacts in Brittany not thirty minutes later."
 USA_sen_bill.102.d_failed:0 "It was hard to imagine anything that would cause the R-D's to join with the NPP in opposition to their own President. Hell, Nixon had counted on it. Would his party really want to hold hands with those ideologically adulterous political nutcases? \n\nAs it turned out, when it came to reaching out to Nazi Germany, they would. \n\nNever mind that the intent was to support the one German who wasn't reflexively hostile to American interests. Never mind that taming Germany politically would let America focus on Japan. Never mind that yes, everything would need to be kept hush-hush, since anything overt would kill any chance of Speer's succession. \n\nNo, it had turned out that America was nowhere near ready for that kind of hardheaded foreign policy. The NPP called him a traitor, the Democrats called him nuts, and his own Republicans were calling him misguided. The same people who had lauded Kennedy as a hero for preserving the status quo in Hawaii were deriding Nixon as a fool for trying to seize upon the weaknesses of America's enemies. \n\nNixon fumed, pouring himself a shot of whiskey from the bottle kept under the desk. The shortsightedness, the partisanship, the sheer hypocrisy! It would make anyone want a drink, propriety be damned."

 USA_sen_bill_name_103:0 "Foreign Intelligence Operations Budget"
 USA_sen_bill_desc_103:0 "If the plan to back Albert Speer with American intelligence assets is to have any teeth, we'll need the funds to make it happen - more than what we can reasonably allocate from the intelligence community's current budget. We'll have to approach Congress to ask for the required funding, with key Congressional leaders briefed about the actual uses of the funds. Whether they agree with us - and work to get the budget passed - is another matter."

 USA_sen_bill_name_102:0 "민권법"
 USA_sen_bill_desc_102:0 "The immense backlash to the Wallace administration has all but ensured that civil rights is a no-brainer in American politics, and as such, we have the opportunity to pass a Civil Rights Act of our own.  This law would officially ban segregation nationwide, desegregate the armed forces, and institute a series of voting rights protections, to be enforced by the Department of Justice.  While some on the far right are loudly protesting this act, nobody listens to them much anymore.  If this law passes, it would be clear that the United States of America has left the shadow of George Wallace's paeans to "states' rights", and is entering the bright sunshine of human rights."

 RD_D_compromise_a_103:0 "Country over party, gentlemen!"
 RD_D_compromise_b_103:0 "We won't fall on our swords for Nixon's sake!"
 RD_D_compromise_desc_103:0 "Some days, Vice-President John F. Kennedy hated his job. It wasn't just because President Nixon was a mercurial, ornery bastard. No, it was because sometimes Nixon would saddle Kennedy with the dirty work - to risk his reputation to save the President's. Now, not a year after talking the Japanese down, the President wanted to bankroll the Nazis ('but only the nice ones'), and Kennedy would talk the Democrats into supporting it. \n\nAs expected, Wallace F. Bennett and Al Gore Sr. both stared at Kennedy like he'd grown a second head. \n\n"Jesus, Jack!" Gore finally exclaimed. "You know your dad's reputation is still in the gutter over the war. How can you be okay with this?" \n\n"The president sure has it out for you after Hawaii," Bennett remarked. "But we're still being dragged down over losing the war. If this goes public, we'll be wiped out politically." \n\nThe comments stung deeply, but Kennedy made his pitch regardless. "Germany's rotting from the inside. We put Speer in power, and Germany will be in chaos as the various cliques fight him tooth and nail. We're doing this to end Germany, not help it!" \n\nAfter a long silence, Bennett spoke. "Even if you convince us, what about the rest of the caucus? We could be looking at another set of defections to the NPP. Can we afford that?""

 RD_R_compromise_desc_103:0 "An uncomfortable silence settled in the Oval Office as soon as Nixon outlined his plan to covertly support Albert Speer in the impending succession crisis in Germany. Lyndon B. Johnson and Nelson Rockefeller looked at each other worriedly. \n\n"Let me get this straight," Rockefeller said incredulously. "You want to use taxpayer money to covertly support a leading figure in the Nazi party? Not the British resistance, or the Russian warlords, but the Nazis?" \n\n"When Nelson puts it that way, it sounds like you're losing your marbles, Richard." Johnson drawled. "Hard to believe you're the same guy who put the screws to the German-American Bund with McCarthy years ago." \n\n"Just listen, damnit!" Nixon growled. "Speer's the only candidate to succeed Hitler who's even remotely inclined to talk to us. We get him into office, we can string Germany along with promises of lifting the embargo, so we can focus on Japan. His student radicals will keep Speer too busy to cause trouble. This isn't a threat; it's an opportunity." \n\nAnother worried silence. "If you really want this to happen, we can get the caucus to fall in line." Johnson finally said. "But it'll be a helluva fight getting everyone to agree to this. Hell, you might have people jump ship like Margaret Chase Smith did.""

Along its length rose a string of watchtowers, seawalls and concertina wire, their seams held together by trillions of Reichsmarks and the Führer's Aryan will. This stranglehold over the Old World goes by deceptive names like the Einheitspakt and Fortress Europa. The Free World calls it for what it is: a Steel Curtain.\n\nThe Volkshalle would have one believe that the Steel Curtain is as the Gibraltar Dam: impregnable, insurmountable, everlasting. In truth, the Curtain is pregnant with rot, surmounted by power struggles, and frail on its deathbed -- much like its architect Hitler. Subtle blows can make gaps out of its rustiest sections; there liberty's torchlight can filter back into the continent afresh."

They also assumed the German government had held true to its promises thereafter. Moreover, they assumed the German army had no business prevailing against the combined forces of two world empires, and that they will fold in a second war as they had in the first.\n\nGermany proved them wrong on all three accounts by raising the swastika over Paris and London. On that ignoble climax has America since been forced to leave its Allies' governments to Hitler's mercy.\n\nOperative word, says the CIA: governments. With an appropriately sized black budget, the Allies' restive peoples will be forgotten no longer."

Luckily, a force which can effect such exists in Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. President Nixon pledges to uphold the Special Relationship both before and when America's other plays its hand."

Free England's fighters harbor their own visions for the nation's future -- proaction now, President Nixon's advisers suggest, will guarantee the inevitable power struggle's prevailing vision comporting comfortably to the Free World's own course.\n\nOne of the resistance's most agreeable factionheads also stands out as its most surprising: English Army general Claude Auchinleck. How India's former commander-in-chief has hidden his duplicity from London is a mystery; in any case, the man regaled Langley's contacts with fond recollections of America's valiant defense against Sealion. That, and a promise that Parliament will more formally parley with the OFN once the current situation is resolved."

What, one may ask, will an assemblage of angry men do with weapons brought free of charge from a land which only has too many for itself?\n\nThe answer might surprise.

The Germanic peoples' shared destiny, in Germania's presumable fever dreams, supersedes queries laden with common sense such as "How many Norwegians buy their tripe?" and "How many Germans would give their lives for Oslo?"\n\nThere at least exists an answer to the first question.

By now a whole generation of Europeans have been taught that free will and the rights of man are assumptions, rather than the principal axioms which they are. Fascism's stain on Europe's ancient societies will linger for decades before it fades away -- if it ever fades at all.\n\nBut no volume of Nazi indoctrination can excise man's impulse to seek the illicit: the unknown, made alluring by its forbidden nature. How far the world has strayed that common decency is merely an exotic import to the Reich's citizenry... but they yearn for it regardless. America will give them however much of it they wish to consume through Brittany's unfettered ports."

As arms shipments adopt tight schedules without authorities' notice and agents slip into and out of Fortress Europa with a revolving door's ease, the two countries' resistances ask Washington's leave to form closer ties with The Company.\n\nFor his part, President Nixon recalls the OSS's legendary exploits in its short-lived record.

Though the inevitable power struggle's severity had caught Capitol Hill off guard, America must still issue a formal response to Europe's latest crisis. Deadlock has unsurprisingly arisen over what said response should be.\n\nTo both parties' outrage, President Nixon suggests offering diplomatic recognition to Albert Speer. The noted reformist may ultimately be a Nazi, he defends, but no better opportunity to steer Germany from its excesses exists than in his accession as the Reich's new Führer. If nothing else, Speer seems more receptive of peace and cooperation than Göring, Bormann, and Heydrich.\n\nAmerica's eyes are on Capitol Hill as its statesmen-elect decide whether to fan the embers of German liberalism... or watch idly by as it turns to ash."

Like Hercules, its armies and fleets ventured towards the continent's westernmost edge to wrest wealth and glory from Europe's giants. Like Hercules, they halted at a body of water, in this case the River Ganges, and ventured no further.\n\nBut unlike Hercules, they feasted merrily on their spoils for years hence. Now even grasping its empire's edges has become a Herculean labor for Tokyo's corpulent digits.

To say that the situation of the Republican-Democrats is dire would be the understatement of the century. Enter former Speaker of the House John McCormack, a man who never expected to hold the reins of power who has regardless found them thrust into his hands. At such a dark moment in America's history, McCormack will certainly have his work cut out for him.\n\nWith the election approaching, McCormack's tenure as President will be short. He has no intentions of running in the election, instead simply resolving to hold the Oval Office for the coming months until a new Commander-in-Chief can be nominated. However, with his party in shambles and the National Progressive Party making unprecedented gains, he intends to use his brief tenure to try and right the ship and save the Republican-Democrats from ruin.\n\nThe tarnished legacy of Nixon will need to be addressed, a matter President Kennedy was unable to attend to in his tragically brief rule. The fallout of the South Africa War that Nixon thrust the country into will need to be carefully managed as well. If McCormack can successfully put out the flames that his party is currently engulfed in and restore some semblance of dignity to the government, the Republican-Democratic party may just manage to pull through - or at the very least, survive absolute electoral decimation."

The delicate art of mediating between two rival parties requires a certain level of detachment from the inner goings on of both.\n\nAs President, McCormack could use the prestige of his old position to his advantage. By presenting himself as a non-partisan element, uninvolved in the unfortunate scandals of the past, McCormack can distance himself from the taint of the Nixon presidency.

Then Nixon lied and Kennedy died, and suddenly this Boston-born son of a hod carrier found himself thrust into the highest office in the land.\n\nThe days seemed to blur together as he struggled to gather himself. The Oval Office was a whirlwind of activity, endless lines of politicians and secretaries rushing to give him the lay of the land. "More rioting in the South" cried one. "Latest casualty reports from South Africa, Mr President" said another. The podium at the press conferences was another beast. He had lost count of the amount of times he had uttered the phrases "national tragedy" and "difficult times for us all" in front of flashing cameras over the last few days. Finally, whenever he found himself a brief moment to relax, he would pick up the newspaper and read all about the grim poll forecasts and the endless rumor mill and the countless reports of anti-war protests and continuing civil rights clashes and lines of coffins returning from overseas.\n\nOne night, sleep truly eluded him, and he found himself in the Oval Office, sitting in darkness save only for the lights flooding in from the White House lawn. His presidency would not be a successful one. He accepted that. He made no plans to run in the election to try and legitimize or extend his rule.

McCormack promised swift offensives, influxes of support equipment, various dates by which Quelimane and Luanda would surely be in American hands, and many other bold suggestions. The reporters asked tough questions - how would this effect the economy? Could the soldiers hope to cross such vast distances in such a short time? How would such an offensive affect the wellbeing of the men? The claims flowed freely, and the questions came back even firmer, for what seemed like hours.\n\nAfterwards, McCormack found himself only able to hope that his words would sway the public back. A quick end to the war would not only free the party from the indignity of having declared it, but also allow them to bask in the great victory over fascism that would arise from it.

Newspapers, stat sheets, comuniques from all across the country; the contents of the papers were varied, but on each of them he had circled the particular stats he was looking for - the polls.\n\nThe New York Times said the R-Ds stood a good chance in Iowa, while the Boston Globe predicted a bloodbath in the NPP's favor. Pollsters in Illinois seemed confident that the Republican senator there would keep his seat, but the news from Louisiana was not so encouraging. Endlessly, McCormack gorged himself on poll numbers, feeling his heart sink at every poor showing and subsequently soar at every promising result.\n\nYet he felt himself growing increasingly frustrated as the pollsters seemed incapable of agreeing with one another, and the final result remained as unclear as ever. The uncertainty made him feel sick to his stomach. He knew he hadn't always made the right choices, and the NPP were stronger now than they had ever been before. Nixon and Kennedy were the reason he was in this mess, yet history would remember him as the man who made or broke the Republican Democrats.\n\nAs the night wore on, and the official vote counts began, McCormack felt his eyelids begin to droop.

Now, however, ballistic missiles fly far higher and faster than even the fastest jets, and as a result, can no longer be countered conventionally.\n\nAs a solution, the Department of Defense has envisioned the Sentinel Program. In it, a series of low-range, anti-ballistic missile sites will be placed around the continental United States. If enemy missiles come nearby, these sites will fire guided missiles in response to intercept and destroy them.

The American Military has yet to fully adopt the ideas learned from the Second World War, that maneuver and speed are the way of the future. As of right now, that changes. America will no longer be on the backfoot in tactics and strategy; rather, it will rush ahead with new, innovative combat concepts that will put it at the forefront of military doctrine. Among these innovations are helicopter-focused infantry, highly mobile ground units to outflank and surround enemy positions, and advanced naval detection technology and protocols. America has seen the future of warfare, and the future is American."

While economic progress was seen at the start, soon it was clear that the rich were only getting richer, the middle class saw a tiny bump, and the poor saw next to no progress, and even a regression as government budgets were stretched.

However, Bennett's idea of trade was to move high paying manufacturing jobs from America's great cities to areas of the world that had weak unions, little protections and no need to pay their workers much above subsistence levels, and then selling what was made back to America. While this made the big companies that still owned the factories and the distribution methods rich, and helped those countries bolster their economies, it put thousands out of work here at home, and rippled through the American economy. We should rectify this balance, encourage the companies to return home and employ our citizens, even if it does make our friends and allies angry."

More guns, more bullets, some surplus vehicles for their security forces, and money to hire new police thugs. Filipino industries can make cheap goods for Sphere markets, but their defense sector is practically nonexistent. Besides, it would hardly even qualify as a line item in our ministry budgets."

 USA.1913.desc:0 "WASHINGTON (AP)-President Richard Nixon met with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru at the White House today. The meeting, the first between Nixon and Nehru, was the first stop on the Prime Minister's visit to the United States, soon to be followed by multiple stops in Washington, Virginia, and New York. At the Oval Office, President Nixon reaffirmed America's commitment to deepening America's political and economic ties to India.\n\n"India is a vast nation, blessed with a multitude of resources and a rising population. It is the belief of this administration that the United States of America would be foolish if we did not embrace your republic, and all the opportunities that it offers the world."\n\nFollowing the President's remarks, Prime Minister Nehru returned with cordiality of his own.\n\n"The people of India are on the verge of great success in the fields of economics, societal progress, and national development. We wish to use this success to join hands with the free world, and I would like to thank the President for his efforts to bring our nations closer together.""

Get them bogged down in a new jungle war, and they'll feel the pain." \n\nPresident Nixon nods carefully, considering his advisor's comments. "Alright, Bob. Go on." \n\nOne of McNamara's aides walks up with a pair of rolled-up maps. Each one bears a detailed map of a Southeast Asian country. "Two of the largest potential targets are Indonesia and the Philippines. Indonesia is both a literal and political archipelago, riven by Japanese resource extraction, military regimes, and native collaborators. Meanwhile, the Philippines is a rebellious nation, as we know well, and the population is believed to be very resentful of their occupiers. Both countries have active rebel groups which we could use as proxies against Tokyo." \n\nNixon presses his hands together in a gesture of contemplation, staring at the black and red markings that dot the maps. "Okay, Bob. What form would this proxy warfare be taking?" \n\nMcNamara's aides pull out more maps, more lists, more explanations. And over the course of the morning, a bloody strategy to drive new knives into the Empire of Japan takes form."

Such a contrast to when he held fiery speeches in front of thousands, and spearheaded negotiations that led to the eventual peace that descended upon the Einheitspakt. Even with his boundless optimism, he was worried.\n\nBrandt knew that he could never step foot into Germany again. He was a man in exile; forever destined to be cast out for his actions, punished when justice was a degraded and humiliated concept. Yet he did not feel shame, or guilt, or anger. Brandt's only concern remained with the future at large.\n\nWould Germany relent, shedding its bloodied history of the past few decades and embrace what had made it so strong, or would it falter, and remain prey to the forces that wished to doom everyone to the darkness of fascism?"

It had better not be, you told me there would be no hang ups on that issue."\n\n"Not at all, Mister President," McNamara shifted slightly in his seat. "The Director of Central Intelligence actually asked me to have you convene the council." He glanced to the director, who held a pipe to his lips, his mouth curled into a glib smile.\n\n"Get on with it, then." the president urged. With a puff of smoke, he leaned in and began.\n\n"Mister President, we have contacts high up within the German colonial administration in Madagascar. We have total reason to believe that they have some ... misgivings about their loyalties to Berlin. With the weakening of the German empire, and with Hitler becoming increasingly ill, it's become apparent that a conflict may break out on the island sooner rather than later. We have word that rebels are planning to make their move soon, and the local government is divided."\n\nNixon shrugged. "Who are these contacts? Can we be sure of their sincerity?" McNamara pushed his glasses further up his nose; for dramatic effect, the director puffed again from his pipe. "Mister President, our contact is Reich Commissar Emil Maurice."\n\nNixon seemed stunned for a moment, but collected himself quickly. "My God, that's great. And he has a direct line to Hitler?" The director nodded. "Maurice is one of Hitler's oldest confidants. Their relationship has been strained as of late -- which is partly why he wants out -- and his word, we think, is good." Nixon nodded in silence for several moments before continuing.\n\n"Well, dammit, keep me updated on this. If you find any way to breach the bastion, you let me know immediately.""

 USA.madagascar.2.desc:0 ""Mister President, we believe the dam is about to burst in Madagascar."\n\nMaurice wanted out. The perfect storm of pressures and crises seemed about ready to completely tear the Indian Ocean island apart. The president sat down in his chair, switching the phone to his left hand as he shifted through some papers on his desk. "What's going on? I haven't had any information in my daily briefings on the issue. The last I heard was when we spoke right after we lifted that blockade."\n\n"Well, Mister President, there is a pandemic of black plague across the countryside. The Jews in the North are getting uppity, so to say, especially because of the chaos back in the mother country. SS units across the island have been in constant contact with Himmler and his underlings. Maurice is terrified he may be shot any day by his own guards. And the natives may revolt soon, as well. For what it's worth, we agree with his assessment that Madagascar is about to become a warzone."\n\nA perfect storm, alright. "Well, give it to me straight. What are our options? Realistically speaking, that is."\n\n"Well, Mister President, you have two realistic options. The Agency can affect the delivery of several crates of weapons -- rifles, grenades, pistols, the like -- for Maurice to hand out to his loyalists. The other option is to simply hand him a lump sum of money. He can then use that sum for bribery, or purchases of his own, or what have you.""

 USA.madagascar.2.ab:0 "Money makes the world go 'round."

 USA.madagascar.3.t:0 "Shalom auf Madagaskar!"
 USA.madagascar.3.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported the final victory of the Jewish partisan movement on Madagascar. A local militia commander, near the city center of Toamasina, was quoted as saying that their success was "just the first of many plans of revenge" for the horrors of previous decades.\n\nChaos still reigns in many parts of the island as what remaining German loyalists flee or go into hiding. As the beginnings of a proper government begin to form, however, there is light at the end of the tunnel. The Director of Central Intelligence is upset over the outcome. For his part, President Nixon is quietly annoyed, but publicly exuberant. A reporter for CBS News quoted an aide of the president as being "excited for the possibilities of a free Madagascar in the future," and hailing "the beginning of the end of global fascist terror."\n\nStill, few Americans even know what a Madagascar is, much less understand the complexities of the issues that have led to this moment."
 USA.madagascar.3.a:0 "It could have been worse, I guess."

 USA.madagascar.4.t:0 "The German Loyalists Hold The Line"
 USA.madagascar.4.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported a seemingly final victory for the German garrison on Madagascar. Large convoys of trucks, loaded with captured militiamen, partisans, and suspected collaborators and sympathizers -- Jewish, natives, and others alike -- are photographed and filmed on their way into the countryside -- where their fate is unknown.\n\nEven despite the German victory, chaos still reigns in many parts of the country. Command hierarchy among the troops suffers greatly the further from the capital one goes, with revenge killings and attacks carried out on unsuspecting civilians and villages -- regardless of their true or suspected sympathies. It will take a great deal of time for the economy to recover, as well. The scars of war are never fully healed.\n\nThe White House has issued a statement hammering "Nazi tyranny" and has declared its intention to double its efforts in combating "global fascist terror". The bellicose rhetoric hasn't inspired any responses of note from Germany or Japan, and whether the president's statement is true or not remains to be seen. For now, Madagascar will remain under foreign domination, its people exploited and oppressed in the name of the glory of the Third Reich."
 USA.madagascar.4.a:0 "Another blow to liberty -- and the CIA."

 USA.madagascar.5.t:0 "A Crushing Victory"
 USA.madagascar.5.desc:0 ""Mister President, we've achieved a crushing victory! Our boys in Madagascar have won."\n\nSomething of an overstatement, [GetPresidentLastName] thought. He really preferred these phone conversations over meeting the man in person -- but now, he was growing tired even of this. "Yes, director. Congratulations on your operation. You did a hell of a job." Madagascar was now under OFN jurisdiction for the time being -- and hopefully would stay that way. But there were many questions of the future that remained to be answered.\n\n"No, Mister President, the success is all yours." There was an awkward pause. "Your statement to that reporter earlier today was very nice, if I do say so myself."\n\nNo shit, the president thought. "Yes, thank you. I think it's important we continually reinforce our intentions to support a transition to democracy. That's why we got involved in the first place, after all."\n\n"Yes, very good, Mister President," the director said. "With any luck, this is just the first of many great victories under this administration.""
 USA.madagascar.5.a:0 "Perhaps not a crushing victory, but a victory nonetheless."

 USA.madagascar.6.t:0 "Masters of Their Own House"
 USA.madagascar.6.desc:0 "Today international observers have reported a final victory for the native militias and rebel brigades on Madagascar. Flags of the colonial regime and of German are trampled and spat upon, torn to bits, and lit on fire; statues toppled; government collaborators beaten to within an inch of their lives or outright killed; and public monuments and government buildings defaced. For the first time since the 19th century, Madagascar is free.\n\nThe first pillars of the so-called Madagascarian Republic have been erected. Soon, tranquility, law, and peace will return to the island -- or so many hope. Of course, the result isn't exactly what the CIA or the president's closest allies hoped for, but a free people strongly opposed to German domination is a good friend, indeed.\n\nPresident [GetPresidentLastName], however, is wary. He remembers the crisis that gripped Guyana in its slide toward autocracy; in some ways, he sees similarities in the creation of the independent Madagascarian government. Only time may tell, however, whether Madagascar will truly embrace freedom."
 USA.madagascar.6.a:0 "We welcome the people of Madagascar into the concert of free nations."

 USA.madagascar.7.t:0 "Liberty Leading the People Again"
 USA.madagascar.7.desc:0 "The powers of the great coalitions and alliances of human history have always weighed back and forth like a great scale. And now, as the Unitypakt stumbled, OFN chose to strike at the opportune moment.\n\nAt the president's direction, and with significant monetary assistance from the State Department, the United Coalition Government of Madagascar, a sort of stop-gap measure, has been established. The endgoal of the intervention is the creation of an OFN-friendly sovereign government, completely free from German and Nazi influence. So far, the effort seems to have been successful.\n\nFuture politics is largely put aside in the name of total unity and opposition against the Germans and their agents. It will certainly not last, but for now there is stability among the friends to America and its OFN allies."
 USA.madagascar.7.a:0 "Once more, unto the breach."

USA_reach_out_to_Riyadh_desc:0 "Saudi Arabia holds more cheap oil than any other nation on Earth. Miles of oil wells have stuck out of its dunes for decades, pumping millions of barrels of liquid gold a day. Italian colonialism expanded these lucrative fields to new plays underneath both the desert sands and the Persian Gulf. In a twist of irony, the Arabian Desert is now an oasis for a planet famished for oil.\n\nThe President's advisors unanimously believe King Faisal is America's ticket out of the Oil Crisis. However, its ideal method of approach is still subject to debate. Some believe Arabia needs firm reassurances from the Free World, up to and especially a tour de force. Conversely, others warn of the risks involved in repeating the South African and Indonesian debacles, instead advocating for diplomacy and more... clandestine, means to support the monarch."
USA_Securing_Our_Interests_desc:0 "America runs a race against an oil market on the brink of freefall; if it fails, then so too will its economy. In these precarious circumstances, mistakes made of haste are more easily forgiven if they ultimately preserve the country's fortunes.\n\nWashington is sure to make plenty of mistakes by intervening overtly in the Arabian peninsula, to say nothing of the political capital it needs to convince Congress and the people in favor of another foreign adventure. Rest easy knowing that the sacrifices we make now will pay off for millions of Americans' lives decades into the future. Prosperity, after all, makes forgiveness an easy choice."
USA_Gifts_For_The_King_desc:0 "King Faisal holds sway over a nation-state's embryo. He may have government, culture, recognition and rule of law - but without the guns to back its monopoly on violence, his dynasty may as well be one more tribe among the Arabian peninsula's lawless bedouins. More specifically, Bedouins vulnerable to the nationalistic overtures of a united Arab identity.\n\nHere America can leverage its economic largesse to buttress the young nation's precarious position. A shipment of guns both outdated and state-of-the-art will assure the King of his state's lastingness in the face of a subcontinent's worth of foes."
USA_King_Faisal_Im_CIA_desc:0 "The fruits of human intelligence compound with every year they operate within a country's borders. In turn, a well-established intelligence apparatus both forewarns and precludes enemy action, sometimes without their knowledge.\n\nWhich is why the CIA is so eager to expand their operations in the Middle East as of late. Our stiletto in the dark needs ample preparation time to conduct their covert deeds - we can satisfy their demands by sending them into the region before our armed forces. The Company will wreak their infamous havoc where we need it most soon enough."
USA_Operation_Sandstorm_desc:0 "As of late, the Joint Chiefs of Staff busied themselves with preparing America's most comprehensive expeditionary force since Indonesia. Drawing from the lessons learned in the past decade's two largest wars, the country's finest generals and admirals drew minute, extensive plans for a lightning war involving all four branches of the US Armed Forces. They described the immense firepower America's tanks, guns, ships and planes combined will demonstrate as a "shock and awe campaign" spanning the Middle East, routinely inspected for any flaws that may lead to another quagmire.\n\nAll told, the Pentagon assured America that Sandstorm will promise just that: a storm. Woe betide the fools who bar its path."
USA_Step_Up_Our_Shipments_desc:0 "Our army lives and dies by supply routes thousands of miles astride the East Coast and the Persian Gulf. As their principal supplier, said supply routes likewise dictate the Royal Saudi Land Forces' shape, tempo and effectiveness. Heavier combat necessitates several thousands more tons of shipment sent per day; should our logistics fail to meet the armies' demands, we will likely see both their ammunition and morale plummet deep enough to hit a reservoir of oil.\n\nThe simple solution is to increase the pace of convoys running extant routes. We can always rely on our capable merchant marine to implement this directive to their abilities' best."
USA_Black_Gold_Rush_desc:0 "One immeasurable benefit of direct cooperation with Saudi Arabia is direct access to their pipelines bursting full with oil. Their generosity has thus far ably stemmed the bleeding on America's economy since the Oil Crisis began. With war on their doorstep, and the US Army their most stalwart shield against it, the Saudis believe dedicating some of their valuable pumps solely for our army's consumption - after their extracts leave the refineries, of course - will service both themselves and us in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nReally, who are we to disagree?"
USA_Pick_Your_Targets_desc:0 "The CIA's contacts have proven their worth by providing every last iota of intelligence they can gather about our adversaries' leaders. Blueprints, photographs, sensitive documents, and even hearsay all blended into coherent narratives and routines involving the Middle East's most famous and infamous. The lax environments their abodes exhibit would scream danger to our agents - were they tasked with protecting them. Instead, the CIA saw only chances gaping wide open.\n\nWith the leaders' lives laid bare before the Company's omnipresent eyes, certain personages believe now is the most opportune time to plunge our stiletto in the dark behind their backs."
USA_Finding_Their_Leaders_desc:0 "Pan-Arabism is a mass movement, with its corresponding strengths, weaknesses, and weaknesses disguised as strengths. In particular, the ideology has mobilized millions throughout the Middle East around several charismatic ideologues like Arafat and al Sadat. If the presence of such men inflamed the people's passions, then would not their sudden, abrupt absence snuff these passions out?\n\nThe United States government has always been a staunch advocate of evidence based policy. As its foremost experts in unconventional policymaking, Langley has been tasked to make conclusive results out of Pan-Arabism's greatest progeny."
USA_In_For_The_Kill_desc:0 "What America needs the least in the middle of its greatest economic crisis since the Depression is a protracted conflict sucking its money and attention. South Africa and Indonesia had played merry hell on both - and that was with a healthy economy. From White House to janitor, America's government has wholeheartedly resolved to prevent Saudi Arabia from spiraling into a worse repeat of the last two wars that had wasted its energies and fortunes.\n\nTo this end, the President has requested that the Pentagon draw a time table for military operations in the Middle East, immediately followed by withdrawal plans upon the war's conclusion. If Washington has its way, then American soldiers will not spend any more time in the sandbox than they absolutely must."

USA.oilcrisis.1.desc:0 "The horrible fighting has begun again.\n\nBeneath the shifting sands of the Middle East oil pumps like blood through the veins of some slumbering primordial deity. Proboscoid derricks pierce the sediment in their hundreds, gluttonously sucking up the earth's bounty to feed the world's limitless thirst for petroleum. It is strange, absurd even, to think that the most valuable commodity in the world, and, indeed, the grease that spins society's cogs is little more than the corpses of prehistoric flora. And yet, every day, America burns through uncountable tons of this ancient biomass, without which our nation would grind to a screeching halt.\n\nPerhaps the only thing in the Middle East older than the land itself is the people. They wandered the sands for a thousand generations before the first city, and will surely do so again after the fall of the last. Entrenched in their ancient ways, they fought and married each other for millennia in the neverending dance of civilization, and every so often, as the years ground by, the cradle of humanity exploded into sudden and ferocious violence.\n\nOnce more, blood is spilled on the sand. Under the Italian boot for decades, the Arabs have risen up to form the nascent United Arab Republic, intent on expelling the foreigners from their homeland and taking claim of their own destiny. As the Italians desperately try to stop the spread of rebellion, the Saudi king watches from Riyadh, perhaps seeing his opportunity to grip the region in an iron fist.\n\nOur diplomatic staff, terrified of the distant explosions and gunfire they can hear from their offices, have been sending in frantic reports on the escalating crisis. Reading between the lines, the central message is clear: our oil supply is threatened. The situation appears bleak. America may soon find itself deprived of oil unless we act, soon and decisively. As the Middle East embroils itself in bloodshed, the policy-makers in Washington debate about what action to take, and our men in the Middle East are airlifted to safety, one thing is certain: it is happening again."

USA.oilcrisis.2.desc:0 "Wall Street is the heart of the American economy, and today it's beating harder than ever. Turmoil erupted on the trading floor after our plan to set prices on oil became public, and what can only be described as mass hysteria ensued as traders followed the trail of current events to the ongoing crisis in the Middle East, realizing the way the wind was blowing. \n\nThankfully it proved to be a minor hiccup, and the chaos on the trading floor quickly died down. Despite the initial hullabaloo, setting prices on oil has allowed us to maintain control of Wall Street and keep the markets relatively stable, averting the economic disaster many of our advisors were certain was imminent. \n\nOf course, we've made a lot of people angry. Commodities traders in particular are unsurprisingly furious, but the anger of a gang of hair-gelled smooth-talking champagne-drinkers is a small price to pay to avoid economic meltdown."

Now our citizens can once again drive to their dead-end jobs and heat up their TV dinners without fear of impediment! \n\nAnd thank goodness for that, because without oil America would come apart like a house of cards in a tropical typhoon. Nevertheless, we can't let ourselves become complacent. The turmoil in the Middle East doesn't look like it's going to stop any time soon, and although the brunt of the crisis has been averted for the time being, if the violence escalates we can expect a similarly chaotic impact on America's markets. Our oil supplies are already stretched pretty far, and the worse it gets the more draconian our response will have to be just to keep the wheels spinning. \n\nFrankly, the reports coming in from our men in the Middle East are getting bleaker by the day. Oil distribution is still far from secure, and it appears as if none of the players have the power to end this conflict quickly. Most worryingly, we've just received a report from the CIA about several UAR nations joining into a single political entity, but who's to say if it's accurate? All kinds of rumours are pouring in, and it's getting more and more difficult to separate the truth from the baseless gossip. \n\nRight now there's no way to tell which way the wind is blowing, and that kind of uncertainty isn't good for anyone. We'll have to wait and see, but at least it seems the worst has been avoided. \n\nFor now."

USA.oilcrisis.4.desc:0 "As the airplane's doors opened, the heat hit Bruce in the face like a nuclear blast. To a Minnesota boy used to freezing winters and mild summers, it was like stepping into a kiln. Christ, he knew it was going to be hot but this was something else. Lucifer himself would sweat in this. \n\nBruce gathered his resolve and started down the airstair to the scorching tarmac of the runway. He could already feel his shirt moistening and, after only a few seconds in Riyadh, he understood instantly why the Arabs wore those billowing robes. \n\nParked ostentatiously in the middle of the airstrip was a Rolls Royce, dark green as far as he could tell through the light reflecting blindingly off the chassis. The chauffeur opened the rear door. Bruce gave him a nod and ducked inside. \n\nGod is merciful: it was air-conditioned. Hell's bells, thought Bruce, an air-conditioned car is a luxury even back in the States and here's one in the middle of the damn desert. Sitting opposite him, and flanked by two extremely large bodyguards, was Crown Prince Khalid, swathed in enough white cloth to sew a sail for a Spanish treasure galleon. He shook Khalid's hand as the Crown Prince scrutinised him through his aviator sunglasses and responded to his pleasantries in impeccable English. "A pleasure, Mr. Laingen," he said, although his face betrayed little. \n\nAs they were driven to the Palace, Bruce and the Crown Prince stiltedly discussed the region's ongoing conflict, Bruce assuring the Prince of America's unwavering commitment to Saudi Arabia in the face of the crisis. Nevertheless, as the two discussed the merits of this or that policy, Bruce couldn't get the Rolls Royce out of his head. This man is driven in a Rolls, he thought, when his grandfather rode a camel. Would his grandson also drive a Rolls, or would the House of Saud once again ride camels over Arabia's shifting sands?"

USA.oilcrisis.5.t:0 "Smoke on the Wind"
USA.oilcrisis.5.desc:0 "Bruce Laingen sat resting his head on his palm, reading and re-reading the communique from Washington. He'd been ensconced in the American embassy for days, drafting policy plans in the searing heat, ceiling fans going full bore. They often revolved so fast he was half-afraid they'd spin off their axes and decapitate him. Frankly, now he'd received his orders, he was almost starting to hope for it. \n\nWith a sigh, he called in Agent Hunt, one of the latest concrete cowboys Langley had sent him. Like most Agency men in the field, Hunt was a red-blooded American with a taste for beer, football and shooting foreigners. Bruce had an almost instantaneous dislike for the man, but if they were going to be forced to work together, they may as well try and be civil. After all, personality conflicts aside, they were striving for the same goal. Bruce lit a cigarette, and offered one to Hunt. He tossed the communique over to Hunt's side of the desk. \n\n"The President's decided to put boots on the ground," he said laconically, in a carefully neutral tone of voice. He had become paranoid lately that his office might be bugged, by either the Saudis or the Agency, and did not want to give them any indication that he was doubting the efficacy of the slowly escalating policy of interventionism in the Middle East. \n\nHunt glanced over the document, then flicked his eyes to Bruce's. "We'd better get ready then, is what you're saying," he said, a barely perceptible grin on his face. \n\nBruce nodded. "Get everyone organized, the first of them are gonna be here pretty damn soon and we're nowhere near ready to receive them. And for god's sake, get Frank to keep the Saudis off my damn back!" \n\nHunt stood, and flashed Bruce a pearly white smile as he made for the door. "Hot damn, it's gonna be just like another South Africa!""

USA.oilcrisis.6.t:0 ""
USA.oilcrisis.6.desc:0 "Bruce examined King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the allegedly great reformer, through narrowed eyes, shimmering hazily in the cigarette smoke that filled the great banquet hall. He found it darkly amusing to see the normally so uptight Saudis sitting around smoking, drinking and groping dancing girls, all the vices they spent so much hypocritical breath decrying. \n\nThe King himself had apparently been handsome in his youth, but Bruce couldn't see any evidence of it now. Surrounded by giggling wives and concubines a third of his age, the King was bloated, droopy and covered in liver spots. He reminded Bruce of a scoop of rum and raisin ice cream that had been left sitting in the sun. \n\nAnd yet, despite all outward appearances, King Faisal was one of the shrewdest political operators he'd ever met. The man was wily as a fox. \n\nBruce noticed suddenly that the King was looking in his direction. He beckoned for Bruce to come to him at the other end of the table, and Bruce went without hesitation. When the King beckons, you come. \n\nThe King liked to project an urbane aura when speaking to Westerners, but Bruce could detect the hint of menace lurking beneath the King's friendly facade. "My dear Mr. Laingen! I did not know you were here. A pleasure to see you once again in the Palace! I trust things are progressing at the Embassy?" \n\nSneaky bastard, thought Bruce. He knows full well I was on the guest list. His reply, however, was far more deferential. "Yes, your majesty. Our defence and intelligence network has been thoroughly established. Our agents are at your disposal to root out the traitors to your rule." \n\nThe King smiled, but his eyes were as cold and immovable as a glacier. "My dear Bruce, I must commend you! You do your nation credit. We are proud to have the United States as our ally." \n\nBruce kept his face carefully neutral. Are you?, he wondered."

USA.oilcrisis.7.desc:0 "We could hardly have expected our deployment of ground combat troops to Saudi Arabia to remain covert for long, and since it's gone public we've become inundated with opposition to our escalation of the American presence in the Middle East. Students and South Africa veterans have staged anti-war demonstrations in several universities and parks across America, and they've made public their plans to march on Washington to call for a halt in deployment. \n\nSenators from both sides of the party divide are being buried in angry letters from constituents, many of them who had family who died in Africa, and consequently are urgently calling in Congress for a freeze in troop deployments or, for the more radical Senators, a total withdrawal. \n\nWe'd lose serious face in the international community if we just pulled out, and we can't abandon the Saudis, slimy bastards though they may be, without jeopardising our oil supply. All we can do is hope tensions don't keep escalating and we get stuck in a war we can't win. Goddamn it all, why does such an oil-rich region have to be so unstable?"

Rag-tag guerrillas are no match for American airpower. \n\nUnfortunately, their friends might be. German diplomats have made their nation's displeasure clear, calling us hypocrites for running operations in the no-fly zone. Germany's opposition, of course, does not come from a love of peace but from a desire to protect their sometime-allies in the pan-Arabist movement, presumably afraid that an unfriendly faction taking control of the region could throttle their oil supply. \n\nUltimately, what do we care what they think? Germany is unlikely to put boots on the ground in the Middle East in order to avoid a confrontation, and, after all, we're in desperate need of the oil too. Better we pump it into America rather than allow it to grease the gears of the cruellest superpower in history."

USA.oilcrisis.9.t:0 "Taming the Beast"
USA.oilcrisis.9.desc:0 "You'd have to be a damn fool to trust the Saudis, but they're the only native group in the region even slightly friendly to the US. Nobody could say that they were reliable, but having the Saudis on our side gives us a valuable beachhead into the Middle East to protect exports of precious, precious oil. \n\nNevertheless, the values of Saudi Arabia are distasteful even to the most hardline reactionaries back home, and it's getting increasingly difficult to justify our alignment with a nation so diametrically opposed to the virtues of freedom and liberty that Americans hold dear. It's hard to see the Saudis as the lesser of two evils when they deny women even the most basic rights and behead political and religious prisoners like some kind of medieval warlord. Some commentators back home are even comparing the pan-Arabists to the American revolutionaries of the 18th century, which, presumably, would cast us in the role of King George. \n\nIf we're going to back the Saudis, it's our responsibility to try and nudge them away from hardline conservative Salafism. The idea of a republican or, Allah forgive me for uttering this word, secular Arabia is a pipe dream, but if we carefully influence Saudi thought leaders we can perhaps engender positive social change in Arabia and avoid the mistakes of the old apartheid regime in Guyana. \n\nThe CIA's current plan is a covert operation to influence the hearts and minds of Saudi Arabians who might be sympathetic to our ideals, mainly non-Salafist intellectuals and the petit bourgeois. The Saudi upper crust would balk at sudden change, but perhaps over the next few decades of our association with them we can nudge the oil kingdom in a brighter direction."

USA.oilcrisis.10.desc:0 "They are streaming across the border in their tens of thousands, many of them with little more than the babies in their arms and the clothes on their backs. Every war creates refugees, but the sudden brutality of the conflict in the Middle East is annihilating ancient ways of life and sending people fleeing from the land their ancestors have occupied for centuries in a way never seen before, and they're all flocking to what appears to be the last remaining beacon of stability in the region: the Saudi Kingdom. \n\nMost of them aren't exactly friendly to Saudi or Western interests, but more than that, they fear and hate the men who expelled them from their homes. As the pan-Arabists spread their tentacles over more and more of the Middle East, that hate could be a powerful weapon against an increasingly dangerous enemy. \n\nOur man in Riyadh, veteran diplomat Bruce Laingen, has presented us with a plan drawn up by two CIA operatives under his command, Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt. It suggests training and arming the refugees and sending them back into the fray as a totally deniable army to fight the pan-Arabists without smearing red, white and blue across the Middle East. If it seems like we're uninvolved, the local response will likely be far more amenable to a native army whose interests just happen to coincide with our own. This could be a way for us to exert our influence in the region without having to send our boys to die in the desert."

The towering date palms let very little light into the courtyard, and in the twilight it was filled with a dim purple glow. By a shimmering pool sat King Faisal, sipping coffee from a silver goblet. \n\nThe King motioned for Bruce to sit. At some unspoken signal the garden was suddenly empty. The King set his coffee down and gazed into the pool. At last he began to speak, not looking up. \n\n"America is a young country, is it not? Forged in the fires of revolution some two centuries past. Indeed, the very ideals that drive your nation are scarcely older than America itself." \n\nHe glanced up to meet Bruce's eyes, and Bruce shuddered in the coldness of his gaze. "We are an old culture. The legacy of the Arab people goes back far further than your own, our way of life is founded on values and ideals millennia older than yours. Our faith in God is the driving force behind our society, tradition its cornerstone. You must come to understand this or someday the desert will consume you as it has so many others." \n\nThe garden darkened as the sun slipped below the horizon. "I love to sit here after the rain," confided the King, leaning back in his chair and folding his hands over his belly. "The coolness after a storm is a rare pleasure in Riyadh. Imagine the hubris to construct a garden such as this! This palace and its garden will be here long after America has crumbled into the sands of time, and the ways of our people will exist as unchanged in the years to come as they have for so many centuries." He glanced over at Bruce. "I hope you understand." \n\nBruce heard the message loud and clear: the King wanted an end to the CIA's program of liberalization. Heart in his throat, he felt a sudden burst of fury at the veiled threats of this decrepit old wreck. "Your people once built great gardens in Cordoba, your majesty, before the forces of Christendom burned them to the ground. You should consider the fate of the Moors before you make threats." \n\nWith that he rose, and left the King to sit alone in the twilit darkness of his garden."

Apparently, the CIA has been meeting with university professors, business owners and the like to discuss liberal policy change in the Kingdom. They've even held several secret meetings with the ones most sympathetic to their degenerate views. \n\nFaith and tradition are the cornerstones of our society, without them we are nothing. We're perfectly happy to accept American money and American guns, but they can keep their corrupt values. It's time we identify those they've influenced and make sure they're silenced. The Americans can hardly just pull their aid, not when they're as oil-starved as they are, and that might be all we need to put an end to the toxic ideas spewing forth from the American embassy. \n\nOur ways have survived the long ages and a parade of conquerors, whose bones lie forgotten under the sands while we carry on.

Our new planes are set to soon arrive at Port Dammam, and our boys in Riyadh have already drawn up plans for ambitious missions against the pan-Arabist menace. \n\nWe don't plan to let the Middle East and its oil escape our grasp just 'cause the limp-wrists back home balk at the idea of dropping a few million tons of bombs on people who are fighting, as we once did, for their freedom, liberty and right to self-determination.

The icy cold drink and the frantically rotating ceiling fans did little to cool him down. \n\nAfter Hunt left in a huff, swearing that something had to be done about "those damn slimy Arabs", Bruce sat back, wondering what was to be done. He got up and walked to the window, flicking open the Venetian blinds. Past the low, white buildings of Riyadh he could see the endless desert expanse, stretching all the way out into the scorching nothingness of the Empty Quarter. The view reminded him often of what Minnesota might look like if it was covered in sand. Like Arabia, the only round things in Minnesota were the fruit on the trees and some of the people. \n\nAnd yet, despite the similarity of the land they inhabited, the people of Minnesota and Arabia couldn't have been more different. He often found himself unable to understand why the locals did anything they did, why they held onto these bizarre, archaic beliefs. It was like living in a kingdom from the Dark Ages that had been dumped into the twentieth century. \n\nBruce closed the blinds and went to sit back behind his desk, slumping into the chair, still moist with his sweat. The authoritarian Saudi police would have to be dealt with if Americans were to operate unrestricted through the country. The Saudis would hate it, of course, and he had little doubt that the King and the Crown Prince would try every possible tactic to keep the status quo, but if they didn't stop harassing American operatives they'd feel the wrath of Uncle Sam. \n\nHe took a page and began to draft up some ideas to handle the situation, narrowing it down to two main contenders: play nice with the Saudis, maybe throw them a bone or two, or serve them a veiled threat by reminding them that America could pull out and cut off their lifeline if they didn't get back over the line."

USA.oilcrisis.16.desc:0 "Gambling may be illegal in the oil kingdom, but that doesn't mean the Saudis can't put on a damn good poker face. Bruce had spent the morning in a series of meetings with a rotating gang of Saudi officials, ministers of one sort or another, all of whom looked exactly the same: portly, bearded men wearing aviator sunglasses and enough white cloth to make a hot air balloon. Bruce was forced to repeat himself with each one of them: reform their authoritarian and overzealous police force, or suffer a reduction in American funding. \n\nTheir reaction was invariably the same. It consisted of a brief explanation of the importance in the kingdom of Sharia law, tradition, faith, yadda yadda. All stuff he'd heard before, and like before he found it impossible to believe after seeing what the Saudi upper crust were like behind closed doors. When he had requested to meet with the King, or the Crown Prince, he was told blankly that they were not receiving visitors. Frankly, he wasn't surprised he was on the King's shit-list after their little confrontation in the garden, but now he couldn't even talk to him? \n\nSo the Saudis wanted to play hardball did they? Well, two could play at that game. Back in his stifling office, Bruce wondered how to deal with them. God knew he wanted to turn the screws on the bastards, but the angel on his shoulder was being very insistent in telling him to take the high road and back off. Even so, he couldn't shake off his anger at their condescension, brushing him off like he wasn't threatening to throttle their aid. He narrowed his eyes. Surely they had to be bluffing...?"

USA.oilcrisis.17.desc:0 ""Goddamn Saudis!" yelled Bruce Laingen, impotently flinging his mug against the wall. It shattered in a cascade of ceramic debris. He swung to his terrified secretary, a cringing suburbanite from Long Island. "Get the hell out!" he spat. She vanished from the room faster than Bruce's hopes for a quiet day without trouble from the Saudis. \n\nBruce slumped into his chair, the leather instantly sticking his shirt to his back. It was the Chinese, he recalled, who cursed people by wishing them to live in interesting times. The Saudis were making his life extremely interesting indeed. His attempt to intimidate the Saudis by threatening to pull out had been a complete and utter failure. He could almost feel Faisal and Khalid and the rest of the aviator-wearing bastards laughing at him in the Palace. \n\nBruce laid his head in his hands. The Saudis knew America needed them, and they knew America was desperate for oil. He was supposed to be working them, and yet somehow they'd maneuvered him into a corner. Faisal was calling the shots now, and he had sent a letter filled with extremely thinly veiled threats, in essence a demand for the CIA's social liberalization program to be discontinued and for American interference in Saudi internal politics to be immediately halted. There was the suggestion that further interference could result in a butterfly effect leading to a halt in oil shipments to the United States. It didn't take a genius to read between the lines there. \n\nWell, Bruce thought, they've sure got us over a barrel here. He sighed. After all, what did he care about democracy in the Middle East? As long as the oil kingdom kept up the shipments, Washington would be happy."

On the other side of the ludicrously oversized mahogany table sat King Faisal, the Crown Prince, and a number of ministers. The usual suspects, in other words. \n\nBruce plastered a smile on his face, hoping he didn't look too ingenuous. After their tiff in the garden, he was surprised but glad the King had agreed to meet with him. He may have grown to hate the slippery, corpulent warlord, but god knows America needed a stable oil-exporting ally in the region, and the Saudis were just about the only option. \n\nAfter the stilted pleasantries, the real discussion began, both sides trying to get as much as possible from their opponent while giving up as little as possible, the endless dance of diplomacy, negotiating and bargaining. Bruce was in his element. Determined to control himself, he gave the Saudis several minor concessions they wanted. It seemed to make them happy, but with the Saudis it was difficult to tell. \n\nFinally, after over an hour of dancing around it, the central point came up at last. Bruce's attempts to play nice with the Saudis had at least gotten his foot in the door, and now it was time to wedge the door open or forever give it up. As much as they pretended at supreme military dominance, Bruce knew the Saudi military was far from the juggernaut the King wished he had at his disposal. He could, of course, just play it cool, restore friendly relations and avoid further embarrassment... or, he considered, he could offer them the weapons agreement he knew they wanted. If a bunch of new toys couldn't mollify Faisal and get him to cooperate, Bruce reflected grimly, it was probable nothing would."

USA.oilcrisis.19.desc:0 "Bruce stood sipping coffee at the window in his office as he watched the dust cloud build over the horizon. After a few minutes, the first in the line of brand-new American troop transports emblazoned with Saudi emblems came powering over the rise into the suburbs of Riyadh. Next would be the tanks, and the helicopters, and the cargo loads of guns, explosives, yadda yadda. \n\nHe drew the blinds and sat down. The King was signing the laws to put a leash on his overzealous police force and to allow a few token liberalizations in a closed ceremony in the Palace. It hadn't even made the news, which Bruce was sure wasn't an accident. Along with the seemingly endless materiel, the Saudis were getting millions more in aid and development funds siphoned by the Agency's oh-so-clever accountants in Washington. \n\nAs he listened to the trucks rumble past, Bruce blackly sipped his coffee. When he thought about it, the Saudis had gotten a hell of a lot more out of his agreement than he'd managed to get for America. He felt like a customer in a bazaar who thought he'd gotten a great bargain out of a haggle but had actually gotten swindled. He'd been warned Faisal was an infamous political operator, and yet somehow along the way Bruce had let him get the better of him. He supposed he'd had a chance to get the upper hand at some point, but he must have missed it. He almost had to admire them for it. Almost. \n\nFaisal and Khalid and the rest of them must be having a good laugh up at the Palace at having got one over on that degenerate heathen American. And yet, what could he possibly have done? America needed the Saudis on their side, for better or for worse. Anything as long as it kept the oil flowing. \n\nFinishing his coffee, Bruce sighed, and hoped it wouldn't be long until he could go home to the snowy plains of Minnesota, and never have to step foot in the desert again."

USA.oilcrisis.20.t:0 "Diplomatic Impudence"
USA.oilcrisis.20.desc:0 "Bruce sat, stunned, as the door swung shut. He looked up and down the now-empty room. After a minute, he realized they weren't coming back. \n\nAs he was driven back to the embassy, Bruce sat in the back seat in the depths of a fell mood, his every muscle tensed. When he had offered a new weapons agreement to the King in exchange for token liberalizations and further cooperation from his government, the King had sneered, calling the United States weak and decadent. His ministers and the Crown Prince rising with him, King Faisal had declared that he would never compromise the deeply held beliefs and values of the Arabian people to appease America, especially not for what he deemed a "bribe". The King left sneering, cursing Americans as servants of Mammon. \n\nBruce was fuming. He couldn't shake the feeling that this was somehow personal, the King's retaliation for the harsh words they had exchanged in the garden. Could the man really be so vain that he would sacrifice such a one-sided deal for something so petty? Perhaps he had underestimated Faisal and his coterie. \n\nOf course, this didn't mark the end of America's association with the Saudis. They had become entangled into a frankly dangerous symbiotic relationship, the Saudis relying on America's military power and influence, and the Americans on Saudi oil. And here he was, Bruce Laingen of Butterfield, Minnesota, somehow caught up in the middle of it. \n\nGoddamn it all, he thought. All he could do now was try to satisfy Washington without rocking the boat too much. It was clear now that there would never be democracy in the Middle East if they were unwilling to give up their medieval practices. As long as the oil kept flowing Stateside, it would be enough. \n\nBruce leaned back into the richly upholstered leather, and dreamed of returning to the snowy fields of Minnesota."

Its bitumen pave the country's many thousand miles of highway; its petrols, kerosenes and diesels fuel the trucks, planes, ships and cars transferring money and goods from city to city; its naptha and gas compose many chemicals and heat many homes. Whether from rigs off the Louisiana coast or the bountiful wells in the Arabian Peninsula, cheap oil is the linchpin keeping the world's strongest economy strong from the bottom up.\n\nThen one sunny day in the turn of the decade, oil prices quadruple to $12 a barrel. And like an engine with neither lubricant nor fuel, the world's strongest economy sputters into a sudden stop. Pandemonium strikes Wall Street's floors as indexes dovetail past their troughs with no signs of slowing down, let alone stopping. Main Street fares little better: look only at the miles-long lines of cars outside gas stations across the country, both awaiting shipments of fuel that will never come. As conflagrations spark abroad, the crisis they have brought to America's shores have skyrocketed the prices of goods while simultaneously keeping people from earning money for them - in other words, a cataclysm poised to stunt, even reverse, a decade of growth.\n\nAmerica turns desperately to Capitol Hill for an answer to the world's first ever oil shock.

Like so many others, It was a squalid collection of huts whose inhabitants made their meagre living by grazing cattle. It would forever have avoided the pages of history, if it wasn't for one ill-fated patrol.\n\nAnd so, in the baking heat of the afternoon, they came. A group of American soldiers strode into Hamlet 773, guns out. It had been months since any Americans had come their way, and they all came out to see them. Their leader was a boy with pimples on his face. He indicated the oldest man present, the village elder, and began to shout at him, his voice cracking, his pale face growing red.\n\nThe elder, unable to speak English, tried to figure out what he wanted, but the boy soon lost patience. He shouted at his troops, and they moved into the huts, ransacking them. As the elder approached the American to ask him to stop, the boy struck him to the ground. Lights swam behind the elder's eyes as he wiped the blood from his face. He could hear shouting, in Tswana and English. Looking through clouded eyes, he saw a group of women approach the boy, pointing at him and yelling. The elder tried to entreat them to calm, but the words died in his throat.\n\nEverything after that happened so suddenly. A girl ran from the group. She didn't get five paces before a shot rang through the air and she dropped like a ragdoll. The elder tried to rise, fell. Shots tore through the air above him. Silence. Then the wailing began.\n\nIt hadn't taken more than ten seconds. Gathering what little remained of his strength, the elder rose to his knees. Twisted bodies lay everywhere. Women, children. The American boy was shouting, his voice cracking. The elder looked back to his people, the few still upright keening, wide-eyed with horror. He began to crawl, but felt his spirit fading, like a cloud passing into the distance. Fainter, fainter..."

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal craft came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and flames rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from them. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any conqueror of antiquity. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. The helicopters left back through the smoke, leaving the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten."

Backed by the bleak vastness of the sky, the weary Americans passed through the kraal.\n\nIt was barely a village, a collection of shacks made of rubbish and dry wood, a handful of emaciated goats and sheep who gazed forlornly on the men as they made their way into the centre of the feeble settlement. Their leader, a boy with patchy fuzz on his upper lip, looked around him into the houses, and saw in the gaps between planks the sullen red faces sneering at him with the hateful eyes of the conquered.\n\nEvacuate, he called, once, twice. They only glared and snarled in their pig-speech, and the boy felt his anger stoked at their contempt. Forward, he motioned, and the masked men approached with their strange machines, and the villagers watched them in confusion.\n\nWithout further warning, fire poured forth and the shacks went up in flames. Screaming, they began to flee, clutching babies and valuables, crashing to the ground as shots ripped through the air, tearing into their sunburned skin in fountains of blood.\n\nWithin minutes, the all-consuming fire had cleansed the village from the face of the earth. All that remained was the ash, and the bodies, and the boy-commander gazing upon the destruction he had wrought with faraway eyes. Sifting through the remains, the Americans found no evidence of the hidden Boer cache they had come so far to find.

One of the men punched him full force in the stomach and the chest, over and over again as the other watched, asking questions he didn't know the answers to. After a time, the torturer went to wash his hands clean while the Boer spat blood onto the concrete floor. It glistened in the harsh yellow glare of the sodium lights.\n\nNext came the pliers. He was determined not to scream, but his resolve broke immediately as the frowning torturer ripped out his thumbnail. The questioner continued in his monotonous drone, speaking the Afrikaans of one who had not been born to it. Where were they, how many were there, where were the supplies coming from. All the Boer could say was that he did not know, but they were not satisfied. After his remaining fingernails were lying on the floor in pools of blood, the torturer went to work on his teeth.\n\nAfter a time, the Boer awoke. He wondered how much time had passed in the dank, stinking cellar. The torturer wheeled a car battery forward and attached jumper cables to it, then clipped the clamps to his nipples. The Boer felt electricity light his brain up like a Christmas tree. For a moment the shock was so strong he didn't even feel the pain, but it came. Oh, it came. When he proved once again unable to answer their questions, the torturer swapped the clamps to his testicles.\n\nEventually, morning came. In an alley in Cape Town, down by the docks, a nondescript door opened. A young man with slicked-back red hair walked outside into the dim sunlight, rolling his shoulders and stretching his neck. Behind him, he awkwardly dragged a garbage bag, the contents sloshing around with every step. He heaved it into an already overflowing dumpster, and, shielding his eyes from morning's bright light, made his way back inside.\n\nSoon, they would be bringing in the next prisoner."

Tanks, helicopters and all kinds of weapons and explosives were littered across the continent in abandoned camps. Among this bounty, claimed by the Americans, was the Germans' invisible killer: poison gas.\n\nAs the men of Tiger Force advanced across the savannah, they ransacked many such camps, eventually coming into possession of a sizable stock of gas grenades, which they carried around with them, itching to find some krauts to use them on. \n\nIt was a regular patrol, to yet another of the half-empty hamlets that dotted the savannah. Their radio was on the fritz again, so as they milled around waiting for new orders, they decided to play a game: see how far away they could chuck a gas grenade into the village's well.\n\nA ruddy-faced corporal eventually managed it at ten paces. As the grenade clattered down into the well, they heard the pin get ripped out and the hiss of the gas filling the well as the grenade sunk into the water.\n\nAn old African approached them, yelling, repeating "Poison, poison!" over and over again. With a sneer the corporal shoved him to the dirt, his buddies laughing. Their laughter was cut short as more villagers came out of their huts, first curious to see what all the fuss was about, then furious. The elder stood, his nose bloodied, and began to shout at them. The other villagers were shouting too, closing in.\n\nWhen they stood before the panel at their disciplinary hearing, every man of Tiger Force said they didn't know who had fired the first shot, or who had thrown the poison grenade into the village's only source of water. Nevertheless, when the smoke had cleared, the ground was littered with shattered corpses. The few survivors were evacuated from their ancestral lands and, as the days went by, the plants and animals withered and died as the poison spread through the soil. It would be decades before life returned to the land.\n\nIf it ever did."

Ensconced in his insectoid helmet, opaque black plates covering his eyes and a proboscoid hose pumping oxygen into his lungs, the pilot could hear only the humming of the engine, the gentle susurration of voices on the radio.\n\nA crackling voice fed coordinates into his ear. Acknowledging, he set the wheels of destruction in motion. If he had given it any thought he would have assumed they were carrying weapons or enemy troops, but he didn't think, or, more likely, simply didn't care. It is easy to deal death from a distance, never having to look into the enemy's eyes, hear them cry and scream and beg for mercy.\n\nThe bombs screamed downward, whistling through the air, but the pilot didn't hear them. Before their impact, there was a moment of peace that seemed to stretch for an eternity, where everything was locked where it was. Then the explosions blasted across the savannah, blowing apart the trucks in an eruption of twisted metal.\n\nSatisfied with a job well done, the pilot turned back to base. He would never see the villagers running to the shattered remains of the convoy, horrified to see their shipment of vital supplies obliterated, not a scrap remaining, and the road torn apart, their only lifeline to the outside world.\n\nHe would never see the children starving, the people dying of curable disease, the death and agony of their eventual migration away from their ancestral lands, desperate to survive. That flash of metal in the sky, sighted above the village for a split second, had forever decided their destinies, destroying lives, wiping a whole community from the map, but the man who had pushed the button would know none of this. After dozens of subsequent missions, he would scarcely even remember it."

Some held photos of husbands, children, brothers whose bodies - lost in the jungle or mangled beyond recognition - they couldn't even hold for a last goodbye, others posters decrying the "useless sacrifice" of human lives and accusing the "bloodthirsty capitalists" who "feed on death" to be the true force behind the government's decision to increase the draft.\n\nThe guards outside were visibly in difficulty: they surrounded the small crowd, but didn't try to dislodge them as they were unarmed and quiet. They didn't scream or try to force the block: they all waited there, and looked at a certain window, where a certain person was looking back. The President couldn't see their eyes, they were too distant for that, but he felt it: that cold, unwavering stare, full of hate and desire for vengeance made chills run down his spine."

With more and more agents dispatched to monitor the growing opposition movements for signs of extremism, director Hoover is extremely worried about the future of the Union should this state of affairs not change.\n\nOne thing is certain: the President might refuse to open his windows to avoid looking outside, but the hate for the war is growing. From colleges, where the deans report acts of vandalism, disobedience and secret meetings between students, to cities, with the police stretched thin to keep order, America is starting to fall apart at the seams.

Extremism is spreading throughout the country like wildfire, demagogues and radicals spreading their lies and ideologies to everyone desperate or angry enough to listen to them. Far left and far right are united in their violent accusations: the President is a traitor to the United States for having sent tens of thousands of brave Americans to their deaths just to make the industrialists happy, they say.

Day after day, the protests get worse. Chaos grips the capital, and the situation can only get worse. For once however, today the chaos outside the House is only matched by what's going on inside.\n\nThe General Staff is all there, in the Oval Office, uniforms perfectly ironed and medals hiding the cloth, but they all looked like scared children. One of them opens his mouth: "President-" "SILENCE!" the voice booms, surpassing for once the mayhem outside, then the noise returns, as all others within the room stand silently.

Some banks had their glasses broken, general stores were heavily guarded by private security, and all the common people had the same look in their face: fear. Fear for tomorrow, fear for the lost stability, but more than anything, fear that this damn war will claim their loved ones too.\n\nWhen he descended from his car near the Senate, immediately the guards were around him, but this also made the crowd aware of his presence. Immediately, a collective roar emerged, and thousands tried to get to him: The President instinctively retreaded, scared of the hate directed towards him, while the security tried to safely get him inside the building.

The central compound of the colonial government was the last sector of the city to fall, as almost two hundred soldiers, supported by a battalion of the native SS, had bunkered in the heavily-fortified building, forcing the American troops to clear the underground corridors and booby-trapped halls with flamethrowers and military engineers.\n\nThe last weeks had seen the combined Allied troops inflicting defeat after defeat against the Reichskommissariat, steadily gaining ground against a weakened and demoralized opponent, but this might be the turning point for the war: with the fall of Windhoek, the Schild has lost its largest air fields, and large supplies fuel and airplane parts have been seized by the attackers before the Germans could retreat.\n\nReikscommissar Schenck has managed to flee the city on his personal fighter, and in his first statement he has sworn "to bring back the German flag to Windhoek ", but with the western front in disarray and Schild troops still retreating, many doubt whether he'll be able to keep faith to his word."

Troops from the entire coalition attacked with fierceness bordering desperation, and despite heavy losses managed to push the frontline until the South Africans and their American allies had to fall back to the outskirts of the city.\n\nIt was immediately evident how ill-prepared had been the defenders, as they never thought the Germans would actually be able to react to the last defeat. Bombing runs from Südwestafrikaner pilots, eager to get revenge for the humiliation, quickly neutralized the scattered anti-aircraft batteries and proceeded to hammer the garrison with all kinds of payloads. Rather than suffering heavy losses, the commander preferred to retreat from the city, and convoys filled with soldiers and supplies quickly left the cities the night before the attack.\n\nThe following day, the German troops entered the liberated Windhoek in triumph, though the locals seemed less than happy to welcome their saviors. Reichskommissar Schenck returned to the city hailed by his soldiers, and resumed his post in the administrative compound, now under heavy repairs.

After a brief last stand in the town hall, the officer in command of the city agreed to the surrender terms offered by the Federation: the civilian irregulars were disarmed and allowed to return to their families, while all others were taken prisoners.\n\nEven though the government evacuated the city long before the offensive began, due to safety reasons, the fall of Bloemfontein is still a hard blow to take for the Boer cause.

While most of the soldiers managed to retreat in order, there weren't enough transports to take in the ANC partisans, who accused the Americans of having betrayed them. As they had nowhere to run, they decided to fight to the last man rather than surrendering: they fell one by one waging a fierce guerrilla against the advancing Boers, sabotaging several industrial facilities and dealing much heavier losses than they took, until they were completely vanquished.\n\nWith the liberation of Johanasburg, the Republic has regained control of its industrial core, and reparations are already underway to bring the military production plants to full efficiency.

As the port itself was lightly defended, and most of the garrison had been sent to the front, there was little the remaining guards could do as hundreds of marines attacked in unison, and heavy naval batteries pounded what little defenses surrounded the docks.\n\nAlready, military engineers have started turning the city into a fortress with whatever they can find at hand, and the port facilities are being repaired for unknown purposes. As Zentralafrika hurries to defend its vulnerable belly, the American-led coalition has already achieved an important victory: by opening a second front directly in the heart of Deutsch-Afrika, they have managed to force their opponent to divert a significant contingent from the main front to the South, severely weakening their frontline. Should the Schild fail to retake Libreville, not only would the flow of supplies from the motherland abruptly end, but it would be the start of a devastating pincer move which could theoretically cause a general collapse of the German colonial alliance."

USA.saf.war.missions.8.desc:0 "To many, the capture of Libreville, and the opening of a second front deep inside Africa, had appeared as the last nail in the Schild's coffin, but the tides have turned once again in this strange, bloody war. It seems the concrete risk of total defeat awakened the German Reichskommissariaten from their torpor: frantic call for arms were emitted, emergency reserves called into service, and the efficient German production plants, fuelled by the death throes of so many unfortunate souls, churned out an endless supply of weapons at the price of thousands more lives in a clean, mathematical proportion. Before the Americans could reinforce the disembarked naval garrison with proper ground troops, the full might of the German war machine was unleashed upon Libreville.\n\nSuddenly, he night was set ablaze by the simultaneous fire from dozens of explosions, and the few who were still asleep were forcibly torn from their dreams by the sounds of explosions and airplanes filling the sky. The marines held their ground and fought fiercely, supported by the constant barrage from the ships anchored at the docks, but they found themselves under attack by an enemy they couldn't hope to defeat: pioneers cleared the minefields and tank traps, while panzers rammed hastily-erected barricades and infantry quickly moved in to seize key points of the defensive line.\n\nThe defenders retreated in order to the port and quickly boarded their ships as they took the sea, thanks to the fact that the Germans carefully avoided bombing the port facilities; still not everyone could find place inside, and many fell in German hands. As the Afrika-Schild draws a collective breath of relief from the averted catastrophe, and the American government faces heavy criticism at home for the hundreds of soldiers dead or captured in what newspapers have called "the Bay of Fools", all contenders return their undivided attention to the main front. It seems the war will last longer than expected."

USA.saf.war.missions.9.desc:0 "The blow was heavy, and the dagger was plunged deep. After a startling string of defeats suffered by the Afrika-Schild, Leopoldville, the administrative center of Reichskommissariat, has fallen into the hands of the American-led coalition. This news comes as a welcomed development for the South Africans and their allies, as it now means that a second front has been successfully established deep inside Deutsch-Afrika, crippling the German war effort and dramatically sinking their morale.\n\nThe city, now bordering the Congo Lake, was poorly fortified, but had strong natural defenses in the form of quagmires and the ever-present jungle, which slowed down the attackers, and severely limited the use of artillery and air support. In the end, however, they weren't necessary: the hastily-erected defences fell after only a short battle as the mercenary garrison preferred to surrender in the face of the dramatic numerical superiority of the enemy. Now, they await to know their fate as it is unclear whether they are actual soldiers or "armed civilians".\n\nWith the fall of Leopoldville, Zentralafrika is on the brink of collapse, and the entire Schild hangs precariously in the balance: unless bold actions are taken, and victory follows, the war will be lost. Which is exactly what their opponents hope. Perhaps, the war is truly coming to an end this time"

USA.saf.war.missions.10.desc:0 "After the fall of Leopoldville, most thought the war would end in a matter of weeks, if not days, with the total collapse of the Afrika-Schild, but it seems they will remain disappointed. In a last, desperate move to cauterize the wound on the western front, the Oberkommando der Afrikanischen Streitkräfte mobilized all remaining forces for a desperate push: Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller himself returned from the southern front to lead the assault on his administrative center. Perhaps this was what spurred the German soldiers to fight even more fiercely than usual, or perhaps it was desperation, but in the end the result didn't change.\n\nThe American garrison fought in the jungles surrounding the city in a desperate attempt to hold back the enemy advance, but they were forced to retreat when the vegetation was set aflame by napalm bombings, and Zentralafrikaner helicopters hunted the scattered bands till the outskirts, where they were forced to retreat by the anti-aircraft batteries hurriedly mounted on the former central compound of the colonial administration. The symbolic value of the building didn't stop the Schild from heavily bombing it, further weakening the defenses before the final push. In the end, most of the garrison managed to leave the city before it fell by seizing several civilian boats and retreating through the lake towards their still-fighting comrades. Müller was reportedly "heartbroken" when he saw his most prized trophies used as "bedside tables and practice targets", and has sworn bitter revenge against those who perpetrated such a sacrilege.\n\nPerhaps this newfound rage will lead Zentralafrika towards a renewed impetus, but the situation remains extremely difficult for the German coalition: with large swathes of the Reichskommissariat still occupied, many doubt that the victory will do anything more than delaying the inevitable, especially with the western front still open like a festering wound. It will take much more than a postcard victory to revert the tides of battle."

USA.saf.war.missions.11.desc:0 "After a string of defeats suffered by the numerically inferior Ostafrikan colonial forces, today the easternmost African Reichskommissariat, and de facto leader of the Afrika-Schild, was forced to take an even worse humiliation, as American forces entered Quelimane, the colony's administrative center and seat of power of Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig.\n\nThe city had been turned into a veritable stronghold, with a ring of bunkers, trenches, minefields and underground tunnels covering the entire perimeter in a hellish maze of interlocking firing zones. What the garrison couldn't expect, however, was an enemy from the inside: though it's unknown whether they took contact with the besieging army, or if they acted on their own, partisan movements all throughout the city's many concentration camps and slave quarters launched a full-scale uprising, slaughtering their jailers and breaking free, spreading chaos and panic in the German quarters of the city. This distraction gave the attackers the perfect opportunity to strike and, despite taking heavy losses, they managed to dislodge the garrison from the outer bastions and enter the urban areas. The last sector to fall was the fortress-complex of the central administration compound, which had been riddled with boody-traps and death zones: over six hundreds soldiers died to take the building from the few dozens of fanatical German SS barricaded there, before military engineers and flamethrower teams were sent in.\n\nQuelimane was a vital hub for the colony, and hosted several industries fundamental to the war effort: the victorious occupants were reportedly "shocked" by what they saw in the countless mining concentration camps and slave factories, where tens of thousands of desperate men, women and children lived in abject poverty and starvation: many were moved to tears as some of the weakest ones died before their very eyes, crying of happiness for being free at last. Reichskommissar Hüttig managed to flee the city, and has sworn to avenge the defeat "with the lives of all Amerikaner in the city", but some doubt the factibility of such a claim."

USA.saf.war.missions.12.t:0 "The Rape of Quelimane"
USA.saf.war.missions.12.desc:0 "Everyone expected Hans Hüttig to try his best to keep faith to his promise of revenge. After all, he was known for his vengeful temper long before taking his office in the Dark Continent. What few predicted, however, was the extent of such single-minded will: the Reichskommissar immediately launched a furious counteroffensive, until the front fell back to the occupied Quelimane. What followed was one of the greatest tragedies to befall this bloodied land.\n\nAerial reconnaissance had showed only minimal troop movements near the city, and the garrison believed they could hold out in the hastily-repaired German defences: this belief soon turned hollow, as the attackers made use of an unmarked web of tunnels, known only to the highest officers, to secretly enter the city at night. Silently, like snakes stalking their prey with the cover of night, SS snipers surgically removed all sentinels and took position around the barracks, waiting for the signal: as soon as it arrived - a single artillery shot - the poisonous jaws closed, and slaughter began.\n\nThe defenders couldn't even take up arms as they were riddled with bullets in their beds, while the units secretly assembled in the forests surrounding the city moved in. No surrender terms were offered to the American commander: he and the few survivors were dragged from the central compound they had bunkered in, tortured for information, and summarily executed, the photos of their mangled corpses sent to the American command to show that Reichskommissar Hüttig always, ALWAYS keeps his promises. The worst, however, came after the victory, as all non-Germans within the city were declared "traitors to the Aryan race": the soldiers simply entered camps, tents, houses and began killing. With bullets. With bayonets. With flamethrowers The few who managed to escape told of SS covered from head to toe in human gore, rummaging through the bullet-ridden bodies of men, women and children to find the few still breathing and finish them with knives. This will surely have an impact upon the OFN coalition"

USA.saf.war.missions.13.t:0 "The Battle of Salisbury"
USA.saf.war.missions.13.desc:0 "Today, the war enters a new phase, as the front has definitely shifted in favor of the OFN coalition. Salisbury, the largest settlement of the former British colony of Rhodesia, now part of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, has fallen into the hands of the American-led coalition. The city was an important industrial center in the area, and home to the command staff for that sector, therefore its capture is an important success against the Afrika-Schild.\n\nThe city had been well-prepared for the siege, with strong defenses and large ammunition supplies, but in the end, the enemy was too strong. One by one, the bunkers were busted by surgical artillery and aerial strikes and tanks moved in to seize the entrenched defenders still fighting. Slowly, the garrison fell inwards to pre-prepared positions, but they found many of them sabotaged or occupied by partisan who had been waiting for the right moment to strike: many German soldiers were felled by surprise bursts of their own HMG, and the rest were crushed between the anvil and the hammer as the South African infantry launched the final offensive.\n\nReichskommissar Hans Hüttig is reportedly "disappointed" by the failure to defend the city, and has issued a conscription order to mobilize additional forces and retake the city as soon as possible. He also threatened the occupying forces to abandon the city immediately, "or suffer the consequences of their hybris". Despite his boisterous claim, all observers agree that this is an important victory for the OFN."

USA.saf.war.missions.14.t:0 "The Second Battle of Salisbury"
USA.saf.war.missions.14.desc:0 "One of the reasons many fear Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig is that he remembers everything. Every slight, every insult, every defeat, every humiliation: he stores them inside, and waits for the moment he can enact his revenge. When Salisbury first fell in the hands of the joint American-South African force, he swore that they would pay for their insolence: now, it seems he has come to collect his debt as the last offensive managed to push deep enough to retake the city.\n\nSalisbury had been prepared for the assault, with new fortifications built in place of the demolished German ones, but it proved no match for the intense incendiary and bunker-busting bombings which targeted the defenses for days. When the Schild launched a full-scale offensive, few were still capable of fighting, and even retreating to more defensible positions in the center proved useless, but when the garrison commander finally surrendered, he was shocked to hear the terms. With the only other alternative being mass execution, they were requested to enact decimation: one every ten soldiers would be selected by chance under German surveillance, and killed by his own comrades. The entire process, intended to break enemy morale, was described in detail by a few prisoners liberated on purpose and allowed to return to their units.\n\nThe American high command was shocked by the news, but even more shocking was the tale of what the native population was subjected to: hundreds of suspected partisans, along with even more slaves who had "dared" to leave their camps and go live in houses left empty by evacuated German families, were summarily executed by firing squads, their corpses thrown into mass graves. It seems that the war will last more than expected, and it will reach an even higher degree of brutality"

USA.saf.war.missions.15.t:0 "The Fall of East London"
USA.saf.war.missions.15.desc:0 "Despite the increasing involvement of the United States, it seems the scales are tipping in German favor. Today, the Afrika-Schild managed to fully occupy the city of East London: after a string of defeats suffered by the OFN coalition in the East, the Boer insurgent army, supported by several elements of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, had pushed the frontline far enough to threaten the core of the South African Federation. Despite losing its status of an economic center due to the years of apartheid, which saw most of its white population leaving for greener pastures, the city was still an important logistical junction, allowing supplies from Cape Town and the increasingly frequent American shipments to directly reach the eastern front.\n\nThe city had been heavily fortified for the coming assault, with several artillery and anti-aircraft emplacements scattered in the many squares and parks dotting the city, while the outskirts had been torn down and replaced with interlocking bunkers, trenches and minefields. Still, this wasn't enough to hold off the attackers, as the joint German-Boer task forces used napalm and heavy artillery to clear the outer defenses, creating a breach large enough for the close quarters specialists to reach their intended targets. The garrison fought back valiantly, with important support from those civilians who preferred to fight and die rather than live in slavery, but in the end they were forced to concede more and more ground, until a last defensive line was hurriedly formed around the harbour: all possible supplies were loaded on any availabe ship to not let it fall in German hand, but many were left behind and had to surrender and face the war prisoners' camps.\n\nThe American commander in South Africa has vowed to "free the people from the national socialist yoke", and already rumors are starting to circulate about heavier investments in the war, but this defeat is drawing heavy criticism for how the American expedition was ill-prepared for this conflict, and many doubt that the tides of war will change. Is this the end for freedom in Africa?"

USA.saf.war.missions.16.t:0 "The Recapture of East London"
USA.saf.war.missions.16.desc:0 "Perhaps the fall of East London finally let the South Africans and their American allies understand the seriousness of the situation. They say that, in desperate times, people do extraordinary things, and this proved true once more, as a full-scale counterattack, ordered by the joint General Staff of the coalition, managed to liberate the city after a hard-fought battle: the arrival of new reinforcements from the United States proved instrumental in retaking the city, showing once more how invested they are in the war, something which drew diplomatic protests from the mainland Reich.\n\nThe Germans had bunkered in the city, erecting makeshift fortifications and turning the outskirts into a death zone with booby-traps and minefields: uncaring for the civilian population, they had torn down several blocks to have clear firing lines and dig trenches. In the end, however, this wasn't enough, and the heavy bombardments destroyed most outer defenses, forcing the garrison to fall back to the opposite end of the city, where they had already prepared for the retreat. Under the cover of darkness, most of the Germans and high-ranking Boer officers abandoned the city, leaving behind only a token force to delude their enemies into thinking they were still fighting. The ruse was discovered only the next day, when the Americans attacked and found almost no resistance.\n\nEven though the victory was less of a triumph than hoped for, this still comes as a success for the OFN coalition after a long time without any meaningful success. While it is clear in Washington that the war will still drag on, at least total defeat is no longer a likely outcome, which is already a result."

USA.saf.war.missions.17.desc:0 "Today, a devastating blow has been struck against South Africa as Cape Town, the Federation's capital and largest city, fell to a joint task force of Boer and Südwestafrikaner soldiers. The last weeks had seen the American-led coalition suffer defeat after defeat, losing several key settlements to the Afrika-Schild, until the front reached the very heart of the country. Now, that heart has stopped beating.\n\nThe hills surrounding the "City Bowl" were turned into fortresses linked by trench lines, fully enclosing the Cape in a ring of heavy fortifications. The city itself had extensively prepared for the coming attack, with barricades and key locations garrisoned by volunteer units, and American artillery and anti-aircraft batteries scattered throughout the roads and squares. However, even such preparations weren't enough to resist as the entirety of the German war machine was thrown at the defenders. Boer artillery, supplied by their German allies, surgically removed a large part of the air defenses, and then Südwestafrikaner bombers unleashed hell upon the city in the form of incendiary bombings and bunker-busting payloads. Table Mountain and the Twelve Apostles were riddled with craters, while Signal Hill was captured and turned into an advanced artillery position to fire directly into the inner urban areas. In the end, the pressure became too much, and the joint High Command ordered a full retreat from the city by sea.\n\nWith the fall of its capital, South Africa loses also its largest industrial center and recruitment pool, severely crippling the war effort. In Washington, the American government is currently under attack by several newspapers and prominent opposition politicians, who decry the "useless sacrifice of American lives" and ask for total disengagement from this "humiliating disaster". Meanwhile, as the ashes cool down, the new Boer military administration, helped by German personnel, has already started implementing apartheid. The South African government, evacuated from the city before the attack, has promised to retake the city, but is this still possible?"

USA.saf.war.missions.18.desc:0 "Perhaps the war isn't over yet, and there's still some fighting spirit in the South African Federation. In what came as a sudden change to the one-sided course of the war, the last reserves of the Federal army, heavily supported by elements of the American Navy and driven by determination bordering on desperation, launched a full-scale offensive against their capital.\n\nThe new occupants of the city hadn't had the time to repair the fortifications surrounding the city, and were forced to fight in ruined bunkers and half-buried trenches. At the same time, a general uprising from the population, who hadn't been taking well the newly imposed apartheid, forced the Boer command to divert several units from key locations around the ring of forts, further weakening the already too strained defenses and finally forcing a geneal retreat from the hills. With the defenders surrounded from all sides, the officer in command finally surrendered in the morning: the coalition troops entered a wounded, but jubilant city, while their enemies hurried to reach their captors before they could be lynched by the enraged mob.\n\nThis victory comes as an utterly unexpected development in a war that already defies all known parameters: the German war machine has suffered a strong blow, and the industries of Cape Town will be a boon for the South African army as soon as they are repaired, returning a modicum of autonomy to an army which now completely depends on American supplies. At this point, no one knows whether this will be the proverbial swansong before ultimate defeat, or the beginning of the comeback for the Federation."

Tens of thousands will be requested to join the army and, after their training is over, will depart for the frontline. Everyone knows many of them won't return, and this has caused widespread protests as many fear their loved ones will be among the victims: spontaneous marches and picket lines can be already seen in large cities, but the harshest backlash has come from the drafted themselves.\n\nRather than showing what [USA.GetLeader] has called "proud American spirit", thousands of college students and other young men have filled the streets, openly burning their draft cards and loudly protesting against an administration that, in their opinion, has "destroyed their dreams and replaced them with war". Of course, the opposition has immediately offered support to the protesters, promising their potential voters that their first concern will be the end of this "illiberal and useless measure", which they claim "receives the backing of profiteers and kleptocrats".\n\nSlowly, painfully, the police is restoring control, and the draft has resumed when it became clear that all those who refused to present themselves to the barracks will spend enough time in prison to completely forget about college. Still, it has appeared clear that the escalation of the war is seen with hostility and dissatisfaction by the general population of America, something which should drive the President towards a quick and victorious conclusion of this bloody conflict."

He's studied the examples of our allies and enemies alike, across four continents, and he's published a number of impressive internal memos about the present situation in the Middle East. Someone like him would be invaluable on the ground during the present crisis, especially to help train and guide the freedom fighters of the Arab world. However, we're in a bit of a bind. There are a number of high-priority conflicts currently raging in the Middle East, and only one Colonel Schwarzkopf. Some in the Pentagon have proposed that he lead a small mission to the Baathist fighters in Egypt, to aid in their struggle against the Saudi-backed theocrats and Italian Empire alike. Having a friend near the Suez Canal wouldn't be a bad idea. At the same time, his efforts could also bear fruit in Syria's current independence struggle, especially with the country's oil fields and strategic location.

And after a long, seatrest-gripping flight over warzones and the anti-aircraft guns of a dozen factions, Stockholm to Hama.\n\nHama was a beautiful, ancient city, tightly clustered along the Orontes River. Minarets and clock towers pierced the skyline, gardens bloomed among its marble ruins, and giant metal water wheels still turned with the river's flow. But Hama was also at war. Flying in low over the Ghab Plain, the pilots could see all the signs. Gun emplacements, burned farms, bombed-out villages who'd had the rotten luck to meet the Turkish Army on a bad day. Or maybe it had been the Baathists who'd done that. "Doesn't matter either way," thought the copilot. He'd seen the same stuff in Namibia.\n\nFinally, the plane touched down at Hama Airbase. The airstrip was little more than packed dirt, and one of the three steel hangars had been demolished by artillery. Out on the "tarmac", the general was waiting. Mohammed Ziad al-Hariri was stout, with a receding hairline and an easy smile. He deployed it as Colonel Schwarzkopf stepped out of the plane.

It wasn't a true backwater, and to villagers throughout the governorate, it was still "el-madina", but most residents could feel the malaise in the air.\n\nNobody aboard the unmarked Learjet, cutting through the chilly night, knew about this. As it touched down on the makeshift airstrip, set up on the other side of the Nile from Beni Suef, a cadre of Baathist officers stood at attention. A small group of American soldiers hustled down the airstair, followed by the man of the hour. Deep-set eyes, a vast American chin, and a colonel's eagle on his uniform.

On the other hand, the Italian Empire seeks to hold onto its power in the region, for its imperial prestige and ENI profits.  But, at the same time, both have found themselves struggling against the nascent forces of Arab republicanism.  From Yemen to Syria to Egypt, army officers and ideologues alike are taking up arms in defense of national sovereignty, and against the despots of the past.  We should throw our support behind these brave souls, and ensure that the Middle East is independent and free for all.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, victory will bring with it access to the world's greatest reserves of oil.  "
USA_There_Will_Be_Blood_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences.  Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis.  To do this, we should support the rebels that, across the Arab world, have taken up arms in the name of freedom.  It is vital that we support them against the tide of Saudi and Italian bullets.  Yes, the outcome may be violent, but the established hegemons in the Middle East will be beaten by our proxies and cowed by our resolve.  Such an effort would be well worth it."
USA_Make_Ready_For_War_desc:0 "Diplomatic communiques alone won't help our allies in the Middle East.  If we're going to help liberate the nations of the Arab world, we'll have to send some firepower their way.

One of the most well-known of these, especially among the ranks of the Army, is Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.  Colonel Schwarzkopf is a student of guerrilla tactics and resistance movements, and is well-positioned to help the nascent rebellions that have sprung up across the Middle East.  He's one of our top men, and sending him into the field would undoubtedly boost our allies' efforts significantly.  Nearly two centuries ago, a young Frenchman named Gilbert du Motier sailed to America, to help liberate our young nation.  Colonel Schwarzkopf, one might say, is our answer to his legacy."
USA_Assess_Their_Politics_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second.  Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open.  Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations.  For the most part, this is acceptable.  There is a war to be won, after all, and not all niceties can be preserved.  At the same time, though, we are the Organization of FREE Nations.  Moreover, our arms shipments and diplomatic cover are in large part responsible for the survival of these forces.  We can certainly stand to assess the internal politics of our allies, and try and push them towards a more pluralistic form of government.  Why else are we here, if not to push freedom's power ever further?"

Now, with our new intervention in the Middle East, we have the opportunity to put those lessons to good use.

In the grand scheme of things, it's fairly cheap, with the potential for major benefits.  The efforts of these soldiers of fortune could go a long way towards achieving victory for our allies."
USA_Merchants_of_Death_desc:0 "Diplomatic support is a welcome boost for our allies.  Money, advisors, and even foreign mercenaries are even more welcome.  But at the end of the day, wars are won with firepower, and while our hands are officially tied by the bonds of congressional oversight, the CIA has a wealth of experience with ensuring that guns get where they're needed.  Embargo, emshmargo.  Our allies will get all the weaponry and ammunition they need, and both the Arabs and our own geopolitical position will benefit.  And if some of those guns help to secure oil fields, well, so much the better."
USA_Across_The_Burning_Sands_desc:0 "America's presence in the Middle East has certainly ramped up over the past several months, but by comparison to the Italians and Saudis, it's still fairly paltry.  That must change.  We must send new, large-scale contingents of "military advisors" to support our allies in their fights against fascism and Islamism.  On the ground, our firepower, tactics, and good old-fashioned American tenacity will surely demolish the enemy proxies.  Our intervention will be felt from Riyadh to Rome, and beyond.  There is a strong will for democracy in the Arab world, and America will ensure its security, by any means necessary."
USA_Smother_the_Flames_desc:0 "Collaboration with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia might present itself as a lucrative option, but it is one with the potential for unknown blowback and unforeseen consequences.  Instead, we should exercise our own influence in the Middle East, disrupting the Italians and standing against the Saudis.  To do this, we should work on winning hearts, minds, and wallets across the region.  Independence movements will be supported, victimized populations will be assisted, and new, strong, and free nations will be supported in the Arab world.  Their prosperity, and their stability, will be our gain."
USA_Stabilize_the_Situation_desc:0 "Our allies in the Arab world need all the help that we can provide.  That much is certain.  However, the niceties of congressional oversight and the proclivities of public opinion make any offer of direct military aid all but impossible.  That doesn't mean that we can't assist them, though.  Shipments of non-lethal equipment such as binoculars, camouflage, vehicles, and body armor should be one of our top priorities.  In addition, food and medical supplies can benefit both our allies' forces on the ground AND the civilians who have been put in harm's way by the fighting.  Such efforts will communicate our commitments in the Middle East, while also earning some positive news coverage.  After all, we're sending them butter, not guns.  Who could have a problem with that?"
USA_Operation_Desert_Shield_desc:0 "Throughout the bloody wars that have torn the Middle East apart, one constant has been the use of air power by outside powers, seeking to bolster their proxies in the Arab world.  Such air power has given them an advantage, but it's also had disastrous consequences for civilians on the ground.  No longer.  Using aircraft carriers stationed in the Indian Ocean, we can declare a series of no-fly zones over conflict areas.  It will certainly be a slap in the face to powers like Italy, who have enjoyed years of uninterrupted hegemony in Arab skies, but countless lives will be saved, and American prestige will surely be bolstered."
USA_Help_The_Refugees_desc:0 "From Syria to Yemen to Egypt, and beyond, tens of thousands of civilians have been forced from their homes.  Whether it's from the countryside to cities, from province to province, or from country to country, there are massive populations of displaced innocents who are in desperate need of assistance.  The United States is in an excellent position to provide that assistance.  Our freighters and transport planes can be tasked to send civilian medical teams, food aid, and even creature comforts to the refugee camps that are springing up across the region.  It's the right thing to do, and more importantly, it will produce a tsunami of positive PR for our involvement in the Middle East."
USA_Guns_For_Democracy_desc:0 "If truth is the first casualty of war, then democracy may be the second.  Many of our new allies, whether rebel armies or nascent states, tend not to be particularly free or open.  Military strongmen dominate governments, while militias act... rashly, shall we say, towards civilian populations.  We can do better.  Our unique position, as their primary source of supplies and diplomatic backing, gives us a great deal of leverage.  We can hold the carrot of renewed aid, in return for liberalization of governance and accountability for abuses by military forces.  It wouldn't need to be substantial, as long as it was public.  If not, there's always the threat of being left out in the cold.  That would be the stick."
USA_The_Desert_Scouts_desc:0 "The violence that the people of the Arab world have been facing as of late is intolerable.  While our air interdiction efforts and humanitarian aid have certainly born fruit, we need to work further to stabilize the Middle East.  One new proposal is to use American helicopters as a way to patrol far inland, when regular airpower would be imprecise or insufficient.  Helicopters are generally much more versatile, and can be used to transport everything from medicine to information to tactical units.  Such a "desert scout" program would initially consist mainly of American "blue suits", but with a bit of time, we can train our allies to fly as well.  These patrols would undoubtedly yield excellent results on the ground."
USA_The_Hand_of_Kindness_desc:0 "War is hell, and war is destructive.  While many states in the Middle East had already been struggling with developing modern infrastructure commensurate to their roles in the global economy, these recent wars have only made the issue worse.  This is an issue that we can address.  American investment, materiel, and engineering expertise can pave new highways, build new bridges, and upgrade rail lines in territories controlled by our allies.  This will improve our ties, but in a region gripped by war, such programs would also provide a measure of stability."
USA_Sending_Them_Experts_desc:0 "Another one of war's casualties, too often, is knowledge.  The Middle East has experienced a continual brain drain over the past several decades, as fascist colonialism and destabilizing wars have ruined the academic talent pools of the Arab world.  By offering new scholarships to students from allied nations, and investing in research institutions, we can help ensure that the lands which gave us the House of Wisdom retain their intellectual strength.  To secure the future, we must teach the present."
USA_A_More_Direct_Approach_desc:0 "At the end of the day, America is involved in the Middle East.  Our officers help train forces in Egypt, our cargo planes supply refugees in Syria, and our cruise missiles protect the cities and towns of Yemen.  We cannot ignore it, and as these wars against fascism and Wahabism continue to exact a bloody toll on the Arab world, it is clear that placing some boots on the ground is necessary.  It will likely result in some protest at home, in the papers and in the streets of Washington, but America's regional interests are on the line, and American prestige must be preserved.\n\nJust so long as we can devise an exit strategy."

Meanwhile, Americans of all stripes watch their television screens with undisguised anxiety.  The assassination of Martin Luther King has set off a vast chain reaction of fury, grief, and destruction, and nobody is quite sure where it will end."

South Africa's fires rage heedless of the man in the White House, burning Nazis, civilians and, more pressingly, American soldiers alike. The American people have elected President [Root.GetLeader] in large part to bring them home posthaste.\n\nCongress has split into two sides over when to pull our boys out of the Veld. The "Interventionists", led by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, argue that bringing more of them for large-scale offensives will finally break the Schild's back and end the war soon. Chairman of House Foreign Relations Donald Rumsfeld and his "Technocrats" advocate leaving only our best behind with better leadership, doctrines, weapons systems and intelligence instead of risking a gruesome war of attrition.\n\nWhoseever advise the President listens to shall become America's strategy going forward. Thousands of families, both of servicemen and of potential draftees, pray he decides rightly."

People have to feel safe in their homes and communities, or else all trust in this coalition will collapse.  Thus, the Pentagon has proposed the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support Program, aka CORDS.  By assigning training personnel and funding to local communities, we can build up local security forces.  This will give us additional cachet on the ground, and additional manpower to help combat a variety of insurgents.  Civilians that feel secure and in control of their local environments will be better allies, and CORDS can help to make that happen."

These are vicious guerillas who strike when least expected, and sow chaos both behind and at the front lines.  Werewolf activity is devastating for morale, and we need to get a handle on it immediately.  The brass is proposing the Phoenix Program as a solution.  This program would involve forming joint counterinsurgency units to go into potentially hostile areas and eliminate Werewolf activity, by any means necessary.

Or worse, brother Tommy hosing down POWs in a fit of rage.\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] has thus directed the Signal Corps to tone down the news filtering back into the States a little - say, that morale is high, casualties are low, and the war's ending soon.

When further inquired of the steps needed to save South Africa, his proposal was anything but.\n\nFounts of tabulated data, calculated extrapolations, and above all cold, hard numbers flowed freely from Ford's brightest Whiz Kid. The erudition he demonstrated had rooted logic into the war's vagueries and made them answerable with actionable solutions - "...the most effective among them," he concluded, "being an escalation of our presence by several orders of magnitude than current. The costs are high, but their countervailing benefits are incalculable."\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] was swayed by McNamara's concise arguments and clear-sighted goals, and shall take his advice into firm account henceforth."

What were once guarantors of the country's warmaking assets have now taken a new primary role as the guarantors of many a politician's careers, and their districts' allegiances to boot. Said politicians return the favor by inflating our budget every fiscal year or so, letting Boeing, McDonnell and North American gorge themselves fat on the excess - like spiders having their fill of succulent flies.\n\nNevertheless, these spiders bear sharp fangs and potent poison. Their weapons of trade can be put to better use paralyzing the Nazis' industries and supply lines instead of bogging ours to near-uselessness. Subsidizing new factories for America's military-industrial web, especially in swing districts, will allow us to benefit from both of the two heads it now sprouts."

Heavy bombardment was a theoretical portfolio never quite put to practice even by its predecessors; seeing targets of opportunity in Windhoek, Léopoldville and Quelimane, its proponents have advocated testing on Nazi Africa the extensive bombing campaigns they had once envisioned for Nazi Europe.\n\nDiscussion over the collateral damage these campaigns will accrue has thus far been sidelined in lieu of ending the war as soon as possible.

RD_SAF.4.desc:0 ""If you'll turn to Appendices A-D, Mr President."\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] skipped to the aforementioned section on his copy of SecDef McNamara's hundred pages-thick report. His lips pursed thin as he scanned its tables and graphs: casualty estimates, as he'd come to expect, annotated with recommendations - "increase in flight hours", "expanded volume of ordnance", "strategic use of incendiaries" - and their "corresponding improvements". If it had a name, the report had an exact number and unit on mention.\n\nMcNamara didn't just put numbers into Nixon's war; he had turned death into variables a man can add and subtract, multiply and divide. As expected of Ford's brightest Whiz Kid, in hindsight. Perhaps he viewed the conflict as a car plant with faults to solve, and the men involved no different from spare parts on a manager's requisition list. That would at least explain the data charts taking up near-half this mammoth of a document. But did the President himself?\n\nFrowning, he turned towards the Secretary. "So," he began, "this... campaign, of yours. How many will we lose?"\n\n"Around a hundred," replied McNamara coolly, "including escorts. Well within acceptable margins."\n\n"And how many will they lose?"\n\nA ghost of a smile graced the dispassionate statistician lips. "Several orders of magnitude more."\n\nThe commander-in-chief sighed. Then again, McNamara did have both a plan and a target, questionable they may be. Far better than having none at any rate - so he approved."

It is manned by a crew of six, can travel 6,400 nautical miles without refueling, and has a flight ceiling of 45,000 feet - several thousands higher than than the Me 262. Recent modifications to its bomb bay have allowed for a maximum payload of either four Mark 39 thermonuclear bombs or 60,000 lbs of conventional bombs such as the Mk-82 and -84.\n\n"At current, Eighth Air Force has around 170 units split between three air wings based in Minot and Barksdale AFB. They will form the backbone of the offensive Gen. LeMay has discussed an hour prior."\n\n"How much damage do they deal?" interrupted the President. McNamara nodded to the projector's operator.\n\nTwo photographs replaced the bomber's schematics. The left photo depicted groupings of square and rectangular roofs, separated by roads. Large patches of farmland circumscribed the small cluster of civilization. One can conclude from said features that the photo was that of a village, with perhaps several hundred inhabitants.\n\nThe same can't be said for the right photo, which showed only craters and rubble."

Grow up."\n\n"Enough."\n\nEveryone's eyes turned to the President.\n\n"Everyone, get out.  I appreciate your input.""

#Indonesia CW Focus Tree Descriptions
 USA_RD_burning_jungle_desc:0 "Indonesia is aflame, what is the situation?"
 USA_RD_pick_up_red_phone_desc:0 "Given that both of us are nuclear powers, it stands to reason that we must tread carefully when interfering with the Co-Prosperity Sphere. While Japan seems to be controlled by level-headed men, we must still be careful to toe the fine line between isolationism and being mavericks.\n\nWe will place a call to the Japanese on the red telephone. We will assure them that we have no interest in sending Japanese boys home with American bullets in them. Yet, our commitment to democratic movements around the world brings upon us a moral obligation to support those who fight for freedom in Indonesia. Reminding them of Indonesia's technical independence and sovereignty, we will caution them against launching an intervention into the East Indies and remind them that threatening the freedom of a sovereign people may have dire consequences."
 USA_RD_pick_up_red_phone_effect:0 "§OBy taking this focus, America will begin its involvement in Indonesia, and will face consiquences depending on how this conflict will end§!\n"
 USA_RD_work_the_backchannels_desc:0 "Open armament of Free Indonesia may be a bridge too far for the moment. Nonetheless, equipment has often found its way into the stockpiles of rebel movements throughout the world. If American equipment were to find itself in Hatta's hands, well, that would surely be just a coincidence...\n\nWe shall open back-channels of communication and transport between Hatta and the United States. We shall ensure Hatta gets his hands on some premium American equipment. Hopefully, this will help turn the tide in the Indonesian war."
 USA_RD_secure_supply_lines_desc:0 "Every army travels on its stomach, and Hatta's is no different. His men need food, his trucks need fuel, and his guns need cartridges. America will gladly provide all of these.\n\nWe will use our positions in the Pacific, particularly Australia, to secure supply lines to the liberated zones of Indonesia. With our help, Hatta's men will want for nothing. We can only hope Japan is less generous to Sukarno than we are to Hatta."
 USA_RD_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_RD_send_advisers_desc:0 "The war has dragged on longer than we hoped, and we have no choice now but to escalate. Where once, we merely assisted Hatta's army, now it's time to fight alongside them.\n\nWe will send a full division of US troops to Indonesia in an "advisory" role. While these will merely be volunteers, they will be fighting in the thick of it defending the Indonesians on their left and right. This move will allow us to take a more direct role in the Indonesian war effort."
 USA_RD_hidden_hand_desc:0 "Our "advisors" have been making excellent progress in the Indonesian war effort, yet Sukarno's henchmen have proven rather intractable. Perhaps it is time to use our new forward base and naval routes to enlarge our commitment in Indonesia.\n\nAnother division of "advisors" will be deployed to aid Hatta. This will still be done under the guise of volunteer assistance of the Free Indonesian administration, that our "hidden hand" in the conflict may continue to be obscured."
 USA_RD_war_of_words_desc:0 "As the Indonesian conflict unfolds, it is critical that we control the conversation surrounding it. While the American everyman might not have much of a reason to care about Indonesia, by framing the situation as a struggle against our Japanese enemy, we might win their hearts and minds.\n\nWe will hit the airwaves and ensure that the world and our own people both know the righteousness of Hatta's cause. This will induce our people at home to sympathize with the Indonesian struggle for freedom, as well as assure the Free Indonesians that we have their back."
 USA_RD_united_we_stand_desc:0 "The Indonesian War is not a vanity project for the US alone, but a cause the whole OFN can get behind. We can't shoulder the burden of aiding Hatta alone, it's time for the OFN to contribute to the liberation of Indonesia.\n\nWe will call in support from the OFN. Not volunteers, that's a bridge too far, but we will secure substantial equipment donations from our member states. Hatta's men will be armed with weapons from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand. This will hopefully greatly aid their independence struggle."
 USA_RD_expand_the_fleet_desc:0 "In 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay and forced the Japanese to end centuries of isolation from the world. He accomplished this by having a massive armada of the finest warships sailing behind him. Naval intimidation of the Japanese worked once, we pray it shall work again.\n\nWe will start insisting on double shifts at our dockyards. Fleet production will ramp up considerably so that our ships may be commissioned more quickly. Hopefully, we'll be able to spook the Japanese with our resurgent Navy."
 USA_RD_force_their_hand_desc:0 "The Japanese control the Indonesian skies. Sukarno's men fly above and rain hell on Hatta's men below. The Sphere's aerial dominance is unquestioned. \n\nPerhaps it's time to question it.\n\nWe will send fighter jets and CAS equipment to Hatta. He will now be able to boast a powerful air squadron to challenge Japanese air superiority. Of course, this may tip Japan over the edge..."
 USA_RD_arms_production_desc:0 "The Indonesian conflict is more demanding than we realized. Our existing military factory output is insufficient to meet the needs of Hatta's men, as Sukarno has dug in more deeply than we expected.\n\nBut that's easy to solve.\n\nWe will send over engineers to Free Indonesia to construct a major military production complex as swiftly as possible. This will be a small boost to the Free Indonesian arms output, but hopefully enough to turn the tide against Sukarno. "
 USA_RD_forward_base_darwin_desc:0 "Australia is our closest ally to the Indonesians. The Northern tip of the country has one quite populous city, Darwin. This area could serve as an important launch point for any actions taken in the South Pacific.\n\nWe will offer to construct vast fortification networks in Northern Australia in order to brace for the conflict coming to their shores. These bases will also be excellent points from which to deploy troops to Indonesia."
 USA_RD_emergency_naval_training_desc:0 "I don't know if you've ever looked at a map, but there is no land route from the United States to Indonesia. Consequently, the Navy will be essential for any operations to assist Hatta, and it is all too important that the Navy be ready to carry them out.\n\nWe will launch emergency naval exercises to prepare our seamen for Indonesian operations. This may allow us to better update our naval warfare doctrines should we come into any conflict on the open seas. Hopefully the Japanese aren't foolish enough to let things get to that point, but we must nevertheless be prepared."
 USA_RD_ready_the_airforce_desc:0 "Our airmen are eager to deploy into Indonesia, but they need a base to deploy from first. Darwin has already been fortified for defense, but now it must be equipped for aerial operations.\n\nWe will send engineers to Australia to hastily construct air bases that are large enough for sizable air deployments. Their proximity to Indonesia shall allow us to aid Hatta's men from above, and deploy more squadrons than ever before."

 USA_NPP_ready_the_australians_desc:0 "Nixon, coward that he was, envisioned a policy of "containment" of Japanese imperialism. He would have used Australia as a forward operating base for US troops to provide an assistance role to Hatta. But we in the NPP know that the Organization of Free Nations ain't free. The Aussies ain't here to be a mere base of operations, they're going into the breach by our side.\n\nWe will put a call to the Aussies and tell them to ready their men for intervention in Indonesia. We'll get them fired up and ready to run through the jungle. We'll also send them some equipment too, in case they need it."
 USA_NPP_mandatory_naval_training_desc:0 "The purpose of the US Navy isn't just to move troops from point A to point B. It's not just a series of carriers for our planes. No, the Navy is a powerful tool in our diplomatic arsenal. It's the cannon that will fire the Marine Corps at Sukarno and keep the Japanese at arm's length.\n\nWe will conduct emergency Naval exercises to prepare the USN to starve Sukarno. Not only that, we will prepare our ships to deploy our forces on a moment's notice. Sukarno has no idea what he's in for, and the IJN would be well advised to stay out of the South Pacific while we operate..."
 USA_NPP_begin_the_blockade_desc:0 "The American people will not accept another South Africa. They do not want a long, protracted conflict that leads to horrible images on TV. They need not worry, we'll make sure Sukarno doesn't last long enough for us to get sick of fighting him. It's time to starve the beast.\n\nWe will cut Japan off from Indonesia. The USN will surround the East Indies, securing our supply lines and crippling Sukarno's. Our training will go a long way to making our Navy able to win the new Pacific conflict. Our Navy will be on high alert to stop any and all threats to Hatta's liberation struggle."
 USA_NPP_airforce_indonesia_desc:0 "Our naval supremacy in the East Indies has been entrenched through the blockade, but our air supremacy has yet to be established.\n\nYet.\n\nThe USAF will now begin emergency drills in preparation for the East Indies conflict. While on high alert, they will be far more effective at controlling the skies and aiding Hatta's ground troops."
 USA_NPP_south_africa_lessons_desc:0 "The conflict in South Africa taught us much about asymmetrical warfare in the late 20th century. Our troops are battle-hardened, and our attaches may have useful insights to offer Hatta's freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send US Army Rangers to teach the Free Indonesians entrenchment tactics to improve their defensive capabilities against Sukarno. We will also teach them logistical techniques that will improve their mobility and ability to stay organized while on the march."
 USA_NPP_send_over_the_planes_desc:0 "We cannot control the skies alone. Our pilots are still only flying in a volunteer role. This proxy war cannot be one solely through the limited direct involvement Congress permits us, we will have to get Hatta's men up in the air alongside our own.\n\nWe will send fighter jets and CAS equipment to Hatta. He will now be able to boast a powerful air squadron to challenge Japanese air superiority. Of course, this may tip Japan over the edge, but they should have known better than to resist the march of democracy."
 USA_NPP_maximum_pressure_desc:0 "Indonesia's freedom is non-negotiable. There will be no détentes, no olive branches, no treaties. Either we seize the day and cut off Japan's main source of oil now, or we never will.\n\nTime to turn up the heat on Tokyo. We will hit them with a diplomatic onslaught. They will be made to know, in no uncertain terms, that we are in this to win this. Hopefully they will back down."
 USA_NPP_propaganda_leaflets_desc:0 "Hatta's men are well armed, at this point, yet not as motivated as we would like. We must win over the hearts and minds of the Indonesians, show them that now is the hour of their liberation....if only they rise up and claim it.\n\nWe will begin an intensive propaganda campaign across Indonesia. This will inspire more recruits to the Free Indonesian cause as well as improve the fighting spirit of Hatta's troops."
 USA_NPP_block_the_japanese_desc:0 "The IJN is massive in comparison to the USN. Even though we are better trained and suffer none of the interservice rivalry issues that plague Japan, we still are unable to match them pound for pound in naval output. Let's fix that.\n\nWe will immediately invest into our dockyards to rapidly construct new naval vessels. Hopefully, the increased output will allow us to finish ships we've currently queued up. This will enable our navy to more effectively uphold the Blockade and block the Japanese."
 USA_NPP_fan_the_fire_desc:0 "Our factories just keep churning out more and more guns. What good are they doing sitting in a warehouse stateside? Our troops back home have no one to shoot, but Hatta's men do! Let's give em something to shoot with.\n\nWe will send yet more guns to Hatta. Japan may not like this, but there's too much at stake in the Indonesian conflict for us not to fan the fires of war."
 USA_NPP_fan_the_fire_effect:0 "§OWe will equip some new Indonesian divisions§!\n"
 USA_NPP_freedom_fighters_desc:0 "Since we imposed the blockade, Hatta's factories have lacked for nothing. As our supplies continue pouring in, we should strike while the iron is hot and redouble our aid efforts to the Indonesian freedom fighters.\n\nWe will send over the material necessary to improve the construction output in the liberated zones. The jobs created by our expanded efforts should please folks on the home front, too."
 USA_NPP_everything_must_go_desc:0 ""Come on and get your guns! Help yourselves! Be my guest! No charge! Free samples! Guns guns guns! Once in a lifetime giveaway! Everything must go! We have grenades, take a whole crate! Do you want artillery? Well we got artillery! Do you want jeeps? Well if you fight for Hatta, you can have the whole motor pool! Don't forget your bullets! Everything goes for free!""
 USA_NPP_patriot_division_desc:0 "The namby-pamby R-Ds would exercise more "caution" before doing this, but we don't have the same constraints as the establishment. We aren't afraid to put our men in the thick of it with Hatta's. South Africa didn't scare us off of war, it just made us better at fighting it.\n\nWe will send a fully armed, fully trained, and fully American division to directly aid Hatta. This will be seen as an extreme escalation by the Japanese, but we see it as a challenge they'll inevitably back down from."
 USA_NPP_ship_over_industry_desc:0 "We have sent over industrial aid already, and it has been well appreciated. But we can do better, Hatta's men deserve better.\n\nWe will ship over yet more material to Free Indonesia. This time we will have a focus on constructing military factories.  This should hopefully ensure his men are well equipped."
 USA_NPP_to_the_end_of_the_line_desc:0 "We have the factories, we have the industry, and we have the will. We will not allow the American public to get weary about this war like they did with South Africa. We must escalate, and rapidly. We win this now or we lose this forever.\n\nAnother Patriot Division will be sent over. God willing, we will take out Sukarno once and for all. If not, there's no telling what Japan will do in revenge.\n\nAlea iacta est."

USA_RD_INS.01.t:0 "Sukarno's Folly"
USA_RD_INS.01.d:0 "The East Indies have exploded into civil war as the rivalry between President Sukarno of Indonesia and his opposition, led by Vice President Mohammad Hatta, have finally come to blows. Forces across the archipelago are mobilizing and taking sides, as various army regiments and resistance groups flock to the rebels. Already, protestors in major cities, having been broken up through force of arms, are retreating into the jungles to settle in for the long war.\n\nWhile some may be surprised to see the once-beloved Sukarno the target of a civil war, most expert observers have been anticipating such a conflict for years. Sukarno's increasingly dictatorial sway over Indonesia has soured opinion, both in the government and among the people, to the point where his own Vice President had become the greatest voice against him.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Japanese have declared support for their ally in the dictatorial Sukarno, but Free Indonesia is not without potential allies. Despite consisting mainly of hardline communists and Islamists, the rebellion has attracted much support in America from the anti-Japanese National Progressive Party. With such a vital part of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in flames, the United States stands in a unique position to weaken the Japanese stranglehold over Asia-- something that many Americans have been demanding for decades."
USA_RD_INS.01.a:0 "The Great Game for Asia has begun."

USA_NPP_INS.01.t:0 "The Battle Cry of Freedom"
USA_NPP_INS.01.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] stood before a massive press corps, combined with hundreds of citizens, in the auditorium of Johns Hopkins University. He shuffled around his speech notes as the audience eagerly awaited his words on the Indonesian conflict. This was the opportunity; the first chance America had to break the Japanese stranglehold over Asia. He had better make it count.\n\n"Fellow Americans... over the course of the past several weeks, a conflict of a momentous nature has erupted in the reaches of Southeast Asia-- in the island nation of Indonesia. There, as we speak, thousands of men and women are dying for a most righteous cause: the destruction of tyranny. A dictatorial shadow has encompassed that land, and now, an army of freedom-loving peoples are fighting to burn that shadow away."\n\n"...the cause of the Indonesian freedom fighters is one that America shall always support. As our forefathers fought in the valley of Pennsylvania, so too do their heroes fight in the jungles of Java and of Borneo. These men and women, engaged in such a righteous struggle, must not be allowed to fail. However, with the freedom-loving people of America standing behind them, they shall not. Indonesia shall be a free and democratic nation as God has ordained it to be. Together, the peoples of Indonesia and America shall see that tyranny is extinguished from this Earth!""
USA_NPP_INS.01.a:0 "Sic Semper Tyrannis."

USA_INS.01.t:0 "Indonesia Aflame"
USA_INS.01.d:0 "Our analysts' predictions regarding the East Indies have proven frightfully accurate. Sukarno's attempt at using martial law to solve the crisis with the PKI has been a dismal failure; after years of frustration with his despotic administration, liberal democrat Mohammad Hatta has risen up against Sukarno under the banner of "Free Indonesia."\n\nWhile Sukarno may stress that everything is under control, Hatta is moving swiftly to seize the country, having already taken large swaths of Aceh, Borneo, and Papua. This could be a critical opportunity for the United States to gain a new ally against Japanese domination of Asia, as long as we act quickly."
USA_INS.01.a:0 "The Jungle Burns"

USA_INS.02.t:0 "Our Position Secured"
USA_INS.02.d:0 "Today, after months of hard fighting across the archipelago, the Indonesian Civil War has come to an end, as loyalist forces surrender in droves and Sukarno's top generals formally declare the fight over. With Sukarno ousted, the popular front of Free Indonesia has taken power. Comprised of anti-Sukarno republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, this ragtag army proved too strong for the loyalist forces. Already, a democratic government is being set up in Jakarta with much of the former rebel leaders taking up leadership positions.\n\nWith the victory of Free Indonesia, the administration of [GetLeader] has seen a notable increase in popular approval. Having promised the defeat of Sukarno and the triumph of democracy, the President's promise appears to have become reality. Exactly to what degree the United States' support affected the Indonesian Civil War remains a matter of debate, but for now, America seems happy to see a favorable conclusion to the war."
USA_INS.02.a:0 "The jungle finally cools..."

USA_INS.03.t:0 "A Loss of Opportunity"
USA_INS.03.d:0 "Today, after months of hard fighting across the archipelago, the Indonesian Civil War has officially come to an end as the leader of the rebellion has surrendered to President Sukarno. From the balcony of a Jakarta government building, Sukarno delivered a speech, declaring the civil war to be finally over. The opposition forces, comprised of republicans, oppressed ethnic groups, communists, and Islamists, are now surrendering to the government in Jakarta en masse. Already, many of the leaders of the rebellion are being rounded up and then executed or sent to prison. \n\nWith the victory of Sukarno, and his autocratic grip over Indonesia tightened, the American public has become angered and distraught. After so many defeats over the past 20 years, it is still disheartening to see another flicker of liberty be extinguished. Most upset are those in the National Progressive Party, who blame Japanese intervention and a limp-wristed American response for the defeat of Free Indonesia. With another American boondoggle in Southeast Asia, it appears the political establishment in Washington may be harder pressed to keep their jobs in the next election."
USA_INS.03.a:0 "The Jungle Cools"

USA_NPP_INS.01.t:0 "Maximum Pressure"
USA_NPP_INS.01.d:0 "Anger among the National Progressive Party has come to a head this week with the official end of the Indonesian Civil War. Throughout the course of the war, many among the party had organized protests over American neutrality in the conflict, claiming that if the United States had involved itself, it would have been over much quicker and with far less bloodshed. Now, with the war over, any chance for the administration of [GetLeader] to redeem itself on this issue has passed.\n\nDespite claiming that the United States would support the cause of Free Indonesia against the Japanese-backed Sukarno government, President [USA.GetLeader] appears to have fallen through on his promise. No American support ever reached the anti-Sukarno forces in Indonesia, and many have claimed that the President simply allowed the Japanese to reassert their control over the archipelago. Leaders in the National Progressive Party are now calling the President weak, and demanding that a more anti-Japan stance be taken."
USA_NPP_INS.01.a:0 "Maybe we should have sent a little help."

USA_RD_INS.10.t:0 "An Unintended Joke"
USA_RD_INS.10.d:0 ""So what I'm saying, Lawrence, is that I think the United States simply has no business involving itself in Indonesia. Even if we squeak out a victory, I don't think we'll gain anything there an ally of dubious loyalty and the blood of a whole lot of American boys."\n\nLawrence E. Spivak cracked a slight smile, before realizing his interviewee was serious. "Congressman Cooper, you realize you are among an overwhelming minority in saying that?"\n\n"Yes, I do. There is no doubt in my mind that one day, we will look back on American intervention in Indonesia as a terrible avoidable mistake.""
USA_RD_INS.10.a:0 "Come now; how could the war possibly go poorly?"

USA_RD_INS.11.t:0 "Minor Protests in Washington"
USA_RD_INS.11.d:0 "There was a small protest along the National Mall today of less than 500 people against the recent deployment of American troops to Indonesia. The archipelago erupted into civil war this year, and the United States has officially intervened on the side of the forces fighting against the regime of President Sukarno. So far, the war has gone relatively well for the United States Marine Corps and Army forces who have been deployed there. There have been no major defeats, and generally, allied forces have been winning more and more victories.\n\nThe protest, largely led by students from Georgetown University and American University, focused on pacifism and the predicted loss of American lives overseas. The march was widely panned, particularly by Senator Strom Thurmond as "a bunch of youngsters who have no idea what they're talking about". Despite the political criticism, experts agree that sentiments expressed in the march are not exclusive to young college students, and that small-scale opposition to the Indonesian War may be seen across the country in coming months."
USA_RD_INS.11.a:0 "This one's going in their file."

USA_RD_INS.12.t:0 "A Bad Day in Berkeley"
USA_RD_INS.12.d:0 "Today, at the University of California, Berkeley, a protest against the Indonesian War turned violent as clashes between National Guard and police forces monitoring the march and the demonstrators themselves. One Berkeley student, whose name is unknown at this time, apparently threw a brick at a National Guardsman in full riot-gear. The brick missed, but still had an impact, as the National Guard raised their weapons and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas into the mass of students and protestors.\n\nBy the time the protest had been dispersed, more than 20 people had been hospitalized for injuries. Most unfortunately, however, was the case of student James Rector, who was shot with live ammunition by police and killed during the fighting. The violence has had a widely polarizing effect on the United States as a whole, with many calling the protestors thugs, and others calling them heroes. It also highlights the increasing unpopularity of the war in Indonesia and America's involvement in it."

USA_RD_INS.13.d:0 "Today, outside the gates of the White House, a pacifist quaker named Norman Morrison doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire. The man appears to not have screamed almost at all, despite the extreme pain, which suggested to investigators some kind of pain killing drug use. After all that remained was a charred corpse, however, the man's child, Emily, was found, with a note describing his reasons for suicide. He wrote that he had done this in protest to President [USA.GetLeader]'s involvement in the Indonesian Civil War, and that he set himself on fire in solidarity with the Indonesian and American boys who didn't choose a death by fire.\n\nThe public and political reaction can be described as nothing short of horrified. Thousands of people are now planning to "March for Morrison" and spread the ideas that he killed himself for. The President has yet to comment on the issue, but the White House is not letting in press at the moment. \n\nMorrison's death and the vast sympathy to it across the country appears to be part of a growing trend of Americans disliking the country's involvement in the Indonesian Civil War. While there is still a great number who call the anti-war demonstrators "traitors", more and more Americans say that the war is costing too much for too little. Whether or not the government will do anything remains to be seen, but if the anti-war movement has a dedication like Morrison's, it's unlikely that the government will have a choice."

USA_RD_INS.14.t:0 "America on Fire"
USA_RD_INS.14.d:0 "Over the past few days, many cities across the continental United States have erupted into violence following a massive series of organized and unorganized protests against the country. The demonstrations were meant to be against the widely-hated American intervention in the Indonesian Civil War, which has seen little returns for a great cost of lives. Reports claim that in many cities, violence was started by police told to disperse the protestors by any means necessary; in others, it appears protestors heard of violence in other cities and/or simply decided to start some themselves. \n\nThe violence is now beginning to calm down, and the cost appears to be astronomical. More than 50 Americans lay dead, all across the country, and hundreds or thousands have been hospitalized from wounds. It is evident from the sheer scale of the riots that the nation as a whole despises the war in Indonesia, and desires a complete end to the conflict."

honolulu_accords.1.desc:0 "The assembled Cabinet was silent, digesting the contents of the proposal before them. President [GetPresidentLastName] surveyed the room, knowing the enormity of the moment was giving everybody pause. \n\n"It's been twenty years since the end of the war, gentlemen," President [GetPresidentLastName] said. "A decade or so since Eisenhower tore up the Akagi Accords and admitted Hawaii to the Union. Now it's our turn to finish what he started." \n\nThe proposal - to stand up to Japan at last and to demand negotiations over the Treaty Ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles - would be the most ambitious and consequential diplomatic initiative by the United States in their lifetimes. The eyes of the world, and of the American electorate, would be scrutinizing them under a microscope. There would be no room for failure. \n\nThe Japanese wouldn't simply fold - but it was clear that holding ports halfway across the world, a diplomatic nightmare and impossible to secure, was increasingly unattractive. \n\nHow much could America push, without being pushed aside by Japan in return? It would take the political power of the American government to ensure the successful return of the ports, without giving away the house to the Japanese in the process - but a few concessions here and there might be useful in making demands further down the line..."

Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] ventured. "The Americans have finally worked up the nerve to ask for the Treaty Ports." \n\n"Ever since Eisenhower tore up the Akagi Accords, we had to know that this would come someday." The Foreign Minister sighed. "The Americans probably aren't seriously considering going to war for the Ports, but..." \n\nPrime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] nodded somberly. Twenty years after the victory in the Pacific, the ports were rapidly becoming more trouble than they were worth as Japan faced new challenges from every corner. If Japan could walk away from the negotiations with tangible guarantees - open trade, oil provisions, or an enforceable promise to formally recognize Japan's suzerainty over the Sphere - then what were two ports, really? \n\nIt would take every ounce of political and diplomatic capital to keep any deal as favorable to Japan as possible, even if they gave way on certain items to gain a temporary advantage to be used later.

honolulu_accords.10.desc:0 "Mr. President, we have started our negotiations with the Empire of Japan about the potential reacquisition of our California ports. One big problem between our nation and the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the fact that we do not trade enough. Because of this, the Japanese have demanded substantial amounts of oil to make up for their recent shortages. Simply put, the Sphere lacks many of the oil reserves that we have here in the United States. Luckily, the Japanese diplomats seem pretty desperate to sign a contract with us. If we grant them subsidized oil purchases, the economy of the Sphere will continue functioning and we may regain our lost ports. If we help out the Japanese and the Sphere helps us out, we could see a brighter relationship between our two great nations. We also have a chance of bringing American workers back to work for us.\n\nNow, the question of the moment is: how much oil will we give to the Empire of Japan? We could be generous and offer them the substantial amounts of oil they say they need. We could go down the middle and offer them a moderate amount of oil. Finally, we could give them small amounts of oil, but they may not accept the offer. We also need to consider what the Japanese plan to use the oil for. What do you say, Mr. President?"
honolulu_accords.10.a:0 "Give them as much oil as we can."

If we take this offer now, the oil will give the economy the boost it needs and our Imperial military shall be ever stronger. However, the amount of oil the Americans promise us seems too good to be true. The American diplomats have been quite the shady bunch surrounding this whole deal; we could try to request more oil to make sure they are telling the truth, but this plan could backfire quickly.\n\nPrime Minister, we have two options to take that could alter the course of the deal, and we must hurry before the Americans propose a counter offer."

We really thought the Japanese would be better negotiators than they turned out to be, but it seems we're still in the process of concluding this deal.\n\nWe've come upon three options for our response to Japanese demands: we either submit to their rather extortionate demands and continue the feelings of good will, persuade the Japanese that our original offer was enough, or end negotiations altogether and move on to the next topic of discussion.\n\nYour move, Mr. President"

These last few days were supposed to mark the end of Japanese oppression on the West Coast. The handing-off of the treaty ports was meant to symbolize the American eagle's rebirth onto the world stage as a bringer of democracy, a beacon of hope against the evils of Fascism. These negotiations were not just for the goodness of the peoples of San Francisco and Los Angeles, no, the Americans were going to gain much-needed prestige from the deal with Japan.\n\nThe Japanese, on the other hand, were handling a massive oil shortage across the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Diplomats hated stooping so low as to ask the United States for economic assistance; the Empire had triumphed over the States two decades ago, and now they needed their help? Wasn't this the problem that caused World War II in the first place? But they were desperate. Desperate for a resource that would fix the economic problems of an entire region. The negotiations showed that apparently, Japan was not desperate enough. And now, the oil crisis continues to strangle the Empire of Japan's economy, and the military-industrial complex is on the worst end of the situation.\n\nThe negotiations carry on, but the trade deal has been terminated."

No matter what, both parties hope that these negotiations will better relations between the two global superpowers. Workers both in California and the Japanese Home Islands rejoiced as the nations announced the completion of the deal.\n\nThough the trade deal was completed, the diplomats of the United States and Japan still have work to do.

They demand we pay a hefty sum of money for the return of the ports, and have made a deal on their transfer a condition for the resumption of trade. \n\n While placing this condition on what could've been a straightforward subject to resolve has outraged most of our delegation, with many calling for an immediate end to negotiations, cooler heads point out that access to the vast Asian markets is a prize well worth the cost.

Expressing outrage at our attempt to exact conditions for the return of the ports, they insist on dealing with the issues of trade resumption and port transfer separately. Their counter proposal is similar to our original draft, but has all references to the treaty ports removed. It seems clear that our respective stances are simply too far apart to reach a combined agreement, and our choice is between a mutual end to the embargoes with no further conditions, or no deal at all.\n\n How should we respond?"

Now the Japanese diplomats are sending us a harsh ultimatum: either we pay Japan money in exchange for the treaty ports or the Honolulu Accords will be canceled immediately.\n\nWe have to consider our next move in this argument. We can pay directly for the ports to be returned and not have to worry about paying subsidies to Japan. Alternatively, we could just end the meeting here and not give the Japanese anything. Nevertheless, diplomats on both sides are very eager to reach an agreement, and we must be swift in our response. What shall we do, Mr. President?"

It's obvious to everyone that no real rapprochement between our nations is possible while the Japanese occupy part of the American mainland, with all of the threats that imply, and the Japanese have indicated their willingness to return the Ports. The specifics of the transfer has been left to the end of the negotiations, and this will be the last clause up for discussion. We have a few options for how we position ourselves to approach these final negotiations. \n\nOur advisors fear that a straightforward transfer will be perceived in Japan as a loss of face, and that the politics of that perception might jeopardize the negotiations. To avoid this, they say, we should offer to demilitarize the ports upon transfer. By doing so we will ensure the Japanese have something they can point to as "getting in return" - enabling them to transfer the ports without appearing weak. \n\nOthers in our administration counsel a tougher approach. The goal of the whole summit, they say, is to turn a page on our relations with Japan, and that can only be accomplished if they agree not only to the port transfer, but to demilitarize Hawaii. With the Hawaiian Missile Crisis in all too recent memory, they claim the asymmetry of mutual threat will soon cause a rise in tensions back to previous levels as long as the Japanese garrison the island chain. Our most hawkish counsel suggests we can demand the demilitarization of Hawaii without offering to demilitarize the ports in turn. According to them, it's the only solution the man in the street will accept, and thus the only way to prevent future resentment from souring relations. \n\nWhat approach should we choose?"

The American delegation has opened the negotiations by sending a proposal for a conditional transfer where they pledge themselves to demilitarize the ports for the rest of the treaty period if we allow the transfer to go ahead. Most of our advisors consider this a favorable deal. It accomplishes our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA, while scoring us a victory in the form of demilitarization.\n\nSome, however, are saying that American willingness to accept such conditions betray the weakness of their position, and suggest we push to attach a second condition to the transfer - making the ports a special customs territory shared between our two nations. This will secure our traders and merchant fleets valuable bases of operations for their future American endeavors. It will also, however, provide ample opportunities for smugglers and will almost certainly be considered as onerous and unreasonable by the Americans.\n\nWhat should we tell their delegation?"

They want the ports to make up a "joint customs zone", effectively granting their merchants a jurisdiction in America.\n\nMany in our administration are outraged. If the purpose of the port transfer is to reobtain control over the ports, then accepting the "joint customs zone" defeats that purpose, allowing the Japanese to continue to have a say in the comings and goings of goods through the ports. We'd also open ourselves up to potential smuggling operations out of the zones. Accepting such a blatant power-grab would also encourage Japan to continue this "bad-faith" approach in future talks between our countries, according to these advisors.\n\nOn the other hand, this could be the final hurdle of the negotiations. Paying this price, however unreasonable we find it, will secure the port transfer. That might just be worth swallowing our pride. What should we do?"

Once they finished expressing their outrage, they informed us that a demilitarization is still on offer, a worthy price, according to them, we could obtain by agreeing to the transfer. \n\nMost of our delegates counsel accepting this deal as favorable and closing this clause. Predictably, there are a few voices that speak in opposition, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining national pride and a projection of strength, and demanding we secure compensation for the ports that "match the value of the blood spent" in securing them.\n\n However we respond, there's no further room for negotiation, so we should choose our reply carefully."

Japan's position and ours are simply too far apart on the issue for negotiations to proceed further, and it's better to move on before the deadlock puts any further strain on the negotiations. There is still a slim hope we will get the ports back, but that hinges on Japan judging our progress on the other two clauses to be important enough to reconsider their stance.

They pledge to keep the returned ports exclusively civilian, but ask that we demilitarize Hawaii in return. With the Missile Crisis in recent memory, they claim our forces on the island chain imply a threat to their country, which must be removed for normal relations to resume.\n\n Agreeing to this proposal will accomplish our main objectives of offloading the diplomatically burdensome ports and improving relations with the USA. According to our advisors, however, it is far from balanced. The docks in Hawaii are vital for our operational capacity in the East Pacific. Losing them will force us to choose between reduced operational space, which will surely anger our admirals, or constructing new docks on different islands, which will be expensive. The Americans have already more than replaced the docking capacity they lost when we occupied the ports, and are in no great need of them for their navies.\n\nSome in our delegation point out that while this particular clause may be unbalanced, we risk losing our gains in the earlier clauses should we push the Americans too hard on this issue. Are we willing to do that over a naval base?"

Flatly refusing to consider the merits of our proposal, they say that port transfer is the only issue up for discussion. Demilitarization is only a part of these talks as the condition for port transfer, they say, and they insist equally firmly on this condition and the complete impossibility of reciprocation. The Hawaiian Missile Crisis, they "remind" us, was caused by "American recalcitrance" and "our internal failures driving foreign policy decisions", and the onus is "entirely on the USA" to prevent a repeat of the event. \n\nMany in our administration point out that this arrogance is typical of the Japanese in their dealings with us. Discussions are completed on the clauses that matter to the Japanese, so they've reverted to their attitude of "victorious conquerors", dictating demands to a vanquished foe. If we accept their diktats, they say, we'll set up for them to continue their arrogant disregard for our interests in our future dealings as well. \n\nOn the other hand, the success of the summit hinges on us finding some way to accommodate both nations here, and we might need to give them this to prevent the negotiations from unraveling entirely. However we reply, there will be no room for further negotiations on the issue. What should we say?"

A "rebalancing of strategic threat", they say, is a prerequisite for a productive future relationship between our nations, and they seem willing to stake the outcome of the whole summit on getting it. \n\nOur delegation is united in condemning the arrogance of this demand. We are already willing to transfer the treaty ports and it's outrageous of them to demand more, they say. Hawaii is also a significant strategic asset, and demilitarization would lose both our navy and air force an important base. \n\nOn the other hand, we risk losing the economic benefits we've worked so hard to secure ourselves in the first two clauses.

We never agreed to discuss the status of Hawaii and are under no obligation to. Some of our delegation are calling for us to punish the Americans for their brash behavior by attaching conditions, including demilitarization, to the ports instead. Others see the demand as a bluff, the Americans trying to shore up their position for the negotiation, and suggest we offer up a bargain - we will demilitarize Hawaii, as they ask, if they will agree to limit the returned ports to civilian purposes as well. \n\nA few advisors are cautioning against seeing the proposal as a negotiation tactic.

The ports, and Hawaii for that matter, are American soil and we can't allow a foreign power to keep making demands and setting conditions for how we act on our own territory. If the Japanese want better relations, they can damn well accept that we won't allow them to keep waving Hawaii-based navies and missiles at our faces.

Regardless, it might be a price we should be willing to pay. Securing Hawaii would be a fantastic achievement for our government and for the USA, but beyond that, it would cement this treaty as the end of the era of hostility between us and the Japanese. \n\nThe last core US territory still occupied by Japan, its return will mark a true end to the war in the minds of the public and help usher a time of peace in the East Pacific."

He thought them confirmed when he entered the Oval Office and saw the President, back turned, inspecting a large canvas map of Hawai'i. The Minister drew in a sharp breath as he took a seat, steeling himself for the last conversation he ever wished to confront in his career.\n\n"I trust the accommodations here are to your liking?" President [GetPresidentLastName] asked without glancing back. The Foreign Minister grunted in assent. Not exactly proper decorum, but he figured the silence meant the President didn't care.\n\n"Good." Leather shoes clacked with polished linoleum as the President shuffled back to the Resolute Desk, pulling several folders out of its cabinet.

Both parties also consented to regular inspections by a bipartisan committee, ensuring the agreement's letter and spirit are enforced.\n\nWhere an otherwise ideal negotiation process met the realities of jockeying with a geopolitical adversary was when the frequency of such inspections was broached. Our diplomats, understandably, proposed that the committee convene in an annual basis.

The Japanese delegation's head responded by questioning the need for inspections lasting longer than a year. Their Western adversary's insistence was unperturbed by the dismissal.\n\nAfter several hours of debate (and several emptied bottles of hard liquor), the conference's attendants finally reached a consensus. Henceforth, a committee consisting of select officials and experts from both countries shall inspect Hawai'i and the Panama Canal Zone for breaches of terms..."

USA.hawaiinegot.7.t:0 "Regarding DMZ Violations"
USA.hawaiinegot.7.desc:0 "The next obstacle the conference would hurdle was how violations should be addressed. The Japanese delegation emphasized that all parties are bound by the agreement's terms; ensuring such requires appropriate retribution in the event that either party, irrespective of reason, fails to uphold said terms. "Laws are toothless without punishments," said the Japanese Foreign Minister, "and only sharp teeth suffice for treaties between two nations that can end the world with a button press."\n\nOur ambassadors were split on the issue. On one hand, clearly defined punishments for violations within the proposed DMZs disincentivize Japan from using them as de facto outposts for their Pacific-wide cordon sanitaire - provided, of course, that the same penalties apply to them. Those disinclined to trust the Empire's intentions argued that the punishments will be selectively, and aggressively, applied at our disfavor. (Additionally, a minority opined, stringent punishments will prevent us from justifying certain activities through "creative interpretation" of the agreement's terms. Future administrations may find themselves an option short should the need for action in the DMZs arise.)\n\nIn the end, the American delegation..."
USA.hawaiinegot.7.a:0 "...approved disciplinary measures for violating the agreement."
USA.hawaiinegot.7.b:0 "...failed to reach a satisfying compromise with the Japanese."

USA.hawaiinegot.8.t:0 "Regarding the Violations Clause"
USA.hawaiinegot.8.desc:0 "Fortuitously, the Americans also believed in assigning consequences to treaty violations. The final point of contention between both parties was how severe the consequences should be. Less fortuitously, fraying tempers skirted the breaking point at this juncture.\n\nThe last stretch between the negotiations and a lasting peace deal began with our fatigued delegation suggesting "harsh punitive measures" against the reneging country. When asked to clarify by the cautious Americans, they proposed actions ranging from remilitarizing the affected territories to establishing a full embargo. Even talk of declaring the Handover null and void gained traction among its more zealous members - that is, until their arguments were cut short by the meaty thwack of a face meeting fist.\n\nOrder returned to the conference room before the negotiations broke down under an inter-Pacific exchange of blunt force trauma. The Americans, now made both cautious and disheveled, presented their own counteroffer: economic sanctions and immediate withdrawal from all economic, military, and diplomatic agreements signed following the Handover. These will be resumed, they further explain, only when the offending party ceases their violations of the agreement. Efforts to extract more from the delegation was met with the enthusiasm of a stony brick wall.\n\nAs a new day peeked from the window blinders, Japan's diplomats reached their ultimate consensus:"
USA.hawaiinegot.8.a:0 "The Empire is content with the compromise."
USA.hawaiinegot.8.b:0 "The Empire's rivals deserve harder checks."

A small band that glowed dull against the fluorescent lamps wrung around its fourth finger. Less ornaments than his own and maybe several years more worn, but a wedding ring all the same.\n\nHe glanced at the conference room. Or what was a conference room. Shredded and whole paper covered every square inch of floorboard, topped by stray mug shards slick with drying pools of coffee and the stray blood smear. Its occupants fared little better; either they were dozing off where they stood or sat or laid, wincing at cuts and bruises covered in flimsy gauze pads, or both. 24 straight hours of wheeling and dealing a treaty had taken its toll. No doubt the Japanese were eager to leave with what they had, at least then they'll enjoy sleeping in cushions and for more than a few hours in the flight home.\n\nCan he say the same for his - that they were satisfied with what they had? Will his countrymen approve what he'd wrangled from the Empire when all's said and done? Or will both dig their heels and ask for more?\n\nThe Secretary then turned to the man with the outstretched hand, opposite his side of the long table. Stodgy with a bald spot, purple bags for eyes, a rotund belly protruding from an unbuttoned suit. He might as well have been a middle-aged salaryman coming home from overtime, rather than the Empire's premier representative abroad. Yet his tired smile and open palm seemed to offer a hope just as mundane: peace from across the aisle. The first in a very long time.\n\nNodding to himself, the Secretary of State..."

Those peers of his who saw only the summit on which he stood would cheer his fall, if not engineer such a tragic occurrence themselves. Hence, His Majesty's loyal servant treated his adversaries as an old boulder treats the moss which grow lush between its cracks.\n\n...He glanced at the Foreign Minister's letter, laid with neither crease nor tear on his desk. The Prime Minister allowed himself a sharp breath and clenched fist. Any more, he feared, would see the Americans' pristine, arrogant, disrespectful... response... suddenly parted sixteenfold.\n\nSpirits above, treading carefully was a harder task than he'd thought. Was not leaving duplicity unanswered more improper than expressing righteous anger against it? Putting paid to America's pretensions, if it protected the Empire's good faith from further abuse, certainly allured to him.\n\nBut he had his Minister's personal appeal to consider. Washington's erratic gestures might simply be a bluff of some sort, the man argued. The closest the Pacific ever has been to certain peace lay just beyond the Empire's fingertips, and will be theirs should it choose to reach out instead of reflexively withdrawing from an impermanent slight.

"I'd have thought that counts as bad news."\n\n"It means the Empire's willing to stick with what we've negotiated thus far- despite, may I remind you, their people's wishes. Maybe even its own government's."\n\n"So that's the bad news then? Cut to the chase, Mr. Secretary: where do you really stand? Us or them?"\n\n"Gentlemen."

As mushroom clouds ended one age and announced the next, many feared the Pacific will forever stay between twilight and Armageddon, kept in place by two ambitions greater than the expanse which they both contest.\n\nSuch fears were laid to rest today by a pair of disheveled ambassadors, all but bracing each other's enervated weights as they hobbled out of a hotel lobby.

If we are serious about our commitment to ensuring fascism is contained everywhere in the world, we must be as forceful and determined in our response to this civil war as we are in countries like South Africa and Indonesia. The US has always been and will always remain a steadfast ally of antifascists everywhere, and America has always been a true friend of Iran. We must look to organizing a response, we cannot let the fascists control the oil reserves there to fuel their evil empires."
USA_iranian_aid_bill_desc:0 "The House foreign policy committee has swiftly drawn up a bill authorizing dispatch of advisors, equipment and financial aid to Iran, as well as authorizing the government to advertise, organize and dispatch volunteer divisions from both veteran and active duty Army personnel. Once this goes through Congress, help will be on its way to the brave Iranians."
USA_american_aid_inbound_desc:0 "The Iranian Aid Act has been quickly rushed through Congress to ensure a timely response to the crisis there. An immediate loan of $100 million has been granted to the Iranian liberal faction so they can fund their armed forces until American equipment and volunteers can arrive en masse. Initial military advisors are to be dispatched as soon as secure flights can be established, followed by the equipment and then the volunteers. With some luck the Iranian liberal movement will soon be strong and economically stable, a force that can sweep aside the armies of tyranny opposing them."
USA_american_equipment_desc:0 "Coordinating with the Iranian liberals and our advisors, we have set up a pipeline for regular shipments of military equipment between California and Iran, using Australia as a go-between. Sadly, for the moments this limits our ability to send significant quantities for the gear, but the ability for the Iranians to use the remaining money from their loan to buy American weaponry and gear will certainly be a relief for both them and our domestic arms industry."
USA_american_military_advisors_desc:0 "The eagle soars once again to distant shores! Our advisor teams report the bulk of their teams have landed safely in Iran, and request we coordinate with the legitimate, freedom-loving Iranian government to ensure they have translators, staff and vehicles available."

Let us pull some strings at the congressional budget office to authorize further Liberty Loans to the Iranian liberals. No amount of money is worth a loss to fascist tyranny."
USA_send_in_cia_advisors_desc:0 "While not mentioned in the official Iranian Aid Act, in the black budget we have set aside money for advisors from REDACTED to instruct and share REDACTED with the Iranian REDACTED services. It is our REDACTED 's hope that this will lead to REDACTED, increased trust, REDACTED, REDACTED, higher recruitment of Persian-speaking operatives, REDACTED, and new perspectives on the regional intelligence situation, especially in regards to REDACTED."
USA_grand_strategy_of_the_iran_war_desc:0 "With the Iranian Civil War still dragging on, our administration finds itself on a crossroads. Should we commit fully, South Africa-style, with boots on the ground and a strong hand, or should we press on with the current strategy of primarily arming the Iranian liberals and letting them fight the war for us? We will need to carefully weigh whether the risk of upsetting the public with another foreign conflict is worth the risk of losing Iran to the forces of tyranny. The economic and geopolitical consequences of the fascists controlling the oil of Iran could be devastating, but a direct intervention can seriously undermine our popularity, not to mention our military budget plans. What should we do?"
USA_promise_more_american_soldiers_desc:0 "We have to go all in on this one, public opinion be damned.

USA_promise_more_american_equipment_desc:0 "We cannot risk another bloodbath like we faced in the jungles this decade. To limit the potential loss of American life without letting the Iranians down, we will instead announce an expansion of our current strategy, with efforts undertaken to greatly increase the quantity of weapons shipments to the Iranian liberals. This will be difficult, but we will be enjoying the cooperation and support of our military-industrial complex, which stands to benefit from the Liberty Loans being spent on their product line."
USA_to_free_the_oppressed_desc:0 "To help build popular support for our intervention in Iran, we have crafted a carefully staged media campaign showing our soldiers and the Iranian liberals working in tandem to bring freedom to the oppressed classes of Iran. Zoroastrians, Christians and women will all feature heavily in the messaging, with starry eyes thanking their American liberators. The coverage will even be mostly true for once, as we really fight on the side of the most tolerant and Western-aligned faction present."
USA_darwin_supply_hub_desc:0 "The biggest hurdle in supplying the Iranians has been that we've relied on Australian shipping for the last stretch of the journey. If we instead repurpose and expand our naval base at Darwin, intended for use in supplying allies and intervention forces in Indonesia, as well as defending Australasia proper, we can move the supplies the whole way on American keel, in larger and faster freighters. This should enable us to greatly expand the transported volume, albeit at a significant monetary cost."
USA_new_contracts_for_military_industral_complex_desc:0 "The promise of fresh contracts delivered the expected support from the large armaments firms. A group of them have promised that they will invest in any efforts we make to expand the supply pipeline to Iran, on the condition that it is structured in such a way as to give them a voice in the running of the products. In normal times this sort of collusion with private arms manufacturers might be seen as unethical, but the last twenty years have been anything but normal, and we have to be ready to work with all our allies to defeat fascism, whether they be countries or corporations. Let us begin the restructuring."
USA_the_beacon_of_hope_desc:0 "We have done everything we can for the Iranian liberals. As we ship off the last of our promised supplies and men, we can only hope that the sacrifices America has made to help the Iranian people rise the torch of liberty against the extremist tyrants surrounding the liberals on all side. One day, Iran will be a true democracy and close ally of our great republic, but if the liberals can win here and now, we will have progressed tremendously in pushing back the darkness of our age. Let the flame of freedom we have lit in the Iranian people forever serve as a beacon of hope to the oppressed all around the Middle East and the World!"

While the great American Depression is slowly ending, the American political scene sits in chaos. The government remains locked between the uneasy Republican-Democrats and the National Progressive Party, a failing union of America's progressives, socialists and authoritarians.

Byrd to the 1956 Presidency, the campaign was a failure, and only carried a few states. The 1960 elections didn't go much better with Richard Russell Jr. as their candidate. After the second fiasco in a row, many of the senators lost their seats to Democrats and others crossed the aisle a second time in only 5 years.\n\nThey figured they couldn't run only on a segregationst platform, with appeals only to white southern voters. Their whole tone of their politics was thought to be too "nice", voters didnt understand what the difference between the NPP and the Democrats were, so they voted democrat, to not waste their vote. Some stayed behind as NPP senators, and noticed the new young Governor in Alabama, George Wallace. He is the perfect candidate for the NPP: segregationist, harsh critic of the mainstream foreign policy and has that angry aura, which they lacked.

Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, successfully landed along with a team predominantly made up of former Luftwaffe pilots. Köllner, on live television broadcast globally, snapped a smart salute to the flag of the Reich with the earth visible in the backdrop, a photo which has spread across the globe, thanks in no small part to German propaganda. Jubilant celebrations began almost immediately across Germany.\n\nAlready, President Nixon has publicly vowed that the race shall continue and that NASA is already making preparations for a permanent human presence upon the moon, in the form of a lunar colony. The President's announcement was quickly followed by one from Japan, who stated that they will land on Mars.\n\nDespite the President's insistence that the race is not over, the American public has taken the news poorly. Although America managed to get the first astronaut into space, public confidence in the space program is at an all-time low, as fewer Americans than ever look to the night sky with a sense of explorative awe."

After his unanimous victory in the 1969 Chess Championship against Bent Larsen of Denmark, he has been considered by many observers as the greatest American grandmaster of all time, and has achieved the highest ELO rating in recorded history. But his brilliancy has not gone without controversy, and the chess community has descended into chaos after he has recently refused to defend his title against Germany.\n\nFollowing his perfect victory in the 1963 US Championship, Fischer has made multiple fascist and pro-German statements, becoming an official member of the extreme right of the National Progressive Party. He has openly described himself as a Yockey, and has made numerous racist statements towards the Japanese and has undergone virulent anti-semitic triades during tournaments, despite him being half-Jewish himself, a label which he passionately rejects. In this year's 1972 Chess Championship, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, he has verbally attacked both the United States and FIDE, culminating in him surrendering the chance for him to play against Klaus Darga of Germany, automatically awarding him the new world champion by default.\n\nHe has answered to the press's questioning with "I refuse to let my name be associated with that of Jewish deceit... I would rather be branded a traitor by you FIDE degenerates than to go against another intellectually superior Aryan of my own blood." It appears as if he will continue to stir discontent if we let him say what he wants to say. What should we do?"

However, upon arrival, he instead entered a government office where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich. After a short internment, the Führer announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and his decision to forfeit from the championship. The rumours of his half-Jewish ancestry seemed to have been overlooked by authorities. He has confirmed to the press that his emigration is permanent, citing recent actions to "silence" him by the American government.\n\nAlthough some are graceful that we will no longer have to deal with that little shit's mouth anymore, the game's community has mourned the loss of our finest player nevertheless. In the Reich, Fischer has been appointed a personal instructor for him to learn Deutsch, and already has current champion Klaus Darga gave him the go-ahead to play with him against the United States in 1975. With no hope in winning FIDE's next competition, this intellectual battlefield, however minor, has been conclusively lost to fascism.

All those foolish enough to wish to challenge him will now have to do so within our borders. Although there exists rumours that Fischer is half-Jewish himself, we have decided to believe his own claim that he descends from German blood only. In the meantime, Fischer has considered developing his own chess variant for our own people, "Überchess."

As the divides within the Republican-Democrat Party grow, debates turning to fights and friends turning to enemies, the truth only becomes clearer and clearer: the party as it stands cannot be saved. Yet there is still time to act. America must once again reckon with its issues of race, be it through words or war. We can only pray for less blood to be shed this time around, for the fate of the world rests upon this near-divided house."

The peaceful march quickly turned into a running battle in the streets between police and activists.\n\nThis event has been widely televised across the nation, with average Americans shocked by the police brutality on display in Birmingham.

Furthermore, there are reports that pro-civil rights activists, attempting to flock to Birmingham to continue the movement, have been driven out of the city by police and locals alike, with several would-be protesters returning home battered and bruised.\n\nWith the rising violence in Birmingham and elsewhere, Vice-President Kennedy has reportedly convinced President Nixon to consider federalising the Alabama National Guard and deploying it to restore order in the state."

Thinking quickly, she called the police, who in turn informed the FBI and arrested Greenberg this morning as he left for work.\n\nJoseph Greenberg was revealed to actually be Josef Hansen, an agent for the German Abwehr. Ironically disguised as a Jewish American, his mission was to secure a job at Bell Telephone, study their communications infrastructure, and identify flaws for the installation of wiretaps and other espionage methods. Even more concerning was that his phone book had the telephone number of several local NPP politicians inside, and it seemed he was trying to contact the party's fringe elements, including the fascist agitator Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nCharges for violation of the Espionage Act are already being brought against him, though he will likely end up simply being deported back to Germany, rather than facing a long prison term in the United States."

Their main source of ire is the rising tension of the civil rights movement in the South, and specifically the President's inability to properly contain it. The man who once staved off nuclear armageddon, or so we would claim, now seems powerless to stop a bunch of student protesters and racist hoodlums from squaring off, and his image is deteriorating as a result. And Nixon—who seems impish and anemic when compared to Vice President Kennedy's charm and charisma—needs all the positive press he can get.

He tore the end open and peeked inside, finding nothing more than a small bundle of papers and photographs. But when he saw what they were, his blood ran cold. Internal memos from the 1960 Progressive National Convention, transcripts of private conversations between NPP senators, schematics on wiretaps, photos taken inside NPP campaign headquarters, and most chillingly, a letter from Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman authorizing the espionage. At the bottom of the envelope was notecard with a message typed on it: "Unless you want this on the front page of the Post next week, contact me and we'll talk," with the address for a P.O. box printed on the other side.\n\nThe staffer had enough wits about him to immediately reseal the envelope, call the F.B.I., and pass it on to them. In under an hour, it was on J. Edgar Hoover's desk. A brief call to Nixon informed him that the staffer agreed to stay quiet, the bureau's top men were already set on tracking the blackmailer down, and it would all be over in a matter of days."

Surprisingly, the blackmailer showed up suspecting nothing, and was immediately nabbed by federal agents.\n\nThe blackmailer turned out to be a 24 year old NPP activist, one Charles B. Juno, but they have had little success getting more than that out of him. He has refused to say anything besides requests for a lawyer, but fingerprint evidence has left no doubt to him being the one who sent the envelope. The Bureau's best guess is that he's a misguided progressive who wanted to force through change with some underhanded methods, but that's all they've got to go on. Charges of espionage and mail fraud are already working their way through the pipeline, and he'll hopefully go to trial by November. With any luck (and a bit of nudging from the White House), it could get moved up to October or late September, meaning that he'll be safely behind bars when the midterm elections roll around."

The Secret Service immediately began investigating potential leads in the mail room, but to little success so far. The White House staff are all whispering about something that's going on, and most of them suspect that it's an information breach that involves the NPP in some way.\n\nEven worse are the rumors going about that another Grey Scare is on the horizon, but directed at any and all NPP members.

Hitler's health has been in a state of constant decline ever since the signing of the 1945 Armistice. There is now strong reason to believe he is no longer competent to lead Germany, as many of his duties have been delegated out to various ministers and aides.

Others think that it is bottom-up: they gain momentum among the common folk, and as they gain more publicity, the message bubbles upward and reaches those with actual political power and the ability to shape policy.\n\nBut whether it's top-down, bottom-up, or merely a case of great minds thinking alike (though the Republican-Democrats would consider it "fools seldom differ"), both National Progressive Party politicians and their constituents are calling for the beginning of impeachment procedures against President Nixon. If they begin, he would be the first President to be impeached since Andrew Johnson, nearly a century prior. But that is not what concerns Nixon. He is well aware that his rivals have little love for them, and the projected effects on his 1964 re-election bid are currently minimal.\n\nWhat he fears is not what the NPP is saying, but the fact that some of the R-Ds are starting to listen."

While the negotiations were indisputably legal, it nonetheless undermines Nixon's image as a devoted patriot who fights the evils of fascism across both oceans. The National Progressive Party has already started drafting advertisements mocking the deal in anticipation of the 1964 election, and the already hawkish public in California is eating them up. Despite California being his home state, Nixon's odds of electoral victory in November look to be more of an uphill battle than anticipated..."

Even the President has publicly praised the investigation, swearing up and down that it will exonerate him of the malicious and ill-founded rumors that have been haunting him for months.\n\nPrivately, however, it is another story. The moment he got to his private office in Room 180, he slammed the door behind him and vented to his staffers about how the investigation was a shame, a farce, a conspiracy to destroy everything he accomplished! No group was safe from his invective; the National Progressive Party, "dirty traitors" in the Republican-Democrats, the wiretappers for leaving so much evidence, J. Edgar Hoover for being sloppy in burying the evidence, alleged conspirators in the FBI and the White House, and everyone else who ever wronged him in his Presidential career.

Connally turned to the President, commenting that nobody could say all of Dallas didn't love him. "No," replied the President, flashing the Governor his winning smile, "you certainly can't." As he turned back to the crowd, he heard a sudden blast-\n\n-and his head blew apart, showering his wife with blood.\n\nAs the dust settled, two bodies were brought into the city morgue: the president's, and that of a young black man, shot dead by officer J.D.

Police investigating the courthouse found a Carcano rifle stashed in a fourth floor maintenance closet, and several shell casings were found by a window overlooking the stretch of road where the President was shot. A search of his apartment also revealed a motive: Henry was a fervent Guyanese nationalist, and he felt he had to stop American hegemony over his home nation at any cost.\n\nAs Speaker of the House and acting Vice President John McCormack prepares to take the oath of office, America is slowly coming to grips with this tragedy just after wrapping their heads around the reality of Nixon's resignation.

 USA.130.desc_cr_passed:0 "The National Progressive Party Convention concluded today with a rather surprising outcome. After multiple ballots, with candidates representing each of the many factions of the party over the whole spectrum of politics including Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson, a clear winner emerged: George Wallace.\n\nThe controversial Alabama Governor, with his well known and outspoken views on segregation and support for the Jim Crow laws of the Southern states, focused most of his primary campaign not on the debates about Civil Rights, but on the corruption of the current Republican-Democrat Administration and the increasing power of the federal government. He successfully torpedoed RFK's leadership bid by honing on the single fact that he was the former campaign manager for Nixon, and the brother and Chief of Staff of John F. Kennedy. So how did the corruption and rot go, and would it infect yet another Kennedy's Presidential ambitions? Enough delegates and the convention were convinced that it would, thus handing the nod to Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, the Governor spoke not simply as running as President for the South, but for all of America. "I intend to give the American people a clear choice. I welcome a fight between our philosophy and the corruption and heavy handedness of Washington, telling us what to do, what to think, which now threatens to engulf every man, woman, and child in the United States. I am in this race because I believe the American people have been pushed around long enough and that they, like you and I, are fed up with the continuing trend toward a corrupt Banana Republic which now subjects the individual to the dictates of an all-powerful central government."\n\nWallace has great support in the Southern states, and pockets of support in coservative enclaves who despise the increasing power of government in their lives, and millions more that just want to banish the corrupt and dirty politics of Nixon to the history book as fast as possible. It just remains to be seen if this can translate into victory in November."

After multiple ballots, with candidates representing each of the many factions of the party including George Wallace, Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson, a clear winner emerged: Robert Francis Kennedy.\n\nHow "Bobby" Kennedy, the brother and Chief of Staff of former President John F. Kennedy, and the seventh of nine children of former President Joseph P. Kennedy, and was President Nixon's campaign manager in 1960 and who took the nation at storm with an explosive speech criticizing the party of his father and brother for failing to live up to the people, became the standard bearer of the opposition party just four years later is still a shock that many are trying to come to terms with. Perhaps it was the sidelining of his brother as scandal engulfed the White House, or perhaps to simply make a clean break from the corruption of the current Administration and of his own past to serve his nation. The true answer may be that Robert was infuriated with the President's vetoing of the Civil Rights Act, stalling, if not ending the dream of equality for all races. This issue, which RFK has championed since he first got into politics, managed to obliterate his closest competitor, the segregationist Governor Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, Robert Kennedy made his support for Civil Rights adamant. "We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God command it, although they do; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do."\n\nAlready RFK has great support across the nation: from African-Americans seeking to end the terrors of Jim Crow, blue collar workers that see him as their strongest advocate, progressives wishing to make the US a more equal society, and millions more that just want to banish the corrupt and dirty politics of Nixon to the history book as fast as possible.

In 160 pages of detailed, emotionally-charged narrative, he accounts the lives and aftermath of six Hawaiian-American civilians who survived the atomic blast. The Japanese cruisers landed on their shores scarcely a week later, and forced them to stay on the islands, calmly telling them that if they want the charred corpses of their families to rest in peace, they will have to bury them themselves.  "The six of them all share one pain: they envy the dead," Hersey wrote.\n\nOver one million Americans, still reeling after the horror of the atom was revealed to them only two years prior, opened up their Saturday morning magazines, expecting comforting satire and laughter. But as they read its prose, all they felt was their hearts suffocating with sorrow and dread towards the nuclear holocaust Germany and Japan now ceaselessly march towards.\n\nIt is twenty years later, and America opens up another special edition of The New Yorker to find the same horror once again, now directed towards the crimes of our own nation. Sprawled across the first page is an aerial photograph of hundreds of mutilated corpses strewn out across a river flowing with blood, all positioned in the shape of a massive swastika. The perpetrators have been confirmed to be a U.S. Army company, who, deployed to search a village in the deep rainforest, were allegedly ambushed by a group of unidentified combatants while crossing the Orange River. Fueled by rage, the officers ordered for the bodies of the fallen to be rearranged into the symbol of hate.\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland's own attache conservatively estimates that the composition was made out of 347 stormtroopers that attempted to capture and torture the infantry division. Rejecting this, anti-war activist Tom Hayden's private correspondents assert that the photo was composed of 504 unarmed Boer settlers who happened to walk in the direction of the death squad's nightly patrol. We have yet to receive an official statement from any German authorities that isn't composed entirely of vague, slur-riddled insults.\n\nThe article begins with the suicide letter of Private First Class Varnado Simpson, who hanged himself from guilt on March 16th, hours after the massacre. The investigation eventually lead to the discovery of the war crime. "We formed the [swastika's] center with dead infants and exhumed animals," he wrote. "Lord, have mercy on their souls, not mine.""

 USA.174.desc:0 "News arrived from Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary today that three prisoners have escaped! They appear to have escaped during the night, as the three prisoners went into their cells the night before, and were absent from roll call the next morning. A brief survey of their cells found tunnels dug through the walls, and paper-mâché dolls in the prisoner's beds. A frantic search found no trace of the three prisoners on the island, and it was only when mainland police found a shoddy raft along with prison clothes that the it was realized that Alcatraz had been successfully escaped from. More worrying than the fact that multiple people escaped from an 'impenetrable' facility however, is the fact that two of the escapees are members of the German-American Bund, including Vice President and KKK member: Arthur Hornbui Bell.\n\nThis has, predictably, caused an incredible amount of outrage amongst the populace. Not only did a prison that was 'inescapable' broken out of, but a major member of the German-American Bund is now at large in the USA. All across the country, as bizarre and stupid as it may seem, people lock their doors at night and peek out their windows to see if Bell himself will come to their doors.\n\nThe Republicans have demanded that the police make the hunt for the fugitives the top priority, while Democrats say that such a move would only make the escaped rats hide even deeper, and that the police should not give this case any more priority than an average case. What should the course of action be?"

A helicopter flying overhead spotted a group of three men rushing to hide from its spotlight, and after the group was cornered aerially, a ground squad was able to arrest the three men and positively identify them as the escapees from Alcatraz.\n\nThe worried populace of California and the US as a whole are very relieved, as wild tales of the Alcatraz Three breaking into houses swept the nation, despite the fact that this. The President himself reportedly expressed joy upon the capture of the Three, and is expected to award those who devoted themselves to the search.\n\nAfter they were captured, the Alcatraz Three were interrogated on a variety of matters, including details of their escape, and in the case of Arthur Hornbui Bell, more questions about his membership in the German-American Bund. Bell has predictably remained quiet on those issues, but surprisingly ranted at length about the 'inhumane' conditions he was kept in at Alcatraz. The interrogators, who were FBI agents, were shocked to say the least at how bad the conditions were, at least according to Bell. Also mentioned deep into his rants about his conditions, were Bell's KKK ties and his plans to use them to help stay underground. Whether the KKK would've actually risked helping Bell and his comrades, some of the country's most wanted fugitives, is doubtful, but the fact remains that he thought that they would, which has caused renewed suspicion on the KKK.\n\nIn any case, at least for today, the American people can rest easy, for major fugitives have been caught, and the streets of the country, from sea to shining sea, are that much more safer."

Furthermore, after Alcatraz was successfully broken out of, an investigation ensued to see how the 'impenetrable' prison was penetrated from the inside. The report has revealed shockingly bad conditions, especially for people in the Bund such as Bell. Many across the country have called the prison 'inhumane' and 'almost Nazi-like in nature.' If the Alcatraz Three were recaptured, the report could've been stealthily released during the celebrations, which would've allowed us to avoid the large amount of outrage we currently face.\n\nPoliticians through accusations left and right about who is to blame for this, and it is clear that this escape will have political ramifications, especially in California where Alcatraz is located."

How could people not worry?\n\nNow that the Alcatraz Three have been caught however, the populace of California see that Pat Brown was correct, and that the strategy of not worrying about the fugitives paid off.

From this he believes there are two principles of justice that could be formulated:\n\n   1.  Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.\n\n   2.  Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.\n\nRawls is happy to finally have it published so he can go campaign for the upcoming senate election, where he hopes to gain the seat for the Center faction of NPP.\n\nSome party tops have already praised it for its commitment to social justice, especially its insistence on a global perspective, and some members have been bold and predicted the book to become a leading piece of theory for the growing party, as social justice is connected with systems of justice and injustice across the globe. People in Colorado are in a sense not free until people in Tokyo or Germania are free, free from systematic injustice.

[Root.GetLeader] finished, leading the room to fall silent.

 USA.162.d:0 "John Glenn figured his heart had never beaten so fast or so hard in his life, as the heavy staccato rhythm threatened to pop out of his chest. In 46 years of life, he had been blessed with many momentous occasions: flying his first combat mission over the Marshall Islands, careening towards the stars on Friendship 7, even quitting NASA after Nixon cut its funding. However, all of those life-changing events seemed trivial as a host of his countrymen stared in admiration as he slipped his hands off of that pristine little bible upon which he swore the oath of office. Now, millions keenly watched him standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial to hear his first words as President; words that would define the fate of his country and possibly all of mankind.\n\n"Today, we as a nation are brought together not to celebrate the victory of a man, but of a movement and an idea. We celebrate the idea that our homeland is indeed a great society; one unsullied by war, or autocracy, or depression. We celebrate and reaffirm our dedication to freedom, democracy, and the self-determination of all peoples. To make our celebrated ideals into appreciable ones, we must begin anew as a people, just as the world begins anew with the changing of the age and the passing of the generational torch..."\n"...This new page of human history has brought with it many innovations and yet more uncertainties. From these innovations have spawned both terrors and wonders, some of which with the potential to save mankind, and yet others with the capability to destroy it. To truly be a great and freedom-loving society, we must not appreciate those creations of man that implants a balance of terror upon the whole of the species; rather, we should celebrate and develop those creations which may yet bring us to the depths of the oceans, or the distant light of the stars."\n\nPresident Glenn stood slightly taller as tens of thousands of once-dreary, blank faces erupted into smiles and cheers and applause. Through one-hundred-and-forty-nine combat missions, three trips to space, two governorships of Ohio, and a presidential election, he had followed the tides and turns of his life and his country. Now, it seemed his solemn, God-given duty to let his country follow him. Ex nihilo..."

Aides, secretaries, and even a few senators, all sitting in pure silence as the low hum of the television and its tinny speakers recite the unfortunate news.

Our friend in Guyana has gone too far, we need to do something about it."\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, follows Haldeman's lead and speaks next, Nixon still bearing an angry yet contemplative look.

We can't top that, if only for moral reasons."\n\nSlowly the room evolves into conflicting arguments, various cabinet members arguing for an exile army, others for isolation. Suddenly, a voice cuts through the clamor. "That's enough!"\n\nThe head of the table has spoken. Richard Nixon stands, and then speaks, "I don't care about it either way, I just want the press and Burnham, both, to calm the hell down! Force him, pressure him, it doesn't matter.

Ball's in your court, Jack."\n\n"I'll make the call."\n\nKennedy makes the move to get up, but Nixon raises a hand. Turning around, he scans his eyes over the room, "Who says we have to do anything?"\n\nHaldeman raises an eyebrow, "Dick, he's executing people, we can't let this slide, not with the press on our backs like they are now."\n\n"Since when are we so high and mighty? We've supported men like Burnham in the past, and even if we ignore this, we still have plausible deniability."\n\n"I don't think this is a good idea," Kennedy says, placing a hand on Nixon's shoulder, "I think we owe it to the people of Guyana to help them."\n\nHaldeman looks over to McNamara, who shrugs, "Gotta tell you Bob, I agree with Dick on this one."\n\nHaldeman looks at Nixon, "Well Dick, you're the president.""

Four years ago I stood before you and vowed to never allow this silence again, and now you the people stand before me, and you are no longer silent...\n\n...but it is not sufficient for the nation to plaster over the gaps. The cracks must truly be healed, and the inequalities of the nation truly addressed before the spectre can finally be slain. Let us go forth in the interests of the land, and of the people. Let us work to once and for all end want and misery in this country. Let us strive to fulfil the true potential of this nation and allow all to enjoy its bounty. America shall be truly one and indivisible, and never again shall we allow an invisible and impoverished world exist right beneath our noses!"\n\nWild applause greeted his closing remarks. President Harrington smiled, but he knew that words alone could not move a nation. Four years had been spent doing precisely what he had warned against, his efforts a mere bandage over the wound of want. Now he had four more years, and he had to make them count. Poverty's grip over the other America had been weakened - now was the time to cut it loose forever."

In Washington D.C. over $15 million in property damage has been accounted for, but order has largely been restored. Baltimore, where citizen's anger may have burned the hottest, has concluded its extraordinary use of heavily armed federal troops.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out over President Nixon's use of the veto against civil rights legislation are slowly starting to die down, as a combination of apathy and repression slows their inertia. As the dust settles, historians and political scientists are examining the possibility that this outpouring of discontent marks the greatest social upheaval since the Civil War. Even as the violence on the street is decreasing rhetorical violence is increasing.\n\nMany Civil Rights moderates are outraged, but are afraid of being tied to the riots by future electoral opponents. A broader swath of opposition, from liberal Republicans to the NPP-Left, are decrying Nixon as the tyrant envisioned by the Founders. An open letter signed by a bevy of top academics castigated the Republican party for falling in with segregationists and cast the veto as the ugly vow of the unholy union between R and D. All signatories promised to leave the party and encourage others to do so as well. It's clear that the veto of the Civil Rights Act has hardened its proponents, and divided the country even further.

 USA.1803.desc:0 "In 1877, US Congressmen reached a compromise that resolved the disputed Presidential election of 1876 by giving the Presidency to Rutherford B. Hayes in return for ending Reconstruction and permitting the establishment of Jim Crow laws. Almost a century later, these laws stand unchanged across much of the South. Few thought the seventies would be a decade where the Allman Brothers Band were banned from performing in their home state, where the Negro Motorist Green Book would surpass 40 years of publication, and where men and women of separate races still face criminal prosecution for falling in love. Yet, thanks to decades of federal ambivalence to this injustice, and failure to pass a lasting Civil Rights Act, have allowed our nation's greatest shame to endure.\n\nBlack America's fury at their continued oppression has reached a boiling point. With Reverend King and his principles of nonviolent resistance being dead for almost a decade, many Blacks have turned to violence, organized or disorganized, as the only viable form of resistance. Segregated department stores hire armed guards to protect against vandalism, and Southern police have become increasingly militarized in order to quash the near-monthly riots in Black neighborhoods. In reaction, Southern Whites have been flocking to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist militias in order to brutalize Blacks who protest injustice. The Left-NPP declares themselves the only political force who truly fights for racial justice, Yockey claims to be the one man who can save White America from lawlessness, and many take their word for it.\n\nIf America does not make any progress on this crisis, it will only further deteriorate. We may just be forced to choose between the survival of segregation, or of our nation."

 USA.1901.desc:0 "Like all organised crime establishments the anonymous room in Queens had the smell of cash, and cigarettes, and too many secrets whispered into waiting drywall. The men within paced about and spoke at length on the subjects one would expect; a laundering here, a fiefdom issue there, the latest quotas from the bosses. Everybody knew enough to make sure they didn't leave the wrong words hanging in the air for the wrong ears: shibboleths sprouted in the smoky mist. The Genovese branch of the Mafia hadn't clung to their yellowed halls of power on the East Coast by playing stupid. They certainly weren't going to start now.\n\nThe struggle at present wasn't one of power, but of its old friend, money. The New York joints had been busted up for a long while, and for a time the patrons had settled for what they could get. Depression years and the chaos of the Fifties had a way of killing any uptown pretensions. But now that America was recovering the old middle-class patrons were beginning to filter out, and ones even the Cosa Nostra deemed distasteful were moving in to take their place. The pimps were losing control of the situation on home turf. Something had to be done.\n\nAntony, Joe and Mark (not their real names) fiddled with the map of South Avenue on the table. A new joint, free of the putrid smell of the Old Town, would jazz up the revenues and act as a movement point for money, guns, information. Old trades, new venue, easy money. But who would frequent it? It wasn't exactly Broadway.\n\nAntony smiled. His next words would change history, even if he didn't actually know it yet."

Left and left and right and left again, a swirl of the body so sweeping it belongs on the parade square, not the rough tiles of the inn floor. Then the shoes opposite him trace the contours in lithe slips and end up in their original placing (by some arcane coincidence).\n\nMartin glares at him with visible annoyance. John looks down in sheepishness. The moment stretches taut, pulls apart and snaps. Martin bursts out laughing, tickled by something on John's face, and pulls him to himself. His face smells of smoke and aftershave.\n\nThe kiss is tart and startling in the dim neon. John pulls back with the old instincts of the Brooklyn boy who always knew how much of himself to show, and how much to hide. But today a part of him resists, and instead he stays. It's a raw comfort, and in the glittering sharpness of the moment it's all he has.\n\nMartin pulls away with some reluctance. The date has been brief, and even this hour has been snatched at great cost. They haven't much time. He takes John's arm and together they spin out of the little bar, their little dance studio. Their figures are quickly lost in the chaos and brilliance of the New York night, blending in neon-shaded phantoms before disappearing."

 USA.1903.desc:0 "It's a quiet night in the Stonewall Inn. Barely anyone notices my scribbling notes in the corner; this corner of America is obscure, but it shares the tendency for aching introspection, abbreviated loneliness hammered out via cheap glass cups. Beyond the occasional whisper and the wordless glances, not much makes it out of the haze of anonymity, and long may it remain so - the haze is the only thing that separates this part of town from the moralizing glaze of the rest of America. It's the only thing that keeps it safe.\n\nAs I'm writing this, a pair of young men (in their twenties, perhaps?), one Latino, one Caucasian, are swerving to the aching beat of "Satisfaction". Their patterned shoes tap out a rhythm at once familiar and strange; just irregular enough to inject vitality while keeping pace with the beat. Their bodies trace patterns so bold they'd be scandalous anywhere else, but here in the trace of lips and hands on waists it achieves careworn familiarity, like an elderly seamstress fixing an old cardigan. If this had been a different country perhaps they would have become dancers. But the lipstick and the gaudy dresses they wear would kill their careers, and a lot more besides, in this one. America is home to the brave, but this land isn't free, not for some. Not yet.\n\nFor now there is the freedom of the swirl and curve of dance, the celebration of the joy of life in a world with so little else. Another man offers his hand, and I rise to dance. In the gentle rhythm and the smoky swirls I sense some vast and gentle ecstasy, and with every sway I come closer to its source."
 USA.1903.a:0 "Life thrives in the strangest of places."

 USA.1904.t:0 "The Warning"
 USA.1904.desc:0 "The Stonewall Inn is a spot of light and loud laughter in a world slipping into autumn. The sounds of occasional retching aside, the Inn is a good place, and the crowds know it to be far more than just a building. For many of its patrons it's the only place they can truly be themselves. But autumn is sweeping in, one chill breeze at a time.\n\nThe signs have been there for a long while; the Mayor's riding on the coattails of the Moral Cleanup movement sweeping the country, and the officers sent to do the collection duties (one calls it the offering bag, with only a hint of irony) from the Inn tell the bartenders of the Anti-Mafia Team they're forming in the back of the Metropolitan Department. It's not like the community they've formed here hasn't known the wrath of the cops, but this time it'll be different. Change is coming to America, as the President says over the airwaves, but some changes are less welcome than others.\n\nThe bartender methodically cleans his cups half an hour before closing time: he'll take care of the mess in the toilets afterwards (and there is always a mess in the toilets). He got hired by the Don same as all the staff, but he's come to love the place. The patrons are gaudy and have a glint in their eyes, but it's a real life they're living here in the damp spaces.\n\nHe looks at a sleeping customer hunched over his cups and smiles wanly. Whatever happens next, he'll stay with the ship, even if the hull's leaking. His passengers deserve nothing less."

The four undercover officers curse as they fiddle with the switches, and the lights flicker back to life. The few who realise what is about to happen begin pushing their way through the crowd, but the Morals Squad have already locked down the window exits and are marching through the doors, flashlights in hand, as they bust the biggest gay establishment in New York.\n\nThe raid doesn't meet with a receptive crowd, to say the least: As officers lead those in women's clothing to the toilets many resist. It's common knowledge that those who get arrested by the Morals Squad as cross-dressing men don't make it out without bruises, spit-drenched faces, manhandling. Men with faces lean and caked with makeup wrestle with their cuffs and spit on their captors. None of the bar's patrons have made it this far in a world which mostly despises them without getting a little rough around the edges, and when the Man pushes them around they push right back.\n\nBy the time the raid concludes about 150 people are under arrest. But more are gathering in the late-night darkness of the Big Apple, and a storm is brewing that cannot be contained."

 USA.1906.t:0 "We Shall Overcome"
 USA.1906.desc:0 "The greatest LGBT riot in the history of the United States begins with a logistics problem. The Morals Police have grabbed 28 cases of beer and 19 kegs of hard liquor, but with the patrol vans occupied elsewhere they have nowhere to put it. Instead they keep the patrons on lockdown as the wagons arrive, far too slowly for a police operation. The patrons, of course, are understandably upset, and those few not under arrest quickly join the growing crowds gathered outside the building. Many of them know that once the Inn dies, so too does the living, breathing heart of gay culture in the Greatest City in the World. They have everything to lose.\n\nAs Mafia members and patrons are loaded onto the wagons, many still struggling, a lone voice breaks out. 'We Shall Overcome', a protest song written for the South African War, finds receptive ears in another angry crowd facing another unwinnable fight. Growing cheers, growling, shouts of "Gay Power!" echo from the crowds, which have swelled to bursting in the street. Stormé Delarverie falls to the floor struggling against four officers, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nRecords are unclear what exactly happens next: in a wave of anger, the mob pushes over police wagons, hurls bricks at the officers retreating into Stonewall, presses garbage against the broken windows. Many of the most repressed members of the gay community lead the riot - the drag queens and the street boys, leading a wild, wild charge. Sylvia Rivera, notable drag queen, will remember it as "the greatest night of her life". The doors of the Inn are broken open with a battering ram. Officers inside prepare for a fiery last stand.\n\nAnd then the police trucks arrive."

 USA.1907.desc:0 "The initial reaction is one of rage. Officers bloody and coated with garbage, an inn wrecked with violence - and the fairies did it. The fairies. Violence explodes on the streets as police officers take the law into their own hands, and hammer their rage onto the defenceless. The mob arrayed against them is far too far gone to care. They form the rough outline of a cabaret chorus line and begin to sing. Their voices are piercing in the late night, and the police have had enough of being needled - they rush the line.\n\nMen and women get hammered with nightsticks as bedlam spreads to the surrounding streets. Crowds run around police officers, laughing gaily like warriors in the light of burning cars. By the time the riots come to a halt, Christopher Street is blocked, half the cars on it are overturned and every garbage can for a mile around has been emptied into the street. Witnesses describe an odd beauty to the refuse-strewn street, like a river of broken toys.\n\nOf course, the streets aren't the only thing breaking the news: all through the next day crowds gawk at the burnt-out shell of Stonewall, and when the next night comes the they are joined by songwriters, poets, activists and tourists washing down the streets in a tide of exuberant energy. Allen Ginsberg notes, on the way back, that "the guys there were so beautiful-they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago.""

Though we could not stage direct attacks in the Home Islands nor in China, we have pinpointed various locations where we can start breaking down the Sphere from within. Let's begin with a nation that many of our great-grandfathers are familiar with.\n\nThe Philippines. These islands were the spoils of our victory over the Spanish Empire in 1898, and they stayed with us until the Second World War saw them forcefully ripped away from our influence. The Japanese preyed on the inhabitants ever since, spawning dozens of pro-democratic rebel groups that we could lend aid to. Their close proximity to the Japanese island may prove to be useful if we can get the Filipinos on our side.\n\nVietnam. The Vietnamese have been oppressed since the dawn of French colonialism, and the handing over of Vietnam to Japan only made matters worse for the natives. This could be our opportunity to introduce democracy and let Vietnam be ruled by Vietnamese for the first time in centuries. Vietnam could also be a gateway to India or even China itself if we succeed.\n\nIndonesia. These islands provide a large bulk of the Sphere's resources, mainly oil, rubber, and a hefty worker population. If we operate in Indonesia and persuade them to rebel against their Japanese overlords, the economy of the Sphere would suffer incredible damage. There would be shortages across East Asia, and it may cause other members of the Sphere to renounce their membership, further pressuring the Empire of Japan."

Both Goldwater and Glenn sought to replace the current President, either by going to the right and appeal to the Democratic wing of the party in the case of Goldwater, or further to the left and the Republicans for Glenn. However, neither managed to get many delegates in the few primaries that were held for the R-Ds, and just as soon as they announced their candidacies, they were forgotten and left on the sidelines.\n\n But now the President can focus on their eventual opponent in the NPP, and [USA.GetLeader] is secretly hoping that they can win a second term just as easily as he pushed out "AuH20" and "Glenn Rogers" from the nomination."

There are now only two viable candidates in a race that has seen many trying to win the keys to the White House: Arizona Senator and proud firebrand conservative Barry Goldwater, or Ohio Governor and famed astronaut John Glenn.\n\n For months, in debates on TV and radio, at rally's from coast to coast, and in living rooms and over the dinner tables of everyday Americans, the battle between Barry and John has raged. Pins with their faces, and slogans like "IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT" and "SOAR TO NEW HEIGHTS WITH GLENN", posters, newspaper ads, cardboard hats and all the memorabilia of a campaign seeking to win the chance to be the R-D standard bearer. Both are claiming that only they can end the anomaly that is the National Progressive Party's [USA.GetLeader] who now sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the first non Republican or Democrat to hold the highest office in the land since before the US Civil War over 100 years ago. But before they can focus on the NPP, they have to get the nod at the convention.\n\n But as the night drags on and ballot after ballot shows little movement between Goldwater and Glenn, finally one of the few "favorite sons" left on the ballot, only there because some delegates hoped against hope that their chosen candidate could serve as a compromise candidate, finally folded.

After four years in the White House, it's time for another Presidential election so the whole country can determine if the incumbent deserves another term, or if it's time for a change.\n\n The Primaries for the R-Ds was short and sweet this year, as only one candidate emerged to challenge the President, South Dakota Senator George McGovern. However, like usual in American politics, it's next to impossible to beat an incumbent president in the convention, and McGovern's long-shot attempt quickly fell flat, turning the R-D Convention into a coronation for [USA.GetLeader]. Promising another term of prosperity and success, the President focused his sights on the National Progressive Party, readying his party to take them on."

This year, the fight has boiled down to a two horse race, between former Secretary of Defence and Ford Motor Company Executive Robert McNamara, and South Dakota Senator George McGovern.\n\n McNamara, who's only government post was as Secretary of Defense, but seeks to bring "business efficiency" to governing, represents the more mainstream opinion of the R-D party as a moderate Democrat, while McGovern is a staunchly liberal Republican, who's unofficial slogan of "Acid, Amnesty, Abortion" has become divisive across the nation, and is posing a major question for the delegates at the convention. McGovern claims that he can take some of the votes of the NPP's Center wing, forging a new coalition that can expand America's progressive future, while McNamara's supporters are claiming that McGovern would destroy the R-D party, and hand another victory to the National Porgressive Party.\n\n However, questions between both options abound. Is McGovern too far left wing to hold the R-Ds together? Is McNamara's business experience a boon or a hindrance? Many Republican-Democrats are expressing dismay that these are the only viable options they have this time, and raising concerns of a lack of support and a fracturing of party unity.

Bennett and Michael Harrington walk stiffly towards each other, offering each other thin smiles and a wooden handshake. The two are hardly friendly; Harrington has been a vocal critic of Bennett's international policy since day one of the administration, singling out Bennett's preferential trade policies with the OFN as a betrayal of American labor. \n\nAs the debate moves into the topic of foreign affairs, Harrington wastes no time going on the attack. "Mr. President, I'm often approached by people on the street - good, hardworking, honest Americans - asking whether they'll have a job next year. These are miners, steelworkers, farmers - the beating heart of American industry. How can you claim to be keeping America strong, when your administration subsidizes the purchase of foreign goods, leaving Americans grasping for pennies?" \n\nBennett smiles neutrally back at Harrington. "The beautiful thing about trade, Mr. Harrington, is that everyone benefits. You say that American industry is being weakened; I say that it's roaring to ever-greater heights, as tariffs come down across the OFN. You say that America is weakened by our purchases from our allies; would you prefer that we squeeze our allies dry, like the Nazis and their puppets? America can never stand alone in this world, and certainly not while facing the likes of the Germans and the Japanese.""

The focus of the debate would be domestic policy - an area that Harrington, ever the academic, had written about at length. But the devil was in the details, and Bennett was nothing if not a master of the details. \n\nBennett made a show of holding up Harrington's domestic policy platform - a veritable tome. "I admire your passion, Mr. Harrington. The crusade for the common man." He smiled. "But have you actually considered what it means to implement this? These programs, promising to bring the federal government into every facet of American life - you'd be talking about doubling, tripling the federal budget. Can you convince Americans why the federal government must bear all the burdens carried by our states and our communities"  \n\nHarrington wasn't lacking for a response. "Mr. President, it's easy to say that things can't be done. But the reality is, beyond the walls of this auditorium, I have seen another America, one that suffers for want of food, dignity, and security. And this is before we factor in the struggles faced by our African-American communities! How can we claim to be the mightiest, the wealthiest nation on Earth, if we cannot feed our poor and shelter our homeless? The question is not whether we can or cannot; it isn't even a question. We have a duty to the American people, and we must try to make things right.""

In earlier times, the two had been cordial acquaintances in the Senate, united by love of country despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle. But there would be no quarter today, with the Presidency up for grabs. \n\nSmith wasted no time shifting on the attack. "President Bennett, you speak of brotherhood between the peoples of the free world through freer trade within the OFN. Though the OFN must remain united against oppression, I question the wisdom of your approach; your policy confuses leadership with foolhardiness, charging ahead while turning a deaf ear to American workers and industry. The Treaty Ports should remind us all of the costs of ignoring American interests for naive hopes - of appeasement thirty years ago, or of fraternal brotherhood today." \n\n"Senator Smith, we distinguish ourselves from Japan and Germany by our promise that America stands for a free, prosperous world. The OFN is a community of peoples: it is not a vehicle for totalitarian domination, or colonial dependency. Free trade is the surest means by which freedom survives, binding peoples together in free and open exchange." President Bennett stared Smith down.

The argument would not, could not, be won on its merits, but Bennett and Smith were nothing if not resourceful, and more than willing to take a few cheap shots. \n\n"President Bennett, you promised the American people stability after the tumult of Richard Nixon's impeachment." Smith smiled, before plunging her dagger home. "But a President is elected to lead, not to manage. The American people dream of moving confidently into the new decade, of reuniting with the Treaty Ports, not of smoke-filled rooms and committee minutiae. Nothing great was ever achieved by an abundance of caution." \n\nPresident Bennett's neutral expression hid his biting response. "Senator, if I have observed anything in my years in government, it is that the National Progressive Party has many dreams and many faces, to the point I have trouble hearing who speaks for the party as a whole. You accuse me of boring consistency in my commitment to maintaining the fabric of our Republic; I say that the American people prefer evolution to revolution, especially if the revolutionaries can hardly agree on what to have for breakfast, let alone their vision for the nation.""

 USA_debate.3.desc:0 "President Lyndon B. Johnson and Michael Harrington, who otherwise shared much in common on their prescription for the ills of American society, cut a sharp contrast from the moment they stepped on stage. A smiling Johnson towered over Michael Harrington as he vigorously manhandled Harrington's arm before the cameras. Harrington, to his credit, refused to budge or flinch, a quiet force radiating against Johnson's energetic presence. \n\nTheir roles reversed as the debate kicked off, with Harrington launching into a surprising criticism of Johnson's administration. "President Johnson, your Great Society suffers from a lack of ambition. The root causes of grinding poverty, of unemployment, of the debasement of human dignity remain unaddressed. We both agree on the role of government in fundamentally bettering American lives, yet you focus on treating symptoms while ignoring the cure that millions hope to receive." \n\n"Well, Mr. Harrington, you certainly don't lack for conviction." President Johnson replied. "But when you speak of dreams, I deliver results. Ask any American on the street: are they safer, healthier, more satisfied with their life? We both agree that politics is about people; but results matter as much, if not more than, ideas in politics. And I can promise you, if you believe that the Great Society isn't ambitious enough, you ain't seen nothing yet.""

 USA_debate.29.desc:0 "President Johnson and Michael Harrington eyed each warily, looking for an angle of attack. There was surprisingly little traction to be had on issues of policy: pundits had noted that Johnson's Great Society and Harrington's answers for the Other America had a great deal in common. The debate would be decided on the question of trust, of suitability for the nation's highest office. \n\nPresident Johnson cleared his throat. "Mr. Harrington, while I must respect your compassion, I have my questions about the company you keep. The American people wonder how the NPP will govern in practice, instead of in theory, especially when you've got the likes of Gus Hall shouting about nationalization and class warfare. There is plenty to work on in America, but shouting Bukharinist nonsense isn't how you go about it." \n\nHarrington's face twisted in indignation. "Is that how low you'll go? Judging an entire party of your fellow Americans by the most radical among us? I will be unequivocally clear: Mr. Hall's views are at the extreme fringe of the party, I do not endorse them, and the party's leadership does not endorse them. We stand for an inclusive America, a caring America, an America where a man doesn't need to fear the boot of the blackshirt or the commissar, but instead trust in the charity of their fellow man. It is beneath you, Mr. President, to fall back on fear instead of civil virtue.""

Johnson and Senator Margaret Chase Smith, once colleagues in the Republican party in the brief years before the formation of the R-Ds, wore stony smiles as they approached each other on the stage. The fallout of Smith's abandonment of the Republicans still rankled: for Johnson, Smith was a constant annoyance, while Smith resented Johnson for putting power over principles. \n\nSmith wasted no time going on the attack. "President Johnson, you speak highly of your Great Society, about alleviating poverty and want. But my constituents see an economy stuck in neutral, while the demands of the taxman grow year after year. You may have good intentions, President Johnson, but redistribution without prosperity is simply stagnation." \n\n"Senator Smith, you and I both know the result when business is allowed to pursue profits over people."

"But it's easy to talk about nuclear annihilation, to casually threaten Armageddon as a solution for America's woes. America will not vote for a suicide pact with Japan under your watch." \n\n"I hardly think your party's one to lecture Americans about expansive military commitments, given your party's record on South Africa." Smith glared at Johnson. "In the defense of freedom, America must remember that the clearest enemy is the enemy closest to home - the enemy that still occupies American soil in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Hawaii. I do not seek war, but the rapacious Japanese have shown they do not understand anything other than the threat of force to open negotiations.""

That is an affront; the matter of civil rights cannot be done piecemeal and confined to individual localities; every man must be free, or nobody is free at all." \n\n"You paint me as a radical for wanting to respect the traditions of our democracy, while you demand obsequience and threaten submission for the slightest dissent. Is it not altogether more radical to refuse to accept that differences of opinion must at least be heard in your march to progress?" Goldwater shook his head.

Glenn opened. "But the elderly, the poor, the pensioners, the veterans who fought for America's freedom in the last war. Their disappointment is palpable, when I talk with them; that in President Kennedy's world, some suffering is more worthy than others of redress." \n\nPresident Kennedy leaned into his podium. "Nothing could be further from the truth! The history of America is the history of how African-Americans, and the worker, have labored for far too long without any avenue to address their deprivation. I resent the accusation that our government should ignore the plight of the most deprived in the name of incrementalism, for justice delayed is justice denied.""

Kennedy smiled, but without a hint of warmth in his eyes. "But the American people today look for solutions for their problems here on Earth: poverty, discrimination, education. We seek a more perfect union here at home, rather than escape it in the stars." \n\nGlenn bristled at Kennedy's comments. "I assure you, President Kennedy, that our platform is far more than just a return to space. But if you insist on questioning the value of America's space program, I can point to every schoolchild who came up to me in the years following Gemini, asking if they too can bring America to the stars.

"President Wallace, your 'right to work' programs are an abomination against hard and honest work. You would turn the act of labor into a thankless rat race, rather than the means of human dignity. Americans should work to live, and not live to work: It's callous, it's dehumanizing, and wholly un-American." \n\n"Well, Governor, we'll just have to agree to disagree on the value of work," Wallace drawled, an icy smile on his face. "But I'd have to argue that instead of talking about ideals, you should judge a man by their results. A growing economy, surging business, the spread of American products to foreign markets. America is thriving, Governor, and I'd hate to live in a world where success is defined as failure.""

Marshall, a graduate of Howard Law School and an experienced civil rights litigator, would be the first African-American to serve on the highest court in the land. His appointment would surely mark a turning point in American history. However, some in Congress are not so willing to see such a point turn in the first place.\n\nMany Senators come from the South, and are directly reliant on white voter blocs who aren't well-disposed towards putting a black man on the Supreme Court. Several members of the Senate have already put out statements to the press expressing their firm opposition, although nobody has come out and said that it would be due to Marshall's race. Instead, the releases mentioned the dangers of "liberal judicial activism", and other such phrases. Clearly, the appointment of Thurgood Marshall will be a political fight for the ages."

 USA_sen_bill.105_pass:0 "A man who once declared that "You do what you think is right and let the law catch up," will now sit on the most important judicial institution in the United States. In a decisive vote in the Senate today, Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as the newest Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court. Justice Marshall will be the first African-American to serve on the court, and his confirmation is undoubtedly a victory for the Civil Rights Movement, which he himself has worked tirelessly to advance.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, a number of conservative senators railed against "judicial activism", and made a variety of statements that many commentators have called little better than dog whistles. Some even asked whether or not Marshall had ties to "American Bolsheviks". This strategy failed, however. At a press conference today, Justice Marshall stated his gratitude to the Senate, and to the people of America, before posing for pictures with his two sons and his wife, the civil rights activist Cecilia Suyat Marshall.\n\nThis is a truly historic moment for the nation, representing the triumph of justice over institutional racism!"

Two weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to have Marshall's nomination proceed to the Senate floor, but with the recommendation that it be rejected. This was seen by many as a death knell for the appointment, but still, our whips persisted in trying to gather the necessary votes. They failed. In a tight vote, the Senate rejected Marshall's nomination, led by a large bloc of reactionary southerners.\n\nAs observers sat stunned by the rejection of the man who would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, some in the White House were already drafting plans for a response. The next name on the shortlist is the fairly conservative Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Let's hope that he makes it."

#Leaders

 POLITICS_RFK_DESC:0 "Robert Francis Kennedy certainly didn't grow up in an impoverished family. Part of the Kennedy dynasty of businessmen and politicians, his childhood was a not one of hungry stomachs. Growing up in suburban Massachusetts of nine children in a profoundly American family, he was raised in the context of their Irish and Catholic heritage. Living through the Great Depression most of his child, with being born in 1925, he witnessed impoverishment never seen before.\n\nFollowing his child at Catholic schools across New England, Kennedy decided to serve in the navy after the tragic death of his brother Joseph Kennedy in 1943. Serving in the Atlantic and especially the Caribbean, Kennedy became familiar with serving his country. Historians cite his relatively short service in the navy as a massive influence on his life and his decision to enter politics.\n\nFollowing an honorable discharge, RFK entered journalism school, particularly interested in welfare and social programs designed to help the unfortunate. He was at the peace conference between the United States and Japan, and after the war visited Sweden to write about their extensive welfare programs. With his brother John F. Kennedy as the running mate to Richard Nixon, Robert provided significant support, with John beginning to rely on him, saying that "If I need something done and done quick, I go to my brother."\n\nJFK was assassinated soon after. Robert, depressed with his beloved brother's death, was driven further down with the veto of the Civil Rights. RFK, disillusioned with partisan politics, decided to join the National Progressive Party, determined to make America a true land of the free and a land of the American dream for everyone, considered a run for the presidency. In 1964 he sweeped the elections under an ideal of social and economic liberties, but most importantly, an American idealism seen in few others, an idealism in an ideal-less world."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "In many ways Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to by his initials LBJ, is living proof that the American dream still lives. Born in a Texas farmhouse and raised in humble conditions, far from the glitz and glamour that America's elite grew up in, Johnson has not forgotten the lessons of his modest upbringing. Though he spent several years teaching impoverished children in texas he quickly found his calling in politics. With a natural talent for aggressive persuasion and deal making that would soon be widely known in Washington as the "Johnson Treatment" he began first as a congressional aid before quickly ascending to the House of Representatives, then the Senate where he reigned as majority leader of the Republican and then Republican-Democrat party for a decade. Now he has finally climbed as high as any American can, and has been elected the President of the United States. LBJ has promised to heal the wounds that have been festering in America for decades, and is determined to tackle the issues of racial and economic inequality once and for all. Johnson envisions an American society where every man has equal rights and equal opportunity to succeed. However, with Germany descending further into chaos by the day, and Japan fighting to maintain and expand its sphere, Johnson may not be able to focus exclusively  on the home front, as events beyond his control threaten to pull America back onto the global battlefield once more."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "리처드 밀하우스 닉슨은 복잡한 인물입니다. 원래 미국 하원의원이었으며 나중에 캘리포니아주 상원의원이 된 닉슨은 숙련된 정치공작을 통해 빠르게 의회 내 중요한 인물로 등극하였습니다. 상원의원 시절 닉슨은 조지프 매카시와 함께 회색분자로 정부 내 파시스트 의혹자들을 뿌리뽑기 위해 긴밀히 협력하였습니다. 또한 매카시만큼 주목을 받지는 않았지만 닉슨도 여전히 반파시스트적 감정을 가지고 있다는 것은 누구도 부인하지 않습니다.\n\n평생 공화당 의원이었던 닉슨은 민주당원과 함께 일하는 것이 썩 편하지 않았습니다. 하지만 국민진보당의 폭넓은 지지로 그는 재선에 나가야만 했고 1960년 대선에서 연합한 당으로 승리한 그는 대통령직이 생지옥이 되었습니다. 부통령인 존 F. 케네디가 자신의 사기적인 카리스마와 놀라운 역량으로 닉슨으로부터 스포트라이트를 빼앗아 가며 닉슨 행정부에 쐐기를 박았습니다.\n\n불안한 독일국과 일본과의 외교정책에 집중하고 싶었으나 민권 문제는 더 이상 무시할 수 없는 주제가 되었습니다. 자국 내에서는 인종 간 긴장이 고조되고 있으며, 사람들은 행동을 요구하고 있습니다. 닉슨은 인종 통합과 분리 어느 한 쪽에 지지하기를 꺼려했지만 이런 갈팡지팡 행보는 점점 어려워지고 있습니다.\n\n물론 닉슨은 국민진보당을 저지하기 위해 할 수 있는 모든 일을 다 할 수 있고, 그 중에서는... 초법적인 수단도 있습니다. 백악관 내를 포함한 사방에서 도전자들이 몰려오는 상황에서, 닉슨은 국가라는 배를 안정적으로 유지하기 위해 애쓰는 지옥같은 시간을 보낼 것입니다."
 POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "John Fitzgerald Kennedy's path to political prominence was one overshadowed by others' controversies. Scion of the powerful Kennedy family and son of President Joseph Kennedy, John found himself recalled from the Pacific front after his elder brother Joseph Jr.'s death, and had been groomed to follow in his father's steps ever since. In the years following the 1948 election and the implosion of the Democratic Party, the Kennedys (with the exception of John's brother Robert) loyally followed the shattered remnants of the party to the GOP, becoming members of the Republican-Democrat Party. Some predicted that John's career would be tainted by the failures of Kennedy the Elder's administration, but John's personal charisma and political savvy were enough to help him grow out of his father's shadow. In 1960, he was on the Republican-Democrats' victorious Vice Presidential ticket. Unfortunately, his running mate was Richard Nixon.\n\nNow, John finds himself thrust into leadership of a nation in turmoil, one that desperately looks toward him for guidance. But for every American who sees him as a beacon of stability, there is one who sees him as an obstacle: ardent segregationists fear that his idealism will lead to him furthering civil rights legislation, and committed progressives scorn him for not being as impassioned as his brother Robert. Fate has ordained John F. Kennedy be the one to steer the ship of state, but will he be the one to guide it out of dangerous waters?"
 POLITICS_GEORGE_WALLACE_DESC:0 "George C. Wallace portrays himself a both an honorable Southern gentleman and a true red-blooded American, being the only one willing to protect his proud country from the Japanazi menace while preserving the rights and liberties his people hold dear. In reality, his is an opportunist par excellence, willing to mold his ideology as he sees fit in order to maximize the possible turnout at the polls. Seeking to court the fine white voters as governor in his native Alabama, this inevitably manifested itself as a staunch segregationist platform, defending it on all fronts form what he claimed were un-American fifth columnists who sought to undermine states' rights. As the Democratic Party imploded in 1948 and the "Solid South's" party loyalty wavered, Wallace eagerly jumped ship to Richard Russell Jr.'s fledgling States' Rights Party, then to the Patriotic Party, then finally to the National Progressive Party.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Wallace successfully moderated his position just enough to win the support of the NPP's Frankensteinian voter base, and eventually the majority of the nation. Now that he finally sits in the White House, his alliance of convenience with many of the NPP's more left-leaning members is rapidly wearing thin-how do you hold together a party bounded only by hatred of the establishment if you are the establishment? But Wallace likely doesn't plan for the alliance to last much longer. Rather, it seems that he is going to use all his time and effort to legally buttress segregation as much as he can. When it is effectively impossible to dislodge, he will return home, where he shall be forever immortalized as the savior of the South."
 POLITICS_MARGARET_CHASE_SMITH_DESC:0 "Margaret Chase Smith has been making history her entire life. The first woman to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The first woman to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first woman to stand for the Presidency - and win. Every step of the way, her detractors have whispered that she would be a shrinking violet, unfit to serve - and President Smith delights in proving them wrong every time, having built a reputation as a hard-nosed and principled defense hawk over her two decades in Washington.\n\nTo her few allies, President Smith is a pillar of consistency in a fractious NPP; to her many rivals and enemies, President Smith is an infuriating iconoclast. She stunned her Republican Senate colleagues by being the first among them to break ranks and denounce Joseph McCarthy's Grey Scare as 'un-American' for its attack on civil liberties, even as Tokyo labeled her a 'beast in the shape of a woman' for commenting that she would have nuked Japan back after the atomic attack on Pearl Harbor. After abandoning the R-D's after their merger in 1951 (refusing, she said to work with the architects of America's surrender) Smith has had an uneasy relationship with the rest of the NPP, utterly refusing to break bread with the NPP-Right's segregationists while chastising NPP-Center or former Republican colleagues if they seemed to be losing focus on the fascist threat.\n\nSmith is convinced that America must take the fight to - and defeat - the fascists, without selling its soul in the process. And now that the NPP has rallied behind her - if only to capitalize on the cowardice of the R-Ds while putting the segregationists to the side - President Smith faces the even more daunting task of convincing the rest of America that the fight against foreign tyranny is never done, while consigning the worst impulses of the NPP to the dustbin. It is her greatest challenge yet - but for President Smith, it's only Tuesday."

 POLITICS_JOHN_MCCORMACK_DESC:0 "For most presidents, their inauguration is the culmination of years of political ambition and success, bringing them to the highest office in the land and a chance to ultimately shape the nation to their ideals.\n\nFormer Speaker of the House John McCormack was not granted that luxury. Rushed out of Congress and into the White House on a day of panic and blood, he is faced with a nation in turmoil. Outrage over President Nixon's actions on civil rights has shattered any semblance of political decorum in Congress, with constant shouting matches taking more time than legislation. The people have made their voice heard as well, with riots and protests breaking out weekly and voters changing their registration to support the radicals of the National Progressive Party.\n\nMcCormack has isolated himself in the White House, only speaking to trusted aides and friends on the matters affecting the nation and leaving his deputies to calm the turbulent waters America is headed for. Facing a party in crisis, the divisive issue of segregation, and the rapidly escalating war in South Africa, the reluctant president's next days in office will change the nation's direction for years to come."

 POLITICS_CURTIS_LEMAY_DESC:0 "If someone had told Curtis LeMay in 1962 that he'd be president in the next few years, he'd have laughed in their face and called them a damned fool. And yet, despite never seeking the office, LeMay finds himself in the Oval Office on the heels of George Wallace's disastrous presidency.\n\nNotorious for his comments on the 1964 campaign trail about "bombing Africa back to the Stone Age", the former Air Force general was considered a political liability by many members of Wallace's campaign for his gruff and apolitical nature. Never a true politician, LeMay's main role in the administration has been to address defense concerns, especially involving America's nuclear capabilities. Now, with the departure of Wallace, he must finally take a position on the issue of segregation. Surrounded by potential enemies and tasked with healing the troubled nation, clear skies for LeMay will be short in the coming days.\n\nStill, President LeMay has taken these events in remarkable stride. As the storm rages around him, he is confident that America will make it through this latest crisis. In 1943, he saw the greatest defeat in American history, riding out the storm at the controls of a heavy bomber, and now sees a chance for someone to finally take decisive action and heal the nation. Going forward, the president is absolutely certain of one thing: The United States will not fall into further turmoil on Curtis LeMay's watch. It wouldn't dare."

USA_sen_bill_name_6:0 "The Federal Student Aid Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "Education has been a local issue since the beginning of America, with local school districts maintaining schools and the states providing some direction. However, this has meant that there are wide disparities based on wealth and state mandates, meaning that many students are not receiving the full education they need for the future. The Federal Student Aid Act will fix this, by providing resources to states and districts that desperately need it, and a baseline standard of education across the US."
bill_6_passed:0 "President Robert Kennedy, surrounded by the students and teachers at Strong John Thomson Elementary School in Washington DC just a few blocks from the White House, is signing the Federal Student Aid Act to applause as news cameras and photographers record the event for posterity.\n\n "Today, we say that all of America's students deserve the chance to learn and grow, to become the well-informed, smart and intelligent adults of tomorrow that will make America better than ever. The doctors, teachers, artists, inventors and leaders of tomorrow are in our schools today, and we must do all we can today, to make tomorrow even better."\n\n The FSA Act will set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government will provide money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the new standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\n While education groups and civil rights organizations are really pleased with the FSA in their equality and standardization edicts, many state's rights proponents are angry at the law, which is pretty much stripping the local control over education that has long been one of the most important roles of the states. While most of the articles of the law are only for those school districts that require the funds and are "opt-in," the need for money in many of the poorest states will force them to compromise on their beliefs in order to get the money they need to operate. Nevertheless, the FSA will soon make America one of the best educated nations in the world."
bill_6_failed:0 "In a shocking announcement, the Federal Student Aid Act has failed to clear the Senate. Overseeing the vote, Vice President Hubert Humphrey has announced that the act has failed to acquire enough votes, leading to a major blow to his and President Kennedy's effort at school reform.\n\n "The failure of this effort to reform America's schools will reverberate throughout the years," Bobby Kennedy angrily thundered during a press conference. "The next George Washington Carver will never get the chance to see their full potential. The next Ernest Hemmingway will be stuck in poverty. The next Thomas Edison will never get to change the world."\n\n The FSA Act would have set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government would have provided money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the now tabled law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\n While state's rights supporters cheer the failure of the "draconian" and "tyrannical" efforts to level the playing field for education across America, Civil Rights groups and education unions decry the failure of the law and the many inequalities that will persist for the indefinite future."

RD_R_compromise_desc_6:0 "Senator Scoop Jackson has been meeting with multiple Republican senators throughout the sprawling Senate Office Buildings, most of them individually in the attempt to get enough votes to pass the Federal Student Aid Act.\n\n In fact, Scoop has been surprised about how receptive to the idea of additional education funding is with his colleagues from the other side of the aisle. After all, there is nothing more popular with a politician seeking re-election than to point to a new school in their district, or the improved test scores, to show that, yes, they are doing their job.\n\n But, like usual, there are some concerns with the law as it has been written. For one thing, some Senators have expressed concern about how the federal mandates will strip the states of their prerogatives to manage education, which would be incredibly unpopular in some states, especially in the south and west. Other senators were a bit uneasy on the cost of the FSA, which will tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to the budget. While, again, they like the idea of supporting education, they also don't want to saddle those same children with even more debt when they become taxpayers.\n\n Having taken their words into account, Scoop has approached the committee writing the bill, and made his suggestion:"

USA_sen_bill_name_7:0 "The Affordable Housing Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "The American dream is centered around one thing: owning your own home. But since the end of the war, real-estate developers have been more focused on developing middle-class suburbia: thousands of cookie-cutter homes on twisting cul-de-sacs far from the centers of the big cities. This has left millions, especially racial minorities, squeezed out of the housing market. The Affordable Housing Act will solve this issue, and build many new homes and the amenities to make new communities."
bill_7_passed:0 "As the signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office to the flash of photographers' light bulbs, an assortment of real estate developers, civil rights leaders and mayors from cities big and small across America applauded as President Robert Kennedy signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.\n\n "I'm pleased to sign this bill into law, which will make it easier to build affordable, liveable, and safe housing for those Americans that could only dream before of home ownership," the President said moments before he signed the law. "Today, we say that every family in the United States has the right to own their own home."\n\n The new law will allow cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill will also provide subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and help establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city. These new homes would not be apartment blocks like some opponents had suggested, but duplexes, townhouses, row houses and other such buildings to allow more people access to housing that the larger, car focused suburban dwellings that are too expensive, or even forbidden, for racial minorities to access: government funding is only provided on the condition that no barriers will be put in place for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or anyone else.\n\n Already, there are many plans being drawn up for the "Kennedyburgs" in every city in the nation, redeveloping areas that had overlooked and abandoned for years, promising a new construction boom that will last for a decade or more."
bill_7_failed:0 "The votes are in, and the Senate has rejected the Affordable Housing Act, one of the key planks of President Robert Kennedy's agenda. Complaints about the cost, the dictates on how the money would be spent, and even lingering segregationist elements in Congress scuttled the law that would have revitalized major cities, opening up housing development for minorities and working class families, and created a whole new chorot of property owners.\n\n "The President is disappointed at the Senate's rejection of the Affordable Housing Act," a spokesman for the White House said in a press conference. "Nevertheless, the fight to expand home ownership and give all Americans, not just the wealthy and middle class, the chance to buy their own house will go on."\n\n The defeated law would have allowed cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill would have also provided subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and helped to establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city.

RD_R_compromise_desc_7:0 "Going to the Senate cafeteria and seeing the various senators dining is an eye opening experience. Men and women who are diametrically opposed ideologically can be seen chatting and having a good time, while those that are of the same party often can be seen avoiding each other. It's a great way to see who is an introvert, who's an extrovert, and even how the nitty-gritty details of politics can get done.\n\n In the haze of cigarette smoke and the smell of the meals served hot by some of the best chefs in Washington, "Scoop" Jackson was sitting with some of his Republican colleagues, enjoying their mid-afternoon break.\n\n "So, about the housing bill," one of the Republican Senators said, cutting into a chicken breast. "I can tell that you are here to get that passed, right?"\n\n "Well, if you want to get to business," the Senate Leader of the C-NPP replied. "But you know it will help your communities greatly, make a lot of new homeowners, taxpayers, and all that shit that will make your cities and states happy indeed. And it won't be just Chicago or Seattle or Miami that gets the money. Every city and town in the country can apply for it."\n\n "It's going to cost a lot though," another senator said. "Not sure if my constituents will appreciate having to foot the bill."\n\n "It will pay for itself in time," Jackson replied, as he took a drink of water. "Besides, if you give a man a home, go and cut the ribbon when they open it up, I'm sure lots of folks will support you in your next term." Jackson set his glass on his tray, and stood up, preparing to hand off his dirty dishes and return to work. "You can't get better publicity than that.""

USA_sen_bill_desc_9_minimum_wage:0 "For far too long, industry, business and capital have dictated the terms to their workers: how long they will work, what they will be paid, and what benefits they will receive, and if they will recognize unions or not. While there has been advancement in the past century to make working conditions safer and increased wages, many companies do their best to undermine all these promises. The National Labor Relations Act will fix that: unions are officially recognized and will be supported by the government, a eight hour work day for all industries will be codified, and a national minimum wage will be established."

bill_9_passed_minimum_wage:0 "In one of the biggest changes to American economics in the 20th century, President Bobby Kennedy has signed the sweeping National Labor Relations Act into law. Overnight, the balance of power in the largest economy in the world was shifted, with workers and employees granted unalienable and legal rights that would further balance their position vis à vis their employers.\n\n One of the NLRA's largest components include the recognition of trade unions, banning employers from firing workers or trying to intimidate and halt anyone who tries to organize any work places, with steep penalties and fines for any company found to have broken this law. Regulations mandating that full-time workers be given an eight hour work day, or at least generous overtime pay is another large component of the NLRA. Penalties will be put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as "part-time", a "contractor" or "freelance", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects is the establishment of a federal minimum wage: $1.50 for full-time employees in most industries, with agriculture and a handful of service industries allowed to set a slightly smaller minimum wage to a minimum of $1.10. But this minimum wage would be re-evaluated every year based on inflation, to maintain the purchasing power.\n\n "The only way to maintain a strong economy and a strong democracy is to give everyone in the nation the ability to make a living," President Kennedy said as he signed the law. "To make enough to put food on their table and a roof over the head, to enjoy the fruits of their labor with leisure, and to maintain their dignity and freedom, never to be undermined by the greed and short-sightedness of their bosses."\n\n While opposition from business groups, conservatives, anti-unionists, and free market proponents has been intense, and Wall Street has seen a sharp drop in it's value when the bill passed, the NLRA has proven to be popular with the majority of the American workers and voters.

USA_sen_bill_name_15:0 "Power to the States Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_15:0 "Education has long been the purview of the states and local governments, with no federal oversight or control except for some funding. But in the past decades, the Federal government has attempted to force the states to accept top-down dictates on how and what to teach. The Power to the States Bill will prevent this. It's the individual state's job to determine what and how they teach, and we will get out of their way to do it."
bill_15_passed:0 "President Margaret Chase Smith today has signed the "Power to the States" Act into federal law, having passed through Congress last night after a midnight vote. The President addressed reporters in a press briefing after signing the law, stating that "...it is not the job of the federal government to mandate a one-size-fits-all approach to education in the fifty states of the nation. Each state, county and city knows what is best for them."\n\n This law curtails the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would effectively allow various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.\n\n The controversial law is a victory for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. However, opposition has been pronounced from civil rights activists as backsliding, and also from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states. But the law has passed, and a new normal for teaching will soon come to America."

This would have effectively allowed various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South. But this effort to turn back the clock on civil rights has failed.\n\n The defeat of controversial law is a major blow for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. The opposition from civil rights activists, and from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states, was enough to convince a majority of senators to not go ahead.

"Ladies, gentlemen," he began. "I'm sure many of you have questions our mission to implement the Federal Poverty Act. Many of you will wonder if there is a plan, some kind of template for our work." \n\n "I will be honest. There is no template, no plan, no prior precedent."

Who could have imagined that President Smith, up until yesterday so confident in the prospects of the most ambitious social project of the 20th Century, would now be delivering a halting address to the nation about her failure to overcome the opposition? \n\nThe government had even begun posting applications for new positions in the federal bureaucracy, and Sally (as many others) had dropped everything for the promise of doing good for their fellow Americans.

USA_sen_bill_name_17:0 "National Welfare Act""
USA_sen_bill_desc_17:0 "Progressive and conservative elements of the National Progressive Party have always disagreed over the implementation of welfare programs. The Far-Right wing of the party, in particular, has been outspoken against welfare. Now, due to the poor nature of the South, whence much of the Far-Right draws its support, a compromise is possible. With Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP working together, the new National Welfare Act would allow economic opportunity to millions of Americans, particularly in the South."
bill_17_passed:0 "After being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the National Welfare Act was passed in the Senate today and is soon to be signed into law by President Margaret Chase Smith. Winning an easy majority from both the National Progressive Party and the Republican-Democrats, it appears to have had a much broader base of support than was initially thought. Most happy at the news were the bill's main proponents: Senator Michael Harrington and Governor George Wallace, who came to a compromise on their differing views on welfare to create something that worked for both parties.\n\nAs soon as it is signed into law, millions of poor Americans -many of them from the poverty-stricken, rural South- will now be able to apply for government financial assistance. The bill's success has shown much of America that the National Progressive Party is truly capable of working together as a united political group on more than just foreign policy. It has also greatly strengthened the position of President Margaret Chase Smith, who stands to see a great uptick in her approval ratings."
bill_17_failed:0 "After a period of being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the results are in: the National Welfare Act died in the Senate. There was no dramatic filibuster from the Republican Democrats, nor a surprising change of allegiances that swept the vote; rather, there simply was not enough political support behind the bill. Senator Michael Harrington, who was one of the bill's main supporters, called the result "unfortunate".\n\nThe bill was heavily anticipated as the first instance of true cooperation in the National Progressive Party over welfare programs. Vocally supported by Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP, it found good ground in the House and quickly made its way to the Senate. Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace. While they will likely recover their reputations, it seems unlikely that welfare legislation will be passing through Congress anytime soon."

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act seeks to address that issue.  ESEA will provide substantially more funding to public schools, but the Act goes far beyond that.  It also expands after-school programs, makes free breakfasts and lunches widely accessible and free of potential stigma, and, perhaps most radically, gives subsidies and tax breaks to poor parents who can verify their childrens' public school attendance.  This suite of policies would improve grades, attendance, mental health, and basic childhood nutrition for millions of American children, in urban and rural areas alike."

USA_sen_bill_desc_21:0 "American healthcare is, like so many other things in this country, a massive enterprise.  It's also an unequal one.  Our hospitals are the envy of the world, yes, but millions of Americans don't have adequate insurance, if they have it at all.  This burden falls especially hard on the poor and elderly.  The Federal Healthcare Regulations Act will set minimum standards for all private insurers, requiring that they cover a variety of out-of-pocket expenses, non-hospital fees, and primary care, in contrast to the hospital-based business models we've seen before.  HMOs may protest, and healthcare-providing business owners may balk, but it's a small price to pay for a healthier, more secure society."

It produces our teachers, our doctors, our future leaders, and countless varieties of tradespeople.  It's also not exactly cheap.  The Higher Education Act seeks to fix that.  It lowers costs for public colleges and universities that receive federal money, and provides additional subsidies to expand the student body.  This will make it easier for poor and working-class students to get ahead in life.  Of course, it's encountering opposition from dyed-in-the-wool conservatives and ostensibly progressive liberals alike, who claim that it will upend the order of things.  To which the Harrington administration might respond, "It's about time.""
USA_sen_bill_name_26:0 "Affirmative Action Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_26:0 "One of the largest factors in the continuation of America's racial inequities has been lack of access.  This can include access to employment, to promotion, to higher education, and so forth.  Such a lack of access keeps families locked in a permanent cycle of poverty, keeping them from building wealth and improving their personal lot in life.  And such a lack of access almost always falls on American minorities.   \n\nThe Harrington administration is proposing the Affirmative Action Act, a plan to address these inequities directly.  It will establish new hiring guidelines for federal contractors, give preferential support to minority-owned businesses, and implement quota systems to ensure that public colleges give more opportunities to the underserved.  The GAO has estimated that such a plan, if implemented, would raise millions of peoples' incomes over the next twenty years.  In addition, their report finds that the AAA has the potential to drastically improve standards of living in numerous communities across the country, and would measurably reduce the racial wealth gap."

That's the case for millions of Americans, who are driven to bankruptcy, or just can't afford insurance in the first place.  The Medical Care Act, or Medicare, would change that.  It would create a government insurance program that citizens could voluntarily sign up for, if they met certain income criteria.  Such a program would cover any and all prescription, primary care, and hospital needs.  Medicare could serve as the foundation for a truly universal American healthcare system.  But the potential costs, paid through income taxes, have raised more than a few eyebrows in Middle America."

Conceptualized before the start of the Second World War, Right to Work Laws safeguard the right for employees to not have to become a part of a Labor Union associated with their trade. Though it looks fair for the worker by allowing employers to not demand such requirements from their employees, there have been a great deal of issues stemming from them; namely, many employees have taken to taking in the benefits that the Labor Union provides for the company's employees without paying any of the sacrifices as the Union member employees do. This is an unfair and unjust practice, and Right to Work Laws have continuously allowed for loopholes within a variety of blue-collar trades that cannot continue any longer."

USA_sen_bill_desc_42:0 "Elderly and disabled Americans are some of the most disadvantaged individuals in the population, with more than 40% living below the poverty line. As such, one of President John Glenn's most espoused campaign promises was to introduce legislation that would allocate a semi-livable income and healthcare coverage to all Americans over the age of 65, or suffering from a disability that prevents them from working. Based off of a bill proposed by the administration of Kennedy Sr., this 'Social Security Act' would allow Americans to allocate a percentage of their income into a special fund over the course of their working years. When they reach retirement, they may collect from the fund and have a steady stream of money flowing back into their pockets.\n\nWhile some conservative members of Congress have expressed absolute opposition to such a costly proposal, many more appear amiable or neutral to the bill. Consequently, both the President and the progressives in Washington anticipate being able to pass at least some of their desired reforms."

President John Glenn is therefore asking for Congress to pass the Augmented Defense Act, to provide new money to fund cutting edge technology to ensure American arms in the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force will be superior well into the future. This will also see funding for upgrades and improvements to military bases in the US and around the world, with better housing for soldiers, and improvements in training.

USA_sen_bill.101.d:0 "It was a bill that many senators knew would bring much-needed equality to the United States, a nation who had strived for the concept since the Declaration of Independence was signed. Historically, African Americans had little help from the government in their fight for freedom; even the Fifteenth Amendment only gave blacks the right to vote on paper. There was no way of enforcing the policy, and over time, Southern states exploited loopholes in order to maintain the status quo of the land: poll taxes, literacy tests, the infamous "Grandfather clause". All of this would change when the senators voted in favor of passing this bill. Desegregationists rejoiced, Southern politicians foamed at the mouth. \n\nThis act sternly outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Unequal voting requirements were abolished; schools, businesses, and other public accommodations were officially desegregated. African Americans essentially gained the right to go to any school, work for any business, and attend any public facility they choose. As a whole, African Americans had political power that the race had never seen before, and this was only the first step towards full desegregation. \n\nBut not all was well in the South. Immediately, Southern voters flocked to Strom Thurmond's Far-Right NPP in hopes that the bill would be reversed, that society would return to normal. Many Southerners despised this blatant attack on their livelihood, and with support from Southern politicians, they had the power to physically defeat desegregation. Not only did the bill grant much-needed reform, but it also caused division in the U.S. not seen since the Civil War."

Due to this success, the vast majority of the American public are either pleased with or don't care about the war. However, there is a small group discontent with America's involvement as a whole, but they are basically inconsequential."

### Foriegn tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Bombing_Airfields:0 "Our best planes are ready to take control of the skies over Sudwestafrika. We're going to bomb enemy airfields in the Sudwest to oblivion to ensure that our troops won't be harassed by any German planes.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Desert_Training:0 "The Namibian deserts are harsh, hot, and hostile for our troops stationed in South Africa. We must prepare them for the landscape so that we can force the Sudwest out of the war early.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Zentral_Liberville_NI:0 "Libreville is a valuable city within the Afrikan realm, providing essential supplies to enemy troops. We need to focus our energy into an attack on this city; if we take Libreville, we damage the Zentral, and we take important resources away from the Reich's grasp.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Ost_AgtOrng:0 "The rough terrain of Ostafrika renders a land invasion nearly impossible. Luckily, we have the Rainbow Pesticides on our side. The use of these substances would clear out all the impassable foliage and make an invasion of Ostafrika much easier for our soldiers.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Rock_and_Roll_Mother_Fucker:0 "The jungles of Ostafrika provide a natural citadel for the stationed German troops. If we are to defeat the enemy, we must train our guys in jungle warfare. We need to be able to move swiftly through the trees and hit the Germans where they least expect it.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_SAF_Buying_Out_Guns:0 "Our allies in South Africa are always in need of more guns, rifles, whatever we have. Seeing as they are our allies in this war, it is imperative that we keep their soldiers supplied. We don't want a supply issue to hinder us from winning this war, so let's ship more weapons their way.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_Buying_Up_Everything:0 "Not only do the South Africans need guns, but they also need artillery and support equipment. Shipping over some of these materials would give our ally a strategic advantage. We need all the help we can get from South Africa if we want to win this war.\n"
USA_Send_One_Advisor:0 "We may not be as involved in this war as South Africa and her enemies, but we can always increase the number of advisors we send over. Though it may cause some backlash, our logistics and battle plans would be improved, and we could invest more resources to ensure a victory over the Germans.\n"
USA_Send_Two_Advisors:0 "This war is becoming increasingly important every day that we are over here. We need to expand our logistics capabilities even more, we need to bring more troops to join the fight no matter how much hate we get back home.\n"


### Domestic Tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_Cranking_Up_Draft_tt:0 "The number of soldiers we are currently fielding is not nearly enough to win us the war. In order to bring more soldiers into the fold, we have to institute a draft. Many citizens back at home will certainly condemn us for this decision, but we must accept this consequence if we want to continue the fight."
USA_SAF_WAR_Cancelled_The_Draft_tt:0 "Our folks in the States are livid in their response to the draft. Protests are being held everywhere in our country, and we are starting to regret this decision. We must find a way to reverse the draft, no matter the cost, if we want to regain support for our government.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_No_More_Excuses_tt:0 "Ever since this war began, the practice of draft dodging has been widespread. In general, our young men are finding ways to avoid the draft. From this point forward, there will be no exceptions regarding who can be drafted. The more men we send over, the quicker this war will be over.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_reverse_the_exemptions_tt:0 "Our recently-drafted men are now resorting to even more drastic measures to ensure they can go back home. They are really bringing the morale of our whole army down; we must send them back, even if we have to lose some potential soldiers. Maybe the public will forgive this mishap.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_domestic_prop_tt:0 "Ever since the South African War began, people were holding anti-government protests. We need to activate the propaganda machine and cool the discontent that strangles our country. If we can convince the public that we can win this war, we will have one less domestic issue to worry about.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_take_out_troops_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been fighting for a while now, and we believe that giving a few battalions a trip home could work to our advantage. We may get some good publicity if we can bring some soldiers back home with smiles. This action would have a marginal effect on our remaining troops, but it would certainly give a little boost to war support.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_New_training_Shit_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been using up a lot of effort against the enemy. Not only does this produce a lack of ammo and supplies, but we also lose valued men when we put so much on the line. It's time to tone down the troops. We may lose some combat efficiency, but we will save human lives.\n"
USA_SAF_Talk_down_involvement_tt:0 "Support for this war is dwindling, and it's about time we put something in the papers. We have the option to reassure the public that we are not as involved in this war as the South Africans are. This will make our folks at home happy, but it could negatively impact South African troops and dampen their morale.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_bring_back_our_guns_tt:0 "This war is just not going in our favor, but we don't want to lose everything we have here. We must buy back the guns we loaned to our South African allies. This action would diminish whatever hopes our allies have left, but it would show the American public that we intend on ending the war soon."

#USA.saf.effects.5.desc:0 "It was a dusty morning in the bushveld the day doom came from the sky.\n\nDistant horns sounded from behind the clouds, and it was the din of the Seventh Seal being broken, and the Boers looked skyward and exalted, for they were simple folk, dirt-farmers one and all, and recognised the signs of Judgment Day. They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal things came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and fire rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from their bodies. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any ancient warmaster or khan. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. He made a signal and the helicopters left back through the smoke, blasting their music as they left the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten." #duplicate loc key

USA_debate.1.t:0 "Debate with Michael Harrington!"
USA_debate.1.desc:0 "Under the glare of the television cameras, President Wallace F. Bennett and Michael Harrington walk stiffly towards each other, offering each other thin smiles and a wooden handshake. The two are hardly friendly; Harrington has been a vocal critic of Bennett's international policy since day one of the administration, singling out Bennett's preferential trade policies with the OFN as a betrayal of American labor. \n\nAs the debate moves into the topic of foreign affairs, Harrington wastes no time going on the attack. "Mr. President, I'm often approached by people on the street - good, hardworking, honest Americans - asking whether they'll have a job next year. These are miners, steelworkers, farmers - the beating heart of American industry. How can you claim to be keeping America strong, when your administration subsidizes the purchase of foreign goods, leaving Americans grasping for pennies?" \n\nBennett smiles neutrally back at Harrington. "The beautiful thing about trade, Mr. Harrington, is that everyone benefits. You say that American industry is being weakened; I say that it's roaring to ever-greater heights, as tariffs come down across the OFN. You say that America is weakened by our purchases from our allies; would you prefer that we squeeze our allies dry, like the Nazis and their puppets? America can never stand alone in this world, and certainly not while facing the likes of the Germans and the Japanese."

USA_debate.2.desc:0 "President Wallace F. Bennett and Senator Margaret Chase Smith walked briskly towards each other, shaking hands briefly before turning to their podiums. In earlier times, the two had been cordial acquaintances in the Senate, united by love of country despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle. But there would be no quarter today, with the Presidency up for grabs. \n\nSmith wasted no time shifting on the attack. "President Bennett, you speak of brotherhood between the peoples of the free world through freer trade within the OFN. Though the OFN must remain united against oppression, I question the wisdom of your approach; your policy confuses leadership with foolhardiness, charging ahead while turning a deaf ear to American workers and industry. The Treaty Ports should remind us all of the costs of ignoring American interests for naive hopes - of appeasement thirty years ago, or of fraternal brotherhood today." \n\n"Senator Smith, we distinguish ourselves from Japan and Germany by our promise that America stands for a free, prosperous world. The OFN is a community of peoples: it is not a vehicle for totalitarian domination, or colonial dependency. Free trade is the surest means by which freedom survives, binding peoples together in free and open exchange." President Bennett stared Smith down. "We must prosper together, or we shall perish alone."

USA_debate.3.desc:0 "President Johnson and Michael Harrington eyed each warily, looking for an angle of attack. There was surprisingly little traction to be had on issues of policy: pundits had noted that Johnson's Great Society and Harrington's answers for the Other America had a great deal in common. The debate would be decided on the question of trust, of suitability for the nation's highest office. \n\nPresident Johnson cleared his throat. "Mr. Harrington, while I must respect your compassion, I have my questions about the company you keep. The American people wonder how the NPP will govern in practice, instead of in theory, especially when you've got the likes of Gus Hall shouting about nationalization and class warfare. There is plenty to work on in America, but shouting Bukharinist nonsense isn't how you go about it." \n\nHarrington's face twisted in indignation. "Is that how low you'll go? Judging an entire party of your fellow Americans by the most radical among us? I will be unequivocally clear: Mr. Hall's views are at the extreme fringe of the party, I do not endorse them, and the party's leadership does not endorse them. We stand for an inclusive America, a caring America, an America where a man doesn't need to fear the boot of the blackshirt or the commissar, but instead trust in the charity of their fellow man. It is beneath you, Mr. President, to fall back on fear instead of civil virtue."

Johnson and Senator Margaret Chase Smith, once colleagues in the Republican party in the brief years before the formation of the R-Ds, wore stony smiles as they approached each other on the stage. The fallout of Smith's abandonment of the Republicans still rankled: for Johnson, Smith was a constant annoyance, while Smith resented Johnson for putting power over principles. \n\nSmith wasted no time going on the attack. "President Johnson, you speak highly of your Great Society, about alleviating poverty and want. But my constituents see an economy stuck in neutral, while the demands of the taxman grow year after year. You may have good intentions, President Johnson, but redistribution without prosperity is simply stagnation." \n\n"Senator Smith, you and I both know the result when business is allowed to pursue profits over people." President Johnson replied acidly. "I don't think anyone's eager to go back to a time when soup kitchens were the only relief for millions of Americans."

Kennedy hardly smiled as they approached each other, exchanging a wooden handshake before turning promptly towards their respective podiums. The compassionate gentleman of the C-NPP and the doctrinaire conservative of the R-D's had hardly seen eye-to-eye during their years in Washington, and they weren't about to start now. \n\n"President Kennedy, it is my patriotic duty to remind you that the Treasury is not a bottomless well for your bleeding heart!" Goldwater criticized harshly. "The American people have a right to know, and to question, the use of their hard-earned money and the growth of the national debt, and they are saying: 'An American is entitled to the sweat of his brow!'" \n\nKennedy threw Goldwater a disdainful glare. "Senator Goldwater, try walking up to the unemployed veteran, or the mother struggling with the burden of caring for their four children, and tell them that all they're entitled to is the sweat of their own brow. As if they deserve their poverty. These people don't need slogans; they need our help!"

Too perfect; the two seasoned politicians were too practiced to do something so crass as to let their disdain for each other show in public. \n\n"President Wallace has let far too many of America's sons die in foreign lands in pursuit of - what, exactly?" Goldwater questioned. "Fascists must be resisted, but your support for maximum force in South Africa, the carpet bombings and bombardments that raze whole cities to weed out a battalion! It borders on the bloodthirsty, throwing American lives away for political gain." \n\n"Senator Goldwater, am I the only here who remembers your... enthusiasm for tactical nuclear weapons? That with one bomb, you could do the work of an entire division and save their lives to boot?" Wallace bristled. "War is hell, and we can't pretend it isn't. You say that war can be made easy with a single bomb; I assume you, Senator, that you would put America on the road to Armageddon in the name of victory."

USA_debate.7.desc:0 "Governor John Glenn and President Robert F. Kennedy were all smiles before the cameras, shaking each others' hands warmly before turning to their podiums. The unlikely astronaut leader of the R-D's and the patrician-turned-prodigal son of the NPP faced each other on the stage, sharpening their verbal knives to draw blood from the slight differences in their dreams of a brighter future. \n\n"Governor Glenn, your reputation as America's first astronaut precedes you in politics." Kennedy smiled, but without a hint of warmth in his eyes. "But the American people today look for solutions for their problems here on Earth: poverty, discrimination, education. We seek a more perfect union here at home, rather than escape it in the stars." \n\nGlenn bristled at Kennedy's comments. "I assure you, President Kennedy, that our platform is far more than just a return to space. But if you insist on questioning the value of America's space program, I can point to every schoolchild who came up to me in the years following Gemini, asking if they too can bring America to the stars. To ask themselves, to dream, of the promise of America and its potential. And dreams motivate us far more than despair."

USA_debate.8.desc:0 "Governor John Glenn and President George Wallace walked slowly, almost reluctantly, towards each other, seeming to only touch palms briefly before turning to their podiums. Wallace's segregationism had viscerally angered nearly everybody in the North, a sentiment shared by Glenn. Wallace, for his part, barely hid a sneer at the latest Northern carpetbagger looking to tread on his beloved South. \n\nThe debate, predictably, centered on the question of civil rights, and Glenn did not hold back. "President Wallace, I can't understand why you insist on segregation in the 20th Century. By what right do you seek to deny good, honest Americans their rights?" \n\n"Governor, I'm not surprised by your utopian dreams, having gone to space and back," Wallace replied acidly. "Come back to Earth, Governor: we are a union of states, and my constituents demand that their rights be respected." \n\n"Whose rights? President Wallace, I'll make this simple: do you stand by what you said three years ago?" Glenn snapped. \n\nA second passed, an eternity onstage. Wallace's eyes widened for a brief instant, then narrowed, hardened. "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever? Yes, I do."

Kennedy's assassination and the chaos of President Thurmond, prayed for the triumph of reason and calm as Governor John Glenn and Michael Harrington took to the stage. To their great comfort, the two politicians were more than content to let their oratory take center stage - but words could cut as deep as any sword. \n\n"Mr. Harrington, we're both men who look at America as it ought to be, trusting that this country is - and must - march towards a brighter future." Glenn said. "I admire that, but can you say that your party shares your vision? With respect to the late Robert Kennedy, Americans have seen the NPP spend the past few months arguing endlessly with itself over his legacy, with the policies of the Thurmond administration buffeting your party like a toy boat in a storm. How can you convince the American people that your party shares your vision?" \n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington responded. "The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, is a travesty that must be addressed. The National Progressive Party has come behind me, to grapple with and put to rest the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives. We are called to minister to people on Earth, Governor, not abandon them for the stars.""

Glenn said. "I admire that, but does your party share your vision? Over the past few months, the American people bore witness to the very real fractures in your party, at war with itself over the impeachment of George Wallace. How can you claim that the NPP can lead American into the next decade, after four years of bitter division?" \n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington responded. "I stand for those Americans who suffer, through no fault of their own, from racial discrimination, from poverty, and from hunger. The National Progressive Party has come behind me, to address the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives.

To their great comfort, the leading lights of conservatism and socialism in America were more comfortable settling their differences with oratory, rather than violence - but words could cut as deep as any sword. \n\n"Mr. Harrington, I will admit that I admire your humanity, your passion for the downtrodden and the disadvantaged." Goldwater stated emphatically. "But no man is an island, especially in politics. And I cannot help but wonder: how many stand with you in your own party? These past months have laid bare the agonizing disagreements within your party over the legacy of Bobby Kennedy. How can one lead when one's own house is in disarray?" \n\n"Senator, the American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington deftly countered. "Let me ask you a question, Senator Goldwater: how many must suffer for lack of food or shelter in your America of fiscal austerity and propriety? The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, can no longer be ignored.""

America remembers, Mr. Harrington: how can you bring the nation together in the wake of all this?" \n\nHarrington glared daggers at Goldwater. "Senator, my long standing support for Civil Rights legislation is a matter of public record. Under my leadership, the National Progressive Party will not tolerate racism and discrimination, whether by skin color or the quality of their work. A far cry from your policies, Senator Goldwater: in your America of fiscal 'propriety' and 'austerity', how many more Americans must suffer for lack of food or shelter, and be told that they deserve their lot in life?""

A smiling Johnson towered over Michael Harrington as he vigorously manhandled Harrington's arm before the cameras. Harrington, to his credit, refused to budge or flinch, a quiet force radiating against Johnson's energetic presence. \n\nTheir roles reversed as the debate kicked off, with Harrington launching into a surprising criticism of Johnson's administration. "President Johnson, your Great Society suffers from a lack of ambition. The root causes of grinding poverty, of unemployment, of the debasement of human dignity remain unaddressed. We both agree on the role of government in fundamentally bettering American lives, yet you focus on treating symptoms while ignoring the cure that millions hope to receive." \n\n"Well, Mr. Harrington, you certainly don't lack for conviction." President Johnson replied. "But when you speak of dreams, I deliver results. Ask any American on the street: are they safer, healthier, more satisfied with their life? We both agree that politics is about people; but results matter as much, if not more than, ideas in politics. And I can promise you, if you believe that the Great Society isn't ambitious enough, you ain't seen nothing yet."

But the devil was in the details, and Bennett was nothing if not a master of the details. \n\nBennett made a show of holding up Harrington's domestic policy platform - a veritable tome. "I admire your passion, Mr. Harrington. The crusade for the common man." He smiled. "But have you actually considered what it means to implement this? These programs, promising to bring the federal government into every facet of American life - you'd be talking about doubling, tripling the federal budget. Can you convince Americans why the federal government must bear all the burdens carried by our states and our communities?"  \n\nHarrington wasn't lacking for a response. "Mr. President, it's easy to say that things can't be done. But the reality is, beyond the walls of this auditorium, I have seen another America, one that suffers for want of food, dignity, and security. And this is before we factor in the struggles faced by our African-American communities! How can we claim to be the mightiest, the wealthiest nation on Earth, if we cannot feed our poor and shelter our homeless? The question is not whether we can or cannot; it isn't even a question.

"But I'd have to argue that instead of talking about ideals, you should judge a man by their results. A growing economy, surging business, the spread of American products to foreign markets. America is thriving, Governor, and I'd hate to live in a world where success is defined as failure."

Too perfect; the two seasoned politicians were too practiced to do something so crass as to let their disdain for each other show in public. \n\n"Senator, there's nothing worse in politics than broken promises. You disdain me for my principles, that in America a white man and a black man are better separated, but the voters say otherwise!" Wallace spoke as much to the camera as he did to Goldwater. "Senator Goldwater, you say you respect states' rights, yet you insist on carrying the torch of civil rights, against the wishes of these states! The voters know where I stand; can you say the same?" \n\n"I'd say that your claim to monopolize the moral high ground on a question of civil liberties is hypocrisy of the highest order," Goldwater seethed. "This republic was built on a promise of universal liberty, that all men are created equal. The states have the right to choose how to achieve this dream; they do not have the right to deny it entirely!"

The compassionate gentleman of the C-NPP and the doctrinaire conservative of the R-D's had hardly seen eye-to-eye during their years in Washington, and they weren't about to start now. \n\n"Senator Goldwater, you speak often of the need to ensure American liberty, within the framework of the respective states." Kennedy stated. "I think I speak for many when it is clear that liberty means different things in different states. That is an affront; the matter of civil rights cannot be done piecemeal and confined to individual localities; every man must be free, or nobody is free at all." \n\n"You paint me as a radical for wanting to respect the traditions of our democracy, while you demand obsequience and threaten submission for the slightest dissent. Is it not altogether more radical to refuse to accept that differences of opinion must at least be heard in your march to progress?" Goldwater shook his head. "President Kennedy, you mustn't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and I will not see America's democracy made a sacrificial lamb in the name of progress!"

The unlikely astronaut leader of the R-D's and the patrician-turned-prodigal son of the NPP faced each other on the stage, sharpening their verbal knives to draw blood from the slight differences in their dreams of a brighter future. \n\n"President Kennedy, you claim to be a man devoted to justice, to addressing society's ills." Glenn opened. "But the elderly, the poor, the pensioners, the veterans who fought for America's freedom in the last war. Their disappointment is palpable, when I talk with them; that in President Kennedy's world, some suffering is more worthy than others of redress." \n\nPresident Kennedy leaned into his podium. "Nothing could be further from the truth! The history of America is the history of how African-Americans, and the worker, have labored for far too long without any avenue to address their deprivation. I resent the accusation that our government should ignore the plight of the most deprived in the name of incrementalism, for justice delayed is justice denied."

The focus of the debate would be domestic policy - and both would be well versed in the details. The argument would not, could not, be won on its merits, but Bennett and Smith were nothing if not resourceful, and more than willing to take a few cheap shots. \n\n"President Bennett, you promised the American people stability after the tumult of Richard Nixon's impeachment." Smith smiled, before plunging her dagger home. "But a President is elected to lead, not to manage. The American people dream of moving confidently into the new decade, of reuniting with the Treaty Ports, not of smoke-filled rooms and committee minutiae. Nothing great was ever achieved by an abundance of caution." \n\nPresident Bennett's neutral expression hid his biting response. "Senator, if I have observed anything in my years in government, it is that the National Progressive Party has many dreams and many faces, to the point I have trouble hearing who speaks for the party as a whole. You accuse me of boring consistency in my commitment to maintaining the fabric of our Republic; I say that the American people prefer evolution to revolution, especially if the revolutionaries can hardly agree on what to have for breakfast, let alone their vision for the nation."

At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Republican-Democrat candidate Robert McNamara engaged his National Progressive counterpart Margaret Chase Smith in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic. Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nMcNamara: "There will soon come a time when we are obliged to fulfill our duties as the Free World's custodian once again. Deluding ourselves from acknowledging the likelihood, or the necessity, of future interventions is counterproductive folly; in that regard, I am thankful that President Smith and I are in full agreement. But I believe we also have a duty to learn from prior interventions and the mistakes we've committed in them, that we can finish said duties expediently. Here, I fear, is where the Madam President is negligent."\n\nSmith: "I won't be so easily fooled by your sales pitch, Mr. Secretary. Despite the backhanded insult you've levied on our armed forces, the fact of the matter's that we have indeed learned from mistakes like South Africa. Our forces' stellar performance in Indonesia and the Middle East has validated Mr. Rumsfeld and his reforms to the American people. Hence we can now boast a military capable of responding to attacks against the Free World at any time - and, if I might add, save Arlington thousands of crosses while doing so.""

Japan was contained within the Pacific, Germany contained within Europe. The tethers that bind the peoples they subjugate fray with every year we held the line, leaving them free to slip away as they had in Africa and Southeast Asia. Containment has been a stellar success; why should we do away with something that clearly works?"\n\nMcGovern: "And look how your four years turned out for the world, Madam President. Our enemies still field war machines by the ten thousands. Our allies still yearn for support we can give them but somehow won't. We're no more farther from nuclear war today than we were in 1968; in fact, we may even have moved closer towards it, Hawaii notwithstanding. Shouldn't we at least seek another path that delivers lasting success, rather than content ourselves with eternally seesawing between fragile peace and Armageddon?""

At the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, National Progressive candidate Michael Harrington engaged his Republican-Democrat counterpart Robert McNamara in the first of a series of televised presidential debates covering topics both foreign and domestic.\n\nThe armed forces dominated tonight's heated parlay, with President Harrington launching a slew of rebukes against the former Secretary of Defense for proposing a sizable increase of what he believed was their already excessive budget. "Imagine where we could have been today," he impressed, "if the billions we had spent on guns and bombs went instead to the millions living in our alleyways and ghettos without a cent to their name, and not end solely in the bank accounts of executives wealthier than entire states!"\n\nMcNamara retorted by reiterating America's pledge to protect the Free World from fascist encroachments - a responsibility, he argued, properly honored only with a capable military. "President Harrington has a responsibility to learn the lessons from South Africa and Indonesia and apply them for the Free World's betterment," the Secretary elaborated. "That its sworn protector disregards actions taken in its defense altogether is a grave indictment of his record as our commander-in-chief, rather than an achievement worth celebrating.""

We musn't dawdle over unseen Americas while the Free World languishes in plain sight; a balance has to be struck somehow, and I know a balance exists. If only you had endeavored to seek it."\n\nHarrington: "Are you perhaps a man of Scripture, Senator? 'The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.' I speak for an America that has lost its appetite for senseless adventures abroad; tying ourselves further with those who ask of it is no better than laying the stones that has lead to the bloodlettings we've witnessed in South Africa, Indonesia and Arabia.

Here and on the election trail you sloganize progress like it's a universal truth, rather than a privilege endowed only to certain industries, certain sectors, and certain income brackets. It's time you put the Buck Rogers down and face the hard facts: the stars will still shine long after we're gone. A poor man won't have as much time before he succumbs to hunger or disease.""

Now, years after the simmering defeat of the last great war, the government finds itself facing these enemies once more, not within the wintry dread of political machinations and espionage; rather, it is time for the United States to prepare once more for the battlefield. Now is the time for the United States to rise, and lead the march for freedom, for liberty, for democracy! \n\nThanks to the preparations of our administrations and Presidents prior, the United States has come leagues ahead of preparedness compared to our worries of the past. However, we have a long path ahead of us if we intend to defeat the enemies of America. Nevertheless, we shan't suffer again, we shall defeat these bastards, once and for all!"
USA_ww3_mobilize_the_army_desc:0 "The United States, despite the sufferings of wars lost in history's turned pages, has grown to possess one of the most effective, most respected, and most powerful armies on the world's stage. Thousands of American men and women have proven themselves as heroes of the American people in the Army. \n\nHowever, although the power within the Army remains unquestioned, we must face the realities of some issues. The Army is a ferocious beast, but a beast that must be roused to action from slumber. However, the war-cries of Americans' enemies have rung out across the world; thus, it is time to spurn our own beast to action, and let loose the true hounds of war: the United States Army. The Army must begin immediate effective mobilization in order to respond to the growing encroachment of enemy forces, while bringing the reserves to the front lines. The United States Army must be prepared to take the offensive and be ready to strike!"
USA_ww3_scramble_the_airforce_desc:0 "The skies, holding the sun, the moon, and the stars, have become the newest addition to the ways in which humanity can wage warfare. From the skies above the Marne to the storms raging above Saint-Mihiel, the United States set a precedent for the quality sought in men seeking to bring the fury of the United States Armed Forces to the heavens above. \n\nHowever, the strength of our enemies have grown to match such fury, and bring about fiery destruction with their advancements in technology and tactics, with the potential of our enemies to spread death and terror if they penetrate our air defenses. Furthermore, the administration has come to realize that the Air Force being spread out across the country has handicapped its ability to move effectively to the new warzones being created everyday. We must set the Air Force to the highest alert, and have our aerial units ready to face the enemy within a moment's notice!"
USA_ww3_emergency_naval_procurement_act_desc:0 "The Pentagon's forecast attrition rates beggar belief. Soldiers, equipment, ships, and aircraft will be written off at an astronomical rate, expended to keep the war far from the American homeland. That assumption depends on the ability of the Navy to continue to prosecute the war and supply our troops abroad. If the Pentagon's estimates are accurate, the shipyards will need to be spun up to full capacity now to make sure the Navy keeps the war away from home."
USA_ww3_naval_invasion_crash_course_desc:0 "Although the protection of a navy shows in the guarding the open waters surrounding the United States on all sides, it can be safely assumed that the United States Navy can only act as a shield around our lands for so long. The Fascists have struck quickly and viciously before, and we cannot hope that staying on the defense will save us. No, we shall penetrate the barriers of the seas to strike against our enemies shores, to plunge the sword of the American military deep into the hearts of our enemies before we dare allow them to take the first step. \n\nUnfortunately, although the plans shall be ambitious, we must prepare for such aspirations lest we intend to see our military plunge to the bottom of the seas. Thus, the administration shall immediately order the instruction of naval invasion preparation and execution to our military command. Our command will take the first step, strike first, and cut the throat of the beast before it dares to claim the lives of any more good-hearted Americans!"
USA_ww3_impliment_war_bonds_desc:0 "America's participation in the first two World Wars stretched the financial resources of the country to the limit, and the realities of modern, mechanized warfare have come at a higher cost than we could have ever imagined. Income taxation will not nearly be enough to fill the yawning chasm of the discretionary budget, and our financial institutions and capital markets are beginning to balk at the successive regular bond issuances by the Treasury. We need to take our financing drive directly to the American people, mobilizing their savings for the war effort through retail war bonds."
USA_ww3_nationalize_air_industry_desc:0 "The United States has had a long term of industrial superiority, both as it continues to grow within history, as well as when it is spurned into a furious upkeep in supporting the nation, such as what happened during the Second World War. In those years past, the people of the United States acted as the blood within the Great Dragon that awoke, allowing the production necessary to modernize the war effort in the skies above. \n\nNow, however, we, as Americans, have found ourselves facing the damning strength of our enemies. Now, what we need is not only the talent and experience of the military, but the equipment necessary to secure our superiority, especially within the skies. Thus, the administration will work towards nationalizing several airline manufacturers to bring them to support the war effort within the United States. Sure, our critics may cite this as 'feeding the Military-Industrial Complex,' but we are at war, damnit!"

Every man and every woman is prepared to defend the homeland from a potential invasion. Liberty's bell rings in the ear of every American, and we are destined to fight until our final breath. May the American eagle guide us to absolute victory! The multitudes shout 'God Bless America!' from sea to shining sea!"
USA_ww3_rally_to_the_flag_desc:0 "It is a difficult requirement to fulfill, but we must draft American citizens for the fight abroad and for homeland defense.

We're going to need all we can get for the war against our enemy, but our popularity is surely going to plummet once we implement this idea..."
USA_ww3_reinforce_the_triad_desc:0 "The superpowers of the world have built up hundreds, even thousands of nuclear warheads, ready to destroy the other powers at a moment's notice. The possibility of mutually assured destruction is very real and it could mark the end of the human race.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff quietly, but firmly, pressed his case. \n\n"There will always be more soldiers. We have our reservists, the National Guard, and the draft. But millions more men in uniform will hardly matter unless they have the equipment to take them to the fight."

A shit ton of ships for the Navy, with a price tag to match." \n\n"Not just for destroyers and submarines. We'll need oilers, hospital ships, amphibious landers and supply tankers.

And as Private Rodney Bannister was about to find out, as he sat resting in his bunk with dreams of his family and girlfriend swimming through his mind, it would be the most comfortable place he'd have the grace to pass through for a long, long time. \n\n"Get your fucking asses up, now, all of you!" Gunnery Sergeant Hewitt commanded, exploding into the dark and formerly silent resting quarters of the young soldiers. Bannister hurried to attention, as had his fellow Soldiers all around him as they all faced forwards where the Gunnery Sergeant came forward. "Get your shit together, men, the United States is at war! Get your utilities on and your asses in gear, be formed up outside the barracks at 0430, move it!" the Gunnery Sergeant exploded before leaving the room. The glass of stability which had continuously wavered in strength for Bannister was shattered as the Gunnery Sergeant left the room. Sure, he'd trained and all for the prospect of serving his country, but he never expected the day would come when everything went to hell like this. Bannister threw his uniform together as best he could and hurried out, along with the rest of his platoon. \n\nOutside, the frigid air of an early Kentucky morning was evident, but the rush of fear and terror was what truly crawled up the soldiers that morning. Standing at attention, Bannister stared forward as he saw his Gunnery Sergeant come into frame, yelling to his platoon, "The United States of America has, as all of you know, entered a state of war with the same men responsible for our defeat in the 1940's. Some of your fathers know that all too well, some of them may have even fought alongside myself back in England. All of that has come back, and we will not allow those bastards to harass the world any longer. Your platoon is being transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where you will all undergo extensive training to prepare for deployment out to fight those who think they can fuck with the goddamned United States. Hooah, soldiers." the Gunnery Sergeant concluded. \n\nAs Private Bannister continued forward with the rest of his platoon to get onto the trucks heading to Fort Carson. But no matter what, he couldn't shake the fear out of his head. This was it, what if he never got to see Jennifer again? Or, what about the rest of his family, and his little brother?

She'd always been that way whenever Isaac decided to go to one of the school dances. Rather, he found himself in a somber atmosphere as his mom drove him down the Pennsylvanian road to the Army office in Harrisburg. Finally, the car came to a halt right in front of the big brick building. He felt his mother's tears grace his cheek as they hugged one last time before he walked towards the building. \n\nThe inside was an absolute disaster. Hundreds, if not nearly a thousand boys like him had received the same yellow slip titled "Order to Report for Induction" notifying him of his draft into the military. He waited his turn in line for hours until finally, he exchanged his paperwork with the woman behind the desk, approving him for his conscripted entrance into the United States Army after a quick physical and mental health check and approval test with the words "infantrymen" written on top. A few days later, he looked out the window of the moving truck, thinking of how he was going to be toting a rifle on some battlefield, surrounded by blood and filth, instead of studying economics at Stanford like the plan was.. However, the journey didn't end there, as he sat while his hair was nearly shaved off by the Army barbers at Fort Carson. Finally, a Staff Sergeant came over to the new recruits, yelling, "Welcome to the United States Army, gentlemen. The United States has gone to war and we need your talent to serve the armed forces now more than ever." His voice droned on, but Isaac picked up as he heard the Staff Sergeant continue, "...Summers, Drake, Clarence, you eight are gonna be led by Corporal Bannister." as the soldier moved forward to the rightmost of the squad. Now, out in the middle of Colorado, was where the army's finest will find their way to the front lines. \n\nThe mud continued to gunk up Isaac's teeth as the barbed wire scraped against his ankles, as the recruit crawled and gunshots popped above him at the firing ranges nearby. All of a sudden, a hand popped in front of him beneath the barbed wire, and Corporal Bannister's face came out of the blur. "Come on, man, I've got you." The corporal said, as he helped pull Isaac forward. Isaac felt a genuine care and concern within the Corporal's voice as he got through it, feeling a connection to his squad leader."

His feelings had devolved from resentment to a difficult mix of steadfastness and dread as the ship journeyed onwards. The Private's thoughts had almost drowned out the stomping of boots behind him as his squad leader, Corporal Bannister approached, rousing Summers to attention. \n\n"You're fine, Summers, take the time to enjoy yourself." Bannister said to the young Private, who looked troubled. "Thinking ahead?" the Corporal asked, thinking about the weeks they had spent travelling aboard the John Pope.. "Honestly, sir, no. Thinking about the past, more like, thinking of everything before all of this, before, well, the draft went out, uh, sir." He said while looking out into the waves crashing on the side of the boat. "Yeah, I get that, Summers. I didn't get that whole draft thing, I was down at the most comfortable base in Kentucky, thinking about how serving the country could help out paying for the wedding with my Jennifer. Think she's gonna be pissed with how long I'll be gone." The Corporal said, chuckling. Noticing his squadling's less than enthusiastic response, he asked, "Well, what about you, Summers? Where are you from?" The Private took a minute to respond, thinking of everything leading up to now. "Came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, just graduated out of high school, finalizing my application to Stanford to study economics, was thinking of going federal with the job. Managed to get top of my class too, things were looking great. Sure, no girlfriend, like you, sir, and only a mom back at home, but it looks like the world had other plans." \n\nThe Corporal heard the Private's downtrodden voice, and offered a pat on the back. "Hey, I wasn't a Stanford kid, and economics aren't my forte, but what's to say we have to be sad about it. Things are rough, but the country needs us, good people like your mother needs us, now more than ever. If you wanted to help change the world, you've found your way there, Summers, because America needs people like you who can grit their teeth and keep going.

Maurine Neuberger, Scoop's deputy and fellow senator in the NPP's Center wing, quietly thumbed through her notes as she waited for him to speak. Next to her sat the nominal head of the Center's more radical wing, Michael Harrington, who waited with the same expectant look as Scoop himself. The two could not be more different, but as the Center's leader, Scoop knew he needed both if the party was going to get anywhere.\n\n"As you know, our election prospects are still looking dire," began Scoop. "The Right still holds plenty of influence over the party, and no progressive voter is going to vote for the party whose last candidate was Strom goddamn Thurmond. Worst of all, we still don't even have a candidate!"\n\n"Well it would help if anyone had bothered to put their name forward," joked Harrington, with a bare hint of contempt. "Perhaps if we were to do more to support our core working class voters in the Midwest and elsewhere rather than kowtowing to segregationists... and filling our ranks with West Coast elitist types-"\n\nNeuberger, herself of proud Oregon stock, sat up with an offended look. "Everyone here is fighting for the same thing! I've done plenty to speak up for the underprivileged - at least I don't just sit around writing essays about it!"\n\nScoop sat still for a moment, smiling bemusedly as his colleagues continued to bicker and snipe at one another. In a way, they were a perfect reflection of the Center as a whole - determined to enact change, but endlessly at its own throat about what that change should be. Finally, he coughed, and the other two immediately ceased their childish exchange and looked to him once more. "You are both very different, which is exactly why we need somebody who can speak everyone's language. If we're to have any hope in this election, we need to move forwards with one voice."\n\nHarrington and Neuberger looked at each other unsure of what to say. Scoop glanced out the window with an uncertain look. "I don't know who the man to lead us is. But he better show up soon. Or we are screwed.""

Vice President John Fitzgerald Kennedy sat thoughtfully chewing on a turkey sandwich. Opposite him sat a smiling man who the party registry knew as his chief of staff, but who John had always known as his brother.\n\n"It's been too long since we've taken time to ourselves," said John with a smile. "How are you, Bobby? Ethel still taking good care of you I hope?"\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy laughed at the playful wink his brother gave him. "I can hardly complain on the home life, Jack." His grin faded. "Still, current events haven't exactly been great for my sleep."\n\nThe older Kennedy nodded sympathetically. "The violence is getting worse, for sure." He frowned. "Nixon being a stick in the mud about it isn't helping things either. He still won't endorse any legislation on the matter."\n\n"Can't you do something about it? As long as the President sits on the fence, things will only get worse."\n\n"I'd love to, but you know how Nixon is," muttered John, idly stirring his coffee. "Knowing him he'd probably just veto whatever we put in front of him and yell at us for 'fracturing party unity'.\n\n"But this is far more important than party unity Jack! There are millions of Americans - millions of good, honest people - being cast aside for things that are far beyond their control. The longer we wait, the greater their suffering will be." Fixing his brother with an intense but encouraging look, he continued. "You're the Vice President. At the very least you can use your voice in the name of those who have no voice."\n\nJohn was silent for a moment. Then he smiled. "You've always been a good man, Bobby. You are right, of course, I must act.""

The circumstances aren't ideal, but I can think of no better man to be President right now." Robert could barely contain his adoring smile. "Think of all the things we can finally accomplish!"\n\n"Come on, Bobby, you're embarrassing me," chuckled John, who beamed nonetheless. "But thank you. I know I can always count on you."\n\n"Always. Like I'd leave you for the NPP or anyone else, especially when you're about to give this country the change it so desperately deserves!"\n\nRobert's enthusiasm, seemingly infectious, prompted more laughs from his brother. "Now, now, we have a lot of work to get through before we can set things in motion." His look became more serious, more determined. "The party's image is somewhat tarnished at the moment with the Nixon fiasco, so I've arranged some trips across the country to shore up support." At this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long itinerary of events and dates in various states and cities and handed it to Robert.\n\n"Of course. We do have the election to worry about." Robert frowned, before reverting to a smile. "Come on Jack, I suppose we can just enjoy this meal before your big tour, you've earned it."\n\nAnd so the brothers sat for a while longer, enjoying their food in peace. As the time finally came for them to leave, Robert quickly glanced at the list and noted his brother's first destination. He smiled at his brother one last time before they departed.\n\n"I know you'll do great Jack. I'll see you when you get back from Dallas.""

Kennedy could not hold back his tears.\n\nHe was supposed to give a big speech about his brother's legacy, about the strength and dedication of his character and how he was an example to all within the halls of power. That was true enough, but as he sat in the holding area awaiting his cue, he could only think of John as the brother he had looked up to. His greatest inspiration and his closest friend. He wondered if he should just call it off, so great was his grief. Grief, and anger.\n\nJohn was killed because he was the president. He was only the president because of the Republican-Democrats. Because of Nixon lying like a bitch and doing everything in his power to stop progress and change, killing the Civil Rights Act and forcing John to step up to the firing line in the most damnably literal way. The party had chewed him up and spat him out. They had used him, just like they had used the entire Kennedy family and dragged their name through the mud.\n\nWhen a staffer poked their head into the room to wave him on stage, Robert stilled his tears, and prepared to give what would become one of the most shocking speeches of his career. After slowly ascending to the podium, he addressed the assembled crowd, giving a short but passionate eulogy in honor of his brother, extolling his candor, his way with words, and his dedication to America. The crowd nodded along, some cried, some bowed their heads. But none of them could prepare for what came next.\n\n"My brother was loyal to the Republican-Democrats through and through. He was loyal as they made every effort to avoid bringing this country true equality and justice. He was loyal as they charged blindly into an unnecessary and bloody war in Africa. He was loyal as he was ignored until the time where they needed a man to clean up their mistakes, and he was loyal as the fallout of their ignorance resulted in the loss of his life." He paused as many in the crowd stared agape. At least two from the party mouthed words of astonishment and curses at him. His next line would live on in infamy.\n\n"I was loyal to the Republican-Democrats also. That ends today"."

He wondered if what he was doing was too much, or if anyone would take him seriously given that he had been an establishment stooge for far too long. Still, he had to try.\n\nFinally, the door to the office swung open. In walked Scoop Jackson, closely followed by his underlings Neuberger and Harrington. The three regarded Kennedy curiously yet hopefully as they sat opposite him, each shaking his hand in turn.  Scoop was the first to speak. "This is certainly unusual. But I hear good things about you, Mr Kennedy. We have a few questions for you before we go any further."\n\nOver the next twenty minutes, the impromptu Center committee picked Robert's brains over a wide variety of issues. "How committed are you to the Civil Rights Act?" asked Scoop. "You agree that the state of healthcare in this country is disgraceful?" asked Harrington. "Don't you think this country should do more to protect the environment?" asked Neuberger. It felt almost like a college debate club, but Robert answered all their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically.\n\nAs their questioning came to a close, Robert spoke up. "The Republican-Democrats no longer represent this country, nor are they willing to do what is necessary for its people. I want to join you because I feel that you represent the change that I believe in... and the change that my brother believed in."\n\nScoop glanced sideways to his associates.

It occurred to him that if every human being had the opportunity to see what he could see - how insignificant all the struggles and wars and vendettas were - the world might finally know peace. A peace where everyone could work towards the advancement of science, prosperity and-\n\nA sudden ringing cut across his psyche, and he was jolted from a dream of days past. Sitting sluggishly awake from his sadly earthbound bed, he fumbled for the telephone on his bedside cabinet and pulled the receiver to his ear. "John Glenn, speaking - way too early in the morning might I add."\n\nA panicked voice came across the line. "John, it's James. Have you heard the news?"\n\nGlenn rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and replied "James Edwin Webb, I have not even got out of bed yet. Be more specific-"\n\n"They're defunding NASA!"\n\nA hastily-made coffee and frantic flip through the morning paper later, and John Glenn felt a wrench in his gut as he faced the prospect of his life's work being all for naught. "So what, the Germans got to the moon first and that just means space is over? What can we do? They can't just give up on the future!"\n\n"Nixon's already made his mind up. He wants to move the money over to the military and other 'practical projects'". Webb paused as Glenn made an outraged intake of breath. "I really don't think there's anything that can stop him at this point. I'm sorry, John."\n\nGlenn felt himself back in the rivierre of space flight. The government could not let the dream of space be but a dream. America had to live to see the stars. "Nothing we can do? We'll see about that.""

Now, he needed to make a big splash.\n\n"I had just been having a pleasant dream about my last mission, when my good friend James Webb woke me with the news. I was distraught, to say the least, to know that the government was giving up on the future of space travel. Partly because the thought of never going up there myself again is saddening to consider, but that's not the only reason.\n\n"By ending our involvement in space, President Nixon has given up. He has accepted stagnation and decline, abandoning the stars to the fascist powers. He says we 'lost' the space race, but as long as the stars still shine space will never be lost. I implore that the President reconsider his options. The future of America, and the human species as a whole, lies above us."\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, Glenn made his closing remarks, and was greeted with raucous applause. He felt satisfied that his words had hit their mark, and with so many journalists in attendance tomorrow's papers would carry them further still. Yet he still felt defeated. His words alone would not be enough to save NASA.\n\nIf American space travel was to have a future, it would need a voice to represent it in the halls of power. John Glenn had never been one for politics, but as he thought on it, he realised that political office may be his best course of seeing his dream fulfilled.

The American currency is over reliant on the silver standard. What I am proposing is really not that radical - all the Silver Act suggests is that we reduce that reliance both within the federal budget and in the private sector." This was perhaps the third time he had explained this simple concept to the assembled senators, and many were listening intently, but Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen to enact his characteristic bullish persona to derail the discussion.\n\n"And I also say it's pretty simple - that you are wasting time arguing over which metal we base our currency on. Last I checked, America was still an economic giant by all accounts, so I really fail to see the merit of this passion project of yours." Johnson scoffed as he leaned informally against his desk, and Bennett felt his blood pressure steadily rise at the lack of respect.\n\n"We can be so much stronger though, Mr Johnson. Myself and my colleagues have done much research into the matter. We haven't even begun to get into the hard data - allow me to show you the charts-"\n\n"I will gladly look at your graphs, Mr Bennett, but given the times we live in, I still say that silver is a rather small thing to get worked up over." Johnson chuckled idly as Bennett launched into more discussion, clearly not listening.\n\nBelittling as always, thought Bennett. Johnson was supposed to be his ally. The Republicans and the Democrats were supposed to be allies. Yet even the Center and Right NPP seemed to have a better and more equal relationship than the two sides of his party did these days. As a Democrat, Bennett felt increasingly sidelined. That would have to change, he decided then and there.\n\nAfter the ultimately fruitless discussion came to a close, the two men passed each other as the senators left the hall for lunch. Bennett fixed Johnson with the steeliest glare his mild-mannered persona could muster. "Something's gotta change round, Johnson. And I'm gonna be the one to do something about it.""

USA_IR.1.d:0 "In recent years, we have seen Persia become a wide breeding ground for oppression and ruthless authoritarianism during the rule of Pahlavi. Pressures from Berlin and Tokyo have caused a cave-in for the fragile political structure of the once-proud nation. However, the people have started to speak out against tyranny, and our shining opportunity is developing itself right before our eyes. The National Front, formerly outlawed under the Shah's one-party dynasty, has made a resurgence in the local population, and every class seems to show its support: farmers, soldiers, and noblemen alike. In a surprising referendum directed at the parliament, the people demanded free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, among others. The result? Over two hundred "freedom fighters" dead, over a thousand wounded. Angered at this sight, democratic politicians continued to speak out against the Shah, all while building up a competent army in the southern half of the country along the Zagros Mountains and the Persian coast. A constitution was signed and the new Republic of Iran seceded only a few hours ago. \n\nPersia is the gate through which the Caucasus, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East can be accessed. We also don't want the barbaric German eagle spreading his talons over the oil reserves in Iran. With a friendly government, any chance the Germans have at filling up their Panzers with Persian oil is slim. If the Liberals win this conflict, they could be our "experiment" with democracy in the region, a beacon of hope for the peoples of the Middle East. We must be hasty; the frail democracy is already on the defensive."

Until our equipment can reach the Persian coast, we have invested $100 million to keep the Liberals fighting. Furthermore, this bill ensures our lasting cooperation with the Republic of Iran, and we are now committed to keeping the candle lit for as long as possible. \n\nAlready, as the money flows into the newly established nation, the locals have been praising us for our swift efforts. We have also been getting positive reports from the population here, and it seems people are more eager to combat oppression in Iran than in any other war in the past decade. We cannot fail the public now."

Two options were given: we either send our own men into combat to directly influence the course of the war, or we supply the National Front from a distance and let the Iranians be the ones fighting. \n\nThe advisers supporting direct involvement argue that offensives will be carried out quicker and that results will be seen much faster. Our troops are much more trained and ready than the Liberal troops. Americans may die on the battlefield but the overall number of casualties will be lower than if we only sent weapons. Officers supporting indirect involvement claim that if the U.S. Army lands on Persian soil, it could bring Germany or Japan into the conflict, and that is certainly not in our best interests. The public isn't showing support for this kind of intervention either, and it would take a resounding victory to even dent their disapproval. \n\nThe advisers supporting indirect involvement claim that, first and foremost, less Americans will be sacrificed for freedom. We can trust that the Iranians are capable of using the latest technologies we have to offer. The introduction of our arsenal is enough of a boost for the National Front troops. The Germans and Japanese are less likely to intervene if we only send supplies. Critics believe this will produce a larger death toll and the war will be drawn out longer. \n\nWe either send troops and risk it all or we trust the National Front to take care of the job using our technology."

This time, the U.S. must decide whether its soldiers will attempt a swift advance to end the war or prepare for the long haul war of attrition. If we send enough soldiers in to overwhelm the enemy, there is a clear chance the war would end once Tehran capitulates. However, if this advance fails, there will be a monumental loss of American life, and the war might as well be lost. It is a big risk, but if our troops can pull it off, the war will be won handily and we have our Middle Eastern ally. \n\nAlternatively, we can expect the long-term war from the start and try to wear down our foe over time. The war may be longer, but we would have no risk of failing and embarrassing ourselves on the world stage again. At the same time, there would be no chance of a swift victory. This route allows for a greater conservation of resources and all our soldiers would have to do is hold out longer. The idea may not sit well with the average soldier, but it is meant to keep him safe. \n\nIn conclusion, our military either risks the entire operation on one single offensive, or we hold everything in the trenches and wait for the enemy to attack us. It is a matter of offensive or defensive; risk or no risk. Time is not of the essence."

The two had become friends in a deep Georgia training camp seven years ago. Both had older brothers who faced hell in South Africa. \n\n"How could we just... give up on this war?" \n\nAmerican forces held time and time again, but any offensive they tried just couldn't break through the rough enemy defenses. Once the U.S. lost enough men, generals made the quick decision to pull out and leave the war solely to the Liberals. Not even a day after the last U.S. soldier left Iran did the National Front sign a peace agreement. The leaders of the movement were subsequently executed by firing squad. \n\nThe public did not greet the returning soldiers with the respect they were promised. Many were spat on and some were even attacked. Nevertheless, our soldiers did the best they could to promote freedom abroad, and those who made the ultimate sacrifice will be given a proud funeral. The fall of the Iranian National Front marks the end of any hope for democracy in the Middle East. The dream of liberty has escaped the hearts of Iranians, never to be seen again."

Though we suffered significant casualties, what matters is that we finally have a partner in the Middle East that we can count on. Negotiations with the new government have started and we believe they will continue promoting our cause as long as we help them rebuild. \n\nA handful of our soldiers remain in the country to subdue any rebel factions that could harm Iranian leadership. Since Tehran also suffered serious damage, our engineers chose to stay behind so that the city would be rebuilt. In accordance with the Iranian Aid Bill, we have also sent economic and industrial advisers to the new government. \n\nThe rebuilding of Iran will take time, but when it is complete, our sole ally in the Middle East will be even more formidable than it was before the war.

 USA.culture.1.desc:0 "A spokesman for the Kennedy family reports today that former president Joseph P. Kennedy passed away in his Massachusetts home at 81. He is survived by his wife and six children.\n\nThe elder Kennedy leaves behind a complicated legacy. His success as patriarch of the Kennedy dynasty was substantial, as his sons John, Robert, and Edward all made names for themselves in the political sphere. The elder Kennedy was elected president in 1932 and presided over the slow recovery of the United States from the Great Depression. Despite serious criticisms for his non-interventionist policy, both in economic and foreign policy, he won a second term in 1936.\n\nThis second term was mainly defined by Kennedy's continued reluctance to intervene in the European war, and failure to fully prepare the United States for global power projection against Japan or Germany. Kennedy was the source of much criticism in the aftermath of his presidency, which only increased after the failed intervention in England and the signing of the Akagi Accords by his successor, Harry Truman. The Democrats would not hold the White House for another two decades, when his son, John F. Kennedy, succeeded the disgraced President Richard Nixon.\n\nKennedy had spent the years after the presidency retired from public life, having lost his son Joe Jr. in a bombing raid over the Pacific, but he reemerged to help with his son's bid for the vice presidency. However, the elder Kennedy kept himself out of the public eye, due to widespread criticism of comments he made advocating detente with Germany to focus on confronting Japan, and refused to help with his son Robert's presidential run in 1964.\n\nRegardless of how the American people remember him, Kennedy left a lasting mark on the nation's history, and his family will most likely continue to have a major role in politics for the foreseeable future."

The draftees in boot camp continue to curse their fate, and their drill sergeants, but a tad quieter, relieved that their service might be a peaceful one. \n\nIn the Pentagon, planners quietly vacate their desks for a longer-than-usual smoke break, their immediate work mercifully concluded. Concluded, that is, until the inevitable orders come to prepare for the soldiers' return. And in the White House, the President receives another briefing, their thoughts unknowable beneath a facade of practiced calm. \n\nAcross America, the nation welcomes the first day after the South African War. Tomorrow, America will grieve the dead and embrace its returning heroes - and start coming to terms with the horrors of the war in the Veldt, and its consequences."

 USA.culture.3.desc:0 "It seemed as soon as the boat docked at the Norfolk, VA port that Jonathan Stafford, soldier of the 134th "Jayhawk" Plains Division, would finally find peace after years of turmoil in the South African War. He was born to a poor farming couple in central Kansas and learned to drive a tractor when he was only seven years old. His skill with a rifle came when he crossed the border into Arkansas and began hunting wild hogs to feed his mother and father. When he turned eighteen he was faced with a dilemma: either join the Army and provide parents a substantial income, or stay on the farm for eternity. Once the recruiters arrived at the farm, Jonathan's parents would not see their son again for another six years.\n\nTraining came and went, and before he knew it, Jonathan's division was sent off to Port Elizabeth. The Jayhawk Division, organized in Kansas, was well-prepared for the lowly plains of South Africa, but mastering the terrain was only one step in the process of combat. Stafford himself was involved in several offensives against the Germans and pulled together several kills, but his involvement ended when he was shot in the shoulder. While he was being taken to cover, an advancing German shot another two bullets into his wrist and hand. The wounds were not fatal and Stafford fully recovered, but, much to his chagrin, he was sent back home.\n\nNow, Stafford was a very proud American, and he hoped the general public would hail him as a hero who fought for his country. To put it bluntly, he received the exact opposite: protesters spat on him, threw dirt in his face, and even tried to frame him for murder. Students from Kansas State found his address and attempted to set his parents' farm ablaze, but police arrested them before they could act. The public response to Stafford's actions was possibly even more scarring than his experience in the war."

 USA.culture.4.desc:0 "When the soldiers arrived home, several were inspired to document their adventures in book form, where they would live forever in the printed word. These stories, ranging from poems to novels, detailed the barbarism of plains warfare. Many described common heroics and regular combat against the opposing Germans. However, not one story had gained as much attention as Hal Moore's We Were Young Soldiers. A New York Times bestseller in its first three weeks of publication, the novel chronicles Colonel Hal Moore's adventures as a commander in 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry.\n\n"The savanna was harsh, hot, and desperately in need of action. Laying in the bushes for hours on end was grueling, but if you were tired of being on the ground, the Germans were not afraid to shoot. Sometimes they'd shoot anyway. I couldn't imagine how frightened my men must have been."\n\nOne thrilling part of the novel focuses on Moore's successful gamble to ambush an important German position, and how it resulted in twenty German deaths and a hundred captured POWs. The superb commentary of the event was likened to that of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, and reviewers have considered it one of the greatest military novels of all-time. One newspaper argued that the novel is "the one military journal you must read before you die.""

Set in the next millennium, "2001" centers around the German spaceship Entdeckung Eins, on a long journey to Jupiter.  Its crew, Andreas Bogenmann and Franz Teich, are helped in their day-to-day activities by the powerful artificial intelligence EPAC.  However, as the film goes on, it becomes clear that EPAC has decided to kill the crew.  \n\nIn a tense struggle, made all the more nerve-wracking by Kubrick's long takes and understated sound design, Bogenmann is able to deactivate EPAC, who mournfully sings "Stille Nacht" as his circuits are disconnected.  Bogenmann then realizes that the mission of Entdeckung Eins is to investigate an alien monolith orbiting Jupiter.  The monolith transports Bogenmann across space and time, transforming him into a bizarre space fetus floating beside Earth.  \n\nAudiences have been divided over the film.  Some call it meaningless drivel, while others have found it to be most enjoyable, especially when paired with certain substances.  Whatever the reaction, Kubrick has certainly created a memorable feature film!"

To American audiences, the thought that someone could just order a nuclear attack on a whim was something that could only happen from Germania or Tokyo, not in the good ol' USA. The flailing efforts to recall the bombers, and the German revelation of a Doomsday Device that would kill all life on earth as the bombers head for Japan just further confounds the audience's expectations. The movie showed that everyone, from the unnamed yet all powerful and raving Nazi Fuhrer and the over-ceremonial puppet Japanese Emperor were just as incompotent as any corrupt politican elected in the US, espeically in the face of nuclear armageddon...\n\n ...Yet, "Dr. Strangelove" is much more than a surreal look at mid-20th Century fears of nuclear war. It will be recognized by future generations as a classic of filmmaking. Kubrick's obsessive attention to detail in everything from the camera work to the exact facial expressions of the actors on screen. The brilliant acting of Peter Sellers in three separate roles: as a British emigre RCAF officer who tries to restrain the American general, the unready and soft-spoken President of the US thrust into a diplomatic crisis, and the creepy and comedic Dr. Strangelove, a Russian scientist who has some crazy ideas of how to rebuild the US in the aftermath of the now inevitable nuclear war involving cross-breeding people with plants. The over the top and hammy acting of George C. Scott as he reveals just how the world was to end with American B-52's flying low over the Kanto Plains, with his arms stretched out and making sound effects with his mouth. The cowboy riding the bomb down like a bull at a Texas rodeo to obliterate a Japanese military base, and finally the montage of nuclear bombs exploding to the haunting "Maybe" by The Ink Spots... \n\n ...it is, perhaps, the perfect dark comedy: funny in the face of terror, horrifying despite the levity. It brings in stark contrast the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction to an audience that just didn't quite comprehend the fact that a nuclear war will be the last war.

The novel discusses the issues of poverty in the United States and exposes readers to the significant number of Americans living below the poverty line. Harrington claims that many poor residents live in social isolation and are not commonly seen by the middle and upper classes. He calls for politicians to take "immediate and remedial action" to rid the country of every aspect of poverty.\n\nCritics of the novel disagree with Harrington's socialist tendencies, but most readers agree with the call to action.

Drawing from their failures with the Pinto, Ford set out to effectively downsize their flagship muscle car into a form suiting the American family's increasingly tight purses.\n\nThe end result is the second-generation Mustangs, or the Mustang IIs, released with aplomb today. Seemingly satisfied with this compromise between economy and style, men with means have gone out to purchase Ford's new-old car in droves.

Much like the frontier, Adriatica is rife with outlaws and constabularies, saloons of sin and banks of marble, and poor settlers caught in the middle as they toil a miserable living out of sands streaked with blood and oil. Never in the present has there been a depiction of this mythical age truer than Italy's youngest province.\n\nItalian filmmaker Sergio Leone demonstrated his awareness of such when he released For a Few Dollars More late this year. Featuring up-and-coming Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood as a rough, tough-speaking mercenary, the movie brought new life to an old genre while introducing its own refreshing themes. Standoffs between lawmen and bandits in desolate mining towns were joined with the ambitions of laconic bounty hunters and long-held grudges, tied together in a captivating plot centered around a heist. Though the film depicted America's Old West, the conflicts it had shown resonated with the Italian pioneers seeking their fortunes in their country's new frontier.\n\nDespite less than stellar reception from film critics for its over-the-top violence and "campy" tone, the film nevertheless broke records by reaching $4 million in ticket sales in Italy by year's end. North America added an extra $14 million to the film's gross revenue, proving that there is a place for the now-termed "Spaghetti Western" in the Free World's silver screens. Already rumors abound of a sequel, and directors and studios hint of filming their own reimaginations of a bygone era in the very same savannahs that evinced its stories in the hearts and minds of millions."

 USA.culture.26.t:0 ""All the President's Men" Blows the lid on the Box Office"
 USA.culture.26.desc:0 "Hollywood took on the political wildfire of the Nixon Presidency this past weekend as the critically acclaimed film "All the President's Men" stormed theaters across the United States. Critics from the Chicago Sun-Times have regarded the movie as being "a brilliant showcasing of the depth of investigative journalism, as paranoia, self-doubt, and harassment dominate the cases of the heroes of the Washington Post." The movie soared to reach a cemented number one spot at the box office as Americans rushed to see the political thriller. \n\nDirector Alan J. Pakula provides the American audience a journey across the spheres of journalism, writing, and politics as the film looks into the journeys of renowned reporting duo Katharine Graham and David Halberstam as they take on the haunting shadows which peer over their every move. Together, the duo follows one step after another in the journey to unveil a secretive and dangerous conspiracy involving the White House administration, scaling all the way up to former President Richard Nixon himself, who, just two years ago, resigned from his office as President of the United States. Graham and Halberstam served as writing leads behind the movie itself, with Graham stating that "David and I wanted to deliver a trek through the perils that came with the Nixon scandal as we had experienced: terrifying, back-breaking, and, well, exhilarating. As every time we felt our hearts' racing, we wanted the audience to feel that rush just the same." \n\nThat being said, key figures within the Republican-Democrat Party have come forward in criticism of the movie, with the Republican-Democrats stating that "it puts a hole through our work in trying to help the United States." Meanwhile, spokespersons within the National Progressive Party have stated their "appreciation within Graham, Halberstam, and Pakula's work." Nevertheless, despite political experts' criticism, the American audience has driven in scores to theaters across the country to enjoy the "film of the decade," as some have called it."

 USA.culture.27.t:0 "The Godfather Releases!"
 USA.culture.27.desc:0 "	Acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola's newest, biggest feature film, "The Godfather", has struck like lightning at theatres across America!  Based on Mario Puzo's bestselling crime novel of the same name, "The Godfather" tells the story of the Corleone family, of New York City's most powerful organized crime syndicates.  Its don, Vito Corleone, is an honorable and respected Sicilian immigrant.  His position among New York's Five Families, though, is being threatened by the growing heroin trade.  This conflict spirals into a bloody gang war, which claims Sonny, Vito's eldest child.  After Vito promises to end the war, his second son, Michael, a veteran of Scotland, begins to take control of the Corleone empire.  In 1955, Vito dies, and Michael exacts his revenge on the Five Families in a vicious series of assassinations, establishing his status as the new Godfather of the Mafia.  \n\n"The Godfather" has garnered rave reviews.  Critics around the country are praising the performances of the legendary Marlon Brando as Vito, and the budding young Al Pacino as Michael.  Others have acclaimed the score, editing, and the themes of immigration and family, seeing it as a parable for America's complicated relationship to Italy.  Many are already calling "The Godfather" the best film of 1972.  It would seem that Mr. Coppola has made Hollywood an offer it can't refuse..."

 USA.culture.28.desc:0 "The fifteen riders gathered at the Greyhound terminal in Washington D.C., waiting for the next bus. \n\nIt'd been years since the first Freedom Riders had stood there, knowing that they would be placing themselves at risk as they traveled into the segregated South. And trouble had followed their forebears every step of the way - arrests in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Mississippi before the horrendous beatings and arson attacks by the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama. \n\nA black man, in his thirties, turned to a white woman, in her twenties, fidgeting next to him. "Nervous?" \n\nThe woman nodded. "I got the training and everything, but - nothing really prepares you for what you see on the news." \n\n"No, it doesn't prepare you. Not all the way, anyway." The man replied somberly, before offering a burn-scarred hand. "Name's Marlow. Ask me anything; it's not my first time on a Freedom Ride." \n\nThe woman gingerly took Marlow's hand. "April," she mouthed. She tried not to look at the scars. "Why did you come back?" \n\nMarlow looked at his hands. "The first time is scary, I know. Even if you know you're doing the right thing." He looked at the twelve people waiting alongside them. "But after my first ride, I knew I had to come back for our brother and sisters, fighting the good fight.""

 USA.culture.30.desc:0 ""Man is a part of nature, and his war against nature is a war against himself."\n\nThese were a few of the chilling words marine biologist Rachel Carson used to decry America's ignorant addiction to pesticides in her newly-released book Silent Spring. A product of nearly four years of original research into government-funded eradication campaigns, the four hundred-page publication asserts that the chemicals used for pest removal -- DDT, aminotriazole, 2,4-D -- harm far more than the vermin they were made to exterminate. They instead seep into the soil and render it impotent, she claims, and linger in the fruits and crops Americans eat.\n\nIn response to the accusations, DuPont and Velsicol Chemical have filed libel suits against the researcher. Their efforts to preserve their standing have thus far, however, been stymied by both the court of law and the court of public opinion. The book itself has shot up to first place in the New York Times' Best Sellers for Nonfiction: A sign of the American people's approval of a whistleblower increasingly compared to Upton Sinclair. Leading scientists now remark that a nationwide ban of the synthetic poisons America's laboratories peddle is now only a matter of when."

 USA.culture.31.t:0 "The Feminine Mystique"
 USA.culture.31.desc:0 ""The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the mind of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. \n\n'Over and over women heard in voices of tradition and Freudian sophistication that they could desire no greater destiny than to glory in their own femininity... The American housewife - freed by science and labor-saving appliances from the drudgery, the dangers of childbirth, and the illnesses of her grandmother... In the fifteen years after World War II, this mystique of feminine fulfillment became the cherished and self-perpetuating core of contemporary American culture.'\n\n'But on an April morning in 1959, I heard a mother of four, having coffee with four other mothers in a suburban development fifteen miles from New York, say in a tone of quiet desperation, 'the problem.' And the others knew, without words, that she was not talking about a problem with her husband, or her children, or her home... Later, after they had picked up their children at nursery school and taken them home to nap, two of the women cried, in sheer relief, just to know they were not alone...'\n\n"I begin to feel I have no personality. I'm a server of food and a putter-on of pants and a bedmaker, somebody who can be called on when you want something. But who am I?" -- Betty Freidan, The Feminine Mystique"

 USA.culture.32.desc:0 "From the sun-drenched hills, revanche-laden neighborhoods, and wild underground economies of the Bay Area, comes the debut novel of one Ken Kesey: "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".  It's bizarre, profane, provocative, and a gauntlet thrown onto the table of American literature.\n\nInspired by Kesey's work as a psychiatric orderly in Menlo Park, California, the novel follows one Randle McMurphy.  McMurphy, a veteran of Scotland and proud street brawler, is sentenced to time in a psychiatric hospital for battery and illicit gambling.  There, he meets a number of characters, including the novel's narrator, "Chief" Bromden, and the tyrannical head nurse, Nurse Ratched.  Over the course of the novel, McMurphy challenges Ratched's rule, standing up for himself and the other patients in the ward.  He is rewarded for this with a lobotomy, courtesy of Ratched.  The novel ends with Bromden smothering McMurphy in an act of mercy, before escaping to freedom.\n\n"Cuckoo's Nest" has already garnered its fair share of accolades and controversy alike.  Many are calling it a portrayal of America's own authoritarian systems, in an age when the nation is supposedly a bastion of liberty in the world.  Hollywood star Kirk Douglas is rumored to be seeking the adaptation rights, while schools across America are rumored to be banning it."

 USA.culture.33.t:0 ""Hard Hat Riot" Breaks Out in New York!"
 USA.culture.33.desc:0 "The whole debacle began when a group of college students decided to hold a demonstration in New York. Enough was enough, they said: America must leave South Africa immediately. War was good for absolutely nothing but the pockets of Death's business-suited merchants, and neither rhetoric nor propaganda can sway their commitment to peace and love for all men. So with their long flowing hair and picket signs and slogans, they packed Wall and Broad Streets by the thousands to profess their unconditional demands.\n\nThe city's working men disagreed. Among their most vocal is Peter J. Brennan, president of an alliance of New York's largest construction and engineering unions. To a man he and his fellow unionmen agreed: America had a moral obligation to protect democracy from fascism's encroachments not just at home, but also abroad. Dissent from the war effort was tantamount to treason. So with their hard hats, Old Glories and steel-toed boots, two hundred construction workers coalesced into a counter-protest in Federal Hall to profess their unconditional patriotism.\n\nAll that kept a semblance of order was a thin, shaky border of policemen sandwiched between two raucuous mobs. And when it broke -- or opened wide as does a gatekeeper does when bribed -- order had collapsed into bouts of naked assault. Hippies and hard hats brawled each other out until they couldn't anymore, while a broad swathe of New York lay sacrificed as collateral damage. It took the city two hours to rein both in, but by then more than seventy people and untold millions in property damage had fallen victim to one of the worst riots since the Civil War.\n\nPresident [Root.GetLeader] is expected to make an announcement to ameliorate tensions lingering from the "Hard Hat Riot", though whether or not it can succeed in doing so remains to be seen."

 USA.culture.34.t:0 "At Folsom Prison"
 USA.culture.34.desc:0 "The airwaves were filled with cheers and applause from the inmates of Folsom Prison today as Johnny Cash's new live album, At Folsom Prison, hit the shelves. This album was recorded live at a concert Cash performed at Folsom State Prison in California. It's a runaway success; the album has sold out at record stores across the nation and "Folsom Prison Blues" has shot up to number 1 on Billboard's Top 40.\n\n Johnny Cash shed much of his former "outlaw" image after getting help for his amphetamine addiction in 1967, but he has not given up his compassion for incarcerated Americans and his advocacy for their rights. Cash had several meetings with former President Nixon in the early 60s about prison reform, and has expressed interest in meeting with President [GetPresidentLastName] as well. The album's lyrics reflect the harsh and alienating conditions of prison life and the yearning of prisoners to break free and return to their loved ones.\n\n This album may have reinvigorated Cash's previously ailing career, and Columbia Records has suggested that a future live album might be recorded at San Quentin State Prison. Whatever the future may hold for the Man in Black, this album has clearly captivated the hearts and minds of the nation for years to come."
