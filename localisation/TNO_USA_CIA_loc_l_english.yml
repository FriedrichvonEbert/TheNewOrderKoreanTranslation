 USA_CIA_IBR.3.desc:0 "In the world of secret services and intelligence gathering and protecting, there are strange alliances that cut across ideological bounds, where even the study of geopolitics can't fully explain why such things happen. In the past couple of weeks, one such abnormal arrangement between the Axencia Anti-Separatista and the American Central Intelligence Agency has taken shape, initiated by the Americans nonetheless!\n\nThey have provided vast amounts of intelligence that they have gathered regarding some of the most persistent and dangerous underground groups in Iberia, including the CNT-FAI and FSLP, including providing the locations of safe houses and weapons caches that they have gathered. This information, correlated with our own, is allowing the AAS to begin planning operations and raids to further cripple the separatists and socialist groups that would seek to destroy Iberia.\n\nOf course, the United States would never publicly acknowledge that they would sacrifice those "fighting for freedom" to authoritarian states, and Iberia would, of course, never recognize that they needed the help of Americans to root out dissent. But their support and intelligence is still greatly appreciated."

Inside, as we found out when the suitcase was opened a few hours later, was the result of American intelligence gathering operations on several groups that Iberia considers to be terrorist organizations.\n\nWe've cross referenced the info the CIA has provided us with what we already know, and we are absolutely certain that this is all true, and not like the deceptive measures the western powers were so effective with in the Second World War. Membership lists, weapons storage locations, safe houses, recruitment efforts and even fully detailed plans are now in our hands, which will make targeting and crushing the many organizations seeking to destroy Iberia much, much easier.\n\nWe would never admit to needing the help, but it's unquestioned that the CIA has much more advanced technology and resources at their disposal than anything that we could provide our own agencies. If they are going to give us this info and not use it to undermine our nation, that can only mean they want to establish firmer relations with us."

It's old, it's leaking... but it's a lifeline to the giant wall that separates Atlantic from Mediterranian.\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency has chartered the SS Awastara and filled it with steel, cement, machinery and tools, provided at below market values, to help with our never ending efforts to keep the Gibraltar Dam from collapsing, and maybe even to finally finish what the Germans had so haphazardly abandoned. There are many other ships similar profiles and materials that will soon be arriving in Iberia to help us.\n\nBut even more valuable to us is what the single passenger on the ship is carrying. His name isn't that important, and whatever name he gave the custom's officials would not be his real name. But the information he provides on microfilm, stashed in one of the crates of cigarettes he is "selling," has information regarding efforts of workers associated with the Gibraltar Dam and their secret, illegal union and organization activity. Soon the identified leaders would be whisked away, never to be seen again, and the efforts of the workers to undermine our society and the Dam will be removed."

 USA_CIA_SGR.1.t:0 "The Black Market Problem"
 USA_CIA_SGR.1.desc:0 "The black market is one of those things that every totalitarian society has. It allows items that are in short supply such as food or consumer goods to reach the hands of the needy for inflated prices. Thanks to the destruction from the Civil War and our incomplete reforms, the black market is stronger than ever. It may keep the ordinary citizen fed and clothed right now, so for now we have to tolerate the black market's existence for now since we are still trying to repair and reform the whole system.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can't keep an eye on it, and our agents in the police that are doing such have reported a disturbing trend lately. Along with fresh vegetables and unrationed meat, there is an increased amount of uncensored literature, pamphlets and assorted media that is being distributed by these underground capitalists, which they appear to be selling for rather low prices, or even slipping into otherwise innocuous packages. They are denouncing our reform efforts, calling into question Speer's beliefs, and other such hogwash, undermining their faith in the new National Socialist system.\n\nUnfortunately, there is little that we can do right now. The police will continue to monitor the situation, report any increase in discontent, and maybe bust a few of the more egregious black marketeers. But we have many more pressing issues to do."
 USA_CIA_SGR.1.a:0 "Just one of many concerns."
 
 USA_CIA_SGR.2.t:0 "The Black Market Headache"
 USA_CIA_SGR.2.desc:0 "The police reports are becoming increasingly disconcerting and worrying. Investigations into the black market that is keeping ordinary Germans fed and clothed, but also questioning National Socialism, is now uncovering something more drastic. A new batch of pamphlets and short books are appearing, calling out for drastic reforms to the Reich. Some include those that Speer's advisors and supporters have called for that a majority of the nation is at best lukewarm too. But some of the pamphlets are calling for such crazy ideas as free, multi-candidate elections and even reducing the Fuhrer's power!\n\nThere is no doubt that some foreign power is behind this, most likely the Americans with their silly ideas of democracy, or perhaps the Japanese or Italians trying to take advantage of our weakened state. However, the Reich is in little position to actually combat this growing tide of foreign backed destabilization, so all we can do is manage it, and hope our reform efforts will convince the ordinary Germans that we know what we are doing."
 USA_CIA_SGR.2.a:0 "The people will never believe this!"
 
 USA_CIA_SGR.3.t:0 "The Bolstered Opposition"
 USA_CIA_SGR.3.desc:0 "More reports reaching the Reichskanzlei have illustrated a disturbing trend. Across the Reich, many reformist groups have been hanging more posters and distributing leaflets calling on the Fuhrer to accelerate his efforts to overhaul the nation. Even more concerning is a variety of groups that advocate for the rights of slaves, for democracy, and even the demolishing of the whole National Socialist state. While most of these groups are small, disunited in aims, and spread over a vast area, they have all seen a massive boost in organizational activity and resources that seems rather sudden and surprising.\n\nUndoubtedly, this is the work of a foreign power, using their secret service to fund our opponents to undermine our power and strength. But despite our efforts, we haven't been able to trace the source of the funds and support they are receiving. After all, we still have a Reich to rebuild!\n\nWe can deal with some posters and pamphlets for now, but we will have to keep a close eye on the people, for if too many are swayed and misled, it could spell trouble."

 USA_CIA_SGR.4.t:0 "Public Accusations"
 USA_CIA_SGR.4.desc:0 "Just when the Reich has finally reached an even keel after the devastating Civil War and the subsequent aftermath, something new comes to rock the boat. Lately a large number of conservaitve voices in the Reich have had their names smeared or past secrets dredged to the surface by unknown perpetrators. Small town mayors, minor party officials, government bureaucrats, local military heros and many others have had a deluge of criminal charges thrown at them in unsubstantiated pamphlets and word of mouth.\n\nScandalous stories of corruption, charges of fraud, even accusations of murder, are running rampant through the populace. Even more concerning isn't the popular opinion, but those that these salacious rumors are targeting: lower level National Socialist functionaries that are at best wary of Speer's reforms, and at worse actively opposed to them. How many of these rumors and accusations are true is unknown: some most likely are, though many more will have been fabricated whole cloth, but will be difficult to disprove nevertheless.\n\nOn one hand, this can be helpful to get some reforms passed. If our reactionary opponents are so busy defending themselves in the court of public opinion, they won't have the time or energy to stop those that want to reform the Reich. On the other hand, the fact that we can't find the source of these rumors means we should be wary: our unseen allies of reform today can become our worst enemies tomorrow."
 USA_CIA_SGR.4.a:0 "They can't all be true, can they?"
 
 USA_CIA_SGR.5.t:0 "The Market for Reform"
 USA_CIA_SGR.5.desc:0 "The black market is a fact of daily life in the Reich, no matter how generous the rations or how many consumer goods are produced by good Germanic industries. Someone will always want a bit more meat on the plate, or some foreign made product that is superior in quality to those made within our empire. Even some of the highest ranking party members or military officers will get their hands on American cigarettes or Japanese electronics through these underground bazzars, so there is little incentive to root them out.\n\nBut with the smuggled luxuries and duplicate ration cards also comes something more sinister: verboten knowledge and ideas that would undermine our National Socialist state and efforts at reforming it. For weeks, undercover police officers have been reporting on a flood of pro-reformist literature and media, uncensored by the Propagandaministerium, advocating for policies and ideas that even the most strident Speerites would consider a step too far.\n\nLocal authorities and the Orpo have managed to crack down on the most destabilizing and blatant of these pro-reformist and destabilizing pamphlets and flyers, but it can only be a fraction of what is actually distributed. It's also been incredibly difficult to find out who is supplying these materials, but we are still investigating nonetheless."
 USA_CIA_SGR.5.a:0 "Good Germans would never fall for such nonsense!"
 
 USA_CIA_SGR.6.t:0 "Growing Opposition"
 USA_CIA_SGR.6.desc:0 "In the more liberal regime of Albert Speer, some things that would have been unthinkable just a few years before are now commonplace. Take for instance the daily student protests: all over the Reich, we've allowed some semblance of peaceful assembly since many of these young men and women are supporters of the Fuhrer, and the last thing he wants is to betray that trust. However, that doesn't mean plainclothes, undercover police officers can't investigate and infiltrate these movements, and their reports are increasingly worrying.\n\nSomehow, these disparate groups are receiving funds and resources that these students shouldn't have in their possession, which is allowing them to expand their efforts outside of university campuses and technical college classrooms. Even more disturbing is the reports that groups like the Reichsbanner are also receiving such resources, allowing these more radical groups to grow in strength.\n\nWhile we've been able to track, confiscate and seize some of the funds that investigators can prove are illegal, it's clear that some foreign power is putting a lot of time and energy in bolstering the pro-democracy and anti-National Socialist movements in Europe."
 USA_CIA_SGR.6.a:0 "They can complain in the streets now, what more do they want?"
 
 USA_CIA_SGR.7.t:0 "Reparation Chaos!"
 USA_CIA_SGR.7.desc:0 "A foreign stereotype of the German people is our penchant for efficiency and order, stretching back to the era of Frederick the Great and beyond. Of course, we know better than that: the National Socialist regime is riven with internal strife, corruption, overlapping responsibilities and red tape. While the Fuhrer has done his best to clean up the mess and reorganize the whole Reich's bureaucracy, it is an uphill struggle.\n\nEven in brand new structures like the Reich's slave reparation system, created from the ground up for a noble cause, there have been problems. But this one in particular has caught everyone's attention. A dozen civil servants in the reparation program have been accused of corruption, kickbacks and other measures, despite previously stellar records. Not only that, but a fire in three offices, set within a week of each other in Frankfurt, Essen and Rostock have destroyed thousands of files related to many slaves, casting them adrift into the byzantine system. The scandal and fire, along with many other misplaced papers and orders has cast a dark shadow over the whole program.\n\nIt's too suspicious and coordinated to be merely accidental or coincidental, but we have been unable to uncover any proof that there is such a plot to wreak havoc with our attempts to reform our economy."

 USA_CIA_SGR.8.t:0 "Accidents or Sabotage?"
 USA_CIA_SGR.8.desc:0 "For as long as the Reich has relied on unwilling slave labor to fuel its economy, there have been an incredibly high number of workplace fatalities and deliberate attempts to undermine the rhythms of productive work. This is to be expected, with so many poorly trained foreigners that are motivated simply by gunpoint slipping up or breaking down. That is just one of the many reasons why we are now trying to wind it down.\n\nOur efforts to end the slave system while also keeping our economy going has not been easy, and reports of an increasing number of breakdowns of vehicles and factories all over the eastern territories has raised concern that this isn't just lazy or incomptent slaves like usual. No, this has all the hallmarks of a full on partisan movement like what we faced in the west during the war... except for the fact that we don't have definitive proof of such a widespread and organized movement among the slaves. Twenty years ago, we had an inkling that it was the Yankees and Brits that were funding the resistance movements in France or the Low Countries, but now?\n\nWe've put into place more safety requirements and training, and the damage to locomotives and trucks and machinery can be repaired, but it will slow down our slave reparation efforts and make everything just that much more expensive in the long run."

Mayors, bureaucrats, policemen and others are being accused of all the regular things: criminal activities and political corruption, of course. But some are even blaming them for the whole Oil Crisis and the chaos in the east. The intelligence services believe that this is the work of a foreign power, but who they don't know.\n\nWe know very well that there are much more complicated reasons why our economy is crashing and the former slaves are rising up, but the average citizen doesn't, and some are taking this simple conspiracy theory to heart. However, many more see this as simple slander, and are rightly more focused on personal issues."

A few boasts here, some lies there, pictures, newsreels and films that stretch the truth, and you can convince the masses to believe anything.\n\nThe problem is that when everything starts going wrong, unofficial news and foreign propaganda can make headway despite all the censorship and the heavy handed police state. And lately, more unapproved posters on walls and pamphlets in the desks of lower level officials are appearing all over the Reich. They claim that our lacklustre reform efforts had resulted in this crisis: if only we had been more aggressive and willing to break even more, the Reich could have avoided the Oil Crisis and the increasing issues in the East.\n\nWe are positive that these are the efforts of outside nations, though we can't trace the source. We've also seen that most don't trust or believe these posters, since the average German was already hesitant about the necessity of reforms, since that meant they would have to accept that the propaganda they had been fed for thirty years was wrong, that the Reich wasn't perfect and great. But there is always some that are skeptical, and some that have actually asked the most dangerous question of all..."

 USA_CIA_SGR.11.t:0 "Reichsbanner Support"
 USA_CIA_SGR.11.desc:0 "As if the Oil Crisis wasn't enough of a problem, now the Reich is facing discontent bordering on rebellion in the Eastern territories where many of the repatriated slaves were sent to, all gathering under the Reichsbanner.\n\nLately our intelligence sources in the east have reported that known groups of supporters of this dangerous group have been receiving resources, supplies and funds from unknown sources. This is allowing for more recruitment and weapons training, as well as influence and support amongst the teeming masses all over the territories in the eastern part of the Reich. This is clearly the work of another country, because where else are they going to get guns and money? But, to the frustration of those charged with finding out who is undermining the Reich, the source of these resources are still shrouded in mystery.\n\nIt may not be a lot of extra recruits and former slaves rushing to the Reichsbanner, but anyone going to the radicals and anarchists is a problem that someday we will have to deal with."

 USA_CIA_BOR.1.desc:0 "It is better if the people do not know how the government is run. A sentiment famously expressed by the Chancellor of the Second Reich, it has become a guiding principle of the Third.\n\nIt is therefore unfortunate that a leaflet alleging multiple instances of the government supporting and exonerating criminals is making the rounds. The leaflet names several instances of the government intervening to stop criminal proceedings and stifle criminal investigations, and ties them to a list of prominent Bormannites from the Bürgerkrieg. Describing the crimes in great detail, the leaflet's author accuses our government of abetting rapists and thieves.\n\nThis should have never reached the public. It is only natural that our supporters expect support and protection in return, but exposing the inner workings of that exchange will only feed a sense of disillusionment among the general populace.\n\nWe have little choice but to direct more of our resources to suppression. It might slow down some of our other efforts, but the printers of this drivel will be found and shut down, and the distributors of the leaflets will be prosecuted for treason."

Our intelligence services suspect that one of our many rivals could have been behind this, due to the rather coincidental nature of so many issues happening at once. However, there is no hard evidence, and we can only speculate at who it is at the moment. And maybe it is just a coincidence, the result of trying to get the Grossraum moving as fast as possible, and the speculation is just paranoid minds seeing patterns where none exist.

While we are seeing improvements in nearly every sector of the economy, there has been an uptick in the number of incidents of human error or suspected sabotage: it's hard to separate the two.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult to reform the economy by getting rid of the slaves and replacing them with skilled German workers, while also maintaining and increasing the current level of production. But it's becoming increasingly harder to wave off these incidents as simply untrained and new workers getting used to their jobs.

But as the factories reduce their reliance on slaves, we need to get rid of the Untermenschen, sending them away to the east so they won't sully the Aryan race.\n\nBut lately many troubles have befallen the railways that would ship them away. Locomotives have been breaking down more rapidly, the destruction of water towers for our coal powered trains and the spoiling of diesel fuel for other trains with water. Not only that, but the overcrowded slave camps have seen increases in arson and vandalism, as well as protests and even riots that have strained the camp guards and require other police and military units to intervene. Sweeps of the camp have revealed illegal literature and propaganda, but we can't figure out who is trying to turn our slaves against us.\n\nWe can still get the slaves out of Germany proper, but it will be more expensive and take longer, as we may have to use trucks instead of trains or marching them through streets requiring armed guards.

Investigations are underway to determine the cause of the crash, but as of yet no definitive proof has been uncovered, either showing it was intentional sabotage or an accident.\n\nThis will greatly hamper our efforts to send more of the slaves back to the Reichskommisariats. We'd have to divert trains in other directions, costing time and money and hampering other important products and freight that needs to be moved around the Reich. But if we want the Grossraum project to be a success, we will have to power through, spend the extra resources and time to get the slaves out of Germany and to the eastern lands."

The fire quickly spread through the secure carriages, causing many slaves to either suffocate from smoke inhalation or else burn to death. The fire also damaged a station and several critical stretches of track, which will take weeks to fix. Worse, after news of the incident spread, many of the former slaves awaiting transfer eastwards began to riot, believing that the carnage was intentional on our part as a means of disposing of them.\n\nMany are by now practically screaming that this was a clear act of sabotage, but even after everything we are still drawing a blank on the real culprit. Fortunately, after all the recent chaos, senior management of the Grossraum project have met to draw up a comprehensive security plan that they assure us will put a stop to any security flaws.

No direct link to foreign agencies has been found, however.\n\nReformist circles and underground youth movements in particular have lapped up the illegal media like the lowlifes that they are, and many are attempting to distribute it to other citizens in the hopes of converting them to their degenerate way of thinking. We cannot risk the resurgence of reformism in this country, lest we end up with another crisis on our hands.

Some of the figures involved are so critical to the function of the bureaucracy that we have had to work overtime to bury their messes for them, but the rest have been removed and several have been arrested for their crimes against the German state.\n\nThere is no doubt that this will only further hurt the bureaucracy, and put more dents in the party machinery necessary to the dismantlement of our enemies. Some are beginning to suspect that the recent uncovering of these activities is in fact the work of subversive elements who are actively seeking to limit our ability to control the Reich.

When state police moved in to make arrests of those responsible, minor outbreaks of unrest triggered in response. Though these protests were soon quashed, the fact that they sprang up so rapidly as a result of our actions is a worrying sign.\n\nThe production value on some of the seized media leads us strongly to believe that our foreign rivals are responsible for at least some of this recent influx, though without proof we would be risking a diplomatic incident to openly accuse them of this. Efforts to squash black market activity and clamp down on subversiveness have been redoubled, and hopefully we can soon get this situation under control.

This is grossly unacceptable, of course, though we can't exactly send in armed police to storm the banks and arrest every key executive. Such a move would cause financial panic and cripple our already fragile economy.\n\nInstead, we will have to be more subtle. Letters have been sent out to the offending bankers politely asking them to end their little funding campaign, and threatening vague consequences should they refuse. We can resort to more heavy handed approaches should any keep up their treachery, but many have already affirmed their loyalty to the Reich and cut off any under-the-table deals. Unfortunately, the money that has already been sent out is still in the hands of our opponents, and the influx they did receive before we cut them off will certainly help them frustrate our efforts.\n\nCuriously enough, it seems some of the offending bankers have come clean, explaining that they had received money from unknown clients, with the agreement that they could keep a cut if they passed on the rest to the opposition.

While the sight of Americans was cheered on by many, and nobody will certainly be complaining about the influx of this material on our shores, there is something worrying people in the party.\n\nThe Americans only initially had success contacting the Bukharinites, and thus most if not all of the work involving this shipment came through and relied on them. Although certain Sablinite members of our government were informed and attempted to reach out to the delegates, no response was received despite the Bukharinites essentially having constant contact. Regardless, the Americans are clearly playing favorites for this aid, and many in the Bukharin wing of the party are celebrating. Members of their caucus shook hands with some of the delegates and workers arriving on the ships, creating an uneasy atmosphere among Sablin's cadre.\n\nOnly time will tell what becomes of this relationship and the aid received from it, but perhaps it may further exacerbate the rift between our great party's two wings."

The cities are full of demonstrators, Bukharinite posters adorn building walls and their fliers litter the hands of our citizens. Perhaps even more concerningly, several low-ranking bureaucratic members of our party have simply switched allegiances or jumped ship to fully support the supporters of Bukharin.\n\nAs far as we know, no major societal rift or change has been noticed by our government in order to cause such an increase in support. Despite several of our party wing's informants in bars, meeting halls, and demonstrations, they all come to the immediate observation that the support simply sprouted out of thin air. However, the attitude in our cabinet is more cynical. Given that both of our wings are roughly equal in raw power and resources, it is incredibly likely that an outside benefactor has been supporting the Bukharin wing directly. Even after an informant of ours managed to get hands on their financial records however, there is no succinct proof, and for the time being we cannot be sure of where their good fortune is coming from.

The clear superiority of mass-produced modern equipment over whatever scraps the local warlords can come up with would undoubtedly be a decisive factor in the upcoming conflicts, but Russia must be already overflowing with rifles and other assorted infantry equipment - would that marginal improvement really be worth it?\n\nAnother option would be sending a large quantity of motor vehicles. History proves that mobility is one of the most essential tools of warfare, with even Russia itself failing to counter the rapid advance of lightning-fast motorized forces. American vehicles could be spearheading a rapid push to encircle large enemy formations, but they could also be misused in front assaults against well-entrenched enemies. Could the Russian commanders be trusted to properly use these powerful tools?\n\nLastly, John thought of going as far as to send them helicopters and jets.

Alexander Yakovlev's support has risen to even more notable levels recently. Yakovlev is enjoying a surge of endorsements from party members, has posters of him adorning city squares, and has received seemingly nothing but positive media coverage.\n\nWhile this normally would not be a problem, rumors have been speculating among Zhukov's inner circle as to why this surge has occurred. Some point to Yakovlev's internationalist beliefs which may attract foreign supporters. Others suspect that Yakovlev has been scheming within the government to gain favors, while the most extreme and paranoid claim that he is a reactionary working with major powers to subvert our revolution. Whatever the case is, it is without a doubt present that a majority of the public now supports Yakovlev taking the place of the Marshal, and, perhaps, Zhukov himself has something else to consider during his appointment."

It wasn't just the newspapers, either; scholarly and political papers poured out of the universities, and they all said the same thing: the SLP reformation was on the right track.\n\nA half hour later she arrived at a soaring office building. Her appointment was a lowly, prematurely-balding young clerk. The placard on the desk read WILBUR LOWRY. The bespectacled man looked up as she entered. "Morning, Ms. Coster," he said. "On time as usual." "And bearing gifts," said Nadine, taking a file folder out of her briefcase and setting it before Lowry. Lowry opened the folder and scanned the pages, face as placid as a still lake. "Everything seems to be above board." He looked up at her. "You've had a good run of donations lately." That was an understatement. Nadine thought about the man she'd met: the gentleman with the horn-rim glasses who'd come to the November rally. "We have a generous benefactor," she said. "Very generous, by the looks of this," Lowry said of the folder. Was that suspicion in his eyes? Nadine wanted to move away from such talk. As free as the Gentleman had been with his money, she had the feeling it would be better if Mr. Lowry remained ignorant of him a while longer. "I have another meeting soon." Nadine reached out a hand. "Is there anything else?" Lowry placed the folder in her hand. "No, ma'am. Between you and I, my superior is much happier to deal with you than Brooks." Nadine smiled and replaced the folder. "Here's to a fruitful future for us all."

The details of the crime are as follows: that these men knowingly, without undue pressure or coercion, accepted bribes from persons known to be affiliated with the German State. Matthew Whelan, Horace Fuller, Frederick Price, Harold St. John, and Lewis Weaver were strong advocates of a reconstruction effort that would rebuild a portion of London's sewer system that collapsed during the war. During a session in Parliament last month, they abruptly changed their votes and reclassified the motion as a waste of time and resources. Later, London Police were approached by an individual (whose name has not been disclosed to the BBC) who informed them that these MPs had taken a bribe from an agent of Germany enticing them to prevent the reconstruction effort from succeeding. The informant provided photographic evidence of several meetings between the MPs in question and a party MI5 has identified as a known espionage agent. An arraignment date has not yet been set, and it is not expected the MPs will be tried individually. The BBC made an attempt to interview the informant who broke the story but MI5, we are told, has lost track of this person. While the information this informant provided has been verified, questions are now being raised as to whether the informant themselves might be an agent of a foreign power.\n\nIn any case, the quick ousting of the corrupt MPs has garnered a wave of support for the government, bolstered further by the fact that investigations into a number of other Members of Parliament have been announced."
