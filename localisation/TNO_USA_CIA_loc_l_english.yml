On the other hand, the rumors about his colleague Salazar and his stumbles and failures have come to light, damaging his standing among the populace.\n\nIt seems rather strange, and too convenient for Franco to receive a sudden boost in support, and Salazar the simultaneous diminishing of his popularity, especially since both have taken great pains to be seen as equals in the past.

On the other hand, the rumors about his colleague Franco and his stumbles and failures have come to light, damaging his standing among the populace.\n\nIt seems rather strange, and too convenient for Salazar to receive a sudden boost in support, and Franco the simultaneous diminishing of his popularity, especially since both have taken great pains to be seen as equals in the past.

It may keep the ordinary citizen fed and clothed right now, so for now we have to tolerate the black market's existence for now since we are still trying to repair and reform the whole system.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can't keep an eye on it, and our agents in the police that are doing such have reported a disturbing trend lately. Along with fresh vegetables and unrationed meat, there is an increased amount of uncensored literature, pamphlets and assorted media that is being distributed by these underground capitalists, which they appear to be selling for rather low prices, or even slipping into otherwise innocuous packages. They are denouncing our reform efforts, calling into question Speer's beliefs, and other such hogwash, undermining their faith in the new National Socialist system.\n\nUnfortunately, there is little that we can do right now.

For weeks, undercover police officers have been reporting on a flood of pro-reformist literature and media, uncensored by the Propagandaministerium, advocating for policies and ideas that even the most strident Speerites would consider a step too far.\n\nLocal authorities and the Orpo have managed to crack down on the most destabilizing and blatant of these pro-reformist and destabilizing pamphlets and flyers, but it can only be a fraction of what is actually distributed.

A dozen civil servants in the reparation program have been accused of corruption, kickbacks and other measures, despite previously stellar records.

That is just one of the many reasons why we are now trying to wind it down.\n\nOur efforts to end the slave system while also keeping our economy going has not been easy, and reports of an increasing number of breakdowns of vehicles and factories all over the eastern territories has raised concern that this isn't just lazy or incomptent slaves like usual. No, this has all the hallmarks of a full on partisan movement like what we faced in the west during the war... except for the fact that we don't have definitive proof of such a widespread and organized movement among the slaves.

As our attempts to dismantle our opposition have worn on, it seems that the cash flow from the treacherous bankers has only increased, in what is certainly an effort to subvert our attempts to secure control. This is grossly unacceptable, of course, though we can't exactly send in armed police to storm the banks and arrest every key executive. Such a move would cause financial panic and cripple our already fragile economy.\n\nInstead, we will have to be more subtle. Letters have been sent out to the offending bankers politely asking them to end their little funding campaign, and threatening vague consequences should they refuse. We can resort to more heavy handed approaches should any keep up their treachery, but many have already affirmed their loyalty to the Reich and cut off any under-the-table deals. Unfortunately, the money that has already been sent out is still in the hands of our opponents, and the influx they did receive before we cut them off will certainly help them frustrate our efforts.\n\nCuriously enough, it seems some of the offending bankers have come clean, explaining that they had received money from unknown clients, with the agreement that they could keep a cut if they passed on the rest to the opposition. Who exactly is doing this is currently unclear."

 USA_CIA_RUS.1.desc:0 "A week ago, several delegates from America contacted several members of our government to invest into Magadan proper and its Port on top of discreetly shoveling us some industrial aid. This morning, several ships arrived on our shores, carrying literal boatloads of raw industrial equipment, raw materials, and generic supplies. While the sight of Americans was cheered on by many, and nobody will certainly be complaining about the influx of this material on our shores, there is something worrying people in the party.\n\nThe Americans only initially had success contacting the Bukharinites, and thus most if not all of the work involving this shipment came through and relied on them. Although certain Sablinite members of our government were informed and attempted to reach out to the delegates, no response was received despite the Bukharinites essentially having constant contact. Regardless, the Americans are clearly playing favorites for this aid, and many in the Bukharin wing of the party are celebrating. Members of their caucus shook hands with some of the delegates and workers arriving on the ships, creating an uneasy atmosphere among Sablin's cadre.\n\nOnly time will tell what becomes of this relationship and the aid received from it, but perhaps it may further exacerbate the rift between our great party's two wings."

The cities are full of demonstrators, Bukharinite posters adorn building walls and their fliers litter the hands of our citizens. Perhaps even more concerningly, several low-ranking bureaucratic members of our party have simply switched allegiances or jumped ship to fully support the supporters of Bukharin.\n\nAs far as we know, no major societal rift or change has been noticed by our government in order to cause such an increase in support. Despite several of our party wing's informants in bars, meeting halls, and demonstrations, they all come to the immediate observation that the support simply sprouted out of thin air. However, the attitude in our cabinet is more cynical. Given that both of our wings are roughly equal in raw power and resources, it is incredibly likely that an outside benefactor has been supporting the Bukharin wing directly. Even after an informant of ours managed to get hands on their financial records however, there is no succinct proof, and for the time being we cannot be sure of where their good fortune is coming from.

To a limited extent, we are also intercepting communications from the Indonesian armed forces, courtesy of military ciphers broken by the Americans.\n\nThese benefits will not last forever - the Indonesian regime is sure to adopt new military secrecy codes and improve their own operational security against American espionage. But for now, we need any advantage we can get."

Networks of informants, in place for decades, suddenly going dark. A sharp increase in combat deaths of our junior officers, leaving the men without leadership at this most critical time.\n\nSome of this was expected, of course; Hatta's men have clearly been planning their rebellion for a long while, long enough to escape substantial detection - and long enough to prepare to disrupt our activities. But the scope of the interference hKas far exceeded what we thought reasonably achievable for a group of limited resources. Far from being isolated to the areas of strongest known rebel sympathies, the disruptions are occurring even in our most stalwart centers of support.\n\nEven without concrete proof, the culprit is abundantly clear - the United States and their Central Intelligence Agency, operating out of Australia and in the myriad islands of the Indonesian archipelago, must be aiding Hatta's rebels and sapping our ability to fight back. And they have done their work, for it will take months to recover what has been lost."

Even as our men on the lines need as much ammunition and supplies as we can send them from Jakarta, the infrastructure needed to transport critical goods continues to be sabotaged at an alarming rate.\n\nWhile we expected some degree of partisan activity and sabotage, the ability of Hatta's rebels to penetrate deep into our interior and the breadth of their attacks almost certainly indicates outside help. Whether it be by forward observers or by clandestine airstrikes, the Americans and their intelligence operatives are clearly trying to tip the scales of the war in the rebels' favor.\n\nSadly, given our stretched resources and the pressing need to prevent a wider intervention in our war, we have limited options to retaliate directly against the Americans. We will simply have to rebuild what was destroyed, and hope that it won't be destroyed again."

 USA_CIA_UK.1.t:0 "OPERATION STATEROOM: REPORT A2D4Y6"
 USA_CIA_UK.1.desc: "After defeating the German collaborators in a prolonged civil war, Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance (HMMLR) has re established democracy in the state of England, and in the first free and open election, the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) won the greatest amount of parliamentary seats. They are now the sole governing party. A nominally communist party, the SLP was led during its underground period by Spanish Civil War veteran Bill Alexander, though he has since retired from politics. The current party leader is Harold Wilson, head of the SLP's reformist wing. Our contact PHOENIX has reported that Wilson is rivaled by Reginald Birch in the SLP's internal politics, representing the party's bolshevik faction.\n\nAgents in the country have noted the precarious nature of SLP unity, as Wilson works tirelessly to deny Birch's faction power and transform the party into one of social democracy and left-socialism.\n\nBoth Wilson and Birch have expressed positive sentiments towards the Organization of Free Nations and an alliance with the United States, but should Birch win out against Wilson, one of his successors could adopt a radically anti-American stance. Maintaining operations in this New England is paramount if the Agency wishes to be successful."

 USA_CIA_UK.2.t:0 "OPERATION STATEROOM: REPORT A2D4Y7"
 USA_CIA_UK.2.desc:0 "George Jellicoe of the National Democratic League has been appointed Prime Minister following recent elections, firmly aligning England with our international security interests.\n\nFounded by Claude Auchinleck following HMMLR's victory, the main purpose of this party was to restore Elizabeth II to the throne and, by extension, restore pre-war British society. The core of this party is Jellicoe and his Democrats, a moderate faction with ties to the old aristocracy that supports the complete integration of England into OFN infrastructure. He is the linchpin holding the parties two other factions in the team.\n\nThe second wing of this party is Norman St John-Stevas's New Whigs. He supports deeper social reforms, particularly regarding women and homosexuals, as well as a more business-oriented economy. He believes in downsizing the British army and, while nominally pro-OFN, he wants Britain to play only a minor role within it. He is opposed by Enoch Powell's Patriot wing. Powell wants to maintain English independance in foreign affairs, albeit recognising the necessity of OFN membership. His party also supports such a strongly reactionary line on social issues that the Agency was surprised he joined HMMLR at all. Animosity between these two factions greater than between either and the Democrats. Jellicoe is thus able to use his moderate position to strengthen party unity.\n\nThis is obviously a great success for American interests in Europe. As long as Jellicoe stays in charge of the party and the nation, OFN dominance of English military and security infrastructure is guaranteed. Agency advises continued support for the NDL, overtly and covertly, as long as his Conservatives hold the balance of power."

 USA_CIA_UK.3.t:0 "OPERATION STATEROOM: REPORT A2D4Y8"
 USA_CIA_UK.3.desc:0 "Situation in England has turned positive. Despite HMMLR's defeat, the former-collaborationist regime has broken ties with Germany to align with the OFN. The Maudling government of the United England Party, one of the splinter factions from the original collaborationist Royal Party, has taken power and pursued OFN membership.\n\nDespite Reginald Maudling being the nominal Prime Minister, analysts report that real power is held by Harold Macmillan, previously a reform-advocate in the Royal Party. His shadow leadership makes ascertaining England's new direction difficult. Although he was known for his pro-democracy leanings before the war, it is still unclear why he opposed HMMLR during the conflict. Nonetheless, our analysts believe that he still favors increased democratic reform in England, and further believe that a Pro-OFN faction within his party, possibly led by the liberal minister Selwyn Lloyd, has won Macmillan's favor. This is likely the cause of their new international alignment.\n\nConcern has been raised about the security risks involved in accepting England as an ally, given militarist Anthony Kershaw's position in the Cabinet. Kershaw has not been deemed openly hostile to OFN interests, but he has been ascertained to be a loyalty-risk. He has no inherent objection to remaining in the Pakt except that it forces England into a subservient position, something which might not be the case under a reformist leaning Reich. He and his faction seem to prioritize combatting Thatcher's Royal Party and Chesterton's National Front over staying out of the OFN, but he cannot be counted on as a permanent US ally. Ultimately, Kershaw is loyal to Macmillan above all else, and we cannot know Macmillan's outlook with certainty.\n\nAnalysts recommend acceptance of England in the OFN, but urge caution. Macmillan's government has served our interests, but his party's loyalty cannot be guaranteed. Close monitoring of English political developments will be necessary, particularly in the event of Maudling usurping control of the party from Macmillan, but England could still prove a valuable asset to the OFN."

 USA_CIA_UK.4.t:0 "OPERATION STATEROOM: REPORT A2D4Y9"
 USA_CIA_UK.4.desc:0 "Government victory in the civil war has not clarified international alignment of England. The Royal Party remains in power, albeit under new leadership following Alec Douglas-Home's resignation. Margaret Thatcher has become Prime Minister, and is apparently seeking membership in the OFN.\n\nThatcher is an unknown variable. We cannot ascertain for certain whether she is a puppet for the party's old-guard like Rab Butler, or whether she is genuinely in control of the country. She appears to support increasing Britain's strength on the world stage but we are uncertain of her position on political and economic reform. Moreover, her focus on improving British military power is worrying. Despite her apparent pro-OFN turn, we are uncertain of her personal support for American interests. We cannot guarantee that anti-American party leaders such as Keith Joseph will not usurp her authority, nor can we guarantee that she will remain an ally of the United States in the future.\n\nOur analysts are unanimous that CIA operations in England should not commence until Thatcher has formally joined the OFN through a binding treaty. The Agency would neither wish to hinder a future friend nor aid a future enemy, and until Thatcher's political allegiance is made law it would be inadvisable to covertly aid or attack her regime. Agency recommends letting the State Department handle all interactions with England until then."

But they never did. As strange as it was... everyone was enjoying themselves.\n\nMilitary officers toasted members of parliament, Colonels twirled the wives of their civilian counterparts on the dance floor, and a Lieutenant had even shared a duck leg with Lowry ten minutes ago. Portraits of concord if ever there were.\n\nLowry looked down the length of the table to a certain well-known General in deep discussion with an MP. Here was the only inkling that something was off: the General's smile was a little too stiff, a little too forced. Lowry squeezed the arms of his chair and cast about the room. He spotted the Gentleman -- a well-dressed chap sporting horn-rim glasses -- standing in a corner, watching the General hawkishly. Lowry was perhaps the only one who'd seen this Gent slip the General a scrap of paper a month ago at a conference following the war. It had been a chance sighting; he'd just happened to look over and see the strange Gent slide the note to the General under the table. And now, the General was laughing with a civilian MP.\n\nLowry wasn't about to say anything, though. If he did he'd be reshuffled out of his cozy office job into oblivion. No guv, he'd worked hard to maintain his position and he'd be damned if he lost it to some under-the-table paper shuffling. And anyway, the spotted dick was really rather excellent..."

Standish claimed he has never believed in the reconstruction efforts currently in progress but was ambivalent towards notion of overthrowing government. Made it perfectly clear to Standish that he'll have full support in his obstruction of the government and eventual overthrow. Standish agreed shortly thereafter.\n\nOver following week, I was introduced to several officers who feel as Standish does. All are willing to join in, provided our support is concrete and of the material variety. I formally request a demonstration of our support in the form of *REDACTED* to be shipped to Liverpool on the *REDACTED* day of next month.

The Lieutenant seated beside the Colonel on the other side of Lowry's desk kept looking anxiously between Lowry and his commanding officer. Strange... Lowry had never met this young man before. He looked to be Lowry's own age. Standish closed the file and threw it down on Lowry's desk. "No," he said. Lowry frowned. "Colonel," said the clerk, "this project would be a minimal strain on your manpower and provide clean water to a thousand--" "No."\n\nThe Lieutenant looked shocked at his CO's answer. "Sir," he said, "surely we can--" "It is incumbent upon bureaucrats like these--" Standish nodded to Lowry, "to go swimming in the muck and make sure the sewers work. I won't have our men sullied by a job like that." The Lieutenant scoffed and turned to Lowry. "I'll organize something," he said, "get some boys together." "You'll do no such thing, Davis," Standish said, rising from his chair. "If I hear you attempting anything of the sort, I'll send you straight back to boot camp." Standish glared at Lowry. "Leave the shit to the flies." With that, he turned on his heel and left the room. The Lieutenant stayed behind, a troubled look on his face. "Mr. Lowry," he said, whispering quickly, "I'm sorry this meeting wasn't more productive. Standish has been behaving strangely since his meeting at the American embassy last month. I think a word with the intelligence boys is in order. Could you arrange that?" Lowry made a noncommittal noise. The Lieutenant sighed. "Thank you, sir." He jogged from the office after his CO.

Coster had the support of several prominent trade unions, and this excision from the body politic of the SLP would weaken the party. We'll be scratching our heads about this till next Christmas, he thought.

A week ago, the newspapers wouldn't dare touch a story like that; now the SLP was inundated in ink. It wasn't just the newspapers, either; scholarly and political papers poured out of the universities, and they all said the same thing: the SLP reformation was on the right track.\n\nA half hour later she arrived at a soaring office building.

Lowry opened the folder and scanned the pages, face as placid as a still lake. "Everything seems to be above board." He looked up at her. "You've had a good run of donations lately." That was an understatement. Nadine thought about the man she'd met: the gentleman with the horn-rim glasses who'd come to the November rally. "We have a generous benefactor," she said. "Very generous, by the looks of this," Lowry said of the folder. Was that suspicion in his eyes? Nadine wanted to move away from such talk.

The lad finished pasting the poster to the brick and moved on down the street.\n\n"Well," said Seale, "since someone is going to have to take the credit, I suppose the Patriots deserve a win."\n\n"Not a chance, Seale," Cosburn said. "The New Whigs have gone too long without some respectable promotion. This one's ours."\n\nSeale scratched his chin. "Well, then... I suppose it's down to who can make it back to Westminster first." He started walking up the street and Cosburn fell into step next to him. With each step, they picked up the pace, until both men were sprinting past the startled Englishmen and -women who were out that day... as well as a certain well-groomed Gentleman in horn-rim glasses, off to pay the poster lad for such excellent work."

 USA_CIA_UK.41.desc:0 "BBC--BREAKING NEWS At 11:57 this morning, agents of MI5, in cooperation with the London Metropolitan Police, arrested five Members of Parliament and charged them with corruption. The details of the crime are as follows: that these men knowingly, without undue pressure or coercion, accepted bribes from persons known to be affiliated with the German State. Matthew Whelan, Horace Fuller, Frederick Price, Harold St. John, and Lewis Weaver were strong advocates of a reconstruction effort that would rebuild a portion of London's sewer system that collapsed during the war. During a session in Parliament last month, they abruptly changed their votes and reclassified the motion as a waste of time and resources. Later, London Police were approached by an individual (whose name has not been disclosed to the BBC) who informed them that these MPs had taken a bribe from an agent of Germany enticing them to prevent the reconstruction effort from succeeding. The informant provided photographic evidence of several meetings between the MPs in question and a party MI5 has identified as a known espionage agent. An arraignment date has not yet been set, and it is not expected the MPs will be tried individually. The BBC made an attempt to interview the informant who broke the story but MI5, we are told, has lost track of this person. While the information this informant provided has been verified, questions are now being raised as to whether the informant themselves might be an agent of a foreign power.\n\nIn any case, the quick ousting of the corrupt MPs has garnered a wave of support for the government, bolstered further by the fact that investigations into a number of other Members of Parliament have been announced."

He heard them and it invigorated him. He rose to his feet as Macmillan finished speaking and returned fire: "We should need no further proof," he bellowed, "of the sorry state we're in than the articles, periodicals, and posters that have proliferated in Britain this past fortnight. The Americans have the solution to our deficit of goods! You would put guns in the hands of our people but not a bottle of Coca-Cola?"\n\nMacmillan re-entered the fray. "Guns make our people a free and independent state. Coca-Cola makes us a pawn of the OFN!"\n\nMaudling had to wait for the applause to die down before he replied. "I want," he said, "Britons everywhere to be able to afford a toaster, a radio, and a car that isn't three decades out of production! Who in this room will risk roasting a chicken in their own oven these days?" Dark laughter rippled throughout the House; the gas valves on most kitchen ovens were in notoriously poor states. "This media blitz," Macmillan interrupted, "is so clearly an American geopolitical tactic that a blind man couldn't fail to see it." Maudling was troubled by that; there'd been many whispers that the source of this pro-free trade propaganda was not, as most people believed, University students, but American economists and intelligence agents. All the same, it was a tool Maudling could use to bring affordable consumer goods into the country. It was also a weapon he could turn against Macmillan. Smiling, he retorted: "If that's the case, I think we should congratulate the Yanks; they finally engineered their way around your substantial ego, Macmillan." The House erupted into cheers, and all of it for Maudling."

 USA_CIA_UK.45.desc:0 "Ian Dejardin, Co-Curator of Dulwich Picture Gallery, had never worked on a more audacious exhibit. Not because of the works featured, but because of what they were featured alongside. Andy Warhol, a name synonymous with experimentation and avant garde work, had been placed right next to some of the greatest German realists of the day, and he'd made the Germans look like indoctrinated progandist dullards. Londoners circulated throughout the exhibit, talking in hushed voices. "Why can't we see more like Warhol?" they asked. "What makes the realists so special?" Ian hid a smile. The moments when art patrons questioned the prevailing ideas of the day were the best moments of his career.\n\nHe wasn't entirely sure where the money had come from to transport Warhol and his work to London--rumours of a benefactor with a dark suit, well-groomed hair, and horn-rim glasses circulated among the Gallery accountants--nor did he particularly care. Warhol had struck like a meteorite, lighting England aflame with his weird, unique style. Even Downing Street had taken the time to recognize what Warhol was doing for free speech in the Isles.\n\nAnd as for the man himself? Well... he obviously wasn't the same since the attempt on his life. Ian couldn't imagine how terrifying that must have been for Andy. The bullet wound Valerie Solanas gave Warhol may have healed, but Warhol would forever be a wounded man; jumpy, looking around corners. Whatever his mental state, his art never failed to elicit a reaction from those who beheld, and right now, among Englishmen everywhere, the reaction took the form of a question, and it was one which applied to both art and government: "Where's our voice?""

Beside her, her husband Denis did the same, albeit awkwardly as he was holding a tumbler of whiskey. "Is this enough to change your mind about accepting their offer, darling?" he asked Margaret.\n\nThatcher chuckled and shook her head. "Not a chance." The motley Chicagoans, despite their antics, were really a keen-minded crew who'd helped shape America's economic policy. Now, pockets bursting, they'd crossed the oceans and offered their money and support to Thatcher. Their reason: they sought a more stable England for doing business with and believed Thatcher could deliver it. On the surface, there were no snags, but at this party hosted at Margaret's estate, the Iron Lady happened to notice the Chicagoans were not quite as drunk as they appeared.\n\nIf this was a performance intended to put her off her guard, it was well-done, but Thatcher was never off her guard.
