 POLITICS_VLADA_ZECEVIC_DESC:0 "Vladimir Zečević, better known as Father Vlada, is a man who has been many things. After joining the clergy, he served as a parish priest in a small town among the hills and woodlands of western Serbia, living a simple and pious life. It was only when the winds of war swept over the Balkans that Zečević left his church and flock to join the Chetnik resistance against the Germans. Despite rapidly rising through the ranks of the Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, he quickly grew outraged with Mihailović's policy of collaborating with the Nazi invader against Tito's communists, defecting to the partisans with five hundred of his men in 1942.\n\nHis newfound communist loyalty not at odds with his faith, Vlada simply pinned a red star under the cross on his cap, and continued to fight. Despite increasingly desperate odds, the partisans resisted in face of the invaders long after the end of the war, striking at the Nazis and their collaborators before disappearing again into the forests and mountains of the Serbian heartland. And throughout all those years, Vlada was always there, in the midst of the action, inspiring his comrades with his sermons and his deeds.\n\nAs tensions rose between Rome and Germania, the Serbian-Croatian border became heavily militarized on both sides, de facto cutting off Serbia's partisans from Tito's headquarters. Rapidly, ASNOS descended into political squabbling, and soon enough Vlada ended up in command of the armed wing of the liberation movement, as he was largely detached from such political struggles. Now, after so many years, the NOV has decided to launch its final, all out assault - but it is yet to be seen if Serbia will finally be liberated, and if Father Vlada will be allowed to return to his parish for one last time, resuming the simple life of a pious priest he was forced to abandon so long ago."
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDAR_RANKOVIC_DESC:0 "Sometimes known by his nom de guerre, Leka, Aleksandar Ranković is the foremost member of the partisan old guard in Serbia, and for many, one of the few remaining symbols of the Yugoslav dream. Born into a poor family in the outskirts of Belgrade, Ranković joined the Serbian workers' movement at the age of 15, soon entering the Serbian Communist Party. A dedicated and indefatigable organizer, Ranković was arrested and imprisoned for six years by the authorities of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and upon being released immediately resumed his political activity, playing a vital role in the early strengthening of the Party in Serbia.\n\nNot even the war was able to stop him - immediately joining the partisan movement as Serbia was invaded by Germany, he was again arrested in 1941, but this time by the Gestapo. Surviving torture at the hands of the Nazi criminals, he was rescued by a daring partisan raid. In retaliation, Gestapo agents executed his wife and his mother. Ever more determined to fight on, Ranković would later go on to become a major leader in the communist leadership, founding and directing OZNA, the partisans' secret police and intelligence bureau.\n\nIn his role as president of ASNOS, Ranković was entrusted with keeping the flame of Yugoslav communism alive. An entire generation of Serbians grew up barely remembering Tito and his comrades, but Ranković was there to remind them - to remind them that through the people's struggle, a new Yugoslavia would be reborn from its ashes. As the red star has once more risen in the skies of Belgrade, a new light shines in the Balkans - destined to either lead the Serbs to the liberation of all Yugoslav peoples, or to be once more stamped out by the vile servants of fascism."
 POLITICS_BORISAV_JOVIC_DESC:0 "In many ways, the life and rise to power of Borisav Jović is a mystery even to his supporters. Born in a small village in central Serbia to unknown parents, the details of his early life are barely known - however, young Jović studied economics in the University of Belgrade before joining the partisan movement. Distinguishing himself as a silent yet talented and ambitious organizer, Jović quietly and swiftly climbed the ranks of the liberation movement, managing the unofficial contact channels between the Serbian partisans and Italian agents in the Balkans, exchanging intel, and, according to some rumours, obtaining covert support from Rome.\n\nOrganizing the economic structure of ASNOS, Jović had already established a solid network of friends and supporters in the movement when he made his first public power plays. His outspoken Serbian patriotism and criticism of the partisan leadership quickly gained him sympathies among younger partisans, increasingly disaffected with their elders' Titoist and pan-Yugoslav rhetoric. After staying in the sidelines during the uprising that finally liberated Serbia, Jović only needed to give an order - without needing to lift a finger, he had almost the entire leadership of ASNOS arrested by his loyalists.\n\nRallying his supporters under the newly formed Socialist Party of Serbia, Jović won the first elections of free Serbia with barely any competition to oppose his widespread popularity. Using vaguely leftist and heavily nationalistic rhetoric, Jović paints the image of a reborn Serbia, one once again ready to become the lynchpin of the Balkans. While his detractors call him a populist quasi-dictator, his many supporters proudly rally around the red-blue-white flag that now waves free over Serbia - but many wonder if Jović's new Serbia is destined to be truly free."
 POLITICS_NIKOLA_KAVAJA_DESC:0 "Patriot, criminal, freedom fighter, bandit, rebel, terrorist. Nikola Kavaja is a man whose name is whispered with terror in all of Serbia, by his allies, his enemies, and his victims. Born in 1932, Kavaja witnessed as a child the deportation of his family by the invading Nazis - and then he killed for the first time, pushing a wounded German soldier into a well. As he grew up, his hatred for the occupiers grew with him, as did his fierce nationalism - and soon enough, Kavaja gathered around himself a disparate group of Chetnik remnants, disgraced collaborators, and common criminals, founding the Serbian Homeland Liberation Movement, or SOPO.\n\nAssassinations, kidnappings, sabotages, hijackings, bank robberies and bombings - with every action, SOPO grew more feared. Modeled after the Black Hand, SOPO compensated its relatively small numbers by mastering the arts of terror and brutality, striking Nazis when and where they least expected it. Even the partisans soon learned to fear Kavaja and his ferociously anti-communist gang - and yet, even when the two groups agreed to a truce before the offensive against the German garrison, nobody could expect what would come next.\n\nAfter quickly and brutally seizing power in Belgrade, Kavaja and SOPO took control of the whole of Serbia, violently crushing any form of resistance. Proclaiming the restoration of the Serbian kingdom, Kavaja and his men are now de facto in control of a new Serbia, their virulently nationalist propaganda being welcomed by the long downtrodden Serbs. And yet, the struggle for Serbian liberation is not yet over - and Kavaja is ready to ensure that no communist nor German invader dares ever again to try and usurp the throne of Nemanja, whatever the costs."

This state of affairs has left precious little economic wealth for the Serbs, and Germany seems to be in no hurry to alleviate our burdens."

The Garrison forbids us from expanding or properly training our military, to ensure that resisting their might will never be an option. Additionally, we are forced to pay for every single of the Garrisons expenses, as thanks for them "protecting" our borders."

Firstly there are the Yugoslavian communist partisans which, despite our best efforts,  have continued to resist our rule for decades. Lead by their commander Aleksandar Rankovi, hey seem to strike with impunity, attacking our patrols and garrisons, awaiting their next chance for a large scale uprising. If Serbia is ever to be a peaceful nation, theses bandits must be dealt with.\n\nNext, there are The Chetniks, which are a Serbian royalist group that ostensibly aims to topple our government and reinstate the monarchy. In practice, the Chetniks are a disorganized and decentralized group, and large sections of their ranks are content with tacitly cooperating with our government. But they do still present a looming threat, and were they ever to strike they could most likely cause a large amount of damage before being stopped."

Violently persecuted by the genocidal Ustaše or driven out by the Albanization programs in Italian-occupied Kosovo, massive waves of Serbs moved into the country as refugees - often still living in makeshift camps or in impoverished slums, they're a constant drain on our economy, and a source of recruits for partisan armies."

 SER_The_Occupation_Regime_desc:0 "Created by the Nazi occupational authorities in the middle of World War II, the Government of National Salvation or VNS is a mere facade for German control of Serbia.

As the Wehrmacht was forced to concentrate its limited resources in the strategically important Banat and in Belgrade, much of the country's interior, as soon as one steps away from major roads and cities, is controlled by partisans.

 SER_SOPO_Terrorism:0 "SOPO Terrorism"
 SER_SOPO_Terrorism_desc:0 "A shadowy terrorist organization, SOPO is made up of hardline Serbian nationalists, monarchists and former Chetniks, united by their hatred of the Nazis. While also opposed to the leftist NOV, SOPO have agreed to a truce with the partisans for the duration of the uprising - their terror tactics have proved very useful against the German troops, but their rising influence and power might prove dangerous down the line."
 SER_Generational_Divide:0 "Generational Divide"
 SER_Generational_Divide_desc:0 "Under the banners of the NOV, two generations fight together. One is the partisan old guard, loyal to Tito's pan-Yugoslav and communist vision for Serbia - the other is the younger wave of Serb recruits, who grew up during the war and barely remember a unified Yugoslavia. The younger partisans often don't share their elders' commitment to Tito or to Yugoslavia, instead espousing Serbian national sentiment and shunning communist doctrine - as their influence in the movement rapidly rises, it's hard to predict what the future of the partisan movement will be."

 SER_find_their_leaders_desc:0 "Serbia is making great strides to perish the thought of the Monarchy having fallen and being deposed, rounding up loose and disorganized Chetnik forces. Although the Germans view it as another rebellion quelled before the flames of a rebellion were ignited, we see it as purging Serbia of it's enemies and ensuring that our nation's national security is no longer threatened. Following various interrogations of Chetnik forces captured by Serbian Garrisons and the German Garrison alike, we've discovered promising information regarding the suspected locations of the Chetnik organization's leaders. We shall move to these locations and find their leaders, putting an end to their antics once and for all."

 SER_a_stab_in_the_back_desc:0 "Several groups of Chetniks that we've either captured or have come to us in submission to the government, had been the individuals that aided us in locating the leaders of the Chetnik organization and uncovering other Chetnik cells that we have yet to come upon. This information has been quite useful in our efforts to plug the holes in the nation's national security whilst we have been cleaning up any remaining Chetnik activity within the Serbian nation. We've made it known to these groups that we thank them for their assitance and that their actions to defend Serbia will not be forgotten by our government. Now it is time to round up the collaborating Chetniks and take care of them once and for all, they may have contributed to putting an end to these terrorists but alas they're one of them. Most prefer to not leave loose ends after doing a little bit of dirty work."
