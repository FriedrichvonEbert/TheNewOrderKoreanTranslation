    nuclear_war_category:0 "Nuclear Annihilation"
    nuclear_war_category_desc:0 "Our nuclear weapons are the most powerful tools we have to fight a war. Out of a fear of mutually assured destruction, we have been wary of using these awe-inspiring methods of total annihilation, but it seems all other options have failed. Nuclear fire is the way to winning a war - and in these times, these measures, it must be necessary to protect our nation, §Reven at the possible risk of the collapse of civilization, and a resulting nuclear apocalypse.§!"
    destroy_our_enemies:0 "Start a nuclear war."

    nuclearwar.1.t:0 "Choose The Targets"
    nuclearwar.1.de:0 "Before we begin our campaign of destruction, and possibly the last actions we will ever undertake as a nation, we must figure out our primary target for our nuclear stockpile to focus on. Doing so could possibly change the outcome of the war to our advantage.\n\nWe have a few options for ensuring complete and total dissolution of the enemy's will to fight. Our first option lies in direct attack of the armies of the opposing army - although the blasts may cause much damage to our formations, it would completely wipe out any chance our foe has of winning the war. Our next option is to attack the occupied territory of the enemy. Our third option is to attack their homelands directly. Most likely, this would cause them to capitulate instantly and make this war winnable. Or, if we have enough weapons, we can simply choose to attack everything at once.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
    nuclearwar.1.a:0 "Destroy their armies."
    nuclearwar.1.b:0 "Bomb the occupied territory of the enemy."
    nuclearwar.1.c:0 "Annihilate their homelands!"
    nuclearwar.1.d:0 "EVERYTHING AT ONCE!"
    nuclearwar.2.t:0 "The Ultimate Demand"
    nuclearwar.2.d:0 "Sudden and alarming news comes from the enemy force. Apparently in response to the course of the war, they have sent us an ultimatum: cease fighting immediately, or be destroyed with nuclear weapons. However, we cannot be sure how serious they are in terms of their threat. We can either attempt to end this conflict and make peace with our foes or call their bluff entirely.\n\nThe choice is up to you."
    nuclearwar.2.a:0 "It is best not to tempt fate."
    nuclearwar.2.b:0 "Surely they're bluffing."
    nuclearwar.3.t:0 "Peace Assured!"
    nuclearwar.3.d:0 "What seemed like certain doom of the world to the unstoppable force of atomic fire has ceased today. The enemy has conceded to our demands, and we are in emergency peace talks at the moment to avoid nuclear destruction. Soon this war will be over."
    nuclearwar.3.a:0 "Let us finish these talks."
    nuclearwar.4.t:0 "The Final Decision"
    nuclearwar.4.d:0 "We have offered peace to our enemies - we have offered peace, and if the peace was not taken, we would destroy them with nuclear fire. However, in their ignorance, they have called us foolish, and unwilling to use our nuclear weapons.\n\nWe must now decide whether to use our nuclear weapons, and deal with the consequences that come with it."
    nuclearwar.4.a:0 "Destroy them."
    nuclearwar.4.b:0 "We cannot deal with the consequences."
    nuclearwar.5.t:0 "Attack Warning!"
    nuclearwar.5.d:0 "Extremely alarming news! Radar and air defense systems have reported nuclear missiles launching from silos, and have also reported enemy bomber forces taking off. All trajectories predict they are heading for our nation, and it is very clear that a similar response must be made in order to protect our nation."
    nuclearwar.5.a:0 "Launch everything we have! Target list: all!"
    nuclearwar.6.t:0 "Incoming Response"
    nuclearwar.6.d:0 "Warning systems are picking up a wave of projectiles heading for our nation in response to our nuclear attack. It does not take a genius to figure out what has happened. Although shelter warnings are being given out to civilians now, we do not expect to fully survive this strike. One thing is clear, however. Nuclear war has just begun, and the world shall be changed forever."
    nuclearwar.6.a:0 "God help us all."
    nuclearwar.7.t:0 "The World Is Saved"
    nuclearwar.7.d:0 "We have prevented a full-on nuclear war from occuring, saving billions upon billions of lives and keeping the world of today surviving. For now."
    nuclearwar.7.a:0 "Who knew threatening people with nukes would get them to stop?"
    nuclearwar.8.t:0 "Are you sure you wish to do this?"
    nuclearwar.8.d:0 "Nuclear war is not a thing that happens lightly. If a nuclear war begins, there is no going back. Do you wish to continue?"
    nuclearwar.8.a:0 "Go go go!"
    nuclearwar.8.b:0 "Nah, I changed my mind."
