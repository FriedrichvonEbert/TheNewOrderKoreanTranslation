 ### Ideas ###
 AMK_klu_klux_klan:0 "Klu Klux Klan Influence"
 AMK_klu_klux_klan_desc:0 "Having played a key role in assisting our victory in America, the Klan has steadily gained more and more power within the Reichskommissariat in return. Now effectively acting as the enforcers of the German regime alongside the Amerika Garrison, the Klan have committed themselves to ridding the South of the Juden and African Americans; along with any others they deem undesirable. Whilst they may be rough around the edges, the Klan fulfils a crucial role in filling the gaps in our lines."
 AMK_free_american_alliance:0 "The Free American Alliance"
 AMK_free_american_alliance_desc:0 "Whilst the United States of America offered its unconditional surrender to Germany following our glorious conquest, many elements of American society have since refused to accept their new reality. Now an alliance of resistance fighters comprised of former American soldiers under General William Westmoreland, alongside the Black Panthers under Bobby Seale, fight a constant struggle against our regime."
 AMK_old_men_and_old_bread:0 "The Bare Minimum"
 AMK_old_men_and_old_bread_desc:0 "With the Reich now spread across most of the world, preparing for the next great conquest against Japan, and suffering from a lost generation in the wars leading to this point, only the bare basics have been left behind to garrison America. Germany is continuously reluctant to send us much in the way of reinforcements and equipment for the Amerika Garrison, making us increasingly reliant upon native collaborator movements to keep our grasp on the populace tight."

 ## Events ##
 AMK.1.t:0 "Debug Event"
 AMK.1.d:0 "This event is for debugging."
 AMK.1.a:0 "Let us debug."
 AMK.2.t:0 "The Führer Attends Washington DC Celebrations"
 AMK.2.d:0 "The United States of America is no more. Her cities, her resources and her people are ours. Almost four decades since we first took up arms against the Americans, their decadent, capitalist regime has crumbled. In celebration, a great series of celebrations and events are to be held across the American territories to enshrine to the American people their total defeat and their humiliation both.\n\nAt the urging of the Propaganda Ministry, the first of these celebrations was today marked with a massive victory parade held in Washington DC. Atop his white stallion, Field Marshal Schörner led the procession. Behind him came first those divisions which had taken part in the Battle of Washington DC, followed by the Panzer corps, and then those other divisions which had played a role in the defeat of America all in full dress uniform.\n\nForced at gunpoint to attend, the large crowds cheered and waved the flag of their new Republic as their 'liberators' marched past, the procession finally ending on the White House lawn for the Führer's speech. Göring spoke only briefly, giving his gratitude to Schörner for making this day possible, and expressed his regret that Hitler had not lived to see it. Whilst a number of Generals are reportedly displeased that the Führer seemingly forgot to speak of Japanese aggression against the Reich, the soldiers' cheers for Göring were deafening."
 AMK.2.a:0 "Heil Göring! Heil Göring! Heil Göring!"
 AMK.3.t:0 "The Destruction Of Lady Liberty"
 AMK.3.d:0 "The Reich's history has been defined by creation through destruction. The birth of the Third Reich through the avenging of the Second. The triumph over Europe by the sacrifice of millions against the evil of Bolshevism. This cycle endures with the final execution of our victory celebrations in America. The end of the symbol of the degenerate theories of liberalism and equality. The destruction of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nThe crowds assembled to witness this glorious event filled the New York streets to bursting as the Propaganda Ministry cameras broadcast the scene across the city and the world. From Ellis Island, tonight hosting a glamorous private party for top Party Officials and honored guests, the Führer stood beside the new President of the Republic of America watching as the show begun.\n\nWith searchlights illuminating the statue, the batteries of the battleship Tirpitz lined up and, as silent anticipation overtook the city, fired its deafening full broadside into the statue. Cheers then erupted across the Reich, a photographer capturing the stoic look on the Führer's face as the statue quickly began to tumble into the bay."
 AMK.3.a:0 "We shall replace her with a new colossus."
 AMK.4.t:0 "Reinforcements From The Reich Arrive"
 AMK.4.d:0 "Having receiving assurances signed by the Führer himself that the Reich would send the reinforcements he had finally convinced Germania we needed, Reichskommissar Hermann instructed that their arrival should be made a great spectacle. As the ship bringing the alleged finest the Reich had to offer moved to dock, the Musikkorps began to play Horst Wessel Lied at full volume as the crowds cheered. Television crews from the Amerika branch of the Propaganda Ministry broadcasted it all live, panning back and forth between the arriving ship and Hermann's beaming presence.\n\nAs the first man's boots touched the concrete, the assembled soldiers and civilians extended their arms and began a mighty roar of 'Heil Göring!' again and again as the 'Reich's finest' disembarked. Reichskommissar Hermann, however, was silent.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the forces Germany had send were far from what we had hoped. Whilst there were experienced soldiers among them, the bulk of the men who arrived were young conscripts with ill fitting uniforms and bewildered looks before all the glitz and glamor rolled out for them. At the end a number of injured soldiers were then unloaded who, whilst they were unfit for frontline combat, had papers dictating they were fit for garrisoning duties in the colonies. Unfortunately, the cameras captured and broadcasted Hermann's far from pleased reaction quite clearly."
 AMK.4.a:0 "These are the best they could send us?"
 AMK.5.t:0 "The Army Of The South"
 AMK.5.d:0 "Under the careful eyes of their German instructors, we have begun the process of transforming the Klu Klux Klan from a local militia into a fully militarized force capable of supporting our counter-terror and peacekeeping operations within the region. Buses filled with Klan recruits are now arriving at Fort Benning to undertake a specially crafted training regime which will put the former training of American soldiers to shame.\n\nUnder the Reichskommissar's orders the initial focus will be placed upon producing Klan infantry, heavy gunners, artillery crews and support units. Should the program prove successful however, there has already been suggestion of permitting the formation of more elite units including marksmen, an adapted Army Ranger program and perhaps even armored specialists to attach to our own Panzer divisions.\n\nTraining up the Klansmen will not be an easy task however; the American is a sub-par soldier to begin with, and the Klan has grown over familiar with its disorganized forms of violence. Several accidents and other incidents have already been reported from their overseers, but with every male Klansmen of serving age to now enter training we may finally be able to end our crippling dependency on Germany once and for all."
 AMK.5.a:0 "An army in the making."
 AMK.6.t:0 "Abwehr Reports Increasing FAA Activities"
 AMK.6.d:0 "Delivered onto the Reichkommissar's desk this morning was the Abwehr's latest report on resistance activities and growth in the days and weeks following the Führer's tragic death. Unfortunately, it is anything but good news. The increase in resistance chatter has confirmed our fears that the FAA would attempt to take advantage of the crisis within the Reich, and the Amerika Garrison has reported a noticeable increase in both the number and intensity of resistance attacks.\n\nIn response, the Garrison has been clamping down on the cities, introducing further movement restrictions and random searches, whilst also increasing the number of countryside raids. We have also send a copy of the report to Germania to request further reinforcements, yet so far our requests have gone unanswered.\n\nWhile our Generals reaffirm that should the resistance movements attempt any form of organized uprising they will be swiftly crushed, with the situation in Germania our own future appears as uncertain as that of the Reich itself."
 AMK.6.a:0 "The Reich could never abandon Amerika."
 AMK.7.t:0 "Schörner Recalls Amerika Divisions"
 AMK.7.d:0 "Chaos erupted today in Neu Aurelstadt when, following a short phone conversation, Reichkommissar Hermann announced to his Generals the orders which had just been given to him from Germania. Many of the reinforcements which have been sent to us by the Reich in the past months have now been recalled back to Germany, along with a number of our more elite divisions vital to securing the American South for the Reich.\n\nThe orders came directly from Field Marshal Schörner, who claims that in the wake of the Führer's death the situation in Germany has rapidly declined. The Marshal claims that our divisions are now required in order to allow him to 'secure Germania against those traitorous forces conspiring to destroy the Reich from within'. No reason was given why the regular Heer would not do, and despite Hermann's pleas, Schörner was unwilling to change his instructions.\n\nThe blow this represents is not lost on anyone within our regime. With us now having little choice but to allow so much of our best forces to return to Germany, how exactly we will now ensure the survival of our government in Amerika is a question no-one is eager to answer."
 AMK.7.a:0 "The games of those at home will doom us all!"
 AMK.8.t:0 "The Reichskommissariat Enters Lockdown"
 AMK.8.d:0 "Reichskommissariat Amerika has entered lockdown as our regime slowly comes to terms with one of the bloodiest days of its history. Robert Shelton, and steadily rising numbers of his Klansmen, are dead. Whilst en-route to meet with the Reichkommissar, Shelton's convoy was attacked and his entire entourage killed by FAA terrorists. By the time Garrison forces were able to respond, Shelton was gone.\n\nSearch parties located Shelton's charred corpse several hours later, having been tied to a Klan cross and burned alive following what is believed to have been extensive torture. Eager to claim responsibility, the flag of the Black Panther terrorists was brazenly displayed behind the scene. But it quickly became apparent this was a part of a much wider, coordinated attack.\n\nNumerous Klan facilities and rallies have come under attack by the FAA across the American South, with several weapon stockpiles having been destroyed and the majority of the Klan leadership left dead, wounded or missing. Leaderless, the Klan is quickly falling apart in the aftermath, while our own retribution has been swift and decisive. As mass reprisals get underway, we are left with the sobering reality that our last line of defense may have just been lost."
 AMK.8.a:0 "We will bring those murderers to justice."
 AMK.9.t:0 "The Uprising Begins"
 AMK.9.d:0 "In the early hours of this morning, it began. The residents of Amerika awoke to the sounds and sights of tanks rolling through their streets once again, but this time they bore the flag of the fallen United States of America. Four coordinated attacks quickly overwhelmed the stunned garrisons of Memphis, Richmond, Norfolk and Nashville. Major assaults then continued throughout the morning as FAA regulars continued to press the attack as the Amerika Garrison scrambled to respond, left reeling from an attack we never expected to be so well prepared.\n\nWe have been quickly forced onto the defensive, with equipment and manpower shortages crippling us across all fronts. A number of divisions have already been encircled, and the coordination on the ground level is a shambles. To make matters worse, the offensive was joined in mid afternoon by mass uprisings along the east coast and throughout Texas, effectively splitting our territory in two and largely cutting us off from the coast.\n\nThe fact that this offensive was seemingly launched from along our border with the Republic of America raises no end of suspicion, but what we do know that the future of Amerika will be decided here. Now it begins."
 AMK.9.a:0 "No, now it ends."
 AMK.10.t:0 "Black Panthers Launch Coup!"
 AMK.10.d:0 "Firefights consumed the streets of Houston today as Bobby Seale led his Black Panthers in storming the City Hall where General Westmoreland had established his headquarters during the uprising. After almost an hour of fighting room to room, during which most of his staff lost their lives, Westmoreland was finally cornered in his office and killed with two shots to the chest.\n\nThe street battles between FAA soldiers and their former Panther allies lasted much longer, going late into the night before the shots finally died down and Seale appeared on national television. He declared that the Black Panthers could no longer tolerate the oppression of the white man and criticised Westmoreland's decision to continuously put off the total liberation of the black man until America was reunified. The Panthers had not cast of one white master to return to another, and so had been forced to continue the revolution.\n\nSeale ended his impassioned speech by declaring that the black man need never bend to the will of the white man again, and that a new nation would now be forged in the American South, ruled by the black man for the black man."
 AMK.10.a:0 "Rejoice Brothers and Sisters!"
 AMK.11.t:0 "The FAA Is Crushed!"
 AMK.11.d:0 "As the final reports begin to come in from the field, it is becoming increasingly clear the decisive defeat we have inflicted against the Free American Alliance. We have pushed them back from every city, every town, every field and every hole they managed to stake a claim to. With the enemy uprising completely broken, the Garrison and the Klan are putting themselves to work mopping up the final pockets of FAA resistance as the Reichskommissar begins to celebrate this great victory.\n\nThe amount we owe to our Klan allies in achieving this victory cannot be overstated, and Hermann is already being hailed a strategic genius for embracing new levels of promoting collaborationist movements within the Reich. Their fighting ability under our careful training programs put them almost on par with any good German soldier, almost. Many officers on the ground cannot praise their Klan reinforcements high enough.\n\nNow that the resistance has been crushed, with Westmoreland himself having been killed when a Luftwaffe airstrike dropped napalm on what we later discovered was the General's command tent, we can once again begin to look to the future. Maybe, just maybe, the Reich will have a future here after all."
 AMK.11.a:0 "Hail the White Knights!"
 AMK.12.t:0 "A New Dawn For Amerika"
 AMK.12.d:0 "As the dust begins to settle from the recent FAA offensive, the narrow survival of the German regime has been celebrated in earnest by our forces. To properly recognize the heroes who made this victory possible, Reichskommissar Hermann had ordered a military parade be held in Neu Aurelstadt so that the public could properly thank their saviors before he personally addressed a number of Klan and Amerika Garrison soldiers at headquarters.\n\nHermann could not contain his happiness as he spoke to those assembled, and offered his highest praise upon the Klan who had made this victory possible. Our regime and alliance would last a thousand years he proclaimed before turning over the stand to Robert Shelton, leader of the Klan. Stepping up, Shelton offered his thanks to the Reichskommissar for the kind words before promptly drawing his revolver and shooting Hermann in the side of the head. Immediately, from the upper balcony Klansmen deployed an MG 42 and opened fire on the German soldiers and leadership below.\n\nBloodshed erupted across the American South as the Klan began to disarm and execute the shocked Amerika Garrison and seized key positions throughout the region. As the evening arrived, Shelton spoke again, this time to the American public. The German regime was gone he proclaimed, the true liberators of America had arrived."
 AMK.12.a:0 "One nation, under Klan."
