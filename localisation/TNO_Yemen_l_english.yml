 YEM_italian_overlordship:0 "이탈리아의 지배"
 YEM_italian_overlordship_desc:0 "제2차 세계 대전 이후 우리나라는 완전히 이탈리아의 영향권에 들게 되었습니다. 아덴만이라는 매우 전략적으로 중요한 장소 때문에 우리나라에 강한 존재감을 아직도 유지하고 있습니다. 이 말은 이탈리아가 우리의 외교 정책을 거의 휘어잡고 지시하고 있으며, 국내 문제에 대해서도 큰 영향력을 가지고 있다는 것을 뜻합니다."

 YEM_the_Aden_arsenal:0 "아덴 병기창"
 YEM_the_Aden_arsenal_desc:0 "이탈리아가 예멘에 보호혈 지위를 줌에 따라 이탈리아는 국가에서 제일 소중한 곳인 아덴 도시를 차지하였습니다. 인도양에서 제일 중요한 항구였던 아덴은 남아라비아에서 이탈리아가 제일 많은 병력과 함선을 배치시킨 최거점 도시가 되었습니다. 도시민 대부분은 이탈리아의 지배에 분개하고 있지만, 아덴 병기창은 이탈리아가 유일하게 예멘과 가까우면서도 영향을 받지 않는 곳에 군사력을 투영할 수 있는 유일한 주요 거점으로 남아 있습니다."
 
 YEM_saudi_influence:0 "사우디의 영향"
 YEM_saudi_influence_desc:0 "Yemen is nominally a Saudi protectorate, but the Italians have little way of actually influencing the court, and seldomly leave their stronghold in Yemen except for occasional forays to punish rebellious tribal leaders. In recent times, the Yemeni King has been finding itself more and more reliant on Saudi money and political support to keep itself afloat against internal opposition - but there are those who are bitterly opposed to Riyadh's newfound interest in the southern Kingdom."
 
 YEM_tribes_and_Sects:0 "Tribes and Sects"
 YEM_tribes_and_Sects_desc:0 "Yemen's landscape is predominantly mountainous, hilly and rural - and while the King and Imam nominally rules from his palace in Sana'a, power in the countryside resides in the hands of the numerous tribes populating it. What's worse, while the ruling minority in the country is Zaidi, the majority of the Yemeni population is Sunni, adding another layer of sectarianism to an already divided country. In response, many of the Yemeni youth are increasingly turning a reformist, pan-Yemeni ideology to finally bring change to the country."

 YEM.53.desc:0 "A civil war has broken out in the sandy, mountainous, wasteland known as the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, and it is in our interest to support the rebels fighting against the remote Arabian kingdom.\n\nThe rebels are fighting for an Arab Republic in the name of an ideology called "Ba'athism," which is a Pan-Arab nationalist and pseudo-socialist movement whose ideological intricacies are very complex and complicated. What is important is that they are challenging Italian and Saudi influence in the oil-rich Gulf region and factions of their movement are sympathetic to Germany.\n\nIf we send aid to these Ba'athist rebels and they successfully topple their Italian lapdog of a monarch, we could see our own geopolitical influence and economic power expand."

 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_YAHA_DESC:0 "Libya is the fourth shore, the first and greatest of the Italian colonies. Ethiopia is its most populous region, Egypt its breadbasket, and the Gulf Territories the source of its precious oil. The Imamate of Yemen is not much of anything. At a Triumvirate Summit in the late 50s, Mussolini himself committed a rare gaffe, forgetting the name of the current Imam, and quickly switching subjects in his shame. Ahmad Bin Yaha is not a man easily forgotten. He is powerful, but frail. He remains physically imposing even in his old age, but his mind grows ever more feeble thanks to his endless use of morphine. Under the British, Bin Yaha was a dichotomy, swearing loyalty and friendship to the empire even as he worked to undermine it. Under Italy, he is much the same. Were the lands he ruled of greater import, no doubt his underhanded moves would bring the wrath of the Mare Nostrum down upon Yemen, but for now, he rules unchallenged.\n\nBizarrely, for a man who clothes himself in jewels and golden cloth while his people starve, Bin Yaha is beloved by his subjects. Though there are reports of growing subversive movements in the army and civil service, Bin Yaha's face decorates the posters of every street corner, and when he travels, his caravan is mobbed by fervent admirers.\n\nBut he's also growing old. The Imam's visitors kneel before him and kiss his hands, and he pays them all the proper courtesies even if he doesn't remember their names. Though the Italian government is content to ignore Yemen so long as it pays its taxes and tributes, a few are already sounding alarms about how little prepared the nation is for a future without the firm hand of its ruler."
