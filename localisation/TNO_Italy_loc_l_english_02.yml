 ita.1.t:0 "이탈리아 제국의 상황"
 ita.1.d:0 "Italy's great gains in the Second World War seemed to promise a new awakening to the broken kingdom. Along with Germany, Italy would ascend to the ranks of global superpowers, masters of the world, the largest empire known since Rome, spanning Algeria to Syria, the Alps to the Horn of Africa. Yet fate is a wind, a gale that changes course at the slightest provocation. When Germany strongarmed Italy into agreeing with the Atlantropa project, the aging Duce Mussolini correctly predicted that the end of the friendship that had conquered Europe, Africa, and Asia was past it's time. The final straw came when the Germans, assailed on what seemed like every side by the resurgent Russians, attempted to force Italy into a war it had no part in. In a fury, Mussolini severed remaining ties with Germany, and as a final insult to Hitler, opened the Empire's borders to Jews, Roma, and any other 'undesirables' hunted by the Nazis.\n\nYet not all was well within the Empire. As the Duce aged, his mind grew more and more erratic, and the Empire nearly fell into infighting as Mussolini privately declared his plans to abolish the monarchy to his son in law, Galeazzo Ciano. Ciano proved himself a hero of the Empire when, against all odds, he convinced the Duce to spare the King, ensuring stability. Not a year later, the Duce died. Galeazzo Ciano was thus sworn in as Duce, and nearly immediately began to liberalize the country, pulling it away from the path Mussolini had taken it.\n\nThough a dedicated fascist, Ciano is an Italian first, and has claimed to recognize the failures within fascism, and promises reforms. Reformists see him as a democrat bringing down a corrupt system from within, moderates see him as a pragmatic fascist doing whatever it takes to keep his home alive, and hardliners, lead by the ideologue Carlo Scorza, see him as a traitor to their ideals.\n\nThe Empire stands on a precipice. Will Ciano succeed in his reforms and bring freedom to the people that demand it so, or will Scorza win out in the end, strengthening Fascism's grip over Italy?\n\nThe winds of fate have left Italy at a crossroads. Whether they take Ciano's road or Scorza's, the country must move forward."

 ita.2.d:0 "The government announced this morning that Duce Galeazzo Ciano has personally left Rome in order to attend this years Malta Conference. While in the past he would have simply sent a represenative, current tensions at home and abroad convinced him of the need to personally attend.\n\nMany in the international community spectulate that this is due to the rise in popularity of Carlo Scorza, who has proven himself an able adversary for the long time leader. Many speculate that Ciano is hopeful that a favorable resolution to the congress will revive popular support for his government."

All of these titles and more have been on the front page of nearly every Italian newspaper, the story they tell is largely the same. Natives being brutalized, worked to death, starved, all while being watched by our viceroy to East Africa Enrico Mattei.\n\nThe public is outraged by this news, with anti-imperialist protestors and students taking to the streets to demand the removal of Mattei. Even his former allies in the party seem to have abandoned him, with one anonymous member saying "most of the party had known that Mattei was a little too ambitious and ruthless for his own good, but we never imagined he was capable of this."\n\nWith pressure mounting, and the demonstrations starting to turn violent, we need to decide whether or not to do anything about this."

"터키 놈들을 아라비아에서 내쫓기 위해서입니다. 우리 아랍인들만이 할 수 있는 일입니다." 달라 키에사는 몇 초 동안 앞에 선 남자를 바라보았다. 장교 앞에서 그런 말을 한다는 것은 충격적인 일이었다. 잠시 후 키에사는 미소를 짓고는 군인의 이름을 물었다.\n\n"카다피입니다, 장군님. 무아마르 카다피 대위입니다.""

As the weapons loaded and the soldiers faced the protestors with weapons at the ready, the young rebels didn't flinch. They held banners telling them to go home, and held torches that have began to symbolize the people of Verona who oppose the army's actions in the city. A standoff was taking shape, and as an officer warned the people to disperse, they simply yelled back petty insults. At this point, the officer gave up and ordered the 133rd to open fire.\n\nThe turrets of the tanks fired shells that destroyed buildings, and rifles cut down the screaming rioters. The protesters were cut down like wheat at the harvest. As the army advanced, they began firing at not just those with banners and torches, but anybody they came across. Everybody there became guilty of association, even children, and the punishment was death.\n\nAs news of these events reached the ears of city officials, they realized that the city really was a victim of invasion. As such, a secret order was passed down to muster a militia consisting of policemen, veterans, and young men to try and repel the occupiers. It was clear the military was seeking a fight, and Verona was prepared to give them one."

And now they have the Verona militia guarding them, made up of young and old residents of the city who are armed with old rifles and makeshift explosives. If and when the army comes to put an end to the conference, they will have to battle the people of Italy who stand against tyranny and oppression. They will wage war with those they swore to protect, and they will spill the blood of their brothers.\n\nAs expected, the military came to put an end to the treason. And when they encountered an armed militia, they didn't even hesitate to put them down, each and every one. If a sniper was in an apartment, the tanks simply leveled the building. When an improvised explosive was encountered, they forced the onlooking civilians to walk through and clear the path. Even as the treasonous rats fired back and killed some of the brave sons of Italy, the soldiers only grew more angry. Entire stores burned, and ancient churches dating back hundreds of years crumbled into dust. The wrath of the 133rd was unmatched, and they slaughtered their way to the building where the true traitors lay, conspiring against Il Duce. There, they wait for the order to end this, once and for all."

Some shot themselves like cowards, afraid of the justice they deserved, while others cried. When the traitors were confronted, however, they said nothing and did not try to escape or bargain. The army quickly apprehended them, only to discover that one had a bomb hidden under his coat, ready to deliver one last message of resistance. Luckily, fate blessed us this day and the explosive failed to go off. In order to make sure no such things happen again, the officers decided to forgo a trial and ordered a quick execution. They were left in the building as the soldiers barricaded the windows and exits and lit the building on fire. Forgetting that it was a bar, the army quickly departed as the alcohol caused a rapid combustion, leading to surrounding buildings burning. The flames spread and spread, and eventually most of Verona was aflame. The 133rd evacuated the area before any harm could come to them, and and one commander made a remark stating that the burning of Verona was justice for the city's betrayal of Scorza and Italy."

The city officials weep, unable to fight the fire as all resources and water systems are gone by the hands of the army. Even the soldiers, now able to see the hell that they have created, can no longer find justice in their actions. In Rome, the few high ranking government officials that have knowledge of the military's actions now see who Carlo Scorza is, and what his intentions are for Italy.\n\nAn anger is burning brighter than the flames engulfing Verona, as everybody who can see the reality of what happened now boil with rage. The false dictator who labels himself Il Duce is nothing more than a coward, and his actions have seen nothing but pain and suffering. His opponents will remember this.

Even before the flames died, all sorts of government workers have flooded the area under the guise of humanitarian work. The truth is, they are mostly fabricating excuses and creating stories to justify the disaster and the numerous massacres committed by the Italian military.\n\nRome's official response to the international outcry has been that the city was plotting against the state and Il Duce, and as such, had to be put down. When the army came to enforce the peace, the civilian population rose up and declared rebellion. The military acted justly and with proper authority in handling traitors to the state.\n\nBut regardless of opinions, speeches, or the lies of Scorza, the truth can be found in the hundreds of butchered citizens and thousands of burned bodies buried in the rubble. The orphaned children and abandoned hospital patients could speak of the terrible atrocity committed by their own people, if only anybody would listen.

The residents of the fourth shore, however, do not hold the same views and instead feel that they are better off without us! They instead believe in ideals of autonomy, local rule, and other such liberal nonsense. This absurd notion must be put down immediately, and our ever loyal general dalla Chiesa is the man for the job.\n\nThe plan is simple, land soldiers and tanks in the colonies, shoot anybody who disagrees with our glorious leader, and burn any villages supporting the rebellion. Our navy will stand ready and threaten any foreign nation attempting to support the traitors, and our air force will obliterate them from above. As our brave men move alongside the coast and clear out the rebels, we can replace the incompetent governors with new people entirely loyal to Il Duce. And, when complete, we shall double the local garrison to ensure future revolts never even occur.\n\nAlready, our boys are landing on Libyan beaches and arriving into the dockyards, ready to serve their nation. Photographers and cameramen follow them, taking pictures for use in propaganda. The tanks will arrive later today, and with them, we will move onward, crushing the rebel scum under our tracts.

Through political connections and popular support these traitors pose a serious threat to the regime and must be silenced quickly. Luckily, the military has chosen to support Scorza in full, and already many of the local divisions are moving into Rome to secure the city. Hoping to avoid another Verona, the goal is to eliminate the use of vehicles and tanks and instead use ground soldiers to accomplish our task. By arresting and executing these rats, Scorza will finally be free to rule Italy as he sees fit, without anybody telling him otherwise.\n\nThe opposition has consolidated around many members of the lower house of Parliament, and as such it will be a good move to shut it down and arrest anybody suspected of treason. Special forces have been deployed to handle the delicate matter, and are expected to come into contact with the troublemakers soon. If all goes to plan, this maneuver will be smooth and simple, and little blood will be shed. As a bonus, hopefully the people will not be aware of our actions, as such matters are far too sensitive for them to understand.\n\nOnward, brave sons of Italy!

It was decided that him and his personal guard of blackshirts will storm the Chamber of Fasci after the soldiers clear out the building.\n\nAs the barricaded doors blew open, Il Duce emerged with his entourage. He moved up to the floor, with the confidence of a Roman general, and gave his speech. He denounced the treasonous activity and gave every member the last chance to declare their loyalty for the Empire and be spared his wrath. All the people there chose not to bend the knee, and instead sat in solidarity, unwilling to give the dictator the satisfaction. In disgust, Scorza gave them one last mercy; a chance to plead their guilt and have the honor of being able to execute themselves. When again, no one moved, Scorza began screaming at them in rage, announcing that they would all be put down like dogs. The soldiers raised their guns, and when Scorza gave the order, fired round after round into the crowd. It was then, when being massacred that they began to beg for his mercy.\n\nBut it was too late, as Il Duce no longer had any."

Everybody who knows the truth is absolutely loyal to Il Duce, and if any future incidents occur we know that the military has our backs. The people may not view us in the most positive light, but for now they support us. Scorza has the nation of Italy, and Italy has Carlo Scorza, for better or worse.\n\nOur atrocities must never be leaked, never be whispered in the shadows, and never told in a tavern after a few too many drinks. The punishment for even discussing these actions is death to the perpetrator and their family. We are on thin ice, and it only takes one idiot to make the cracks swallow us up, for what we did in Rome, in Verona... is unforgivable.

Scorza himself has released a televised speech denying the accusations, but the evidence is damning. The cracks are spreading, and everybody is holding their breath.\n\nThe military is already declaring martial law in a few cities witnessing intense protest, and many police stations are cracking down, and hard. Colonials all across the Empire are stirring in anger, and the populace is screaming for retribution. It appears that there isn't enough support for a total revolution, so Scorza is safe for now with the army at his side.\n\nWe have made a terrible mistake, and now it is time for us to pay. May the mercy that we failed to show our enemies be granted upon us."

 ita.44.d:0 "Our Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, recently returned from a meeting with key leaders in the Grand Council of Fascism in an attempt to sway them to his reformist agenda. Specifically, he targeted the bloc of old, hard-line fascists who either abstatined or refused to confirm him as Duce at the Verona Conference. Despite his best efforts, however, the Duce was unable to convince them to support him now.\n\nSpeaking to press a few hours after the meeting concluded, Ciano did not mince words. 'These gentlemen seem to be unable to accept that the world is changing around them. What worked in 1921 will not work today, and the solutions needed to fix our immense problems can not be found by looking into the past - but forward into the future.'\n\nCarlo Scorza, leader of the anti-reform block had no good words for Ciano either. In a leak of a speech to the Council obtained by the press, he denounced Ciano as a 'buffon' and a 'decadent, weak man unfit to fill the shoes of our first Duce'."

Moro and Fanfani were similarly pleased with Ciano: 'When Mussolini passed away we were fearful for the future.

 ita.123.d:0 "Inside the reinforced, sound-proofed control room of Italy's jackup platform that stood on the coast of Kenya, stood Armin Krüger. With five minutes until the countdown clock would reach zero, he observed workers scurrying to complete the launch procedures while his brainchild's upper stages were being filled with nitrogen tetroxide fuel. Two decades ago, he had been a pioneer of the emerging field of rocketry, helping to design the missiles that bombarded Britain in preparation for Operation Sealion. After the war, his future had looked bright. Germany, fresh from an unlikely triumph over the Allied word order, now had turned its gaze towards the stars. But then, less than a decade later, Germany's economy collapsed, and with it fell the German dream. Armin knew where the wind was blowing, and after much deliberation, he and his family fled across the border to Germany's new rival. Il Duce knew that space would be the next frontier for competition between the great powers, and sought for Italy to develop space launch capability of its own. Armin brought with him the secrets of German rocketry, and under the wings of the newly-established Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, he would begin to design a new family of launch vehicles. Now, years of labor were about to pay off. The Europa 1 rocket that stood in front of him was merely a demonstrator, as its three stages could only put a measly ton of payload into Low Earth Orbit, and could not launch payloads to a greater altitude. For now, that would be enough.\n\nSirens blared as the countdown reached its last minute. The workers scampered into the bunker as the Europa 1's stages pressurized. Armin waited as the moment of truth approached. Finally, with a flash of light and a tremor that, from this distance, shook the control room to its core, the rocket lifted off the pad, and ascended to the heavens. In only a few minutes, it escaped the Earth's atmosphere and boosted its payload into a stable orbit, two hundred and fifty kilometers above the Earth. The San Marco A, as the satellite was called, was quite primitive, containing only a radio transmitter and a sensor to measure the concentration of charged particles in the ionosphere. Still, it would be noticed by any ham radio operator beneath it. A day later, the Italian government announced that it had become the fourth nation to launch a satellite into orbit, and proclaimed that even the Earth's gravity well could not stop the flame of the fascist revolution.\n\nBut their work had only just begun."

 ita.124.d:0 "On a pleasant November morning, the Europa 2 rocket made its debut launch from the same jackup platform that had carried the San Marco A into orbit two years before. This launch vehicle was an evolution of the Europa 1 design, having been fitted with a fourth stage that would allow it to boost about a hundred kilograms of payload into geostationary orbit. A small margin, but one that would be sufficient for the mission at hand. This Europa 2 rocket would carry into orbit the San Marco D satellite - the last of ASI's initial forays into spaceflight. Once in orbit, the rocket's fourth stage would boost the payload to an altitude of twenty five thousand kilometers, right in the middle of Earth's Van Allen radiation belts. For Germany's moonshot, they would be easy to compensate for, as it passed through them in the span of a few hours, but keeping a satellite in an orbit that permanently intersected them would be a different challenge altogether. The San Marco D carried instruments to measure the density of the energetic particles trapped within the belts, along with their effects on electronics. The satellite operated for one week before suffering a catastrophic short-circuit and shutting down completely. However, the data it yielded would be invaluable to not just the Italians, but to satellite operators around the world. With this success, ASI continued to the next milestone of its project."

It sported radiation-hardened electronics designed using data gathered from the San Marco D satellite, allowing it to operate for years in the outer Van Allen belts. While it contained scientific instrumentation similar to those on its predecessor, its primary payload was a set of high-band transponders that would allow it to receive and transmit radio signals from across the globe. Over the next two years, ASI would use it to test the viability of using satellites to transmit not just radio communications, but television and even cinema. Many futurists had speculated about the possibility of creating a network of communications satellites in geostationary orbit for civilian use, and now, the Italians were attempting to bring one into existence. However, the satellites that would be required to construct such a network required a far higher payload capacity to geostationary orbit than the Europa 2 could provide. A new rocket would be required to complete this project. Fortunately, work was already underway on Italy's next launch vehicle. One that the entire world would take interest in."

 ita.126.d:0 "Armin Krüger stood inside the control room of the jackup barge as ASI's latest creation underwent preparations for its first flight. The skies were overcast, though the weathermen believed that the launch could proceed without significant risk. Seven years ago, he had watched Italy's first orbital rocket take off from this very facility, an event that had given hope to the lesser powers of the world. Now, he hoped that Italy could change the world again.\n\nThe Europa 3 that now stood on the launch pad was a radical improvement over its predecessors. Possessing a two-stage core design that could place seven and a half tons of payload into Low Earth Orbit, the Europa 3's standout feature was its modularity, as it could be augmented with an optional third stage and up to four solid rocket boosters. Fully augmented, it could place as much as eighteen and a half tons of payload into LEO or seven and a half tons into geostationary orbit. This upgrade was necessary, as spaceflight had long moved beyond the lightweight payloads that had flown in the early days of the Space Race.\n\nAs the countdown approached zero, Armin waited, fearful of the consequences if Italy's latest venture suffered an unexpected setback. Fortunately, the rocket took off without a hitch, its four RX.2 engines propelling it through the gray layer of clouds above the platform and out of sight. A few minutes later, the Europa 3 finished boosting the Sirio-2 satellite into its geostationary orbit. It was to be the first proper communications satellite launched by Italy, servicing the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Over the next few years, more would follow.\n\nThat would not be the most important outcome of the launch, however. Only a few days after the Europa 3's maiden flight, ASI made a surprising announcement: It would allow third-party operators to launch their payloads into space, and provided a range of prices for the various configurations of the Europa 3. Many nations and commercial satellite manufacturers alike began placing orders for ASI's launch services. This was the beginning of a commercial revolution in spaceflight that would transform it, as for the first time in human history, private entities and second-rate powers would have access to outer space."

Normally, patrolling the mountainous terrain was a break from the grueling exercise he would be subject to back at his assigned base - the biggest thing he had to worry about here was carrying the weighty Beretta rifle stored on his back.\n\nNowadays, though, walking the Alps was an exercise in disgust and fear.\n\nIt was no secret that the world was in utter chaos; the Reich had fallen to civil war, and the Nazi empire was quickly crumbling before them. That wasn't what disgusted him. To be honest, he was quite happy that the perfidious Germans, the ones that built the monstrosity of a dam, were once again enjoying sweet karmic retribution.\n\nThe newspaper had been keen to print out issues about the blazing Burgandianian advance into France. It was said that they fell even quicker than in World War 2; that now Paris and swathes of former French territory were now under the firm grasp of the Shadow State. Most people didn't really pay the news much mind: they were more concerned about their latest paycheck, or the most recent news about the state of their local bread prices. Roberta could not enjoy the luxury of not knowing, however.\n\nNow, every day he was assigned to patrol those damned mountains, he would encounter horror on a scale he didn't know was possible. Every day, he would encounter yet another wave of French refugees, most riddled with frostbitten gunshot wounds, barely alive. Those that did make it past the high peaks of the Alps frequently found themselves collapsing near the border, a scant few being dragged to something resembling a medical center, and then subsequently sent further inland for questioning. Most, though, were found gathering flies on the border, gunshot wounds riddling their battered corpses.\n\nEvery day he walked those mountain trails, he would be tasked with burying them in an unmarked ditch."

At this point, he was quite resigned in the face of whatever fate had in store for him. He sighed before donning his wide-brimmed straw hat, unlocked the truck's door gently, and stepped out into the desert.\n\nHe was stepping onto the carcass of the bright blue sea: Mare Adriatico. Often he dreamed of the days he'd spend out alone with the Sea and the Sky and the net, muttering lullabies to the gentle wind. Now, his days fishing in Venice were over and his livelihood came from driving through a desert of broken dreams for hours on end, delivering supplies to refugee camps.\n\nAnd oh, what the past had held. He'd eagerly joined the Fascist party in the 30s and still took immense pride from the fact: A loyalty that was rewarded - in a way - by the new Duce. The Job he held was a government one for which he was thankful. Still, the Duce was not the only man in the Party. Back home his own brother steadily aligned with Scorza's clique, and even he himself was swept away by the man's rhetoric and promises of a return to some glorious past. Yet as much as he enjoyed the debates and thrills of Rome's politics he knew full well that neither man could fill the Adriatic sea.\n\nGiuseppe's clothes stuck uncomfortably to his skin. At the head of the stopped convoy, a small circle of drivers and passengers surrounded the scene, blocking his view. He pushed into the commotion and was greeted with the sight of two corpses - no larger than teenagers, lying in the shade of a well-dusted wooden raft. Two German refugees that were left to rot in the sun after fleeing from the camps of Emanuele."

A cheer went up among the officers representing the military might of the world's fourth great power, but this was quickly quieted as the colonel raised a gloved hand. "At the same time however, we have judged that the Green offensive thrust into Algeria was not countered and their troops are marching on Oran."\n\nAn unhappy silence replaced what had moments ago been cries of excitement. While the Balearic Islands would prove crucial as staging grounds and forward bases against the enemy, the fall of Algeria would leave the door open to Libya and from there to Sicily.\n\nDe Lorenzo was contemplating what they could do next to regain the upper hand when Federico d'Aquino, who had been assigned to take charge of the defense of Algeria, moved forward with a jerk and raised his hand, "Excuse me sir, but do we still have the option of pulling our troops still in the region? We had six divisions and dozens of independent units in that theater." The umpire rubbed his chin thoughtuflly, "General d'Aquino, to answer your question: yes, although I must add that two of those divisions are not considered incapacitated and cannot be retreived." The younger commander nodded gravely, and with a motion of his hand to two of his adjutants, returned to the war room high command had designated for use in the simulation.\n\nThe umpire quickly conveyed the little of the message that remained and departed while the collection of generals broke into cliques of twos and threes to discuss their tasks. De Lorenzo surveyed them all with a mix of pride and worry, but reminded himself that despite the mistakes that had been and were likely going to be made, there was no better place to make them then in a game. In a game, failure meant embarrassment and evaluation, not death and devastation."

 ita.142.d:0 "Sergeant Giovanni Rossi was tired. He had spent the entire day sitting in a hot truck, all to only end up arriving at a tiny village located quite literally the middle of the Algerian desert.\n\nOnly somewhat able to relax on the worn fabric of the seats, he instantly fully alert when the truck jerked to a stop after so many hours of endless sand. Stepping out, even the annoyingly bright sun was unable to obscure the destination of their voyage through Algeria - just under the horizon, a group of small buildings, most no more than simple huts, was seen in the distance.\n\nHe, along with a squad of Italian soldiers, had come this far simply to capture - or kill - one individual: a partisan fighter, named the "Defender of Algeria." A well known resistance member, no more than 30 years old, the terrorist had tormented the Algierian garrison for months. Responsible for organizing raids on critical supply convoys, as well as the ringleader of the sporadic firefights near Italian military bases, the man had been a major thorn in the garrison's - and Rossi's - side.\n\nWhat had led them to his exact location, though, was an unprecedented escalation on the part of the partisan - he had made the grave error of directly kidnapping three Italian commanders after a particularly succesful raid on a transport convoy. Through some effort on the part of the local Italian intelligence team, Rossi's squad were able to track the location of both the rebel and his hostages, leading the them to this exact village.\n\nExplaining as such to the small squad of men that had arrived with him, Rossi started his march to the settlement - rifle in hand."

 ita.143.d:0 "After what had seemed like an eternity, Rossi and his squad finally reached the outskirts of the small settlement. The village itself, already unappealing from a distance, was no more attractive from up close. Mud bricks and torn fabric lined the most of the constructions present in the village, cracks showing and wood splintering under the pressure of time. Just before he and his squad were able to enter the village proper, however, Rossi noticed a glimmer of light in the distance. Focusing his eyes, he realized - it was a squad of Iberian soldiers, with vehicles to match!\n\nConfirming that he did in fact see the distinctive green and red of the Iberian flag, he motioned to his men. "Hold, men. I've spotted Iberian forces" As per protocol, he was now required to attempt to hale the Iberian forces and inquire as to why they were present in these Italian territory. There had been designated a specific frequency on the radio for this purpose - of course, decided after weeks of back-and-forth between Iberian and Italian radio officials. Unbuckling the radio on his belt, he communicated, "Unidentified forces present in Talmine, this is the Italian garrison, please identify yourself."\n\nQuickly getting a reply, "This is the Iberian Garrison, what the hell are you doing here? This is Iberian territory."\n\nRossi was flabbergasted. Yes, they were near the border, but this was clearly part of Italian Algeria! "I'm sorry, since when is this Iberian land? This village is harboring an active terrorist, and we suggest you do not interfere in our efforts to capture them.""

Turning back to the radio microphone, he sighed. "Are we talking about the same person here? The terrorist in question has directly taken valuable personnel hostage, and we shall do whatever is necessary to return them, regardless of Iberian objections."\n\nWith a crackle, the Iberians replied. "Considering the size of this village, I don't suppose there really could be anyone else." Pausing for a moment, the voice continued, "However, this individual has directly stolen essential supplies from the Iberian occupation zone, and as such, we request you do not attempt to once again interfere with our retrieval of material assets."\n\nRossi, stifling a curse, responded. "Did you not hear what I just said? We are actively retrieving personnel!" Nearly shouting, he continued, "We cannot wait for you to finish retrieving your equipment hidden God knows where!" Thinking for a moment, the cause for the sudden hostility - on Italian territory, no less - dawned on him. Just months ago, Italian soldiers had 'borrowed' Iberian equipment found in the wreckage of a successful partisan-led convey raid, much to the dismay of the Iberian garrison. Despite the Iberian claims that the equipment was "necesary for the continued safety of Algeria," no equipment was ever returned. Turning to his second in command, Rossi postulated his theory. "They're worried that we'll steal their equipment," Rossi explained.\n\nTaking in the thought for a moment, the Corporal gravely replied, "They're not going to let us through as long as this isn't a joint operation between the two of us.""

In fact, it turns out spending an entire day in the steaming hot of the Algerian desert while simultaneously negotiating a joint raid with Iberian soldiers - in a village no more than a hundred people in population - was a more mentally and physically tiring task than even the most arduous of training exercises.\n\nNight was already quickly approaching by the time final approval was recieved, and the quickly-dying orange illuminated the sands while Italian and Iberian soldiers converged on the very interior of the ramshackle village. Easily identifying the targeted building, Rossi quickly made his way into position along the brown wall of the structure.\n\nA faint sense of worry in his stomach, he gave the command.\n\n"Breach."\n\nPrivate Romano, clearly excited for the occasion, immediately kicked down the door with a deafening crack and plunged into the room, with the rest of the Italian squad in close pursuit. Expecting a firefight, the group instead were met with nothing.\n\nInside the dimly-lit single room of the building, neither the terrorist nor the hostages could be found, only the misty dust of the recently-destructed door. That is, until the recently-created hole opened just a small bit more. The room, becoming ever slightly more light, revealed the hanging corpses of all three missing officials, illuminated by the faint orange rays that had begun to make their way through the ruined doorframe.\n\n"Dammit," Rossi muttered, shortly before the Iberian soldiers likewise met them in the tight room."

Just years ago, he was the Duce of Italy, the sole leader of the State! And now, look at him. Being sentenced like a common criminal, told he was a traitor! He, as well as his legal team, had valiantly put up a defense against the bogus claims of Scorza, using every trick in the book to get him acquitted, or at the very least, not killed. Alas, such trickery would not save him. A sweat running down his brow, he readied himself for the final sentencing.\n\n"As such, you are hereby sentenced to 3 counts of life imprisonment."\n\nCiano remained silent. What was there to say? He had lost. Everything that he had attempted to improve during his reign - the Triumvirate, the Party, Italy - it would all be erased. His achievements would be struck from the record, one by one, until the only memory of Ciano would be of a failed tyrant.\n\nAs two stern-faced policemen began to handcuff Ciano, he began to laugh. The silence of the courtroom was broke, the chuckles of the deposed Duce echoing throughout. Oh, how ridiculous this was! Jerked forward, the daylight of the outside approached - his laughter only amplifying. Finally thrust into the bright light after what seemed like a lifetime, the laughter consumed him.\n\nHe managed to let out one last shrill cry, before he was stuffed into a black police cruiser - never to be seen again."

The Italians believe that mutual cooperation will be the best course of action in diverting conflict, and that working together will ensure the two nation's mutual survival in the face of this new threat, even if they aren't too keen on making friends with the Iberians. Although Italy feels that the only sane option for Iberia would be to work together again, the diplomats exiting the first meetings have been left with mixed feelings about the whole affair. This is due to the Iberians asking hard questions about the Gibraltar Dam payments, the Italian Empire's inability to keep the Triumvirate alive, and general bickering between the Spanish and Portuguese representatives over even the most trivial detail. To all of this, the ambassadors had little to reply with. Rome is currently praying that Iberia will advance negotiations and come to some sort of agreement with them. "

The Turks were not surprised at us reaching out and have already allowed the ambassadors to re-occupy the abandoned embassy. Anti-Italian hostilities still run rampant throughout the nation, however, and the diplomats have had to be escorted in bullet-proof cars and be given personal bodyguards by Turkey when out in public. Angry citizens throw bottles at their lodgings and scream for them to leave and never return, while the streets are packed with protesters vehemently opposed to their presence. The Turkish government has had a different view of the diplomats, seeing this as an opportunity to protect themselves from the openly malicious Germans, but are stuck in a hard position in which if they accept Italian cooperation, they will lose massive support from the local populace and if they refuse to negotiate they leave themselves vulnerable to Nazi invasion. They have so far been supportive of Anti-Italian policies as a means of gaining political support but taking such a stance here would certainly be suicide in the long run. As a response to this delima, the Turks have agreed to allow for the Italians to stay but have been unclear about any further action.

With some outreach and old weaponry dating back decades, we are sure that the Balkan region can be turned into a meat grinder able to both terrify and annihilate German divisions under Göring and his buffoons. The new Führer may have his nuclear arms and other wonders of science, but now we can harness our own secret weapon in the shape of insane partisans. Already, the Italian government has started strengthening ties with Croatia, Serbia, and others in an attempt to show that the Italians are friendly and willing to work together to repel any foreign threats. The response and leveling degrees of mutual cooperation between these nations and Italy in the future are completely unknown, but the military has already begun making connections of their own with rebel groups, nationalist organizations, and pretty much anybody we have struggled with in the past.

However, there have never been great relations between our two nations, who were technically at war during the 1940's, although no fighting broke out between the two. And due to America being a democracy, their response can be unpredictable. Who knows how Uncle Sam will respond to possible involvement in another foreign war? And there is always a sense of anxiety when nations with nuclear stockpiles clash. In the end Italy is still optimistic about American support and entirely dependent business connections there.

Our first step was to contact the Chrysanthemum throne, although any beneficial response is unlikely. That is exactly why the majority of or resources will be devoted to lobbying the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy. It is expected that the navy and army will both see honor in our cause, however anything is possible and they may not be in a position to provide actual support aside from a few statements. And if the navy or army found out we were courting the other, they may both become bitter and completely stop all talks.

Such things would be considered somewhat normal, but there seems to be a pattern in place. At the same time, agents have reported that FD members and supporters have been intimidated or beaten up. We know for sure that the Brigate Nere are no more and that Farinacci's dead, but after frisking a suspicious student outside an university in Milan, policemen found a gun that had been recently stolen and a flyer containing propaganda for an organization or group called "NAR". So far, our policemen agree that these groups are probably just a small remnant of the Brigate Nere of old, and it's highly unlikely that they could be in any way connected to the recent robberies.

Even though the desert state has a remarkably low population and is a rather embarrassing part of our empire, its people still have a right to vote for the Italian leadership fairly. How such an idiotic mistake could happen is currently baffling Rome, as it now appears that we will have to completely start the process over from scratch, from the bottom up, to ensure that these elections can be completed with every state having the ability to vote equally. This entire process hopefully won't delay the elections, but it will cost us a large sum of money to fix this simple mistake. Worse yet, many are even considering just abandoning Benito as a cheaper alternative, something that would surely cause massive outrage and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThis is just a small part of a much larger problem, which is that the Italian Empire has very little experience in running a democracy and our bureaucrats are overwhelmed with the stress of putting on elections. The general confusion that has taken hold of the government has left us with a quite disorganized, sloppy mess with problems ranging from non standardized ballots to forgetting an entire state. Even Ciano himself seems to be in over his head as he begins to realize how difficult this process is going to be. These are rather trying times, but if we can somehow make it through these elections we should be much more prepared for the following ones to come. Let's just pray that our streak of bad luck will end and it will be smooth sailing from here on out. "

 ita.6002.d:0 "Being a minor party, nobody in Italy believes that Bruno Visentini and the Partito Repubblicano Italiano can win these elections. Determined however to give it his best shot, Visenti has decided to go full throttle and go for the victory. Today, as an attempt to get the people on his side, he has travelled to the University of Bari to give a speech to the students and encourage them to vote for him and his party.\n\nHe delivered his message in a small conference room on campus, with an audience of less than fifty people present and only one reporter, who was half asleep. Not to be discouraged, Visenti spoke with his usual energy, proudly exclaiming that he saw no reason why a little party like his couldn't win seats in Parliament and why even the people in that room could make all the difference. Ever smiling, he even answered questions directly asked by the audience, being caught off guard by how difficult they were. But even when asked why he even bothered running, he exclaimed proudly that he definitely won't win if he doesn't try. After talking for a bit more and making some awkward jokes that didn't quite land, he ended the speech with his new slogan of "Go we go", which he tried to get the crowd to chant with him, unsuccessfully.\n\nAs if not embarrassed enough, when Visentini turned around he noticed a portrait of Aldo Moro, his rival leading the Christian Democrats and apparently an alumni of the university, hanging behind the podium he was speaking at. And yet, even though he began to feel discouraged, he kept smiling as he left, unwilling to let down his party and the Italian people."

 ita.6003.d:0 "As part of our attempts to get a good idea as to how these elections will turn out, we have commissioned polling associations to go from town to town to randomly select individuals and ask them who they planned on voting for. The results are still mostly being processed and will likely be only available a few days before the elections themselves, but we have discovered one alarming trend.\n\nIt appears that in Sicily, especially in the regions scattered with old people's homes and retirement communities, there has been a shocking number of citizens declaring that they want Benito Mussolini to win in the coming elections. Apparently, the old Duce was still quite popular and even the fact that he was deceased was not enough to keep him out of politics. When confronted about why they would choose a candidate from beyond the grave, the elderly voters either were confused and thought he was still alive or were just in plain denial that he could ever not be Duce. While the numbers were nowhere near high enough to actually influence the election results, this does show one of the very flaws in democracy that ironically the fascists have targeted for decades, in that some people are simply too ignorant to choose their own leaders, and yet these ignorant people seem best drawn to the fascists who most lack respect for them.\n\nIn any event, this odd situation has become quite a joke around Italy, with pranksters making fake campaign posters of Mussolini and newspapers reporting on his popularity alongside the actual candidates. Even Ciano himself is reported to have burst out laughing upon hearing the news, finding humor in the peculiar adoration his father-in-law still contains in the hearts of the people."

 ita.6004.d:0 "The press today was once again filled with explosive headlines about the Blocchi Nazionali. This time, it was about the blatant ties between the BN and the former Partito Nazionale Fascista. While if was fairly obvious that the BN was full of borderline fascists or even actual fascists, the breadth and depth of the ties were unknown until now.\n\nAn investigative journalist successfully infiltrated the BN and what they found was "horrifying", as the Fronte Democratico put it. Money from the old PNF was put in the BN coffers. Politicians basically swapped parties and stayed in the same seat. Nepotism favoring senior PNF politicians. The findings of the journalist went on and on. While the other scandals were eventually weathered, this scandal has hurt the BN greatly. Some politicians involved in the scandal have resigned, causing special elections that the BN is unlikely to win. Multiple members of the BN in parliament have turned their coat and joined the right wing of the Democrazia Cristiana, and worst of all, the BN is starting to lose members at a steady rate. If the trends are to continue, the BN would no longer be the biggest party in Italy, and they could even lose their majority in Parliament.\n\nAlmirante, surprisingly, has responded to this scandal. He has decried them as false reports, and that the so-called 'journalist' is nothing more than a Fronte Democratico spy! Most high ranking BN members have followed his word on this, especially the members who are implicated in the scandal. It is clear that the BN is sticking to their by now classic strategy of weathering the newest scandal."

 ita.6005.t:0 "An Interview with the King"
 ita.6005.d:0 "A recent interview of Umberto II by Franco Alfano has ended up causing another scandal for the Blocchi Nazionali. Almirante has been praising the King of Italy in nearly every speech or discussion recently, to the point that Pietro Nenni, leader of the Fronte Democratico, jokingly praised the king himself in one of his speeches, to much laughter. Therefore, when Umberto II has interviewed recently, it was obvious that Alfano had to ask what Umberto himself thought of the matter. His answer, was...surprising to say the least.\n\nUmberto called Almirante's constant praise an attempt to suck up to the monarchy, and then proceeded to say he'd rather talk about his new medals obtained in service to Italy, which he did for a solid 30 minutes, almost half of the interview. This has turned into an incredibly embarrassing event for the BN, as it shows that the King of Italy basically thinks of Almirante as a joke. This has also, predictably by this point, turned into a scandal.\n\nThe scandal that has erupted from this is about the fact that if the King of Italy cannot even vouch his nominal support to the BN, then what right to they have to rule? As is the case, the BN have remained very quiet, and Almirante has apparently remained unfazed, although he does not praise Umberto II very much anymore, much to the sadness of the FD, who cannot make jokes about it anymore.\n\nIronically, many war veterans who have medals have been interviewed about them due to this, and it seems Umberto has gotten in on the joke, and he can now barely be seen without his frankly impressive collection of medals pinned on his clothes, much to the exasperation of the BN."

 ita.6006.t:0 "Another Scandal for Almirante!"
 ita.6006.d:0 "To absolutely no one's surprise, the Blocchi Nazionali have involved themselves in yet another scandal. Almirante made a recent speech about his past in fascist Italy, and praised it greatly. Not only that, he called it "a much more prosperous time", much to the horror of basically everyone who aren't fascists. Furthermore, he stated that "Fascism did nothing wrong" which has basically led to his utter ridicule in the media.\n\nThe media, besides ridiculing him, has completely dismantled every part of his speech ana pointed out why every section of it was false or wrong. The Fronte Democratico has finally blatantly called Almirante an "idiot", while the Democrazia Cristiana has seemed to support the sentiment of the FD. Even some of the people in the BN have said that "perhaps it was not such a good thing for Almirante to say", which is incredibly radical for them.\n\nIn comparison, the openly fascist groups of Italy have declared support for Almirante, as "he understands when Italy was at its zenith and why". This has led to a split of sorts in Italian society, as the fascist sections are now in full alignment with Almirante, while the anti fascist sections are in a strong opposition to him."
 ita.6006.a:0 "How will the Blocchi Nazionali recover from this?"
 ita.6007.t:0 "Almirante Goes Before the Chamber"
 ita.6007.d:0 "Today, Honourable Prime Minister Giorgio Almirante has addressed the nation in a speech broadcasted by radio and television. With fiery rhetoric, Almirante offered his account of the events since the inception of Ciano's reforms, including the creation of the Blocchi Nazionali, and the elections themselves. He admitted that his party often "did not show fully its commitment to the democratic cause", but he went on to remark that pride in fascism isn't nostalgia, and that it is not incompatible with genuine love for democracy.\n\nGiorgio Almirante went on to explain the aims and the policies which the Blocchi Nazionali will pursue, and to show that they are merely expressions of the people's will, not a return to the past. Finally, the Prime Minister ended his speech by blaming the political tension experienced by the country on the left opposition. The Fronte Democratico, said Almirante, "isn't very democratic at all, considering their hatred for the democratically elected government". Almirante concluded by saluting the Italian people, and by assuring it that with the Blocchi Nazionali in power, the nation is in good hands.\n\nImmediately, it appeared clear that with this speech, Almirante would finally win over the silent majority of the nation. While leftist groups are still staunchly opposed to the government, moderates and centrists are finally convinced of Almirante's good intentions and political competency, there are rumors that Moro's DC, or at least its right wing, could finally openly side with Almirante's BN. Only one thing is certain, that now, the Blocchi Nazionali have the reins of the nation firmly in their hands, but nobody knows if they will steer Italy towards democracy, or back towards fascism."

And when it became time for the citizenry to vote, they showed their confidence in us by giving us a mandate of power through the democratic process.

And now that we have achieved victory in these elections, they should be much more receptive to our attempts to negotiate, even if they are a bit embittered at their losses. Hopefully, we will be able to achieve enough support from at least one party to easily pass any and all reforms that we hope to see be put into place.

This pleases our leadership greatly, as we have yet to achieve the majority it would take to pass any bill we wish. Therefore, in order to further test their commitment to a possible coalition government, Aldo Moro will seek to meet with his rival Giorgio Almirante so as to put our squabbling behind us and move forward hand in hand with the intent of efficiently legislating.

Now that we have the authority to fulfill our promise, it is time to begin meeting with the generals and representatives of the military do decide what is necessary for them to maintain their fighting ability without overspending ourselves. While many in the party are generally opposed to the expansion of our army and navy due to the need of scarce resources elsewhere in the nation, they will have to accept that we made a promise and that if we break it we will be unable to perform any legislative action as long as we exist."

Although Almirante and his goons will be hard to convince, the truth is self evident that they aren't what they think they are and if they refuse to cooperate their party will likely fall into irrelevance by the next election. Of course, the very existence of their party is based off of the fact that they can't let go of the past and begin again in a new Italy, so who knows if they can abandon their ways for the common good.

As a way to finally become closer with the Blocchi Nazionali, we must dispel these rumors, as they currently drive a wedge in between us. This can be accomplished by a new campaign consisting of the adoration of our motherland and our willingness to protect her and her interests.

 christdem.1.t:0 "Christian Democrats Victorious!"
 christdem.1.d:0 "The votes have been counted, and it has become clear to all of Italy that Aldo Moro and his Christian Democrat party has seized control of the government. With strong showings in both the upper and lower chambers of Parliament, the Christian Democrats have dominant legislative power in Rome, and it is now their turn to lead the nation. Celebrations are already taking place in the streets, not only because of who won, but because they just had their first free and fair elections in a very long time.\n Moro, in response to this great victory, aired a speech on the radio welcoming the election results and showing his appreciation for the trust given to him by the Italian people. In this broadcast, he first thanked the people for electing him and promised to do everything in his power to improve their lives and the state of Italy. Next, he went on to explain how his government would work towards ensuring that the other parties are still given a fair voice and the ability to cooperate in matters of policy. Cheerfully, he went on to explain that this was a new dawn for Italy and for the first time in a long time her future is looking bright.\n After the broadcast, the losing parties gave their concession speeches, and although not nearly as joyful, the public was happy to see them accept defeat with grace. Now it is time for Moro to really reform the Empire to his liking. Having platformed on mostly education reform and social security, it is predicted that he will follow through and let them be his main focus for the time coming. He will also attempt to work with the other parties, even the Blocchi Nazionali, to make certain that this first democratic government doesn't collapse as a result of infighting. This is a historic day for not only Moro himself, but all of Italy and the world."

 christdem.6.t:0 "Christian Democrats Open Coalition Negotiations"
 christdem.6.d:0 "In the ecstasy following the Christian Democrats victory in the Italian Empire's first democratic election, it was easy to forget a hard truth, despite their strong showing, the CD fell far short of a majority in the Italian Parliament, and hence, to accomplish anything significant in their agenda, must make a coalition agreement with one of the other parties. The Christian Democrats first choice would be the Fronte Democratico, who share their commitment to Italian Democracy and desire for entitlement and education reform. However, early signals from the SD seem to suggest that this course will be difficult. As the price for their cooperation, The Fronte Democratico have demanded that the new educational curriculum include a segment on the "fascist period" and in particular, the "clerical institutions", who through their "cooperation" with the oppressive regime extended its longevity and cruelty. A suggestion that is considered frankly insulting by the strongly Catholic CD.\n\nOf course, the Fronte Democratico are not the only potential coalition partner for the Christian Democrats, there is also the Blocchi Nazionali-- the avowedly nationalist organization made up almost entirely of former Fascist Party members. The NB's leader Giorgio Almirante has declared his parties great willingness to cooperate with the CD, calling them "our brothers, dedicated to a strong Italian Empire", and has asked for only minor concessions as the price for a coalition government. However, the Christian Democrats fear polluting their commitment to the new Italy by working with a party that still salutes Mussolini the Patriot besides Ciano the Reformer. During the campaign, the CD had firmly disavowed any possibility of allying with the National Bloc, but the CD's leader Aldo Moro has since walked back this position, claiming that his party is "open to working with any group that believes in a peaceful democratic Italy". Some have argued this is just a tactic to pressure the Fronte Democratico to ease their coalition demands, while others believe it prestiges a broad right-wing coalition."
 christdem.6.a:0 "We must find a partner worthy of our ambitions!"

 christdem.7.t:0 "A Meeting with the Blocchi Nazionali"
 christdem.7.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has personally sat down with Giorgio Almirante and other Blocchi Nazionali party officials to discuss forming a coalition government in Parliament. So far, Almirante's party has expressed a willingness to work with the Christian Democrats and this meeting had high expectations attached to it by both parties. It began rather formally, with hand shaking and smiles and the politicians all acting as if they were old friends and not just recently tearing each other apart in the elections. However, as talks began and the Blocchi Nazionali began making their demands, it became abundantly clear that there would be no compromise. To start off with, Almirante refused to negotiate if Moro pursued his policies of education reform and social security, saying that both would end up damaging Italy more than helping it. He went on to counter every single proposition made by Moro and practically inferred that there would be no reform in a coalition with his party. As if that wasn't enough, the final nail in the coffin was when Almirante began to rant about how the Christian Democrats should instead support his policies rather than pursue theirs and that was the only way to keep the Italian Empire alive. Realizing that this was completely futile, the Christian Democrats began signaling that no coalition would be made and that the meeting had come to a close. Not understanding, or perhaps not caring, Almirante only continued on with his insane plans, explaining the political situation as if the Blocchi Nazionali had won the elections and they were trying to make a coalition. About an hour later, Almirante was finally satisfied with himself and let the meeting end. The damage had already been done, however, and it was plain to anybody in Rome that there was no chance of the two parties working together in the future."
 christdem.7.a:0 "Probably for the best, all things considered."

 christdem.8.t:0 "Negotiations Complete"
 christdem.8.d:0 "The Christian Democrat party has officially formed a coalition with the small Liberal Party under Bruno Visentini, and the talks with the talks with the Fronte Democratico have mostly concluded and are generally positive. With enough support behind him Moro is now ready to move onto other priorities, chief among them actually passing the gradual reforms that we campaigned on. It is high time we actually create some legislature, after all that is what we were elected into office to do. The initial bills have been drafted and they are ready to be introduced into the lower chamber. Hopefully, we will be able to get them through with enough support in the coming future through our deals and coalition. Every single representative that has been recently elected is quite excited for these first few steps, and the people cry out for us to take Italy by the hand and lead her to a brighter world, and it is our duty to oblige them. We will make these ideas and reforms into law and not allow anything to stop us in our great quest to bring upon a better world. Hopefully, the other parties can see the same thing and work with us rather than against us, for only together do we have a chance of actually accomplishing anything. Moro himself is perhaps the most optimistic, being described as constantly smiling and always happy to discuss policy with anyone in ear reach. He has even held conferences with individual deputies to both ensure their support and ask their opinions on key issues, never fading in his hope to create a good, functioning administration. It is not sure if he will maintain this enthusiasm, however, as politics is said to destroy even the most iron of wills."
 christdem.8.a:0 "Let's get down to business!"

 christdem.9.t:0 "Education Reform Bill Proposed in the Chamber"
 christdem.9.d:0 "The Democrazia Cristiana party has recently proposed their first bill meant to address the education problem in Italy. The bill, entitled the Delegated Decrees on Schooling, or "Moro Reform" would include a variety of reforms mostly centered around mandatory education in primary and secondary levels of schooling for all Italian youth.\n\nHowever, we are a long way off from turning this bill into a law as the process has only just begun. If we wish for the reform to ever come into reality, we must must work tirelessly to convince the other parties to support it. Specifically, we need either the social democrat votes or the fascist votes in order to pass the law. The Liberal Party, while small and mostly insignificant, will likely vote with us without any accomodation, but it is certain that the two major parties will request certain provisions to be added or removed and we will have to negotiate to earn their favor.\n\nThis is still a great step for our administration, and the people will be excited to know that we are actively setting out to accomplish our promises. If we succeed, this will both be a major victory for our party and all of Italy, for by educating the youth we will truly earn our place as a modern nation with modern principles."
 christdem.9.a:0 "Moro will get us those votes!"

 christdem.10.t:0 "Peeling Away Votes from the Fascists"
 christdem.10.d:0 "Although we were unable to form a coalition with the Blocchi Nazionali, there must be a few less extreme member of the party who would support these minor reforms. It is now time to do every deputy's favorite task, going around and begging other representatives to try and support our legislature that will soon be decided upon. All it should take is a little bit of compromising and a sprinkle of smooth talking from Moro to convince at least a few of the idiots to support our bill, right? Of course, nothing is that simple, as many are either making outrageous demands or giving vague responses, leaving us unsure of whether or not they will be on our side. This is troubling, but hopefully we managed to get some of them to vote with us, at least enough to secure a majority when the final vote is made in a few weeks. In the end, the fascists will at least be grateful that we tried to include them in the negotiations, and this could plant the seed for future cooperation when they inevitably get sick of being in a party that can't accomplish get any bills passed. Only time will tell if we can achieve our task of giving education to the children of Italy. Surely, partisan troubles can't possibly stand in the way of common-sense reform, not forever. Moro has one more meeting with some of the members of Blocchi Nazionali soon, and it may be his final chance to gain the support he needs."
 christdem.10.a:0 "Democracy isn't all it's cracked up to be."
 christdem.10.b:0 "We need the votes, no matter the cost."

 christdem.11.t:0 "The Final Demands"
 christdem.11.d:0 "Today, after Moro sat down with the remaining Blocchi Nazionali members who are still on the fence about the education reform, he finally got the list of what it would take to get their votes. These demands were handed over with very little formalities or subtly, with the clear assumption that unless the bill had what they wanted, there would be no votes for it from them. The first demand was that of historical revisionism. The fascists are rather afraid of us introducing educational materials and works that would counter what they believe to be indisputable facts. They still see Benito Mussolini as Italy's great savior, and they simply must have him and the Fascist Party be given the appropriate attention and praise that they deserve. While we would never dare enforce anything that challenged Mussolini's fame and importance, this appears to be seeking praise of the very system of government we just abandoned for good reason, and many of the misconceptions that the Blocchi Nazionali would like to see pushed in schools are borderline lies and propaganda. However, the writing is on the wall, and we will have to conform to what they want if we wish to gain their votes when the time comes. Now, our party is faced with this dilemma. If we do what Almirante's party wants, we could secure the support we need while sacrificing many of the values and honest beliefs that we campaigned on. If we fail to gain the votes, our reform's could fail to pass and the children will suffer for our inability to take action. The ball is now in the Christian Democrats court."
 christdem.11.a:0 "Compromise is a wicked thing."

 christdem.12.t:0 "Securing Internal Support"
 christdem.12.d:0 "With the bill to reform the education system in Italy no longer new news, it has become necessary to ensure that the members of our party are still fully behind it. After all, this is a pillar of the Christian Democrat platform and our survival in the political landscape depends on our ability to band together and pass the essential legislation that we promised to the voters. Fractures in the party lines now could also lead to more trouble down the line, and then there would be no hope for us to win the next election. We will start with simply reminding the deputies that align with us of the importance of this bill to ensure that they do not get distracted from the primary task at hand. Meanwhile, a renewed advertising campaign will both rile up the public and put the pressure on the parliament to see FEOTA is able to pass through and become law. The public has already shown a determination to improve educational standards in the elections, and forgetting to fulfill that promise we made to them would be fatal for any party member seeking to be reelected. Of course, we are not expecting any resistance from our officials in regards to the situation and are not seeking to threaten them in any way, instead, we only seek to unite them at a time when unity and cooperation are the only things keeping the government, and all of Italy, together. After this shake up, we will be primed and ready to restart our efforts towards converting the votes of opposing parties to achieve the majority we need."
 christdem.12.a:0 "Let's hope this all pays off."

 christdem.13.t:0 "Moro gives speech in support of reforms"
 christdem.13.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has given a televised speech to the people of Italy in an attempt to build support for the Moro Reform. Education reform has been a constant demand by the populace, and Moro is hoping that they will pressure the members of the other parties to join on in support of the legislation.\nHe began simply, speaking about the abhorrent history of Italian education in the last century, how it has lagged behind the other nations of Europe and how even today hundreds of thousands of Italian people don't even have a high school diploma. He then spoke of the wonders of mandatory education and how a simple high school education, while somewhat difficult to attain, would serve the children of Italy for the rest of their lives. This would give the poor the opportunity to become rich, the ignorant to become scholarly, and the lazy to become hard working, only if the nation could unite and pass the bill that the Democrazia Cristiana have proposed. He finished the speech with a plea to the Fronte Democratico and the Blocchi Nazionali, a plea for unity and solidarity to pass the bill that will give young Italians everywhere the chance that they need to succeed in life. Moro explained that this is not a partisan issue, or even a political one, but it is instead a moral obligation that we have to our children and country.\nRousing many, public opinion polls have already shown an increase of the bill, and many party officials are hoping that this translates into political influence and votes from the other parties. At the very least, we put on display our concern and love for the people, and our opponents will have to fight an uphill battle to challenge Moro now."
 christdem.13.a:0 "The people stand behind us!"

 christdem.14.t:0 "A Meeting with Fronte Democratico"
 christdem.14.d:0 "The more liberal elements of our party have taken it upon themselves to meet with the left-wing Fronte Democratico party in an attempt to ensure they support our education bill when we hold the vote on the issue. Thankfully, we appear to be in good graces with the party and the hopes are that they will help is in this matter, giving us the votes we need and the ability to work closely with them in the future. Of course, we know that they will want us to make changes to the bill and reform the system to a much higher degree, but there is nothing in the legislation itself that the party would find repugnant and it is likely that we won't have much trouble getting them on board. We have even sweetened the deal by promising them future cooperation in regards to other reforms and policies that they find beneficial. The parties response has so far been a bit cautious, but mostly optimistic as education is a pillar of society that we all see is worth mending. It is predicted that they will give us an official response soon regarding their stance, and when they do we will know what must be done in order to achieve that threshold of supporters necessary to secure the bills chance of success. Meanwhile, this meeting has been met with criticism from the Blocchi Nazionali, who sees this move as disrespectful and weak. While their words do not affect us, we must make efforts to keep our independence and not really on other parties too much to achieve legislative progress. "
 christdem.14.a:0 "We must keep moving!"

 christdem.15.t:0 "Fronte Democratico Gives Their Reply"
 christdem.15.d:0 "Finally, after much stalling, the Fronte Democratico has given us the answer to our plea for help. Their response, while not a refusal or acceptance of support, is a deal that if we add certain parts to the bill then they will vote for it and back our party. This was to be expected, as nobody in politics ever agrees to anything without some negotiations. It appears that every single one of their demands is simply taking one of our parts of the bill and making it far more extreme in liberalization and practice. For example, while we wish to enforce a mandatory education for all students, the liberals would have us also put in place a common curriculum that ensures the children have a full and regimented education. That is one of the more mild requests, with some even asking that we include funding and resources for completely unrelated areas like subsidies for university students and grants for research. While many of these preliminary demands will be rendered null with a bit of negotiation, the fact stands that we will have to alter and add reforms to the bill if we wish to gain the support of the Fronte Democratico when we vote. Leadership of the Christian Democrat party however is urging caution, as fulfilling their demands too much will both make us look weak and make us lose the support of moderate-right deputies that have so far aligned with us."
 christdem.15.a:0 "All that matters is that we pass this bill!"

 christdem.16.t:0 "Voting Begins on the Moro Reform"
 christdem.16.d:0 "The Chamber is buzzing with activity, as today is the day that the deputies vote on the first major bill to be introduced into a democratic Italy. The Delegated Decrees on Schooling, the bill designed to improve educational standards and general quality of life in the nation, has been highly contentious and many are wondering if it will be able to pass through with enough votes to become law.\nMoro has been in a generally good mood, and while anxious at the prospect of having his first piece of legislation be a failure, is in high hopes and good spirits. Upon being questioned by a reporter as to his expectations, he responded by announcing that he expects many Italian politicians will be able to spot the merit in the bill and will put aside partisan squabbling to pass it, as the common interest amongst them is to help the people, not hinder them. However, it is well known that this bill's death would spell doom for both Moro and the Democrazia Cristiana, and being unable to pass legislation would inevitably lead to them losing the next elections.\nNo matter if the votes are in our favor or not, the populace will be watching us and responding appropriately to the results. Now we can only hold our breath and pray for good fortune."

Behind the scenes, talks of armed intervention began to conspire. Duce Almirante, fearing to let paranoia lead to his fall, chose not to investigate the rumors.\n\nThis morning forces of the Carabinieri stormed both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

Io ti- AAH!" another scream, this time from the woman's foot coming in contact with Lorenzo's private areas once. Then twice. Then in the stomach. When the man was curled on the floor, holding his head, Margherita Varesini calmly went to her room, took her only bag, and returned to her husband, still on the floor. "Lorenzo, I'm joining the army. Pray they don't give me a weapon, or you will be my first target. Goodbye!" and then Margherita Izzo left the house, smiling."

But it cost them all economic ties with Germany in the process, with predictable consequences for Romania's fragile economy.\n\nAfter young King Michael took power from Ion Antonescu's Iron Guard, the country has experienced a normalisation in politics, which we can exploit in our favour: a diplomatic mission should immediately be sent to Bucharest to discuss the terms of closer relationships between our countries, especially against German aggression."

It will be a trifle to finance a thorough prospecting campaign across Romania, finding the best places to establish a new ENI subsidiary dedicated to extracting oil in the Ploesti oil fields and nearby lands.

Despite the regime's apparent stability in Budapest, terrorists and partisans control the countryside, and the German population plots to rejoin the fatherland: it's only a matter of time before the country collapses into anarchy.\n\nIn this political chaos, however, there's a hope for stability: Istvàn Horthy, son of the previous Regent, is well-respected by the population, and has moderate views which, with enough time and "convincing", could easily turn into a newfound love for democracy. We should covertly fund the son of the "Admiral without a Navy", and ensure he comes out of the imminent showdown on top..."

But chaos has broken out across the Middle East starting with a civil war in Yemen, and the rebellious fever has spread to Egypt and Syria. Some of these demagogues and renegades are fueled by religious zeal, others by dreams of a single state for the entire Arab world, and others still by simple anti-Monarchist sentiment.

A failure here will lose us the support of our only stable ally in the region and discredit us globally.

And now that they have feasted on the corpses of Switzerland and Sweden, they are turning their gaze down to the south. We need to remain calm. Switzerland and Sweden were no Italy, they lacked the overseas empire that we do, the population, the industry, the military strength, and the national will to resist invasion.

This means training them to think quickly and independently, to excel in close quarters and house-to-house fighting.

Like an orchestra, the successful carrying out of the mission will result in a harmony where the subgroups compliment and amplify the results of the others until it is art. The art of economy has not been given its rightful status compared to its cousins, but we will change that, we will be artists sculpting a new Italy."

We shall uplift the dedicated, the worthy, the patriots. We shall push aside the corrupt, the greedy, the capitalists.

The original draft of the Carta del Lavoro gave far too much power to the industrialists and big business executives. They have used this power to abuse their workers, as well pursuing interests that do not necessarily coincide with those of the Italian nation.\n\nDuce Scorza has decided that the time has come to revise the Carta del Lavoro and update it for the present day. This new Charter of Labour shall restrict the powers of the business elite over their workers, so that unbridled capitalism shall no longer run roughshod over the working Italian. Those who put in a fair day's labour shall receive the compensation and benefits that they are entitled to. The average Italian has placed his trust in the state, and the state shall not betray that trust any longer!\n\nNot only that, but all these corporations shall no longer be allowed to solely pursue their own goals, even if that means working against the goals of the state. Given that the state provides plenty of support to these corporations, it is only natural that they should in turn be supporting the state, working towards our goals rather than just their bottom line. The business executives may protest us revising the Carta Del Lavoro, but hard luck on them. If they had not abused the trust the state had in them, this would not be necessary to begin with!"

More money in one's pocket tends to lead to happiness.\n\nHowever, despite our successes at ending taxation, there still seem to be a few issues. The central problem that we face comes from economists. They seem to mistakenly believe that the Italian Government is too centered around taxation, and that even individual spending can't maintain it. Even more, they think that this rapid abolishment will lead to hyper-inflation and a total economic collapse! What fools they are. It's clear to everyone with a brain that an excess of money can only lead to more spending, which is the driver of economic prowess!

The bankers and economists are chuckling from their ivy towers as Inflation spikes, businesses and consumers alike desperately attempt to spend their savings before they become worthless, and the economy as a whole approaches absolute meltdown.\n\nPerhaps we've merely misinterpreted the instructional texts from early Fascism, which are notoriously self-contradictory and vague. Already, the best minds from the PNF are working to figure out a solution in line with Fascist ideology and the glorious thought of il duces Mussolini and Scorz.\n\nWell we have no doubt that Fascism will prove itself in time, for now it appears to the public like the naysayers have had the last last. As the nation sinks ever further into crisis, and even some within the hallowed halls of the Italian government show signs of doubting the Fascist way, we can only hope that a solution will be found quickly.\n\nOr failing that, an "interpretation" which allows us to undo our recent decision making, temporarily of course."

Justas we ignored these fools in the forging our empire, we ignored them in the implementation of Mussolini's vision, confident that the fascist way would prove right in time.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that we were wrong.\n\nOur attempts to forge a new and more productive cooperative arrangement between Workers and managers has done nothing but alienate both of them. The beautiful future we worked so hard to build appears to have been nothing but a delusion, and all of the blood, toil, tears and sweat that we sacrificed to build it were for nothing.\n\nEven now, as our factories are filled with strikes and sabotage, and the wealthy flee our nation for friendlier climates there are those who still believe in Fascism. Maybe we should too. Afterall, sending in the Blackshirts to simply solve the problem with blood and bullets might not be the most "humane situation" (or the most in linew ith Fascist doctrine) but it'd certainly be easier than making the painful adjustments to our structures and ideology admitting failure would entail.\n\nOn the other had, perhaps its best to accept defeat, admit that we failed, and change for the better. After all, if Fascism does not serve the Italian Nation and the Italian Worker, who does it serve?

The office was silent, the only sound coming from the regular typing of Scorza's private secretary. Sipping from another cup of coffee, Scorza wondered how to protect Italy from the next storm, one which could potentially be even more devastating than the last war and Atlantropa put together.

Perhaps he couldn't influence the way the crisis would start, but surely he could erect walls, shore up the defences so that the country might survive the storm!

But, he wondered, how was this goal, the refinement of Fascism, to be achieved? The old systems have been rotting away for decades, ever since Mussolini, yes, but what was to be done?\n\nFor Scorza to repair the cracking foundation of Italy and the Party, radical action would have to be taken, and quickly.

The old systems that had defined what "Fascism" is were simply untenable, and foundational change would need to occur if Italy was to survive the storm of the Oil Crisis, and the rapidly shifting world around them. Quickly getting to work, he began to draft the ideas that would define this "New Fascism."\n\nThe first order of business: the Electoral System. The people, as so many had tended to find out, tend to be much more content when they truly feel they are represented in their governance. True universal suffrage was impossible, yes, but the "democracy" of the Empire could certainly be expanded to meet the needs of the people. Second, of course, was the welfare of the people. Although he would have to create an extensive plan for the welfare of Italy yet, the people must enjoy a basic level of comfortable living standards for them to be content. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the State would be required to subscribe to the pillars of true Fascism in full, and every hint of corruption, disloyalty, and treason purged with overwhelming power. After all, these reforms Scorza was now rapidly fabricating in his mind were constructed with a singular purpose in mind: ensuring that the truest, most best form of Fascism can truly last for a thousand years more, and absolutely nothing can stand in his way. Even the King would have to be subdued eventually, but that would have to come for the future. Grabbing the nearest writing utensil, he began to dilegently work on perfecting this "New Fascism."\n\nAnd as the sun finally began to dawn on Italy once more, Scorza laid down his pen.

Fascism had reigned in Italy for 70 years, and it must go on to live one thousand years more!\n\nThe feebleminded, traitorous elements of society, however, were moving against him, he knew; rumors of dicontent had been circling throughout Rome for years, but they had reached a tee with the advent of the Oil Crisis. The liberals, the Bolsheviks, and all those who wish to destroy Italy - they must be eredicated with the utmost strength and speed available to the Duce. Even the King had always been silent protest of Scorza's triumphs - he too, must be bent to the Duce's will.\n\nScorza knew, however, that he was getting old. Eventually, a succesor would be needed, but that was for the future to hold.\n\nGrabbing the nearest writing utensil, Scorza began to plot out the machinians of the reinforcement of Fascism.\n\nAnd as the sun finally began to dawn on Italy once more, Scorza laid down his pen. The vibrantly orange sun nearly blinding him as he stood from his finely-crafted chair, he finally had concocted his final plan."

The powers at bay let Fascism slide into decay, into rot, and perhaps most egregiously, they have allowed for Fascism to stray far from the very core foundations of our nation!\n\nWith the sudden rise of Scorzo, however, this shall be no longer - we shall finally perfect Fascism to be the best, most truthful form of itself.

The greatest threats to Italy are not subversive ideologies, but the yawning chasm of dysfunction, corruption, and self-interest that plagues the PNF and the institutions of the Italian state.

Many of its members view their membership in the party as a means to advance their personal interests, and not as service to the Italian nation.\n\nThis rot is undermining the Italian people's confidence in the fascist project and the PNF's authority, and if it is not checked, it will transform Italy into a mirror of the German Reich. To save the PNF from itself, Scorza will authorize the OVRA to conduct a thorough investigation into corruption in the party.

Over the decades, a seedy network of shady transactions and dark money has enabled special interests to possess vast influence over the state. The web of corruption stretches from the highest ministers to the lowest clerks, and dismantling it will be a tall order.\n\nThere is no question that it must be done.

There are countless members of the Chruch who have engaged in all sorts of corrupt and debauched behavior, from bribery and fornication to even homosexuality or pedophilia.\n\nMussolini always enjoyed it when an OVRA agent would bring to his desk yet another report on a cleric's dirty deeds, and Scorza feels that this practice should continue.

Italy has changed, and our ability to directly control the State has certainly suffered as a result.\n\nFascism has changed, but we will never forget the founding tenets of Mussolini - reform was necessary to maintain the core foundation of the State, and through our targeted efforts, we have achieved it.\n\nThe hardliners grumble, the reformists cheer, and the people are content with the state of the Italian government. This may not have been the easiest path to go down, but it seems that it was the right one."

Fascsicm is now ever so impenetrable, and the road to success has been paved with victories over those who wished to destroy us. Foreign influence in the population has been purged, while the outside view of our state grows ever more favorable. The Party has been put under the influence, if not direct control, of the Duce. We trod on the path set by the ones before us, and we use their foundation to create the prime example of Fascism in display.\n\nMany wonder if we could have done more for Italy - taken more radical action, more extreme changes. Their concerns are of no importance to us.\n\nAfter all, things change for them to stay the same."

As must be natural with any political entity ruling over a sufficiently diverse collection of peoples and conquered territories, cohesion is limited at best. While nominally under the same government, an Imperial citizen living in Naples would likely find himself completely lost in Dubai, or even the more integrated Benghazi. The issue of how to better bring these disparate groups and former nations under one flag will no doubt take a good deal of effort and patience, but achieving the desired unity will likely bring immense reward."

Just as the Fasci is the collection of many thin sticks into one unbreakable, intractable bundle, so too will our empire bind and merge the collective wills and dreams of all our subjects under the banner of one state.

The Nazis may be so short sighted and stubborn to take all who are worth taking based on their own racial theories but the true and modern Fascist state is under no such illogical constraints.

They do not deserve public office, or any benefits that the state can provide, for these belong to true citizens. We understand that the Germans do not view us as true Aryans but this is simply their desire to keep all to themselves.

Those who would seek to dissuade us from such a path reveal themselves as either cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Look at what the Germans accomplished! While Ciano persuaded Mussolini to follow more high minded ideals the Reich swallowed almost all of Europe and Africa, leaving us with the scraps.

Perhaps the Arabs should be next on our list, or German refugees from the Civil War? Whatever we decide upon, we can quickly begin to distribute learning materials to all of our citizens that show just what a threat to the Italian way of life that group is.

Fascism after all, is a state focused ideology first and foremost, and if the state is being held back by outdated beliefs then it is within the power of Fascism to throw them out. In the circles of the Italian government, it is called the "Political Absolute" for it is the one true metric through which everything must be judged through."

Their utter abjection, a tragedy to the French people, may yet prove to be beneficial to Italian interests. We may choose to pursue a policy of cooperation with the government in Bordeaux, helping the regime build up to our benefit and bringing them into the Italian sphere.

We must finish modernizing agriculture, and tap into the wealth of industry that Italy holds. Of course, our infrastructure will be built up even more to support the increased amount of materials that will soon flow through Italy.

While it was successful at greatly increasing production of necessary foodstuffs, it also led to the decline of major Italian exports such as cheese and wine. While it is becoming clear that we must fight a Second Battle for Grain, we must strike a balance. Old farms shall be rejuvenated from near-death, land shall be cleared for new farms, and we shall provide these new farms with modern agricultural equipment! Of course, we will also remind the established farmers that there is much money to be made in not just grain or cereal, but in the finer luxuries.

However, not all of Italian agriculture is mechanized. There are still people who use horses to farm, and the idea of things such as tractors are far-fetched to them. Thankfully, there are only a few farms that have not been mechanized, so a push to finish modernizing agriculture shouldn't be too expensive. Finishing this modernization of Italian agriculture will be critical to helping advance the Italian economy into the modern era.\n\nOf course, we will not merely uplift those who do not have agricultural technology. We will also help the farmers who have already adopted mechanized agriculture by helping them obtain the newest equipment and tractors, and by teaching them the newest agricultural techniques. These efforts may not be the cheapest, but the returns will greatly outweigh the costs!"

Many Italian railways are beginning to age, and there are too many steam locomotives still in use, especially when diesel and electric trains are objectively superior. We must rectify this issue by modernizing our railway system and by phasing out the old trains. Of course, we cannot focus purely on trains if we are modernizing infrastructure. The Italian roads, the pride and glory of the old Roman Empire, must be modernized as well. New roads shall be built across the Adriatic salt flats, and existing roads shall be upgraded to reflect a new and modern Italy.

Our economy prospers for the first time in years, and while we may never be number one, being as high up as number four is an impressive achievement. Italy has finally begun to assert itself globally as not the sidekick of the Germans or the leader of the Triumvirate, but as a strong and prosperous nation. God willing, we will stay this powerful for a long time."

However, its implementation by Mussolini did not hold true to the spirit of 'true' fascism, and as a result, the system began to slowly become corrupted and rotten over time. It ended up becoming no better than the corrupt capitalist system it replaced, with many Italians still chafing under a corrupt system that cares not for the average Italian.\n\nNo more! Today, Duce Scorza shall speak before the Grand Council of Fascism to announce a new plan to 'correct' the course of fascism. 'True' fascism, he argues, has never been properly tried, but that changes now! With a particular emphasis on vast government welfare programmes, aimed at lifting Italians out of poverty, the Duce shall set forth his grand vision for a newer, stronger, and healthier fascism, and Italy, for the modern era!"

 ita_another_round_of_reforms_desc:0 "Duce Scorza has outlined his vision for a newer, truer fascism. Now it is time to get to work implementing it! The Duce has drafted a sweeping new reform programme to aid poor Italians. As for how the aid to these poor Italians will be implemented, it consists of four main prongs.\n\nFirstly, pensions for elderly Italians, with particular emphasis on veterans who so valiantly served Italy during the war. Secondly, the urban unemployed, of whom there are far too many in Italy's great cities. Thirdly, the rural poor, who struggle to get by despite being the ones to feed Italy. And finally, women, of whom far too many are working to support their families out of necessity to get by.\n\nIt is a truly ambitious programme, and the Duce will likely have to step on a few toes to get it all implemented. But who said it would be easy?"

Aimed at providing social security to elderly Italians, it clearly isn't doing the job we need it to do, considering far too many elderly Italians struggle to get by in what should be their golden years.\n\nThis ends now. Duce Scorza has demanded a tremendous increase in funding for the INPS, so that every elderly person in Italy can live their retirement at ease. In particular, extra pensions will be given to those who have demonstrated loyalty to the party and country, whether it be by serving in the party itself, the Blackshirts, or otherwise. We will make it known that if you do your part for the government, the government will do its part for you when you're old!"

Prevention is the best cure, as they say.\n\nNot only will unemployment subsidies be increased, but vast make-work programmes shall be implemented. The best way to alleviate unemployment is, well, employment, after all!\n\nNow, some of our critics say these programmes are 'inefficient', and do not address the root of the problem.

And yet, far too many rural Italians live in crushing poverty, despite their importance to Italy's economy and society. This is completely unacceptable, and Duce Scorza knows it!\n\nThat is why the Duce has developed an extensive rural assistance programme, aimed at fixing this great injustice. Rural families will be provided with financial assistance, tax cuts, competitive advantages, and all manner of boons to ensure that they can live the life they deserve to live!\n\nNot only that, but there's something in it for us, too! The rural poor will remember how we came to their rescue, and they will no doubt recognize that it is the PNF on whom they depend for this assistance. They will reward us with their loyalty.

Due to the unfortunate economic conditions, many Italian women are putting off marriage and motherhood in favor of work! This shall not do at all. Duce Scorza shall rectify this problem twofold.\n\nFirstly, he will sex up tax barriers to dissuade women from seeking jobs; the most important job they can have is that of a mother, after all. Secondly, he will reward women who become mothers by providing them with all manner of benefits, tax credits, and subsidies. And those benefits will only increase the more children they have!

It will contain details of further reforms that the Duce has planned, all in the name of restoring fascism to its original intent and true form.\n\nThis manifesto and the proposed reforms therein will undoubtedly ruffle the feathers of the establishment.

Since 1939, there have been no direct elections to the legislature; instead, all the members have been appointed from members of the PNF, as well as representatives from the various trades and corporations that make up the Italian economy.\n\nWell, Duce Scorza has changes planned. Whilst he will not go as far as restoring popular suffrage for the entire chamber, what he WILL do is make it so that workers can directly elect their own representatives to the chamber. After all, we cannot necessarily trust corporate managers to adequately represent the needs of their workers.

After their term is up, the Duce will be required to step aside, with their successor to be chosen by the Grand Council of Fascism.\n\nThis idea is not entirely without precedent. Mussolini himself toyed with the idea, but ultimately decided not to implement it. However, this will undoubtedly be a tough sell to PNF High Command. But Duce Scorza will assure them of the necessity, in order to keep any one person from consolidating too much power for too long, and thus corrupting the fascist system."

Duce Scorza will not go as far as to restore popular suffrage. However, he will greatly loosen the restrictions on who can run for the legislature. Under these new reforms, any member of the PNF will be able to run for office. This will make it so rank and file PNF members shall have a voice, not just the top of the party!"

Citing Rossoni as an inspiration, the Duce has announced new industrial and labor laws for Italy's factories.

 ## BOE EVENTS

 ITABOE.1.t:0 "Brawling in Basic"
 ITABOE.1.d:0 "Despite the military's best attempt at maintaining a détente between the royalist and fascist elements of the officer class, the same cannot be said about the rank-and-file. Italy's sons from all walks of life proudly serve in the Army, which means that there is a high chance of soldiers finding out their bunkmate professes some... interesting political theories.\n\nSuch was the case today in a training camp outside of Napoli, where these tensions came to a boiling point and devolved into physical violence. According to the officers' reports, one of the cadets noticed that someone had moved a portrait of the Duce on the wall so that it sits above that of the King. When he loudly demanded to know who did it, the offending cadet proudly stood up and took responsibility. The argument quickly grew heated, punches were thrown, and their squadmates jumped into the fray. While the military police were quickly called to defuse the situation and arrest the instigators, the story has spread rapidly, with some alterations. Fascists are painting it as a brave patriot standing up to a subversive conspiracy, while monarchists insist it was the work of a treasonous cur with no respect for tradition. The government needs to take a stance on the issue, and soon."
 ITABOE.1.a:0 "We are still a monarchy, no?"
 ITABOE.1.b:0 "No man is equal to the Duce!"
 ITABOE.1.c:0 "Why should we care about interior decoration?"

 ITABOE.2.t:0 "What's In A Name?"
 ITABOE.2.d:0 "The Regia Marina, our Royal Navy, has proudly patrolled the Mediterranean and defended the shores of our Patria for a century. Many are proud to say they serve, but some are less proud than others. Not because they hate the sea or their homeland, but because of its name. Specifically, the fact that it is the Royal Navy.\n\nA group of very ideologically motivated submarine captains have begun circulating a letter among their comrades, one that descries the monarchist implications of the Regia Marina's name. They accuse it of every single ideological crime under the sun, from undermining sailors' morale to encouraging anti-fascist partisan activity. The letter concludes with a demand that the name be changed "at the early possible convenience of the Grand Council," urging them to "remember that this is the navy of the Italian people and Empire, not a lone Savoyard!" While nobody in the Grand Council has any serious designs to change the Regia Marina's name, some form of response is expected."
 ITABOE.2.a:0 "Dismiss this silly petition at once."
 ITABOE.2.b:0 "Promise to consider it at some point."

 ITABOE.3.t:0 "Hands Down"
 ITABOE.3.d:0 "During a state dinner attended by Prince Ferdinando, duke of Genoa, Prince Filiberto, duke of Pistoia, and Prince Eugenio, duke of Ancona, as well as many members of the military's high command, counter admiral Borghese caused quite a diplomatic stir when he saluted and shook hands with Princes Ferdinando and Filiberto upon their arrival, but conspicuously only shook the hand of Prince Eugenio. When questioned by one of his fellow generals about the action, Borghese replied, "The Prince is only a colonel. In what world should a counter admiral be expected to salute his subordinates?"\n\nNeedless to say, this was not received very well by the rest of the officer corps, and Edgardo Sogno, also present at the dinner, has led the charge in demanding Borghese receive some form of censure for his insubordination. Although Borghese will not receive anything more severe than a slap on the wrist regardless of the outcome-he is too strategically vital-an official stance needs to be taken on whether nobility in the military should receive the same honors as those at the top of the normal hierarchy."
 ITABOE.3.a:0 "He should've shown more respect to his betters."
 ITABOE.3.b:0 "Salute the rank, not the name."

 ita_centrosinistra_organico_desc:0 "Finally, the talks are over, and we can proudly say that our center-left coalition, the Centro Sinistra Organico, is revved up and ready to go! The program has been finalised, and the parliamentary agenda is being minutely drawn so that none has the suspicion of being sidelined in favour of the other. With our large numbers, we can safely approve our reforms without fear of "franchi tiratori": the BN and the PSI may scream from their extremist positions, but that's all they can do to disturb us.\n\nWho knows, perhaps this is the start of something more than a mere alliance of convenience? Only time and politics will tell..."

 ita_enact_the_agenda_desc:0 "With the legislature in full swing, the government's agenda is seeing its first reforms approved: as a show of good will towards the FD, we will start by establishing the foundation of a proper welfare system for the poor and downtrodden. While this will be costly for our finances, we can't deny that there's a dire need for those subsidies, especially since the economic crisis that followed the Atlantropa disaster - damn Germans - is still plaguing the country with its last ugly tendrils.\n\nMoro and Nenni will hold a joint press conference to illustrate the new welfare system and how it will help out those who still live without a job, further increasing the government's popularity in the eyes of the common people."

 ita_long_term_plans_desc:0 "The IRI is the most important tool at our disposal to influence Italy's economy, and to ensure that smaller business fall in line with our proposed economic reforms: with its gargantuan budget and its connections in every possible facet of the economy, the IRI is sorely needed, now more than ever, to finally draw up a comprehensive, long-term oriented, strategy to bring the Italian economy completely out of stagnation.\n\nOur Minister for the Economy and Finances has scheduled a series of regular meetings with the IRI's board of directors, so that this immensely complex plan can actually be drawn up, and one day become reality: should it actually work, its benefits for the economy will be immense, creating jobs for the people and badly needed revenue for the State."

 ita_rise_of_the_cooperative_desc:0 "Cooperatives have been a staple of leftist narrative of the economy: in a cooperative, there's no "owner", as the workers themselves own the business and organise it according to their own desires and plans, dividing the earnings equally between every worker. As it is one of the less-radical reforms proposed by the FD, the government has decided to draft laws which officially recognise cooperatives, giving them incentives and tax exemptions to help them establish a starting presence in the Italian economy.\n\nWhile it's unlikely cooperatives will supplant the traditional business model, it will be a way to ensure better equality and fairer competition in the cut-throat economic world."
 
 ita_establish_the_regioni:0 "Establish the Regioni"
 ita_establish_the_regioni_desc:0 "After Italy was united, it was decided to keep the administrative units small, establishing only the Comuni, cities, and Province, small unions of comuni, due to the risk of uprising from those still loyal to the old pre-unitary States. Now that Italy is properly united, and none wishes to secede to form the old Grand-Duchy of Tuscany or other nonsensical "nations", we can finally implement the final stage of the administration.\n\nThe Regioni will encompass provinces united by a common heritage, and ensure that the government's policies can be applied uniformly without the need to micromanage hundreds of small bodies: of course, this will entail a certain degree of decentralisation, as the Regioni will have minor legislative powers of their own, something which may greatly enrage the more authoritarian forces within the parliament, but it is an overall sound proposal, especially in the light of the future reforms we have in mind."
 
 ita_an_empowered_parliament:0 "An Empowered Parliament"
 ita_an_empowered_parliament_desc:0 "Even though Italy has become a proper democracy, the parliament's powers are still vaguely defined, especially in the light of the government's powers still granted by the old fascist laws. Our allies in the FD wish to properly and officially state that Italy is a parliamentary democracy, and that it is the parliament - and not the government - to decide the country's policies.\n\nSince this is exactly what we want, and the King is only too happy to promulgate such a law, we will immediately send the draft to His Majesty for a preliminary evaluation, and then the votations will begin in the parliament. With this reform, the last vestiges of fascism will be blown away by the winds of democracy!"
 
 ita_unity_is_strength:0 "통합이 힘이다"
 ita_unity_is_strength_desc:0 "In 1920, democracy fell apart because the democratic forces were too divided to offer a joint resistance against Mussolini's March on Rome: we were too busy backstabbing each other, and even experienced politicians such as Giolitti thought they could use fascists to further their own goals. Of course, this backfired spectacularly...\n\nNow, however, we have learnt the harsh lesson with forty years of dictatorship, and we won't make the same mistake twice! It is the burden of good men and women to always stand vigilant against those who would take away their freedom and their loved ones. Therefore, all Italians who truly believe in democracy should unite under our government, to safely transition towards true democratic rule, and forever banish the taint of fascism so that it never comes back to haunt our existences as it did before."
