 ita.1.t:0 "The Situation of the Italian Empire"
 ita.1.d:0 "Italy's great gains in the Second World War seemed to promise a new awakening to the broken kingdom. Along with Germany, Italy would ascend to the ranks of global superpowers, masters of the world, the largest empire known since Rome, spanning Algeria to Syria, the Alps to the Horn of Africa. Yet fate is a wind, a gale that changes course at the slightest provocation. When Germany strongarmed Italy into agreeing with the Atlantropa project, the aging Duce Mussolini correctly predicted that the end of the friendship that had conquered Europe, Africa, and Asia was past it's time. The final straw came when the Germans, assailed on what seemed like every side by the resurgent Russians, attempted to force Italy into a war it had no part in. In a fury, Mussolini severed remaining ties with Germany, and as a final insult to Hitler, opened the Empire's borders to Jews, Roma, and any other 'undesirables' hunted by the Nazis.\n\nYet not all was well within the Empire. As the Duce aged, his mind grew more and more erratic, and the Empire nearly fell into infighting as Mussolini privately declared his plans to abolish the monarchy to his son in law, Galeazzo Ciano. Ciano proved himself a hero of the Empire when, against all odds, he convinced the Duce to spare the King, ensuring stability. Not a year later, the Duce died. Galeazzo Ciano was thus sworn in as Duce, and nearly immediately began to liberalize the country, pulling it away from the path Mussolini had taken it.\n\nThough a dedicated fascist, Ciano is an Italian first, and has claimed to recognize the failures within fascism, and promises reforms. Reformists see him as a democrat bringing down a corrupt system from within, moderates see him as a pragmatic fascist doing whatever it takes to keep his home alive, and hardliners, lead by the ideologue Carlo Scorza, see him as a traitor to their ideals.\n\nThe Empire stands on a precipice. Will Ciano succeed in his reforms and bring freedom to the people that demand it so, or will Scorza win out in the end, strengthening Fascism's grip over Italy?\n\nThe winds of fate have left Italy at a crossroads. Whether they take Ciano's road or Scorza's, the country must move forward."

 ita.2.d:0 "The government announced this morning that Duce Galeazzo Ciano has personally left Rome in order to attend this years Malta Conference. While in the past he would have simply sent a represenative, current tensions at home and abroad convinced him of the need to personally attend.\n\nMany in the international community spectulate that this is due to the rise in popularity of Carlo Scorza, who has proven himself an able adversary for the long time leader. Many speculate that Ciano is hopeful that a favorable resolution to the congress will revive popular support for his government."

All of these titles and more have been on the front page of nearly every Italian newspaper, the story they tell is largely the same. Natives being brutalized, worked to death, starved, all while being watched by our viceroy to East Africa Enrico Mattei.\n\nThe public is outraged by this news, with anti-imperialist protestors and students taking to the streets to demand the removal of Mattei. Even his former allies in the party seem to have abandoned him, with one anonymous member saying "most of the party had known that Mattei was a little too ambitious and ruthless for his own good, but we never imagined he was capable of this."\n\nWith pressure mounting, and the demonstrations starting to turn violent, we need to decide whether or not to do anything about this."

 ita.6.d:0 "It was a hot and dry day like any other, when the Libyans reached the Levant. The nature of their deployment, and the oppertunity it offered for propaganda meant that they where personally met by Governor-General dalla Chiesa. As he wrapped up his address to them, he left the stage to personally speak with the volunteers. Just when it seemed that the event was over, a soldier approached him.\n\n"Hello there, General dalla Chiesa, it's a pleasure to finally meet you in person". Chiesa turned to look at the voice, a fresh faced young soldier, who's accented Italian easily revealed that he was of native Libyan descent.\n\nHe nodded in response, and asked the soldier why he had decided to volunteer for the war. The soldier smiled before answering "To do the job that only we arabs can do, sending the Turks packing out of Arabia" Dalla Chiesa stared at the man for a second, shocked that anyone would take that sort of tone with an officer. After a moment, he smiled, before asking the soldiers name.\n\n"Gaddafi sir, Capitano Muammar Gaddafi""

 ita.17.t:0 "Violence in Palestine"
 ita.17.d:0 "The region of Palestine has always been a troublesome spot for the Italian empire. Being the site of Jewish settlement since the time of the British empire, ethnic tensions in the region have been building up, with the Native Arabs resenting the presence of these new arrivals, who they see as intruders to there home. The jews meanwhile, having suffered in the hands of the Germans and there puppet regimes, want nothing more then to find a new place to call home, and will be up in arms to defend this right. The situation is reaching a breaking point, and unless we take a side, the situation will spiral out of control.\n\nTo this end, we are presented with two opetions. We can either agree to the Arabs demands and close any further settlements. While this will certainly placate the Arabs, we are not sure if it will be enough pacify them. As well as this, the Jews already living in Palestine will certainly not take kindly to this.\n\nSiding with the Israelis on the other hand and telling the Arabs to back off will certainly earn us there ire. While this makes our intents of Jewish nation in Palestine clear, the ractions to this will certainly be varied, and mostl ikely not entirely positive. Whichever path we choose, troubles are certain to arise, as they always have."

#Scorza Crackdown Events#
 scorza.2.t:0 "A Meeting With General dalla Chiesa"
 scorza.2.d:0 "When the war-hero Generale dalla Chiesa was called into the office of Il Duce, Carlo Scorza, he had no clue what he was to be tasked with. After dalla Chiesa saluted his leader and was allowed a seat in one of the luxurious armchairs across the grand desk, he was immediately subjected to a rant about loyalty to Italy and the Fascist Party. He described to dalla Chiesa how as they speak, party traitors are planning a meeting in the city of Verona, a so-called Second Verona Conference, in which they will conspire to overthrow him and push Italy into degeneracy. As he spoke, Scorza went from calm to almost seething with rage as he slammed his fists against his desk. He then gave a simple order to the uneasy general; an order to end this convention through the use of military force by any means necessary. Scorza soon dismissed dalla Chiesa with a proud salute, calling him a trusted friend and loyal patriot.\n\nAs dalla Chiesa left the building, he couldn't help but question the sanity of the order and of Il Duce himself. However, he quickly decided that such thoughts were treasonous, as it was his duty to fulfill the orders to the end. After all, politics is for the politicians and obedience is the role of the army. With that out of mind, he began developing his strategy for eliminating the traitors. After the conference in Verona begins, an armoured military division, veterans of the war with Turkey, will arrive into the town and place it under martial law. Hopefully, they will be able to quickly find the perpetrators, who will be dealt with soon after. Dalla Chiesa sent his plan out to his subordinates that afternoon, while also sending a message to Scorza promising a quick and easy end to the enemies of Italy."
 scorza.2.a:0 "Yes Sir!"
 scorza.3.t:0 "The Descent Into Verona"
 scorza.3.d:0 "The Italian soldiers of the 133rd Armoured Division Littorio wait on the outskirts of Verona, ready to move in whenever the order is given. Although they are preparing to go into an Italian city, they see it as no different from the small villages in the Middle East which they so recently ravaged. They are here, not to protect the people, or to keep peace, but to annihilate the enemies of Il Duce and those who dare defy his authority. The false fascists that flock to the city are nothing more than treasonous rats, ready to be exterminated by the heroes of the empire.\n\nAll of a sudden, the orders are given, and the veteran soldiers begin their march into the streets of Verona. They are escorted by the finest tanks and armoured cars available to the empire, armed with the most modern firearms, and carrying enough ammunition to last a hundred sieges. As they enter the city, families shut their doors, shops close, and mothers herd their children inside in fear of trouble to come. They are only greeted by a small group of policemen who try futilely to deny them entry, claiming the army was violating their jurisdiction, only to be beaten and arrested. The soldiers soon reach the center of the town, and as if in some statement of their authority, set up their headquarters in Castelvecchio, or the old castle, which acted as a military fortress in the Middle Ages. The mayor of Verona, after receiving a personal letter from Il Duce himself, has given a speech to the residents announcing that the army is taking control in order to promote safety, and must be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\n\nHe was found dead the next day, the official cause being traitors poisoning his wine."
 scorza.3.a:0 "For Il Duce!"
 scorza.4.t:0 "The Streets of Rage"
 scorza.4.d:0 "The soldiers of the 133rd have had more and more trouble simply maneuvering the streets of Verona due to massive amounts of protesters blocking their path. The foot troops have much difficulty trying to march, and the tanks and trucks have been sitting still for hours. The protesters, who appear to be mostly young adults and students, are against the army imposing martial law in the city. By blocking their movement with barricades and their own bodies, the students believe that they can stall the soldiers for just long enough that Rome would recall them out of frustration.\n\nThey were wrong\n\nBy now, the soldiers were getting annoyed. As they became restless, the officers in command began rationalizing that the protesters were just as traitorous as the men they were brought here to put down, so the students must be treated as enemies of the state. Soon after such discussion, the citizens that were safe behind locked doors gasped as they witnessed hundreds of their fellow Italians being beaten senseless by the aggravated infantrymen. Tanks roared to life, unafraid of rolling over anybody foolish enough to stand in their way and advanced forward. No one stands in their way anymore, and the occupiers are now free to fulfill their duty to Italy and Il Duce."
 scorza.4.a:0 "Get Out of the Way!"
 scorza.5.t:0 "Capturing the University"
 scorza.5.d:0 "The University of Verona is the center for all young intellectuals in the city, and as such, represents a thorn in the military's side. After dealing with the protesters in the streets, it became evident that something drastic had to be done in order to end any opposition activity at once. So it has been decided that they shall march on the college and force the people that consider it a safe haven to see the might of Italy. As the trucks rolled out into the courtyard and the soldiers deployed in the hallways, the students actually attempted to put up a fight! By using stones and sticks, the young adults sought to deter the invasion. The soldiers responded by firing machine guns into the crowds, mowing down all who were foolish enough to oppose them. Even when they started to run, there was no mercy as the soldiers chased them down and either beat or shot them.\n\nUpon hearing the news of the capture, Scorza is said to have turned bright red, for the University of Verona was founded by him just a few years ago. Scorza soon ordered that the actions of the army be covered up by the media, as any knowledge of what happened would surely end with him being thrown out of office. But it had to be done, for the stability of Italy."
 scorza.5.a:0 "It was necessary..."
 scorza.6.t:0 "Dealing With the Survivors"
 scorza.6.d:0 "A few of the young protestors in the university have managed to barricade themselves in the dormitories, scared of facing justice. As they were called on to surrender, the cowards merely stayed silent. Therefore, it was decided to burn the building and shoot anybody who wants to escape.\n\nAs the flames burned and the residents screamed, the soldiers stood guard and watched. At this point, they realized that they were in a warzone, just like the Middle East. They were here to fight and to kill the enemies of Italy, and they were to go about it the only way they knew how. As the bodies roasted, the soldiers sang and lit cigarettes, utterly disregarding the hell around them."
 scorza.6.a:0 "They made their choice"
 scorza.7.t:0 "Crushing the Protestors"
 scorza.7.d:0 "Today the 133rd has reached another group of protestors who were trying to block the tanks and trucks with their bodies in a feeble attempt at resistance. As the weapons loaded and the soldiers faced the protestors with weapons at the ready, the young rebels didn't flinch. They held banners telling them to go home, and held torches that have began to symbolize the people of Verona who oppose the army's actions in the city. A standoff was taking shape, and as an officer warned the people to disperse, they simply yelled back petty insults. At this point, the officer gave up and ordered the 133rd to open fire.\n\nThe turrets of the tanks fired shells that destroyed buildings, and rifles cut down the screaming rioters. The protesters were cut down like wheat at the harvest. As the army advanced, they began firing at not just those with banners and torches, but anybody they came across. Everybody there became guilty of association, even children, and the punishment was death.\n\nAs news of these events reached the ears of city officials, they realized that the city really was a victim of invasion. As such, a secret order was passed down to muster a militia consisting of policemen, veterans, and young men to try and repel the occupiers. It was clear the military was seeking a fight, and Verona was prepared to give them one."
 scorza.7.a:0 "Open Fire"
 scorza.8.t:0 "Breaking Through"
 scorza.8.d:0 "The Second Verona Conference has began in a small bar in the center of town. The council of reformers, although scared for their lives, refused to cancel such an important event. And now they have the Verona militia guarding them, made up of young and old residents of the city who are armed with old rifles and makeshift explosives. If and when the army comes to put an end to the conference, they will have to battle the people of Italy who stand against tyranny and oppression. They will wage war with those they swore to protect, and they will spill the blood of their brothers.\n\nAs expected, the military came to put an end to the treason. And when they encountered an armed militia, they didn't even hesitate to put them down, each and every one. If a sniper was in an apartment, the tanks simply leveled the building. When an improvised explosive was encountered, they forced the onlooking civilians to walk through and clear the path. Even as the treasonous rats fired back and killed some of the brave sons of Italy, the soldiers only grew more angry. Entire stores burned, and ancient churches dating back hundreds of years crumbled into dust. The wrath of the 133rd was unmatched, and they slaughtered their way to the building where the true traitors lay, conspiring against Il Duce. There, they wait for the order to end this, once and for all."
 scorza.8.a:0 "Onward, we will make them pay"
 scorza.9.t:0 "At the council"
 scorza.9.d:0 "Even before the soldiers had knocked down the door and entered the meeting room, the council knew it was over for them. Some shot themselves like cowards, afraid of the justice they deserved, while others cried. When the traitors were confronted, however, they said nothing and did not try to escape or bargain. The army quickly apprehended them, only to discover that one had a bomb hidden under his coat, ready to deliver one last message of resistance. Luckily, fate blessed us this day and the explosive failed to go off. In order to make sure no such things happen again, the officers decided to forgo a trial and ordered a quick execution. They were left in the building as the soldiers barricaded the windows and exits and lit the building on fire. Forgetting that it was a bar, the army quickly departed as the alcohol caused a rapid combustion, leading to surrounding buildings burning. The flames spread and spread, and eventually most of Verona was aflame. The 133rd evacuated the area before any harm could come to them, and and one commander made a remark stating that the burning of Verona was justice for the city's betrayal of Scorza and Italy."
 scorza.9.a:0 "We did what was necessary..."
 scorza.10.t:0 "Opening Your Eyes"
 scorza.10.d:0 "As the fires burn on, everybody watches. The citizens of Verona weep, only able to run away, leaving their houses, jobs, and lives just to protect themselves. The city officials weep, unable to fight the fire as all resources and water systems are gone by the hands of the army. Even the soldiers, now able to see the hell that they have created, can no longer find justice in their actions. In Rome, the few high ranking government officials that have knowledge of the military's actions now see who Carlo Scorza is, and what his intentions are for Italy.\n\nAn anger is burning brighter than the flames engulfing Verona, as everybody who can see the reality of what happened now boil with rage. The false dictator who labels himself Il Duce is nothing more than a coward, and his actions have seen nothing but pain and suffering. His opponents will remember this. The soldiers will remember this. The victims will remember this."
 scorza.10.a:0 "All of this... This was Scorza's fault!"
 scorza.11.t:0 "The End"
 scorza.11.d:0 "The fires have died out, and two thirds of the city is now ash. Even before the flames died, all sorts of government workers have flooded the area under the guise of humanitarian work. The truth is, they are mostly fabricating excuses and creating stories to justify the disaster and the numerous massacres committed by the Italian military.\n\nRome's official response to the international outcry has been that the city was plotting against the state and Il Duce, and as such, had to be put down. When the army came to enforce the peace, the civilian population rose up and declared rebellion. The military acted justly and with proper authority in handling traitors to the state.\n\nBut regardless of opinions, speeches, or the lies of Scorza, the truth can be found in the hundreds of butchered citizens and thousands of burned bodies buried in the rubble. The orphaned children and abandoned hospital patients could speak of the terrible atrocity committed by their own people, if only anybody would listen. However, it appears that they shall remain buried, looked over, and neglected by a blind populace and a cruel dictator."
 scorza.11.a:0 "the horror... the horror"
 scorza.12.t:0 "Breaking the Shore"
 scorza.12.d:0 "Our Fourth Shore, consisting of Libya and Tunisia, is the Empire's most proud possession. Every loyal Italian sees the land as equally important and necessary as the main peninsula itself, and many in Rome know that it is the cornerstone for our colonial empire. The residents of the fourth shore, however, do not hold the same views and instead feel that they are better off without us! They instead believe in ideals of autonomy, local rule, and other such liberal nonsense. This absurd notion must be put down immediately, and our ever loyal general dalla Chiesa is the man for the job.\n\nThe plan is simple, land soldiers and tanks in the colonies, shoot anybody who disagrees with our glorious leader, and burn any villages supporting the rebellion. Our navy will stand ready and threaten any foreign nation attempting to support the traitors, and our air force will obliterate them from above. As our brave men move alongside the coast and clear out the rebels, we can replace the incompetent governors with new people entirely loyal to Il Duce. And, when complete, we shall double the local garrison to ensure future revolts never even occur.\n\nAlready, our boys are landing on Libyan beaches and arriving into the dockyards, ready to serve their nation. Photographers and cameramen follow them, taking pictures for use in propaganda. The tanks will arrive later today, and with them, we will move onward, crushing the rebel scum under our tracts. No one will escape the wrath of Italy!"
 scorza.12.a:0 "Those uppity colonials shall learn their place"
 scorza.13.t:0 "Securing Rome"
 scorza.13.d:0 "Our glorious leader, Carlo Scorza, still has many political opponents in our capital, and due to recent events many of them are forming together to push him out of office. Through political connections and popular support these traitors pose a serious threat to the regime and must be silenced quickly. Luckily, the military has chosen to support Scorza in full, and already many of the local divisions are moving into Rome to secure the city. Hoping to avoid another Verona, the goal is to eliminate the use of vehicles and tanks and instead use ground soldiers to accomplish our task. By arresting and executing these rats, Scorza will finally be free to rule Italy as he sees fit, without anybody telling him otherwise.\n\nThe opposition has consolidated around many members of the lower house of Parliament, and as such it will be a good move to shut it down and arrest anybody suspected of treason. Special forces have been deployed to handle the delicate matter, and are expected to come into contact with the troublemakers soon. If all goes to plan, this maneuver will be smooth and simple, and little blood will be shed. As a bonus, hopefully the people will not be aware of our actions, as such matters are far too sensitive for them to understand.\n\nOnward, brave sons of Italy! Protect Il Duce and the Empire for which he stands!!"
 scorza.13.a:0 "Get them out of here, get them the hell out!"
 scorza.14.t:0 "Laying Down the Law"
 scorza.14.d:0 "The elite forces were shocked by the presence of Scorza himself when they began to advance onto parliament. Il Duce greeted him there with a smile, stating that he must look into the eyes of those who wish him gone as they are judged for their crimes. It was decided that him and his personal guard of blackshirts will storm the Chamber of Fasci after the soldiers clear out the building.\n\nAs the barricaded doors blew open, Il Duce emerged with his entourage. He moved up to the floor, with the confidence of a Roman general, and gave his speech. He denounced the treasonous activity and gave every member the last chance to declare their loyalty for the Empire and be spared his wrath. All the people there chose not to bend the knee, and instead sat in solidarity, unwilling to give the dictator the satisfaction. In disgust, Scorza gave them one last mercy; a chance to plead their guilt and have the honor of being able to execute themselves. When again, no one moved, Scorza began screaming at them in rage, announcing that they would all be put down like dogs. The soldiers raised their guns, and when Scorza gave the order, fired round after round into the crowd. It was then, when being massacred that they began to beg for his mercy.\n\nBut it was too late, as Il Duce no longer had any."
 scorza.14.a:0 "You fought the law, and we won"
 scorza.15.t:0 "The Coverup"
 scorza.15.d:0 "Now that the traitors are dead and Italy is saved, it is time to wash the blood off of our hands and pretend that nothing happened. Through a combination of false charges and convenient accidents, we have been able to sweep everything from the massacre in Rome to Verona under the rug. Everybody who knows the truth is absolutely loyal to Il Duce, and if any future incidents occur we know that the military has our backs. The people may not view us in the most positive light, but for now they support us. Scorza has the nation of Italy, and Italy has Carlo Scorza, for better or worse.\n\nOur atrocities must never be leaked, never be whispered in the shadows, and never told in a tavern after a few too many drinks. The punishment for even discussing these actions is death to the perpetrator and their family. We are on thin ice, and it only takes one idiot to make the cracks swallow us up, for what we did in Rome, in Verona... is unforgivable. If they only knew, our heads would be on pikes and Italy would be engulfed in chaos.\n\nWe must bear our burdens, and bear them we shall as we make Italy into the great nation it was intended. "
 scorza.15.a:0 "The realities of what happened here shall be buried, no matter the cost"
 scorza.16.t:0 "The Truth Revealed"
 scorza.16.d:0 "It can't be... it just can't.\n\nNewspapers all over the world bear the headline SCORZA MASSACRES THOUSANDS. World leaders condemn us to hell for our actions. The people cry for revolution. Somebody somewhere has released files connecting us to all of our crimes, and already the world is burning around us. Scorza himself has released a televised speech denying the accusations, but the evidence is damning. The cracks are spreading, and everybody is holding their breath.\n\nThe military is already declaring martial law in a few cities witnessing intense protest, and many police stations are cracking down, and hard. Colonials all across the Empire are stirring in anger, and the populace is screaming for retribution. It appears that there isn't enough support for a total revolution, so Scorza is safe for now with the army at his side.\n\nWe have made a terrible mistake, and now it is time for us to pay. May the mercy that we failed to show our enemies be granted upon us."

 ita.44.t:0 "A Tense Meeting"
 ita.44.d:0 "Our Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, recently returned from a meeting with key leaders in the Grand Council of Fascism in an attempt to sway them to his reformist agenda. Specifically, he targeted the bloc of old, hard-line fascists who either abstatined or refused to confirm him as Duce at the Verona Conference. Despite his best efforts, however, the Duce was unable to convince them to support him now.\n\nSpeaking to press a few hours after the meeting concluded, Ciano did not mince words. 'These gentlemen seem to be unable to accept that the world is changing around them. What worked in 1921 will not work today, and the solutions needed to fix our immense problems can not be found by looking into the past - but forward into the future.'\n\nCarlo Scorza, leader of the anti-reform block had no good words for Ciano either. In a leak of a speech to the Council obtained by the press, he denounced Ciano as a 'buffon' and a 'decadent, weak man unfit to fill the shoes of our first Duce'."

In a public meeting with party leaders Amintore Fanfani and Aldo Moro, Ciano was eager to show of his successes.\n\n'These two gentlemen right here are the future of reform in Italy!' he said to a camera, smile beaming. 'They are proof we can improve the condition of working people while staying true to our Christian roots and values.' Moro and Fanfani were similarly pleased with Ciano: 'When Mussolini passed away we were fearful for the future. We were worried we would turn into a mirror of Germany - a chaotic power struggle at the top and no care for the working people at the bottom. With Ciano in charge, our fears were laid to rest.'"

Quoted as saying that fascism is the 'lifeblood of the nation', readers have interpreted this as Scorza harkening for a return to the days of Mussolini style fascism, and to reverse the liberalisation currently in motion in Italy.

The second is a telling of the March on Rome, the foundation of fascist Italy, and the saving of it from decadent democracy and godless socialism. The third is a film covering one of Julius Caesar's finest battles, the battle of Alesia in Gaul, showing Italy in its glory days and the importance of a strong leader to bring victory and glory to Italia.

While most doubted the Italians ever had a real foot in the race, the regime still claimed that it was just as serious a contender as any, and had even launched a satellite in the previous year in an attempt to prove it, though it received little notice outside of Italy.\n\nThe Americans and Japanese have both vowed to one up the Germans with a claimed 'lunar colony' and a landing on Mars respectively, and while Duce Ciano has promised that Italy will also still remain a contender, the public seems to have little enthusiasm for what has become known as a money sink.\n\nThe biggest dissapointment seems to simply stem from the fact that Germany, Italy's great rival, was the one to claim victory."

 ita.915.t:0 "Italy Denounces Göring's Reign"
 ita.915.d:0 "Immediately after news arrived in Rome about Hermann Göring's victory in the German Civil War, the Italian government began preparing for the worst. The orders were given, and all branches of the government have been doing everything in their power to address the likely conflict with Germany. It is apparent that the we must begin preparing for a fight through rapid mobilization and defensive planning. Nearly everyone is scrambling to assess and evaluate the situation and enact these policies as quickly as possible. This morning, a statement has been passed onto the media by authority of the Italian government saying that "The Italian Empire is once more at threat from the German regime, now lead by the war-mongering dictator Hermann Göring. He has shown no respect for the sovereignty of nations throughout Europe, and has shown a willingness to engage in war in order to achieve nationalistic goals against the benefit of the common good. Even now he prepares to once more bring blood-shed with his aggressive posturing and accusations against Switzerland, Sweden, Hungary, Romania, and others. Italy will not stand by and allow for darkness to fall upon the continent once more, and we are prepared to address any aggression towards the people of Europe as aggression to Italy herself. The Italian Empire is now asking all foreign states to stand in solidarity with her against the German Reich. She asks for all who wish for peace to put aside their grievances with one another in order to dissuade the Reich from taking any more aggressive action. And specifically, she reaches out to Iberia and Turkey for renewed cooperation against the German menace."
 ita.915.a:0 "We must come together."

 ita.916.t:0 "Italy Reestablishes Connections to Iberia"
 ita.916.d:0 "Today, an Italian diplomatic envoy arrived in Madrid to meet with the Iberian government in an attempt to reconcile with their former ally. They hope to show Iberians that they both stand in Hermann Göring's sights and are likely to be soon invaded by the German war machine and, whether or not that is true, it is important that good relations are necessary for the safety of Atlantic shipments. The Italians believe that mutual cooperation will be the best course of action in diverting conflict, and that working together will ensure the two nation's mutual survival in the face of this new threat, even if they aren't too keen on making friends with the Iberians. Although Italy feels that the only sane option for Iberia would be to work together again, the diplomats exiting the first meetings have been left with mixed feelings about the whole affair. This is due to the Iberians asking hard questions about the Gibraltar Dam payments, the Italian Empire's inability to keep the Triumvirate alive, and general bickering between the Spanish and Portuguese representatives over even the most trivial detail. To all of this, the ambassadors had little to reply with. Rome is currently praying that Iberia will advance negotiations and come to some sort of agreement with them. "
 ita.916.a:0 "Let's hope they can swallow their pride for once."

 ita.917.t:0 "Italy Reestablished Connections to Turkey"
 ita.917.d:0 "After the recent war between Italy and Turkey, Italy cut of all diplomatic ties with Turkey. This has been the status quo until recently, when an envoy from Rome arrived in Ankara in reaction to Hermann Göring's victory in the German Civil War. The Turks were not surprised at us reaching out and have already allowed the ambassadors to re-occupy the abandoned embassy. Anti-Italian hostilities still run rampant throughout the nation, however, and the diplomats have had to be escorted in bullet-proof cars and be given personal bodyguards by Turkey when out in public. Angry citizens throw bottles at their lodgings and scream for them to leave and never return, while the streets are packed with protesters vehemently opposed to their presence. The Turkish government has had a different view of the diplomats, seeing this as an opportunity to protect themselves from the openly malicious Germans, but are stuck in a hard position in which if they accept Italian cooperation, they will lose massive support from the local populace and if they refuse to negotiate they leave themselves vulnerable to Nazi invasion. They have so far been supportive of Anti-Italian policies as a means of gaining political support but taking such a stance here would certainly be suicide in the long run. As a response to this delima, the Turks have agreed to allow for the Italians to stay but have been unclear about any further action. Although not entirely successful, the envoy still rejoiced at reconnecting with their former ally turned foe."

No nation has ever been able to truly placate them and even the great Empire of Italy suffered at their insolence during the Second World War. But now, we have an amazing opportunity, a chance to use them to our advantage! With some outreach and old weaponry dating back decades, we are sure that the Balkan region can be turned into a meat grinder able to both terrify and annihilate German divisions under Göring and his buffoons. The new Führer may have his nuclear arms and other wonders of science, but now we can harness our own secret weapon in the shape of insane partisans. Already, the Italian government has started strengthening ties with Croatia, Serbia, and others in an attempt to show that the Italians are friendly and willing to work together to repel any foreign threats. The response and leveling degrees of mutual cooperation between these nations and Italy in the future are completely unknown, but the military has already begun making connections of their own with rebel groups, nationalist organizations, and pretty much anybody we have struggled with in the past. This probably won't end well, but let's just hope that they and the Germans wear each other down enough for Italy to survive and perhaps maintain their hegemony. One can only dream, afterall."

 ita.919.t:0 "Italy Reaches Out to The OFN"
 ita.919.d:0 "It is no secret that any nation, dictator, rebel, or person opposed to the Germans and Japanese can be given a blank check by the Organization of Free Nations, lead by the United States. That being said, we have sent our best sweet talkers over to Washington D. C. to get funding and equipment. Any and all help from America will be essential to our success in a war with Germany. However, there have never been great relations between our two nations, who were technically at war during the 1940's, although no fighting broke out between the two. And due to America being a democracy, their response can be unpredictable. Who knows how Uncle Sam will respond to possible involvement in another foreign war? And there is always a sense of anxiety when nations with nuclear stockpiles clash. In the end Italy is still optimistic about American support and entirely dependent business connections there. The United States has generously arranged meetings to discuss our mutual interests over the coming week. We are poised to make great headway in negotiations and everybody in Rome is depending on good news. Besides, how can they resist good, old-fashioned Italian charm?"
 ita.919.a:0 "We'll make them an offer that they can't refuse."

 ita.920.t:0 "Italy Engages Talks With The East Asia Co Prosperity Sphere"
 ita.920.d:0 "In the face of war for survival against the Nazi hordes lead by the tyrant Hermann Göring, any and all outside help will be crucial. This is why we sent multiple agents over to the Japanese Empire in an attempt to gain any and all support possible. Japan may not seem like the most obvious choice, or even a good one, they are always trying to damage the Germans in any way possible, especially now that Göring's in charge. Our first step was to contact the Chrysanthemum throne, although any beneficial response is unlikely. That is exactly why the majority of or resources will be devoted to lobbying the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy. It is expected that the navy and army will both see honor in our cause, however anything is possible and they may not be in a position to provide actual support aside from a few statements. And if the navy or army found out we were courting the other, they may both become bitter and completely stop all talks. Unlike the OFN, nobody in Rome is expecting anything spectacular from the isolationist state. But if they did align with us, it might be enough to shift the odds in our favor in an upcoming conflict."

We have seriously blunted the German war machine and forced them to withdraw back across the border. Faith in the German government is severely shaken, and though Hungary stands battered, it still stands.\n\n It's hard to predict what will happen to Germany, but all eyes are upon them as the world awaits their next move."

  ITA.5001.d:0 "What many considered to be an unstoppable wave, the German Heer have broken upon the Romania army and its Italian allies, and the two have held.\n\n Against what seemed like impossible odds, Italian assistance arrived just in time to assist the battered Romanian forces. With fresh troops and a mountain of supplies pouring in from the Black Sea, the Romanians have been able to put up a stubborn resistance against the German invaders. The war has dragged on to the point that the Reich can simply not continue to support their invasion. The Germans, just short of victory, have been forced to turn back and withdraw to Germany.\n\n This embarrassing defeat will have conquensences. It remains to be seen how this will affect German politics. "

Serbian formations quickly took to the hills and mountains, waging a protracted guerilla campaign in the countryside. With no small amount of Italian assistance, the government managed to hold onto enough of the urban centers to prevent the state from complete collapse. With attrition taking its toll, along with progress grinding to a complete halt, the Germans had no choice but to turn back.\n\n Today is a great day for Italy!

  ITA.5003.d:0 "The campaign was lost before it ever really started.\n\n The German Heer crashed upon the Hungarian army across their entire border, and the Hungairians were pushed back on all fronts. By the time Italian forces finally arrived on the ground, the war was all but lost. With too few men for us to make any meaningful difference, we had no choice but to pull our men out of the country.\n\n The mood in our nation is grim; an important Italian ally has fallen to the Reich in an outright invasion! The Reich's aggressive actions are simply outrageous, but short of declaring war on Germany, there is nothing more we can do at the moment. The only thing left to do is to prepare for the German's inevitable next move."

  ITA.5004.d:0 "Some in the administration blame the Romanian's lack of willpower to resist the Nazi invasion. So point out that there was little counter to the Luftwaffe, while other blame the logistic links between Romania and Italy; there simply wasn't enough time to deploy enough men to help shore up the defenses.\n\n The reality, however, is the same. Our ally, Romania, has capitulated to German. Even with a substantial amount of Italian boots on the ground, our men were beaten back to the shores of the Black Sea. We had no choice but to abandon the Romanians to their fate and regroup for the German's next move."

We not only suffered an embarrassing defeat which has been detrimental to Italian morale, but have also lost a strategically important ally right next to our own borders. All that can be done now is wait for the German's next move..."

 ita.6000.d:0 "Lately, high ranking police officers and detectives have noticed something...odd. Across the country, there seems to be a wave of a particular type of crimes. Specifically, some armories and banks have been robbed across the country, with the perpetrators disappearing with their hands full of guns in the former cases, and of money in the latter. Such things would be considered somewhat normal, but there seems to be a pattern in place. At the same time, agents have reported that FD members and supporters have been intimidated or beaten up. We know for sure that the Brigate Nere are no more and that Farinacci's dead, but after frisking a suspicious student outside an university in Milan, policemen found a gun that had been recently stolen and a flyer containing propaganda for an organization or group called "NAR". So far, our policemen agree that these groups are probably just a small remnant of the Brigate Nere of old, and it's highly unlikely that they could be in any way connected to the recent robberies. Still, this situation will have to be monitored, if we want political violence to remain a memory of the past."

 ita.6001.t:0 "A Slight Issue"
 ita.6001.d:0 "At this point in time, the redistricting maps for our first election have been drafted and the careful process of apportioning seats has been completed. Or at least that is what we thought, as it appears that the state of Benito has been completely forgotten, meaning that all of our calculations are off and the state isn't factored into the overall election. Even though the desert state has a remarkably low population and is a rather embarrassing part of our empire, its people still have a right to vote for the Italian leadership fairly. How such an idiotic mistake could happen is currently baffling Rome, as it now appears that we will have to completely start the process over from scratch, from the bottom up, to ensure that these elections can be completed with every state having the ability to vote equally. This entire process hopefully won't delay the elections, but it will cost us a large sum of money to fix this simple mistake. Worse yet, many are even considering just abandoning Benito as a cheaper alternative, something that would surely cause massive outrage and set a dangerous precedent.\n\nThis is just a small part of a much larger problem, which is that the Italian Empire has very little experience in running a democracy and our bureaucrats are overwhelmed with the stress of putting on elections. The general confusion that has taken hold of the government has left us with a quite disorganized, sloppy mess with problems ranging from non standardized ballots to forgetting an entire state. Even Ciano himself seems to be in over his head as he begins to realize how difficult this process is going to be. These are rather trying times, but if we can somehow make it through these elections we should be much more prepared for the following ones to come. Let's just pray that our streak of bad luck will end and it will be smooth sailing from here on out. "

 ita.6002.t:0 "Bruno Visentini Gives a Speech"
 ita.6002.d:0 "Being a minor party, nobody in Italy believes that Bruno Visentini and the Partito Repubblicano Italiano can win these elections. Determined however to give it his best shot, Visenti has decided to go full throttle and go for the victory. Today, as an attempt to get the people on his side, he has travelled to the University of Bari to give a speech to the students and encourage them to vote for him and his party.\n\nHe delivered his message in a small conference room on campus, with an audience of less than fifty people present and only one reporter, who was half asleep. Not to be discouraged, Visenti spoke with his usual energy, proudly exclaiming that he saw no reason why a little party like his couldn't win seats in Parliament and why even the people in that room could make all the difference. Ever smiling, he even answered questions directly asked by the audience, being caught off guard by how difficult they were. But even when asked why he even bothered running, he exclaimed proudly that he definitely won't win if he doesn't try. After talking for a bit more and making some awkward jokes that didn't quite land, he ended the speech with his new slogan of "Go we go", which he tried to get the crowd to chant with him, unsuccessfully.\n\nAs if not embarrassed enough, when Visentini turned around he noticed a portrait of Aldo Moro, his rival leading the Christian Democrats and apparently an alumni of the university, hanging behind the podium he was speaking at. And yet, even though he began to feel discouraged, he kept smiling as he left, unwilling to let down his party and the Italian people."

 ita.6003.t:0 "Early Polling Presents an Odd Phenomenon"
 ita.6003.d:0 "As part of our attempts to get a good idea as to how these elections will turn out, we have commissioned polling associations to go from town to town to randomly select individuals and ask them who they planned on voting for. The results are still mostly being processed and will likely be only available a few days before the elections themselves, but we have discovered one alarming trend.\n\nIt appears that in Sicily, especially in the regions scattered with old people's homes and retirement communities, there has been a shocking number of citizens declaring that they want Benito Mussolini to win in the coming elections. Apparently, the old Duce was still quite popular and even the fact that he was deceased was not enough to keep him out of politics. When confronted about why they would choose a candidate from beyond the grave, the elderly voters either were confused and thought he was still alive or were just in plain denial that he could ever not be Duce. While the numbers were nowhere near high enough to actually influence the election results, this does show one of the very flaws in democracy that ironically the fascists have targeted for decades, in that some people are simply too ignorant to choose their own leaders, and yet these ignorant people seem best drawn to the fascists who most lack respect for them.\n\nIn any event, this odd situation has become quite a joke around Italy, with pranksters making fake campaign posters of Mussolini and newspapers reporting on his popularity alongside the actual candidates. Even Ciano himself is reported to have burst out laughing upon hearing the news, finding humor in the peculiar adoration his father-in-law still contains in the hearts of the people."
 ita.6003.a:0 "I wonder what Mussolini would think of all this?"
 ita.6004.t:0 "Allegations of Tyranny!"
 ita.6004.d:0 "The press today was once again filled with explosive headlines about the Blocchi Nazionali. This time, it was about the blatant ties between the BN and the former Partito Nazionale Fascista. While if was fairly obvious that the BN was full of borderline fascists or even actual fascists, the breadth and depth of the ties were unknown until now.\n\nAn investigative journalist successfully infiltrated the BN and what they found was "horrifying", as the Fronte Democratico put it. Money from the old PNF was put in the BN coffers. Politicians basically swapped parties and stayed in the same seat. Nepotism favoring senior PNF politicians. The findings of the journalist went on and on. While the other scandals were eventually weathered, this scandal has hurt the BN greatly. Some politicians involved in the scandal have resigned, causing special elections that the BN is unlikely to win. Multiple members of the BN in parliament have turned their coat and joined the right wing of the Democrazia Cristiana, and worst of all, the BN is starting to lose members at a steady rate. If the trends are to continue, the BN would no longer be the biggest party in Italy, and they could even lose their majority in Parliament.\n\nAlmirante, surprisingly, has responded to this scandal. He has decried them as false reports, and that the so-called 'journalist' is nothing more than a Fronte Democratico spy! Most high ranking BN members have followed his word on this, especially the members who are implicated in the scandal. It is clear that the BN is sticking to their by now classic strategy of weathering the newest scandal."
 ita.6004.a:0 "A mere scandal!"
 ita.6005.t:0 "An Interview with the King"
 ita.6005.d:0 "A recent interview of Umberto II by Franco Alfano has ended up causing another scandal for the Blocchi Nazionali. Almirante has been praising the King of Italy in nearly every speech or discussion recently, to the point that Pietro Nenni, leader of the Fronte Democratico, jokingly praised the king himself in one of his speeches, to much laughter. Therefore, when Umberto II has interviewed recently, it was obvious that Alfano had to ask what Umberto himself thought of the matter. His answer, was...surprising to say the least.\n\nUmberto called Almirante's constant praise an attempt to suck up to the monarchy, and then proceeded to say he'd rather talk about his new medals obtained in service to Italy, which he did for a solid 30 minutes, almost half of the interview. This has turned into an incredibly embarrassing event for the BN, as it shows that the King of Italy basically thinks of Almirante as a joke. This has also, predictably by this point, turned into a scandal.\n\nThe scandal that has erupted from this is about the fact that if the King of Italy cannot even vouch his nominal support to the BN, then what right to they have to rule? As is the case, the BN have remained very quiet, and Almirante has apparently remained unfazed, although he does not praise Umberto II very much anymore, much to the sadness of the FD, who cannot make jokes about it anymore.\n\nIronically, many war veterans who have medals have been interviewed about them due to this, and it seems Umberto has gotten in on the joke, and he can now barely be seen without his frankly impressive collection of medals pinned on his clothes, much to the exasperation of the BN."
 ita.6005.a:0 "That IS a pretty nice array of medals!"
 ita.6006.t:0 "Another Scandal for Almirante!"
 ita.6006.d:0 "To absolutely no one's surprise, the Blocchi Nazionali have involved themselves in yet another scandal. Almirante made a recent speech about his past in fascist Italy, and praised it greatly. Not only that, he called it "a much more prosperous time", much to the horror of basically everyone who aren't fascists. Furthermore, he stated that "Fascism did nothing wrong" which has basically led to his utter ridicule in the media.\n\nThe media, besides ridiculing him, has completely dismantled every part of his speech ana pointed out why every section of it was false or wrong. The Fronte Democratico has finally blatantly called Almirante an "idiot", while the Democrazia Cristiana has seemed to support the sentiment of the FD. Even some of the people in the BN have said that "perhaps it was not such a good thing for Almirante to say", which is incredibly radical for them.\n\nIn comparison, the openly fascist groups of Italy have declared support for Almirante, as "he understands when Italy was at its zenith and why". This has led to a split of sorts in Italian society, as the fascist sections are now in full alignment with Almirante, while the anti fascist sections are in a strong opposition to him."
 ita.6006.a:0 "How will the Blocchi Nazionali recover from this?"
 ita.6007.t:0 "Almirante Goes Before the Chamber"
 ita.6007.d:0 "Today, Honourable Prime Minister Giorgio Almirante has addressed the nation in a speech broadcasted by radio and television. With fiery rhetoric, Almirante offered his account of the events since the inception of Ciano's reforms, including the creation of the Blocchi Nazionali, and the elections themselves. He admitted that his party often "did not show fully its commitment to the democratic cause", but he went on to remark that pride in fascism isn't nostalgia, and that it is not incompatible with genuine love for democracy.\n\nGiorgio Almirante went on to explain the aims and the policies which the Blocchi Nazionali will pursue, and to show that they are merely expressions of the people's will, not a return to the past. Finally, the Prime Minister ended his speech by blaming the political tension experienced by the country on the left opposition. The Fronte Democratico, said Almirante, "isn't very democratic at all, considering their hatred for the democratically elected government". Almirante concluded by saluting the Italian people, and by assuring it that with the Blocchi Nazionali in power, the nation is in good hands.\n\nImmediately, it appeared clear that with this speech, Almirante would finally win over the silent majority of the nation. While leftist groups are still staunchly opposed to the government, moderates and centrists are finally convinced of Almirante's good intentions and political competency, there are rumors that Moro's DC, or at least its right wing, could finally openly side with Almirante's BN. Only one thing is certain, that now, the Blocchi Nazionali have the reins of the nation firmly in their hands, but nobody knows if they will steer Italy towards democracy, or back towards fascism."

This great feat is the victory in a free and fair election, one which rocked us and made us fight tooth and nail to ensure the support of the people of Italy. And when it became time for the citizenry to vote, they showed their confidence in us by giving us a mandate of power through the democratic process. And now it is our time to reward their loyalty and faith by delivering on our promises to reform Italy into the nation that the people deserve, a nation for the people, not dictators or extremists.

And now that we have achieved victory in these elections, they should be much more receptive to our attempts to negotiate, even if they are a bit embittered at their losses. Hopefully, we will be able to achieve enough support from at least one party to easily pass any and all reforms that we hope to see be put into place.

Even though they appear to simply be rebranded fascists seeking to restore the old system, they have so far shown a willingness to engage in talks about possibly working together in Parliament. This pleases our leadership greatly, as we have yet to achieve the majority it would take to pass any bill we wish. Therefore, in order to further test their commitment to a possible coalition government, Aldo Moro will seek to meet with his rival Giorgio Almirante so as to put our squabbling behind us and move forward hand in hand with the intent of efficiently legislating. While they may not be too keen on our reforms just yet, we're sure that they can be convinced to at least support something if we spend enough time and effort to convince and guide them on the matter."

Now that we have the authority to fulfill our promise, it is time to begin meeting with the generals and representatives of the military do decide what is necessary for them to maintain their fighting ability without overspending ourselves. While many in the party are generally opposed to the expansion of our army and navy due to the need of scarce resources elsewhere in the nation, they will have to accept that we made a promise and that if we break it we will be unable to perform any legislative action as long as we exist."

This is a fact that that the Blocchi Nazionali need to realize before they start making demands of us and try to bargain from a position that they shall never obtain. Although Almirante and his goons will be hard to convince, the truth is self evident that they aren't what they think they are and if they refuse to cooperate their party will likely fall into irrelevance by the next election. Of course, the very existence of their party is based off of the fact that they can't let go of the past and begin again in a new Italy, so who knows if they can abandon their ways for the common good.

As a way to finally become closer with the Blocchi Nazionali, we must dispel these rumors, as they currently drive a wedge in between us. This can be accomplished by a new campaign consisting of the adoration of our motherland and our willingness to protect her and her interests. Moro himself should give speeches announcing his love for his home nation and how he is going to work in every way to keep her great and powerful in this new era.

While our policies and legislation won't be quite what the Fronte Democratico wants, given the choice between moderate reform and no reform at all, we are sure that they would make the decision that most benefits Italy and her people.

And now the ball is in our court, we are the ones who control the destiny of this magnificent empire and the fate of her people, and this fate is none other than a transition into a permanent democracy, one that cannot ever revert back into fascism and will instead grow to serve us well.

After all, in a democracy the power of the government is the power of trust earned, and the people will not be able to give us this faith if we fail to give them any reforms in our first years of office.

For starters, the current reforms are strongly hierarchic, favoring the humanities and the theoretical sciences (taught in the "licei") to the detriment of the technical and professional schools (the "istituti") for this reason, many lower class children are simply encouraged to leave the schools, rather than pursue a field of study which would be useful only if they could afford university.

 christdem.1.t:0 "Christian Democrats Victorious!"
 christdem.1.d:0 "The votes have been counted, and it has become clear to all of Italy that Aldo Moro and his Christian Democrat party has seized control of the government. With strong showings in both the upper and lower chambers of Parliament, the Christian Democrats have dominant legislative power in Rome, and it is now their turn to lead the nation. Celebrations are already taking place in the streets, not only because of who won, but because they just had their first free and fair elections in a very long time.\n Moro, in response to this great victory, aired a speech on the radio welcoming the election results and showing his appreciation for the trust given to him by the Italian people. In this broadcast, he first thanked the people for electing him and promised to do everything in his power to improve their lives and the state of Italy. Next, he went on to explain how his government would work towards ensuring that the other parties are still given a fair voice and the ability to cooperate in matters of policy. Cheerfully, he went on to explain that this was a new dawn for Italy and for the first time in a long time her future is looking bright.\n After the broadcast, the losing parties gave their concession speeches, and although not nearly as joyful, the public was happy to see them accept defeat with grace. Now it is time for Moro to really reform the Empire to his liking. Having platformed on mostly education reform and social security, it is predicted that he will follow through and let them be his main focus for the time coming. He will also attempt to work with the other parties, even the Blocchi Nazionali, to make certain that this first democratic government doesn't collapse as a result of infighting. This is a historic day for not only Moro himself, but all of Italy and the world."

 christdem.6.d:0 "In the ecstasy following the Christian Democrats victory in the Italian Empire's first democratic election, it was easy to forget a hard truth, despite their strong showing, the CD fell far short of a majority in the Italian Parliament, and hence, to accomplish anything significant in their agenda, must make a coalition agreement with one of the other parties. The Christian Democrats first choice would be the Fronte Democratico, who share their commitment to Italian Democracy and desire for entitlement and education reform. However, early signals from the SD seem to suggest that this course will be difficult. As the price for their cooperation, The Fronte Democratico have demanded that the new educational curriculum include a segment on the "fascist period" and in particular, the "clerical institutions", who through their "cooperation" with the oppressive regime extended its longevity and cruelty. A suggestion that is considered frankly insulting by the strongly Catholic CD.\n\nOf course, the Fronte Democratico are not the only potential coalition partner for the Christian Democrats, there is also the Blocchi Nazionali-- the avowedly nationalist organization made up almost entirely of former Fascist Party members. The NB's leader Giorgio Almirante has declared his parties great willingness to cooperate with the CD, calling them "our brothers, dedicated to a strong Italian Empire", and has asked for only minor concessions as the price for a coalition government. However, the Christian Democrats fear polluting their commitment to the new Italy by working with a party that still salutes Mussolini the Patriot besides Ciano the Reformer. During the campaign, the CD had firmly disavowed any possibility of allying with the National Bloc, but the CD's leader Aldo Moro has since walked back this position, claiming that his party is "open to working with any group that believes in a peaceful democratic Italy". Some have argued this is just a tactic to pressure the Fronte Democratico to ease their coalition demands, while others believe it prestiges a broad right-wing coalition."
 christdem.6.a:0 "We must find a partner worthy of our ambitions!"

 christdem.7.t:0 "A Meeting with the Blocchi Nazionali"
 christdem.7.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has personally sat down with Giorgio Almirante and other Blocchi Nazionali party officials to discuss forming a coalition government in Parliament. So far, Almirante's party has expressed a willingness to work with the Christian Democrats and this meeting had high expectations attached to it by both parties. It began rather formally, with hand shaking and smiles and the politicians all acting as if they were old friends and not just recently tearing each other apart in the elections. However, as talks began and the Blocchi Nazionali began making their demands, it became abundantly clear that there would be no compromise. To start off with, Almirante refused to negotiate if Moro pursued his policies of education reform and social security, saying that both would end up damaging Italy more than helping it. He went on to counter every single proposition made by Moro and practically inferred that there would be no reform in a coalition with his party. As if that wasn't enough, the final nail in the coffin was when Almirante began to rant about how the Christian Democrats should instead support his policies rather than pursue theirs and that was the only way to keep the Italian Empire alive. Realizing that this was completely futile, the Christian Democrats began signaling that no coalition would be made and that the meeting had come to a close. Not understanding, or perhaps not caring, Almirante only continued on with his insane plans, explaining the political situation as if the Blocchi Nazionali had won the elections and they were trying to make a coalition. About an hour later, Almirante was finally satisfied with himself and let the meeting end. The damage had already been done, however, and it was plain to anybody in Rome that there was no chance of the two parties working together in the future."
 christdem.7.a:0 "Probably for the best, all things considered."

 christdem.8.t:0 "Negotiations Complete"
 christdem.8.d:0 "The Christian Democrat party has officially formed a coalition with the small Liberal Party under Bruno Visentini, and the talks with the talks with the Fronte Democratico have mostly concluded and are generally positive. With enough support behind him Moro is now ready to move onto other priorities, chief among them actually passing the gradual reforms that we campaigned on. It is high time we actually create some legislature, after all that is what we were elected into office to do. The initial bills have been drafted and they are ready to be introduced into the lower chamber. Hopefully, we will be able to get them through with enough support in the coming future through our deals and coalition. Every single representative that has been recently elected is quite excited for these first few steps, and the people cry out for us to take Italy by the hand and lead her to a brighter world, and it is our duty to oblige them. We will make these ideas and reforms into law and not allow anything to stop us in our great quest to bring upon a better world. Hopefully, the other parties can see the same thing and work with us rather than against us, for only together do we have a chance of actually accomplishing anything. Moro himself is perhaps the most optimistic, being described as constantly smiling and always happy to discuss policy with anyone in ear reach. He has even held conferences with individual deputies to both ensure their support and ask their opinions on key issues, never fading in his hope to create a good, functioning administration. It is not sure if he will maintain this enthusiasm, however, as politics is said to destroy even the most iron of wills."

 christdem.9.t:0 "Education Reform Bill Proposed in the Chamber"
 christdem.9.d:0 "The Democrazia Cristiana party has recently proposed their first bill meant to address the education problem in Italy. The bill, entitled the Delegated Decrees on Schooling, or "Moro Reform" would include a variety of reforms mostly centered around mandatory education in primary and secondary levels of schooling for all Italian youth.\n\nHowever, we are a long way off from turning this bill into a law as the process has only just begun. If we wish for the reform to ever come into reality, we must must work tirelessly to convince the other parties to support it. Specifically, we need either the social democrat votes or the fascist votes in order to pass the law. The Liberal Party, while small and mostly insignificant, will likely vote with us without any accomodation, but it is certain that the two major parties will request certain provisions to be added or removed and we will have to negotiate to earn their favor.\n\nThis is still a great step for our administration, and the people will be excited to know that we are actively setting out to accomplish our promises. If we succeed, this will both be a major victory for our party and all of Italy, for by educating the youth we will truly earn our place as a modern nation with modern principles."

 christdem.10.t:0 "Peeling Away Votes from the Fascists"
 christdem.10.d:0 "Although we were unable to form a coalition with the Blocchi Nazionali, there must be a few less extreme member of the party who would support these minor reforms. It is now time to do every deputy's favorite task, going around and begging other representatives to try and support our legislature that will soon be decided upon. All it should take is a little bit of compromising and a sprinkle of smooth talking from Moro to convince at least a few of the idiots to support our bill, right? Of course, nothing is that simple, as many are either making outrageous demands or giving vague responses, leaving us unsure of whether or not they will be on our side. This is troubling, but hopefully we managed to get some of them to vote with us, at least enough to secure a majority when the final vote is made in a few weeks. In the end, the fascists will at least be grateful that we tried to include them in the negotiations, and this could plant the seed for future cooperation when they inevitably get sick of being in a party that can't accomplish get any bills passed. Only time will tell if we can achieve our task of giving education to the children of Italy. Surely, partisan troubles can't possibly stand in the way of common-sense reform, not forever. Moro has one more meeting with some of the members of Blocchi Nazionali soon, and it may be his final chance to gain the support he needs."

 christdem.11.t:0 "The Final Demands"
 christdem.11.d:0 "Today, after Moro sat down with the remaining Blocchi Nazionali members who are still on the fence about the education reform, he finally got the list of what it would take to get their votes. These demands were handed over with very little formalities or subtly, with the clear assumption that unless the bill had what they wanted, there would be no votes for it from them. The first demand was that of historical revisionism. The fascists are rather afraid of us introducing educational materials and works that would counter what they believe to be indisputable facts. They still see Benito Mussolini as Italy's great savior, and they simply must have him and the Fascist Party be given the appropriate attention and praise that they deserve. While we would never dare enforce anything that challenged Mussolini's fame and importance, this appears to be seeking praise of the very system of government we just abandoned for good reason, and many of the misconceptions that the Blocchi Nazionali would like to see pushed in schools are borderline lies and propaganda. However, the writing is on the wall, and we will have to conform to what they want if we wish to gain their votes when the time comes. Now, our party is faced with this dilemma. If we do what Almirante's party wants, we could secure the support we need while sacrificing many of the values and honest beliefs that we campaigned on. If we fail to gain the votes, our reform's could fail to pass and the children will suffer for our inability to take action. The ball is now in the Christian Democrats court."
 christdem.11.a:0 "Compromise is a wicked thing."

 christdem.12.t:0 "Securing Internal Support"
 christdem.12.d:0 "With the bill to reform the education system in Italy no longer new news, it has become necessary to ensure that the members of our party are still fully behind it. After all, this is a pillar of the Christian Democrat platform and our survival in the political landscape depends on our ability to band together and pass the essential legislation that we promised to the voters. Fractures in the party lines now could also lead to more trouble down the line, and then there would be no hope for us to win the next election. We will start with simply reminding the deputies that align with us of the importance of this bill to ensure that they do not get distracted from the primary task at hand. Meanwhile, a renewed advertising campaign will both rile up the public and put the pressure on the parliament to see FEOTA is able to pass through and become law. The public has already shown a determination to improve educational standards in the elections, and forgetting to fulfill that promise we made to them would be fatal for any party member seeking to be reelected. Of course, we are not expecting any resistance from our officials in regards to the situation and are not seeking to threaten them in any way, instead, we only seek to unite them at a time when unity and cooperation are the only things keeping the government, and all of Italy, together. After this shake up, we will be primed and ready to restart our efforts towards converting the votes of opposing parties to achieve the majority we need."
 christdem.12.a:0 "Let's hope this all pays off."

 christdem.13.t:0 "Moro gives speech in support of reforms"
 christdem.13.d:0 "Today, Aldo Moro has given a televised speech to the people of Italy in an attempt to build support for the Moro Reform. Education reform has been a constant demand by the populace, and Moro is hoping that they will pressure the members of the other parties to join on in support of the legislation.\nHe began simply, speaking about the abhorrent history of Italian education in the last century, how it has lagged behind the other nations of Europe and how even today hundreds of thousands of Italian people don't even have a high school diploma. He then spoke of the wonders of mandatory education and how a simple high school education, while somewhat difficult to attain, would serve the children of Italy for the rest of their lives. This would give the poor the opportunity to become rich, the ignorant to become scholarly, and the lazy to become hard working, only if the nation could unite and pass the bill that the Democrazia Cristiana have proposed. He finished the speech with a plea to the Fronte Democratico and the Blocchi Nazionali, a plea for unity and solidarity to pass the bill that will give young Italians everywhere the chance that they need to succeed in life. Moro explained that this is not a partisan issue, or even a political one, but it is instead a moral obligation that we have to our children and country.\nRousing many, public opinion polls have already shown an increase of the bill, and many party officials are hoping that this translates into political influence and votes from the other parties. At the very least, we put on display our concern and love for the people, and our opponents will have to fight an uphill battle to challenge Moro now."
 christdem.13.a:0 "The people stand behind us!"

 christdem.14.t:0 "A Meeting with Fronte Democratico"
 christdem.14.d:0 "The more liberal elements of our party have taken it upon themselves to meet with the left-wing Fronte Democratico party in an attempt to ensure they support our education bill when we hold the vote on the issue. Thankfully, we appear to be in good graces with the party and the hopes are that they will help is in this matter, giving us the votes we need and the ability to work closely with them in the future. Of course, we know that they will want us to make changes to the bill and reform the system to a much higher degree, but there is nothing in the legislation itself that the party would find repugnant and it is likely that we won't have much trouble getting them on board. We have even sweetened the deal by promising them future cooperation in regards to other reforms and policies that they find beneficial. The parties response has so far been a bit cautious, but mostly optimistic as education is a pillar of society that we all see is worth mending. It is predicted that they will give us an official response soon regarding their stance, and when they do we will know what must be done in order to achieve that threshold of supporters necessary to secure the bills chance of success. Meanwhile, this meeting has been met with criticism from the Blocchi Nazionali, who sees this move as disrespectful and weak. While their words do not affect us, we must make efforts to keep our independence and not really on other parties too much to achieve legislative progress. "
 christdem.14.a:0 "We must keep moving!"

 christdem.15.t:0 "Fronte Democratico Gives Their Reply"
 christdem.15.d:0 "Finally, after much stalling, the Fronte Democratico has given us the answer to our plea for help. Their response, while not a refusal or acceptance of support, is a deal that if we add certain parts to the bill then they will vote for it and back our party. This was to be expected, as nobody in politics ever agrees to anything without some negotiations. It appears that every single one of their demands is simply taking one of our parts of the bill and making it far more extreme in liberalization and practice. For example, while we wish to enforce a mandatory education for all students, the liberals would have us also put in place a common curriculum that ensures the children have a full and regimented education. That is one of the more mild requests, with some even asking that we include funding and resources for completely unrelated areas like subsidies for university students and grants for research. While many of these preliminary demands will be rendered null with a bit of negotiation, the fact stands that we will have to alter and add reforms to the bill if we wish to gain the support of the Fronte Democratico when we vote. Leadership of the Christian Democrat party however is urging caution, as fulfilling their demands too much will both make us look weak and make us lose the support of moderate-right deputies that have so far aligned with us."
 christdem.15.a:0 "All that matters is that we pass this bill!"

 christdem.16.t:0 "Voting Begins on the Moro Reform"
 christdem.16.d:0 "The Chamber is buzzing with activity, as today is the day that the deputies vote on the first major bill to be introduced into a democratic Italy. The Delegated Decrees on Schooling, the bill designed to improve educational standards and general quality of life in the nation, has been highly contentious and many are wondering if it will be able to pass through with enough votes to become law.\nMoro has been in a generally good mood, and while anxious at the prospect of having his first piece of legislation be a failure, is in high hopes and good spirits. Upon being questioned by a reporter as to his expectations, he responded by announcing that he expects many Italian politicians will be able to spot the merit in the bill and will put aside partisan squabbling to pass it, as the common interest amongst them is to help the people, not hinder them. However, it is well known that this bill's death would spell doom for both Moro and the Democrazia Cristiana, and being unable to pass legislation would inevitably lead to them losing the next elections.\nNo matter if the votes are in our favor or not, the populace will be watching us and responding appropriately to the results. Now we can only hold our breath and pray for good fortune."

Behind the scenes, talks of armed intervention began to conspire. Duce Almirante, fearing to let paranoia lead to his fall, chose not to investigate the rumors.\n\nThis morning forces of the Carabinieri stormed both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

From sea to shining sea, thousands of ships from our merchant navy unload every day quality goods around the world, proudly bearing our flag, and bring back home the finest delicacies from the most exotic country, just like the Maritime Republics did centuries ago. Italian businessmen are a mainstay at all trade summits along with Japanese zaibatsus and American tycoons, their counsel and expertise respected by all, and our companies control dozens of subsidiaries around the world.\n\nItaly's dominance of trade is uncontested, and our power and wealth grows by the day: with our people behind us, and our businessmen ahead of everyone, who can truly stop us?"

Let's face the truth, Italy no longer needs a gargantuan fleet like the one we have now, it's a money sinkhole that - let's be honest - we can no longer afford just for the sake of postcards: a radical solution is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the Regia Marina will be drastically reduced: all capital ships except carriers will be scrapped, and their personnel will be repurposed as marines and amphibious operations experts.

By constructing fortifications and depots to serve as anchors to our troops lines, we can help to nullify the enemy's advantages. \n\nIt certainly won't be easy. What bases we currently have in the Alps are poorly staffed and ill-supplied. Improving this situation will require a great commitment of resources and a long haul of detail-oriented adjustments.

There, among hundreds of folders, photos, files and sheets where the most commonly found word was [CONFIDENZIALE], a huge map had been spread out: at its centre, coloured in green, was Italy proper, with its Sphere in shades of green to represent their degree of allegiance, while the other nations were marked with different colours and shades depending on the alliance they were part of, their government, and anything else worth knowing. Chess pieces were laying on single nations, or grouped together depending on priority: the King stood, of course, atop Rome, the Queen on Germania, the Rooks on Ost-Paris and Istanbul, the Bishops on Madrid and London, while Knights and pawns covered the sphere members and the Reichskommissariate.\n\n"Gentlemen" the minister for the defence begun, "With the recent end of the Triumvirate, and the collapse of the Reich, our strategic position has changed so much that we can no longer be certain of anything" he pointed at the King on the map: "If we are to protect our country, we need to understand where our true priorities lay" then he pointed at the files. "Courtesy of the SIM" to which a man in ordinary clothes nodded slightly, "We have gathered a good amount of initial data concerning the most imminent threats to our security. With our forces strained to protect our borders" and he nodded towards the chief of the General Staff, "We need to decide our priorities" then, looking at the undersecretary for foreign affairs, "Our diplomatic corps have sent us a summary of what other countries think about our new government, and what we can expect from them"\n\n"The only way we can avoid being swallowed by chaos, is by flawlessly planning our every move. No mistake is allowed! The tiniest miscalculation could see Italy alone and weakened against foes we know nothing about. Now, let's get to work!" all men nodded, and the chattering begun."

A boat, French passports, ten thousand francs and scuba diving equipment are a rather... unusual combination, to put it mildly"\n\nVolpe chuckled: "The boat brought us from Genoa to Marseille, where we pretended to be Italo-French coming from Nice to see their families in Paris. At night, we bribed the sewer maintenance personnel in West Paris to let us submerge in the drainage pipes, then followed them to the Seine and re-emerged in Ost-Paris, where men of the slave resistance in contact with the SIM brought us out of the city. From there, it was mostly a matter of not being spotted, though the surveillance inside is less strict: they are so sure no one can get in, that they don't see the need to hide their operation from prying eyes... Then, we returned through the same way"\n\nMonviso laughed heartily for once, and got up from his chair to pat Volpe's shoulder: "Well done, Volpe, well done!

The Reich has begun rearming itself. For what purpose, one can only guess: some argue that a reconquest of the rebel Reichskommissariate is near, others believe that they are trying to exert their influence over Eastern Europe once more, while a few fear more... sinister intentions from the new regime in Germania. \n\nIn the end, until more detailed information comes, it's impossible to discern the ultimate goal of the new Germany, but the data is more than enough to understand how they want to pursue it, and devise countermeasures. For each new weapon developed, something capable of rendering it useless, for each new tactic devised, a plan to counter it, for each new division raised, a brigade trained to hold the line.

"Citizens of Sirte!" he shouted in the local tongue, taught to him by his mother as most meticci, "By decree of the government, anyone - yes, anyone! - willing can join the army to fight for our country!"

"This!" the soldier yelled over the crowd, "This is how they treat your people - OUR people - outside of Italy!" Rage filled the square. "These people - these MONSTERS - will never be satisfied!

Umberto II had been invited by Gaddafi too, but politely declined due to "very delicate and undelayable State matters".\n\nThe camel caravan entered the town in a flurry of trumpets, exotic beasts from Gaddafi's own serraglio, and servants bringing gifts for the italians: a bedouin gem-encrusted sword for the King in Rome, a golden dagger for the governor and the garrison commander and a silver-hilted combat knife, shaped like those used by the desert fighters, for each of the honour guards. Also, Rolexes for everyone. Because everyone loves a Rolex. How could he get Swiss watches in the desert? This is why he's getting the office: if he can send agents to Switzerland without anyone noticing, he's an asset worth keeping...\n\nThe ceremony was perfect: Mu'ammar Gaddafi kneeled in front of the valet, who conferred upon him his title, a knighthood of the Order of the Holy Annunciation, and a lump sum of money "as a sign of good will for the future of Italy and the desert people, forever bound by friendship".

"Yes dear, I'm finishing!" but the husband was no longer listening, zapping and finally stopping on the Telegiornale, the news channel.\n\nMargherita brought the soup-filled dishes, but suddenly stopped near the TV, the plates still in her hand. "By decree of the ministry of defence" came the anchorman's smooth voice, "Starting today, women can enlist in the army as auxiliaries, drivers and pilots. Further decrees will regulate the eventuality of fully-female fight-" the TV went off. "Bah! Cagate!" came Lorenzo's voice. "Margherita! Don't make me come for you!" he yelled, but his wife was immediately at his side. For the first time in almost two years, a radiant smile was on her face, even covering the latest bruise on her cheek.\n\n"Yes dear, here is your soup" and she poured the steamy fluid onto her husband's head. Lorenzo screamed in pain, and made to get up, but Margherita was faster, crushing the empty plate on his face: the rough ceramic broke, as did the man's nose. "Puttana! Io ti- AAH!" another scream, this time from the woman's foot coming in contact with Lorenzo's private areas once. Then twice. Then in the stomach.

The original birthplace of human civilization, the homeland of the Abrahamic Faiths, the crossroads between the west and east, and its people have played both the role of conqueror as well as that of the conquered. But in the modern day, its power lays just beneath the surface, and takes the form of oil.\n\nOil is the lifeblood of armies, of industries and of nations, and it is our control over the Middle Eastern oil fields that provides Italy with her economic power. But chaos has broken out across the Middle East starting with a civil war in Yemen, and the rebellious fever has spread to Egypt and Syria. Some of these demagogues and renegades are fueled by religious zeal, others by dreams of a single state for the entire Arab world, and others still by simple anti-Monarchist sentiment. As the entire region is thrown into a state of Crisis, we'll need to act decisively to preserve our hold on the region."

Thankfully, we have a number of emergency policies set aside for just such a situation. A band-aid solution until we can custom-tailor a policy that handles the source of the problem, it will at least allow us to act more decisively against the threats to Italy's interests."

More importantly, he's expressed a willingness to work with Italy for the betterment of not just Saudi Arabia, but the entire Arab World.

He was the most decorated soldier from the Second World War, and once again, we'll be relying on him and men like him to save Italy's place in the world.

A failure here will lose us the support of our only stable ally in the region and discredit us globally.

For the governments and armies of the Middle East, it'll be taken as a reassurance that we won't abandon them in their time of crisis, and that we will fight to maintain the power structures that keep them in place as well.

And now that they have feasted on the corpses of Switzerland and Sweden, they are turning their gaze down to the south. We need to remain calm.

This means training them to think quickly and independently, to excel in close quarters and house-to-house fighting.

This new Charter of Labour shall restrict the powers of the business elite over their workers, so that unbridled capitalism shall no longer run roughshod over the working Italian. Those who put in a fair day's labour shall receive the compensation and benefits that they are entitled to. The average Italian has placed his trust in the state, and the state shall not betray that trust any longer!\n\nNot only that, but all these corporations shall no longer be allowed to solely pursue their own goals, even if that means working against the goals of the state.

The central problem that we face comes from economists. They seem to mistakenly believe that the Italian Government is too centered around taxation, and that even individual spending can't maintain it. Even more, they think that this rapid abolishment will lead to hyper-inflation and a total economic collapse! What fools they are.

He felt powerless, like the commander of a besieged castle, unable to do anything other than look his enemies prepare for the final assault.\n\nHis head shot up. Yes! A castle! Perhaps he couldn't influence the way the crisis would start, but surely he could erect walls, shore up the defences so that the country might survive the storm! Italy needed to become an economic fortress, impregnable and independent from foreign influence, and there was only one way to achieve this: autarky, Mussolini's very own invention, would return to the forefront of Italian economics. "Aldo!" he startled his secretary, "call immediately the Minister for the Economic Affairs! I don't care if he's sleeping, there's work to be done!" to which the man nodded and left the room. Carlo Scorza finally relaxed on his chair: now, everything was a bit clearer."

Carlo Scorza nodded his head in recognition, then motioned for the fifteen men to sit on the plush armchairs his private secretary had prepared in advance. "Aldo, would you please bring us refreshments?" he said, to which the efficient aide bowed slightly and left. Then, he looked at the man sitting directly in front of him: "Minister Zerbino, I'm anxious to know the result of our autarchic measures: I believe you have all the information I need"\n\n"Sì, mio Duce" Paolo Zerbino said, and hurriedly opened his suitcase, extracting a voluminous report: "As you can see, our efforts have been paying out: resource extraction has dramatically increased both in the mainland and in the other parts of our Empire, and industrial production is constantly growing all across our possessions. While it will take time to ensure full agricultural independence, we are confident that the new rationalisation reforms, and research on high-yield crops and fertilisers, will give us what we need" then, he nodded to one of the members of the planning board, who begun to talk in detail about the reforms and their results. When all had finished, the Duce lightly clapped his hands: "I'm proud of you, gentlemen! With what you have done, we managed to ensure Italy's survival even in the most dramatic circumstances" to which the Minister couldn't stop bowing in gratitude.After all had left, the Duce allowed himself a small joke as he thought of his Minister: a competent man indeed, but perhaps a bit too... willing to serve."
 nscorza.1002.a:0 "Zerbino di nome e di fatto..."
 
 nscorza.1003.t:0 "An ordinary day in a new Empire"
 nscorza.1003.d:0 "Ladies and gentlemen, this is your faithful Giorgio Vecchietti of the Telegiornale RAI! As you all know, the past years have been hard on our beautiful country: from the war reconstruction, to the German betrayal at Gibraltar, our proud people had to face many challenges. But no longer! Under the strong guidance of our Duce Carlo Scorza, Italy has been reborn, and now he leads the way towards a brighter future!\n\nAs you look around, you can only see new factories opening, and new business setting up shop all throughout the Boot. Not just mainland Italy, but the entirety of our Empire is experiencing a new golden age of prosperity: in Suez, the naval traffic has increased tenfold, and from Ethiopia to the Gulf, Italian businessmen and local farmers experience a surge in productivity never seen from the days of the draining of the Pontine Marshes by our Glorious First Duce!\n\nAs the entirety of Italy grows stronger together, it entwines deeper and deeper, until each and every city is inextricably interwoven with the rest of the Empire, creating a new, thriving, and united community which has no precedent in our history! If things keep going this way, ladies and gentlemen, we will stepping closer and closer to our great dream: one day, we shall truly rebuild the Roman Empire! Gloria all'Italia! Gloria al Fascismo! Gloria al Duce!"

As must be natural with any political entity ruling over a sufficiently diverse collection of peoples and conquered territories, cohesion is limited at best. While nominally under the same government, an Imperial citizen living in Naples would likely find himself completely lost in Dubai, or even the more integrated Benghazi. The issue of how to better bring these disparate groups and former nations under one flag will no doubt take a good deal of effort and patience, but achieving the desired unity will likely bring immense reward."

 ita_a_fascist_empire_desc:0 "The Italian Empire was born under Facism, and with Facism it must be inextricably linked if it is to survive. Facism as a beacon of order and stability, not to mention the embodiment of state authority, is a natural system for administering an empire. Just as the Fasci is the collection of many thin sticks into one unbreakable, intractable bundle, so too will our empire bind and merge the collective wills and dreams of all our subjects under the banner of one state. The eagle shall forever more be perched on the shoulder of Mother Italia, safeguarding her wherever she may journey!"

The Nazis may be so short sighted and stubborn to take all who are worth taking based on their own racial theories but the true and modern Fascist state is under no such illogical constraints. Duce Scorza has ordered the creation of programs that will promote those with desirable qualities from amongst the farthest reaches of the Empire."

These policies were implemented despite the fact that it was very rare to see resources being diverted to Italian language education in the colonies and territories, making the whole thing a bit of a joke, a symbolic relic of the idea of cultural supremacy that was prevalent at that time. Times have changed though, and Duce Scorza recognizes that in such an empire as he has, languages will be spoken whether or not they are officially allowed. Removing these outdated bans would just be better for everyone involved."

It is the seat of the Emperor and the heart from which the Empire flows, but it does not claim to be the only part of the empire that matters.

Now, some half a century later, the spirit of this organization has been resurrected as we seek to reevaluate our commitments to the world stage.

The Jews were correctly understood to be our enemies once, and they will be once again recognized as such. They do not deserve public office, or any benefits that the state can provide, for these belong to true citizens. We understand that the Germans do not view us as true Aryans but this is simply their desire to keep all to themselves. We are, by virtue of our blood, as Aryan as any of them, and perhaps even more if some of the foremost scientists of the races are to be believed.

Or rather, the Roman's were the greatest empire, for we are their final and indisputable heirs and have even surpassed them. It is the right, and even the duty, of Italy to prosper. As we have seen, when Italy prospers, all of humanity does so too. We shall not dissemble, but instead stride forward into the bright future with confidence and the winds of fortune at our backs.

No, the truth that has been revealed by the modern world is that the only thing worth pursuing as a state is power, and that the exercise of that power is the ultimate goal. Those who would seek to dissuade us from such a path reveal themselves as either cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Look at what the Germans accomplished! While Ciano persuaded Mussolini to follow more high minded ideals the Reich swallowed almost all of Europe and Africa, leaving us with the scraps. Duce Scorza has learned the lesson of this event well, and the next time around, it will be Italy doing the taking while all others watch in impotence."

We earned our territory through blood and sweat, and we shall not let it go until the last Italian man has fallen in defense of the Empire's integrity.

Our efforts in the Second World War have paid off at least enough to give us the Empire Mussolini dreamed of. Still, when we can take an inch, why not take a mile? We scrapped and fought and bled for this much, Duce Scorza would rather die than see it given up, and he would dedicate even more blood and toil to expand it."

If we can just make them understand the benefits of working within the empire for their own good, we have no doubt that they will come around and prove to be responsive to our authority and beliefs in due time.\n\nWhile some local leaders may feel as if we are attempting to coral them into obedience, we can afford to patiently lay out the benefits of staying with a more advanced state, and the danger of heading off on their own into the cruel, lonely world."

 ita_new_undesirables:0 "New Undesirables"
 ita_new_undesirables_desc:0 "Every good story needs a villain just as much as it needs a hero. With our recent efforts to remove those who were already cast as villains, namely the Jews, to other locales some of Duce Scorza's advisors feel it is time for a new foe to be brought to the people's attention. Perhaps the Arabs should be next on our list, or German refugees from the Civil War? Whatever we decide upon, we can quickly begin to distribute learning materials to all of our citizens that show just what a threat to the Italian way of life that group is. The late Dr. Goebbels of the Reich was quite adept at such tactics, and we could easily take the techniques he pioneered and use them for our own benefit."

 ita_united_under_the_tricolor:0 "United Under The Tricolor"
 ita_united_under_the_tricolor_desc:0 "As an empire that is one whole made of many diverse pieces. We require something to rally behind. Choosing any one specific ideology or belief system could alienate other groups. What we have that could rally all our people is our beautiful flag. Red, white, and green with the crest of the House of Savoy, it is a beacon of light amidst the dark of Europe and indeed the world. Our subjects view us as one would a father, we are committed to our duty as their benevolent masters."

 ita_the_politcal_absolute:0 "The Political Absolute"
 ita_the_politcal_absolute_desc:0 "When considering policies, Duce Scorza only has one political criteria: is it for the good of the state and the Empire; for Fascism? That is all that truly matters, the improvement of Italy. Fascism should not care about whether it goes against the racial orthodox or tradition. Fascism after all, is a state focused ideology first and foremost, and if the state is being held back by outdated beliefs then it is within the power of Fascism to throw them out. In the circles of the Italian government, it is called the "Political Absolute" for it is the one true metric through which everything must be judged through."

To those who quickly submit and assimilate as best they can, we can gain a good deal of goodwill by allowing some degree of autonomy and support to flow. This will incentivize other subjects to cooperate further. However, in cases where the natives prove stubborn and intractable, we will have no choice and should not regret coming down quickly and powerfully. One should rarely make threats after all, but those threats must be credibly backed."

From there, they will strike against the very nation they had sworn to protect, and we'll be quick to point our accusing finger against those who truly want to harm Italy.\n\nAll it takes is some forged evidence, some dead civilians - just to enrage the population - and like magic, extremists who have managed to hide as well-integrated members of society will be exposed and forced to pay, even if it will be for a different crime.\n\nIn the next years, perhaps even decades, hundreds of innocents will die by our hands, and in the end we won't feel any remorse, because no sacrifice is too small for our country!"

 ita_lift_martial_law_desc:0 "With the last remnants of terrorists, traitors, extremists and anarchists finally annihilated, the army can return to the barracks, and leave the civilian matters to the civilian government and the Polizia Municipale. As such, effective immediately, the martial law is lifted. While limitations to public gatherings and manifestation of dissent will remain in place for at least a couple more months depending on how the situation evolves, we plan to immediately start the transition process towards the restoration of democracy."
 
 ita_merzagoras_speech:0 "Merzagora's Speech"
 ita_merzagoras_speech_desc:0 "The first step of our planned return to normalcy is to change the face of the emergency government: while it has served us well, its members are widely unpopular due to the extremely harsh measures they had to approve. Of course, it's not as if they could have refused...\n\nThe perfect candidate for the role of "new face" of the emergency government is Cesare Merzagora: a moderate liberal, well known and respected but without any true political influence, he is sure not to cause any problems. As soon as he swears his oath in the King's hands, he will start preparing for the transition from the state of emergency, to ordinary administration."
 
 ita_speak_to_PDIUM:0 "Speak to PDIUM"
 ita_speak_to_PDIUM_desc:0 "The PDIUM is a fervent monarchist party, bent on remaining within the Constitutional Arc, which has taken the place of the now purged BN as the new leader of the right. While their loyalty to the Crown is not under scrutiny, convinced monarchists usually have rather authoritarian tendencies, and may or may not wish to make the King their pawn.\n\nFortunately - for them - this is not the case with the PDIUM, and we have began talks with Lauro to set the stage for the now imminent return to normalcy. Their support will greatly help in restoring trust in democracy, especially in the political right."

Now, the final stage our Piano Solo will take place: the King shall appoint a second cabinet of technocrats, people with the knowledge and competence needed to manage the reconstruction of Italy's political institutions and the legal groundwork for the future elections.\n\nWe have chosen the right people, and the provisory Prime Minister is scheduled to resign in a few days, as soon as all the needed pieces have been set in place. While the new ministers prepare the ground, we will begin talks with what remains of the Constitutional Arc, parlaying with the moderate parties to ensure a peaceful and smooth transition towards full democracy."

Some of our generals wished to "purge every last bit of socialism from Italy", but we are different from the fascists: our duty is to remove extremists, terrorists and traitors, not to judge the merit of one's ideology.\n\nSaragat has been summoned to the provisory Prime Minister's office, and our men will be present to "convince" him to grant us his party's support: this should placate most of the surviving political left, and ensure they find an outlet for their beliefs other than terrorism."
 
 ita_speak_to_DC:0 "Speak to DC"
 ita_speak_to_DC_desc:0 "The DC is the most moderate party in the Constitutional Arc, and therefore the less untrustworthy in our eyes: we will meet with Fanfani and his men, so that we may lay the foundation of the government set to take the place of the technocrats once this is all over. They don't trust us, that is certain, but they will do what they must, if they care about democracy, and their lives: we have been merciful towards those who were strangers to the attempted coup, but our patience has a limit. We'll let them prove their loyalty to democracy, and grant them our stamp of approval, as long as they do whatever they can from now on to stop the madmen who almost threw our country into total chaos"

We will now ensure that Piano Solo fades forever into nothingness, a shameful secret soon to be lost into the darkest recesses of the deepest military archives.\n\n Democracy will return.\n\nPerhaps it will never be the same again. Perhaps it will heal, in time.\n\nAfter all, protecting democracy is like guarding a tiny, pure, beautiful flower: in the end, it doesn't matter if the flower loses a petal or two, as long as it remains alive so that, one day, it may grow again."

Yet our decision is also one with immense geopolitical implications.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the §BUnited States of America§! salivates at the thought of a strong §BOFN§! ally on the German border.

Yet our offer to join the §YCo-Prosperity Sphere§! is better. Against §BDC's§! promises of democratic solidarity, we offer monetary gain; that, and the security of an alliance with the §YJapanese Empire§!."

 ita_the_status_of_the_economy_desc:0 "The Italian economy has, since Atlantropa, never been incredibly stable. The receding waters ruined our former port cities, and only trade with our Triumvirate allies allowed the Italian economy to remain afloat. However, with the collapse of the Triumvirate, we are left in a very precarious position.\n\nThankfully, all is not lost. With the Mediterranean waters having finished receding, new port cities will not become obsolete in a matter of years. Furthermore, with Italy's expanding industry and control over major trade routes, such as the Suez Canal, we can build up our economy so that the loss of Iberia and Turkey as trading partners will not be the economic death blow that our enemies wish it to be! "

 ita_the_pillars:0 "The Pillars"
 ita_the_pillars_desc:0 "The modern Italian economy is held up by two primary pillars: industry and agriculture. While both pillars aren't in a dire state, the collapse of the Triumvirate requires us to invest more into our domestic industry so that the pillars can successfully do their job of holding up the Italian economy. We must finish modernizing agriculture, and tap into the wealth of industry that Italy holds. Of course, our infrastructure will be built up even more to support the increased amount of materials that will soon flow through Italy. Our pillars will become unshakeable, for not even the strongest economic earthquake will make them fall!"

 ita_la_seconda_battaglia_del_grano_desc:0 "The First Battle for Grain was one of the many Battles that Benito Mussolini began in the 1920s. While it was successful at greatly increasing production of necessary foodstuffs, it also led to the decline of major Italian exports such as cheese and wine. While it is becoming clear that we must fight a Second Battle for Grain, we must strike a balance. Old farms shall be rejuvenated from near-death, land shall be cleared for new farms, and we shall provide these new farms with modern agricultural equipment! Of course, we will also remind the established farmers that there is much money to be made in not just grain or cereal, but in the finer luxuries. This balance might be much harder to strike, but it should hopefully lead to a more economically independent and prosperous Italy!"

 ita_conclude_the_mechanization_of_agriculture:0 "Conclude The Mechanization Of Agriculture"
 ita_conclude_the_mechanization_of_agriculture_desc:0 "Italian agriculture has always been critical to the economy. We have always tried to make sure that the farmers are able to farm successfully, and we have helped the peasants evolve into farmers by modernizing them. However, not all of Italian agriculture is mechanized. There are still people who use horses to farm, and the idea of things such as tractors are far-fetched to them. Thankfully, there are only a few farms that have not been mechanized, so a push to finish modernizing agriculture shouldn't be too expensive. Finishing this modernization of Italian agriculture will be critical to helping advance the Italian economy into the modern era.\n\nOf course, we will not merely uplift those who do not have agricultural technology.

We must rectify this issue by modernizing our railway system and by phasing out the old trains. Of course, we cannot focus purely on trains if we are modernizing infrastructure. The Italian roads, the pride and glory of the old Roman Empire, must be modernized as well. New roads shall be built across the Adriatic salt flats, and existing roads shall be upgraded to reflect a new and modern Italy.

Secondly, the urban unemployed, of whom there are far too many in Italy's great cities. Thirdly, the rural poor, who struggle to get by despite being the ones to feed Italy.

Their personal convictions, ideals, motives can all melt away as snow under the sun, once they've been shown a sufficient amount of Lire - and surely their friends being taken away is a small loss compared to the Duce can give them in exchange."

 ita_expand_the_colonie_di_confino_desc:0 "Since the rise of Mussolini, the fascist regime has extensively used the Colonie di Confino as a tool to repress political dissent. Usually taking the shape of prisons located in tiny Mediterranean islands or other similarly remote locations, the Colonie di Confino are were political enemies of fascism are made to regret their unfortunate political decisions through harsh forced labour. We must expand and perfect this tried and true system, turning the Colonie into proper concentration camps where we can store hundreds of enemies of the state, rendering them not only innocuous, but also using their labour for the benefit of the fatherland. If the Nazis could build a fortune on the backs of forced labourers, so can we."

 ita_lock_down_the_PNF_desc:0 "In times of political crisis such as these, it is essential for us to know that we can rely on the structures of the state - and no structure is more important than the PNF. In the past, personal interests, opportunism, and internal divisions have undermined the unity and obedience of the party. Now, the Duce has decided that the PNF must return to be what it was designed to be - a monolithic, indestructible bloc of people who are willing to pledge the utmost personal loyalty to the Duce of fascism. Enforcing mass purges in the lower ranks and solidifying the hierarchy of the upper ranks will restore the lost unity of the party and the nation, demanding nothing short of complete, total submission to Scorza himself."

 ita_mobilize_the_regio_esercito_desc:0 "The Blackshirts have always proven unreliable at best and ineffective at worst - over the years, the MVSN has lost much of its original usefulness, becoming little less than an appendage to our armed forces, and it's staffed mainly by old nostalgics who still love to remember the march on Rome and by young, clueless fanatics. While useful to repress rabbles, the MVSN is not something we can rely on for more complicated matters - the Regio Esercito, particularly its intelligence and secret services divisions, will be instead put on high alert to deal with disturbances to public order across the empire. We shall schedule meetings with generals and reshuffle resources to make sure the army has all the funding they need to ensure peace and stability."

People who have been singled out as potential threats and have refused to budge to our offers can always be dealt with in other ways. We shall instruct OVRA to conduct a mass campaign of terror and purges both inside and outside the state apparatus. People shall be kidnapped, deported, and disappeared overnight, never to be seen again - their families and associates living in constant fear that the same fate might befall them. Everyone will be scared of their neighbours and friends being potential informants, and we'll make sure everyone knows what is going to happen to them should they fail to meet the simple demand that our Duce makes to the Italian people - obey."

We shall create a state of perennial fear and paranoia into the government and the population - making sure they know very well that out there, people far scarier than us are out to get them. Terrorists, anarchists, criminals, bandits, subhumans, all attempting to prey on the prosperity of the fascist Italian empire. Surely, the Italian people will tolerate the increased repression and fear once they see that there is no other choice beyond this, or complete anarchy and chaos."
 
 ita_expand_army_funding:0 "Expand Army Funding"
 ita_expand_army_funding_desc:0 "If Italy is to be able to project power in its sphere, not to mention within the country, the Army will need our support. The Army's stagnation is not just a stain on Fascism; it encourages the Germans to encroach into our sphere of influence, and makes the countries around us not take us seriously. The course ahead is clear enough. We shall do whatever it takes to increase the funding available to the Army, so that we can upgrade our technological capacity, drill more discipline into the ranks, and bring fear to the enemies of our nation within and without. A Fascist Army is a strong army; there is no other way."
 
 ita_expand_police_operations:0 "Expand Police Operations"
 ita_expand_police_operations_desc:0 "The police, a continuing support base for Fascism at the lower and higher levels, is too constrained to carry out its crucial work. Even now, at various levels of the police hierarchy, a great degree of bureaucracy constrains them from finding subversive and criminal activity and stamping it out. We shall expand significantly police operations, by cutting down on much of this bureaucracy and reasserting the primacy of the police over the public sphere. If a criminal or terrorist is foolish enough to continue their subversion, under this new order, he shall do so with the fear or being beaten to a bloody pulp by the first officer to look his way. The Police will certainly be grateful for the trust placed in them by the Duce."

By enacting curfews across our country, we can kill two birds with one stone - ensuring a more disciplined society whilst making it easier to suppress any subversive groups operating by night. We shall prepare for this by passing a series of laws, making it illegal to leave the household by night except without express permission from above. We will also embark on a communication blitz on the dangers of criminal and degenerate behaviour left too long on our streets. This will convince the people on the need for wide police powers to wipe such scum off the face of the earth."

 ita_solidify_the_hierarchy_desc:0 "Under Ciano the very foundation of Italian Fascism, the clear hierarchy of power on which a stable society is built, was left to rot away under years of permissive government. No more. The only way to build a strong Italy is to revive the privileges of the ruler, and to obtain the consent or submission of the ruled. We shall do this by solidifying the hierarchy of power in every area of life; whether in the party structure, the military, police, the administration and society generally, we will establish discipline and rank under threat of punitive punishment. By massively increasing punishment for people rebelling against their betters, we will drill into the people a simple truth. An Italian who does not conform to his or her place in society is not fit to be part of it."

 ita_friends_in_the_church_desc:0 "The Church's hold over the Italian population has remained over the last decades, and does not show any sign of abating. To stay the masters of Italy, we must also master an institution which dictates public morality. Following in Mussolini's footsteps, we shall create a new Concordat with the Church - mobilising our allies close to the Throne of St Peter, we shall remind every priest who will listen that our aims are very similar indeed. To hold the people of Italy steadfast against atheism and liberalism, to maintain their faith in the natural order of master and servant, and to keep them in submission to God the Father; these are crucial to control the soul of Italy. Our friends in the Vatican will understand that a renewed Fascist movement can only be an ally to the Church."

 ita_friends_in_big_business_desc:0 "Just as the fate of the Church will have its impact on Italians' souls, so the fate of the economy will dictate the most intimate details of their daily life. The assorted Capos of Big Business have been split in the past on Ciano's reformist mindset, and it falls to us to remind them of the benefits of Fascist corporatism as the basis of our economic system. We shall let our friends know that we will always have an ear for the concerns of industry, committed as we are to creating wealth and furthering economic growth. Whether this requires us to use words and assurances, or to speak to the industrial bosses in the language they truly understand - suitcases filled with money - is unimportant. What matters is results. So long as they understand this, Italy will enrich its friends in business and in return become once more a strong, prosperous economy."

 ita_friends_in_the_court_desc:0 "Whilst some in the Fascist movement flirted with republicanism in the past, we have long come to see the King's value as a unifying figure. The King reminds people of the difference between those who rule and those who serve. He also serves the idea of stability in times which have been little but. Now that we have prevailed over the petty intrigues of the court, we shall empower our allies around King Umberto even further, purging any remaining liberals and reformists. Shorn of anyone with an inkling of doubt in the fascist renewal, Umberto will fold, as he did all those years ago, and do exactly as our friends tell him. It is below the King's dignity to involve himself in politics, after all. He shall watch as the real masters of Italy do the dirty work."
 
 ita_friends_in_the_army:0 "Friends in the Army"
 ita_friends_in_the_army_desc:0 "There has long been mistrust between the Duce and the Army, especially those in the top ranks. Unlike many other power centres in Italy, a dissatisfied and independent army can do more than simply protest - if we are weak enough, it may step in and break apart everything we have built since Verona. We know what we must do. There are good men in the middling ranks Army, men overlooked in recent years for being too 'old-fashioned' yet too competent to leave languishing in the lower ranks. It is on these grieved men, torch-carriers for the bellicose spirit of Fascism, that we will remould the Army. We shall encourage the retirement of some older and more high-ranking generals, replacing them with our friends and allies. Yet we will do it in a manner in which no one may protest. For who would argue against the renewal of our martial forces with fresh blood?"
 
 ita_for_god:0 "For God"
 ita_for_god_desc:0 "Our faith in God and His Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church is the heart of our project, the restoration of true, strong Fascism in Italy. For too long have the tendrils of a destructive ideology, that of liberal individualism and the atheism it creates, remained beneath the surface of Italian society, waiting for its moment in the sun. Yet now things will change once and for all, so they can remain the same. In God's name we have built a social order in our country based on piety, hierarchy, unity, and submission to power. For His Glory we will not allow any trace of atheist arrogance, or meaningless talk of individual freedoms, to push us off the path of the faithful. For a union of Fascism and Catholicism as an omnipotent, omnipresent force in the lives of Italians, there will be no more compromise with the godless."
 
 ita_for_the_king:0 "For the King"
 ita_for_the_king_desc:0 "Now that King Umberto has been bent to our will, we can only celebrate everything the Monarchy represents for our country. Decades ago the House of Savoia announced its claim over all of Italy, but it took an expedition of real men, men willing to act, to deliver the Kingdom to them. Now that the liberal spirits of Savoy are dead and buried, we pledge ourselves loyal subjects of the King. So long as Umberto remains true to the ideals of Fascism reborn, a Fascism which will make Italy strong and burn away any branch which would go against us, we will also remain faithful to the Monarchy. We need only remind the Monarch of this arrangement, and everything will fall into place."

 ita_for_italy_desc:0 "When Mussolini marched on Rome forty years ago, his victory was not assured beforehand. When Duce Scorza stood up to challenge the great man's successor, the victory was not assured either. Yet with iron will and unwavering spirit both Mussolini and his true son, Scorza, triumphed. For Italy we have shed our blood and sweat. We have thrown everything we had at the enemies without and within, and we are on the cusp now of greatness. Long live Italy! Woe to the vanquished! Long life to its Duce Carlo Scorza, to his idea of an Italy which is stronger than ever before, which is good to Italians and merciless with its enemies! For Italy we march onwards against any nation, any group that is foolish enough to block our path. Through the bowed head of a King was Fascist Italy born decades ago. Through the bowed head of every Italian now will Fascist Italy be reborn."

 ITABOE.1.d:0 "Despite the military's best attempt at maintaining a détente between the royalist and fascist elements of the officer class, the same cannot be said about the rank-and-file. Italy's sons from all walks of life proudly serve in the Army, which means that there is a high chance of soldiers finding out their bunkmate professes some... interesting political theories.\n\nSuch was the case today in a training camp outside of Napoli, where these tensions came to a boiling point and devolved into physical violence. According to the officers' reports, one of the cadets noticed that someone had moved a portrait of the Duce on the wall so that it sits above that of the King. When he loudly demanded to know who did it, the offending cadet proudly stood up and took responsibility. The argument quickly grew heated, punches were thrown, and their squadmates jumped into the fray. While the military police were quickly called to defuse the situation and arrest the instigators, the story has spread rapidly, with some alterations. Fascists are painting it as a brave patriot standing up to a subversive conspiracy, while monarchists insist it was the work of a treasonous cur with no respect for tradition. The government needs to take a stance on the issue, and soon."
 ITABOE.1.a:0 "We are still a monarchy, no?"
 ITABOE.1.b:0 "No man is equal to the Duce!"
 ITABOE.1.c:0 "Why should we care about interior decoration?"

 ITABOE.2.t:0 "What's In A Name?"
 ITABOE.2.d:0 "The Regia Marina, our Royal Navy, has proudly patrolled the Mediterranean and defended the shores of our Patria for a century. Many are proud to say they serve, but some are less proud than others. Not because they hate the sea or their homeland, but because of its name. Specifically, the fact that it is the Royal Navy.\n\nA group of very ideologically motivated submarine captains have begun circulating a letter among their comrades, one that descries the monarchist implications of the Regia Marina's name. They accuse it of every single ideological crime under the sun, from undermining sailors' morale to encouraging anti-fascist partisan activity. The letter concludes with a demand that the name be changed "at the early possible convenience of the Grand Council," urging them to "remember that this is the navy of the Italian people and Empire, not a lone Savoyard!" While nobody in the Grand Council has any serious designs to change the Regia Marina's name, some form of response is expected."
 ITABOE.2.a:0 "Dismiss this silly petition at once."
 ITABOE.2.b:0 "Promise to consider it at some point."

 ITABOE.3.t:0 "Hands Down"
 ITABOE.3.d:0 "During a state dinner attended by Prince Ferdinando, duke of Genoa, Prince Filiberto, duke of Pistoia, and Prince Eugenio, duke of Ancona, as well as many members of the military's high command, counter admiral Borghese caused quite a diplomatic stir when he saluted and shook hands with Princes Ferdinando and Filiberto upon their arrival, but conspicuously only shook the hand of Prince Eugenio. When questioned by one of his fellow generals about the action, Borghese replied, "The Prince is only a colonel. In what world should a counter admiral be expected to salute his subordinates?"\n\nNeedless to say, this was not received very well by the rest of the officer corps, and Edgardo Sogno, also present at the dinner, has led the charge in demanding Borghese receive some form of censure for his insubordination. Although Borghese will not receive anything more severe than a slap on the wrist regardless of the outcome-he is too strategically vital-an official stance needs to be taken on whether nobility in the military should receive the same honors as those at the top of the normal hierarchy."
 ITABOE.3.a:0 "He should've shown more respect to his betters."
 ITABOE.3.b:0 "Salute the rank, not the name."

They are the union most closely aligned with our ideals for labour, and it is important that they remain strong. We have made it clear that we are more willing to work with them than the other unions, and this has caused them to grow at the expense of unions less aligned with us."

It operates on every level of the economy and holds sway over most of Italy's mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. With DC loyalists installed into the IRI's most important positions, the conglomeration has been brought to heel. From this day forward it will now work for the needs of the people instead of the corrupt bureaucrats who once ran it."

If our government lacks unity, it is certain that it will not be able to function. Vice versa, if our government has a high level of unity, it will most certainly function at an incredible level! Such a high level of unity is desired by all in the DC, from the average voter to Aldo Moro himself."

 ita_a_victory_for_democrazia_cristiana_desc:0 "It is truly a momentous day for Italy, as Democrazia Cristiana has prevailed in Italy's first post-fascism election!\n\nOf course, winning an election is a simple thing. What comes after, that is hard. Now, comes the task of governing a country that has been steeped in fascism for decades. A big-tent coalition of the centre, DC, as many big-tent parties, contains several factions and sub-factions within it. With both progressive and conservative factions jostling for influence within the party, it remains to be seen how they will govern now that the election is won..."
 
 ita_the_domus_mariae:0 "The Domus Mariae Congress"
 ita_the_domus_mariae_desc:0 "Democrazia Cristiana has won Italy's first election since the end of fascism! Of course, now that the post-victory euphoria has subsided, the party must get to work and actually govern. Though naturally, the different factions in the party have varying ideas of what this governing should entail...\n\nWith this in mind, incoming prime minister Aldo Moro has called for the party to have a congress in Rome, to determine the new government's path forward. Will Moro bow to the conservative faction for the sake of electability? Or will he push for a more radical programme like the reformists desire, even if that jeopardizes the government's prospects for the next election? Rome wasn't built in a day, after all."
 ita_the_domus_mariae_tt:0 "We will decide the future of the DC."
 ita_walk_the_tightrope:0 "Walk the Tightrope"
 ita_walk_the_tightrope_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Domus Mariae Congress, it appears that Aldo Moro is prepared to hear out the conservative faction of the party. Prominent voices on this wing of the party include Mariano Rumor and Emilio Colombo of the liberal conservative Dorotei faction, as well as Giulio Andreotti of the more right-wing conservative Primavera faction.\n\nWhilst Moro is yet to decide on the next course of action, it appears that he wants to make an effort to unite his party first and foremost. A house divided cannot stand, as they say. Though the path he pursues may depend on what exactly is asked of him by the conservatives..."

 
 ita_cerchiobottismo:0 "Cheriobottismo"
 ita_cerchiobottismo_desc:0 "In order to govern, Aldo Moro must run with the hare and hunt with the hounds! In a party as big and fractious as Democrazia Cristiana, Aldo Moro has his work cut out for him in bringing the party together. After opting to listen to the conservative wing of his party, he has, for now, adopted an opportunistic policy of remaining on the fence. This has kept the party together for now, but it is doubtful it can go on forever.\n\nNow, however, Moro must make a choice for the road ahead. Where should his focus lie? Should he focus on building unity in DC and making a stronger, more effective party, even if it jeopardizes future re-election? Or perhaps the best option is to make some deals with the smaller parties in parliament? Whilst this would undoubtedly make it easier for DC to stay in government, there would inevitably be an impact on the government's programme as the smaller parties demand concessions..."
 
 ita_the_biggest_tent:0 "The Biggest Tent"
 ita_the_biggest_tent_desc:0 "After careful deliberation, prime minister Aldo Moro has decided the best path forward for Democrazia Cristina, already a 'big tent' party, is to expand the 'tent' to include the myriad of smaller parties in parliament.\n\nOf course, these parties will not back the government for nothing. They will expect some concessions in return, whether these are specific policies they want implemented, cabinet positions, or any combination of the two. It will undoubtedly be less effective than if DC were able to govern without a coalition. But by attracting voters from across the political arena to DC, the party will assuredly bolster its chances of re-election and continuing its agenda for another term."
 
 ita_sway_the_PDIUM:0 "Sway the PDIUM"
 ita_sway_the_PDIUM_desc:0 "Now comes the task of bringing the smaller parties on board. One of such parties that must be brought into the fold is the PDIUM, a small party of a monarchist and national conservative bent.\n\nThankfully, they are small enough that we can bring them into our coalition without too many concessions. They will likely be satisfied with a few minor cabinet positions, as well as reassurances from our government that we shall keep our distance from the more radical elements of the Fronte Democratico, such as the Italian Socialist Party. Should we be willing to accommodate them on this, it is likely they shall lend us their support."
 
 ita_republicans_and_socialdemocrats:0 "Republicans and Social Democrats"
 ita_republicans_and_socialdemocrats_desc:0 "Now comes the task of bringing the smaller parties on board. Two such parties that must be brought into the fold are the PRI and the PSDI. The former is a liberal and republican party, whilst the latter is a social democratic party.\n\nBoth parties should be able to be brought into our coalition with relatively few concessions. The PRI will likely be sated with some minor cabinet positions. The PSDI may be a bit harder to persuade, and they may demand some sort of commitment to investing in some government welfare programmes, but nothing that should be insurmountable for us. Should we be willing to accomodate them on this, it is likely that both parties will lend us their support."
 
 ita_brevi_cenni_sull_universo:0 "Brevi Cenni sull'Universo"
 ita_brevi_cenni_sull_universo_desc:0 "Everyone knows that the average voter does not want to be bogged down in the minutiae of our policy proposals. They just want to know A) What we want to do, and B) How it will benefit them. Details be damned!\n\nThus, our legislative programme will intentionally be succinct and vague, and full of grandiose ideas and promises that focus on the big picture. Make sure it appeals to as many sectors of the electorate as possible, but skimp on the details of how we will get there. It's not the journey, but the destination!"
 
 ita_a_true_unity_government:0 "A True Unity Government"
 ita_a_true_unity_government_desc:0 "It has taken quite a bit of wheeling and dealing with the various minor parties in parliament, but it appears that, at long last, Aldo Moro has done it! The negotiations have involved some token concessions to the smaller parties such as some minor cabinet positions and policy proposals, but in the grand scheme of things, this is of no concern.\n\nWhat is more important is that this gives our government legitimacy and electability! The great thing about this coalition government is that it gives off the veneer of an all-encompassing unity government, even when it's solely Democrazia Cristiana calling the shots!"
 
 ita_the_party_of_catholics:0 "The Party of Catholics"
 ita_the_party_of_catholics_desc:0 "After careful deliberation, has decided that the best path forward for Democrazia Cristiana is to strengthen the party and unify it from within. As they say, a house divided on itself cannot stand.\n\nTherefore, the best path forward for DC is for Moro to bring the various factions within the party to heel, allowing the party to effectively govern. By strengthening the party, we will be able to more effectively legislate and implement our government's programme, without having to make outright concessions to or coalitions with other parties. We are the party of all Italians!"
 
 ita_wrangle_the_dorotei:0 "Wrangle the Dorotei"
 ita_wrangle_the_dorotei_desc:0 "Our party has many facets and currents, each with their own ideas on how the DC should rule Italy, and all of them need to remain loyal to both the party and the government: while all currents share most of their program, some points or proposed reforms may be different, or even radically incompatible.\n\nThe Dorotei are one of the largest and most influential currents, known for their connections with the Church and Confindustria - the largest industrial association - and, while we may disapprove of their - sometimes excessive - conservatism, we also know that some concessions need to be made, for the good of Italy.\n\nAs a show of good will towards the Dorotei, the party will officially endorse some of their proposed reforms, and the most important adherents to the current will be appointed as ministerial advisors and secretaries, to ensure their loyalty to the government: if we fall, they will follow us to the end."
 
 ita_contain_the_primavera:0 "Contain the Primavera"
 ita_contain_the_primavera_desc:0 "While we may be able to sway the Dorotei to our cause, the even more conservative Primavera will most likely refuse any offer we send them: they want to be the ones setting the tune of our government, but the DC already has a conductor, and he isn't willing to give up the role, not after all we sacrificed during the dictatorship!\n\nThe instruments are ready, and the orchestra has rehearsed their score: the party newspapers are eagerly waiting to unleash a tidal wave of scandals, vaguely based gossip and suspicious frequentations, involving the top members of the Primavera. While they endure the storm, our envoys will openly decry such a stain on the reputation of the DC, while quietly advising the Church and the industrialist that they should change horse, while they still can...\n\nThe moment has come, Maestro: give us the word and we will sing, for a change of season has long been due."
 
 ita_sway_away_the_ACLI:0 "Sway the ACLI"
 ita_sway_away_the_ACLI_desc:0 "The ACLI (Associazioni Cristiane Lavoratori Italiani) are the more progressive wing of the DC, acting as a bridge between the party and the worker unions and working to keep the latter out of the grasp of more radical leftist ideologies.\n\nWith their political program mostly in line with the government's, it won't be hard to persuade them into officially throwing their lot with us: after all, now that democracy has finally become reality in our country, all should realise how important it is that the first democratic legislature of the Empire doesn't fall into petty squabbling, lest the people start thinking that, after all, fascism was better..."
 
 ita_o_bianco_fiore:0 "O Bianco Fiore!"

Like a beautiful and pure white flower, our rule shall bloom and bring prosperity to the poor and the weak, to those who are alone, and to those who are lost in the multitude.\n\nO bianco fiore, simbol d'amore,\n\ncon te la gloria della vittoria.\n\nO bianco fiore, simbol d'amore,\n\ncon te la pace che sospira il cor!\n\nCon te la pace che sospira il cor!"

Or this is how it should be, if there were any to begin with...In truth, the financial situation of the Empire is far from good: to be fair, it's a miracle how Ciano even managed to make ends meet! The Ministry of the Economy and Finances is a warzone, with each Ministry trying to get one more lira for their promised reforms and subsidies: if this news is revealed, the government will fall, and perhaps democracy with it.\n\nThe Prime Minister has ordered utmost secrecy and caution: while the financial department works, we must distract the public by giving them detailed reports on other fields of progress for our young democracy and, more importantly, reminding them that our direct northern neighbour is a fine example of what happens when things fall apart."
 
 ita_short_term_solutions:0 "Short Term Solutions"
 ita_short_term_solutions_desc:0 "After weeks of guerrilla-like warfare in the Ministry of the Economy and Finances, the finance department has finally drafted up a proposed budget which should keep both the government and the country afloat: the bureaucracy, riddled with the inefficiency and waste so dear to the fascist regime, will be overhauled, removing entrenched - and sometimes actively disloyal - departments and ensuring that the apparatus of the State works with the government, and not against it.\n\nCoincidentially, this will also save a considerable amount of budget funds, which can be employed to fill most gaps in the national finances, and showing the people we haven't forgotten our promises: everyone wins! Except those bureaucrats who lost their jobs..."

 ita_sweeping_promises_desc:0 "We must constantly remind the people that we are working for them: our democracy is still young, and we might need slightly more time to build the paradise we promised, but we are working hard, and we will make it! Until our reforms can be safely passed with full financial covering, the MPs and party leaders will tour Italy and speak to the masses, promising them that we have not forgotten them: it may take time and effort, but we will prevail in the end, and everyone will be happy!"

 ita_tighten_the_belts_desc:0 "While the state coffers are safe, and bankruptcy is no longer the proverbial "convitato di pietra" at cabinet meetings, we will need so much more to actually fulfill our promises. Luckily, our financial department has found a solution for us: the old budget we inherited from the fascists is filled with expensive but useless government programs and subsidies.\n\nCultural initiatives, benefits for party members, bribes masked as subsidies to well-connected industries and banks, this is but the tip of the iceberg of a wide squandering of public funds.\n\nThe draft we received proposes to cut down this jungle of expenses, and we have replied that a machete won't suffice: we will bring a flamethrower."
 
 ita_strengthen_the_CISL:0 "Strengthen CISL"
 ita_strengthen_the_CISL_desc:0 "With the end of the fascist regime, the CGIL fractured, its different currents no longer forced to stay together by the law. Among the many splinters, the CISL (Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Lavoratori), while not the biggest, is closely aligned to our ideas for labour: therefore, we should subtly act to strengthen it, letting the workers know that we will be more willing to discuss labour policies with them rather than the other trade unions.\n\nThis will have the double benefit of taking more workers away from the clutches of communist unions, and limiting the risk of strikes and labour protests."

 ita_christain_ideals_secular_state_desc:0 "The DC is, if the name wasn't eloquent enough, a profoundly christian party: after all, it carries the legacy of Don Luigi Sturzo and the church's Social Doctrine, elevating it into a philosophy of government. This, however, doesn't mean that we are a denominational organisation, or intend to enforce the church's rule over the State: Moro believes in a fully secular State, where everyone is free to practice his or her own religion without fear of persecution, and where the church is fully separated from the State and its agencies.\n\nInstead, the government's action shall naturally fall into the wide river of the christian doctrine: rather than covering roads and cities in crosses and hymns to Jesus, we will follow the true essence of christianity, which is love.\n\nYou don't need to be a christian to love thy neighbour and to be a proud and productive member of society: we will ensure that everyone, no matter their religion or their origin, can live happily in Italy!"
 
 ita_encourage_pluarlism:0 "Encourage Pluralism"

While it may take years, if not decades, to fully abandon this fear, we need to get started immediately.\n\nUnder the government's sponsorship, newspapers and radio programs will be encouraged to hold political analyses and debates, giving people the soft nudge they need to start discussing once more about politics: after all, a democracy where the people don't care about their country's future is a doomed one! Of course, our directives will incentive moderate ideas and debates, which just happen to coincide with our political program..."

Moro is holding important talks with Amintore Fanfani, among the most important members of ID, regarding the expansion of the current: even among other factions and currents, there are men whose ideas closely resemble others, therefore it would be highly beneficial to introduce them into our group. To this end, ID will be structured from a loose collection of people with similar views, to a party-within-the-party, with its own representative organs and a newspaper, so that the current's activities may be more incisive and gather more support among both the wider DC and the people."

Since relationships between our country and both USA and Japan are at least cordial, our films have the potential to be exported to the entire world!\n\nHowever, with the end of fascism lots of production (especially the historical, filo-Roman ones) have been discontinued, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Our government will give incentives to Cinecittà and its many studios to begin new film production, especially the genres which sell the most worldwide: this will bring a triple benefit, as it will at the same time create jobs for the people, bring revenue to the State coffers, and export Italian beauty and culture to the world.\n\nCiac, si gira!"

As such, it is imperative that we put loyal and trusted men in key positions, where they will ensure that the IRI pursues the economic path we are going to set for the country, rather than resisting it: after all, Japan is the perfect example of what happens when the economy and the government clash, and we surely don't want to be the next country with people waiting for their turn to jump off buildings..."

 ita_le_500_lire_di_moro_desc:0 "Moro has come up with a plan to increase budget funds without putting too much of a strain on our already sizeable debt: the government will issue a new category of very small public bonds, whose value should be around 500 Lire, so that anyone, even the poor, may help their country. As an added benefit, we will state that such bonds can be freely exchanged as if they were actual money: this way, they will circulate alongside traditional money, rather than simply rest until they can be exacted, achieving the double result of giving us more money to spend, and generate more trade and revenue."
 
 ita_legge_sabatini:0 "Legge Sabatini"
 ita_legge_sabatini_desc:0 "While Germany stagnates, it is clearer by the day that the new frontier for any advanced nation lies in technological innovation: computers, televisions and other things, which twenty years ago would have been labelled as wizardry, now are seen in every field, from the military to entertainment. The competition among the great nations is merciless, and the cutting edge always moves forward: if we want to remain a world power, we must establish a core Italian innovation industry which doesn't depend on foreign help or know how to develop new technologies.\n\nArmando Sabatini, an MP which strongly supports innovation and industrialisation, has drafted a proposal for tax cuts and other incentives for industries willing to invest in research, development and innovation in the field of mechanics, engineering and electronics: as this coincides with our plans for the economy, we will immediately prioritise it in our parliamentary agenda."
 
 ita_piano_decennale_per_listruzione:0 "Piano Decennale Per L'Istruzione"
 ita_piano_decennale_per_listruzione_desc:0 "While the Riforma Gentile is generally viewed one of the few good things done by the fascist, dramatically increasing alphabetisation especially among the lower classes, there is still large room for improvement. With the steady increase in demand for qualified workers and researchers, it is no longer enough to ensure elementary instruction to farmers and workers' sons: instead, we desperately need people to attend superior schools and universities, so that they may further our quest for innovation.\n\nWhile it is simply impossible to solve our problems with a snap of the fingers, what we can do is plan for the long term: our Piano Decennale per l'Istruzione (Ten-Years Instruction Plans) will set up milestones punctuated by interlocking reforms. If everything goes according to plan, ten years from now we should have a fully functional school systems with increasing higher instruction rates."
 
 ita_abolish_metayage:0 "Abolish Metayage"
 ita_abolish_metayage_desc:0 "The mezzadria (metayage) is an ancient contract between the landowner (concedente) and the farmer (mezzadro) where the former grants the latter the right to cultivate the field, in exchange for half of the harvest. While all is good when the harvest is abundant, when there are droughts or storms and the harvest is ruined, the farmer will starve.\n\nOur modern society cannot stand this cursed remnant of feudalism, and as such our Minister of Agriculture has drafted a reform to abolish metayage, transforming it automatically into an agricultural rent, both helping the poorer farmers and punishing those landowners who exploit their workers."
 
 ita_prevent_financial_bleeding:0 "Prevent Financial Bleeding"
 ita_prevent_financial_bleeding_desc:0 "With the winds of democracy blowing throughout Italy, there are many who profiteered from the past regime who are afraid that we will take their ill-gained money. They are right: while we promised Ciano we wouldn't punish fascists for merely being fascists, we will still prosecute all corrupt officers who took money from the State.\n\nOf course, many of them are already planning to send their capital outside Italy: our agents in Switzerland and the Caribbeans speak of hurried contacts between former fascist officers and banks to accept unspecified sums of money in anonymous accounts. It's almost a pity that tomorrow morning the government will approve a decree which makes it illegal to move capitals superior to one hundred thousand Lire per week, and punishes all banks which refuse to comply with hefty fines..."

Also, there's the problem of bringing up to standard the embrional power lines in the territories we conquered after the war: to this end, we will have ENEL (Ente Nazionale energia ELettrica) establish new hydroelectric plants in the Alps and the Appennini, which will produce power for their respective regions, and give public incentives to those Dalmatian and Albanian industries, often subsidised by ENEL itself, which invest in new power lines for their lands."

 ita_legge_mariotti_desc:0 "With the constant expansion of the healthcare system, we have prepared a draft which will recognise each hospital as a public entity in its own right, with standardised roles and command structures. The Legge Mariotti will also grant incentives and tax cuts to those industries who sell medical supplies at a discount price, and to all people who donate money to build, renovate or expand hospital wings. While it is still a distant dream, one day every city, town or village throughout the Empire will have at least a medic, granting health and a bit of happiness to all!"

 ita_protect_italian_businesses_desc:0 "While our government strongly believes in free trade, Moro is not so foolish as to think that other countries won't try to suffocate our nascent advanced industry in the cradle: to avoid unpleasant incidents, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has drafted a series of decrees which will both protect our industry from aggressive competition, and ensure our own competitiveness in the world market.\n\nTax cuts and public incentives will ensure our businesses will better shoulder the difficulties of foreign dumping and artificially low prices, while a policy of limitations and bans will prevent unscrupulous businessmen from acquiring Italian businesses and forcibly "expatriate" them."

 ita_a_new_italy_before_the_world_desc:0 "It has taken time and effort, it has cost us friends and allies, and we almost lost everything more than once, but finally, the finish line is within sight!\n\nItaly is no longer a brutal dictatorship, but a shining example of democracy and cooperation: even the fact that the last Duce ensured a bloodless transition to free and democratic elections is proof of the Italian Way, where even our most hated enemy is worthy of being treated as an honoured guest, and even the deepest grievances and vendettas can be solved with diplomacy and soft words rather than the rattling of sabers and the firing of guns.\n\nWith our young democracy stable and vibrant with participation, we are ready to face the world head-on, together with nations the likes of the USA and Japan, unafraid of competition, and certain of our inner strengths and unique capabilities. Truly, we are a people of scientists and explorers, conquerors and merchants, but more than anything, we are the Italian People.\n\nViva l'Italia!\n\nViva la democrazia!\n\nViva il Re!"

 ita_tip_the_scales_desc:0 "Some of Moro's advisors have suggested he talks with the more conservative, but numerically powerful, wing of the party, but he has refused: time is short, and with the black clouds covering the sky from Germany we need a strong and free Italy as soon as possible. There's no time for idle negotiations, Italy needs reforms, and we need them now.\n\nFor this reason, we need to rein in the party and ensure that everyone follows the Prime Minister, one way or the other: plans are being drafted to tackle the most problematic elements within the currents, we only need to decide what plan to follow."

 ita_the_progressive_firebrand_desc:0 "The entire propaganda machine of the Iniziativa Democratica is working at full power to sway the public opinion and as many PMs as possible towards supporting the reformist agenda of the government. We have two choices on how to better secure our position: Amintore Fanfani has prepared a rather underhanded plan to force PMs to support us or be forced to resign and forever be banned from any political role within the party and the country, while Pietro Nenni has shown willingness to parley with us and create a common program of progressively oriented reforms, making it easier for us to find a majority, but harder to rein in the rest of the conservative currents."

It's almost a pity that the screams will still be heard. Of course, since we are not so cruel, we'll be sure to call a suitable number of ambulances and paramedics for the inevitable casualties...\n\nAfter Amintore has done his job, and reduced to ash what remains of the Dorotei and the Primavera, we predict that most conservatives who still have a mouth to talk will decide it's best to support our government, if only to get our very own Cursed Dwarf off them for good."

He should ensure that those with a will to fight are "convinced" to go on vacation for the rest of the legislature, and those without can be suitably rewarded for their future support to the government. Another ambulance at the Domus Mariae, please!"

People like Saragat, instead, would be more than willing to see some of their reforms embarked in our program. Fanfani suggests to sow dissent among the more sensible members, so that they will be naturally brought into our fold, weakening their coalition and ultimately facilitating its collapse. As our numbers grow and theirs dwindle, in the end our majority will swallow them all up in exchange for securing their political career..."

 ita_isolate_the_BN_desc:0 "Some members of the Blocchi Nazionali are openly fascist, and wish to return to how Italy was before Ciano ceded his power back to the Italian people. While most members in the BN know and accept this, we might be able to construct "incidents", where the more fascist-oriented declarations of some such members are leaked to the public. The ensuing rage should force the moderates within the party to detach themselves or risk losing what little coherency they have left after consorting with such people...\n\nOf course, we will be right there, ready to welcome them into our government with open arms: after all, everyone who is a friend of Italy and democracy is a friend of ours!"

 ita_dominate_the_Arco_constituzionale_desc:0 "Thanks to Fanfani's schemes, now the majority of the democratic forces within the parliament is forced to work with us or lose face (and political career) entirely: only the harliners of the BN and the remnants of the FD dare to speak against us. Across the board, our planned reforms proceed smoothly towards full approval, and the King is only too happy to promulgate them!\n\nWhile this may prove slightly detrimental in the coming elections (after all, electors usually dislike political scheming, and we did scheme, a lot) it is undeniable that we will be able to present ourselves in front of the Italian people not with a bag full of dreams and promises, but with a country fully democratic and developed for everyone to see and enjoy!"

 ita_sit_with_nenni_desc:0 "While Fanfani's approach would probably more effective on the short term, it will damage our efforts in the long run, exacerbating our opponents and estranging our electors with schemes and daggers in the dark. No, what we need is a proper ally, a progressive and democratic ally who sympathises with our desire for reform, and Nenni and his FD are exactly what we need to turn our dreams for a new Italy into reality.\n\nIn the next few days, we'll meet Nenni and his coalition to draft a common progressive program, encompassing the main reforms we'll be approving together: while there is still room for improvement, and the program may change slightly depending on the evolving situation, in the end we have every reason to believe in a friendly and productive cooperation."

 ita_listen_to_their_demands_desc:0 "While not all reforms proposed by the Fronte Democratico are in line with our plans - some are too radical even for us - we can still include the more acceptable ones into our agenda as a show of good will towards our erstwhile ally. The conservatives within our current may grumble, but in the end this is the only way to keep the government cohesive and fully functional.\n\nMost of the accepted reforms involve protecting minority rights, establishing more subsidies for the poor and overhauling parts of the territorial administration of the Empire, something which can be easily done even though the belt is a bit tight due to our difficult financial situation."

 ita_encourage_the_split_in_the_PSI_desc:0 "Just as we have our conservatives opposed to an alliance with the FD, the Fronte Democratico itself has its own radicals who think that we are too conservatives: while this notion is laughable at best, the PSIUP (Partito Socialista Italiano di Unità Proletaria) is threatening to split from the PSI (Partito Socialista Italiano), and therefore from the coalition, if they sign a pact with us.\n\nIt's almost a pity for them that this is exactly what we want.\n\nAllying with an open-and-proud proletarian socialist party? Our conservatives would begin a civil war. Allying with a reformist party once the PSIUP has seceded? Much more feasible! Therefore, we are going to release a joint statement where Moro and Nenni compliment each other for the future alliance, and slip some details of the new DC-sponsored reforms: this should bring the PSIUP to split in a rage, slightly weakening our ally but strengthening our government."

While this is not our intention, and neither is Nenni's, some MPs from his coalition have actually expressed their intention of "cleansing the army of fascist remnants". While the army would never try a coup (after all, they are too loyal to the King, and the King is on our side), many in our party have connections within the army, and would try to "unplug" our government before it can fall to the temptation...\n\nMoro has scheduled a meeting with Nenni, where he'll remind him that moderation is the key to healthy politics, and surely people talking about army purges are not helping our government: either those rowdy elements are forced into silence, or there may be a big problem within the coalition."

The program has been finalised, and the parliamentary agenda is being minutely drawn so that none has the suspicion of being sidelined in favour of the other. With our large numbers, we can safely approve our reforms without fear of "franchi tiratori": the BN and the PSI may scream from their extremist positions, but that's all they can do to disturb us.\n\nWho knows, perhaps this is the start of something more than a mere alliance of convenience? Only time and politics will tell..."

 ita_enact_the_agenda_desc:0 "With the legislature in full swing, the government's agenda is seeing its first reforms approved: as a show of good will towards the FD, we will start by establishing the foundation of a proper welfare system for the poor and downtrodden. While this will be costly for our finances, we can't deny that there's a dire need for those subsidies, especially since the economic crisis that followed the Atlantropa disaster - damn Germans - is still plaguing the country with its last ugly tendrils.\n\nMoro and Nenni will hold a joint press conference to illustrate the new welfare system and how it will help out those who still live without a job, further increasing the government's popularity in the eyes of the common people."

 ita_rise_of_the_cooperative_desc:0 "Cooperatives have been a staple of leftist narrative of the economy: in a cooperative, there's no "owner", as the workers themselves own the business and organise it according to their own desires and plans, dividing the earnings equally between every worker. As it is one of the less-radical reforms proposed by the FD, the government has decided to draft laws which officially recognise cooperatives, giving them incentives and tax exemptions to help them establish a starting presence in the Italian economy.\n\nWhile it's unlikely cooperatives will supplant the traditional business model, it will be a way to ensure better equality and fairer competition in the cut-throat economic world."
 
 ita_establish_the_regioni:0 "Establish the Regioni"
 ita_establish_the_regioni_desc:0 "After Italy was united, it was decided to keep the administrative units small, establishing only the Comuni, cities, and Province, small unions of comuni, due to the risk of uprising from those still loyal to the old pre-unitary States. Now that Italy is properly united, and none wishes to secede to form the old Grand-Duchy of Tuscany or other nonsensical "nations", we can finally implement the final stage of the administration.\n\nThe Regioni will encompass provinces united by a common heritage, and ensure that the government's policies can be applied uniformly without the need to micromanage hundreds of small bodies: of course, this will entail a certain degree of decentralisation, as the Regioni will have minor legislative powers of their own, something which may greatly enrage the more authoritarian forces within the parliament, but it is an overall sound proposal, especially in the light of the future reforms we have in mind."

 ita_an_empowered_parliament_desc:0 "Even though Italy has become a proper democracy, the parliament's powers are still vaguely defined, especially in the light of the government's powers still granted by the old fascist laws. Our allies in the FD wish to properly and officially state that Italy is a parliamentary democracy, and that it is the parliament - and not the government - to decide the country's policies.\n\nSince this is exactly what we want, and the King is only too happy to promulgate such a law, we will immediately send the draft to His Majesty for a preliminary evaluation, and then the votations will begin in the parliament. With this reform, the last vestiges of fascism will be blown away by the winds of democracy!"
 
 ita_unity_is_strength:0 "Unity is Strength"
 ita_unity_is_strength_desc:0 "In 1920, democracy fell apart because the democratic forces were too divided to offer a joint resistance against Mussolini's March on Rome: we were too busy backstabbing each other, and even experienced politicians such as Giolitti thought they could use fascists to further their own goals. Of course, this backfired spectacularly...\n\nNow, however, we have learnt the harsh lesson with forty years of dictatorship, and we won't make the same mistake twice! It is the burden of good men and women to always stand vigilant against those who would take away their freedom and their loved ones. Therefore, all Italians who truly believe in democracy should unite under our government, to safely transition towards true democratic rule, and forever banish the taint of fascism so that it never comes back to haunt our existences as it did before."
