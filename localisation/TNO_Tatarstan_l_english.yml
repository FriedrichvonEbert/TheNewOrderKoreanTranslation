 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SABIR_AKHTYAMOV_DESC: "Sabir Akhtyamovich Akhtyamov may have been a Soviet citizen, but he is always a Tatar first, and he holds his homeland above all else. The son of a blacksmith, he was briefly drafted into the Red Amy, but the breakdown of the chain of command meant that he was never deployed to the front. When the Union collapsed, he simply stayed at home. The Tatar Autonomous SSR may have escaped the worst of the war, but thousands of its men were still sent off to never return. More importantly, they got their first taste of real freedom since the abortive Idel-Ural State of 1920. And once they had it, they were not eager to give it up. When the West Russian Revolutionary Front demanded suzerainty, the Tatars only accepted in exchange for significant autonomy and exemption from Russian laws. They had a tense, but peaceful, co-existence with the Front until the West Russian War, when the Russians tried to extend the Red Army draft to the Tatars. The thought of having to spill Tatar blood in a Russian war once again was too much for many to bear, Akhtyamov included.\n\nThe Tatar people took up arms, fighting for the freedom they were long denied. Akhtyamov made his name as a war hero in the time, renowned for both his battlefield prowess and his logistical skills behind the front lines. When the Russians gave way and retreated further north, people heaped laurels upon Akhtyamov and proposed he be elected mayor of Ufa. Being the highest-ranked civilian official, he was effectively the first President of Tatarstan, and it was his signature that ratified the Tatar constitution. He has helped earn his native land's freedom, and he will fight bitterly to defend it."

 POLITICS_ABDULA_ALIS_DESC: "Abdulla Aliş may have been a Soviet citizen, but he is always a Tatar first, and he holds his homeland above all else. A son of peasant, Aliş became known as one of the foremost Tatar writers and journalists. In the years of World War II, he served in the Red Army and narrowly escaped the German capture near the city of Bryansk. When the Union collapsed, he simply stayed at home. The Tatar Autonomous SSR may have escaped the worst of the war, but thousands of its men were still sent off to never return. More importantly, they got their first taste of real freedom since the abortive Idel-Ural State of 1920. And once they had it, they were not eager to give it up. When the West Russian Revolutionary Front demanded suzerainty, the Tatars only accepted in exchange for significant autonomy and exemption from Russian laws. They had a tense, but peaceful, co-existence with the Front until the West Russian War, when the Russians tried to extend the Red Army draft to the Tatars. The thought of having to spill Tatar blood in a Russian war once again was too much for many to bear, Aliş included.\n\nThe Tatar people took up arms, fighting for the freedom they were long denied. Aliş made his name as a national poet and a war hero in the time, renowned for both his battlefield and rhetorical prowess. When the Soviet army under General Pyotr Gavrilov gave way and retreated further north, people heaped laurels upon Aliş and proposed he be elected mayor of Kazan. Being the highest-ranked civilian official, he was effectively the first President of Tatarstan, and it was his signature that ratified the Tatar constitution. He has helped earn his native land's freedom, and he will fight bitterly to defend it."

 POLITICS_IBRAGIM_MINGAZEYEV_DESC: "The story of the Tatar Republic is in many ways similar to that of the other nations in the Idel-Ural: oppression under the resurgent West Russian state, until the chaos that Onega's victory brought allowed a national revival. Ibragim Zafirullovich Mingazeyev got to witness it for himself, as an aspiring writer recruited into the Red Army only for it to disintegrate.\n\nTwice the Tatars were brought under the Russians' fold again: once until Aliş set the Republic free, and once again until the Anti-Communist Guard arrived. Mingazeyev, already a member of a circle dedicated to Tatar rights and autonomy, was chosen to be the leader of a new democracy.\n\nNow, his only wish is for the nation to thrive and for him to continue the legacy of Aliş and all who came before him."

 TAR_free_tatars: "Free Tatars"
 TAR_free_tatars_desc: "Once the rulers of the steppes, the Tatars have since seen better days. For centuries, we have been ground down under the Tsarist boot, bled by the Russian overlords to fight in their wars time and time again; up to this day. We, however; we cry out: enough. No longer will Tatar blood be spilled for any Russian warlord's ambition! We will preserve our newly-gained freedom by any means necessary."
