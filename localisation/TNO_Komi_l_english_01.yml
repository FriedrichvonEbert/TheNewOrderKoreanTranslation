 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VOZNESENSKY_DESC:0 "Originally only a middle-level Soviet statesman, Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky found himself as the only guarantor of democracy, flawed as he is, in a small piece of the former Soviet Union. Being remarkable among his peers for extraordinary talents in the economic science and administrative work, Voznesensky was chosen by the Red Army Stavka on the eve of the West Russian War to oversee the recovery mission in the Komi ASSR. For his service to the Soviet province, Voznesensky acquired a considerable popularity among the people of Komi, who saw him as the benevolent statesman wishing to put the benefit of a common man ahead of the bickering and intrigues between the power-hungry Soviet cliques.\n\nAs the result of endless power plays between the Front and the hardline Communist bureaucrats in Syktyvkar, the now-president of the Komi ASSR Voznesensky remained as the sole figurehead in the Republic who could boast about the public support. Disillusioned with the Orthodox Marxist dogma and remaining bitter about the incompetence and pettiness of the Soviet higher-ups that nearly brought Komi to destruction, he reshaped the political system of the Republic into a representative democracy, where the voice of every man or woman can be heard and will be heard, breaking away with the single-party dictatorship.\n\nAlthough the hard efforts of Voznesensky brought daily bread and a sense of confidence for average Komi citizens, the reputation of Syktyvkar brought many unsavory people to the city who seek nothing but eliminate the democracy of Komi through her own institutions. But challenges to Voznesensky come not only from the extremists, but also from his fellow democratic politicians, who question the capability of Voznesenky to maintain the republican values, citing his abrasive and inappropriate behavior for a man of his position and his embarrassing ties to various Socialist groups. However, despite the political pressure, Voznesensky is not a person who wants to abandon the system he envisioned without a fight."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DESC:0 "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina was one of the children of Josif Stalin, a Georgian member of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and one of Nikolai Bukharin's fiercest rivals. Although her father vanished from the historical record during the Great Patriotic War, Svetlana was able to safely survive the chaotic evacuation of Moscow and came to find refuge in Sykvytkar, capital of the fledgling Komi Republic. While her father was infamous in Party circles for being a hardliner and socialist ideologue, his parenting seems to have driven Svetlana in the opposite direction, and she quickly associated herself with Komi's rapidly growing political center. They welcomed her as a stabilizing force in a chaotic political system, and she quickly became a figurehead for the fragile center to rally around.\n\nNow that the political situation in Komi has deteriorated, Stalina has stepped up and decided to take the reins of state herself. Although she has resorted to some rather authoritarian methods to maintain order, she insists that they are temporary measures in the name of stability, and that she will soon fully restore democracy to Komi. Some are skeptical of her claims, but her actions still trend toward the center, and she is a far more pleasing candidate for many than the alternatives."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DEM_DESC:0 "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina has been praised by her supporters as one of the few voices of stability or sanity in western Russia, and by her enemies as an authoritarian in denial, an opportunist who would take any chance she could to destroy the perceived radicalism she so hates.\n\nWhatever the case, Stalina's success as a politician is as unmatched as her story tragic. Her father, Iosif Stalin, was a Soviet bureaucrat and early supporter of Bukharin, who had died in an industrial accident rumored to be orchestrated on the orders of the Soviet government. In the long period following the death of Stalin, she has lost more and more - her mother, in the Great Patriotic War, her husband, purged by the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and her eldest brother, killed by friendly fire during the collapse of the Front at the end of the West Russian War.\n\nIndeed, Stalina claims that the war is where she first tasted the bite of radicalism, and when she vowed to oppose it at all costs. Stalina's party, the Sovereign Democratic Party, or PSD, gained prominence in the Komi Republic as a big tent comprised of big tents, a place for all who valued a safe and stable Russia over all else. Though Stalina's policies often borrow from left-wing populist principles, it would be most unwise to mistake her for a Marxist, as her father was. The basis for her political stances exists in the principles of "sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism" - the construction of a strong, independent Russia through an assertive foreign policy, heavy support for public welfare, and a strong, modern military.\n\nThrough the democratic process she fought so long to protect, the people have given Stalina their mandate, and the Lady of Steel stands prepared to defend her beloved Motherland from all enemies that may assail it - even if that danger is the unchecked will of the people itself."

 POLITICS_ANDREY_ZHDANOV_DESC:0 "Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov - a name surrounded by either love or suspicion, depending on how much one actually knows about the man. Zhdanov is one of Komi's key politicians, a proud socialist leader with experience from chairing the Leningrad Communist Party before the Great Patriotic War, Zhdanov ended up entangled with the government of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, serving as an influential figure in an attempt to encourage Russian cultural unity against the Germans.\n\nHowever, the Front fell, and with it, Zhdanov's beloved universal cultural program. When the government fled to Syktyvkar and promptly dissolved, Zhdanov stayed behind, forming ties with Mikhail Suslov in the series of coups and power struggles that preceded the formation of the Republic. Despite his more authoritarian socialist stances in the early days of the Republic, Zhdanov has recently taken to pushing for more libertarian initiatives - democratization of a Komi socialist state, encouraging growth of minority culture, and reconciliation with the center-left. Additional initiatives he has supported include a greater synthesis of universal culture, science, and ideology into a general doctrine of Zhdanovshchina, increasing prioritization towards research into scientific management within the Communist Party, and creating standards for 'revolutionary art'.\n\nStill, paranoia seems to follow him, as persistent rumors push the idea that his true nature is not truly changed, but rather lying deep below the surface, waiting for him to acquire true power."

 POLITICS_ALEXEI_KOSIGIN_DESC:0 "An economic mastermind, Alexey Nikolayevich Kosygin is one of the many people to have made himself part of the chaotic politics in Komi. Starting as the director of a textile mill, he was a supporter of the Bolshevik cause but only began to climb the hierarchy of the party and its nation-wide bureaucracy a few years before the war. By the time the Great Patriotic War had begun, Kosygin had been noted by the Soviet leadership as a trustworthy Party member and an overall clever individual. During the small time window between the beginning of the German invasion and the complete collapse of the motherland, he played a key role in evacuating industry to the east. His whereabouts following the dissolution of Bukharin's government remained unknown, until years later, when he emerged in the newly formed Komi Republic. There, Kosygin distinguished himself as a brilliant economist, and a vocal proponent of the Center coalition that held the country together.\n\nSoon, he would found the Union of Young Reformers, a party of his own which still allied with President Voznesensky, but clearly followed a separate agenda. Eventually, while the coalition he belonged in held out against radicals, the Young Reformers were able to usurp power from the dominant coalition leader, and now Kosygin has become the new President. Unlike Voznesensky and his absurdly close relation with certain factions of the Left, he has been clear on this issue: there will be no negotiation and no alliances with radicals on either side of the political spectrum, no matter what. The democrats must stand on their own, and create an economic power that can challenge other contenders for the reunification of Russia - Kosygin always being the designer of these ingenious plans for reform. How far these reforms will go remains to be seen."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SUSLOV_DESC:0 "Despite his humble origins, having been born in a rural community near the Volga, Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov has made a name for himself in his homeland. Starting from the Communist Youth, Suslov quickly became a prominent member of the Bolsheviks in Rostov and even managed to entangle himself in the local administration of the Party.\n\nWhen the Germans attacked, Suslov was designated to orchestrate guerrillas in the Caucasus. With the arrival of Wehrmacht forces, he was nowhere to be seen. There were rumours that he continued fighting in the woods, or that he was hanged by the garrison, but these rumours were soon proved false for the people of Arkhangelsk, as the man appeared in the city so far away from his home. Soon, just like when he was young, he entered the political stage of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Climbing up the hierarchy, he became one of the most prominent WRRF politicians, and soon, was granted the prestigious position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the passage of time, Suslov was becoming even more influential and it was believed he could be the next Premier. Then, the West Russian War happened.\n\nAs the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed, Suslov found himself in the city of Syktyvkar, along with economic planner Nikolai Voznesensky. Together, they carefully created the Komi Republic, but soon this uneasy pact would end as each side had a different vision for the country. Suslov quickly used his position as leader of the red paramilitaries to gain power and influence, and managed to make himself an integral part of the Republic in political and military affairs, which meant removing him from the equation would not be easy. Having remained a puppet master for a long time, Suslov has finally come out to assume leadership as the Komi Republic has become a socialist state, allowing him to carry out his plan for governing the country."

 POLITICS_BORIS_PONOMARYOV_DESC:0 "Boris Nikolayevich Ponomaryov has long been the face of the Komi Republic's Socialists, yet he is not its true leader. A relatively unremarkable historian and party functionary in the final years of Bukharin's Soviet Union, by sheer luck, he was able to flee the German invasion. With the collapse of the united Front in West Russia, Ponomaryov had to once again abandon his comfort, and headed to the newly established Komi Republic, a safe haven for political radicals and revolutionaries like him.\n\nIn Syktyvkar, he was able to come in contact with many supporters of the Revolution, those who wanted a return to the ways of old, before the glorious Union fell. As far away as that dream seemed, it still gained the support of Ponomaryov, who was quickly entangled in the webs of the left wing of the Republic. One man who was particularly keen on including him in his machinations was Mikhail Suslov, the "Puppetmaster". By propelling him to prominence in the party, and securing him a position in the National Assembly as well as some degree of power, Suslov could ensure Ponomaryov's loyalty, who was satisfied with what he had.\n\nNow, the socialists have finally made their move, and one of their loyal members has been expectedly assigned the position of General Secretary. As nothing more but a puppet of the men pulling the strings, Ponomaryov lacks real influence, and remains merely a strong figurehead for the government and population, as well as a way for his allies to remain in the shadows. However, he is absolutely content with that."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DESC:0 "The story of Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky is as anomalous as his personality and political views. Born to a Russian merchant and Jewish seamstress, Taboritsky was nevertheless a staunch Russian monarchist and earnest anti-Semite from an early age, trying to get rid of the "Cain's seal" inherited from his mother. Becoming an exile in the Weimar Republic following the Russian Civil War, he acquitanced himself with Russian reactionary circles, reinforcing his beliefs and helping to spread the infamous 'Protocols of Zion' in Germany. Along with his long-time friend Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, he assassinated a former Russian Kadet politician Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov in attempt to bring revenge upon those whom he considered the main instigators of the revolution that ruined the Russian Tsardom. As the NSDAP came to power in Germany, he became one of the most enthusiastic collaborators with the Nazi regime among the White émigrés, hoping that the German dominance would pave a road for the restoration of monarchy in Russia.\n\nLike others, Taboritsky joined Vladimir in Vyatka, but soon he became displeased with who he claimed was the 'impostor Tsar', sincerely believing that the true Emperor of Russia, Tsarevich Alexey, miraculously survived and will arrive to his subjects should they prove their loyalty to their rightful ruler. Few in Vyatka could share his eccentric beliefs, but soon he found his following in Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nA person too unhinged for his enemies and friends alike, Taboritsky, however, succeeded to outplay them all and emerge as the sole ruler of the city, claiming the title of the Imperial Regent for Tsar Alexey II for himself. Few expect Taboritsky's delusions to come true, but few doubt his rule will be anything but ferocious one, as his zeal is fueled by long-standing hatred for Bolsheviks and anyone who betrayed the Russian Tsar in his darkest hour."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_BURGSYS_DESC:0 "The mask has finally slipped, and the clock now ticks ever forward. Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky, formerly the dark horse of the Passionariyy Organization, has finally secured utter control of the state, and his plans for its future could not be any more disturbing - at least to his many detractors.\n\nOnce again harnessing the talent for oratory that ensured the relevance of his Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire even when, by all accounts, it should have been entirely subsumed by the larger Organization, he has now announced that very restoration. Claiming to rule as regent for the Tsar Alexei II, who he states escaped execution by the Bolsheviks long ago, he routinely issues thunderous appeals to those to value traditionalism and Imperial nostalgia, and couples these appeals with open and extremely virulent anti-Semitism.\n\nTo those supporters, relatively numerous as they may be, it is as if God himself descended, in the form of Taboritsky, from Heaven in order to save the Empire. To everybody else, he is an abject madman, as unstable as he is dangerous, and as opposition coalesces, both within the state and within his own mind, the question is clear:\n\nHow long until the clock strikes midnight?"

 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DEAD_DESC:0 ""

 POLITICS_BURGSYS_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "§RRemain calm.\n\nThe Regent endures.\n\nAlexei lives.\n\nThe Holy Russian Empire shall endure.\n\nThere is much to be done.§!"

 POLITICS_LEV_GUMILEV_DESC:0 "Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov, the only child of famous poets Anna Akhmatova and Nikolay Gumiylov, spent most of his youth being persecuted by the Soviet power for his unreliable ancestry and unorthodox scholarly views. In the years of his exile and wandering across Russia, he thoroughly studied history and ethnography, introducing the concept of passionarity, which postulates that the rise and fall of every historical ethnos is driven by the Passionariyy, the few people who change their environment and society to their vision, driving the history of their people forward. Instead of reducing his discovery to a merely academic matter, he saw that the salvation of Russia lies in the practical application of his theory and fancied himself as the one who will bring the passionarity of the Russian super-ethnos to its maximum heat. Being rejected and ignored by Russian warlords, Gumilyov found his supporters in Komi, among those Russians who felt betrayed and disenfranchised by the Bolsheviks and democrats alike.\n\nGumilyov's deep erudition, amiable personality and impeccable charisma attracted almost every shade of the right-wing in Ust-Sysolsk under his banner, making him the patriarch of the Russian nationalism overnight. The Passionariyy initially were considered an underdog of the Komi politics, however, as Gumilyov proved himself not just as an ardent Russian patriot and charming, if slightly eccentric, ideologue, but also as a ruthless manipulator who does not shun any means to achieve his goals, the right-wing extremism became a force that prevailed over every other political group in Komi.\n\nThough Gumilyov emerged as an indisputable master of Ust-Sysolsk, his ultimate agenda remains unknown to anyone due to his chameleonic and sometimes even opportunistic nature. Whether if he wishes to appeal to the whims of his nationalistic supporters or he decides to pursue his own dream of the Eurasian civilizational empire, the whole Russia stands in waiting of his Scythian advance to bring the dying Western world down."

 POLITICS_SVETLANA_BUKHARINA_DESC:0 "Svetlana Nikolayevna Bukharina was brought up at the very top of Soviet society, being the daughter of General Secretary Nikolai Bukharin. She spent her youth in the Union's best academies, attending galas and cultural exhibitions with the Party's uppermost echelons, and carefully observing her father's debates and political maneuvers. When the Union disintegrated and Bukharin vanished, so did Svetlana. Rumors flew that she had escaped with her father and gone into hiding, gotten "disappeared" by a political rival, or even hiding in a secret bunker complex beneath Moscow. Those rumors were quashed when she eventually resurfaced in Syktyvkar, capital of the (relatively) democratic post-Soviet Komi Republic. But her idle years had not dulled her political edge.\n\nMany in Komi's socialist movement saw that having her as a figurehead would be a massive propaganda coup, and quickly worked to gain her willing support. But they did not anticipate that she would have ambitions of her own. Through careful manipulation and backroom deals, Svetlana was able to build up a powerful support base, and ended up launching an internal coup against the ideologues who once tried to control her. Now that she sits at the top of Komi's political ladder, people wonder - or fear - what her next move will be. Few believe that her vaulting ambition has run out, and many suspect she may soon turn her eye toward the rest of her father's former domain..."

 POLITICS_IVAN_SEROV_DESC:0 "Ivan Alexandrovich Serov is a man to which the term 'former' has often - and correctly - been applied. Former chief of the NKVD in Bukharin's Soviet Union. Former friend and political ally of Mikhail Suslov. Former supporter of orthodox Marxism-Leninism. And, now, former political contender. For having established firm control over the state as a whole, he is now in a position to determine its future.\n\nThat future is his own vision of the political philosophy of so-called 'Ordosocialism' - an eclectic mixture of far-left socialism and far-right nationalism, and one where Russian exceptionalism, in many fields and areas, is strongly emphasized. Although considered an inherent oxymoron by many, Serov is firmly committed, as least ostensibly, to ensuring its representation within the policies of the state.\n\nThough none can say with certainty what the positions he intends to take will be, it can be reasonably expected that, under the tenets of Ordosocialism, they will include the formation of a strong authoritarian state, a dramatic increase in military expenditures, a rise in revanchist propaganda, and aggressive approaches to territorial expansion."

 POLITICS_IGOR_SHAFAREVICH_DESC:0 "Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich is many things to many people. Fascist. Democrat. Reformist. Radical. Anti-semite. Patriot. But if there's one thing that people do not call him, it is unintelligent. Shafarevich, born to a moderately successful family living in Moscow, was from a young age gifted at mathematics. A remarkable genius for his age, he was enrolled in a university level math course, even entering his final undergraduate year at Moscow University without having finished the 9th grade. His future never seemed brighter, until the German arrived.\n\nForced to flee Moscow, he was evacuated to the east, in Komi, never to see Moscow again. As Russia was consumed in warlordism, Shafarevich became involved in politics in Komi, a rump state carved up after the failure that was the West Russian War. There, he rose up the ranks of the right wing Passionariyy organization, leading the party's moderate faction, much to the chagrin of Gumilyov and his faction.\n\nDeveloping a right wing ideology known as 'Passionate Conservatism', Shafarevich has made himself popular among more reformist rightists in the party, those favoring working within the democratic system. Despite this, he has been accused of fascism, anti-semitism, as his hatred of the 'small nation' (a group of 'anti-national elites' whose values are completely at odds with Russia) echoes that of the hatred of Jews and other minority groups. Now, as leader of Komi, he will fully implement his vision of a better, more stable, order."

 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_KATUSHEV_DESC:0 "Known throughout the Republic as the 'Iron Governor,' Konstantin Fyodorovich Katushev was, originally, an engineer and industrialist in Gorky, working to administer one of the vast factory complexes there under the purview of General Averin and his brigade of armored raiders.\n\nWith their collapse, and the re-integration of the now-renamed Nizhny Novgorod into the Republic, he quickly entered politics, winning the endorsement of the Young Reformers and election as the region's Governor. A phenomenally skilled organizer, administrator, and perhaps most importantly, orator, Katushev quickly grew to dominate his party, centralizing operations in Nizhny Novgorod and shaping its policies along staunchly liberal lines. He was elected party leader in short order, and soon after stood for President.\n\nOnce again demonstrating his talent as a politician, he led the Reformers to victory, and was elected as President. Now so empowered, he intends absolutely to put his lberal policies into practice, shifting the Reformers - and the country - away from their and its socialist roots, and towards a liberal future he considers far superior."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_YAKOVLEV_DESC:0 "Alexander Nikolayevich Yakovlev's career is one marked by remarkable change and evolution. Born to a peasant family in Korolyova, Yakolev's father was a Red Cavalryman during the Civil War and an important leader in the local agricultural commune. Raised in such an environment, at a young age he became an ideological adherent to Marxist-Leninism. Under normal circumstances, he might have even become an important local politician, and maybe even beyond. But the German invasion changed all that.\n\nConscripted in the Red Army, Yakovlev saw how easily Marxist-Leninism fell to the hoards of German soldiers, crushed beneath the tire treads of Panzers, then, after it was all done, shattered into a thousand bickering generals and warlords. Such destruction forced Yakovlev to view socialism through a different, more independent lens - a view that placed human dignity above ideological purity.\n\nOriginally a member of Zhukov's clique in the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he has adapted well to the Russian Republic, organizing the Arkhangelsk Oblast into a DSNP stronghold. A firm member of his party's left flank, he has made himself famous as an orator of populist values. Now, as President and successor to Voznesensky, he intends to take both the party and the Republic in a different direction, and to ensure, once and for all, that all citizens are happy and free."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_KARDASHEV_DESC:0 "One of the youngest senior figures within the Ultravisionary faction, Nikolai Semyonovich Kardashev is also perhaps one of the most prominent, inextricably linked with the movement through his development of one of its foundations - the eponymous Kardashev scale.\n\nA method of evaluating the level of technological advancement of a society he, along with everyone else within the faction, ensures that every policy acts to increase it. This, together with his natural administrative abilities and affable personality, allowed him to rapidly advance towards the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nA physicist by education and trade, Kardashev takes his goal of scientific advancement very seriously. Despite this, however, he is not a member of the so-called 'orthodox' wing of the faction, and indeed disagrees with many of their projects and pursuits. Dismissing the many pseudo-scientific pursuits of others towards a nebulous 'superculture,' he instead concentrates upon economic affairs.\n\nThis expresses itself in his tireless advocacy and pursuit of developments supporting what he considers to be true ultravisionary socialism - a fusion economy where science serves the people and permits the creation of a post-scarcity society. Though many scoff at this dream, Kardashev knows it is achievable.\n\nAnd he intends to make sure that it is so realized."

 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_CHELOMEI_DESC:0 "A longtime member of the Ultravisionary faction, Vladimir Nikolayevich Chelomei became a household name within the movement through his tireless participation - and enormous success - within the Federation's space program.\n\nTrading on this recognition, as well as his ability to muster support amongst a broad range of influential figures within the Federation, he has been able to rapidly advance his standing, ascending to fill the office of Paramount Leader.\n\nOne of the most prominent members of what could be considered the 'orthodox' wing of the Ultravisionary movement, Chelomei unsurprisingly holds true to many of the core tenets laid down by Zhdanov and other central figures. This includes strong support for initiatives relating to space exploration as well as the ideological concept of the ultravisionary superculture.\n\nIndeed, he believes this to such an extent that he holds it as a simple fact that space is the natural 'next frontier' of the terrestrial Cold War. Securing victory in space, therefore, means securing victory on Earth, and vice versa.\n\nAnd he intends to do everything possible to ensure that the Federation achieves that victory."

 POLITICS_ANDREI_ZHDANOV_ULTRAVIS_DESC:0 "An Ultravisionary future is within grasp, and Andrei Zhdanov has no intention of allowing it to slip through his, or the state's, fingers.\n\nHaving occupied senior positions in Bukharin's old Soviet Union, the Komi Republic's old Assembly and now, of course, in the position of highest authority within the Federation, Zhdanov is well-accustomed to power, which he has used to advance not only his own cause, but also the cause of the Ultravisionary movement in general.\n\nHe carried it to victory through the chaos of the late Republic. He presented it with a clear path forward. With well-defined objectives that he had meticulously crafted and patiently explained to lesser men. And he had thought his confederates to have supported his view entirely.\n\nBut such was not the case. The rot had set in. Compromise and deviancy had corrupted the agenda, diverting resources and attention from critical projects, scientific and otherwise. The very destiny of the Federation itself was at stake, and as a true visionary, Zhdanov could not remain idle.\n\nRoundly denouncing and taking decisive action against the libertarians and other holders of unorthodox interpretations of the Ultravisionary agenda, Zhdanov has now reasserted his authority over the movement. Now firmly in absolute control, he can turn both his attention and the resources of the state, finally and once again, outwards.\n\nTo the stars - and beyond."

 NIK_the_minutes_of_the_congress_desc:0 "1년이 더 흘렀습니다. 그리고 우리 연합의 의회는 우리 공화국을 가능한 한 잘 운영했습니다. 우리의... 불행한 상황에도 말이죠. 하지만, 균열이 보이기 시작했고, 공화국 내부의 파벌주의는 심지어 우리의 연합내에서도 놀라운 속도로 성장하고 있습니다.\n\n우리가 코미를 계속 관리하고, 급진주의자들이 집권하는 것을 막으려면 적들을 진압하기 위해 신속하고 결단력 있게 행동해야 합니다."
 NIK_the_last_years_of_the_voznesentsi_desc:0 "우리의 집권 연합은 니콜라이 보즈네센스키 휘하의 '보즈네센치'라는 가장 좌파적인 민주파가 이끌고 있습니다. 그들의 지도 아래, 코미는 폭탄으로부터 재건하고, 사망자 수를 낮추고, 우리의 마을과 도시로 난민들을 끌어들이는 등, 상당한 향상을 보았습니다. 하지만, 모든 것이 잘 되어가지는 않습니다. 보즈네센스키의 극좌파, 특히 안드레이 즈다노프와의 유대는 상당한 경각심을 불러일으키고 있으며, 보다 보수적인 연정 내 구성원들 사이에서 끊임없는 불편의 원인이 되고 있습니다.\n\n보즈네센치가 당의 우두머리 자리를 지킬 수 있을지, 아니면 다른 파가 그들의 자리를 대신할지는 시간만이 말해 줄 것입니다."
 NIK_speak_with_stalina_desc:0 "스베틀라나 스탈리나는 유명한 소비에트 관료인 이오시프 스탈린의 딸로, 급진주의를 억제하는 효과적인 수단을 고안하는 데 있어서 우리의 가장 귀중한 자산 중 하나입니다. 그녀의 계획은 종종 무자비하고 효율성을 우선시하지만, 일반적으로 훌륭하고, 우리의 경쟁자들의 끊임없는 모략에 좋은 영향을 끼친 것으로 증명되었습니다.\n\n그녀의 충성심을 유지하고, 그녀의 영향력을 더 많이 발휘할 수 있도록 우리 당을 개방하는 것은 많은 사람들에게 우리의 패권을 유지하는 데 있어 중요한 부분으로 여겨지고 있습니다. 그녀의 권위주의적 주장에 대해 보다 원칙적인 몇몇 민주주의자들의 불평에도 불구하고, 그녀에게 접근하는 것은 분명 우리에게 도움이 될 뿐일 것입니다."
 NIK_our_paramilitaries_reports_desc:0 "우리의 준군사조직 지휘관인 페트로 그리고렌코로부터 곧장 거리의 눈들에 대한 최근의 관찰 결과가 나왔습니다. 이전의 보고서들은 우리에게 코미 공화국의 그 어느 때보다 중요한 길과 도로를 통제할 수 있는가하는 우리의 능력에 대해 그다지 확신을 주지 못했고, 이 보고서도 다르지 않습니다.\n\n점점 더, 수슬로프와 구밀료프의 통제하에 있는 준군사조직들은 거리를 행진하며 창고, 투표소, 그리고 심지어 식팁카르의 일부 구역까지 장악하고 있습니다. 반면, 우리의 부대는 민주 연합 지역들에 대한 통제와 우리가 가진 것을 방어하는 능력에서 흔들리며 오그라들고 있습니다. 코미의 시민들이 우리의 민주주의를 훼손하는 급진주의자들을 보고는 눈을 돌릴 수 없게 되기 전에 우리는 지금 이 문제에 대해 뭔가 조치를 취해야 합니다."
 NIK_the_government_in_check_desc:0 "우리 정부의 그 어떤 것도 어떤 식으로든 위험을 면하지 못했습니다. 우리가 발만 동동 구르고 있는동안, 좌우파 모두 우리로부터 아무런 반격 없이 음모를 꾸몄고, 계획적으로, 그들은 움직였습니다.\n\n우리는 기본적으로 두 마리의 떼까마귀를 옆에 두고 있는 왕입니다. 우리가 할 수 있는 행동은 몇 가지뿐이고, 실수를 하지 않도록 올바른 행동을 취해야 합니다. 코미의 민주주의의 불씨를 살려두려는 계획은 서둘러 지켜지고 바뀌어야 합니다. 공화국의 운명은 거기에 달려 있습니다."
 NIK_eyes_to_the_left_desc:0 "구밀료프는 코미 정치의 복잡한 게임속에서 작은 해충이지만, 훨씬 더 큰 위협에 대처해야 하는데, 바로 그림자속의 수슬로프와 그의 추종자들이 이끄는 급진좌파들입니다. 거리가 그의 준군사조직들에 의해 점점 더 많이 점령되고, 그리고 그의 투표 수가 점차적으로 증가함에 따라, 대처해야 할 비상사태는 정치적 스펙트럼의 이쪽에 있습니다.\n\n이에 맞서기 위해 우리가 민주주의의 수슬로프가 되어야 합니다. 공산당의 어떤 하수인도 우리 정부의 감시로부터 벗어날 수 없을 것이며, 머지않아 극좌파의 음모 지도자들은 그들을 무너뜨리려는 우리의 계획과 싸워야 할 것입니다."
 NIK_observe_leftist_paramilitaries_desc:0 "우리 나라에서는 거리를 행진하는 준군사조직들의 모습이 서로에게 인사하는 방식이 될 수도 있습니다. 준군사조직은 우리를 포함한 모든 당의 생명선이고 보이지 않는 손입니다. 그리고 약간의 분별력을 가진 모든 음모자들은 그것을 알고 있습니다.\n\n우리 공화국에서 준군사조직의 지위와 중요성 때문에, 그 깡패들이 무엇을 하고 말하는지 보는 것만으로도 우리는 그들의 계획에 관한 귀중한 정보에 접근할 수 있게 될 것입니다. 우리의 요원들과 시민 감시를 통해 우리는 언제 어디에 적이 있는지 시시각각 알아낼 수 있습니다."
 NIK_the_spreading_red_influence_desc:0 "평범한 레스토랑에서의 대화에서부터 투표소까지, 회의와 구역들에서 빨간색과 금색의 낫과 망치들이 그늘을 차지하기 시작했습니다. 그들을 긍정적인 시각으로 말하기 시작하는 사람들은 더 이상 극좌파들뿐만 아니라 점차 평범한 시민들입니다.\n\n공산주의적, 사회주의적 선전의 보급은 우리의 준군사조직들을 통해 중단되어야 하며, 시민들을 위한 우리의 정보가 그것을 대신할 것입니다. 투표소는 더욱 경비가 강화될 것이며, 의심스러운 시민들은 좌익 활동을 점검받게 될 것입니다. 우리는 여기서 그들의 노력을 멈출 것입니다."
 NIK_the_strike_from_the_right_desc:0 "비록 좌파적 위협을 물리치는 데 도움을 줬다고 해도 우파의 상황은 우리에게 유리하게 전개되지 않은 것 같습니다.\n\n우리가 공산주의의 위협에 대처해 올 동안, 파시스트들은 이 기회를 이용하여 그들의 영향력과 범위를 넓힌 것으로 보입니다. 좌파와 마찬가지로 새로운 그래피티, 유권자 협박, 구밀료프로부터 준군사조직의 공격 등에 대한 소식이 우리 정치권에 퍼졌고, 금방 멈출 기미를 보이지 않고 있습니다. 회의를 소집하고, 이 새로운 위협에 대처하기 위한 계획을 수립하여 실행해야 합니다."
 NIK_a_new_face_question_desc:0 "보아하니 좌파를 갈라놓으려는 우리의 노력 덕분에 그들 당의 분열이 심화되었습니다. 이것은 우리에게 좋은 반면, 매우 큰 문제가 생겼습니다. 우리는 정확히 누가 공산주의자들로부터 분리되고 있는지 모릅니다.\n\n그 사람은 이미 당내에서 많은 영향력을 얻었습니다. 그 정도는 이미 알려져 있습니다. 보고에 따르면, 그 사람도 한때는 수슬로프의 부관이였지만, 자신의 의지로 결별했다고 합니다. 그리고 이 사람이 누구든 간에 지금 좌익에 많은 권력을 행사하고있습니다. 이 새로운 지도자에 대한 것은 이 세가지 정보로부터 파생된 것이며, 그게 전부입니다. 우리는 코미의 정치적 게임에서 이 새로운 경쟁자가 누구인지 재빨리 알아내야만 합니다. 이 새로운 좌파세력이 공격해오기 전에 말이죠."
 NIK_eyes_straight_ahead_desc:0 "한쪽을 '더 큰 악'으로 분류하는 것이 구미가 당기는 것처럼 보일 수도 있지만, 우리의 신념은 양쪽이 모두 민주주의에 위험한 세력이며, 한쪽을 상대하는 것은 다른 한쪽을 강화시킬 뿐이라는 것입니다.\n\n진정한 해결책은 다른 이들을 공격하는 것이 아니라 우리 자신을 방어하는 것입니다. 민주주의는 효과를 낼 수 있고, 실현될 것입니다. 필요한 것은 우리에게 고통을 주는 문제들을 해결하려는 우리 정부의 의지이며, 급진주의의 침략에 저항하려는 국민들의 의지입니다. 이 두 가지를 자극하는 것은 우리의 생존에 큰 도움이 될 것이며, 공화국이 국민을 위해 계속 존재할 수 있도록 해줄 것입니다."
 NIK_distance_from_zhdanov_desc:0 "우리 정부의 불안요소는 우리의 지도자 보즈네센스키 동지와 그의 관계를 둘러싼 소문에 관한 것입니다. 전하는 바에 의하면, 보즈네센스키는 극좌파 안드레이 즈다노프와 유대관계를 맺고 있으며, 심지어 개인적 차원에서도 우정이 있다고 합니다.\n\n비록 우리는 이 소문들이 우리를 분열시키려는 수슬로프파의 음모라고 믿지만, 그들은 여전히 깊은 우려를 하고 있고, 물론, 소문은 아무것도 없는데서 오는게 아닙니다. 만약을 위해서, 보즈네센스키 동지에게 즈다노프와의 관계를 끊고, 일반적으로 그의 정당과 행동으로부터 거리를 두라고 간청하는 것이 최선입니다."
 NIK_reinforce_the_center_desc:0 ""동지 여러분, 공화국의 희망이 급진주의자들의 악한 거짓말에 있지 않다는 것을 기억하십시요. 그러한 거짓은 우리의 통치에 자신이 없는 사람들을 유혹하고, 그들을 함정에 빠뜨리고, 급진주의자들의 목적을 위해 우리 시민들을 세뇌시키기 위한 것입니다! 이러한 거짓말에 대한 해결책은 버텨내는 것입니다. 더 이상 시민들은 수슬로프나 구밀료프에게 넘어가지 않을 것입니다!"\n\n스탈리나의 의원들을 대상으로한 연설은 급진주의자들과 싸우기 위한 우리의 계획의 개요입니다. 중도파는 반드시 사수되어야하고, 그러기 위해서는 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 노력을 다해서 그것을 보존하고 다른 사람들이 극좌파나 극우파의 손에 넘어가는 것을 막아야 합니다."
 NIK_the_face_of_the_movement_desc:0 "스베틀라나 스탈리나. 자산, 웅변가, 전사.\n\n스탈리나는 최근 공화국의 불씨를 유지하는 데 있어 더욱 중요해졌고, 코미의 시민들에게 빠르게 홍보와 명성을 드높였습니다. 열렬한 반혁명주의자였던 그녀의 연설과 행동은 식팁카르와 그 너머의 적들의 위협에 정면으로 맞서는 것으로, 많은 사람들을 우리의 민주주의 이념으로 이끌어 갑니다. 이제, 우리는 그 어느 때보다도 급진주의자들을 몰아내기 위해 그녀가 필요할 것입니다."
 NIK_let_them_burn_themselves_out_desc:0 "내 적의 적은 내 친구이다, 이런 말이 전해집니다. 물론, 말하자면 그들은 실제로 우리의 친구는 아니지만, 우리 공화국을 굳건히 하는 데 매우 유용한 도구입니다.\n\n좌파와 우파는 민주주의를 증오합니다. 이것은 사실이지만, 그들에게는 그보다 더 나쁜 것이 있습니다. 그들은 서로를 항상 싸워야 할 치명적인 적임을 선언하고 있습니다. 지금도, 그들의 준군사조직들은 거리에서 싸우며, 식팁카르와 공화국 전역에서 이념적 패권을 얻으려고 합니다. 물론 이 전투에서 '승리한' 쪽의 수가 줄면... 그들은 우리와 싸우려고도 하지 않을 것입니다."
 NIK_eyes_to_the_right_desc:0 "우리 공화국 전역에 그림자가 드리워져 있습니다. 그 어둠들은 식팁카르의 수면 아래 숨어 기다리며 시간을 벌며 공격할 음모를 꾸미고있습니다.\n\n이 그림자들은 다름아닌 코미의 우익 준군사조직 지도자인 레프 구밀료프와 일부 정치인들의 것입니다. 좌파와는 협상할 수 있지만 구밀료프의 음모는 우리가 몰락할 때까지 멈추지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 눈과 귀로 듣는 것에서부터 시작하여 우파에 집중해서 그들을 몰락시켜야 합니다."
 NIK_armed_activities_desc:0 "코미의 우익 준군사조직들은 그들의 의도와 무장에 있어서 거의 자제력을 보이지 않는 것으로 잘 알려져 있습니다. 그들은 거리 곳곳을 누비며 파이프와 단검, 심지어 권총과 소총까지 들고 행진하며 그들에 대항해 목소리를 내거나 맞설 사람을 위협합니다.\n\n하지만, 구밀료프의 광기에는 방법이 있습니다. 패턴을 추적하고, 위치를 기록하고, 행동을 문서화함으로써, 구밀료프가 우리가 알기를 원하지 않을 수도 있는 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다. 우리에게 더 좋은 정보입니다."
 NIK_the_extent_of_the_shadow_desc:0 "구밀료프는 우리 정부 사이에서 극우파의 총수가 되기로 합의된 반면, 우리는 다른 것에 대해서는 별로 합의할 수 없었습니다. 구밀료프의 특기는 그의 연줄과 유대를 왜곡하고 숨기는 것인데, 이것은 때때로 그의 영향력이 우리 공화국과 그 기관 내에서 얼마나 큰지를 판단하는 것을 거의 불가능하게 만들기도 합니다. 구밀료프를 물리치려면 구밀료프가 숨어 있는 곳을 먼저 밝혀내야 합니다. 우리의 관찰과 연구를 통해, 마침내 우파의 꼭두각시 조종자의 요원들을 밝혀낼 것입니다."
 NIK_the_strike_from_the_left_desc:0 "골목길 벽에 붉은 별을 거칠게 뿌렸습니다. 붉은색과 금색 깃발이 공중에서 휘날리며, 잠시 동안이지만 동네 집들에 걸려 있었습니다. 언덕에는 눈이 있고, 벽에는 귀가 있으며, 신체 부위는 모두 수슬로프에서 왔습니다.\n\n구밀료프와 우파에 대항한 우리의 캠페인이 시작된 이후, 코미의 거리 곳곳에서 공산주의 활동이 급증하고 있습니다. 기회를 잡아서 우리의 맹점들을 공격하면서, 그들은 영원히 그들을 끝장내버리기위해 우파에 대항하는 그들만의 캠페인을 시작했습니다. 이것이 표면적으로는 우리에게 좋은 일이지만, 구밀료프가 영원히 사라지면 좌파는 새로운 목표를 갖게 될 것입니다. 바로 우리입니다. 우리는 강력하고 영향력 있는 붉은 군대에게 허를 찔리기 전에 이 시나리오에 대한 준비와 계획을 세워야 합니다."
 NIK_believe_in_svetlana_desc:0 "아마도 구밀료프를 분쇄할 수 있는 유일한 정치인 중 한 사람인 스베틀라나 스탈리나는 급진주의자들과의 싸움에서 우리의 가장 중요한 자산 중 하나입니다. 그녀의 연설은 우리 정치인들에게 영감을 줄 뿐만 아니라, 우리의 지지자들에게 동기를 부여하여, 그들이 조국을 위해 기꺼이 싸우도록 만듭니다.\n\n스베틀라나는 앞으로 나아가는 길이며, 우리가 우파(와 좌파)를 분쇄하고 코미에 질서를 가져오려면 그녀는 민주주의의 횃불과 국민의 의지의 불꽃을 짊어져야 합니다. 그 횃불은 우리가 그녀를 전적으로 신뢰하는 것입니다. 그녀의 예를 따르고 공화국을 영원히 안정시키는 것은 우리에게 달려 있습니다."
 NIK_the_interlude_desc:0 "잠시 동안이지만 마침내 상황이 다시 진정된 것 같습니다. 음모를 꾸미는 자들은 대중의 눈을 피해 후퇴했습니다. 어둠 속에서 계속 음모를 꾸밀 수 있도록 말이죠. 거리는 평온해졌고, 입법 회기는 점점 덜 혼란스러워지고 있습니다.\n\n하지만, 이런 고요함에는 이유가 있습니다. 곧, 민주주의는 코미 공화국 전역의 선거에서 다시 한번 시험받게 될 것입니다. 그들의 지도자가 지금 권력을 잡기를 원하는 모든 파벌들은 대중의 지지와 지역에 대한 준군사조직의 통제를 계산하면서 계획을 세우고 통합하고있습니다. 운동의 시간이 끝났습니다. 전략 수립의 시간이 시작되었습니다."

 NIK_the_1963_assembly_desc:0 "때가 왔습니다. Every five years, a new President is elected, and every two years, a new National Assembly. This election is no different than every other election: a high-stakes contest where each candidate for the head of the house campaigns to control the Republic, and everything valuable within.\n\nAs per tradition, it is now time to choose our candidate for figurehead of the democratic coalition. Each of the three candidates - Voznesensky, Kosygin, and Stalina - will express their positions and why, exactly, they deserve to be the leader of the democrats - and the people. After, we will select a Presidential candidate, who, hopefully, will be the best choice for our nation."
 NIK_election_day_preparations_desc:0 "An election is not something that can be organized on the spot, even if the radicals believe otherwise. We must now begin the process of readying the poll booths, sending out fliers, organizing locations, and more of the standard procedure that bores our legislators to no end.\n\nAs usual, we will call up ready volunteers to do their duty to democracy, and do these tasks for us. And in all of this, of course, we must also be aware of the radicals, for their idea of 'preparations' is something much more sinister..."
 NIK_ensure_internal_stability_desc:0 "In recent days, it has been reported that our party is a "mess" in certain areas, such as the fact that debates over sometimes trivial things can run hot and wild between our Deputies, as well as growing factionalism and refusal of cooperation between party members. While, normally, this has been allowed under the perpetrator's defense of "freedom of opinion and expression", the upcoming election is one of the most critical in our history, and the democratic party cannot permit these problems any longer.\n\nThrough distinct methods, we will ensure that everyone sits down and shuts up - united as one party. No longer shall the chamber erupt into argument every other speech, and no longer shall we tolerate the cracks between our wings. We will be as one, together - we must be, for the radicals shall come as one as well."
 NIK_calculate_the_bombing_intervals_desc:0 "Each and every week brings hellish armageddon down upon our lands, as the Nazi bastards rain down their bombs upon the people of Russia. New orphans are created every day, and hospitals always fill to the brim for days after - especially Tuesdays, for that's when they all come.\n\nThe Germans are as predictable as they are evil. It is no coincidence that the bombs always rain down at specific times and more on certain days than others, that their Wehrmacht seeks to enjoy the coffee breaks at their designated hours and days and not any other. They will not stop our "little" democracy. All it takes is a little calculation, and any interruption of the election will no longer come from the air."
 NIK_protect_the_people_desc:0 "A person should always feel safe in their own home - whether from the inside or out. While they do not dare touch our cities, bandits and thugs have been known to roam the countryside, seeking to rob and maim to their heart's content. In addition, the German bombings have been a constant source of casualties, blasting apart anyone that is unfortunate enough to be near their dastardly weapons.\n\nPeople cannot vote if they are busy with other things, such as surviving. Therefore, we must embark on a program to cleanse the bandits from our countryside, guard our borders from any foreign incursions, and defend ourselves from the air raids. Only then shall democracy flourish."
 NIK_watch_the_radicals_desc:0 "The radicals have never believed in the democratic process, even if they say otherwise. While they have been rather quiet in the days leading up to the election, it is always possible they may come out of the shadows at any time. The chessmasters on either side still have aces up their sleeves, and there is no telling exactly what they have in store.\n\nObservation of the paramilitaries are necessary, and any left-wing or right-wing activity will be snuffed out and found. If they have any "funny tricks"they wish to play, we will know - and we will fight back."
 NIK_something_wicked_this_way_comes_desc:0 "Months of rigorous preparation. Days of campaigning. Enjoy it or dread it, participate in it or flee from it - the election comes all the same.\n\nNow comes the trial of democracy, and the ruling with it. Each and every preparation that we have done for this event will now either pay off or let us down. This critical election decides our fate, and the future. Some doubt our chances, and others wish us dead, but no matter what happens - democracy will always prevail in the end."

 NIK_the_affairs_of_the_legislature_desc:0 "As much as our detractors enjoy condemning our Republic for its excess of political intrigue and the occasional bout of violence, there is more to Komi than scheming and intriguing. The policies of the National Assembly, while bitterly contested, as all things are, are a critical element for the thousands of people who are affected by the government's machinations each year. Opening the National Assembly for the year, appointing new party whips, and ensuring that everything functions as normal shall ensure that the functions of the Republic's institutions are as strong as ever.\n\nAdditionally, this will give us the opportunity to cut through precedent and tradition, changing long-standing laws and improving life for the multitudes of citizens of the Republic. Through the tactful exercise of state power, backed by the people, anything becomes possible."
 NIK_bill_the_1962_budget_desc:0 "The 1962 budget of the Republic is a critical document providing a comprehensive list of appropriations for each and every program administered by the government of Komi. However, even with the ruling coalition's dominance of the National Assembly, its passage is not entirely guaranteed. Historically, compromise has been necessary to pass budgets, as every party within the coalition has different ideas on what should be funded.\n\nThe budget, thusly, has become an exercise in pork-barrel spending, with Deputies given appropriations for pet projects to keep them loyal. With the increasing unpopularity of President Voznesensky, however, the National Assembly could, possibly, not be quelled by the usual tricks. Numerous advisors and allies to the President have hinted to him that the usual methods of getting the government on his side will be much less effective during this term, and additional means may be necessary to ensure that the Republic gets what it needs in terms of funding."
 NIK_bill_the_infrastructure_repair_bill_desc:0 "While the Republic has a department of transportation that handles repairs to infrastructure and replacements to damaged watercraft and transport vehicles, the department has constantly delivered complaints about how its funding is insufficient to deal with every issue that it currently faces. A new bill has been proposed to the National Assembly to pass through a special appropriation for the department of transportation, which is to be dedicated specifically to providing aid to their infrastructure repair division.\n\nHowever, certain aspects of the bill are undecided, specifically, labor laws and the exact source for the funds which are to be dedicated. These matters must be decided on in the National Assembly before the bill is to pass."
 NIK_bill_the_mandated_minority_representation_bill_desc:0 "There lies a deeply concerning trend throughout our Republic of inequality in the National Assembly. The majority of the Deputies are Russian, with an extreme minority of the National Assembly made up of the peoples that the Republic bears the name of - the Komi. The proposed bill, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina's PSD, makes a stand for a certain quota of minority representation, with new districts drawn to ensure more minorities are sent to the National Assembly, and the rich cultures of the Komi can be protected from a lack of representation.\n\nUnusually, Stalina and the Left have aligned on this matter, with a large contingent of the Voznesentsi, the PSD, and the Communists supporting this measure. The fate of the bill seems to rest on the groups that can be rallied to support or oppose it - a more moderate bill could gain the support of more of the center, who are concerned about the political ramifications of mandated representation, and marginalize the Left."
 NIK_bill_the_defense_of_the_republic_bill_desc:0 "The Komi Republican Army is a formidable force in the Russian wastes, but has its own set of problems - namely, its small size. Due to our small population and necessarily inefficient census system, the Army doesn't get quite as much manpower as it needs from our current conscription policies. Several solutions have been raised in the National Assembly to address this issue and defend the Republic from hostile neighbors.\n\nWhile the official line of the ruling coalition is to increase the conscription period from one to two years, the Left has proposed an addendum - a loosening of the laws that ban certain people from volunteering for military service, due to participation in certain political organizations. While this is a drastic measure, it could assist the Republic in getting the manpower it needs. The solution, as always, will be decided in the National Assembly."
 NIK_bill_the_equal_zoning_bill_desc:0 "Redistricting is a concern that has long affected many elements within our Republic, from the disenfranchised refugees on the peripheries of our cities, to the politicians attempting to organize their re-elections. The process is infamously arduous within Komi and Syktyvkar specifically, thanks to the bombings and high volume of population transfers thanks to refugees and our lack of resources to run accurate censuses.\n\nThis, naturally, has lead to an environment in which more or less any sort of population distribution can be constructed and made to look official, without cooking the books too much. Behind the curtain, the President has spoken to several Deputies on the redistricting board - giving a favor to certain politicians to make them unassailable in their districts could be just the 'incentive' they need to throw more of their support behind the government's initiatives."
 NIK_bill_the_municipal_pacification_bill_desc:0 "The paramilitary situation has been said to be getting completely uncontrollable, with a general uptick in overall violence over time. Several politicians in the National Assembly, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina and Alexei Kosygin, leaders of the democratic centre, have proposed a rather drastic bill, one that has been said to increase police powers within 'problem areas' of the Republic to levels not seen since the days of Bukharin. While many politicians in the National Assembly have railed against the bill, calling it a tyrannical government overreach, and a naked attempt at shutting down political opposition to the current ruling parties, one can also argue that this opposition is just an attempt to prevent these politicians' illicit sources of assistance from being persecuted. Whether they like it or not, the bill will come up to vote, and it will all come down to the democratic process."

 NIK_countercoup_democrats_coup_desc:0 "When the Republic was founded, it was the goal of the governing parties to keep violence out of Komi's political system. Though noble, this goal was a terrible failure in practice, to the point that the defenders of democracy have had to use the same weapon as its enemies: a military coup.\n\nNow that Komi's democracy has been saved from the brink of death, it is the military's responsibility to safeguard it, lest it be lost again and irreversibly. We must be ever vigilant; never again can extremism be allowed to threaten our liberties. Only after we have weathered the storm can the Republic return to a situation approaching normal."
 NIK_countercoup_defend_democracy_desc:0 "It was nearly lost, but the people of Komi have retaken their democracy from the clutches of an extremist putsch. The Republic is restored, but this may all be for naught if the same forces who nearly destroyed it rebuild their efforts. It is for this reason that we must remain vigilant, and extend our wariness of authoritarianism to the public.\n\nThe people, turned skeptical by recent turbulence, must be reminded to love democracy. Media campaigns against extremism of both the right and the left and a hunt for the anti-democratic forces in our midst are a must if we want to fully restore confidence in the liberal system." NIK_countercoup_expel_the_radicals_desc:0 "While the political leadership stakes out its course, most of the day-to-day runnings of the republic is handled by the bureaucracy, the police and the army.

We can't afford to keep anything in reserve. For the good of the republic!"
 NIK_countercoup_emergency_rule_desc:0 "The greatest triumph of our republic has been to end arbitrary "frontier justice" and give its people a dependable, predictable justice system to protect their rights and freedoms. Unfortunately, the radicals still have sympathizers in our society, sympathizers who will abuse these freedoms to obstruct our efforts to restabilize the republic. We are forced to suspend, for the time being, some of our most cherished rights. The radicals have given us no other option."
 NIK_countercoup_restore_order_desc:0 "The Republican Army failed in its duty when it allowed our Republic to fall to radical forces. While loyal officers have been vital in striking back, our forces are still scattered and demoralized. This state of affairs can't be allowed to continue. Our enemies are rallying their forces, and the struggle for our home is far from over. We need our army back.\n\nWe must rally our soldiers. We must remind them of their duty. The army will restore its honor by crushing the nascent insurgency."
 NIK_countercoup_our_loyal_sympathizers_desc:0 "A large majority of our citizens support the republic and believe in its founding principles. Recent events have shown, however, that this majority is prone to inaction in the face of attacks by internal, radical forces. We must restore their confidence and teach them principles and tactics of resistance and mass action, so that they will resist attempts to subvert their rights and freedoms and do their part to defend the republic in the future."
 NIK_countercoup_paralyze_the_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Several political movements have organized their membership into paramilitaries. Previously tolerated to maintain stability, it is now abundantly clear the practice needs to end. The coup-makers leaned heavily on their armed support, but even the notionally loyal groupings proved unreliable, acting more as agents of chaos than allies. We will issue a demand for all such groupings to stand down and demobilize permanently. Paramilitaries which refuse will be subject to arrests and forced disarmament. Peace in the republic requires it."
 NIK_countercoup_restore_the_quiet_desc:0 "The recent instability and fighting in the republic has wreaked havoc on the economy and the day-to-day rhythm of civilian life. While we are now in the process of restoring control, this has not yet been felt by the populace. That needs to change. We will keep the streets safe for the people. We will reopen schools, markets and shops. They will see that life is returning to normal, and hopefully, it will restore their faith in our leadership."
 NIK_countercoup_komi_belongs_to_the_citizens_desc:0 "The recent instability has been a dark time in our short history. Our rights and freedoms came under attack, and the Republic itself came very close to falling. Insurgents were in the streets, visiting their thuggery on an undefended people. We were at the precipice of something truly dark.\n\nThrough immense effort, we have made it back. All over the republic, brave men and women have fought for the rights and freedoms we all hold dear. We have fought, and we have overcome. The enemy has been defeated, and moderate forces are now firmly back in control. We have won."

 NIK_unstable_victory_a_victory_for_democracy_desc:0 "After counting every vote, it turns out that the democrats have received a plurality of the vote!\n\nEven more surprising to Komi's citizens, it seems that the moderates have decided to go at it alone. Without a clear majority of the delegates, the resulting government is destined to be an extremely weak one. Yet the parties of the center left to center right have decided to gamble that neither the far left nor the far right will dare to cause a vote of no-confidence so soon after elections. Perhaps the far left and far right militias will give the government at least a month to live?"
 NIK_unstable_victory_secure_the_republic_desc:0 "Barring some unfortunate extralegal violence by paramilitaries, the biggest threat to the new coalition government is a simple vote of no-confidence by fascist or communist deputies. The new government's first order of business is thus to spend every scrap of influence and diplomacy to gather enough confidence and supply agreements to stay afloat for the year. By guaranteeing that the government will not fall while trying to pass a budget, the moderate coalition hopes to gain some time."
 NIK_unstable_victory_a_standing_coalition_desc:0 "Even with the vaguest assurances that the government is free from outside pressure, internal pressure within the coalition also need to be kept in check. When living life on the thinnest of political edges, a single deputy defecting could have disastrous consequences on the government. And so, a generous amount of ministries and positions have to be doled to every coalition partner, with the biggest political party keeping a few choice offices for themselves."
 NIK_unstable_victory_the_defense_plan_desc:0 "The democratic coalition would not trust the fascist and communist with a bucket of warm piss, let alone believe their empty platitudes about respecting the minority government for at least a year. As such, extra precautions are being taken to make sure every single member of the government is free from extreme ideology. Equally important is being absolutely certain that no one in the coalition can be blackmailed, lest the ensuing consequences be disastrous."
 NIK_unstable_victory_stalinas_speech_desc:0 "Among the moderate coalition's few blessing is the backing of Svetlana Stalina. The charismatic woman is popular both within the democratic factions and without, throughout Komi's electorate. By having her go on a public offensive against the communist and fascists, some very needed breathing room could be created for the democratic faction. Stalina is already well known for disliking the ideologues and fanatics that impede Komi's progress. Yet, some within the government worry about rumors of the young woman's ambition. Many worry that her honeyed words might in the end poison the young republic. In the short term, however, the coalition must play all of its cards."
 NIK_unstable_victory_direct_action_desc:0 "Left unsaid in the communist and fascists' pledges not to overthrow the government democratically is the danger posed by their paramilitaries. What's a little coup, between friends?\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, a small cabal of coalition officials have begun to cook up some extra-legal defense of the republic. The communist and fascist fear one another more than they fear the weak minority government. Their surprise at seeing the benchwarmers lash out might be just what the coalition needs to survive."
 NIK_unstable_victory_acquire_the_information_desc:0 "As the fascist and communist plot each other's destruction, the coalition government's secret security committee has begun to ramp up its intelligence work. Suslov and Gumilyov are slippery eels, yet many of their subordinates fail to live up to their bosses secrecy. By bribing small time agents of both sides, a sizable pot of information can be built up on both factions. Speed is of the essence, as is a simultaneous strike at both sides."
 NIK_unstable_victory_surround_the_neighborhoods_desc:0 "To a casual observer, it might seem that Komi's republican army is completely compromised; its officer corp riddled with Suslov plants, and many of its best regiments crewed by mercenaries of suspect loyalties. Yet legally speaking, the army's chain of command leads to the civilian government at all times.\n\nNow that the government has intel, army units have been arranged in crucial neighborhoods around the city. By moving rapidly, it's likely that neither side will have the time to use their army contacts before it's too late."
 NIK_unstable_victory_nip_it_in_the_bud_desc:0 "The tell tale sounds of guns and artillery slamming around various points in Komi has kept most of the city's inhabitants hiding indoors. Occasionally, some daredevil wanders out to look for information.\n\nThe shocked communists and fascists have been woken in the middle of the night by army troops. Both sets of paramilitaries are putting up a violent fight, their cause aided by turncoats within the army. No one knows if the government's gambit is likely to succeed or fail."
 NIK_unstable_victory_komi_is_strong_and_stable_desc:0 "Throngs of suspected fascist or communist sympathizers are being marched to various secure prisons around the city. Shock and dismay cloud the eyes of the defeated paramilitaries, woken in the middle of the night by the toothless coalition government and its soldiers.\n\nThe minority government has somehow succeeded in its mission to crush the far right and far left! Some might worry that the city's democracy will forever be stained by the violent crackdown. These men and women simply fail to see that for the first time since its foundation, Komi's republic is now strong and stable! No longer shall violence intimidate politicians of the nation!"

 NIK_demexpansion_the_republic_saved_desc:0 "Rejoice, citizen, for the republic has been saved!\n\nIt has taken our government everything to prevent our young nation's fall into extremism. But now that the dust has begun settling, our political system has been repaired and we stand united to face against the wider world. Soldiers and leaders that had once only been concerned with surviving just another week are now free to turn toward the rest of Russia. With the end of the Anarchy, many factions will no doubt attempt to impose their control on the lands of the former Soviet Union. Our Republic must stand ready to expand outward in order to crush extremists and find new allies for our fledgling nation.\n\nWe have crushed the fascist and communists in Komi, and this experience shall serve us well!"
 NIK_demexpansion_assemble_the_armories_desc:0 "With the end of political violence, many armories and weapon caches that were under the control of extremists elements are now open to access. It will take some time to count everything, but already the available rifles and support equipment can be pressed into service to help equip the Republican Army further.\n\nSecuring as many weapons as possible will also help us douse the embers of political extremism. The days of private militias holding onto weapon stockpiles are finally coming to an end. From now on, the government shall decide who has access to military hardware, and that's that."
 NIK_demexpansion_infrastructure_programs_desc:0 "Now that a map of Syktyvkar no longer resemble a chess board of districts held by a protean mass of paramilitaries of varying allegiance, we are free to roll out unified infrastructure plans. Places where the government has not dared send officials in ages can finally be assessed, improved and perhaps even taxed.\n\nThe least controversial move will first be to improve the infrastructure in and around Syktyvkar. Crumbling roads and buildings do not inspire much hope that the government is looking after the common man. Nor are they much help to an economy attempting to climb out of years of stagnation."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_army_of_the_republic_desc:0 "Komi has always had, on paper at least, a strong army. Since its inception the republic has remained free from foreign encroachment by the quantity of soldiers in the field.\n\nThis has not always been evident to the man in Syktyvkar's streets. Riddled with corruption and factionalism, with entire units either underpaid or overpaid to ensure political reliability, the army of the republic has always been perceived as a right mess. A significant fraction of its total strength is composed of militias and men outside the regular command structure, fighting only in dire emergencies. Now that the Republic desires to expand outward, a more regular state of affairs is needed. Two proposals have been thought up on the army reforms, and it's important to decide rapidly on which one the republic prefers."
 NIK_demexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc:0 "The first faction proposes scrapping every militia and integrating their men into the regular army. This will be a daunting undertaking, stretching our current army structure to the breaking point. Countless militiamen will have to be screened for political extremism, and those that don't make the cut will no doubt be angry at losing their job and weapons.\n\nCompleting the reform will take time and effort. But as the WRRF has demonstrated in the fifties, a regular army can achieve miracles when properly organized. The republic must end the militias if it is to be safe internally and externally."
 NIK_demexpansion_elevate_gifted_officers_desc:0 "Dozens of smart and dedicated men have joined our army from their former militias. In Komi's hyper competitive period of political instability, one did not rise to the top without a good head on their shoulder.\n\nThe integration of these men has done much to soothe the concern of former militiamen about more purges and arrests of the militias. It has also brought us a treasure of institutional experience. Veterans that have fought in the West Russian War, or helped defend Komi as auxiliary militias are now pouring into our army and helping redefine its doctrines for the better."
 NIK_demexpansion_keep_the_militia_structure_desc:0 "The other approach to reforming our army is to preserve the militia structure. Having armed men outside of the army is a concern for many reasons: some worry about disloyalty from the militias, others point to the dangers of a non-standardized fighting force, or of amateur soldiers breaking at the first sign of danger.\n\nTo others, the militias are a perfectly valid part of Komi's arsenal. They provide large amount of volunteers to defend the rear of the Republican Army; they provide an easy way to train up new soldiers that might one day join the regular army; they show that our reformed government bears no ill will toward its past enemies as all of Komi turns toward the future. Preserving the militias can thus be an essential part of the republic's security policy."
 NIK_demexpansion_popular_mobilization_desc:0 "Our decision to preserve the militia has made us a lot of friends. Militia commanders of all stripes have decided to repay our trust with a call to mass mobilization. Areas of the city long held by the militias with inhabitants that disdained the republic's officials are now beginning to offer their help. A tide of new recruits to the militias and army has begun cropping up. All that is now needed is to train and equip the brave patriots willing to fight for their country!"
 NIK_demexpansion_mission_to_vologda_desc:0 "To the west, general Ivanov maintains a careful position of armed neutrality in Vologda. In the aftermath of the Front's collapse, the good general decided that spilling the blood of Russian civilians for ideological squabbles was simply not worth it. Vologda has kept up cordial, if bemused relations with Komi's unstable republic. The western junta has long appreciated Komi's policy of welcoming all, while disliking the resulting political violence.\n\nWith a newly minted democratic government standing proud, it might be time to revisit the relationship. Komi and Vologda both face external threats from the Front and from southern regimes. A diplomatic mission has thus been sent to Vologda to offer a treaty of peace and friendship between both nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_an_alliance_for_peace_desc:0 "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, our President is scheduled to meet with Vologda's representatives to sign a treaty of peace and friendship. Soldiers and citizens of both side cheered the news that their leadership plans to sign one of the first peaceful reunification of the Russian nation.\n\nMuch remain to be done, beyond this ceremony. The depth of the military alliance, as well as its implication on economical and political matters remain to be seen. But throughout both nations, there is nigh universal agreement that mutual friendship and assistance is the best way forward."
 NIK_demexpansion_establish_economic_ties_desc:0 "As Vologda and Komi get closer, their respectives economy continue rising from the decade of bombing and warlordism. Trade links that had already been significant during the Anarchy are being strengthened by the day. In this light, it is essential for official trade policies to be established between the two allies.\n\nStrategic industries from both side will be integrated, helping both Komi and Vologda to increase their military readiness. Joint investment schemes have also been discussed to help lift up the civilian economy of both nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_freedom_of_movement_desc:0 "The frontier between warlords in Russia is often more of a theoretical concept, consisting of a long range of military checkpoints and demilitarized zones plagued by bandits or lawlessness. While in theory there had been no law prohibiting movement between Vologda and Komi, in practice doing so required several levels of military approvals for private citizens. Traders have long been used to carrying their stack of documents at military checkpoints.\n\nA new treaty is in the work, providing legal rights to Vologda and Komi's citizens to cross the border unimpeded. This will no doubt help friendship and partnership blossom among our nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_mutual_defense_desc:0 "While Vologda might not be totally ready to join any of our future wars of liberation, their generals have agreed to strong mutual defense treaties. In the event of an attack on one side, the other is expected to declare war on the invaders. This defensive alliance will free up much needed resources for Komi's Republican army. Contingency plans for defensive wars will no longer use the hypothesis that the Komi-Vologda frontier requires constant military defense. Likewise, the Vologdan army will be free to tend to its own business, confident in the safety of its eastern flank."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_republic_alone_desc:0 "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, the republic's reformed army will be deployed in a pre-planned military exercise. The Vologdan high command has been dutifully noted of this; rumors on the street in both capital is that while cordial relations will continue, Komi's government has little interest in demilitarizing the border between both nations after receiving Vologda's refusal of an alliance.\n\nWhile disappointed, analysts inside of Komi's government are not too shaken about Vologda's refusal. It is likely that the Vologdan generals would have refused to help Komi in its offensive wars of liberation in Western Russia. In the end, the republic would have always had to fight alone for the freedom and safety of all Russians."
 NIK_demexpansion_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "The unfortunate refusal by Vologda of friendship means that the republic, as always, is surrounded by enemies on all sides. Military planners have thus begun preparing supply and communication lines in the event of any invasion by hostile powers. Plans that had been drafted in the event of Vologdan friendship are scrapped, replaced by scenarios where a hostile western army attacks the republic while it is busy elsewhere.\n\nThe republic stands vigilant, and sleeps with one eye open."
 NIK_demexpansion_expand_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "Going at it alone will require ever more troops in the army. A new call for expanded emergency conscription is being prepared. Our government will explain to every citizen the reason for our renewed conscription policy, and the importance of manning every frontier of the republic. New recruits will be able to free up experienced men for frontier duty, and eventually these veterans will lead the spearhead of our reclamation wars."
 NIK_demexpansion_watch_and_wait_desc:0 "Our frontiers have never been better defended. As troops settle into their new assignments, officers on the border have been given secret tasks. The best and brightest men of each formation are to run reconnaissance patrols in the demilitarized border zones between us and our rivals. The men are to probe enemy fortifications, observe enemy patrol frequency and destinations, and do their best to assess weak points in enemy lines. This information will be crucial once we go on the offensive."
 NIK_demexpansion_between_three_foes_desc:0 ""Citizens! My friends, our republic is in grave danger. To the north lie the remnants of the Soviet Union, haunted by its failures and angry at our independence. Even as we speak, the northern Red Army plots our undoing!\n\nTo the south and east, things are not any better. Deluded tsarist remnants wish to turn back the clock and reimpose the shackles of autocracy on our free citizens. In this project they resemble our eastern neighbors. In Gayny, a theocracy blames Russia's woes not on the evil of German fascism, but on the anger of an unforgiving God. These madmen believe that only by subjugating Russia to the church's whim will the people be saved.\n\nThe republic rejects this madness! It is not a cabal of communist or tsarist military officer that can free Russia. Nor can its salvation come from subservience to crazed monks. The only power strong enough to free Russia is its citizens. We must be on our guards!"\n Extract from President [NIK.GetLeader]'s speech to the republic."
 NIK_demexpansion_defense_stratagems_desc:0 "The work that began during the early reforms of the Republican Army is now complete. The army's commanders have presented to the civilian authorities several military plans as well as new doctrinal recommendations. The doctrinal ideas will help us modernize our army and train a new generation of soldiers and officers. The military plans provide a wide range of military campaigns against neighboring threats to the republic's safety.\n\nIt is likely that the civilian leadership will bring a few recommendations of its own. Nevertheless, both generals and politicians are confident in the republic's capacity to destroy its closest foes."
 NIK_demexpansion_against_the_communists_desc:0 "To the north, the Western Russian Revolutionary Front. The largest remnant of the Soviet government, the Front fought valiantly in the fifties and almost managed to break the Wehrmacht's spine. When the tide turned, Syktyvkar was to be the Front's fallback capital. Their evacuation pushed further north by the Luftwaffe, the remnants of the Red Army have spent a decade licking their wounds and plotting a comeback.\n\nThe communist's intention against Komi are crystal clear. Arkhangelsk sees us as as nothing more than illegitimate separatist rebels. Our recent suppression of the far left has not improved our reputation with them. Already the Red Army plants its invasion of the south. If our republic is to survive, we must prepare to take the war to them. This will be a titanic struggle, for most of the professional soldiers and industry in western Russia are in the Front's hands. We must prepare!"
 NIK_demexpansion_fortress_syktyvkar_desc:0 "Syktyvkar is our greatest city, and one of our greatest assets. We cannot afford to lose its population and industries to the communists, or anyone else.\n\nThe Vychegda river's bank have been chosen as the ultimate defensive position, with forward positions on the far side of the river to delay any attack from the north east. Each crossing has been turned into a miniature, self sufficient fortress. The city's districts themselves are also being fortified, with many civilians having a sentiment of deja-vu as their hometown is once more prepared for violent conflict. Each military command and government office in the city has been given several fall back positions, to ensure continuity of government in the events that parts of the city are overrun. In the suburbs, industrial positions have been fortified, with factory workers and nearby inhabitants trained as emergency firefighters.\n\nSyktyvkar shall be one great fortress, a bulwark against tyranny no matter its source!"
 NIK_demexpansion_establish_the_vychegda_line_desc:0 "The Vychegda river snake along most of our border with the Front. Any direct assault on Syvtykar is likely to require forces on the southern shore of the river, especially if the Red Army attempts to use its tank corps to surround the city. Using the river as a first line of defense is thus a logical step in our preparations for conflict.\n\nA line of machine gun positions and barbed wire on our side of the river will inflict tremendous casualties on any attacking force. Further inland, bunkers and forts will hold mobile troops and artillery able to be redeployed to push any beachhead back into the water. The river will run red with our enemy's blood!"
 NIK_demexpansion_secondary_redoubt_preparation_desc:0 "A defensive line is only worth as much time as it buys for its defenders. Once breached, a series of fortifications can easily be surrounded, trapping its garrison. It is thus important to build reinforced fall back position further south where our men can continue to fight in the event of a breach of the Vychegda line. The Front's commanders will thus have to decide between overrunning every defensive line, or attempt to capture Syktyvkar with exposed flank. Thus, our secondary positions serve crucial roles in defensive as well as in counter-offensive plans."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_red_desc:0 "Our northern frontier is now heavily defended against any Communist violence. Any Red Army aggression will cost it dearly in terms of manpower and materiel. Once the invaders have been repelled, our commanders will be free to follow the broken formations north and attempt our own crossing of the Vychegda river.\n\nWar with the front will be far from easy. But our position is secure. The Front must either defeat us, Vologda or Gayny if they are to expand in western Russia. The communists are bound to run out of patience and make a tactical mistake in their hope of breaking out of the arctic. We've only got to wait long enough to exploit their desperation. And this combination of preparation and strategic patience forms the core of War Plan Red."
 NIK_demexpansion_against_the_monarchists_desc:0 "To the south, monarchists have recreated a miniature Russian Empire in Vyatka. Perhaps it was this later-day white army's intention to cloak itself in history. What better, after all, than a new Romanov tsar to end these modern time of troubles? This historical allusion has not provided much humor to Komi's military thinkers as the monarchist have raised a large army of rabble to this end. The monarchists do not field an army as potent as the Front. But their troops are on the march, and an invasion of Komi is inevitable.\n\nThe Republican Army's generals have thus been preparing both defensive and offensive plans against Vyatka. If the monarchists attack, our soldiers would be more than ready to repel them. If we judge it is time to end their monarchist nonsense, our men will be equally prepared to launch an invasion of the south. The white army's day are numbered."
 NIK_demexpansion_fortress_vilegodsk_desc:0 "Our border with the monarchists follow the Vyatka river. While smaller than the Vychedga river to the north, the Vyatka rivers offers a natural barrier against the whites. The largest city on the river's north bank is Slobodskoy, in south western Komi. From its origin as a small village, the area has seen a population boom as refugees have settled into the young republic and a large military garrison has been established on the southern border. Now the garrison town is being fortified. Slobodskoy will be an important staging point for an invasion of the monarchists, or for any defensive operation along the river's bank. As such, it's a primary necessity to see the city protected from all sides."
 NIK_demexpansion_staff_the_tundra_desc:0 "Winter Operations are an essential part of the toolkit of any Russian commander worth his salt. Right now our men usually winter inside garrison town, with less than a third of our men used to cold weather deployments in rough outposts. Our new deployment scheme will seek to remedy this by giving every rank of soldier training in the outdoors. Once the soldiers are used to operating in winter as in summer, they will possess the capacity to fight whatever the season."
 NIK_demexpansion_hidden_positions_desc:0 "The monarchists will no doubt attempt to cross the Vyatka river and gain a foothold in southern Komi before attempting to march onto our capital. In the events of such a breach of our southern defensive line, possessing hidden cards to play would be to the republic's advantage.\n\nWork has thus been planned for a line of secondary hidden fortification. This network of camouflaged bunker will shelter our troops if they feel the need to fall back to the interior. They will also let us strike at the flank of any army marching on Syktyvkar."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_white_desc:0 "While much of our preparation for Plan White has been defensive in nature, our commanders have still given much thought to the best way to crack the monarchist's defensive lines.\n\nThe monarchists have lost no time industrializing, and the Izhevsk arms factory to the south has equipped their conscripts with good weapons. The most obvious path to victory would be the capture of Kudymkar and its surroundings, the one stretch of the border not covered by rivers. The enemy is likely to know this, and defend the area vigorously. The alternatives are costly attempts at crossing the fortified rivers. Once in enemy territory, sieging the enemy capital of Vyatka to separate its defenders from southern industry would likely be a great tactical victory. Secondary target include Izhevsk and Krasnokamsk. Our men must be ready to pay the price for ultimate victory over the monarchist threat!"
 NIK_demexpansion_the_gayny_contingency_desc:0 "To our east, mad monks have subjugated the Gayny region. Claiming that Russia has been abandoned by the almighty for its sins and decadence, this cabal of maddened mystics has whipped up a mob of peasants into a frenzy. It is very likely that our so-called "godless republic" is next on the monk's chopping block. We must thus prepare contingency plans for a conflict with them.\n\nMilitary authorities have begun reinforcing the eastern regions while our republic's priests and politicians have made joint speeches denouncing Gayny as a mere doomsday cult.\n\nNo matter their goals, these mad monks shall not be given a chance to sabotage our efforts."
 NIK_demexpansion_preempetive_intervention_desc:0 "The president is expected to make a speech to the Republic's parliament informing them that a state of war now exists between Komi and Gayny's theocratic government.\n\nKomi's high command agrees that with the constant threat of invasion by the Front in the north and by monarchists in the south, the continued risk of a Gayny invasion cannot be tolerated. To face a two or three front war at a critical moment would certainly doom the republic.\n\nInvading the theocracy will be no cakewalk, as fanatical soldiers will follow their religious leaders into battle. The Republican Army must prevail, and rapidly, lest it gets bogged down in a war it cannot afford."
 NIK_demexpansion_extend_the_vychegda_line_desc:0 "The long Vychegda river is already at the core of preparations made against the Western Russia Revolutionary Front, or Plan Red. The waterway also snakes its way along the Komi-Gayny frontier. Fortifying it would be a cheap way to deter aggression from the angry theocracy. Were the worst to happen and the monks to attack us while we are busy elsewhere, the lengthened Vychedga line would make it easy for small deployments of border troops to repel the attackers until reinforcements are available for a counter-attack. Thus, the generals have approved additional fortification of the area."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_black_desc:0 "It is always a troubling sight for our eastern troops to see their opposite number dig trenches and prepare staging grounds across the Vychegda rivers. The monk and their warriors are no raging peasant mob, but a well organized militia that is preparing for a conventional conflict crossed with a holy crusade.\n\nBut no amount of preparation can make an under-industrialized army break a reinforced trench line, as the first world war shows. Our men in the east are ready for any eventuality. And when the time comes, their commander hold attack orders for the moment when the Republican Army marches east to restore order."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_vologda_contingency_desc:0 "No matter how our government feels about Vologda, the facts remain that our leaders are prepared for any eventuality. The Vologdan government could collapse, or turn hostile, or fall to invasion. As a result it is good to have some contingency planning for a western war. The usual invasion plans have been drawn up by our commanders, as have a set of recommendations for improved border defences.\n\nNo matter how the Vologdan government feels about us, it will understand our reasoning. In fact, it wouldn't surprise us if they did the very same thing."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_western_line_desc:0 "Particularly important to our defensive problem with Vologda is that our nation share a long border uninterrupted by rivers or wetlands. It will thus be costly but important to see a long line of bunkers, trenches, fortified positions and garrisons created. In the event of fighting in our western lands, these new fortifications, combined with existing or upcoming military outposts designed for plans Red and White will serve as a bulwark for our wester soldiers."
 NIK_demexpansion_expand_border_patrols_desc:0 "Soldiers that know a battlefield well can often win surprising victories through deception and quick thinking. The troops on the western frontier have seen their border patrol efforts expanded. Many of our men that had spent their life in Syktyvkar are discovering the countryside in and around the Vologdan border. While a few grumble at the effort, most seem happy at the opportunity to trade barracks life for extended camping trip around the wester territories."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_blue_desc:0 "Our military is now as well equipped for conflict with a "western enemy" as it can reasonably be. It is difficult to gain further military intel without offending the Vologdan government with our espionnage. Nor can we dump an infinite amount of resources into secondary threats.\n\nThe republic's leaders truly do not seek conflict in the west, and the presence of Vologda is reassuring. But in the Russian anarchy, only fools do not sleep with one eye open. As such we must add the final few touches to Plan Blue."
 NIK_demexpansion_fill_the_gaps_desc:0 "Every eventuality has been planned. Every threat has been assessed. The republic, surrounded by enemies, has turned every settlement into a castle to protect the flame of freedom and democracy. Now its citizens must become warriors to fill the gaps in our defenses, lest the enemy storm through.\n\nA final call to arm has been issued. Less fit men can serve in the interior. Farmers can join regional auxiliary militia to support the Republican Army. If our nation is to survive this darkest hour, we must stand and fight! To arms, citizens!"
 NIK_demexpansion_our_threats_vanquished_desc:0 "The republic lives! Surrounded by some of the most dangerous factions of the Russian Anarchy, Komi has managed to come out on top of the melee. The land under our control has quintupled, bringing millions of citizens into our nation. Veteran soldiers now stand guard in Arkhangelsk, Vyatka and beyond as Syktyvkar's citizens cheer uproariously in the streets.\n\nThis string of conquest will take some time to adjust to. For now, giving our citizens a breather from total mobilization will help the victory celebrations. We've got much to be proud of!"
 NIK_demexpansion_down_from_the_barricades_desc:0 "It is good to end total mobilization, for a nation that only busies itself with war robs its children of their future.\n\nWhile much of our recent conquests are still under strict martial law, the core territory of the republic is returning to some sense of normalcy. Streets that had been blocked by the military are now returning to regular circulation. Kids can be seen playing outside while their parents are celebrating the easing up of the rationing system by buying more food. Our citizen's period of rest continues."
 NIK_demexpansion_onto_the_offense_desc:0 "One who expects war would do well to mobilize first, so that they can choose the battle at their leisure.\n\nKomi's best officers have determined the best scenarios to tackle the north, the south and the east. Wherever our enemy lie, we must strike, for the republic is surrounded by enemies, and shall not see the light again without taking arms.\n\nPlan Red; Plan White; Plan Black; all three shall forever be marked in Russia's glorious rebirth!"
 NIK_demexpansion_execute_plan_red_desc:0 "The communists have long sown the seeds of conflict with our nation, and for this they shall reap the tempest. The Front has squandered its opportunity to save Russia from the fascists. In its arrogance, Arkhangelsk has not sought peaceful reunification with us, but sent instead thugs and radicals to undermine our democracy. We've expelled the communist threat from our Republic, and now the Republican Army shall eradicate the red menace from western Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_execute_plan_white_desc:0 "It is perhaps to the Tsar's credit that he has come back to Russia, rather than live a comfortable soft life in exile. But the fall of the Soviet Union has seen the rise of a new generation of Russians, men and women who do not idolize a fabled past of Russian autocracy. The Tsar and his cronies wish not for citizens, but for slaves and subjects, abject in their subservience. The Republican Army will instead show him the strength of the Russian nation, for these difficult times have forged a new generation of standard bearers for democracy and decency."
 NIK_demexpansion_execute_plan_black_desc:0 "The monks of Gayny see an angry God in the hardship that have fallen on Russia. They seek to atone for the nation's failings by uniting it in fearful repentance.\n\nWe have a different idea of Russia's plight, one manufactured by evil men and facilitated by the baseness of the human heart. If God has a side then it is definitely ours, the side of compassion and mercy, of hope and courage. To our east, theocrats speak of end times and of the displeasure of the eternal. Our soldiers will prove on the battlefield that by losing faith in the Russian people, Gayny's fanatics have committed blasphemy of the highest order."
 NIK_demexpansion_room_to_breathe_desc:0 "Our enemies all lie defeated. Their former people mill around. Some feel relief at their liberation. Others struggle to make sense of the defeat of Tsar, communism or fanaticism.\n\nOur soldiers' sacrifice has earned us room to breathe. Beyond our border lurk more dangers; ambitious tyrants dream of subjugating all of western Russia to their whims. For now, however, we have some time to consolidate. Our enemies held great amount of industrial equipment, war supplies and population. Already the republic has gone from one of the weakest factions to one of the powerhouses of western Russia. If the soldiers have been allowed some rest, our poor bureaucrats are working triple overtime to somehow integrate mountains of resources into a system not designed for population and territory of that magnitude. As their work progresses, our integration of these new assets will give us a significant edge in the upcoming wars."
 NIK_demexpansion_negotiate_with_vologda_desc:0 "It is time to revisit our relationship with our western neighbor. Our first visit to Vologda at the dawn of the unification wars was mainly concerned with military matters, for our young republic was surrounded on three sides with dangerous regimes.\n\nNow that Komi stands tall, we must ask Vologda's government about deeper integration. The men of Vologda are famous for their opposition to wars of aggression against fellow Russian citizens, and now we ask them for help in our grim unification of western Russia. No matter how they felt about us before, the fusion of our two nations is a difficult decision for Vologda's leadership. But Russia long divided must unite again. We can only hope that our neighbors understand this."
 NIK_demexpansion_merge_the_institutions_desc:0 "Today is a glorious day, for Vologda has agreed to peaceful fusion with our nation!\n\nSoldiers that used to belong to the two nations have crossed the border not in conflict, but in celebration as politicians and commanders meet to discuss how best to merge both set of institutions. Battles will be fought not between brothers, but between conflicting bureaucratic standards as torrents of inks are spilled instead of blood. Paper pushers of both nations have sparred verbally, while inwardly cheering at the peaceful nature of this conflict. And outside, people celebrate the good news of the new republic."
 NIK_demexpansion_execute_plan_blue_desc:0 "It is with heavy heart that the officers have received their orders. Plan Blue is to be activated: the invasion and occupation of Vologda.\n\nMorale is projected to be an issue, of course. Republican soldiers are not liberating citizens from despotic regimes, but putting the torch to an independent nation. Propaganda depicting Vologda as a tyrannical regime will likely ring hollow to our men... Yet, military analysts predict the campaign's success. Recruits from beyond Komi's old territory have little reason for friendship with Vologda. Amongst our veterans, dissent or requests for transfer have been few in number. Perhaps the horror of the Russian Anarchy has inured our men to senseless battles."
 NIK_demexpansion_pacify_the_territory_desc:0 "Breaking an army is for nought if the population it defended has not seen its own will broken. Vologda's population is outraged at our invasion, and armed resistance continues across much of the territory.\n\nSome carrots will be offered. Much stick will be given. Already a village has been torched after the company of former soldiers they held tried to fight off our men. The village's former citizens have had their day in court, and for their crimes, their lives were forfeit.\n\nLife as a citizen of the republic is better than death at the end of a pointless insurgency campaign. In time the former Vologdans will understand this. They must understand this. They must."
 NIK_demexpansion_unto_unity_desc:0 "Plan Red, White and Black were about sheer survival. Now, our Republic turns its eyes to the south and seeks not only to survive, but to thrive. Projecting military power to quash dangerous warlords will greatly enrich our legitimacy, prestige and resources on top of keeping us safer.\n\nOur generals' plans are not as detailed this time around, mostly based on the psychological profile of our enemies and theoretical conflicts using pre-anarchy maps of Russia. As such, much of our newly acquired resources will be used to deal with whatever warlord has lasted long enough to become one of our neighbors."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_silver_desc:0 "A strange sense of deja-vu comes to mind as our army mobilizes against Berezniki. Claiming not only to be the true communist government, but also to represent the exalted Tsar's true subjects, Kazembek's strange followers disdain our republic. They seek to mend the rift between socialists and monarchists by restoring the tsar as supreme protector of a collection of soviets.\n\nTheir ideology matters less than the army they field against us. This strange red and white army is motivated, organized in a modern fashion, and unafraid of the Republican Army. We cannot afford to let them scheme against us, lest remnants from the Front or Vyatka use them as useful idiots."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_grey_desc:0 "Everyone in Syktyvkar heard the rumors, yet the confirmation of the so-called Aryan Brotherhood's existence came to us as a shock. Many psychologists have studied the spread of mental illness caused by the hardships of the Russian Anarchy. None have come up with any logical explanation for this Russian cult of the men who brought our lands to ruin.\n\nIts grotesque ideology put aside for the moment, reports tell of us of another highly motivated army, assisted with militias of less reliable troops. This ersatz Wehrmacht wishes to impose "order" on every slavic "degenerate" they encountered. For all their endless drilling and training, this awful army of soldier cannot be allowed to survive."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_green_desc:0 "The Russian Anarchy has been a bountiful period of time for thieves and scoundrels. There is something to be said for the grandeur of Nikolai Averin's vision: an army of tanks, used for plunder and chaos. It is also admirable that the man's acolytes have mostly reserved their greed toward Moskowien to the west. The time of bandit is drawing to an end, and there is no way to make the men of Gorky see reason. Equipped with tanks and planes, our opponents believe they can dictate us terms, and deny us access to their military factories.\n\nWar with Gorky will take a different characters. Our opponents are mostly Red Army veterans, and are armored to the gills. Anti tank efforts will be crucial, as will good communications. The reward of victory will be Gorky's impressive tank factories, a prize well worth fighting for."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_violet_desc:0 "The Tatars saw the fall of the WRRF as an opportunity for independence. Rendered paranoid by the successive erosion of their rights under the tsarist and then communist governments, Tatars leaders have infected their citizens with distrust for the outside world. Negotiation with them is futile, and the only thing able to break their independence streak is the force of arms.\n\nThe Tatars are likely to fight tooth and nail our attempt to reimpose order. Our soldiers will have to carefully show the Tatar population that we fight not the Tatars themselves, but their arrogant government. Limiting civilian casualties will be extremely important."
 NIK_demexpansion_negotiate_with_tatarstan_desc:0 "It is true that the Tatars have reasons to distrust Russian interlocutors. Moscow and St-Petersburg have long ignored Tatar issues, content as they were to consign the Turkic people to the wastebasket of history.\n\nOur government is made from better stuff than the Tsar's autocratic or the Soviet dictatorship. Ethnic minorities can thrive in our young nation, and if given the chance by Tatarstan's leadership we can prove it. All we need is some trust and goodwill for the negotiations to open."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_yellow_desc:0 "Rumors came to us of a breakaway Tatar state. As it turns out, these separatists also existed an islamist fashion. The republican government might come to terms with Tatar nationalist worried about their lack of rights in a new Russian republic. The republic, however, has no place for fanatics, no matter their religion. These islamists must be crushed.\n\nA lot of the playbook of Plan Black will be reused.

 NIK_demexpansion_negotiate_with_bashkiria_desc:0 "Tatarstan's men and women had their grievances with Russian rule. Bashkiria's men and women have their own, mostly centered around religious issue. The Soviet Union's secularism sought to crush islam as thoroughly as other religions.\n\nWe are not the Soviet Union, as demonstrated by our supression of the republic's communists and our part in the destruction of the WRRF. Citizens in Komi have rights, and these rights are intrinsic to each citizen. They are not granted at the whim of a Tsar, or a political committee. Freedom of religion is an important value of our republic; surely we can reach a deal with Bashkiria?"

The republic stands triumphant once more!\n\nWhile the flood of new land to administer is not the exponential growth seen at the end of Plan Red, White and Black, integrating our new conquests into our republic has taken time. Now that our armies are taking a well earned rest, it is once again time for our public servants to wander into these new territories and catalogue everything. Industrial plants, cities, mines, population centers; all important resources for our growing nation. All this wealth is fed back into the Republican Army, covering equipment and manpower losses, and giving our men new weapons. On the horizon, new enemies. Our men must be equipped for any eventuality."
 NIK_demexpansion_ensure_industrial_preparedness_desc:0 "Building an industrial economy from the ground up using factories taken over in wars of conflict is not a precise science. Many factories that fall in our hands are geared to produce the same things as other industrial areas in our possession. Russian warlords usually function on an autarkic production system that sees everything crafted locally. Conversely, there are many goods that are produced nowhere, as the divided Russian territories did not possess an economy large enough for things beyond basic military weapons.\n\nAll this is beginning to change as we develop an integrated industrial policy prepared for a wide range of scenario and needs. Once rare items are now being produced in large quantities as the republic synergizes its various economic sectors to prevent any future penury of goods. Entire supply chains of complex outputs are reappearing in western Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_secure_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Operational integrity seeks to gather men, methods of doing and materiel into one unified whole. Mechanized tactics cannot exist without supply and logistical regiments. Once in the field, tanks and vehicles are vulnerable to aerial attacks, requiring aerial support of our own. The deployment of costly vehicles and their experienced operators relies on the assumption that neither men nor materiel are in danger of destruction. Thus any deployment also requires an intel corps.\n\nOperational integrity is thus a complex system of simple parts brought together to perform critical military tasks. Our soldiers and generals have integrated every lessons of past conflicts into a new way of doing things. Long before a tank rolls out of our new factories, its purpose is well understood by our military. Our enemy shall learn to fear this oneness of purpose and action."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_brown_desc:0 "What more is there to say concerning General Vlasov and his men? The death warrant of every single man of the ROA was signed with the blood of countless Russian soldiers killed on the order of the German Fascists. It is a mystery how Vlasov can keep talking of "Russian Liberation" when he and his acolytes have ensured that the suffering of the Russian people would last another miserable decade of steel and death.\n\nIt would not be accurate to depict the men of the ROA as spineless cowards, for they've shown courage time and time again when using their german training to take on impossible odds in the West Russian War. All we can hope is that these pigs in human form feel at least some fear at their upcoming judgement. The liberation of Samara must begin."

 NIK_demexpansion_a_centered_capital_desc:0 "Syktyvkar, the capital of our estimable Republic, has served us well, and has a storied history as the most important city we possessed, in the dark days of our origin. However, a dilemma faces the government, one that is a simple manner of infrastructure, housing, and facilities with which to administer all of West Russia. The cities of Vyatka and Samara, now that they are cleansed of Tsarist and fascist influence, respectably, have both been submitted as possible new capitals for the Republic. While Syktyvkar is well loved, the time may very well have come to move to more grandiose housing."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_west_russian_census_desc:0 "Russia is a big place, and whie we do not own anywhere near all of it, our Republic occupies a significant portion of the former Soviet Union's landmass. The teeming multitudes of people across our lands have not yet been counted or audited - in order for our democratic institutions and basic social services to have a chance of working at all, we must make a detailed census of our population. Census-takers, many accompanied by armed police, will be dispatched from regional centers in order to alleviate this issue immediately."
 NIK_demexpansion_faith_in_democracy_desc:0 "Outside of the abortive Republic under Kerensky, Russia has never known true democracy of the sort that we wish to deliver to its people. Understandably and expectedly, the people are nervous and confused - as polling booths are elected, many peasants stay home or attempt to submit blank ballots, fearful of the watchful eyes of the no-longer-existent NKVD.\n\nThis will not do - we must enact a comprehensive program of democratic education, as well as communicate to the people well and truly what our goals and principles are. Democracy must stem from the people, and it may never bloom if the people do not have faith."

For years, many within the Republic, especially those in the frozen North, have struggled under the weight of food insecurity, poor soil, and bad weather. With the fertile lands of the south once more attained, we are now free to organize a better arrangement between the peasantry and our workers, ensuring that all may prosper and be nourished by the Republic's golden wheat."
 NIK_demexpansion_meet_with_the_finns_desc:0 "A final piece of land lies out of our control in western Russia. In Onega the Finnish government has propped up an army of Russian conscript as a desperate buffer zone between them and the WRRF. While the fear of invasion by the WRRF's brand of military communism is a little understandable, the cowardly Finns have forced Russian men to fight, lest their families be in danger.\n\nThe people of Onega deserves better than servitude at the hands of the Finns. And the Finn shall receive a lesson that the Germans would do well to pay heed to: no one enslaves the people of Russia without fearing consequences down the line. We will prepare a diplomatic party. They will have only one warning."

Yet we are not out of the storm yet, for internal enemies still roam within our borders just as we march to war with external rivals.\n\nCaution is the order of the day. Anti-democratic extremists have been severely hurt by repeated losses. As we set out to destroy our regional rivals, we must also keep up the pressure on domestic threats. For this task we can thankfully bring to bear the full legal apparatus. Police officers, judges as well as lawmakers can work in coordination to stamp out poisonous elements.\n\nFinal victory at home is within our grasp. Once its rears are secured, the army of the Republic will be able to begin its march to restore democracy to all of Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_root_out_paramilitary_commanders_desc:0 "The army of the Republic has long been a pit of snakes. Political extremism within the officer corp was impossible to root out without fatally weakening the democratic government's grip on power. Left to their own devices, fascist and communist officers were free to aid anti-democratic street gangs. Some did so by propagating their doctrines to rank and files of the army; others used their tactical training to lead street gangs from the shadows; finally some served in the training of paramilitaries.\n\nWith the far right and far left waning in influence, we can finally remove from service officers and commanders who carry the taint of extremism. The loss of experienced personnel will be worth it as the central government's domestic position is reinforced and the soldiers march out with unity of purpose to face the enemy."
 NIK_demexpansion_arrest_sources_of_information_desc:0 "Many ordinary citizens cooperated with extremists, whether out of greed or ideological zealotry. Now that the judicial system is firmly under our control and that extremists in politics have been shackled, we can crack down with impunity on collaborators and fellow travellers.\n\nThe Republic must cast a wide net to arrest all those who contributed to the government's enemies. Those who broke no laws will be intimidated into taking plea-deals. Personal finances will be audited. We shall process methodically until all are guilty, or all have betrayed their former collaborators.\n\nThere shall be justice for the victims of political violence!"
 NIK_demexpansion_make_an_example_desc:0 "The Republic does not condemn its citizens to death lightly. However, there must be retribution for those who have conspired to end the nation's freedom and tolerance. Those who have infected Syktyvkar with violence must face justice. Those who have robbed their fellow citizens, those who have injured the innocents, those who have killed under the influence of extremism, all must see their sins weighed and face the risk of the greatest retribution of all.\n\nThe worst of the worst shall be executed. We do not have pity for traitors, and their deaths will hopefully inspire fear among their surviving allies. The Republic's justice is eternal. And its vengeance shall not spare the wicked."
 NIK_demexpansion_instate_weapons_regulations_desc:0 "The proliferation of weapons in the Republic has done much to let our ennemies operate without fear of retaliation. When a police action against a far-right contraband ring runs the risk of a violent gunfight against the equivalent of a platoon of soldiers with automatic rifles, hitting political criminal gangs hard becomes impossibly difficult.\n\nThe central government will introduce the first ever weapon regulation laws to the republic. The law will explicitly ban the possession of heavy weaponry. Equally under target will be automatic weapons, as well as large magazines.\n\nWe will use this law as both a carrot, and a stick. Extremists will be able to sell their weapons in a government buy back if they wish to quit politics, and those who hold on to their illegal weapons will be breaking the law and thus be easy to arrest."
 NIK_demexpansion_ban_unregistered_armed_groups_desc:0 "Beyond limiting access to weaponry, the government will also legislate paramilitaries out of existence. Outside of the army of the Republic, the police, as well as a few state backed militias, belonging to an group will be a criminal offense. Those who cling to their paramilitary membership will be arrested on terrorism charges; those who resist will be shot.\n\nThe designation of all those organizations as terrorist groups will allow us to hit their finances, starving them out of money. Violent confrontation need not end everyone of them, as the dwindling money and prestige of paramilitary sees these group hemorrhage members and morale."

We have brought the Republic to order. Political extremism has been quelled, and peace and justice are the order of the day.\n\nSome might question Komi continuing to call itself "a place for all", in light of this quelled extremism. We stand by this statement, for all are welcome into the house of governments who will respect its institutions. Sacred hospitality is a two way obligation. Being now rid of those who would threaten others in our midst, we can continue to work on making the Republic a refuge for all Russians in this age of strife."

The Republic's politicians are sharp, adept at political deals, trained by the ruthless nature of power in the Republic. Yes, this system's excesses have almost derailed our project. But why toss out the baby with the bathwater?\n\nThe unwritten rules will be codified. The radicals will be given their area to play in; as long as they respect the rules of the game, we will let them operate. In turn they will have to work with us as the Republic marches out against its rivals in Russian reunification.\n\nAfter all, might not the extremists be content with their own piece of the cake, once the Republic stretches from Finland to Manchuria?"

What's more, a great deal of these thugs are officially soldiers and officers of the republic. Were we to purge extremism from our army, a great deal of experience would be bled out from the institution.\n\nWe will offer these crooks a deal: fight for us, or be hammered by the law. Any weapon and supplies that are brought from paramilitary control back into official use will be rewarded, and former paramilitaries who prove especially willing to work with us will see their army career given a slight boost."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_vilegodsk_conference_desc:0 "To show our goodwill to the far right and far left, a conference in Vilegodsk has been called to help establish a legal framework of spheres of influences within the republic. Political organizations will be allowed to run schools, unions, news agencies and other such services for their own community, with oversight from the central government.\n\nThe ability to live separately from offensive sociopolitical groups within a clearly defined framework will assuage fears that the central government is one decree away from outlawing personal rights. In return, high level members of sociopolitical groups will be in constant communication and coordination with the central government, all in the spirit of showing loyalty to the Republic and a commitment to keeping the system alive."
 NIK_demexpansion_centralize_redistricting_desc:0 "Woe to the conquered!\n\nOur willingness to cooperate with extremists who recognize their defeat should not be misunderstood for a willingness to turn the other cheek and forget past misdeeds. As such, our government will create a new centralized redistricting office that will be in charge of designing the Republic's electoral constituencies.\n\nUsing this technique we will harvest a bounty of centrist deputies who will help strengthen our grip on the legislative and executive wings of government. This will allow us to pummel renegade extremists, and tempt those willing to compromise to join us at the negotiating table."

We welcomed the accursed and the forsaken. Now our freedoms must be protected and upheld by those who would strip it away forever. We are an island of light and tolerance in a sea of darkness. Unfortunately the shadow clinging to our borders has taken root at home. Infighting infests the Republican Army not too dissimilar from cancer. Factionalism has set root from the squad level up to entire regiments being divided along ideological lines. We must break up these formations and reform them with a pluralistic mix, led by officers loyal to the ideals of the state than any self avowed creed. Already a new generation of military men are being instructed and trained to take command.\n\nAll that is required is the order."

The experience of our men and the vast scope of personalities and ideas within our army grants us the flexibility needed to tackle any enemy!\n\nAt least, so goes the theory. The extremists have quieted down for now. We can only hope that they keep their end of the bargain, lest internecine squabbles threaten to destroy our Republic once more."
 NIK_demexpansion_peace_for_now_desc:0 "Perhaps just a passing dream? The streets of our capital are quiet, for once. A few families are seen walking about where once thugs manned barricades and checkpoints.\n\nThe police reports echo this anomaly. Peace seems to have descended on Syvtyvkar. A fragile peace perhaps, for the demons of civil strife might return if we are not vigilant. A fragile peace, if our rivals in western Russia try to end our democratic experiment. A peace, nonetheless, and one we intend to defend by force.\n\nCitizens, much remains to be done. We must be vigilant, so that our nation's future is not dashed against the rocks of war nor the chaos of internal conflict."
 NIK_demexpansion_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc:0 "The Republic, once seeing its electoral system frayed and closing down due to extremism, must see democracy flourish again.\n\nRegenerating the interest and trust our citizens have in the democratic process will be tough, especially coming on the tail end of our efforts to end political extremism once and for all. We must accomplish this nevertheless, if the democratic center's power is to be assured.\n\nLetting go of our power to design electoral districts now that they have been sanitized will help restore confidence. As will the ability to call snap elections to remove governments that are wildly unpopular with the electorate. Finally, propaganda campaigns extolling the virtue of engaged citizens will hopefully draw crowds once more to polling stations."

No riskier, however, than ruling in content of majority to further the end of small political cliques like our enemies in the far left and far right intended to do.\n\nOur new electoral cycle is set to hold election around the time our army and diplomatic service is set to have reunited many regions of western Russia. Holding an election in freshly annexed or liberated territory must be difficult. But through this our new citizens will see our commitment to democratic ideals!"

Our government prepares a new declaration, announcing that we alone have the legitimacy to rule all of Russia as the Russian Republic. All of our institutions are to change to reflect this. Territory occupied by our military will merely be territory returning to our rightful rule. Diplomatic annexations will be undertaken under the auspices of bringing rogue provincial governors and usurpers back under the fold of the reborn Russian Republic.\n\nOur regional rivals are not likely to take this seriously. As such, we must be ready to prove our claims through force of arm... or through the silver-tongue of our diplomats.

Flawed as they were, the constitutions of the late imperial regime, of Kerensky's failed republic, and of the Soviet Union itself are all sources of ideas. Each of the ruling coalition's democratic parties are likely to have good suggestions. We can also expect reformed extremists to attend.

 NIK_stalexpansion_devolve_judicial_power_desc:0 "The judicial process in Komi is fair, but also inefficient and slow. With so many radicals opposing our government, and so many trials to process, reforms have to be made. President Stalina has authorized the powers of the judicial courts to be extended to the police precincts and military. This will allow for the police and military to set up courts of their own, so that extremists and criminals can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. While some may call this undemocratic, and fear that this will be used to purge anyone who disagrees with the government, it is simply the only way to proceed. Once the crisis has passed, we can discuss this matter in more depth."

Russia has been a dangerous place in recent times, and we would not deprive our citizens of the right to arm themselves for protection and self-defence. Yet in the wrong hands, these weapons could pose a threat to our brave soldiers. We shall have to conduct background checks on the citizen population, making sure there are none with extremist sympathies hiding in our midst, seizing the firearms of any who poses a threat. They will be much more useful in the hands of our men."

Those who resist will be met with the full force of the law. Some will complain about the stripping of their liberties, but such people do not know that freedom can only be built on the basis of a secure, orderly society. They will learn."

However, there are still many radicals who may try to seize power as we expand into more territories. Similarly, as we come to control regions that were once under communist or despotist rule, we may be at risk of a partisan uprising. These territories that have never known democracy may not be in favor of our government. We should continue our efforts to educate these people and eliminate the threats of radicals and partisans, and we will not stop until our republic is secured."

Its members consist of PSD politicians, police commanders, trade union leaders, and military officers, serving as an upper house of sorts for the Reconstruction Government. The Council will propose and pass policy during this time of crisis, give advice and consent to decisions made by the President, and have sole authority to ratify treaties. The National Reconstruction Council shall act as a parallel body to the National Assembly, but will be more reliable due to all of the members being appointed directly by the President herself."

What these critics don't seem to understand is that these are all temporary protective measures, to ensure that the Republic does not fall once again.\n\nTo combat these claims, President Stalina shall take a break from her busy schedule to promise that the National Assembly's power shall be returned shortly, and that the Reconstruction Government will be disbanded once the crisis has passed. Hopefully, this will end their useless panicking."

President Stalina has decided to refuse to guarantee the temporary nature of these policies, seeing it as unnecessary and a distraction from her busy schedule. Instead, President Stalina has chosen to extend her emergency powers indefinitely, and she will cease using them once they are no longer necessary. The Reconstruction Government operates on a need-to-know basis, and currently, that is all the National assembly needs to know. If they have a problem with this information, President Stalina suggests submitting a complaint to the National Reconstruction Council, who will address such complaints once there is enough time available to do so."

This ends now. Only by issuing a series of Fundamental Directives that order their arrests and removals from society can we restore the stability that they destroyed. Who is an extremist will be decided later- what matters now is that they must be eliminated."
 NIK_stalexpansion_liquidate_anti_democratic_apparatus_desc:0 "With the continued consolidation of the Republic, it has become clear to the Reconstruction Government that democracy may not be restored promptly without more and more decisive action. The time for legislation and temporary police crackdowns is over - the time has come. We must rid ourselves of the Far-Left and the Far-Right, for good. Their members will be arrested. No matter how large they are, or irrelevant, they will be annihilated."
 NIK_stalexpansion_a_blueprint_for_integration_desc:0 "The more the Republic expands, the more difficult it is for us to properly integrate these new territories into the central government- that is, unless we come up with a distinct plan on how to train and send in new administrators into these territories in a swift but orderly manner. New departments and governments will need to be set up as soon as our armies conquer them, while leaders from regions peacefully incorporated into the state must be integrated into the government of Komi as soon as possible in order to create a stable platform for expansion."
 NIK_stalexpansion_democracy_is_non_negotiable_desc:0 "Nothing is more sacred on this green Earth than the right for people to take part in the government, but despots and extremists refuse to recognise this. Hence, it is by the guns and tanks of the Komi Army that the light of democracy is carried to the furthest depths of Russia. Hence, we must issue an ultimatum to all the tyrannies and despotates that we encounter on the road to reunification: accept integration into the Republic, or war. Democracy is non-negotiable, and these thugs must learn this lesson the hard way, if need be."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_road_to_enduring_freedom_desc:0 "The protection of liberty and democracy in the Republic was long and difficult; some agitators even claim that our methods go against the ideals that we have uphold so dearly. We cannot listen to these rabble-rousers. Since the inception of our nation, the freedom that is so much a part of Komi's identity was besieged by extremists within and without, and it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. As long as it is under attack, we must endure that long road to freedom, facing whatever obstacle comes in our way with courage and determination."

 NIK_second_election_start_desc:0 "With our liberation of the West, we are closer than ever to realizing the dream of the February Revolution: A truly democratic Russia. Now that we govern West Russia and have transcended the simple borders of the old Komi Republic, it's time to hold [NIK.GetName]'s first official elections. For many West Russians, this will be their first free election. They are excited to head to the polls.\n\nThree parties have thrown their hats into the ring: The democratic socialist §PDSNP§! headed by [GetNIKSocDemLeader], the centrist §MPSD§! under Svetlana Stalina, and the liberal §YSMR§! fielding Alexei Kosygin. The [GetYear] elections are sure to be a close race, and whoever wins will decide the fate of West Russia for 4 more years. The race is on!"
 NIK_second_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc:0 "[GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] isn't perfect, but he's perfect for West Russia. The working man in Russia has no better choice than the founder of modern Russian democracy. The DSNP blends the best of old Soviet socialism with new democratic institutions to create a democratic socialist party that protects workers' lives and liberties.\n\nThe DSNP will get a head start on their election campaign. [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] will criss-cross [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting his Presidential record and plans for the future. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc:0 ""West Russians, workers, countrymen, you have been liberated. Some of you have been liberated from noblemen, juntas, and collaborators who expected you to work to make them richer. Some of you have been liberated from authoritarian communists who valued you only for your output as a line item in a centrally planned budget. But now you have a true friend in your government. Our party fights for you, not for your servitude. We fight that you may earn a fair wage for fair work, that you may feel secure from job precarity, and that you may retire with a well-deserved pension. We are the DSNP, and we are your party."\n\n[GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] will go on a speaking tour in factories across [NIK.GetName]. He will play to the party's industrial base and promote himself as a friend of the working class. By shoring up support from our core constituency, we should have a strong showing in the election."
 NIK_second_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc:0 "Since many of our voters are new to our party, it would be wise to teach them what we stand for. West Russia needs to know what our ideology and policies are if we are to win a mandate in the 1968 elections.\n\nThe DSNP will publish their party platform across [NIK.GetName]. In it, they will detail their plans for wage, occupational safety, and pension reform. They will also make it clear that their ultimate goals are to reunify the whole of Russia and apply their pro-worker agenda across all of its regions. Nobody with a heart could oppose this platform!"
 NIK_second_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc:0 "[NIK.GetName] is a new and unstable country. Many of its people have only recently been amalgamated into it, and have never experienced a free election in their lives. The last thing they need is more utopian visions by ersatz wings of the old Center bloc. Only Svetlana Stalina's PSD can provide the order and stability that Russia so desperately craves.\n\nThe PSD will get a head start on their election campaign. Stalina will criss-cross [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting her commitment to political stability and moderate plans for reform. As many West Russians will be choosing her for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "If the people of West Russia want anything, it's stability. Having experienced the collapse of the Union at the hands of the Nazis, control of their homes changing hands between different warlords again and again, and finally reunification under [NIK.GetName], they need an end to the chaos in their lives. They'll be glad to know that Stalina is just the woman for the job.\n\nThe PSD will publish its platform across the country. It will detail plans for rapid reclamation of the unliberated zones to restore the old Russia. It will mention their social democratic economic policies and protections for free speech, but will also emphasize their expansion of the military and police with an aim to create a safe and secure West Russia. This should capture the hearts of the many weary West Russians now joined to our republic."
 NIK_second_election_an_appeal_to_force_desc:0 ""While West Russians may now breathe free, the wolves lurking at our borders hunger for their blood. The DSNP and SMR may wax enthusiastic about their social 'reforms', but none of them can tell you how they'll keep you safe from an invasion. But our party has an answer: Funding the finest military in Russia."\n\nThe PSD will appeal to national defense in order to rally votes. They will unveil a plan to double defense spending and purchase state of the art equipment from overseas. Peace comes from superior firepower, and voters will know that only the PSD can keep the peace in [NIK.GetName]."
 NIK_second_election_the_SMR_campaign_desc:0 "The Komi Republic began with a dream; a dream that one day all Russia would be one, democratic, and free. A dream that prosperity would abound from Murmansk to Magadan, not because it was planned by party bureaucrats, but because Russia's leaders trusted its people to build it themselves. Now that the Komi Republic has been transcended by [NIK.GetName] we can shed the shackles of the old Center bloc that kept the dream down; Alexei Kosygin and the SMR alone will make that dream come true.\n\nThe SMR will get a head start on their election campaign. Kosygin will criss-cross [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting his beautiful vision of liberty and prosperity. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc:0 ""You Russian students are the builders of the new tomorrow. The DSNP only cares for men who swing a wrench and the PSD chide you to 'follow your elders,' the same elders who let our nation fall to the Germans. I have a different message, dear youth: Russia needs you. It needs your creativity. It needs the diligence you show in your studies. It needs your mastery of the arts and sciences. Most of all, it needs your courage to stand up to the old failures and create new successes. An SMR Russia is your Russia, and it will be the Russia of your grandchildren when you retire to a life of comfort and culture."\n\nKosygin will launch a speaking tour across [NIK.GetName]'s universities. He will campaign hard for the youth vote. While the youth may seem an odd choice of a support base, their dedication to him now will likely last their whole lives; Kosygin is nothing if not forward-thinking. This should help give us an edge in the 1968 elections."
 NIK_second_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc:0 "Kosygin is the man with the plan. He always was ever since he'd saved Russian industry during the war by organizing the Eastward evacuation, and he's going to save [NIK.GetName] now with his extensive reforms. He will unveil to all the people of West Russia his blueprint for their future.\n\nThe SMR will publish their platform across [NIK.GetName]. It will detail their affirmative action plans for Russia's women and ethnic minorities, as well as their blueprint for expanding private enterprise to increase economic growth. While the platform will uphold the socialist roots of the SMR, it will portray them as focused first and foremost on the personal liberty and prosperity of every West Russian. This message should resonate with the electorate, many of whom will have their first taste of real freedom."
 NIK_second_election_let_the_race_begin_desc:0 "Campaigning season is over and [NIK.GetName] is heading to the polls. Each candidate put up a good fight, and analysts see this election as anyone's game. Russians will soon gather around their radio sets to hear the final tallies and find out who will lead their nation for the next 5 years: [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast]'s democratic socialists, Stalina's stability-minded centrists, or Kosygin's liberal democrats.\n\nMany will be elated by the results, others dismayed. Yet one thing all can agree on is that a free and fair election was finally held across West Russia; a triumph in a land that has never known a peaceful transfer of power. No matter who wins the most votes, democracy has won in [NIK.GetName]."

 ### DEMOCRATIC REGIONALS DESCS ###
 NIK_voznesensky_a_socialist_mandate_desc:0 "As Russia roils and bleeds around us, we must cling to the principles which have brought us this far: to the ideals of our Constitution. Not for us the tyranny of the Eurasianists, not for us the violence of the Communist Left, and not for us the falsehoods and demagoguery of radicalism! In this and only this do we place our trust: a dedication to Democratic Socialism, one which is beholden neither to the will of an iron hierarchy nor to the nightmarish callings of frenzied agitators.\nYes, Socialism! We dare use that term divorced from the tyrant-Bolsheviks of old, for unlike those who would plaster a Red Tsardom to their walls to keep them safe, we are not afraid of listening to the people - and we are not afraid of acting on what we hear. Only Socialism can keep us loyal to our people, and only Democracy can keep Socialism true to its course. There can be no other option."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_new_republic_desc:0 "The old Republic was broken by its own best intentions: as Social Democracy was built it absorbed the dregs of every ideology across the political spectrum. A paradox of tolerance was at work, where at every opportunity we promoted the principles that we held so dear, and at every opportunity radicals used our idealism to undermine our grip. Now, as the President consolidates his grip, we will have an opportunity to truly express our beliefs in a purified form.\n\nA form where all will truly breathe free without inconvenient enemies and their alluring agitation-politics. A form where the worst of Voznesensky's opponents, and without a doubt the Republic's enemies by extension, can be discredited once and for all. A new Republic - and a different Russia."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_free_electoral_commission_desc:0 "Electoral Commissions were a controversial introduction to the old Republic, as repeated efforts to suborn the legitimacy of these Commissions by our associated extremist fringes made every election a headache. That said, our elections are still in desperate need of neutral third-party observation to ensure that said extremist fringe never again regains a hold on our electoral scene. We will introduce a new Commission to solve these problems, one whose neutrality will be firmly guarded by the President and the Head of the Legislature to keep the powers of state in check.\n\nThere are some who claim that the Electoral Commission is in fact simply one more tool in our President's pocket, and that there are in fact widespread claims that the Commission is as steeped in money as its predecessor. These extremist calls will be disregarded as the treasonous claims they are. The truth is this: we are the instrument of the People's Will.\n\nThose that disagree are more than welcome to take it up with us in person."
 NIK_voznesensky_an_urban_rural_platform_desc:0 "Democracy in Russia is like navigating a tightrope - one is perpetually forced to navigate between two worlds, each with vastly different requirements and lived experiences. Just as Janus was two-faced, so too must we adopt a two-faced approach: to look to the world of the village and the world of the urbanite and balance both their needs. Thankfully, Vosnesensky's long experience in Government has given him an intuitive grasp on these two chambers of the heart of Russia.\n\nWe will adopt a mixed approach, pushing for the gradual integration of the economy through separate, equal development. The farmer shall be given an equal voice and support for his labor, on an equal platform with the laborer at the factory, and we shall push for the organization of a true Farmer-Labor working class that can stand as one despite their asymmetrical backgrounds. Only when the two chambers of the Russian Heart beat as one shall Russia be united!"
 NIK_voznesensky_stand_for_democracy_desc:0 "There are certain ideals for which we cannot afford to compromise: chief among them would be our oft-quoted support for true Democratic ideals. This is what separates us from the radical rabble to our left and right - our absolute, unyielding conviction that the people alone can decide their mandate, and that no group of stuffed suits should decide the course of the Nation alone. As such, we must develop a new mandate, a Compact with the People, that will appeal to the men and women of Russia. Their alienation must not be allowed to fester, lest it consume the body politic in the sickness of extremism.\n\nA healthy level of propagandization about just how committed we are, accompanied by quiet suppression of the remnants of the old extremist groups, will keep our citizens on the straight and narrow - and a rhetorical focus on progressive legislation will convince them that we are on their side. A carrot and stick approach might not be particularly sophisticated, but that is the beauty of politics, yes?"
 NIK_voznesensky_democratic_idealism_desc:0 "Just as the poets fled to Tomsk, so too did the tired and huddled masses to the old Republic - despite all that has happened here, we retain that essential spark of democratic energy, that infallible belief that our voices matter. This is what kept the Old Republic going, even as its institutions fell apart around us and the stresses of extremism dragged it into the muck - and it is this idealism that will empower us to build a new dream, stronger and better than the old.\n\nA push for unionism, continued efforts to weed out irregularities in our voting system, and the expansion of our voting system to ensure all walks of life will have an equal say in elections - we are writing into law our passion for Democracy, and our love shall spill onto the streets of our shared home. May Russia live and breathe free, for as long as we draw breath we shall never cease in pulling her towards the public good."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_united_government_desc:0 "For all our talk of democracy, a certain degree of electoral unity is necessary to ensure our legislative branch is not vulnerable to the attacks that crippled our forebears. We must strive for a government that is both attuned to the popular voice and unfettered in their capability to carry out that which is mandated to us. As such, we will continue the broad-based United Coalition strategy - the extremist elements which we collaborated with, however, will no longer be welcome.\n\nInstead, we will pull in diverse elements from all across society, creating a truly broad-based party capable of responding to popular demands. Unionists, soldiers and street-sweepers shall all have their voices heard in our Coalition, and minor parties pressured into upholding their interests as well - this might fragment the power of our opposition, but democracy is not about opposition, is it not? After all, it is not competition, but representation, that makes Russia great. Why would we ever change that?"
 NIK_voznesensky_a_party_consensus_desc:0 "If we are ever to get our Government in Order, our control of our own Party must be an overriding priority. The DSNP is a hidebound institution, having inherited much of our factionalist divides from the old era, and even though our opponents are firmly out of office we must ensure that secondary allegiances are wholly uprooted to keep the Party vital. Dedication to the common interest and our party platform will be strictly enforced on members and legislators, with dissent punished by expulsion.\n\nWe will also develop grassroots organizations to keep our party members loyal, developing community ties to local leadership that will sustain our members' electoral campaigns - this support comes with inevitable compromises, and even weakness to the influence of the Party on important issues, but it is all necessary to keep their best interests aligned with our own. Otherwise, what would be the point of the Party in the first place?"
 NIK_voznesensky_relentless_progress_desc:0 "The political position our party finds itself is already described by contemporaries as "Democratic Hegemony", with a majority of the seats ensuring us practically full control of the legislative, provided we avoid internal strife and the party acts as a single block. This has to lead many of our representatives to doubt the usefulness of the Democratic front and cooperation with rightists as a whole, seeing how there's no need for painful compromises when we can wrestle control of the legislative on our own.\n\nWhile this may be a controversial move to make, we might have to agree with these circles and start distancing ourselves from the other parties. After all, the people of Russia haven't given the DSNP a vote of confidence for it to be bogged down by uncooperative conservatives."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_doctrine_of_compromise_desc:0 "While the DSNP holds the dominant position in the Assembly, its status as the ruling party is secured by a rather small margin, with support from the other democratic parties often necessary to ensure an indisputable majority.\n\nThough a good portion of our own deputies is dissatisfied with this state of dependence on rightist politicians and factions to pass our own legislation, our leadership has to recognize the unfortunate truth, that maintaining the Democratic Front with moderate rightists is the only way to ensure unity of the political center, for without it the republic would fall to extremism."
 NIK_voznesensky_past_the_scandals_desc:0 "Though the DSNP is the guarantor of prosperity in the republic and the party that unified Western Russia under the banner of democracy, it has eventually become evident that the pedestal of popular support it's so used to enjoying is quite brittle. With every scandal as minor as a single bribe, the public perception of our apparatus shifts from praise to condemnation, and many say that since its ascension to power the party has been permeated with crooked bureaucrats and thieving executives.\n\nWhile over the years these scandals have become the new normal, as public opinion eventually stabilizes after each one, and any outrage so far has been relatively minor, eventually any of them might spiral out of control, and the ensuing political crisis may cost our party it's ruling place or even the permanent stability of the republic. To prevent such a disaster, we should improve our public image, which will ultimately secure genuine popular support we so desperately require. The recent reunification should serve well to be presented as the moment when the DSNP was reborn from a den of corruption that has abandoned its founding principles. Now it has become a truly democratic association struggling for popular welfare, that is built on the principles of honesty and open government.\n\nAs such, initiatives have been approved for local anti-corruption campaigns, showing the electorate that the party acknowledges its problems and is ready to fight them openly. Whether this will prove effective is another question entirely, though this will be the first step on the way to overcoming the distrust many feel towards the DSNP."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_populist_agenda_desc:0 "Not so long ago, in the disunited lands of Russia, populism was employed by many a warlord to justify their rule. As such, some view it as a natural tool of a cruel age, invented by despots to bamboozle their subjects.\n\nHowever, we in the halls of power clearly see the benefits of populism - promising a better future to the people, fostering unity between them and the government, and securing their trust in our mandate are all beneficial to democracy as much as to any would-be dictator. Let us cultivate healthy populism in our party program, ensuring popular support in our march to progress."
 NIK_voznesensky_an_all_russian_autonomy_commission_desc:0 "The territory of Russia, in the historical process of her expansion, has absorbed the lands of many ethnicities, their population varying from millions to mere hundreds, each with a culture, unlike the others. Since the days of the October revolution, Lenin's government, believing in the principles of self-determination, granted the peoples of the new Soviet Union significant autonomy, the legacy of which we still carry, our republic itself having emerged from the Komi ASSR.\n\nWith our authority now extending throughout all of Western Russia, "The Autonomy Question" as it came to be known, has become a more significant issue, with notable figures from various ethnicities dissatisfied with the current status quo. While outright secessionists are few and irrelevant, we could satisfy the wishes of moderate particularist circles by introducing a separate body to improve the status of minorities and serve as an intermediary between the central government and the autonomies in matters where direct control is unnecessary. While some criticize this as "soft separatism" and "subversion of ethnic equality", many agree that this is the only way to guard the many ethnicities of Russia from the tyranny of the majority."
 NIK_voznesensky_prioritize_majoritarian_concerns_desc:0 "As Russia always has been a multinational state, her many former governments left a number of ethnic policies for our republic to inherit, including Bolshevik self-rule in various autonomies, which we currently practice in a slightly amended form, adapted for our democratic system. Though intended to grant the needed freedoms to the minorities, since the unification many are expressing disapproval of this system, calling for even greater autonomy.\n\nThis notion, though fitting the DSNP's general line, has been met with staunch opposition in the Assembly, with some especially vocal critics branding it as "eroding the principle of universal equality the republic is built on, through giving the minorities undemocratic overrepresentation". Many of the more moderate deputies are abstaining from the direct debate, but are evidently opposed to shaking up the status quo. While we could still force the initiative through, it could undermine the party's stability, and perhaps even sabotage the democracy we struggled so much to build. As such, we better forget about this proposal as soon as possible and move on to more pressing matters."
 NIK_voznesensky_extend_social_welfare_desc:0 "One of the key elements of any socialist agenda, ours not being an exception, is the promise of welfare for citizens of the state. Many fought for us on the fields of battle and gave us their vote to ensure this better tomorrow for their children, and it's due time we honored this promise.\n\nWith the initial stage of the long-awaited Reunification complete, we have achieved precious peace, allowing us to turn the necessary attention inwards, to finally build a working system of social welfare for all."
 NIK_voznesensky_campaign_for_the_disadvantaged_desc:0 "Despite our recent general welfare campaign, many of our citizens remain in a powerless and downtrodden state, experiencing difficulties with integration into the Republic's social and political environment. The Reunification, though it brought democracy to the people of Russia robbed many of their old way of life, leaving them stranded on the border between conflicting values and realities of their new life.\n\nSuch people, when not shielded from uncalled hardships, often turn to more radical options, aiming to tear down the society they view as downtrodding. As such, before the disadvantaged turn into radicals and terrorists, we must lend them a helping hand in integration."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_shining_precedent_desc:0 "Though for years our rivals and critics argued that a functional democracy could not exist within the brutal realities of warlordism and banditry that plagued Russia since her defeat, our new republic has disproven this claim by the fact of its very existence! It withstood the onslaught of radicals within and without, right and left, and has carried the torch of popular freedom from the Volga and to the White Sea. Breaking the expectations of the cynical, it has triumphed in war as well as peace, fighting for progress across both the fields of battle and halls of government. Our efforts here have established a precedent, that will outlast any tyranny, for, in the hearts and minds of the people, our republic shall persist through the hardest of crises.\n\nThree hurrahs for Russia! Three hurrahs for Democracy!"

 NIK_stalina_the_reconstruction_government_desc:0 "Our government, tasked with the salvation of the Republic, and eventually - Russia, has secured the West of the country, and it is now our duty to protect it from threats within and without. We shall do all in our power to wipe out extremists, restore prosperity and stability in the lives of our citizens, and eventually step down, leaving Russia united and free.\n\nThis herculean mission will not be finished in a day, a month, or perhaps even in years, but Russia's history has taught us that rallied under a strong authority, she overcame countless challenges before, and we are here to ensure she shall do so again."
 NIK_stalina_strengthen_the_institutions_desc:0 "Our main task, other than securing stability, is to ensure that the new democracy that will arise in the place of our Emergency Government, never meets the fate of the old one, crushed by shady backroom deals, informal agreements, intrigue, and powerplays beyond competency.\n\nIf we are to establish a New Republic, then at its center must stand legitimate institutions backed by public trust, with their offices having strictly defined limits of power and authority, so that biased and informal cliques will shackle Russia no longer."
 NIK_stalina_crack_down_on_corruption_desc:0 "Unfortunately for our cause, even an apparatus tasked with saving democracy itself is not immune to corruption. Thankfully, with the broadened powers granted to the emergency government under the pretext of national salvation will allow us to confront crooks and thieves directly, in these trying times, when corruption is little less than treason and should be stamped out, lest it finishes the republic in its moment of weakness."
 NIK_stalina_a_stabilizing_thaw_desc:0 "It seems our promise to eventually restore democracy was perceived quite differently by the populace, with some circles already making demands to start gradual liberalization in their areas of interest, arguing that the worst is behind us.\n\nWhile a few hardliners and military figures disagree, honoring a popular request will yield us much-needed credibility as a government on guard of democracy, and loosening press censorship and the like will help maintain the normality of life in a free society."
 NIK_stalina_a_supervised_state_desc:0 "With us explicitly defining the Reconstruction Government as a temporary measure to protect the republic's democracy, the rapidly rising campaigns to reintroduce freedoms have only begun to get in the way of our decision-making. While most of those groups are harmless, some movements, particularly those for the reintroduction of press freedoms, are particularly outspoken critics, and thus cannot be ignored.\n\nThough some are calling to listen to those demands, it would be more rational to silence them with a decisive refusal - liberalizing now would only defeat the point of the state of emergency by giving forces aiming to destabilize the nation a legal means of distributing their agitation. For as long as the Reconstruction Government holds, we'll have to maintain those restrictions in the name of stability and safety of our citizens."
 NIK_stalina_the_militarys_approval_desc:0 "Though the Emergency Government was largely formed by an agreement between Stalina's supporters in the National Assembly, and pro-democratic officers subordinated to Grigorenko, the two have since acted independently of each other, only cooperating explicitly in the initial securing of power.\n\nIf we are to move forward, we'll have to tighten the cooperation between those who protect the Republic in the halls of government and those who do their duty in the army. Thankfully, Stalina's close friendship with Grigorenko can help coerce him into directing the army to support the initiatives of the Government directly, cracking down on radicals and ensuring stability in the streets. Of course, this agreement will not be like the unspoken alliances of plotting bureaucrats in the old republic, with the military's full subordination to the president being formally codified."
 NIK_stalina_the_renewed_defense_of_the_republic_act_desc:0 "In order to maintain a strong enough army to unify all of Russia, we need to increase conscription. Unfortunately, we are facing a problem regarding conscription. Several loopholes exist in our conscription laws that allow many of our able-bodied citizens to avoid being conscripted.\n\nAs such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have decided to draft a new piece of legislation, the Defense of the Republic Act. this ensures that our citizens can't exploit loopholes to get out of service. Alongside dealing with loopholes, the Defense of the Republic Act renews the four-year conscription periods. If we are to reunite the Motherland, we need all hands on deck."
 NIK_stalina_the_national_sovereignty_act_desc:0 "Russia possesses many strategic resources, the most valuable to our government being oil. However, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government feel that we give out these resources too easily, allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies. This is absurd, and something has to be done to rectify this matter.\n\nIntroducing the National Sovereignty Act. This law severely limits the exports of strategic resources to nations without defensive ties to the Motherland. In short, if a nation wants our resources, they must declare themselves an ally of the Russian Republic. This shall make the Russian Republic a more attractive ally to nations within the international community, and will help protect the Motherland. At the end of the day, that is all that matters."
 NIK_stalina_the_executive_directive_act_desc:0 "During times of crisis, the nation can't stop to wait for the mire of bureaucracy. As such, President Stalina - through the recently created Executive Directive Act - has been granted the ability to issue directives to handle any crisis that threatens national security unilaterally.\n\nThis allows President Stalina to govern quickly and efficiently, side-stepping all of the red tape that would normally impede her actions. Some may protest this further centralization of power, but the Executive Directive Act is a necessary step towards the goal of a united Motherland. President Stalina guided the Republic through a time of crisis once before, and she will likely have to do so repeatedly in the future. Our enemies will not wait patiently for our government to come to a consensus."
 NIK_stalina_the_party_registry_act_desc:0 "It is clear to the Reconstruction Government that the organizations that are allowed to participate in our government must be more thoroughly vetted in order to safeguard the Republic. As such, President Stalina has approved the Party Registry Act.\n\nAll political parties and organizations that wish to operate within the Republic must be officially approved and investigated, to ensure that they are not affiliated with extremist groups. This process shall be carried out by a wholly impartial and unbiased state-run body. While it may be staffed solely with former PSD members, these men and women have sworn to govern solely in the interests of the Republic, and would never allow bias to creep into their judgements. Any who doubt these comments can submit their complaints to the National Reconstruction Council, to be considered once there is enough time available to do so."
 NIK_stalina_empower_the_party_desc:0 "The PSD is currently the largest party in our Republic, and is home to a variety of centrist ideologies. However, the party's current structure does not allow for the various factions within our party to be heard. As such, the PSD must evolve: it shall become the 'Party of Power.' With this restructuring, the PSD will allow for greater discussion between its various actions, with greater ideological variety inside the party than outside the party. The PSD already serves as the main party for those who support democracy and stand against radicalism, so any consensus reached within the PSD will effectively be the same as a consensus reached within the legislature. The majority consensus shall apply to all party members, and that consensus shall be reached through free, democratic discussion.\n\nOf course, more radical ideologues will remain outside the party, so that they can't derail discussions with their extremist propaganda."
 NIK_stalina_public_concessions_desc:0 "The PSD and the Reconstruction Government have been highly focused on destroying extremism's influence within the Republic, but it is important that we do not forget our roots. The PSD serves the people, and our policies must reflect this. As such, President Stalina has decided to dedicate funds to the people, in the forms of welfare and pensions. Welfare services and pensions shall be expanded, and our government shall in general ensure that our citizens are taken care of. No citizen shall starve on our streets, no person shall be left without a home in our cities. No veterans shall be left destitute for sacrificing themselves for their country, and no citizen shall need to turn to radicalism merely to survive."
 NIK_stalina_allow_for_a_split_desc:0 "When in the process of establishing the Reconstruction Government the PSD de-facto absorbed the other parties of the democratic front in, many agreed it was a necessary measure. Now, however, even with our efforts to solidify this union, cracks in the system are starting to show, with activists of the former SMR and DSNP aiming to reestablish those parties once again.\n\nAfter a brief period of discussion, many in the administration seem not to mind this, seeing the division of the political center as a natural phenomenon, and agreeing that the old party structure is not to blame for the situation the republic now finds itself in. With Stalina's approval, the two parties are soon to be restored, though many of the deputies are to stay in the PSD securing its status as the sole ruling party in the Reconstriction Government and ensuring full control of it."
 NIK_stalina_keep_the_big_tent_model_desc:0 "On the very onset of the Reconstruction Government's establishment, some deputies expressed concern over the fate of the Republic's democratic landscape, presenting the idea that the only way to recover from this crisis would be to preserve the center coalition, centralized around the PSD, as a broad force of containment against radicals.\n\nWith the question of the former SMR and DSNP cadre leaving the PSD to refound their parties, this suggestion has been bought up again and rallied around by a large fraction in the government, arguing that if the unity of the center would be jeopardized, the democratic forces would fall divided. With this proposal practically guaranteeing governmental stability, Stalina has decided to veto the split, cementing her administration's nature as a grand union of all three former moderate parties, disempowering any remaining real opposition."
 NIK_stalina_ensure_free_elections_desc:0 "Elections, when they are held, shall be free and fair. We cannot make the same mistakes as the previous government, the right to vote for everyone must be upheld. Fair elections will ensure a stable republic and a working, capable democracy.\n\nTo ensure fair elections are upheld, Stalina has authorized for new institutions that promote democracy and freedom be established. These institutions will make sure everyone gets an equal chance to vote. They will also ensure the government does not try to influence or affect the elections themselves or its results. There will be no more chaos at the polls!"
 NIK_stalina_the_constitution_of_national_reconstruction_desc:0 "Until Russia is reunified, the state of emergency must remain in place. To this end, we will enact a new constitution, one that holds true to the values of national reconstruction and anti-extremism. If that means putting a limit on freedoms and individual rights for now, so be it. Our republic has to be protected from the radicals who wish to destroy it, no matter what!"
 NIK_stalina_faith_in_democracy_desc:0 "The state of emergency must end, the government cannot maintain a republic with no elections. We cannot call ourselves a democracy if we do not even follow basic democratic principles! This means - come the end of Stalina's lawful term, elections will be called, and the republic will choose between a new president and Stalina.\n\nEnding the state of emergency will also give the people of the republic more rights and freedoms. Allowing the people to exercise these rights will be the first big test of our remade democracy under Stalina. Hopefully, we will not relive the past."

 NIK_stalina_freedom_sovereignty_patriotism_desc:0 "Svoboda, Suverenitet, i Patriotizm - the motto of the Sovereign Democratic Party. We are the party of strength. We are the party of sovereignty. We are the party that fights for all of the people. And most of all, we are the party for a strong Russia that works for all of its citizens. The people know our platform, and have given us a broad mandate to carry it out. Let us not disappoint them by going back on our promises."
 NIK_stalina_a_democratic_centre_desc:0 "The PSD stands for many things. For freedom and democracy, sure. But for moderation above all. The people of Russia do not need radical and extreme solutions for their problems. Demagogues have destroyed their country, and they do not wish for another one. They want sensible and reasonable solutions that don't affect their lives any more than necessary. The PSD is at the center of politics, and abhors extremism in all forms. Democracy and moderation is our guiding principle. And we will draw a hard line against anyone who goes against it."
 NIK_stalina_survey_republic_elections_desc:0 "Russia is a land of many peoples and ethnicities. Many minorities have a degree of independence, allowing them to have their own republics and elections. We must ensure they retain their autonomy. And part of that is eliminating any corrupting outside influence in these republics.\n\nSmaller units of organization have had issues with election fraud for a long time. No longer will this be tolerated. We will begin keeping a closer eye on these elections, and how they are carried out. Then we can be assured these peoples are truly picking their own destinies."
 NIK_stalina_centralize_election_administration_desc:0 "Free and fair elections must be ensured throughout our republic. And that means fraud cannot be tolerated. We will establish a non-partisan agency, tasked with rooting out and eliminating election fraud and corruption. Election administration will be placed under federal control, although we will make exceptions for local elections in minority republics. Vote-rigging and other such actions are a threat to the very legitimacy of our democracy. And it will be eliminated."
 NIK_stalina_no_room_for_corruption_desc:0 "Russia has gotten a reputation as a place where an elite political class can live off of the wealth squeezed out of the suffering peasants. So it was in the days of the tsars, when rich aristocrats would live in sumptuous mansions surrounded by the grass and mud huts of the serfs. And so it was in the days of the Soviet Union, when party members would race to their dachas in handbuilt limousines, passing the horse-carriages of the Proletariat. No longer! Corruption will be eliminated in Russia. Massive fines await those who seek to use their positions to profit from the people. And there will be no exceptions or tolerance at all."
 NIK_stalina_the_paramount_civic_duty_desc:0 "Any Republic is only as good as the people it represents. Too often, people of other nations have allowed others to do the deciding for them, rather than face their issues head on. The results have been disastrous every time. We will not let that happen here. Voting is key to our democracy, and so is actually running for positions as well. Local elections and referenda are highly important, no less so than national ones. If the people understand this, and act on it, we will secure our democracy for a long time to come."
 NIK_stalina_the_new_russian_century_desc:0 "Tsushima and the Treaty of Portsmouth. Tannenberg and Brest-Litovsk. Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. Russia has been the victim of disastrous defeats and destruction at the hands of foreign powers.But we refuse to let that continue. No longer will the 20th century be known as Russia's century of humiliation. Because with the new republic, Russia once again rises to prominence on the world stage! We shall finally be strong once more, and we shall make this new century into a Russian century - a century with Russia claiming its position as a world power."
 NIK_stalina_accept_the_big_tent_model_desc:0 "Accept the Big-Tent Model"
 NIK_stalina_justice_before_compromise_desc:0 "We won't work across the aisle, and why should we? Who wants to water down our necessary laws and policies, just for the sake of patting ourselves on the back that we worked with a few minority parties? It is unnecessary, as we have the strength to get things done by ourselves, without the consultation of the other parties. Moreover, the people explicitly elected us to do these things, not any other party. They wanted a strictly PSD term, and they got it. And we will not deliver anything less than what we promised."
 NIK_stalina_the_oppositions_finest_desc:0 "Many other opposition parties exist in Russia who will never cooperate with us. Their individual members, however, are another matter. Many opposition members exist who agree with us on at least one issue. Sometimes, more than one. We can try to use that support to help get our bills and reforms passed. Working across the aisles is much easier than just trying to force things through on our own."
 NIK_stalina_roots_for_healthy_competition_desc:0 "Sure, crushing our opposition into the ground with a massive monolithic organization is tempting, but we have more noble goals in mind. Democracy is not one group of people steamrolling the other. It is a group of people of differing perspectives and beliefs coming together to solve their problems. Thus, working with other parties is essential. Merely consolidating our own power at all costs will lead to a single-party state, just like in the Soviet Union."
 NIK_stalina_towards_a_sovereign_future_desc:0 "It is time for the signature policy of the SDP to be unveiled. The National Sovereignty Act will change our diplomatic position forevermore. Strategic resources in Russia, such as oil, will be severely restricted from the international market. But this is not a protectionist act, or one aimed at autarky. These limitations will be lifted for those with defensive ties with our republic. If you want to gain access to our bountiful resources, you must make an alliance with us. And everybody wants these strategic materials."
 NIK_stalina_right_the_pasts_wrongs_desc:0 "Any objective view of Russia's long history will find many shameful acts and practices. The rampant discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The rampant misogyny towards women. And poor treatment of the disabled. And we say "enough!"\n\nWe shall move forward with a socially egalitarian agenda. Our crusade will end and outlaw these practices, and ensure equal treatment under the law. For aren't we all Russians? And aren't Russians guaranteed rights?"
 NIK_stalina_campaign_against_discrimination_desc:0 "For too long, the pogoms and other acts of discrimination have kept Russia as a backward state from the middle ages. Even worse, horrific acts of religious persecution still occur in Russia at this very moment, in our supposedly enlightened time. This will stop immediately. We will grant legal mechanisms and rules for Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities to defend and protect themselves. We will combat pervasive religious hatred with the full force of the law."
 NIK_stalina_charter_of_universal_rights_desc:0 "It's not enough to pass a few rules granting citizens legal rights. We must also codify it into our constitution. The great democracies of the world have unassailable provisions that protect their people, and so will we. And thus, we bring forth an Equal Rights Amendment. Modeled after the Bill of Rights in America, we will make being an egalitarian nation that grants everyone equal rights a permanent feature of Russia. And that is going to be hard for any would-be authoritarian to roll back."
 NIK_stalina_decommunization_and_dewarlordization_desc:0 "Symbols may seem just symbols at first, sure. But to many people, who have suffered under the tyrants of Russia, they are extremely hurtful and terrifying reminders of times we wish to move beyond. And that any political party, no matter how small, will gleefully use these symbols to identify themselves with the monsters of the past is disgusting.\n\nProminent symbols of the communist regime and certain warlords will be banned, except for art and historical purposes. These legacies have no place in modern Russia. And if the people that march under them can't find something new, maybe it's a sign their beliefs should be left in the past as well."
 NIK_stalina_a_united_russia_desc:0 "Russia is still geographically torn asunder. By other warlords in the east. And by the Germans in the west. But though we may not be united in a territorial sense, we are united in a much bigger one. For all Russians are united in spirit. And we are a state that shows this unity more than any other. We march united, and committed. For a Russia united by equality. And a Russia united by a strong national identity. That unity and commitment towards this Russia will see us through till the end."
 NIK_stalina_a_shining_precedent_desc:0 "We have done it. People doubted that the PSD would exercise its authority in a peaceful, constructive, and democratic manner. But we have. Our agenda has been enacted entirely within the confines of the law, and with no extraordinary measures taken. And the will of the people has been respected, to boot. This is a glorious victory for democracy, showing that great change can be accomplished within the system. Let us hope this convinces the population that our system is sustainable and strong as well."
 NIK_stalina_honor_the_republics_heroes_desc:0 "Due to our history as a unifier of western Russia, our Republic is a Republic of heroes. Innumerable men and women fought to make our Republic whole and put down the tyrannical extremists and warlords that once blighted Russia from Arkhangelsk to Samara. After such service to our Republic, we, too, deserve to provide a service to our veterans and heroic soldiers. Veterans of the West Russian War and Unification Wars shall be taken care of, provided with a generous stipident as a reward for their service.\n\nAdditionally, this action presents a wonderful opportunity for the image of our party. Regardless of one's alignment within the PSD, all of our Deputies and regional politicians can at least agree on the fact that Russia's heroes deserve recognition. Let us assist them, and in doing so, assist the longevity of our party's administration."
 NIK_stalina_emphasize_shared_identity_desc:0 "Regardless of our heritage, be we Great Russian, Tatar, Jewish, German, or Ukrainian, we are all united in our participation within our democracy, and our residence within the Republic. Whilst the politicians of the left and right may call out to silence peoples solely for their faith or ethnicities, we have the position above all of them, atop the pinnacle of democracy. Our policy regardign ethnicity, thusly, shall focus on the fact that all of us are citizens of the Republic - participants in the grand democratic experiment that has already liberated so much of our Motherland.\n\nWe may call ourselves Great Russians, or Tatars, or Ukrainians - but, in heart, we are all equal in patriotic humanity."
 NIK_stalina_redeeming_our_history_desc:0 "The streets of the Republic were no longer a battleground for feuding radicals, nor were political assassinations a viable way to mark the passing of the days. The leadership of Svetlana Stalina had cleaned up the behaviour of the people, but it could not wipe away their opinions. The debate of how the history of our Republic should be discussed has become a contentious subject in the halls of legislature, with many calling for a focus on the "Glory of Russia". They say that leftism and division has diluted the common identity of the Russian people, and desire for that to be rectified. The Left has mobilised their political capital against this, but it's the Right who holds the keys to power that are needed for the unification of Russia."

 NIK_authdem_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "After over a decade of German terror bombing and the chronic insecurity caused by the raids of rival warlords, economic activity in our corner of Russia is on life support. Now that the government is stable and we have control over our own borders, resuscitating the economy will be a priority for the new government."
 NIK_authdem_development_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "Komi exists in a dangerous neighborhood, with the Germans to the west and a motley collection of pretender states to the east. While private enterprise and free competition will continue to be encouraged within the Republic, we don't have the luxury of waiting for economic development from the bottom up. Modernity will come to Russia under the leadership of the PSD and the strong guidance of state-owned enterprises in crucial sectors, complementing its private companies. We have no other choice, even if it means that there will be sacrifices asked of the people and the workers along the way."
 NIK_authdem_prioritize_state_development_desc:0 "Getting the economy off the ground is a herculean task in any developing country, even more so in an economy like Russia's, reeling from years of conflict. The PSD has decided that the state must utilize its coffers and manpower to jumpstart the new economy by establishing state-owned enterprises to develop critical sectors of the economy and to advance key infrastructure projects throughout the Republic. Some would call this inefficient, arguing that the state would run these projects at a loss - we answer that nobody else is willing to lay the foundations of a modern economy, and unless they have a better idea, they can stay out of the way!"
 NIK_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_desc:0 "To say the least, Russia is starved of capital. Its productive capacity has been funneled into interminable warfare, and the turbulent political situation has naturally made potential investors extremely cautious to risk putting their funds in enterprises that could easily go bust. Building wealth inside the country takes time that we simply do not have. Attracting investment from outside, on the other hand, is significantly easier.\n\nThe international business community craves new markets, and Russia with its large population and abundant natural resources has a great, untapped potential for profit. Foreign companies can expect low taxes and many potential customers, but they must remember one thing: Russia is a sovereign nation, and they are only there as guests."
 NIK_authdem_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc:0 "The territory of Russia is rich in natural resources - oil, minerals, and crops. Too often, however, these resources are used as a means of personal enrichment for the various warlords, without a care for the development of a modern economy. Now that the Republic is exerting control over a growing swath of Russian territory, we should establish a government agency to take stock of the bounties of Russian soil and to ensure that they are directed for the good of the state and its people."
 NIK_authdem_consolidate_the_defense_industry_desc:0 "If the Republic wants to take the fight to the other pretender states in the East - and, eventually, against the Germans in the West - it is essential that we have a defense industry capable of supplying the vast quantities of equipment our new model military will require. This cannot be done through small enterprises and cottage industries: we must think larger, consolidating our various arms manufacturers to unlock the economies of scale necessary for our growing Republic. Through partial nationalization and state-guided mergers, the PSD government will ensure that our soldiers will never want for bullets or quality equipment."
 NIK_authdem_roads_across_russia_desc:0 "A nation without infrastructure is a nation in name only. Bereft of the connections that allow for commerce and travel, the country is divided, the people's concerns solely local. Russia was once far more connected than it is now; years of bombing and warlordism have caused a retreat, as citizens refuse to stray further from their immediate places of residence. Although there have been minor improvements as local governments build for their own purposes, much of the country remains far behind the Soviet era in this regard.\n\nIf Russia is to reemerge onto the world stage, the Republic needs to forcibly tackle this crisis. The revitalization of our road infrastructure will allow commerce to expand and fuel economic growth, as well as incalculably improving the lot of ordinary people through the expansion of work opportunities."
 NIK_authdem_an_economy_for_us_all_desc:0 "As economic improvement takes Russia into the modern age, we must be careful to avoid the concentration of increased material wealth into too few hands. The economy is growing particularly in urban areas, with the potential of leaving rural localities behind, and businesses often invest so much in improving physical capital and managerial salaries that they leave nothing for their citizens. As all of the veterans of Syktyvkar's turbulent political scene know, inequality causes resentment, which can and frequently does lead to political instability.\n\nKeeping wealth from becoming excessively concentrated naturally requires government action. Welfare programs, stringent regulations, and taxation on unscrupulous businesses should keep inequality in check, ensuring that Russia's prosperity is truly enjoyed by all."
 NIK_authdem_aid_for_the_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "Cut off from the outside world by constant turmoil, Russia's farmers have suffered long, difficult years. Between a general lack of feed, modern equipment, infrastructure, and customers, the agricultural sector has been squeezed from all sides. Without a steady influx of food from a strong farming base, building up a country is impossible. It is for this reason that agricultural aid is a necessity for economic improvement.\n\nThrough extensive subsidies, loans, and other forms of financial assistance, the government can revitalize the Russian agricultural sector, and not soon enough; as our growing cities teem with hungry mouths to feed, we need as much food as we can get."
 NIK_authdem_national_recovery_initiatives_desc:0 "The PSD has great plans for the rejuvenation of the Russian nation and people, but none of that will come to fruition without mobilizing the people for the cause. The government will establish sweeping programs for public works, industrialization, and defense construction to enlist the people in the project of rebuilding the Republic. Where private enterprise shies away, the people will step in, and the government will reward them for their labor."
 NIK_authdem_expand_rural_opportunities_desc:0 "A key characteristic of 'modern' society is the productivity of its agricultural sector, with machines doing the work of a hundred field hands in half the time. This is not to say that we disparage the work of the honest farmer; far from it! Most Russian farmers live hand-to-mouth, with antiquated tools and outdated machinery forcing a reliance on manual labor - oftentimes their own children, the future of our nation. We must invest in the means of agricultural production, subsidizing access to new technologies and labor-saving contraptions to improve productivity, ensure farming profitability, and give hope to farmers that they are working towards a brighter future."
 NIK_authdem_stimulate_local_businesses_desc:0 "While our detractors often charge that the PSD cares little for private industry in favor of a state-owned economy, nothing could be further from the truth. We recognize that we are not infallible or all-knowing. Private enterprise will always be more effective at identifying and meeting economic needs at the local level, far removed from the specific needs of the state in defense, infrastructure, and natural resources. We do not seek to control every aspect of economic life in the Republic; indeed, we encourage the people to embrace the spirit of competition, to have a vested interest in their own prosperity. In this regard, all the state should do is create incentives for the Republic's entrepreneurs to invest in the economy, and to provide access to capital for those who seek to start a business of their own."
 NIK_authdem_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "Every section of Russian society has been impacted by the long war, but none more cruelly so than its children. The new generation knows nothing other than poverty, danger, and upheaval. Even such a simple luxury as an education like their parents had is unattainable. The decline in educational levels is a slow-moving crisis that, if it goes unsolved, will cause a serious shortage of skilled workers in the years to come.\n\nBuilding, funding, and improving schools across the Republic is both the ethical and economical solution. It fulfills national development goals while increasing opportunities for millions. Nothing will signify Russia's slow but sure return to normality more than the masses of children filling classrooms for the first time in a generation."
 NIK_authdem_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "As we embark on our mission to improve education, one sore issue sticks out immediately: curricula and educational standards vary enormously between schools across the Republic, as distance, inequality of resources, and a lack of communication between localities drive them further apart. Schools that do not adequately educate their students are scarcely better than schools at all, and the potential is great for a wide skill gap to develop between various regions of the country.\n\nMany of these problems stem from the lack of a widely penetrating central bureaucracy. The government can do a far better job at setting and enforcing standards than the disparate array of local educational arrangements that exist currently, and it must if the Republic's less advantaged children are to get a better lot in life."
 NIK_authdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc:0 "Rebuilding a country is the tireless endeavour of an enormous number of skilled workers, engineers chief among them. Without them, it would be impossible to erect bridges, lay down vast lengths of road, design military vehicles, or perform any other of the staggering variety of tasks necessary to keep a society running. However, engineers are of short supply in Russia, owing to a general diminishment in educational capacity, and there are far too few to satisfy the exponentially growing demand.\n\nIncreasing attendance in engineering programs is not just a matter of economics: it is a matter of national security. Through subsidies to private schools and the establishment of new public technical schools, the government can encourage the formation of a new generation of bright young engineers who will take their country to tremendous heights."

 NIK_kosygin_springtime_in_russia_desc:0 "The people of the Republic have spoken; SMR, standing for liberty, economic freedom and a government of common sense, has been elected. Our mandate has been given to us freely and fairly through majority, rather than through the shady politicking of the old Komi Republic.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated President Kosygin has announced his intention to move ahead at once. Now that we no longer have to worry about the threat of paramilitaries, the business of governance can be carried out as it would be in any modern democracy. The long winter of discontent has ended, and freedom blooms anew from the soil of the Motherland."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_democracy_desc:0 "The cornerstone of democratic success is majority rule. Though both reactionaries and far-left vanguardists deride this idea as 'mob rule', there is no more clear a survey of the people's desires than a free and open election. If a majority freely supports us, then the radicals have no grounds for their claims of 'elitism' so often lobbed at liberal democrats.\n\nThat the majority of voters reside in urban areas, the core support bases for liberal ideals, is irrelevant. Our popularity is perfectly natural, and we need no dirty tricks to explain our success. The notion that the votes of our support base are inherently of low value due to their sheer numbers is mere jealousy on the part of labor and conservative politicians."
 NIK_kosygin_freedom_and_fairness_desc:0 "Though we always tried our best, the Komi Republic was never able to do right by its minorities. Even the eponymous Komi were often systematically denied a voice by racist elements of the Assembly. Now that western Russia is under our banner, we have entire republics of non-Russians!\n\nWe are happy to have our brother peoples living and working alongside us, but their republics are much younger and more fragile than ours. Unsavory types, such as Voznesensky, have a vested interest in suppressing their voters, and that's to say nothing of what radicals might get up to. President Kosygin has thus pledged to help build democratic institutions and carry out surveys of the minority republics, so that the interests of all citizens are fairly represented."
 NIK_kosygin_survey_republic_elections_desc:0 "When even a single voter is denied their fundamental rights, democracy suffers. It might not seem so at the time, but every step away from guaranteed universal suffrage is a step towards totalitarianism. For a proper democracy, this will not do.\n\nEveryone, from the most hard-done-by farmer to the wealthiest urbanite, is of equal value in the democratic process. Neither the elitism of the far-right nor the rabid classism of the far-left will benefit our republic. One citizen, one vote. With anything less, could we truly call ourselves a democracy?"
 NIK_kosygin_learn_from_past_mistakes_desc:0 "In truth, the Russia that we have begun to build here in the west is not the same nation extinguished by the Germans two decades ago. Nor is it the Provisional Republic, or the Empire. Our republic is something different; an entirely new nation, born amidst the graves of its parents.\n\nAppropriately, our vision for Russia must be forward-thinking and idealistic. Past Russian states had their virtues, but all ultimately failed for a single reason: they refused to change. There was always some rigid ideological line to toe, some utopian obligation that could never be fulfilled. Our republic will not make the same mistakes. We are trying something new, focusing on the practical needs of the present rather than a future that exists only in the dreams of ideologues, or a past that led Russia to destruction several times over."
 NIK_kosygin_towards_a_shining_future_desc:0 "It's never easy to move on. Russia has much to be proud of in its past, but there is just as much about our history that is sordid and shameful. There was always someone waiting in the wings to lead us astray, away from the path that would have best served the people. Russia has been disappointed by its leaders, time and time again. They always wanted the same thing: a Russia that was the overlord of Eurasia, tolerated no dissent and was feared by all the world.\n\nIt never worked. Fear always gave way to hate, dissent could never be silenced, and our neighbours never had cause to trust us. It's time to put away the dark dreams of Russia-that-was; time to embrace the future of freedom and peace that was denied her for so, so long."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_unity_desc:0 "The foundation of a successful democracy is cooperation. While it might be nice to imagine everyone sharing our ideals, that isn't how people work. The diversity of race, creed and class is mirrored in the diversity of thought within the minds of our citizens. The myopic approach of the Bolsheviks, assuming that everyone can be swayed to their 'perfect' ideology, must be dispensed with for the Republic to remain strong and free.\n\nTo demonstrate our good intentions, we shall enter into an alliance with one of the other major parties in the Assembly. Both command substantial support from the populace, and their support would strengthen our mandate. The question is: which? Which party will best suit our purposes: the rural, social-democratic PSD, or the labor-based democratic socialists of the DSNP?"
 NIK_kosygin_the_violet_platform_desc:0 "Despite being marred by Voznesensky's legacy, the DSNP still commands the respect and support of urban working-class voters. Though more directly inclined towards socialism than ourselves, they are just as committed as we are to democracy. Working with them will show the urban working class that we are still dedicated to advancing the interests of the proletariat, even if our take on socialism isn't quite what they might like.\n\nInformally dubbed the 'Violet Platform', our alliance will be based on a promise to more actively pursue socialism. The more rightist elements of SMR will not be pleased, but they'll come around eventually. We are still ultimately socialists, after all; it makes sense for us to join with the party that shares our end goals, even if our means differ."
 NIK_kosygin_for_the_worker_desc:0 "Hardline, anti-democratic socialists never understood what the working class really needed. All that talk of theory and uncompromising ideology... what good did it ever do the men and women who make a living on factory floors? A worker can't feed their family with populist ideals and workplace lectures!\n\nBoth SMR and the DSNP understand what the workers really want: a safe, productive work environment, one without harsh conditions or threats to life and limb. Better pay, better hours and better safety regulations will lead to healthier and more efficient workplaces. We will show the workers that one doesn't need to be a rabble-rousing demagogue to have their best interests at heart."
 NIK_kosygin_the_sovereign_coalition_desc:0 "The PSD has little in common with SMR; while they are ardently social-democratic, we remain committed to socialism. They find support amongst the rural populace and conservatives, while we appeal to urbane and progressive voters. Nevertheless, they are more trustworthy than the perpetually corrupt DSNP, and desire a strong Russia as much as we do.\n\nWe can work with these 'sovereignists'. Their policies of patriotism and Russian self-sufficiency might need to be tempered by cooler heads, but those aren't insurmountable obstacles. Some of their ideas have much to recommend about them; we will need a strong military to face Germany, and a certain measure of economic independence would protect us from negative economic developments around the world."
 NIK_kosygin_for_the_people_desc:0 "Understandably, SMR is generally leery of the military. It has often served as fertile ground for radicalism of both left- and right-wing varieties. Involving armed men in politics never ends well. That said, the PSD is correct in its assessment that Russia needs a stronger military to defend itself.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, we will show that we are willing to set aside our prejudices and experiment with the ideas of fellow democrats. Progressivism and pragmatism are not inherently in conflict with one another, and our technocratic ideas might find some appeal amongst high command. With the PSD's backing, we will begin a review into how we can improve the technological capabilities of the military and maintain its professional standards."
 NIK_kosygin_a_show_of_cooperation_desc:0 "Even if it's not a formal coalition government, we have shown our commitment to democracy by cooperating with another political party. Some of our hardliners are yet to stop sulking and publicly give their blessing to this endeavour, but that doesn't matter. This exercise in goodwill has been a resounding success - none can question that fact.\n\nSome critics have derided both parties involved, dismissing the joint effort as a token gesture. They don't understand that democracy is more complicated than they make it out to be. There are always negotiations to undertake, compromises to be made. Yes, the fascists and communists might not have to worry about petty disagreements - but our freedom and happiness is more than worth that trifling cost."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_reform_desc:0 "'Russia' and 'reform' are, sadly, two words that have never gone well together. Historically, reform has been hated both for going too far and for not going far enough. Foreigners have often observed that most Russians would rather indulge in murder than allow peaceful reform to occur under any circumstances.\n\nWe must agree somewhat. Reform is all about compromise and gradual change; it offends both ends of the political spectrum and provides a ready target for rabble-rousers. Nevertheless, we must press forth in line with our principles. The people have shown their maturity and commitment to reform by electing SMR - we must not disappoint them. Cultural and social reform are both on the table and ready to be presented to the Assembly."
 NIK_kosygin_assist_the_republics_desc:0 "Neither the Empire nor the Bolsheviks ever showed much interest in improving the nation as a whole. For them, Russia only needed investment in a few key areas, usually whatever was relevant to the latest propagandized attempt to play catch-up with the West. The notion of wide-reaching progress was entirely lost on them.\n\nTo correct our course and become a truly modern state, we must take a more holistic approach to national wellbeing. We are not a top-down state ruling by decree, but a union of free and equal republics. None of our constituent republics, no matter their history or demographics, deserve to be left behind. So, the programs of modernization and urbanization employed in our heartlands will be shared with all our brother republics. The entire Russian family will be united in prosperity!"
 NIK_kosygin_cultural_exhibits_desc:0 "Russia is home to more than just Russians. Dozens of ethno-cultural groups make up our great nation, though the Russian supremacist attitudes of past governments have diminished that fact in the world's eyes. Even many Russian Slavs, steeped in their own culture, refuse to accept the diversity of our nation.\n\nTo protect the heritage of our many peoples, President Kosygin has proposed the establishment of the All-Russian Heritage Committee. Comprised of representatives from each republic, the ARHC will direct funding for museums, festivals, artwork commissions and so forth. When the world thinks 'Russian culture', they should think of more than just icons and domed churches."
 NIK_kosygin_protect_natural_beauty_desc:0 "The Motherland has not been treated well by her children. The Tsars might have been incompetent in economic matters, but at least they were incapable of ruining the countryside. The Bolsheviks, obsessed with rapid industrialization and maximizing economic output, were a different story. The failures of Bukharin's initiatives litter the Russian landscape; open-faced mines carved into hillsides, forests of smokestacks spewing soot skyward, rivers clogged with industrial runoff...\n\nIt's a sad sight, and one that no progressive nation should tolerate. If such practices continue, how long will it be until all of Russia looks like Kaukasien? Proper protections should be established before we progress any further with our industrialization and urbanization programs. Though industrialists and state industries alike will balk at stifling of their expansion, it is a measure necessary for future generations to enjoy Russia as it should be."
 NIK_kosygin_uplift_minority_rights_desc:0 "Russia's national character is unfortunately tainted by its tendency towards chauvinism and homogeneity. Minorities of all stripes have been mistreated for centuries; first by royalty, then by revolutionaries. It seems that without intervention, Russia is doomed to remain stuck in its backwards, hateful ways.\n\nWe can't get rid of racism overnight, but we can make some important first steps. First, and most importantly: racial discrimination and hate speech must be outlawed, so that everyone can live lives free of fear. Second: the autonomy of minority republics must be permanently enshrined in the constitution. That is the only way to guarantee that a chauvinist government will never again trample on the rights of minorities."
 NIK_kosygin_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Progress has never been a popular idea in Russia. It has always been affiliated with the things that many people dislike: change, diversity, foreign influence. People fear what they don't understand - and the Russian people are particularly short on understanding.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. People can learn, change their ways, open their minds; but it cannot be forced upon them. That is what traditional socialists always failed to understand. Some measure of top-down change is necessary, but the transformation of society they sought could never be forced upon an unwilling populace. Perhaps it will take a century to achieve our ideal. Maybe more. But no matter what comes, no matter what future generations choose, we have done the right thing, and given hope to a generation born with none of it."
 
 NIK_socdem_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "The current economy is in a terribly bad shape. Much of what we once had was ravaged by German bombings twenty years ago, and the rest was destroyed by the Russian warlords before us. We will have to start a long recovery process if we are ever going to reestablish Russia as a dominant Socialist nation. Thankfully, our economic advisers are already formulating a plan to get us back on track."
 NIK_socdem_public_sector_investments_desc:0 "The public sector of any economy includes infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, public education, and other important services. Through this sector, we handle the essential services that every citizen in the Komi Republic may use (provided they pay taxes). Arguably, the public sector benefits everyone, and it is why we should put an emphasis on this part of the economy."
 NIK_socdem_lessons_from_the_reds_desc:0 "Several of our economic advisers believe that Lenin was once going in the right direction when he issued the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy in the 1920s. The Bukharinists shared the same ideas regarding a private sector-based development that would feed into a strong state-driven economy. Today, in the Komi Republic, we have decided to try the "capitalist turning into socialist" economic strategy and see how well it works. It could be that the Reds were correct in which policies work best for Russia."
 NIK_socdem_our_own_gosplan_desc:0 "When the Russian worker state was first established in 1921, the Soviets developed a Gosplan to handle the central economic planning of the young nation. The agency would maintain the Soviet economy until the Union's collapse in the face of Nazi Germany. We must develop our own Gosplan-esque agency to grow the young Republican economy. It must have the authority to coordinate both the state industrial development and our public works projects."
 NIK_socdem_rights_for_the_worker_desc:0 "We have seen throughout history the oppression that everyday workers faced. From Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages-style serfdom to the grueling Industrial Revolution, common workers were just tools that were exploited by the middle and high classes. The Komi Republic has no need for this type of ruthless exploitation; workers' rights were an essential part of the NSDP's campaign, and they will remain our highest priority. When we develop and enforce our policies, we put the workers above everyone else, as they are the collective Atlas that holds this Earth in place."
 NIK_socdem_the_national_resource_directorate_desc:0 "Here in Komi we have an abundance of different natural resources, but we cannot afford to use up all of them carelessly. We must develop an agency, the National Resource Directorate, to keep track of our natural resource supply and monitor its use. We can ensure that the resources will only be used to enrich the state and if they cannot be used, they will be carefully preserved."
 NIK_socdem_expand_the_key_facilities_desc:0 "Our large industrial facilities are precious to us; they often provide all of the manufacturing necessary to keep our economy running and our citizens working. We must work on expanding the large facilities we currently have, especially the industry in Izhevsk and Gorky. With improved factories and more jobs for our workers, our economy will certainly be strengthened."
 NIK_socdem_the_public_works_boom_desc:0 "Our careful policies have transformed a weakened economy into a quickly-developing one, with a strong base for additional improvement. It is safe to say that our economy is now one of Russia's finest, and it is all thanks to our public spending and infrastructure building. We must remember to thank our patriotic workers who have allowed us to establish this great socialist society, and it is through their craft that we are able to live prosperous lives in the Komi Republic."
 NIK_socdem_private_sector_supplements_desc:0 "Our plan for a total economic recovery starts with developing a private sector so that our people can actively run businesses and generate a profit. Right now, we need an economic system that can work for the individual citizens of our country. If the private sector plan succeeds, we will have a stronger economic base that can transition smoothly into the socialist state we desire. The development towards socialism begins with a capitalist base, after all."
 NIK_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc:0 "One method we can use to spark our economy is inviting foreign enterprises into our country and permitting them to build factories. These factories will generate a profit for us and a profit for our network of partner companies. All we have to do is reach out to some of these large businesses and convince them to bring their manufacturing plants to Russia."
 NIK_socdem_stimulate_local_economies_desc:0 "This economic plan requires the people to be the main source of income for the country. We can give jobs to our citizens by creating local building projects across the Republic, boosting the smaller economies. Once we raise the national standard of living and disperse wealth throughout, our socialist system will be able to manifest under our guiding hand."
 NIK_socdem_regulations_against_exploitation_desc:0 "When the general public is given power, it is our responsibility to ensure everyone is safe. Ever since we created the private sector, many privately-owned businesses have spawned, each with their own unique treatment of workers. More often than not, these businesses abuse the workers for their own corrupt personal gain, and it is time we put a stop to this cruelty. We must create nationwide safety regulations to ensure our workers are not exploited, and any private business that fails to adopt these regulations will be punished severely."
 NIK_socdem_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 NIK_socdem_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 NIK_socdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc:0 "Russia has been destroyed by countless years of war and bombings. To rebuild it, we will need more engineers than ever before. Civil Engineers from all across the nation must be called to serve in new, large projects of building bridges, railways, and roads. Cities must be improved to support the health of the people and ensure services are met.\n\nUnfortunantly, the current amount of engineers just won't cut it. If we want more engineers, we must teach more engineers. Universities will be persuaded to hold even more classes in Civil Engineering as well as helping bring additional people into the field. Soon, Russian cities will look even better than they did before all the bombings! "

 NIK_kosygin_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "There is nothing much to recommend about the Russian economy, such as it is. We have plenty of natural resources and a large population, but lack the means to take advantage of them. What little industry we inherited from the Soviets is variously outdated, run-down or just plain broken. That's to say nothing of our complete lack of international trade, a staple of modern economics.\n\nThankfully, President Kosygin is an old hand at this sort of thing and knows just the people to help draft a plan for the new economy. It won't be easy; even the fundamentals of our economy are lacking and many crucial sectors are non-existent. We're starting from nothing - but perhaps that will be for the best. Better to be free of old burdens entirely than bear their expenses."
 NIK_kosygin_establish_the_economic_zones_desc:0 "The finer details of economic recovery are for aspiring entrepreneurs and workers to manage. Free enterprise will take care of the groundwork. The state's role, meanwhile, must be to direct development in the most efficient direction possible.\n\nTo that end, our territory will be divided up into economic zones: regions where the economy will be organized by the government along the necessary lines. This way, we can avoid situations where prime agricultural land is given over to industry, or areas rich in resources are allocated to farmers."
 NIK_kosygin_the_contract_responsiblity_system_desc:0 "Every past Russian government has attempted to achieve agricultural efficiency, but none ever met with success. The feudal nature of the Empire meant that any proposed reform would have to wrangle the indolent, greedy landowners. The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, cared more about having an ideologically acceptable system than a fair or functioning one. This has made famine a recurring and severe threat to our people.\n\nThe 'Contract Responsibility System' will ensure a stable food supply and good income for rural populations by giving parcels of land to groups of farmers. This will minimize competition over land. Additionally, we will accept taxation in grain and subsidize their other crops."
 NIK_kosygin_aid_for_the_farmers_desc:0 "The current generation of Russian farmers have been building up their livelihoods from nothing. Mechanization was never a priority for the Bolsheviks, and the short-lived war economy only made their situation worse. Most farmers still work the land in the same manner as countless generations of peasants did.\n\nTo feed a growing population, our agricultural capacity needs to catch up with the modern world. For that to happen, every farmer will need the tools and equipment to match his American or Japanese counterpart. Though some economics chafe at the thought, we will have to instate massive discounts to make this possible - not an easy solution, but a smart one in the long-term."
 NIK_kosygin_open_the_republic_desc:0 "Russia is a land of bounty, but it doesn't have everything we need. More specifically: it doesn't have capital. Most of what little wealth exists is in the hands of governments, bar a few particularly miserly individuals. With our nation in the state it's in now, there is only one place for us to turn.\n\nForeign capital must flow into the country. With it will come knowledge, innovation and technology. All three will improve our economy with alacrity, given the disparity in development. It will be a long time before we can break through the glass ceiling and into the upper echelon of global economic powers, but catching up will suffice for now."
 NIK_kosygin_the_developmental_industry_sector_desc:0 "Naturally, industrialization will be a priority for us. The great nations of the world moved on from agrarianism decades if not centuries ago. Attempts were made by past governments, but the scale of industry found in Germany or Britain was never replicated here.\n\nBy offering to establish production facilities catering to foreign markets, we can become a workshop of the world. Given the less developed state of Russia, goods can be produced here at low cost compared to, for example, the United States. Basic goods from Russia exported en masse might not be glamorous, but if it works, it works."
 NIK_kosygin_exploit_southern_oil_reserves_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of nations and the foundation of many economies. Our reserves might not be as vast as those of Venezuela or the Arab nations, but we have plenty to fuel our own economic growth. We have enough, in fact, that exports are a viable option. No doubt some nations will be grateful to have a source that isn't in the pocket of an existing superpower.\n\nReserves already exist in Samara, the Urals and Tatarstan - a decent start, but we will need to drill deeper to find enough for a prospering oil industry. Expansion of existing facilities is a given; we can also look into more opportunities as we expand into Siberia. Just beyond our borders, there could be enough oil to make us a top competitor in the energy business!"
 NIK_kosygin_comprehensive_refinement_program_desc:0 "Exporting crude oil is good business, but it could be better. Because it's refined overseas, we're missing out on a large portion of the profits from the finished product. It would be a lot more profitable to refine our oil here in Russia before exporting a usable product. We might sell a little less, but the overall profits will be much higher.\n\nWith those increased profits, we can follow the lead of the Arabs and begin massive investment programs to bring our nation into the modern era. It's a seller's market, and we're selling at very affordable prices. Black gold will succeed where real gold cannot, and with it we will buy our way to the future."
 NIK_kosygin_foreign_investment_incentives_desc:0 "Some ardently patriotic types argue against it, but one cannot deny the efficacy of foreign investment. Granted, it tends to be the government rather than the citizens who benefit financially - but does that really matter right now? We should take any opportunity to further our economic growth, no matter whether it offends the ideologues and a few proud politicians.\n\nLabor incentives and tax breaks are all one usually needs to get foreign investors interested. We will offer both to corporations who open branch offices in Western Russia, as well as those who partner with Russian companies. It worked for the rest of the world; it can work for us, too!"
 NIK_kosygin_project_kibersin_desc:0 "The field of computing has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. Our resident computer scientists were stunned to learn what kind of advances have been made by the great powers. There has even been some discussion of the possibility that computers will be used in virtually every profession in a few decades!\n\nPresident Kosygin is most interested, and has gathered the Republic's small clique of computer scientists in the capital. Together, they have devised Project Kibersin: an astoundingly ambitious yet quite achievable plan to revolutionize the economy. This will involve establishing computer hubs, placed in key locations around the country. Able to process information at lightning speed, they will provide us with the most centralized and efficiently-managed economy in the world - at least, once we have the technology..."
 NIK_kosygin_managerial_socialism_desc:0 "Our free-market reforms and move away from the Bolsheviks should not be misinterpreted. The President is still, in his heart, a socialist. However, while we might aspire to socialist ideals, we are not blinded by ambition or ideological fanaticism. Socialism cannot be forced; it must be born naturally, coaxed gently into being with the consent of voters.\n\nTo this end, we have adopted the principle of 'Managerial Socialism'. Our economy will be regulated and structured in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of liberal capitalism while still enjoying its benefits. Eventually - so the thinking goes - it will progress into a state wherein a peaceful transition to true socialism will occur naturally, without the need for bloodshed and tyranny."
 NIK_kosygin_for_our_prosperity_desc:0 "Poverty is the bane of all nations. As the wealth and wellbeing of the people diminishes, so too does their homeland. Russia could build cities of gleaming spires, establish a space program and become the world's largest nuclear power. Yet, none of those things would elevate the poor from the gutter and give them the happiness they deserve.\n\nWe shall attack poverty directly and decisively, the better to end its tyranny. This is not a battle that can be won overnight, but future victory can be secured right now. What keeps people in poverty is the need to live on a knife's edge; that can be allayed with a proper safety net. When the poor no longer need to worry about affording their next meal or keeping a roof over their heads, they can become productive citizens and help lift themselves out of deprivation and despair."
 NIK_kosygin_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 NIK_kosygin_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 NIK_kosygin_unity_in_science_desc:0 "Science is the way to the future, but our progress in that direction has been halted. The rest of the world has moved on, while we, the Russians, are still working with textbooks from the early Soviet era. This problem is easily remedied, but how to get ordinary people invested in this 'boring' subject?\n\nWhy, propaganda! Propaganda is a dirty word these days, but how else can a government effectively convey its ideals and intentions? It doesn't have to mean brainwashing and 24-hour broadcasts; we can campaign for science through TV, radio and newspapers as we would if we were recruiting for the military. The lessons learned from stoking patriotic pride can be applied well in the popularization of science."
 NIK_kosygin_a_bright_generation_desc:0 "President Kosygin is said by some to desire nothing more or less than to be at the head of a grand bureaucratic machine. They say that he cares only for the sense of satisfaction he feels at knowing his grand design is functioning smoothly. They are wrong.\n\nThe greatest and noblest of the President's desires is to leave Russia in a better state than he found it. The best way to ensure that happens is to give all of Russia's children the twin gifts of education and safety. In time, it will fall to them to continue what we have started. Russia's future lives and dies in the hearts of these future workers and intellectuals - in the generation that will shine brightest of all."

 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_army_desc:0 "Our brave men in the field have accomplished a lot for us, yes, but we need to start bringing the Russian Republican Army to contemporary standards. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all have top-notch militaries, and it is likely due to advanced tactics and modern weapons, neither of which we currently have. In order to restore Russian prestige, we must work to modernize the army and join the ranks of the global superpowers in terms of military might."
 NIK_democratic_lessons_from_the_last_war_desc:0 "Our most recent conflict, the West Russian War, was full of genius tactics and offensives issued by commanders on both sides. We must look back on what worked for us in that war, how we carried out combat and used logistics to conquer our enemy. We can't neglect our opponent's strategy to win the war either, as his forces often fought to the very end. We must adapt these tactics to our current military in order to grow stronger."
 NIK_democratic_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "To improve our military strategy, we need to look to the top armies of the world: Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must observe the swift German blitzkrieg across Europe, Japan's burning advance into China, America's brave defense of Scotland. Even the South African War had plenty of cunning tactics from both the United States and the German Reich, and they were carried out with the newest weapons available. Sometimes, foreign military strategies are the most useful."
 NIK_democratic_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "It was not long ago when Russia was still fractured into various warlord states, each with their own dreams and aspirations of unifying the Motherland. In some regions, chaos remains widespread; it was only through our military that we became the strong force we are today. There are many lessons that can be learned from the Unification Wars, including the tactics used to defeat insurgents and the military strategies behind the most successful warlords here in Russia."
 NIK_democratic_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "Sometimes, our grand battle plans may be disrupted by unexpected, uncontrolled events; we cannot expect every war to be carried out perfectly. Instead of relying on one large battle plan, we should start focusing more on officer initiative: letting the individual commanders make the call based on the unique conditions around them. Because our overall command structures may break down, we might need to delegate the decision-making to the individual units on the ground. We must let each respective unit use the tactics that are best suited for their respective situation to win us the war."
 NIK_democratic_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Though our Russian Republican Army is mighty within Russia, it does not compare to the contemporary forces of the three global superpowers. Many of our tactics and weapons are from the German-Soviet War over twenty years ago; it is time to bring the RRA to the modern age. We will renovate the army by increasing the military budget, investing in new military technologies, and exploring the most recent military tactics. In the end, the Russian Republican Army will become a Cold War-ready force to be reckoned with."
 NIK_democratic_the_ministry_of_defense_desc:0 "In the process of upgrading our military, it is imperative that we expand our General Staff to meet the new army standards. We will have to provide our generals with updated data from battlefields around the world and keep them informed about the latest military training methods. We must also streamline the Ministry of Defense bureaucracy in order to improve the effectiveness of our leading commanders."
 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_navy_desc:0 "Many years have passed since Russia had a navy she could be proud of. Over twenty years ago, the Kriegsmarine ravaged the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea during the Second World War. The time has come for us to establish a naval force like no other, one that will prove capable of destroying enemies at sea long before they reach land. We will start by expanding our shipyards, recruiting the best available sailors in Russia, and constructing the most up-to-date vessels."
 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_air_force_desc:0 "One of the most valuable lessons the world learned from the devastating Second World War was the importance of air superiority and close air support of ground troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Air Force could not compete with the Luftwaffe twenty years ago; Soviet planes were often out-of-date, and pilots did not have sufficient training. We shall create a proper air force for Komi by building more air bases, recruiting top-of-the-line pilots, researching the latest models for fighters and bombers, and constructing powerful airplanes to wrest control of the skies and rain death on enemy cities."
 NIK_democratic_infantry_equipment_trials_desc:0 "Our soldiers require high-quality guns for use in the field, and unfortunately, all we have are World War II-era rifles and whatever left over from Zlatoust's merchants. We must hold trials and competitions to develop a new standard infantry rifle that can be mass-produced for our men. Better guns means more of the enemy we can kill to win the war."
 NIK_democratic_improve_on_the_armored_corps_desc:0 "The only available tanks we have are from the Second World War, and they do not compete with the armored forces of Germany, Japan, and the United States. If we are to make a swift advance and blast our enemies to pieces, we need to improve the quality of our tanks significantly. We will hold trials to see who can produce the most effective armored tanks that we can use for the army. Hopefully, the end result will be a tank that can compete with that of our opponents."
 NIK_democratic_reopen_the_vyatka_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "The Tsarists of Russia once had a famous academy that was used to train new officers for the General Staff, and it is time that we revive the academy. It will be used to pump out the best-of-the-best generals for our army and improve the officer corps. With effort, it could become one of the top military academies in all of Russia."
 NIK_democratic_strategic_supremacy_desc:0 "When it comes to war, weapons are only as good as the person handling them. Offensive and defensive tactics are only as effective as the commander issuing them. We must strive for the greatest tacticians in all of Russia and defeat our enemies through superior tactics alone. At the end of the day, it is our military maneuvers that will set us above our fiercest opponents."
 
 NIK_democratic_onto_the_world_stage_desc:0 "Now that we have become a regional power, it is time that we start reaching out to nations beyond Russia. To achieve this, we need to establish a proper foreign ministry and hire diplomats that can fully express our intentions to the world. Since we have become a contender for unifying Russia, the world has taken notice of our Republic, and we need to make our first appearance on the world stage."
 NIK_democratic_open_the_gates_desc:0 "Back when we were a smaller power, much of our trade was confined to Russia only. As a current regional power, we need to start branching out to other nations beyond the Motherland, especially the democratic countries around the world. Now that we have some coastal territory in northern Russia, it would be beneficial for us to establish a merchant marine operating around the White Sea, protected by a few of our ships."
 NIK_democratic_the_last_democracies_of_europe_desc:0 "With the rapid expansion of ideologies like Fascism and Socialism, it has become increasingly important for democratic nations to band together during this time of crisis. Essentially, we need to reach out for any European democratic hand we can hold onto, and we must appeal for diplomatic relations with these rare countries. Together, we will form a continental bulwark against the evil threat of Authoritarian regimes."
 NIK_democratic_appeal_for_recognition_desc:0 "Even though we are a regional power in Russia, some countries still see us as "just another warlord state". Diplomatic recognition is the first big step in becoming a relevant world power, the defender of democracy we aspire to be. We must call upon nations like the USA, Iberia, England, and Italy, and convince them that we are a legitimate state and deserve diplomatic recognition."
 NIK_democratic_embassy_funding_desc:0 "Now that we have received diplomatic recognition from some major world powers, we need to establish official embassies in each country that recognizes us as a legitimate state. We will have to set aside part of our budget to maintain these embassies, but we will also enjoy full diplomatic relations with several leading nations. It is a small price to pay for a spot on the world stage."
 NIK_democratic_call_for_investment_desc:0 "Our treasury can only pay for so many of the projects we started to transform this country, and now is the time we look to foreign investment. Thankfully, we can negotiate a deal with the new countries that have recognized us. We can assure these countries that if they decide to invest in our Republic, our debts will be paid back tenfold, and every country involved will benefit."
 NIK_democratic_across_the_ocean_desc:0 "We already enjoy diplomacy with several European nations, but we must also look beyond our home continent for potential allies. Though North America is a distant continent, it serves as a pedestal for the last shining beacon of democracy left on Earth. We should seek to establish connections with Mexico, Canada, and the United States in order to gain more international recognition and more embassies on the Western side of the Atlantic."
 NIK_democratic_a_visit_to_washington_desc:0 "Ever since our democracy was first formed in the ashes of the Soviet Union, one of our biggest diplomatic goals was to someday meet the President of the United States and discuss the global defense of liberty. [NIK.GetLeader], our own President of the Republic, would like to establish a meeting with U.S. President [USA.GetLeader] in Washington. We will take any opportunity to meet the wonderful American people, and if the proposed summit goes well, it will be another diplomatic achievement we can cross off."
 NIK_democratic_apply_for_ofn_observer_desc:0 "Though our current diplomatic status with the OFN is quite limited, we could use some foreign aid to continue building up our country. Our democratic government located in the middle of ravaged Russia should be enough to convince the OFN officials to grant us status as a prospective partner nation. It may be the first step on the road to becoming a proper defender of democracy like our American brethren."

However, the party has also been a consistently divisive topic, as Voznesensky has proven to be a problematic figure at even the best of times.\n\nA newcomer, Alexander Yakovlev, wishes to change the party's troubled reputation.

This is no reason to grow complacent, however, as the other parties are already seeking to encroach upon our most important base of support.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev already has plans to tour the industrial centers of the nation, and to publicly shake hands with the most influential worker's councils of our cities. With the councils on our side, we may have an easier time organizing future campaigns. Most importantly, however, this show of good faith will restore the worker's confidence in our party, and once again solidify our voter base."

However, certain compromises in these ideals had to be made to ensure better cooperation with the coalition to stem the tide of radicalism. Now that the storm has passed, the time has come for a new platform to reaffirm our commitment to socialism.\n\nAlexander Yakovlev has given the party the green light to make public this new platform, which is far more radical than anything we have seen before. It calls for a renewed push towards a democratic transition towards socialism, as well as a strict adherence to radical worker's rights policies. Women's rights, which were always present but never really the main focus, have been reemphasized as part of the party's goals. These policies may be seen as a bold shift towards the far left, but Yakovlev is confident that this new direction will revitalize the party for years to come."

It was a call by those who would see democracy preserved from the radicals, by any means necessary. Some in our party argue that our purpose has been served. No longer do radicals threaten to steal our freedoms. Instead, the officials of the PSD argue that we must look outward. Effective immediately, the party's platform for the upcoming election will incorporate a strong, pro-unification message. How the nature of Russian legislation will be left largely in the hands of local politicians. The focus of the national government will be on a massive rearmament program, which will improve industry, infrastructure, and provide employment to hundreds of thousands of Russians.

Later, Vorishilov's West Russian Revolutionary Front tried to take it back, but the West Russian War and the Republic's independence led to the war's eventual failure.\n\nHowever, now we have an opportunity. While we can not invade the remnants of Moscowien right now, we can start to press the issue of the border to the general public. Troops will be sent to ensure the warlords who have emerged do not invade the Republic and Russian refugees are taken care of. We can not take back what is rightfully ours so long as our flank is exposed, but we certainly can make our case known that all of Russia, including Moscowien, is rightfully ours."

Naturally, a winning strategy will require a winning campaign, emphasizing issues that Russia's voters see as relevant to their own lives and choosing popular policies in response to them. But, as the question always is, what to choose?\n\nRussia as it stands is backwards, uneducated, and globally isolated. It has been so for decades, and voters no doubt want things to change. Here is where the SMR can present its recipe for the nation's recovery: expanded investment in education, free trade policy so capital can flow into Russia once again, and the construction of robust ties to the free world. May Russia's rise to global prominence mirror our rise in the polls."
 NIK_third_election_meet_with_the_youth:0 "Connect with the Intellectuals"
 NIK_third_election_meet_with_the_youth_desc:0 "The SMR's philosophy emphasizes the values of openness, humanism, and intellectual achievement. Unsurprisingly, this makes the middle classes and the intellectual elite natural bases for the party. Any successful campaign will involve mobilizing voters of higher status, whether material or educational, to the polls in order to beat the other parties' rabble, and voters don't simply turn out because of similar social class.\n\nThe SMR needs an effective infrastructure that can mobilize this base, and the best way of doing so is by meeting them where they are. Sending campaign officials to donors and universities will allow us to build the party's connections to voters just in time to shepherd them to the polls."

However, he still held onto obsolete ideals, elements of Russia's Soviet past; while his methods were liberal and democratic, his ends were socialist, even if they were less so than Voznesensky or the extreme left. This element of the SMR was already vestigial when Kosygin was in office, and it is now time to move on.\n\nThe new platform will invoke our earlier ideals of freedom, both in speech and in markets, and of sensible international cooperation, while quietly abandoning Kosygin's leftist sympathies.

 NIK_dsnp_socialism_for_the_people_desc:0 "Alexander Yakovlev is no stranger to ridicule - the majority of which, ironically, coming from those ostensibly most aligned with our policies. They accused us of some dreadful lacking for putting faith in the synthesis of Marx's theories and the market's temporary benefits.\n\nSerov believed we lack the vision to uplift Komi from its dilapidated state. Today Syktyvkar and its neighbor cities bustle with cars in the day and shine with electric lights at night.\n\nBukharina believed we lack the interest to provide for the people's needs. Today every worker and farmer in our payroll enjoys benefits that would foment jealousy in their counterparts outside Russia.\n\nSuslov believed we lack the strength to exert power over our immediate neighbors. Today the Free Republic's flag flies in every government building west of the Yenisei.\n\nThe conclusion is self-evident: we distinguish ourselves from naive fools by proving our naysayers wrong. As the Republic's generals and diplomats secure West Siberia for Russia's rightful government, their doubting voices have returned - the past years were strings of flukes, or so they claim. Surely Yakovlev can't enforce his wishful thinking onto another large swath of land and its peoples.\n\nFor the revolution's sake, we shall prove them wrong a fourth time."
 NIK_dsnp_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Yakovlev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with Syktyvkar's finest."
 NIK_dsnp_strengthen_the_social_economy_desc:0 "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 NIK_dsnp_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "Everyday, prospectors drill holes in the middle of nowhere (or rather, in the middle of West Siberia) and drench themselves in fountains of sticky black gold. Powering cars, factories and homes worldwide, Earth's ancient ichor is in high demand - and the Free Republic has fields worth ten hundred billion barrels of it underneath our feet. We would be fools not to exploit them for our benefit.\n\nThe National Assembly has hence approved a bill establishing Gazprom, a state-owned company that shall soon manage the particulars of exploiting quite possibly Earth's largest reserves of crude oil. Oil wells, pipelines, employees - whatever they need, we shall provide. The revenue they will generate will more than recompense our treasuries' losses a thousandfold."
 NIK_dsnp_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 NIK_dsnp_a_fruitful_reunification_desc:0 "With West Siberia's last warlord vanquished, the Free Republic now stretches from Gorky to the River Yenisei. It is tempting to make haste and immediately fulfill our preordained right to rule over all Russia, yet we must not stray from our primary mandate - that is, the betterment of the peoples whose lives we affect through the Assembly's laws.\n\nFor now, we shall expend much of the government's attention into integrating our new citizens into the liberties and comforts West Russia enjoys. Wanton conquest can wait until the Republic's citizens, old or new, live the fulfilling lives we have promised them."
 NIK_dsnp_staff_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Bureaucracy grows as the state does; should the latter grow twice its size overnight, then the former grows twice also. Both could be said for the Free Republic at present now that West Siberia is ours. Unfortunately, our sudden dearth of bureaucrats has led to issues in applying Syktyvkar's ordinances past the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn response, President Yakovlev has directed his advisors to recruit more bureaucrats not only from West Russia, but also from West Siberia. The pencil-pushers under our old adveraries' employ will be of great use to their new government soon."
 NIK_dsnp_answer_the_autonomy_question_desc:0 "Ethnic groups such as the Nenets and Selkups have inhabited northern Russia since before Yermak subjugated the Khanate of Sibir. Centuries of oppression under the Tsar followed, then decades under old Bukharin, until Barbarossa shattered the rusted grip that held their leashes. Pressing circumstances had up until now prevented us from doing more than granting autonomy to the enclaves that remain. Operative phrase: up until now.\n\nCertain members of the National Assembly have proposed legislation that, if passed, would turn the natives' autonomies into self-governing protectorates - independent nations in all but name. Whether or not it does pass will decide what place our Republic has for Russia's many non-Russians."
 NIK_dsnp_approaching_the_dawn_desc:0 "On the outskirts of Syktvkar, a farmer tests his new tractor in today's harvest. He reaped more wheat that day than in a month with his old sickle and trowel.\n\nIn Omsk, gray concrete bunkers explodingly give way to housing complexes with windows, curtains and balconies: features once dismissed for showing too much to enemies that can neither be seen nor grasped.\n\nIn Gorky, the morning air comes alive with searing heat, struck hammers and steelworkers' song. With the city fathers' leave, its sprawling assembly plants are now put to task building automobiles the common man can afford.\n\nSlowly but surely, leisurely but successfully - Russia steps out of perpetual dusk. We will feel sunlight's kiss again."
 NIK_dsnp_lessons_from_the_sibplan_desc:0 "History remembers Nikolai Bukharin as a man of many plans but scarce time. His vision for Russia and her proletariat died with Moscow during the Great Patriotic War, and so we can only speculate its specifics. Gosplan nevertheless gave some of it form in the days of NEP, namely Siberia's manmade transfiguration into an industrial powerhouse. The hence-named Siberia Plan's aftereffects lay in the winding railroads and teeming industrial zones dotting the region's halves.\n\nMuch of the megaproject's documents - blueprints, manifests, progress reports - has survived the Warlord Era's complications. We would do the Republic's economy today and tomorrow well by applying their lessons in raw material-rich yet industrially-poor regions like the Kazan."
 NIK_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_desc:0 "While specializing regions by the resources they possess does maximize their use to the national economy, it also unevenly distributes the state's wealth as a consequence. The end result thereof is a nation comprised of two parts: poverty-riddled cornucopias and towering islands of industrial growth. Who services which needs no elaboration.\n\nThus, the Yakovlev administration's economic advisors have drawn plans to build a network of cities, with their factories and skyscrapers, from Arkhangelsk to Zlatoust. Our results shall prove to the world that the Free Republic has no place for unequal societies."
 NIK_dsnp_a_hand_to_the_west_desc:0 "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 NIK_dsnp_flying_together_desc:0 "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World.

 NIK_smr_reforms_for_russia_desc:0 "West Siberia has fallen to the Free Republic. With the task our generals had accomplished, it is time for our economists to do their jobs bringing the Republic's bounty to the region.\n\nKonstantin Katushev lived through the Soviet Union's downfall, and then survived the political machinations of one of its many successors, fully believing in one fundamental truth: that reform once elevated old Russia into a superpower.\n\nAnd reform shall soon restore new Russia as one."
 NIK_smr_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Katushev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with Syktyvkar's finest."
 NIK_smr_expand_on_kibersin_desc:0 "Project KiberSin has been bearing fruit in Western Russia. The data received from the computers has proven invaluable in advancing our economy onto the world stage. However, currently our KiberSin infrastructure is limited to Western Russia, and we now have annexed a large amount of territory that is in desperate need of economic recovery programs.\n\nIn order to make the Western Siberian economy more efficient and more effective, our President has proposed for increased funding to be allocated to Project KiberSin, and for additional KiberSin offices to be constructed in key locations across Western Siberia. Our government has determined the cities of Tyumen, Omsk, Sverdlovsk, and Nizhny Tagil to be prime locations for these offices. Not only will these offices help open up much-needed job opportunities in these recently incorporated cities, but they are also the largest economies in Western Siberia, and therefore are most in need of Project KiberSin's optimization."
 NIK_smr_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. As such, our President has approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern, to be aided by Project KiberSin once it is further developed, in order to ensure that oil reaches its destination on time and in sufficient quantities. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 NIK_smr_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 NIK_smr_a_fruitful_reunification_desc:0 "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 NIK_smr_approach_the_siberian_liberals_desc:0 "Despite the recent integration of Western Siberia, the various administrations of the region have not disappeared. While some of the politicians are far too dangerous to allow into our democracy, especially considering the tumultuous history our Republic shares with extremists. However, some of these administrations are filled with sensible enough people.\n\nBoris Yeltsin, a politician from Sverdlovsk, has been a democratic advocate for some time now, and we welcome him and his colleagues with open arms. Similarly, the liberals of Zlatoust can be relied upon for political support. We shall be discussing with these factions, and we can use their recommendations for various bureaucratic positions in our new local governments. Of course, we shall also be ensuring that SMR politicians find their way into the most critical roles of these governments, to ensure these governments are ultimately aligned with our values."
 NIK_smr_reestablish_the_siberian_republics_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union made many mistakes, but we do not need to dismiss all of its decisions with the same broad brush. Specifically, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, which helped provide representation to the various minority groups within the Soviet Union. Western Siberia is home to many minorities, and our Republic should aspire to ensure these minorities receive the same level of equality and autonomy within our system as they possessed in the old Soviet system.\n\nOur President wishes to recreate these Siberian ASSRs, although modified to better fit our government's structure. With the Siberian Minority Representation & Autonomy Act, several Autonomous Republics will be carved out of Western Siberia, and staffed with various ethnic and religious minorities that require greater representation within our democratic system."
 NIK_smr_crafting_our_future_desc:0 "When Pyotr Alekseevich became Peter the Tsar, he inherited a backwater from his father Alexis and brother Fyodor. Its cities hearkened the Kievan Rus' in their antiquity and bucolia. Its laity lived almost to a man as illiterate peasants and serfs. Its nobles and generals ruled their fiefdoms like free boyars, rather than subjects of an Imperial Majesty. Lesser men would be tempted to leave the state of things be; after all, what use was there changing an unstoppable force's course?\n\nBut Peter proved himself above and beyond men as concept altogether. By his decrees were our greatest cities willed into existence. By his tutelage, the evolution of peasants into intellectuals, craftsmen, clergymen. And by his ironclad will, seditious subjects and rapacious rivals alike humbled before the twin-headed eagle. The emperor's passing completed Peter the Tsar's metamorphosis into Peter the Great: guiding light and model for all Russians, regardless of ideology.\n\nIt is his footsteps which we had followed yesterday, are following today, and will follow tomorrow. History repeats in cycles - and as sure as the world turns about itself, so too shall Russia repeat the reforms which blossom sun-kissed sunflowers from its all-encompassing wastelands."
 NIK_smr_expanding_university_funding_desc:0 "The quality of life in Russia is beginning to rise, and our economy is doing well. With increased prosperity comes increased demand for a skilled workforce, and to obtain these skilled people, we need to educate the people. Unfortunately, university-level education has not been a high-priority for Russians ever since it collapsed into anarchy. Our President shall be increasing the funding reserved for universities and higher education.\n\nIncreased university funding will also aid our research endeavors, replenish Russia's academic scene, and it is the next step in advancing our nation to the modern age. Russian thinkers shall once more share their knowledge with the world."
 NIK_smr_new_conservationism_desc:0 "A core part of Russia is her beautiful, unending nature. The Union of Young Reformers has always stood for protecting the environment, as it is humanity's duty to be the stewards of this earth. With Western Siberia's beautiful forest, tundra, and mountainous landscapes now under our control, we must ensure that these beautiful lands are not butchered by industrialists and the greedy. Of course, our mission is made more difficult by those who governed Western Siberia before us. Tyumen and Omsk, their environments decimated and polluted by the policies of Kaganovich and the Black League. We must clean up their mess, and protect what's left."
 NIK_smr_a_hand_to_the_west_desc:0 "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises. "
 NIK_smr_flying_together_desc:0 "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Katushev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 NIK_smr_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "Once upon a time, Konstantin Katushev's erstwhile allies would have scoffed at his vision opposite the Assembly's aisle. Their opinions no longer matter now - but for posterity's sake, he has had the last laugh.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Katushev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor.

 NIK_psd_the_sovereign_mandate_desc:0 "We just secured a new mandate spanning the entirety of Russia. We must use it to spread our fair democracy to our brethren in West Russia as well as our new residents in West Siberia. Our Republic must make itself worthy for public support and ensure a strong, sovereign Russia that is by the people, for the people. Only then can we unite with our rivals and stand against the Nazi menace."
 NIK_psd_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "Currently, one of our biggest problems lies in our infrastructure. Even though our predecessors treated this land well and gave it life, there is still much more we can do to build this country up. For now, we should focus on restoring infrastructure and improving our cities to develop a strong core.\n\nNot only will our land development allow troops to move faster, but it will keep our population well-fed, a quality that not many Russian warlords have for their people."
 NIK_psd_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc:0 "Our Republic currently suffers from internal strife within the general population. Our citizens often criticize our military expansion, which leads to conflict between civilians and the government. A new welfare program should both strengthen the Republic and quell the many disputes arising between our people and the administration."
 NIK_psd_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "Through our military conquests we have captured many sources of oil. We now have plenty of oil to sustain our military and provide a surplus to our citizens. It would be beneficial for us to create our very own oil and gas administration to manage the energy resources we have gathered. Through this, we could give a little extra power to the energy sector of our Republic."
 NIK_psd_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Our economy is in need of a sovereign wealth fund that can be used to properly develop Russia. We need to establish a central bank that can invest in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, anything to enhance our public finance. Having this kind of investment fund will pull us closer to the economic prosperity we need to produce a strong Russia and help our citizens live wealthy lives."
 NIK_psd_siberian_security_desc:0 "Our conquests in West Siberia not only gave us more resources to work with, but we also have more potential threats to handle. Political opponents still remain throughout the deserted region. We must make sure the residents of Siberia are held to the same nationwide standards as everyone else, while getting rid of the dreaded Tyumen and Black League terrorists. It is our job to ensure the Republic is safe from the domestic extremists."
 NIK_psd_the_association_registry_act_desc:0 "With an ever-growing population of Russians from across Eurasia, there is bound to be a few political dissenters here and there. We must make it clear that some of these ideologies will not be tolerated, as they are against the principles of human liberty. We should pass an act that requires all former members of the Communist Party and Black League to disclose their membership so that we know who these dissenters are. Any person who was once affiliated with either party and refused to disclose it will be arrested."
 NIK_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_desc:0 "We look to the East and find our newly acquired West Siberian region, a place where trade once reigned as Yevgeny Dragunov made a fortune selling his guns to the long-extinguished warlords. We could learn a few lessons from his government's former administration. We need to partner up with Zlatoust's former bureaucrats and businessmen to solidify our control of the region, while also scouting for people who are experienced in administrative positions."
 NIK_psd_extending_democracy_desc:0 "We have been growing powerful in our little corner of the world, and some in our administration even say we're approaching World Power status. It seems like our mission of spreading democracy to all of Russia is finally starting to pay dividends. Our people could always use a morale boost to get them working harder, encouraging them to go beyond the imaginary limits that once confined us to our portion of Russia. We all must work to bring the blessing of human liberty to the entirety of what was once the oppressive Soviet Union."
 NIK_psd_encourage_local_democracy_desc:0 "The federal government always seems to have the greatest concentration of power, but it is the local government where the people's voice is best heard. Local administrations are much better suited to tackle local problems than the federal government, so we should encourage the people to participate in their regional elections. The most important changes often come from elections at the lowest level of democracy."
 NIK_psd_a_framework_for_popular_involvement_desc:0 "We need to come up with a plan to secure our democratic ideals in case something unfortunate happens in the next elections. We will establish a framework for regional referendums to ensure that the public majority still supports our cause even if we somehow lose the next vote. That way, the PSD agenda will be diffused among the population where it could counteract a potential PSD loss in the elections."
 NIK_psd_further_ofn_ties_desc:0 "Many members of our government watched the rise of Fascist and Communist regimes with their own eyes, and we all watched chaos ravage what was left of the Soviet Union. Even today, we often witness the brutal oppression set forth by the Nazi Party and the Empire of Japan. Our democratic brothers in North America and Australia work to defend the fledgeling democracies around the world, and we want to join their ranks one day. To start, we need to extend more diplomatic overtures to the OFN and let them know of our intentions"
 NIK_psd_the_twin_eagles_desc:0 "Our relationship with the OFN has been rather minor, as they still view us as a smaller force within the vastness of decayed Russia. We must send our diplomats to attend meetings with OFN affiliates if we are ever going to increase our diplomatic status with the organization. It would also benefit us to invoke the National Sovereignty Act in order to gain an OFN defensive guarantee. Through these first maneuvers we will improve our relationship with the United States and, like two soaring eagles, we will fight to the death to ensure democracy for all the struggling people of the world."
 NIK_psd_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "In this term we have accomplished many of our goals, both foreign and domestic. We worked with our resource departments to improve the economy, we worked to shatter the authoritarian influence at home, and we worked to better our relationship with the OFN. One major goal remains: we must fight to bring all the Russian people together under a banner of freedom, of life, liberty, and prosperity. It is during this term that we will unite all of Russia against the wicked Nazi influence that demolished the identity of Russia long ago. It is time for the Free Republic to start her final offensive."

 NIK_stalina_the_reconstruction_of_russia_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government now controls all of western Russia, with the recent annexation of Western Siberia. However, Western Siberia is marred by terrorism and the aftermath of extremist regimes. Tyumen's Communist Party and the Black League need to be hunted down and exterminated. Once that is done, we can build a decent administration in the region, that will facilitate our eastern expansion. It will be hard work, but President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are used to hard work at this point."
 NIK_stalina_securing_the_peoples_faith_desc:0 "The people of Russia need something to trust, something to keep them safe, something to support. We need to show them that we are the party of strength, stability, and national pride. We need to secure the people's support, because without it Russia will surely fall to extremism. Therefore, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved increased production of propaganda, and bribing off every semi-important public figure we can find. Once the people are surrounded on all sides by praise, they will have no choice but to support the Reconstruction Government."
 NIK_stalina_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc:0 "With the Reconstruction Government facing some dissent from its populace regarding the ever-expanding military, and the lack of democracy in our government. To combat this, President Stalina has suggested the allocation of some funds to the expansion of our nation's social welfare. There are two advantages to this decision: It pleases the populace and gets them to stop protesting against our administration's structures and policies, and it strengthens the nation as a whole. It will solve our most pressing problem, and aid us in the long term. A wise course of action, although it will limit the size of our budget."
 NIK_stalina_escalate_the_national_defense_projects_desc:0 "President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have come to a decision: the national defense projects must be expanded. Large projects such as American-style highways, repairing damaged infrastructure, and other such plans will produce large numbers of jobs, combatting the unemployment problem within our nation. We shall also order the Russian states to expand their defense economies, lifting some of the strain of economic management from the central government. This will also hopefully soothe the populace, who had been growing somewhat discontent as of recent. These actions shall strengthen our nation and prepare the Motherland for what's to come."
 NIK_stalina_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. If we can harvest our own oil supply directly, we will be able to fuel our military at a much cheaper cost. As such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern in order to efficiently manage the oil industry and ensure the efficiency of the nation's energy sector. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 NIK_stalina_establish_the_russian_sovereign_welfare_fund_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government has a lot of plans for the Motherland. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to put these plans into action. However, the National Reconstruction Council has come up with a solution to this problem. With approval from President Stalina, the National Reconstruction Council has greenlit the creation of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund is a state-owned investment fund, the money coming from the nation's banking reserves and our annual revenue. The wealth from this entity will go directly to the Motherland and her people. This will allow us to fund the development of infrastructure and improve our citizens' lives in other, more direct ways. The Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund should be relatively risk-tolerant, so it also is a fairly safe decision. The National Reconstruction Council sees no reason to delay its creation."
 NIK_stalina_a_hand_towards_the_east_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government has reclaimed and integrated Western Siberia into the Republic, but our work there is not yet concluded. Lots of work will be needed to raise the region to our government's standards of development. Once we do that, the people of Western SIberia will be able to have the same confidence in our political institutions as the rest of our citizens.\n\nOf course, our work in Western Siberia will not be peaceful. Extremists from Tyumen's Communist Party and Omsk's Black League have continued to fight guerilla campaigns, attacking our soldiers and our civilians. These terrorists need to be hunted down and eliminated, for the safety of the Republic. The scars left by Western Siberia's extremists will heal with the passage of time."
 NIK_stalina_break_the_hidden_circles_desc:0 "While their regimes have fallen, the extremists continue to thrive in secret. Despite our best efforts, members of the Black League and the Communist Party have slipped through the cracks and infiltrated our state. The Background Disclosure Act requires all former members of either organization to disclose their past membership. This information will henceforth be made available to the public, so that they can't suppress the truth. Anyone who refuses to disclose their membership and is revealed to have been part of either extremist organization will be arrested, and charged with conspiracy."
 NIK_stalina_the_yekaterinburg_commission_desc:0 "Currently, our temporary military administrations in Western Siberia are both understaffed and under-prepared for governance. These temporary structures were supposed to be just that, temporary. However a lack of trusted bureaucrats led to our government struggling to form proper, permanent administrations.\n\nTo combat this, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved the formation of the Yekaterinburg Commission. This commission's duty will be to locate administrative candidates within Western Siberia and rehabilitate them. While these candidates and bureaucrats may have worked for extremist regimes, the Yekaterinburg Commission will determine which candidates can be expected to abandon their radical ideologies. Once enough positions can be filled, a proper administration will be established in Western Siberia."
 NIK_stalina_redefining_politics_desc:0 "It has become clear to our nation, that ideology is a corrupting force, radicalizing those who follow these ideals. Instead of simply weakening ideology, we should focus on prioritizing pragmatism in our governance. All of Russia needs to learn to push ideological conflict aside, and accept our shared values: Freedom, Sovereignty, and Pragmatism.\n\nPolitics should revolve around these shared values, and shift towards simply solving problems without considering how these problems fit into greater ideological frameworks. Politics at their core should be utilitarian and unbiased. The best way to destroy extremism is to instigate this cultural shift, and sway the people to our side.""
 NIK_stalina_the_toolbox_theory_desc:0 "As President Stalina continues on her quest to divorce politics from ideology, she has adopted the Toolbox Theory. The theory is very simple: politics and political processes are tools used to solve practical problems. Rational people do not throw out the toolbox and resort to extremism to solve problems, such behavior merely causes new problems to appear. Instead, the answer to all problems lies in our political institutions. All we need to do is use them properly, and use them wisely."
 NIK_stalina_a_foundation_for_the_future_desc:0 "Once the government is stable, extremism is destroyed, and the Motherland united, it will be time to dissolve the Reconstruction Government. In its place, free and democratic elections will commence, and we will have institutions in place to ensure this.\n\nThe elections will be modeled after the Komi Republic's system, the President elected directly via ranked-choice voting, while the Vice-President is appointed by the National Assembly after the elections. The unicameral legislature will have two-year election cycles, while the President shall be elected every every four years, and there will be no term limits for both the legislature and the Presidency. The Komi Republic's problem was its kow-towing to extremism, not its government structure."
 NIK_stalina_answer_the_eagles_cry_desc:0 "The key to Russia's future is the OFN, and they are going to be our most important partners as we prepare to unite the Motherland. As such, we need to attempt to obtain increased status within the OFN. This would allow us to attend meetings of OFN-affiliate nations, and acquiring a defensive guarantee. To acquire this guarantee, the National Sovereignty Act can be used as leverage, since the United States is always willing to work with those who provide them the economic incentives to do so. With America's guarantee, the Motherland's bright and prosperous future will be ensured."
 NIK_stalina_look_to_challenges_ahead_desc:0 "The Reconstruction has accomplished a great deal, and now Western Siberia is fully integrated into our Republic, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead that we must face. However, with the combined power of our strength and our principles, we can move forward. We can unite the Motherland. We can bring stability to her people. We can turn the Motherland into a titan, ready to avenge her humiliation, and liberate Moscow and her citizens. We can achieve all of this, and the Motherland will finally be free from the shackles that extremists placed upon her."
