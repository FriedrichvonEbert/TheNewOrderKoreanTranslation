USA_react_to_last_potus_desc:0 "The §xfiery§! spirit of the §MAmerican Dream§! within the people of the United States has been choked in the wake of the corruptive influences and scandals of the White House ever since former President §RRichard Nixon's§! actions came to light. Now, it is our duty to not only advance the United States past the hurdles we must overcome, but also it is our duty to repair the image of the Presidency in the modern day. With a new, stable administration running the show in Washington, and a whole new figure to take the helm captaining this Beacon of Liberty, it's time to cut away at some of the rougher parts of the Presidency, and make our position whole in these trying times. §ROur predecessor implemented several disagreeable and disunitive policies in his administration§! which shall only serve to break apart the American people further; therefore, §Gif we manage to scale back our forerunner's actions,§! and focus more upon the future, as well as the elections of the upcoming years, we may yet find ourselves called heroes by the American people."

USA_LBJReac_Naivety_Johnson:0 "The Naivety of Johnson"
USA_LBJReac_Naivety_Johnson_desc:0 "Since 1948, Lyndon Baines Johnson held the Senate Democrats and, later on, the Senate Republicans together. His words were what carried his party through the political tempests that sprung out of the Second World War -- but his words were final, and brooked no dissent. The Lion of the Senate demands fidelity as jealously as he protects his own, and the American people expected this habit to bring his so-called Great Society to fruition as he strutted into the White House.\n\nHow shocked they were when they saw only a naive mouse who had done nothing but hemorrhage the country's money for four whole years. Having lost confidence in his promises, they voted us in to undo his mistakes instead.\n\nBut enough of the Texan's misfortunes, smug we may be of our prescience. The economy bleeds and America calls upon us to stymie its flow. Let's get to work before more wounds are dealt"
USA_LBJReac_Already_Great:0 "America was Already Great"
USA_LBJReac_Already_Great_desc:0 "Join a Johnson rally in his campaign trail and one will leave it utterly convinced that America is beyond salvation. Bread leaves the table faster than it is set, men regard their fellow man less than the worms writhing beneath the soil we tread, and men of hate hold the reins of power without a care for the problems that plague their people. These rallies depict an America which only radical solutions -- coincidentally, Johnson's peddled solutions -- can save.\n\nThe disillusioned need only look beyond their hit pieces to disprove the flimsy scarecrows Johnson's arguments attack. Look at our bustling towns for standards of living unparalleled on Earth; look at the folks working our farms and storefronts for the friendliest strangers one can ever meet; look at the technocrats and statesmen steering our nation's course to warm, sunlit waters.\n\nDo not be fooled by the agendas of radicals; America has already been great. God willing, it will remain great in our hands."
USA_LBJReac_How_Many_Agencies:0 "How Many Agencies Do You Need?"
USA_LBJReac_How_Many_Agencies_desc:0 "HDCS, SSA, DCP, NEH, USDOT. CAP, VISTA, OEO, FSP, HUD... If the path to Hell were paved with good intentions, then Johnson must've thought the yellow brick road to his Great Society needed as many bricks stamped with alphabet soup agencies as possible.\n\nIn any case, the level of bureaucratic red tape needed to buttress even the bare minimum of his reforms is ridiculous to the point of satire... in a saner world, that is. Here it is merely hideously expensive, not to mention unconstitutional. Cutting funding for most of them will both solve part of our financial woes and uphold the law of the land at the same time."
USA_LBJReac_Slash_Budget:0 "Slash the Budgets"
USA_LBJReac_Slash_Budget_desc:0 "A large budget gives rise to large bureaucracies, which then necessitate a large budget, which then create even more bureaucracies and... well, one would understand the point made easily enough.\n\nJohnson, God of Olympus he must have thought himself as, had made the fittingly hubristic decision to expand both budget and bureaucracy during his term. Learned men would realize the natural consequence of such a foolish action; as token comfort, such learned men now take charge in restoring much-needed order to America's balance sheets.\n\nThe solution they offer is beautiful in its crude simplicity; cut both bureaucracy and budget by a certain percentage, and either will help the other shrink to more manageable levels."
USA_LBJReac_How_Far:0 "How Far Should We Go?"
USA_LBJReac_How_Far_desc:0 "By now we have plucked enough low-hanging fruit to slightly relieve America's budget of its angry-red deficit. Still not an ideal condition, by any means, but at least it now loses considerably less money than before the election. Now all that remains of Johnson's legacy are the programs which do enjoy the people's approval to some extent, Social Security the most notable among them.\n\nCongress is divided on how to proceed at this juncture; fiscal conservatives, in addition to our voter base, advocate dismantling these programs posthaste. Contrariwise, moderates from Johnson's own party argue that the benefits of keeping them around outweigh both their association to his name and the cost of their upkeep. For all its faults, they argue, the Great Society has a smattering of both well-intentioned and effective solutions for some of America's faults.\n\nWhich path shall we pursue?"
USA_LBJReac_Could_be_Usefull:0 "Save the Framework"
USA_LBJReac_Could_be_Usefull_desc:0 "It is a testament to either American pragmatism or American forgivingness that we can consider Johnson's ham-fisted reforms to be of some merit. Despite the money he had wasted as kids do with their lunch money on a candy store, the ex-President did manage to fund programs which have guaranteeably improved the American people's lot. Keeping them around ensures that the nation will continue eating the better morsels of Johnson's cake.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans will be less likely to throw a tantrum for taking away even more of the handouts they so irresponsibly promised. They have a reputation to uphold, after all."
USA_LBJReac_Targeted_Funding:0 "Targeted Funding"
USA_LBJReac_Targeted_Funding_desc:0 "Our hesitant acceptance of some of Johnson's reforms does not, however, automatically insinuate adopting the wanton spending we have campaigned against ever since his first hundred days. If we're to save some of his programs, then which to fund and how much to spend must be carefully considered. The budget hawks in Congress can only stomach so many exemptions before denouncing us for being too lenient on his disastrous budget -- and justifiably so.\n\nHence, the new budget's discretionary funds shall be earmarked only to those initiatives which have demonstrated overwhelming success, or at least a large benefit-cost ratio, in their intentions."
USA_LBJReac_Shrink_Safety_Net:0 "Shrink the Saftey Net"
USA_LBJReac_Shrink_Safety_Net_desc:0 "As it is, the federal government is neither wealthy enough to provide nor suited enough to assume a more active caretaker role over its citizens. Questions over moral responsibility and constitutionality aside, America cannot feasibly subsidize all of its citizens' lives from cradle to grave; to demand for such an impossibility is the height of naiveté, and listening to such voices will bring about the very failures that had sunk Johnson's presidency.\n\nOur country's safety net must be futureproofed from the temptation to further deprive funds from it for the sake of a balanced budget. Shrinking it from potentially unsustainable levels will achieve just that."
USA_LBJReac_Era_of_Big_G_is_over:0 "The Era of Big Government is Over"
USA_LBJReac_Era_of_Big_G_is_over_desc:0 "Johnson's greatest flaw, as with a good portion of his base, was in assuming that a large government equates to a more just and more prosperous society. As his final days in the White House has proven, large government brought only reckless spending to the American economy and pitiful gains for the American people. So do we approach the state of affairs after he left his office in disgrace: Decades of sure progress undone in four short years after unwavering obedience to one small lie.\n\nWe have acquired the consent of the governed only by promising to learn from the man's follies. Future administrations may ignore their heeding; for now, however, the venerable word of State and Congress trump the fickle whims of rabble-rousing Presidents."
USA_LBJReac_Shutter_Office:0 "Close the Office of Economic Opportunity"
USA_LBJReac_Shutter_Office_desc:0 "The Office of Economic Opportunity has turned out to be a step too far in LBJ's efforts to curb poverty in America. It is undermining the will to work, tramples on state's rights and... well, frankly, it's just too damn expensive. We can find better ways to end poverty instead of the government simply enforcing it."
USA_LBJReac_End_Social_Security:0 "Ending Social Security"
USA_LBJReac_End_Social_Security_desc:0 "It is safe to say that Johnson's legacy has now been fully undone. His programs have been repealed and the national budget freed from their burdensome expense. What remains of his Great Society has either been relegated to the history books or gutted so thoroughly that they fail to act even as cushy sinecures to gift to allies. Though time is needed so the fruits of sane spending can blossom, the government's money is no longer under threat from those that jeopardize its recovery from here on...\n\n...Except, a clique of conservatives say, for the Social Security Program. Johnson's crown jewel may be popular with the American people, but the fact remains that its foundations are shaky at best, and a fraud scheme at worst. There will inevitably arrive a time where the stream of young working men on whom Social Security relies can no longer keep pace with its dependents. A system of handouts with such a blatant point of failure has no place in a penny-wise economy; hence, they proclaim, Social Security must go."
USA_LBJReac_Rocked_Boat:0 "Settling the Rocked Boat"
USA_LBJReac_Rocked_Boat_desc:0 "Johnson had campaigned for a massive wave of civil rights legislation leading up to Election Day, without regard for the recklessness of promising too much within too short a time. Perhaps he genuinely thought radical action was necessary to heal the country's racial divides, or perhaps he saw it as a risky gamble to rally the Black Belt behind him and nothing more.\n\nIn any case, he ultimately failed in both accounts; Southern whites cried foul for doing too much to improve the black man's fortunes, and blacks nationwide expectedly felt betrayed that the President would pay so little of what he owed. In attempting to bind the nation's wounds, the Texan widened its gashes instead.\n\nThe situation as it stands can be compared to a rocket boat on a full-speed collision course with a rocky cliff. Our mandate demands that we rein it in before the nation crashes headlong into another avoidable crisis."
USA_LBJReac_Coddle_South:0 "Coddle the South"
USA_LBJReac_Coddle_South_desc:0 "Never has there been an opponent to civil rights legislation stronger or louder than George Wallace and his clique of erstwhile Dixiecrats. They cloak their disdain for the black man with alibis such as "protecting states' rights" and "defending the Southern way of life", all while their constituents eat the words they palm like famished swine.\n\nUnfortunately, Wallace's propensity to cause headaches for any administration grows with how little he believes his words are heard. As Senatorial gladiator fights are farthest from our agenda, we should at least make a show of treating his jeremiads with the consideration he expects. Lord knows how insufferable the Alabaman grandstander can be in the middle of his polemics..."
USA_LBJReac_Unshackle_Police:0 "Unshackle the Police"
USA_LBJReac_Unshackle_Police_desc:0 "In an attempt to prevent America's police forces from handing injustice to Afro-Americans, the Civil Rights Act's drafters had wrapped our officers with enough red tape to keep them from handing anything at all. What use are policemen so emburdened with onerous policies that they are effectively unable to enforce the law? Security theater of this sort does no one justice -- neither the blacks it claims to protect, nor the brave men who did swear an oath to protect them.\n\nIf we expect our cops to serve and protect, then freeing our police services from the fell clutches of such intrusive bureaucracy is a sine qua non. Any less remains a hindrance they are better served without."
USA_LBJReac_Question_Still_Stands:0 "The Question Still Stands"
USA_LBJReac_Question_Still_Stands_desc:0 "Thus far we have trimmed the Civil Rights Act's elephantine hide of its worst excesses; guidelines were revised, punishments adjusted, definitions clarified and processes streamlined. But trimming can only do so much to an issue that weighs a metric ton in the public discourse. It remains there by the corner whether we like it or not, waiting patiently for the final decision.\n\nWhat this final decision should be, as always, has one of two answers: Either back the CRA as it stands to the hilt, or consign it to the Congressional archives as failed legislation. Good Presidents exercise prudence at critical junctures in their term -- like this"
USA_LBJReac_Cant_Change_it_Now:0 "We Can't Change it Now"
USA_LBJReac_Cant_Change_it_Now_desc:0 "Though the South likes to pillory the Civil Rights Act as Lucifer's will made manifest, its specific articles... aren't. On the contrary, vast swathes of the American people would consider it an attestation of the jubilee they were promised. Its protections for them and theirs are miles beyond what they've had years prior; shunting these already-enforced legal defenses to placate the South's whites invite more trouble than it's worth.\n\nLeaving aside the good maintaining the Act's serviceable parts can do for America's racial divides, the fact of the matter is that the CRA is already in force. To circumvent the headaches that come with striking down a popular law in a blatant political attack, we should accept the Act as the binding law that it is."
USA_LBJReac_Enforce_the_Provisions:0 "Enforce the Provisions"
USA_LBJReac_Enforce_the_Provisions_desc:0 "Dura lex, sed lex -- the law is harsh, but it is the law. One cannot underestimate the import of this facet of the social contract in maintaining civilization; without the will to obey even undesirable laws, then societies will collapse out of enmity for legal codes which do not agree with everyone's preferences to the letter. Likewise, governments must show a willingness to uphold its own laws without prejudice for the same reasons.\n\nThis applies fittingly well to our own circumstances with the Civil Rights Act. Though we have our disagreements with some of its portions, it still stands uncontested as an integral part of American jurisprudence. We are thus obliged to enforce its decrees -- if not their spirit, then at least their letters."
USA_LBJReac_Dismiss_Lawsuits:0 "Dismiss the Lawsuits"
USA_LBJReac_Dismiss_Lawsuits_desc:0 "Lawsuits are time-honored weapons with a special place in the American man's armory. Where the knights and kings of old joust for the privilege to be seen as just, Americans instead invoke the court of law to outlast the other's money. Nevermind that your reasoning is invalid at best; so long as there are means, then one will have their long, not-so-speedy case under common law. Justice has been miscarried in such a manner many times before.\n\nIncidentally, an increasing number of lawsuits aimed at certain portions of the CRA have been recorded since Johnson's ratification thereof. If left unaddressed, these lawsuits may effectively repeal parcels of the CRA until it is de facto repealed completely. Fortunately, the Supreme Court's current Justices know better than to ignore and abet these naked attacks -- acquiring their direct assistance may end these lawsuits for good."
USA_LBJReac_Do_Whats_Right:0 "Do What's Right"
USA_LBJReac_Do_Whats_Right_desc:0 "We've labored hard to oppose it, promised millions that we will oppose it, acquired money by promising to oppose it, banded with strange bedfellows to oppose it, and so much more just to oppose it. Principles have been sacrificed and bargains were dealt to get us to where we are now.\n\nUpholding our end of the deal at this point in time may not be the easy thing to do... but it damn well is the right thing to do. Hence, we shall get rid of the Civil Rights Act by any means necessary."
USA_LBJReac_Pull_our_Support:0 "Pull Our Support"
USA_LBJReac_Pull_our_Support_desc:0 "Laws only matter to the extent with which they are enforced. Deprive a law of the government's full backing, and the people see it as law no longer. By determining which laws are enforced and which aren't, even laymen can figure out their own government's priorities without an overt declaration.\n\nWe can use this logic to signal to Congress and our base that the Civil Rights Act is no longer appreciated by our administration. Controversy must be avoided as much as possible; this approach mitigates the risk of such occurring by allowing us some degree of plausible deniability for those unaware or unwilling to read into our actions' implications."
USA_LBJReac_Quiet_Gutting:0 "Gut it Quietly"
USA_LBJReac_Quiet_Gutting_desc:0 "Dedicated we may be to repealing the Civil Rights Act, but we are not blind to the repercussions it may cause. America's black population, and their allies in Congress and state governments, will riot like nothing else if we so much as hint of a repeal. As official processes are all but barred under pain of political suicide, creative means to negate its repressive decrees have been considered.\n\nOne proposed option is to introduce seemingly separate laws and Executive Orders in the coming months, each repealing a small portion of the CRA. This would continue under the guise of the customary spree of legislation enacted in a newly-elected incumbent's first hundred days; by the time people realize what has happened, the Act's de facto repeal will be a fait accompli."
USA_LBJReac_Back_on_Track:0 "Back on Track"
USA_LBJReac_Back_on_Track_desc:0 "Years from now, history books will cover in detail Lyndon Johnson's meteoric rise and meteoritic fall from grace in American politics. They will talk of his accomplishments and failings. They will dissect and analyze his minute movements, foibles and mannerisms to understand his motivations, his drives and acts. They will hound his life for the happenings he had seen and the places he had been, to piece together and make sense of a timeline with a beginning and end; rising and falling actions; and tension and denouement. And they will still conclude that the good Senator from Texas had presided over a dismal Presidency whose crowning achievement is pushing the national debt to record highs.\n\nWhoever writes our story will see a contrast more striking than light and dark. Where Johnson had a death spiral for a budget, ours is a thunderbolt striking upwards. Where Johnson had a country torn in two colors, ours is one nation mended whole by the stitches of brotherhood and reconciliation. Where Johnson had left America approaching twilight, we continue guiding it towards rolling plains forever bathed in sunrise.\n\nIn time, history might redeem Lyndon Baines Johnson for his many failings. But by then America will have long known that [USA.GetLeader] had pulled her out of those failings and set her back into right and proper straits once more."

################################ Bennett Response

 WFB_Reponse_Revenue_Up:0 "§GThis will increase our revenues!§!\n"
 WFB.response.1.t:0 "Bennett's Folly"
WFB.response.1.desc:0 "We have inherited a rather unfortunate economic environment from the Bennett administration. A lot of important regulations were greatly loosened in the interests of economic growth, allowing businesses to take increasingly short-sighted actions all to chase just a little bit more money. Wealth has been shifted overseas to avoid taxation and jobs have been outsourced to foreign sweatshops, among other selfish practices.\n\nMany of our voters are not happy about this, and so the President means to undo a lot of the damage Bennett has caused. It might not be popular among the wealthy elite who benefitted from these policies, but for the decency of American capitalism and for the sake of working American people, it must be done. We have a lot of work to undo."
WFB.response.1.a:0 "Let's get business back in line."
WFB.response.2.t:0 "Closing the Loops"
WFB.response.2.desc: "There is a lot of money in banking, and yet for some, 'a lot' is not enough. For these individuals, many loopholes exist in our tax codes that allow them to pay much less than what they actually owe. While the Bennett administration did not help this matter, in truth this has been a problem for quite some time.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has ordered a formal review of tax codes across America that will hopefully close the majority of these loopholes. Certainly, the bankers will be incensed to learn that they now have to pay what they owe, but it is only fair and just that we ensure they do so."
WFB.response.2.a:0 "Pay up."
WFB.response.3.t:0 "The Supply Side Speaks Out"
WFB.response.3.desc: "Our efforts to end the policies of the Bennett administration have been received positively by working class voters. However, some prominent voices amongst the economists have spoken out against us. They claim that what we are doing will damage the competitiveness of the American economy, and in the long term it will hurt those we are trying to protect.\n\nThese words have resonated with some within our party, who have begun to argue that we are going too far. This may cause consternation within the party ranks - however, it is what the voters expect of us, and so we will have to push through if we wish to maintain our poll numbers."
WFB.response.3.a:0 "It's not efficient, it's right!"
WFB.response.4.t:0 "Money Talks"
WFB.response.4.desc: "It would seem that the powerful men and women whose wallets most benefited from President Bennett's policies have really not taken a liking to us. So much so, that they are now using their large wallets to attack us directly. Multiple publications in the last week have seen huge attack ads taken out against our government - the Wall Street Journal today came with an entire three page spread filled with numerous economic voices tearing our policies to shreds.\n\nWhile the people already opposed to big business are unlikely to care, this could prove problematic amongst more undecided voters. If this media blitz by the rich and powerful continues, it could sway many voters who see our actions as threatening to the economy - and their livelihoods - away from us."
WFB.response.4.a:0 "Damn it."
WFB.response.5.t:0 "For the American Worker"
WFB.response.5.desc: "President [Root.GetLeader] today took to the podium to speak about our rollback of Bennett-era policies. They made it clear that while they do understand the concerns of the economists and intend to keep America competitive on the world stage, that cannot come at the expense of injustice.\n\n"The American worker must be appreciated and respected," they insisted. "We cannot allow our economic goals to sideline the people we represent, and we will not throw away the people who make this country great. Economic efficiency must not come before the wellbeing of the people." It is hoped that their words to the public will convince the undecided that what we are doing is necessary."
WFB.response.5.a:0 "The President's words carry much weight."
WFB.response.6.t:0 "Free Trade isn't Free"
WFB.response.6.desc: "President Bennett placed a lot of focus on trade. In principle, this is a smart move, but in execution, much of what he did can only be described as disastrous. Our markets have been almost completely opened to the OFN and other nations, allowing foreign companies to move in with little to no cost and muscle out small American businesses.\n\nThis will not do. We cannot allow even our allies to take advantage of us like this. Therefore, we will focus our efforts on tearing up these unfair deals. Our trade status will be returned to status quo ante; our nations will have to pay the proper tariffs and duty if they wish to do business here. We will not allow Americans to be sidelined by foreign entrepreneurism.\n\nOur allies might not appreciate this, however."
WFB.response.6.a:0 "Time to slap on the tariffs!"
WFB.response.7.t:0 "Australia Objects"
WFB.response.7.desc: "The Australians have reacted with dismay to our new trade policy. They have made a fair amount of money in the last four years, and they are not keen to give these opportunities up. Pointing out that their steel exports are greatly relied upon by both the Australian and American economies, they have asked to be exempted from our new tariffs.\n\nWe have stated our intent to end the Bennett-era trade deals, and to back down now could be seen as weak. However, the Australians do have a point - steel is an important resource, and can we really afford to restrict its flow into our factories?"
WFB.response.7.a:0 "The Australians can be exempt."
WFB.response.7.b:0 "The Australians will pay tariffs."
WFB.response.8.t:0 "The OFN Objects"
WFB.response.8.desc: "As expected, many of our allies within the OFN are upset with our turn of policy. Many of their ambassadors have made unofficial statements of complaint already, and we can soon expect more concrete grievances laid at our feet. This is a tricky diplomatic situation, to say the least.\n\nProblems are brewing at home, too. In an uncommon show of commonality, the Democrats and many within the Far-Right have formed a tenuous united front, attacking us for making an 'unacceptable foreign policy blunder.' They are calling on us to be lenient on our allies and maintain at least some of the free trade agreements. If we are to move forward, we may need to find a balance in our policy, or else push straight down one path or the other."
WFB.response.8.a:0 "Disunity at home and abroad. Typical."
WFB.response.9.t:0 "Mexico Objects"
WFB.response.9.desc: "Though not part of the OFN, Mexico does have many economic links with us that were extended throughout the Bennett presidency. Predictably, Mexico is not happy with the prospect of losing out on lucrative trade agreements. They have asked for an exemption, pointing out the extensive grants of oil and mineral rights they offer to us and insisting that tariffs would be bad for both of us.\n\nAllowing Mexico continued free access across the border would run counter to our stated goals, but stifling our supplies of fuel and other commodities would certainly hamper us. Can we afford to cut ourselves off?"
WFB.response.9.a:0 "The Mexicans can be exempt."
WFB.response.9.b:0 "The Mexicans will pay tariffs."
WFB.response.10.t:0 "Canada Objects"
WFB.response.10.desc: "The Canadians have politely expressed their opposition to our tariff policy. As our closest neighbour and ally, they insist that we have a lot to gain by keeping free trade in place.Particularly, they are hoping that their lucrative lumber industry and other markets will not be impacted by our actions.\n\nA lot of northern towns and cities have come to rely on Canadian trade, and these communities may be hurt by our tariffs. However, we did promise a tougher hand on all foreign parties, even if they are our close friends. A decision must be made."
WFB.response.10.a:0 "The Canadians can be exempt."
WFB.response.10.b:0 "The Canadians will pay tariffs."
WFB.response.11.t:0 "A Fair Deal for All"
WFB.response.11.desc: "Our diplomats have put in a lot of work wrangling, wheeling and dealing with our trade partners, and we seem to have finally reached an understanding. We've put our foot down in some places while giving leeway in others, but our diplomatic approach seems to have achieved the best of both worlds. While some foreign business figures may grumble, our new deals will protect American workers and markets from foreign exploitation while still allowing trade to flow between our critical partners.\n\nWith the only formality remaining being the signing of the agreements, we can safely say that we have succeeded. The economic and diplomatic cost of our actions have been minimized, and we can look forward to a better, fairer, healthier trade relationship with the wider world."
WFB.response.11.a:0 "A great success!"
WFB.response.12.t:0 "Burning Bridges"
WFB.response.12.desc: "We have torn up the unfair trade agreements, and our base is certainly pleased. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our OFN partners, who can be best described as absolutely furious. Stocks in many markets fell sharply recently as the economic uncertainty set in, and some commentators have called our actions "greatly undermining to the spirit of the OFN."\n\nWe can hardly be blamed for the lax approach of the Bennett administration, and something needed to be done to get a fair deal for American people and American business. Yet as an increasingly chilly air sets over foreign embassies across the country, it can hardly be said that this was a diplomatic success. While this incident is far from the doom of the OFN, it has certainly put our relationships on ice."
WFB.response.12.a:0 "Fair dealings, at the price of friendship."
WFB.response.13.t:0 "The Free Trade Backflip"
WFB.response.13.desc: "In the interests of preserving our diplomatic and economic ties, we have had to back down on a lot of our talk of tariffs and renegotiation. Though we have successfully scored a few changes, the free trade culture of the Bennett administration remains mostly intact. Our allies thank us for this. Our base, on the other hand, most certainly does not.\n\nMany within our own party call us weak and impotent, "so readily caving in to foreign powers." Meanwhile, the Democrats seem quite pleased with the situation, with former president Bennett himself speaking up to praise our "wise move." This glowing commendation from our old opponent has not gone down well at all in the theatre of political discourse. While we have secured our diplomatic ties, our u-turn has clearly harmed our popularity at home."
WFB.response.13.a:0 "Lucrative dealings, at the cost of support."
WFB.response.14.t:0 "A Letter of Opposition"
WFB.response.14.desc: "A letter, signed by numerous senators from several different party factions, has made quite a stink both on Capitol Hill and in the news cycle. The letter pens a scathing condemnation of our rollback of free trade, calling it an insult to our trade partners and damaging to economic interests the world over. Stopping short of outright calling for a reversal, the letter makes it clear that none of its signatories support our actions.\n\nThe list of signatures even includes some big names from our own party. It has galvanised our opponents in the senate and given the media a lot of things to talk about - and in turn, the voters will be talking about our perceived lack of unity too. This is not a good look for us, to say the least."
WFB.response.14.a:0 "Why can't they keep their gripes\nto themselves?"
WFB.response.16.t:0 "The Ontario Accords"
WFB.response.16.desc: "For the time being, international trade remains as open as ever, much to the chagrin of those expecting the party to hold up its promises. However, there is a way we could use this situation to win back support. By getting our trade partners in the OFN to raise import quotas on American agricultural produce, we could take advantage of free trade to make a lot of money for the heartland states and, in turn, win their votes.\n\nA meeting has been scheduled in Ontario, where American diplomats will attempt to convince the OFN to up quotas. We could attempt a softball approach, asking them to raise quotas a little, or we could go all the way and push for a much greater increase. While the latter would win more support if successful, our allies may not respond well to our pushiness. What approach should we take?"
WFB.response.16.a:0 "Politely ask for a small increase."
WFB.response.16.b:0 "Push for a larger increase."

WFB.response.17.t:0 "OFN Accepts Our Demands!"
WFB.response.17.desc: "It was a hard sell, but our assembled allies in Ontario have agreed to a significant increase in agricultural imports from America. There was some griping, and some who felt that we were overstepping our bounds, but the result is all the same. We can expect these deals to provide billions of dollars worth of revenue to farming states, who are certain to appreciate our efforts when they return to the ballot box."
WFB.response.17.a:0 "Excellent!"

On the other hand, we could also still try the hardball approach in the hopes that our trade partners finally crack. There is risk here, of course, but a big deal would be very rewarding."

WAL.response.1.t:0 "To Undo the Mistake"
WAL.response.1.desc:0 "To many Americans, George F. Wallace entered office with their highest hopes. Alone he stood against both the duplicitous Republican-Democrats and the fanciful dreams of his new party's progressives and communists. His cause was one of succor in a tempest, a guiding light promising comfort and vigor renewed to a rain-soaked, fatigued man. With America's greatest generations behind him, Wallace paraded down the National Mall in his inauguration like Augustus leading a triumph in the streets of Rome: flush with victory, praised by men, and all but assured that the Republic will be restored under his rule.\n\nThe hindsight of having followed a lunatic to his downfall tastes like bitter, dry ash to many Americans' weary tongues. Grief and shame will follow them as companions for a good while yet.\n\nIn the meantime, President [Root.GetName] swears the oath of their office under cloudy skies and scattered rainshowers. [Root.GetHerHis] supporters came out in droves despite the weather, clinging to [Root.GetHerHis] uplifting words as rain-soaked, fatigued men cling to what embers burn in defiance of drizzle and damp cold. In every one of them can be found the irony of the forsaken, having their trust betrayed by one man promising them the world, bestow that very same trust to another claiming the very same. Perhaps they do recognize it, yet bestow their trust regardless in a fit of desperation -- so horrified are they of Wallace that they would risk another mistake for a chance, any chance, to undo the nightmare he had wrought.\n\nThe weight of duty bears heavy on the shoulders of every American President since George Washington. Yet in the midst of the nation's greatest crisis in decades, President [Root.GetName], it seems, shall bear heavier weights than most. For the American people, [Root.GetSheHe] must."
WAL.response.1.a:0 ""So help me God.""
WAL.response.2.t:0 "A Debate Retread"
WAL.response.2.desc:0 "From the blood-soaked fields of Gettysburg to the National Mall's Million Man March, America has fought itself many times for over a hundred years to definitively settle the colored man's place in its society. Many thought it resolved ever since Reconstruction; as the recent bedlam in cities across the South can attest, they thought wrong. Still, our party's leading figures questioned the wisdom of rocking the American boat overtly while we all suffered under Wallace's idiocy; one innocuous overture, they cautioned, may lose us the trust and votes we dearly needed to keep the party whole. Pandering for votes can come after the fragments of government are picked up and good governance made whole.\n\nTo their credit the strategy worked -- at least, until Congress booted Wallace out of office. Now the crisis has passed, and its bandaids have lost their hold over the deep fissures they had papered. Both left and right have mobilized their machines and their men, lumbering to life to again fight their respective sides in America's many issues. Now there is nothing the White House can do but to either rein what it can control... or tie its fortunes to either side.\n\nNormalcy may be returning to America, but in a fit of myopia, its people have forgotten what "normal" truly meant -- not an end to chaos, no, but rather its resumption after a century of pause."

WAL.response.3.t:0 "Heated Debate"
WAL.response.3.desc:0 "None stoke the American public's spirited, almost vitriolic, opinions more than civil rights. For a democracy habitually proclaiming its fundamental values, discourse over the extent to which it applies said values is and should be a given. Carefully handled, however, most governments can choose to ignore this debate while they manage other pressing concerns. Wallace handled it poorly; as the duty-obliged janitors cleaning up his many mistakes, we are left with no choice but to press one ear into the public pulse at all times.\n\nOur observations create a picture of violence and disorder gripping all forms of discussion over civil rights. Passionate souls engage in riotous behavior to prove their point, and policemen intervene to uphold the law's points. Rinse and repeat in upended barrooms, barricaded streets, and broken homes nationwide. Meanwhile, observers and pundits lambast the government's supposed inaction -- a criticism they conveniently forget to level towards its equally impotent opposition..."

WAL.response.4.desc:0 "Today Washington, D.C. is parley to an increasingly common disturbance: Demonstrations thousands strong, carrying picket signs, placards and posters; shouting slogans and pithies at the top of their lungs; and leaving behind a trail of garbage as they lumber from street corner to street corner. Meanwhile riot police assemble in palisades of shields and truncheons, journalists seek for prime viewing spots like VIPs in a concert hall, and counterprotesters make additional headaches out of law and order.\n\nThis time around, it is the civil rights activists and their allies parading up and down the National Mall. Proclaimed champions of the colored man's rights, among other things, they are by nature proclived to make a mess so the world will hear their words. Why America should listen to common knowledge like a broken vinyl record they have yet to explain -- but these modern day penitents continue their righteous crusade regardless.\n\nLess imperiled governments would consider such demonstrations as little more than brushstrokes on the vibrant mosaic defining liberal democracies' discourse. For us, however, they are manifestations of the dysfunction Wallace had wreaked into American politics... or the gouges he had made out of its extant cracks. Their root causes must be addressed before we can ever move on."

WAL.response.6.t:0 "Past Precedent"
WAL.response.6.desc:0 "Present problems share many similarities with their equivalents in the past. For all the strides modern man has made since the dawn of fire, human nature evolved little since; wars, for one, are still waged in the name of desires his ancestors thousands of years removed would recognize -- wealth, prestige, revenge, principle. The same can be said of the solutions man employs. Because of cooperation and compromise, the Greeks stonewalled Persia's mighty armies; scientists developed innovations that shaped history; and backwoods colonials birthed the world's mightiest republic.\n\nYes, peaceful agreements have accomplished just as much as the armies men resort to mustering should agreement fail to manifest. These agreements are also what America's governing party needs to act as the country's duly elected government; as it is, ideological divides and personal vendettas have hamstrung its ability to pass civil rights legislation, much less laws for other, less taxing issues.\n\nBefore this paralysis lingers long enough to stick for the next four years, the President must act posthaste to bring the party together..."

WAL.response.7.t:0 "Congress in Session"
WAL.response.7.desc:0 "To the man and woman, they entered the Senate chamber in a single file. Their strides swiveled with confidence from one step to the next -- a far cry from the terse, stilted struts they carried just days ago. They leveled easy grins and courtesies at one another as they paced towards their proper seats in America's most powerful semicircle.\n\nWhere before the silence that stifles would freeze their attention towards the dais and encase their smiles with cold insincerity, now they shuffled into their seats, wiped sweat beading on their foreheads with napkins, sifted through the documents on their binders, yawned the last dredges of sleep away. Old friends and allies exchanged pleasantries in the same breath as grand plans for bills, functions and elections. Rivals exchanged hushed barbs and retorts instead of ignoring the other's presence altogether. Others were content to bask in an ambience both foreign and familiar before the daily prayer.\n\nAnimus had returned to the party, thanks in no small part to the President's efforts to mend the fissures Wallace had left behind. It was with this renewed energy which the government's most esteemed lawmakers greeted the Vice President, the Senate Chaplain trailing behind him, and yet another day in Capitol Hill."

WAL.response.8.t:0 "Party Talk"
WAL.response.8.desc:0 "So. You've come to talk to us poor fellas then, Mister President?"\n\nBarry regarded the man nursing a mug of Budweiser across the table. Behind them both, Congressmen dined on oak tables scattered throughout the Rose Garden, ate gourmet dishes carried on silver trays and listened to soothing jazz solos played by the best bands in the Beltway -- all paid for by the federal government. Old hands learn to use money where it counts. Still, it pained the Arizonan to burn some hundred thousands of dollars to ease cornered rats, like Barry's companion. The man's bloodshot eyes locked with his while their owner quaffed his drink like a man gasping for water.\n\n"Wallace had some catastrophically bad ideas," he began, pausing for the right words. "But also some good ones hiding underneath. Ideas which we both value equally."\n\n"And you don't trust the Ivy Leaguers and liberals you hitched with no more." His Southern twang rolled thick with tar, spite and beer foam.\n\nBarry sighed. "Look, I know we didn't leave on the best of terms-"\n\nA snort.\n\n"-but there's no chance in Hell they'll go along with us here. You might." He shook his head. Any man his place would be just as tempted to finish the job. "No. You will."\n\nThe President returned his erstwhile colleague's stare with his own. "Right?"\n\nSmothered by silverware, conversation and jazz chords, their own silence stretched out unnoticed. What hesitation lingered in Barry's conscience faded as he held his ground against the spiteful, beleaguered exile.\n\nThen the erstwhile Democrat's lower broke into a grin, sputtering chuckles like an engine thrumming to life. He poured a bottle of beer on both his and an unused mug until amber liquid filled both to three-fourths their height.\n\n"If Philadelphia had more folk like you then me and mine wouldn't have jumped ship someplace greener!" the Congressman laughed out.\n\nBarry caught the mug slid his way as he let his breath loose. If not brought back to the fold, then they were at least now willing to vote with the party. Having their golden mouthpiece pledge his cooperation will see to that soon enough.\n\nThe Senator raised his mug towards the night sky. "To the union," he toasted, "next to our liberty, the most dear."\n\nBarry Goldwater chuckled. Trust South Carolina's fourth branch of government to fashion himself the next Calhoun. But it was all in good fun, so he humored his fellow Southerner with clinking mugs. "To union and liberty."\n\nAnd with that, Strom Thurmond joined the party in earnest."
WAL.response.8.a:0 "Barry glanced to the rest of the party.\nNot a single Republican in sight."
WAL.response.9.t:0 "Confrontation"
WAL.response.9.desc:0 "Vice President Rockefeller barged into the Oval Office just as Barry finished the last sheaf of tonight's paperwork. He caught the sigh before it left his throat.\n\n"With all due respect, Mister President..." Rockefeller's frowning mug grew deeper. "This wasn't what you promised."\n\nAh. News does travel fast in D.C.; rumors can entangle themselves in an intricate web of connections, helpless before press journalists looking for a scoop. Setting his fountain pen to its holder, the Arizonan tilted up and faced the New Yorker fully.\n\n"I promised the American people to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution," he answered, just like last... several conversations they've had as of late. "Now you ask me to play tyrant with its laws just because we're staying in the White House for four years?"\n\n"For the love of God, Barry, we've been through this before-"\n\n"And my opinion hasn't changed: It's not our job. Treat the states like children once and they'll act like children 'til the day we die."\n\n"So all the blacks out dying in Montgomery and Savannah are just kids' toys to you?!" Rockefeller bursted out, looking for all the world like a red-faced devil as he did. His pointed fingers accused the President of some grand crime only his Vice knew. "Is that your promise, Goldwater? Letting them suffer more in the hands of spoiled brats before we give them what they're owed?"\n\nBarry said nothing as he matched Rockefeller's glare. Silent moments later the man deflated, breaking contact.\n\n"Don't block it. Do anything else you want -- just promise us that." He trailed off. The unspoken threat hung in the humid night air like a guillotine. Barry's head or Rockefellers... it was pointless to argue whose deserves a basket. The party will have its headless man either way. If forced the choice, then President Goldwater preferred his head a martyr's.\n\nSo he rose up, gathered his files and empty mug, paced out of the Oval Office, switched the lights out, and called the Republican's bluff before he closed the door shut."

WAL.response.10.t:0 "Consequence"
WAL.response.10.desc:0 "At eight o'clock sharp, bells throughout the Capitol rang once, twice, thrice. Another morning, if drizzling and overcast, greeted the beating heart of American politics -- another day to sort out agendas, meet with their committees, vote for this law or that with their Ayes and Nays.\n\nSenators and Congressmen dressed up in their suits, finished their breakfasts, sent their kids and spouses off, rode the tram or walked to their offices umbrellas in hand, cussed their aides and secretaries for this folder or that schedule. They greeted their allies with warm smiles, their adversaries slightly more fictitious smiles, and voters the brightest smiles PR can beat into their faces. Those wedged uncomfortably between Beltway relevance and Beltway ignominy escaped oversight as Congress strutted like a conga line of peacocks into the Senate and House chambers. Taking their seats, the nation's Congressmen awaited the latest bout of long-standing procedure before another eight hours of business as usual.\n\nSeconds passed into minutes, then half-hours. Heads craning side to side, eyes wide, brows quirked up. No sign of the Vice President.\n\nMurmurs spread throughout the chamber. Someone counted heads -- Democrats, National Progressives, Independents. No Republicans. A good chunk of the seats, barren as a farm half-sunk under billowing dust. Another shouted for quorum, and so the room drowned in shouting until a gavel banged wood and salvaged procedure out of one unprocedural walkout."

Standing before a cheering crowd of hundreds on the steps of the Capitol, he is Moses made flesh, delivering the news of the bill that, just minutes ago, became law. The whips-more than one SCLC activist chuckled ruefully at the irony-had promised an easy passage through the Senate, and they had kept their word. Martin is still in Atlanta, but he'll be in Washington soon enough. For now, Abernathy will certainly do.\n\n"For so many years, longer than any of our lives or the lives of our mothers and our fathers, America has been a nightmare for black men and women. Wallace, he certainly tried to keep it that way. But Wallace is gone. And now, with our efforts and our blood, sweat, and tears, there is yet hope that we will wake up.""

WAL.response.13.desc:0 "In a turn of events that has stunned everyone, from the man on the street to the most experienced Washington operators, the Civil Rights Act has failed to pass! As gasps and shouts filled the floor of the US Senate, it became clear that legislators and lobbyists from America's political far-right had succeeded in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the dismantling of the Wallace administration's legacy.\n\nAlready, "spontaneous" celebratory demonstrations across the South and beyond have begun, waving signs and singing a certain century-old tune. At the same time, word is spreading of a brewing counterprotest movement. Civil rights activists are calling for Washington to be the site of mass marches, and for similar disruption to take place nationwide. Whether or not it makes a difference, only time will tell, but for those Americans who were hoping to forget the last administration, today has been a shocking betrayal."
