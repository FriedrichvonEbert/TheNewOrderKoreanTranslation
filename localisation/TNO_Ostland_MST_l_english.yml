### Ideas ###
MST_The_Old_Guard:0 "Old Guard Support"
MST_The_Old_Guard_desc:0 "While many in the Old Guard are indifferent towards Meyer's promise of reform, they stand behind him hoping that Meyer will defeat both Dreschler and Stalhechler. These men are both battle hardened and experienced, and have connections to Germany which would secure the reality of Meyer's future. The incorporation of the Old Guard into Meyer's forces will surely be of great benefit towards advancing his noble cause."
MST_The_Young_Brothers:0 "젊은 형제들의 지원"
MST_The_Young_Brothers_desc:0 "Meyer's promise for liberal reform and change has brought him a sort of support that no other contender has- student support. All across Ostland, like-minded youth are rallying behind Meyer in order to bring about much needed change that Ostland has lacked in the past. Regardless of education, these young individuals know that Andreas Meyer-Landrut is their best chance at securing a brighter future for Ostland and its people."
MST_Land_Rights_1:0 "토지 권리 약속"
MST_Land_Rights_1_desc:0 "Under German control, natives have been disenfranchised and brutally repressed by the Germanic population within the region. Andreas Meyer-Landrut aims to fix this injustice by granting all natives specific land rights to better protect their freedoms. The three rights include a promise of his goodwill to the native people, supplies and provisions to carry out said promise, and finally a guarantee on the safety and freedom of the newly created land rights for the native Ostland people."
MST_Land_Rights_2:0 "토지 권리 제공"

MST_Social_Rights_1:0 "사회적 권리 약속"
MST_Social_Rights_1_desc:0 "Within the Ostland Social hierarchy, pure Germans are granted far more freedoms and advantages than the native Ostland people. As a result, Ostland has grown continuously more divided as a vocal native majority have resisted the continued occupation and inequality ever present in society. Andreas Meyer has promised to do away with such inequality, and has promised the people of Ostland the means to fulfill their wishes. "

MST_The_Drive_For_Freedom:0 "자유로"
MST_The_Drive_For_Freedom_desc:0 "Meyer has brought a shining light of hope to students across all of Ostland, and as such has inspired countless to take up arms in pursuit of a brighter future. The students, in their numbers and cause, have brought about a renewed sense of vigor amongst Meyer and his associates. Only together can we bring about a better future for Ostland and its people."

MST.1.t:0 "어둠속의 빛"
MST.1.desc:0 "Meyer often saw something the rest did not see in the eyes of those his Fatherland declared inhuman, hostile, and inferior. Standing closely by the window of his old office, observing the activity of the city which now served as the center of his own faction, he stared beyond the glass, seeing more than just what met the eye, as people sought refuge here. He could not erase the faces of those he helped once; their gratitude, their relief, and their hope of these people.\n\nMeyer looked away, recalling what he had done for them before all this came to be, risking everything he had, especially his life, for the sake of others who needed his help. Now he stepped away, remembering how his supporters came out into the open for him.\n\nHe hoped to bring reforms from within the former system. He had not wanted a war for his reforms to take place.\n\nBut war has come. And now it has taken Ostland and ripped it apart. All around him, the land burned and continues to burn with hatred and vengeance being released by monstrous partisans, treacherous nationalists; by Germans set against one another, believing in different ways to live their lives.\n\nForced to take greater responsibility so quickly, so abruptly, the opportunity was thrusted into his arms to decide the fate of Ostland through force.\n\nMeyer trembled at what he realized he had to do.\n\nRemembering what he had done for others, he knew what he had to do. But now he had to do more than what he had done before.\n\nSo he chose to cease trembling. He stepped out of his office, leaving all the things he had in his previous life. All his assets, all his wealth. He would give all of that up to see to his new duties. He had to do more, to bring these people out of the nightmare.\n\n"
MST.1.a:0 "어둠속의 빛이군."

MST.2.t:0 "Face-Heel Turn"
MST.2.desc:0 "I don't really believe in anything anymore, and that applies to ideologies too, no matter how lofty they seem to be. I don't really need any of that in my life. But I can tell you what I have done for something others believed in.\n\nDuring Ostland's war, I found myself defecting over to the liberal faction. I was with my comrades. And they too saw that it was useless to fight for those of the likes of Dreschler and Stalhechler.\n\nTch. Those bastards blinded themselves, making themselves think that there was something good in what they think would lead Ostland forward. Everyone around me sort of knew it too. It was all a sham. And that was why it was so easy for me and my comrades to get out of there and into the ranks of the students and the natives, the ones who believed in Meyer.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong here. I don't give a fuck about what they believe in. I just wanted to make sure that I and my comrades got of this alive. And I did just that.\n\nI didn't give a shit too much about the natives and the students. Sure, the former are sore about their homelands and their peoples. And sure, the students seem to believe in things way too good to be true. But at least they were decent people to fight side by side with. At least we stood together against those fucking bastards.\n\nAnd of course, we made sure that we wouln't forget about Kovner. That fucking monster of a Jew.\n\nBut that's the only point I'm making here: I did my part. I don't believe in it. But I knew it was something that wouldn't get me and my comrades six feet under the earth.\n\n"
MST.2.a:0 "At least that's something I believe in that's worth all the trouble."

MST.3.t:0 "더 나은 세계를 위해"
MST.3.desc:0 "It is amazing how much those younger than us dream for something better. I never really thought much about better things. I worried about myself. I never really studied too much, as I finished what I had to learn just to get a job at a small workshop. I never really thought much about those children who spent their days in fancy universities.\n\nWhen the war began, I thought these students would pack up, begging Herr Meyer for a way out of here, away from the fighting. They couldn't go back to Germany; it was also at war. Even I couldn't return to my hometown, no matter how much I wanted to bring myself out of Ostland. But I was wrong about these kids.\n\nI found myself staring at them in shock, mouth wide open as I was returning home from work. There had been a massive gathering at the university along my usual way. There were so many of them, these young people. They were all lining up to sign their names and get going to the fighting.\n\nAnd I just stood there, looking at these people, bringing themselves to risk all they had for a better world, a world that I thought would probably never come. I guess I never really knew how much potential they had. I'm glad they've played a part to save our homes here in Ostland.\n\n"
MST.3.a:0 "They've wanted a better world, and that was how they got the chance."

MST.4.t:0 "모든 이들을 위한 자리"
MST.4.desc:0 "We want our homes back. We want our lands back. We want to live as we have lived before. We want a place for ourselves," one of the native representatives told Meyer.\n\n"Yes," spoke up another, "And we too seek what we have not been able to have before the war. We want rights to purchase land; to sell it; and to keep it for our families, our own people. We want to be free to use the land as you Germans have been free to use it when you came here."\n\nMeyer nodded and understood their intentions. Even as some of the delegates began to gently warn their companion who was too harsh with his tone towards Meyer, the head of the coalition himself did not mind it.\n\n"I understand all of you. I really do. And I am willing to see these concerns met so, after the war, we will be able to live peacefully."\n\nThe delegates nodded and muttered their agreements. But in Meyer's mind, he knew that he would have to make all these things smooth with his fellow countrymen. There would be a lot to do to get the natives the rights for the lands they wished for so long.\n\nHe finally got to a decision, faced the natives, and told them,\n\n"
MST.4.a:0 "I'll promise you all that you'll get what you want in due time."
MST.4.b:0 "I'll work on the provisions. You'll have them, my friends."
MST.4.c:0 "I give you all my guarantee that you'll receive them."

MST.5.t:0 "인간의 권리"
MST.5.desc:0 "A native delegation approached Meyer one day, bringing their case to him without any delay. He sat down with them, discussing what they had for him.\n\nThey have told him that they wanted better rights for themselves. They desired to be treated as Germans treated their own countrymen. And that they deserved to be recognized as equals.\n\n"We promise to do more for you, to see this war come to an end as quickly as possible. But won't you grant us these rights we ask from you for our people?" was what one native man said, earning nods from his companions.\n\nMeyer listened to all they had to say, and he agreed with them. He knew they were just as human as he was. And that it would have to be addressed as soon as possible. He told them, "You are all free to ask these things. It's important for everyone to have rights. I can't possibly deny them to your people."\n\n"We know," said another man, "and that is why we believe in you. You are not like the rest of your people. And we hope you would listen. So what is your decision?"\n\nMeyer thought carefully about it. He realized that if he agreed to everything they asked of him, the coalition could come under some strain. There were other Germans who were not so eager to welcome the natives as if they were like Germans. But now he had to decide."
MST.5.a:0 "I promise you that you will have these rights after the war is over."
MST.5.b:0 "I'll make provisions for your people. And I will do more once the war is over."
MST.5.c:0 "I'll guarantee all of it for your people."

 MST_Elite_Men_desc:0 "The same defectors from Riga have come up with something useful.\n\nIt appears to us that they have formed an elite division of infantry, eager to give their lives for the cause, and with the necessary skills and leadership to bring our dreams forward into the future.\n\nLet us celebrate this through the good use of their arms.

It is a miracle.\n\nWith these new tools to protect our people, to promote our cause, and to secure Ostland from strife and war, we have more hopes of victory!

 MST_Those_We_Stand_With_desc:0 "We do not stand alone in our hopes of bringing something new to the face of Ostland.\n\nNatives of the land have come to our territory, bringing their hopes of a better future for themselves forward.

Hopefully, we will be able to keep our friends and come to a reasonable solution. And with Meyer leading us, surely we can do something for them.

 MST_The_Issue_of_Rights:0 "권리 문제"
 MST_The_Issue_of_Rights_desc:0 "Yet again, our native comrades come to us with an issue. Now, they seek rights. Rights to be human beings, rights to enjoy the same things we enjoy, to be in the same room as us without being asked to take off their hats to us, and to be free to live in their own homeland as they once had before the Reich overtook it.\n\nThis may cause great turmoil within our ranks. But what will Meyer do for us? What decision will he choose to take?"
 MST_Native_Support:0 "원주민의 지원"
 MST_Native_Support_desc:0 "Our native comrades have chosen to give all they can give to our cause. Emboldened by what Meyer has done for them, has said for them, they have gone out of their way to fully embrace what we all want for Ostland.\n\nFor our homes and for their own, together we are going to stand and fight against the people who are ruining this land.

 MST_Those_From_Wilna:0 "빌나에서 온 자들"
 MST_Those_From_Wilna_desc:0 "Out of the classrooms and the libraries, the laboratories and the workshops, college students have come out in support of our cause. They see Meyer as their idol, their guide to a better future.\n\nThey are a great addition to our cause, for there are many of them willing to give their lives for the rewards of change. But they are more devoted to the promises they seek to bring, and they may be more zealous than we really are. Hopefully, they will stand with us no matter how far we go."

 MST_For_a_Free_Ostland_desc:0 "The students are becoming more energetic about the cause, and their cohesion is improving. They have become a powerful force in our coalition.

 MST_The_Youth_Stand_With_Us_desc:0 "The youth organizations have come to solidify their faith in Meyer's promises.

 MST_College_Recruits_desc:0 "We have great news!\n\nOut of their desire to push for the victory of our cause, the youth have come together, forming two divisions out of the best of their numbers.\n\nAlthough they are not as experienced as their counterparts from Riga, nor are they as familiar with the land as our native friends, they are a welcome addition to our forces doing their best to win this war for our common dream."

Despite everything that has come against us, we have done more than anyone could have done.\n\nNow it is up to us to follow his lead in the reconstruction of Ostland. And together with him, we must do our part to keep our dream alive against outside forces seeking to extinguish our hopes for a future for all of humanity."
