 OFN_AFR_DECOL_ANG.0.desc:0 "Lavelle read over the latest report from reconnaissance groups in the southern regions and groaned. More ambushes, more damaged trucks, more locals and soldiers dead. Washington did not seem to get how the native populations would be hostile to any foreign government, Mandate or Reichskommissariat. Even the engineers working to rebuild bombed bridges and clear out filled wells found little gratitude from the people they helped.\n\nThe situation, he had to admit to his staff, was nigh untenable. He was here to help establish a free republic in Angola, and it was clear the Angolans were ready to do so, and without American aid.\n\n"Davey" he said over the intercom, "get me Sangumba and Carreira. We've wasted enough lives out here."\n\nTaking his hand off the button, he sighed, and looked at the grasslands that stretched out beyond the city's limits."

Security had been bumped up more than ever as MPLA and UNITA figures drove into town with crowds watching from the buildings. The Angolan people, after occupation by Portuguese, German, and American, might soon forge their own path. General John Lavelle opened the conference to all the representatives present, emphasizing his wish for a peaceful withdrawal of troops across the Mandate, along with the return of all American prisoners. His speech, short and simple, gathered applause from all present.\n\nFirst to speak was Jorge Sangumba, arguing for his group of freedom fighters to establish a transitional government led by UNITA before elections began to rebuild the most damaged and uncontrolled regions of the country. Next was Iko Carreira, whose MPLA clique promised to provide a more leftist government for the Angolan people, whose lives and wealth had been squandered by prior regimes. When Iko finished his declaration, a UNITA leader questioned the legitimacy of immediate post-independence elections, when there was much work to be done outside of Luanda's political circles.\n\nThe days wore on as more groups took to the podium to offer their answers to the future of the mandate, and blocs began to form around the two major parties. Only a few serious contenders remained, but Lavelle could not put his full support behind any of them."

UNITA's higher-ups were much more agreeable than the MPLA, with Chairman Neto showing far more sympathy with Cameroon than Washington. While a far more risky option than either of the two main blocs, the general could choose one of the smaller and more flexible leaders, though such a decision could lead to nothing short of an escalation of conflict. Had Angola not seen enough bloodshed?\n\nRetiring to his quarters, the general heard the representatives squabbling among themselves, unaware the burden of their future lay on his shoulders, not theirs!\n\nDawn came, and as Lavelle stepped up to the podium, he took a deep breath.\n\n"In the interests of the Southwest African Mandate, I will support the transitional government of...""

At the eve of the South African War, German administrators discovered truly vast oil reserves off the coast of Cabinda. While the territory fell under Muller's tyranny, it had been considered part of Portuguese Angola for much time before, and would be a boon to the soon-to-be country's economy.\n\nThe issue lay in that while plans were already in motion to make a free, American-friendly Cabinda to get cheap oil, both the MPLA and UNITA desired to incorporate both the region and its oil, a move Washington would most likely ignore or contend with. General Lavelle mulled over the maps sprawled before him, hoping some answer would come forth to him.\n\nHe heard a sharp rap on the door.

He opened up his wallet to see the picture of mom and dad; still smiling back at him when he departed for Africa.\n\nHe shifted himself on his cane, picking up the faint noise of local music amongst the bustling airbase. The Angolans seemed happy enough - no more tanks and bombers in their towns. He'd taken a bullet in his knee from some sniper, God knows which side. Was it for nothing? Was having to go home to Akron with a cane like some retiree all he got from months of wading through forests and villages with twenty different rebel factions aiming to kill?\n\nHe climbed aboard the transport plane, and peered out from a window to see a small truck carrying at least a dozen young boys, chanting and flying their flag. They stopped and drove circles, hoisting the banner up as it was consumed in a cloud of dust. Maybe, he mused, the reward was that they wouldn't have to take a bullet."

Eventually, this contest erupted into all out armed conflict across the region (See attached documents 2b and 5c for relevant information). Attempts to broker a longer term ceasefire on the part of General Lavelle with UNITA's Jonas Savimbi and Agostinho Neto on behalf of the MPLA fell flat almost immediately. Both sides made clear to the general that they were no longer interested in keeping the peace (General Lavelle's debrief of this meeting is attached; document 2F).\n\nFollowing this meeting, the general ordered all OFN forces to avoid hostilities with either faction, and even ordered elements stationed in the Rundu and Lunda regions to return to Luanda (General Lavelle's directive attached; document 1E). Unfortunately, this seems to have only bought us a small break; within a week UNITA and MPLA guerrillas were ambushing our convoys and assaulting villages we had announced as under our protection. A rapid deterioration of our control in the region then followed, with numerous outposts across Angola falling under determined attacks that were successful in forcing OFN forces to fall back.\n\nAfter a few days of this, General Lavelle exercised his judgement and ordered a complete pull out of Angola. The Mandate was finished, and Lavelle was not willing to sacrifice the lives of his men for a lost cause."

 OFN_AFR_DECOL_COG.0.desc:0 "It's all going down. Months of political incompetence, ignorance of the natives' situation and coalition-crashing has led our mandate to become a hotpot of boiling, exploding tensions. Try as we might (although, our "trying" might be the cause of this all), our authority outside of major cities and a few key resource-centers is all but collapsing. Mass rioting, insurrection across the board. Outposts blown to shreds and seized by freedom-fighters, shops in smithereens. Our attempts to subjugate the jungles have ended disastrously. We can't let our casualty numbers begin leaking out of the confines of our mandate, nor can we be seen spitting on the all-glorious legacy of American foreign intervention. We've gotta save face and there's only one man for the job. Decolonization of the Congo begins now, whether the brass back home like it or not.\n\nGeneral Abrams stood dour in the morning heat of Léopoldville square, where a meeting between him, his OFN advisors and whichever native representatives showed up would begin. The motorcade which had brought him here watched the street-corners eagle-eyed, snipers dotting the roofs of local buildings. Abrams' foot tapped against the soup-like air, waiting for just about anyone to show themselves. Looking downwards, Abrams' wondered if he was fucked beyond recognition. Only time would reveal this fact. Surely... surely, someone would come, right?\n\nIn the dry, boiling and still air, Abrams could make out a sharp thumping. A dash of shrieks, a sprinkle of explosions. Something... something terrible was on the horizon. Pacing anxiously now, Abrams prayed for anyone, ANYONE, to show themselves."

The grass dried in the still air, and shiny, black leather shoes slid along the boiling concrete below. Abrams' eyes glanced around, blotches of sweat breaking through the beige field jacket he had thrown on earlier in the morning. To the casual observer, he would more resemble an overweight gymnasium teacher than the overseer of a global alliance's mandate. Teetering anxiously in place, Abrams began to recite his good ol' stress cleanser, a traditional American speech, to those waiting around him. "Y'know, there is something to be said for the American spirit, to stomach the goddamned horrors of the 'Dark Continent' all in the name of some vague and hazy war of ideology, war of superpowers over some dirt, stones and liquid gold. And to not only stomach that, but to stomach caring for these bone-broken birds we call African peoples and tribes, even when they bite us for the freedom we grant 'em."\n\nAs Abrams' flabby jaw yapped on, and a crowd of locals formed around Abrams to witness their 'savior' in person, the motorcades of who were to come finally got to showing themselves. First was that quiet, slim but tall fella, Jacques Opangault, representing the uh... Parti Démocratique Orungu, was it? Them traditionalist-types, French bootlickers as some would say. "As me and my fellows say back home, these are times of judgement, but I can't see a damn thing I've done wrong! Look at this one, Oh-pung-nut, huh? This. This is what the next generation of African patriots is gonna look like. Ain't you dedicated, son?" On trudged Alphonse Massamba-Débat, representative of the Brazzavillian National Unity Party. Average-looking fella I suppose, but Abrams knew he had that communist, 'anti-imperialist' bite lurking behind his soft smile. Then came Justin Marie Bomboko, of Mouvement National Congolais fame, Lumumba's party. Abrams knew as soon as he saw the lil', scrunched-up fella, he was just Lumumba's pack mule.\n\n"But let me assure you all." Abrams wagged about a pork sausage finger. "We got honor, and it is our duty to see everyone-a ya get REAL freedom, the type you can feel rumblin' in your gullet, or in your prayers." Out from the now-heavier crowd slithered forth Jean Schramme. A white man taking part in Africa's negotiations. All for the sake of plantations, managed by Belgian colonial remnants. Needless to say, the other representatives, Massamba-Débat especially, were giving him the stink-eye every movement he propelled towards. "Now, let's get this shitshow over with..."

It was orderly and all for a little while, even whenever Schramme was around... somehow. They took their seats, talked all nice and fulfilled whatever acts o' diplomacy were asked of them. Great, whatever. What matters is the meat and po-tatas, policy talk, and first to come up was the status of those Brazzavillians in Gabon, or, Orungu as those natives were callin' it now. The chuckle-worthy part of this all was how the situation on the ground wasn't even on the brink of disaster, like the rest of the Congo. The Brazzavillians got along with their neighbors, and why wouldn't they? But, as always, there's politics in those fellows' races.\n\nThe Orungun fellows, the PDO, despite ass-kissing the OFN and OFN proxies all they could, got no restraint from those at the conference. French bootlickers, the other representatives called them, orangutans, as Abrams either mistakenly or very purposefully referred to them. With a still, but intelligent apprehension, the PDO moved for all of Orungu to be united, no matter the racial differences of the peoples therein. As far as Abrams could tell, there wasn't any real differences between them. "Africans cling to their tribes, that's sure as hell." Abrams remarked. Following the PDO's statement, Massamba-Débat of the BNUP spoke up for the freedom of those Brazzavillians on the ground against the repeated colonial tyranny of the PDO. What's the difference between a Frenchie exploiting you, or an Orungun pretending to be a Frenchie? Abrams managed to follow their logic.\n\nWatching with his advisors the PDO and BNUP slug shit at each other through more and more verbal vomit, Abrams got to the real decision-making. Sure... we could grant those Brazzavillians independence, but do we really wanna weaken our lil' collaborators in the PDO? American interests take precedent over these bastards' sob stories, Abrams thought. Though, he didn't like the thought of yet another Congolese race war on his hands.

He arrived to a maelstrom of applause, of frightful joy and respect. Fashionably late, he had sent his toady Justin Marie Bomboko in his stead. But he was here now, and he was going to face the judgement of General Abrams head on. To the populace, he was a rockstar of Congolese liberation, to his political allies, he was a Pan-African firebrand. To Abrams and the OFN advisors who surrounded him, he was the greatest obstacle to America's vision for the Congo. Patrice Lumumba, and the MNC which had organized around Lumumba's words, prepared to fight for Africa's freedom despite the opposition of their 'liberators.'\n\nIndeed, he spoke with fire. Extolling a socialist, anti-colonial and Pan-African dream, Lumumba cried out for the present representatives to share his vision, to fight with him. In the dim lights of the courthouse, Lumumba's eyes could not be seen behind his glasses. The heat broke him into a heavy sweat, but though his suit and bowtie bent down with his dampening, Lumumba stood tall. This was his chance to turn the present representatives against their REAL enemy, to make them see who wanted to undermine their dreams of freedom to fulfill their capitalist greed. This enemy he spoke of was sitting off to the side of the courthouse, brow furrowed, wondering who was going to replace Lumumba as leader of the Congo. There was no doubt in Abrams' head, Lumumba had to go.\n\nOne of the OFN's advisors whispered in Abrams' ear of Joseph Kasa-Vubu. A man America could trust. A strongman. Patriot. "But-" came from the other advisors, "there are rumors, not yet substantiated. Kasa-Vubu may have worked with Zentralafrika, perhaps even Müller himself." While normally not an issue, the Congolese citizenry would hate a collaborator on top, and the public back in the US even more so. Another, Joseph Iléo, was whispered of. Popular amongst the citizenry. Though, such a man could never have the same connections with the Congolese army Kasa-Vubu did.

The map, in comparison to those of earlier decades, was a story. Cities, nations, cultures and identities gone or clinging to the edge of the Congo Lake. Abrams recalled Africa from when he was but a child, and there was no hole in it. What those Nazi fuckers had done was an affront to God, to nature. Disgusting. The representatives in the courtroom circled around the just-placed map, which seemed to shimmer in the sunlight bleeding through the otherwise dim courtroom. The bony, elongated and clammy fingers of Abrams' OFN advisors stuck themselves to the entrance of the Congo Basin, around which was the Congo Dam. A dynamo of economic activity, of trade and hydroelectric power. The water pouring and roaring through its flood gates could kill armies and power nations. Of course, the instinct of Abrams and his advisors was to "protect" the dam with US forces, so as to keep it safe from "rebels" and anyone who might dare to challenge the economic opportunities the dam represented.\n\nJustin Marie Bomboko, who had stuck around even after Lumumba was rushed out, had a somewhat different instinct. Surely, he stated, if this new Congolese Republic was going to be a strong and influential ally of the US in the region, it needed control over the Congo Dam to keep its economy afloat in the oncoming hard times. The OFN advisors sneered but Abrams saw where Marie Bomboko was coming from. Sometimes, after all, it's just better to let go.\n\nCollapsing back into the chairs bordering the courtroom, Abrams' body tensed up in response to the hard rails along the chair's back. Forced into a compromising attitude, Abrams thought of a clever solution both the Africans and the boys back home could appreciate. Say, both OFN troops and the Congolese guarded the dam, split the profits and the hydroelectricity, we could all sing "Kumbaya!" The men around the courtroom were less enthused. A logistical nightmare is what it sounded like. The Orunguns too were eyeing the project, and could only be galvanized by a split defense force.

Though, something bothered Abrams as he watched his advisors grouped together, pouring into documents upon documents. A prominent and influential political figure who, despite showing up, had not yet presented their case. So, Abrams thought, their demands must be worth the wait. Abrams leaned his head over and gestured him forward. Jean Schramme, representative of the Belgian plantation owners reigning over Katanga, slithered forward. Pulling out a cigar to earmark the end of this ordeal, Abrams demanded "Spit it out Sch-ram, I know you've got something to say."\n\nIn choppy, heavily-accented English, Schramme responded "Katanga. Katanga is all."\n\n"That's it, huh? A "free" Katanga, for you and your lil' Belgian buddies. You notice it, Sch-ram? A white man in a crowd of blacks, whole African stock. Whose leg do you think you're pulling? A lot of Nazi collab-or-a-tors is what you are. But... well, how much money are you and your friends gonna be providing your close 'allies' in the OFN?"\n\nSchramme, somewhat dazed at the near-vomitous output of American-accented english, gathered his thoughts and stated "...Money?" before leaning in and whispering into Abrams' ear "Much, much, much more than those Congo monkeys." Pulling outwards, Schramme flashed Abrams a glance of understanding before leaving the courtroom. It didn't take a genius to tell American interests were at stake.

Pressed against the cameras and notepads of a few local journalists, Abrams told them the end of his mandate was upon them, and that they should spread his news. The journalists scattered to their bicycles, taking a few pictures of Abrams standing triumphantly in the glare of streetlights before leaving for the presses. Representatives took copies of the treatises with them, to be looked at with either satisfaction or scorn by the groups they represented. Usually scorn. Shoddily-printed copies would be attached to walls everywhere, to boards across the Congo for the groping eyes of the peasantry to stare at in joy but also confusion. In a single day and night the Congo was restructured totally, all under the guidance of a single man who, if historical sources are being honest, did not care as much as most people in such a position would.\n\nTaken in by the cold, black leather seats of his motorcade, Abrams breathed easy for the first time since he was appointed head administrator of the Congo. He breathed easy for a few seconds before breaking into a fit of deep and violent coughs. There was a gnawing pain in his chest. It had been a minor nuisance for a while but it had gotten desperately terrible as of late. Staring at his pack of cigars, Abrams clutched at his chest with a pained expression, praying for the dread to dissipate. How much longer did our self-styled nation-builder have? Abrams was beginning to wonder.\n\nAcross the Congo, in what would be the first and last time for centuries to come, every person from Orungun agricultural-workers, Congolese politicians to Belgian plantation owners, celebrated their independence day. In Léopoldville, fireworks exploded above into magical works of colorful light and wonder. For the first time since before the Europeans colonized Africa, freedom could reign."

The Congolese Republic, led by Patrice Lumumba, had laid claim to the lands that made up the former Central African Mandate. The CNP's newly established nation, the Federal Republic of the Congo, had done the very same. Now, as conflict seemed on the horizon, they needed a leader.\n\nThey had promised to select a leader that day. Joseph Kasa-Vubu had been their choice. A popular, energetic man, Kasa-Vubu had been one of the strongest advocates for total Congolese independence. Only hours before they were set to announce this, however, they had received striking news: Kasa-Vubu had defected, joining Lumumba's rival state. That was what had brought the CNP to this state of panic: The Americans were gone, the Republic seemed ready to invade any day, and their own leader had betrayed them. As the assembly struggled to find a new candidate, two possible leaders came to light.\n\nCyrille Adoula was one of the most prominent members of the Congolese National Party, and one of its strongest voices for change. A known supporter of trade unions and liberal democracy, Adoula is a candidate who will likely strive towards the vision America had tried to achieve with their mandate, before abandoning us. Not all agree with Adoula, however, and it is rumored disagreements with him caused Kasa-Vubu's defection.\n\nAnother, perhaps safer alternative, is Joseph Iléo. A conservative, Iléo is likely to be more in line with the Christian values of the Congolese. He furthermore is much more anti-colonialist, denouncing the American mandates as another attempt to enslave and colonize the free peoples of the Congo by uncaring powers a world away.

While reports flooded back to General Westmoreland, the remaining authorities began requesting a plan for independent states across the vast swathe of Africa. Leaders from dozens of African organizations sent letters or representatives calling for ceasefires or presenting their demands. Each one showed little concern for the goals of the politician or general next door, and sending out correspondence to every man with enough guns to call himself "president" or "secretary" would be pointless.

The independence groups were all given short dossiers on the general's own goals for the conference, and allowed to meet and strategize to best follow suit with his master plan.

The first one was a man the CIA had apparently been talking with for some time; Eduardo Mondlane. Flipping over the pages of information in his own archives and the testament delivered to him, he was the popular choice. A dashing middle-aged man who earned a good name for hunting Germans in the rural parts of the country. A good soldier, no leader, if he wasn't such a stickler for independence. His followers would go on incessantly about an end to all military aid, even from Washington itself! How naive was he to think the Americans would let the men they've sold every weapon under the sun to get away with cutting ties?

The public already threw a fit when their sons went off to fight the Germans; facing off the IJA over the same bombed-out cities would be a nightmare to explain.

This was not an easy choice to make but I am confident that it was the right one to save the lives of our people from a fight we could not presently win. I realize that this was done without prior approval however, and am willing to receive whatever disciplinary measures that I am given.\nEMERGENCY REPORT END"

 OFN_AFR_DECOL_CAR.2:0 "EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION\nCONFIDENTIAL\nI can't put this in any simpler terms: things in the Central African Republican have gone from bad to irrevocably broken. We knew the project was never going to last indefinitely, it was never meant to anyways. The problem was - is Westmoreland. Westmoreland. What happened to the man? We still don't fully know, might never know, the whole truth at this point. Still, it seems clear that he's had some sort of psychotic break or some other sort of mental trauma. Nothing else we've modeled so far could explain his incredibly wild and erratic actions as the CAR collapsed around him.\n\nThe facts we do know are this: when the reports of the collapse started filtering into General Westmoreland's headquarters, instead of ordering a full scale fall back in preparation for extraction, the general ordered all forces to hold their positions and reassert order by any means necessary. An impossible order, an insane order. The response was to be expected: most on-the-ground commanders moved to the nearest ports and began to leave the continent. We estimate that 90% of our men left following the general's impossible demands.\n\nThe other 10% seemed willing to follow their lander through this madness however. With nine-tenths of his forces deserted, it was all the general could do to establish defensive perimeters around Leopoldville and Quelimane. As of this report, they are still holding out there, but each passing day costs them supplies, food, and manpower. We estimate that we don't have much longer. We could attempt to save them, but our earimations are not promising. Frankly, no one in the Pentagon is interested in bailing out a madman who dug his own grave.\n\nRecommendation: we cut our losses on this one."
