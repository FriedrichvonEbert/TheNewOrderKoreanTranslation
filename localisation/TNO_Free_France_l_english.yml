 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC:0 ""자유 프랑스"가 자리한 이래, 샤를 드골은 그 키를 잡고 서있었습니다. For more than 20 years, de Gaulle has led the last remaining Free French in a desperate and drawn out battle for survival against the greatest odds. He was once a division commander in the army of the Fourth French Republic, keen to bring reform to their forces. His attempts were made too late however and France quickly fell the Wehrmacht. Keen to continue the fight, de Gaulle rallied what support he had and headed to Africa. Although the fighting continued, de Gaulle fared little better here. Over the years, the forces of Free France were relentlessly pursued across Africa until only the tiniest strip of what had once been the colonial possessions of the French Republic remained. Through it all, de Gaulle has been both a great boon and a great curse for those that still follow the dream of a Free France. The man is utterly convinced of "La Libération" to the point where it is hard not to share in the aging leader's sheer enthusiasm. Sadly, his conviction is paired with an extreme stubbornness. de Gaulle is unwilling to end the unpopular military government, despite the fact that his generals are usually too busy working as mercenaries for other West African nations and even the Germans in Zentralafrika. de Gaulle soldiers on, making his radio addresses and inspecting the troops each day, seemingly convinced that it will be part of the start of their journey home. He has even promised elections, although with the deadline drawing ever nearer, some are uncertain if de Gaulle is willing to even surrender that much to the people. Nor has he properly acknowledged the generals that wish to see him gone, and the fact they would be quite capable of having their wish fulfilled. de Gaulle must perhaps realise his situation and be willing to make compromises, should he wish to see his homeland ever again."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC1:0 "자유 프랑스를 뺀 다른 모든 곳에선 드골을 실패자라 여깁니다. 드골은 가장 어두운 시점에서 조국을 일으키는 데 실패했습니다. 드골은 전쟁주력을 지원하는 데 실패했습니다. 드골은 프랑스를 실망시켰습니다. 하지만 그건 자유 프랑스 바깥에서의 이야기에 불과합니다. 이제는 희미해져가는 이라 할지라도, 자유 프랑스에서 그는 영웅입니다. 누구도 드골의 감화력과 낙관주의를 부정할 수 없으며, 드골은 스스로를 위해 빚어낸 조그마한 제국에서 자신의 그러한 특성을 최대한으로 이용하고 있습니다. 지나온 그 모든 역경들에도, 드골의 프랑스에서 프랑스인들은 여전히 거리를 행진하며, 라 마르세예즈를 제창하고 "자유, 평등, 박애"를 찬탄합니다.\n\n세상 누구라도 샤를 드골에게 확신할 수 있는 건 그가 절대 프랑스를 포기하지 않으리란 것입니다. 마지막 숨을 내뱉는 그 순간까지, 드골은 포기하지 않을 겁니다."

While it is true that De Gaulle promsied his elections for before 1965, he doesn't seem enclined to follow his promise. Pierre Mnedès-France with the help of multiple thinkers, both gaullists, nouvelle-vaguistes and socialists, wrote a declaration to be published and sold on the open market. Press is free in Free France, and the declaration quickly spread around the homes of the Free French.\n\nDe Gaulle's cabinet has seen this as a threat to his leadership, but Charles de Gaulle doesn't see any harm in free press and people wanting more freedom, a cause of frustation in his high command."

A respected General, Prince Napoléon had been out in the field inspecting one of our forward positions along the Ghanaian border when radio difficulties led to an inability to warn the stationed garrison of an impending German bombing raid. Severely wounded, the General was carried to an emergency field hospital where he later died during surgery.\n\nPretender to the French Imperial Throne and veteran of the Second World War, General Bonaparte became highly respected by the Free French Army for his personal involvement in the war efforts, and came to act as an unofficial figurehead through his attempts to keep our beleaguered people united. Already Charles de Gaulle has declared that the General shall receive a full state funeral, causing controversy with Republican elements of our government, and vowed the body would be reinterred in France upon the Libération. General Bonaparte leaves behind his eleven year old son Charles, who will now take up his father's mantle as head of the Imperial House of France."

Charles de Gaulle stand strong with his idea of a strong ruler, someone who can represent the french spirit and have power over most decisions. Mendès-France tends to want a state with more power to the people, not as much as in a socialist state, but with a stronger civilian-elected parliament which can override the decisions of the president. Either way, the subject of the elections cannot be glossed over and De Gaulle has to voice his ruling."

Of course this resonated with the long time gaullists, but with the nostalgic of the Résistance too. Strangely, this also pleased the belgian exiles, which status in Free France is still in question and which only waits for their return to the Plat-Pays.

This wasn't followed by a regular speech, Jean Gabin, standing on the podium of the scene, stayed silent for nearly 10 minutes, as the lights turned off and a movie started to roll behind him. Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, this film which takes inspiration from how the french lived in the 30s, was a short story about a policeman who were fired after a botched investigation, and moved from Paris to Corsica, a place from which he thought he could regain his reputation and become a cop again and go back to Paris to teach them how to do things right. However, during his "exile" it seems that he just became more bitter with time, eventually becoming the very person he fought years ago, a bandit fueled only by vangeance, forgetting his humanity and his morality.\n\nAfter this projection, the speech of Jean Gabin was of little importance to the press. Indeed, it was very obvious to a lot of intellectuals that this piece was just an allegory for De Gaulle and how his leadership drifted far from the ideals he defended 20 years ago. "Most of the leaders of the Nouvelle Vague party didn't know the life before Free France. The stories they heard, told by their parent, was most likely embellished with time, and as the young often do, they blindly believe in a false utopia" said the Journal de la France Libre, one of the most popular Free French newspaper."

The status of the Free French army, what will the new consitution be and the future of the Libération are the main contested points between the two candidates. Pierre Mendès-France stays firm on his ideals and his relationship with the Résistance, and his anti-De Gaulle rhetoric, while Maurice Schumann takes a more moderate approach on the politics of Free France, and while he doesn't agree with the Général's politics, he doesn't necessarely wants to amend ties with the Résistance, and wants to focus on their relationship with the OFN, and more specifically, with the United States.\n\nIn the end, 15 000 people watched the debate live on television, and 980 000 peoples, which only represent a quarter of the exiled population, have listened to the debate.

In some streets, the protest have grown up to 50 000 people, and the military police had to be sent to a few of them where the clashes between Ivorians and Exiles became too violent. After 3 days of protest, the leader of the Ivorian Democratic Front, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, was finally invited to the Palais du Gouverneur to talk with De Gaulle, but it seems like hours of discussion has led to nothing more than a promise of status-quo between the two people.\n\nIn this time where the Free French are eagerly waiting for the return of democracy, it seems like the Ivorians will not see the light of it for a long time."
