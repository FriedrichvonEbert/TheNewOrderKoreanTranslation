 UDM_speculation_and_accumulation_desc:0 "러시아는 가혹하고도 가혹한 곳입니다. 군벌이 흥하고 망하며, 정부가 집권하고 같은 날 무너집니다. 평범한 러시아인들은 이름 없는 군벌이 다스리는 땅에서 오두막에 살며 굶주립니다. 이러한 불행한 일들에도 불구하고 우리 무기 산업은 계속해서 부흥하고, 사람들은 일하고 봉사하기 위해 우리 국가로 몰려듭니다. 우리는 싸고 믿음직한 무기를 계속해서 찍어냅니다. 우리 산업은 어떤 일이 있더라고 흑자를 기록합니다. 우리 공화국은 시베리아 황무지라는 어둠 속에서 빛나는 등불입니다. 우리 시민들과 우리 산업이 번영하는 한 공화국은 번영할 것입니다. 하지만 성공적인 사업에 필요한 것 중 하나는 계획입니다. 서쪽의 물결이 불길하게 흐르고 있습니다. 제일 좋은 방법은 계획을 검토하고 우리 시민들과 고객들의 욕구를 채워주기 위해 뭘 해야 하나 알아보는 것입니다."

 UDM_stock_up:0 "Stock Up"
 UDM_stock_up_desc:0 "With so much conflict going on around us, we have constant orders of rifles, Anti Aircraft Guns, rockets, shells, and munitions to keep up with. While we are wildly successful, some cracks have begun to show in the foundation of our industry. The continuous flow of orders has been tough at times, and hundreds of workers and machines have been lost on the assembly line, simply because of exhaustion or mechanical failures. If the strain ever became too much our production slowed dramatically, the Republic would be lost, and the vultures around us would swoop in to take whatever we have left to offer. Stockpiling materials and weapons would make sure that we always have something to sell, and it would keep us supplied in the case that we would ever need to use our own weapons."

 UDM_the_frontlines:0 "The Frontlines"
 UDM_the_frontlines_desc:0 "Siberia is a brutal region. Only the strong survive, and only those like us who provide the tools for the strong to survive will prosper. We are surrounded by bandits, mercenaries, and the various fools who get enough guns and men to found a "nation". We do have several advantages however. Our working relationship with the Yugrans is extremely lucrative, and the Junta's that border us to the east are some of our best customers. Seeing that we have secured out place, it is time that the Republic consolidates its immediate vicinity and renegotiates some dealing with our current customers so we can keep our people safe and our profits high. The Republic will make sure that it's borders are safe, as who would want to pass through and do business with a nation full of vagrants and marauders?"

 UDM_flex_our_muscle:0 "Flex Our Muscle"
 UDM_flex_our_muscle_desc:0 "Some of our neighbors have been getting a bit bold with us. Payments are being delayed, the raids on the borders seem to be getting more and more frequent, and petty bandit gangs attempt to steal whatever weapons and ammunition they can from our stockpiles. The Republic needs to show those around it that we are not some warlord. We are a proud republic that is one of the few safe places in this harsh region. The Republic of Zlatoust is not to be trifled with, and we will keep our people safe and our bottom line intact no matter the cost."

 UDM_control_the_roads:0 "Control the Roads"
 UDM_control_the_roads_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe bombings, while very limited in our area due to our thriving anti-aircraft gun factory, still hit our roads, especially in the borderlands. Our roads and infrastructure is our most important aspect, and we need to rebuild what is destroyed and repave what has been worn down. To rebuild these roads, however, we will need money. One of supplementary sources of revenue is our toll system, but that also has some issues. It seems as if our tolls are being taken over and used by private citizens or they are being raided by bandits from our neighbors. Sending the police to guarantee the safety of our roads and funds will make sure that the Republic stays strong and secure, and it will make sure that we keep up with deliveries and such."

 UDM_the_yugra_connection:0 "The Yugra Connection"
 UDM_the_yugra_connection_desc:0 "The Republic has always had a good relationship with the Yugrans, but lately with the bandit raids and the mobs of brigands that have been crossing their border into ours, we have hit a rough patch. Sending the Republic's best diplomats will be a great way to reaffirm our good intentions and will hopefully allow us to discuss a new treaty. This proposed document would establish a mutual alliance between the Republic and Yugra, and along with various economic benefits, we would also agree to a treat of mutual defense. We need as many friends as we can get in this harsh world, and the Yugrans are our best bet."

 UDM_a_mercenary_state:0 "A Mercenary State"
 UDM_a_mercenary_state_desc:0 "Our glorious republic musters a small, but highly trained and exceptionally equipped army. However, with the deterioration of the situation in the west, and with many Warlords wanting to expand and even unify Russia, we need to increase our defensive capabilities. We have a limited manpower pool, so hiring Mercenaries, specifically from Yugra, wouldn't be a bad idea. By spending some coin to hire, equip, and house a group of mercenaries, we will keep our men out of combat unnecessarily and have an expandable force to police our borders and attack any bandits that try to steal from our stockpiles."

 UDM_pay_to_pass:0 "Pay to Pass"
 UDM_pay_to_pass_desc:0 "The Republic is a light in the darkness of Russia, and we offer what many warlords around can't: Stability, Safety, Prosperity, and Liberty. By showing those who surround us these benefits that we offer, we can increase immigration. This should be a priority, as more immigrants means more workers, more soldiers, more scientists, and more people to boost our population. The Republic needs to grow, and the more of our brethren that come in, the more we can grow and flourish in this wasteland. Propaganda leaflets and signs along our most traveled roadways would help convince travelers to stay in Zlatoust and contribute their skills to the Republic."

 UDM_free_to_stay:0 "Free to Stay"
 UDM_free_to_stay_desc:0 "Zlatoust has one of the most advanced and well kept infrastructure systems in all of Russia. We are a major transport hub of goods and people between the various warlords, and a good way to take advantage of our situation would be to open up our roads to other states, for a price of course. By allowing our neighbors to pay to pass through our area, we can have a source of constant, lucrative income for as long as trade continues, and perhaps entice some people to stay..."

 UDM_guns_for_the_men:0 "Guns for the Men"
 UDM_guns_for_the_men_desc:0 "The recent influx of new troops and mercenaries has led us to require more weapons to arm them. Our industry is struggling to keep up without sacrificing some of our other profitable production lines. Diverting our industry, for the short term at least, is the only solution we have. We will limit production of artillery rockets and tanks, and shift them over to the AK-47M. Another method we have, though it is more dubious, is to buy old weapons from various warlords, bandits, and vagrants who want to make a quick buck. It will be quicker but a large portion of our new recruits won't have their technological edge, and their firepower will be equivalent to most."

 UDM_theres_always_a_price:0 "Theres Always a Price"
 UDM_theres_always_a_price_desc:0 "As a beacon of capitalist spirit in Siberia, numerous corporations run weapons factories, without state owned manufacturers making the advanced weapons being the backbone of our economy. We normally let most companies proceed without intervention, but this time, something has gone wrong. One of our T-55 factories has fallen silent, as most warlords can't afford to use armor. Hundreds are out of work, but the government has a solution. We will buy the factory, retool it to make more profitable, and restore the jobs of the men and women who have been out of work."

 UDM_were_the_only_ones_selling_guns:0 "We're the Only Ones Selling Guns"
 UDM_were_the_only_ones_selling_guns_desc:0 "The Republic has been blessed with a vast amount of wood, steel, and technical knowledge, which allowed us to start our massive arms industry. The Luftwaffe rarely flies over our country, due to our vast Anti-Air defenses and the presence of the Free Aviators nearby. This has allowed us to consolidate our position and due to this, we have a monopoly over all of our neighbors, as no one makes the same quality weapons nor the same quantity of weapons that we do. Our reputation of cheap, rugged, and effective equipment draws buyers from across Russia. We have consolidated out position, and it is about time that we start to review our processes. We will take our profits and work on developing new rifles, tanks, and artillery pieces to enhance our portfolio, and improve our industrial methods so we can make our weapons faster and cheaper than anyone else can."

 UDM_the_siberian_mediator:0 "The Siberian Mediator"
 UDM_the_siberian_mediator_desc:0 "The Republic is well loved throughout Russia, though this more comes out of your business dealings than a genuine alliance. We are a neutral nation, and unlike the Front, the Tsar, or our neighbors to the east, The Republic has no desire to unify Russia. Our neutrality puts us in a unique position. By establishing offices and departments that communicate with other warlords, keeping them from destroying each other unnecessarily. It will also help our business, as if we allow warlords to make deals in our nation, with us serving of an arbitrator of sorts, we can skim off the top and make a tidy profit ourselves."

 UDM_the_bullish_charge:0 "The Bullish Charge"
 UDM_the_bullish_charge_desc:0 "Our Shining Republic is the only government of its kind in Western Siberia. We are surrounded by authoritarian governments, fiefdoms, and squabbling military men. A way for us to increase our immigration, and in turn our workforces, is to distribute leaflets and other forms of pro-government media to our citizens and the surrounding population, so they can see how and why we are a more wealthy, stable, and prosperous option in this cold and harsh world."

 UDM_dig_in:0 "Dig In"
 UDM_dig_in_desc:0 "We have no desire to reunify Siberia under our flag, let alone Russia. Our profits are made from conflict, and us staying out of said conflict. By increasing patrols, constructing forts, and increasing the size of our military, we will be able to protect the sovereignty of our shining republic from the various rabble-rousers around us, who want to loot our armories and plunder our wealth."

 UDM_sell_off_our_stock:0 "Sell Off Our Stock"
 UDM_sell_off_our_stock_desc:0 "The recent projects to improve the living standard of our citizens have sapped our treasury, and it would be a good idea to look into other forms of making money, other than selling our weapons to other nations. By selling out surplus weapons to private security firms we will be able to boost our earning conventionally, and by selling to some more... complex clients, we will be able to earn some money "off the books" as well."

 UDM_the_yugran_defense:0 "The Yugran Defense"
 UDM_the_yugran_defense_desc:0 "Us and our neighbors, the Yugrans, have common interests. We both seek to survive in the rough waters of Western Siberia, and we both want to fulfill our interests without meddling from other warlords with more conventional power. We will send one of the best diplomats in our republic to see if we can write an agreement of mutual defense, so both of our nations will be able to continue on our paths with a sense of security."

 UDM_fortify_zlatoust:0 "Fortify Zlatoust"
 UDM_fortify_zlatoust_desc:0 "Our republic's shining capital and industrial center are in a precarious position. While we are in the mountains, which is very defensible terrain, we border a significant amount of neighbors, and the best way to secure the safety and stability of the republic is to build up defenses in and around the city. Mines, bunkers, pillboxes and anti-tank guns will all be prepared and maintained so our citizens and workers and rest easy, knowing that they and their families are safe."

 UDM_the_all_russian_contractor:0 "The All-Russian Contractor"
 UDM_the_all_russian_contractor_desc:0 "Just because our republic doesn't seek to raise its flag over the Kremlin, doesn't mean that we do not want to show our influence in other ways. By offering our men and time to the petty bandit kings and old Soviet generals surrounding us, we can gain extra funds and we can give our men real combat experience, without exposing the republic to any of the conventional repercussions of war."

Every Machination of war, from the Kalashnikovs to the RPG-7s to the T-64s are being produced at a record rate and exported across the vast wastes of Russia. Our beacon of democracy provides a light in the darkness of this cold world. Now that we have secured the republic's position in the short term, it is time to look within our borders and focus on making further improvements to our people's daily lives and our profit margins."

 UDM_the_home_front:0 "The Home Front"
 UDM_the_home_front_desc:0 "Our citizens have better conditions than nearly any other Russian, barring the Tsars in the west and east, but that isn't saying much. While they are protected by the anti-aircraft guns that we produce, they are still victim to the occasional raid. While they do not live in the basic huts and bombed out buildings that many of their former countrymen reside in, they barely have any heat in the cold winter months, The Republic's efforts shall go to making sure that our constituents are happy, healthy, warm, well-fed and protected."

 UDM_double_our_portfolio_desc:0 "The industry of the Republic is already thriving, with guns and tanks being made in the dozens every day, but the republic is never satisfied with our profits, and for the betterment of our citizens and our coffers we shall seek to further improve our production methods. By investing a large amount of money to build new factories, procure new production equipment, and hire new workers, we will be able to exponentially grow the production capacity of the Republic. Our people will soon know a new age of prosperity and happiness, and this is just the start of our plans."

One part of the Republic's new initiative to increase goods production and living conditions of our citizens is to procure new equipment for our factories. By reaching out to fellow warlords, emigres, and foreign agents, the Republic will be able to secure new machines and ammunition to increase our production. This will increase our output capacity by leaps and bounds, which in turn will increase our profits by an even larger amount."

Profit margins are going up, equipment is being produced at a record rate and our citizens are happier and healthier than ever, but we can make some improvements. The Republic has vast stretches of land untouched by the hand of industry, and a way to further increase our profit is to start zoning off the land so we can construct Industrial Parks for the Republic. This creates additional jobs in terms of those who are clearing the land and those who are working in the factories, allowing the Republic's citizens to secure a livelihood."

 UDM_dynamic_revolution_desc:0 "The Republic is surrounded by despots, communists, and authoritarians. Their people are suffering under the boot of the oppressive regimes that rule over them, and it is in the Republic's best interest to engage in covert operations to further democracy. By arming insurgents in our neighbor's territory, we have a slight chance to weaken our neighbors, and the internal strife that is created will open up new markets for the Republic's weapons to be sold and used. The Republic stands for two things: profits and democracy, and these operations will make sure that both those things are fulfilled."

Dragunov has allowed us to use our investments in the state to build new statues, schools, museums and recreational centers for our people.

The West is a prime example: It is a sea of fire, populated by warlords who place more value on dead ideologies than their own people.

Refugees flock to Zlatoust by the hundreds, fleeing the wrath of madmen, who swim like sharks around the mountain home, eager to rip it apart at any moment.\n\nRumours speak of giant caves, filled to the brim with intact weaponry and heavy equipment, enough to give their owner the edge against any force in Siberia. Unfortunately, there are also those who try to divine the root of Zlatoust's unnatural prosperity. Indeed, for every bag of wheat and valuables traded into the mountains, there emerge trucks loaded with rifles, heading towards the domain of bandits.

A scout detachment was dispatched, who confirmed the private's report: A large group of unmarked soldiers had camped near XXXXXX woods, for what appears to be a military exercise. They shot at target dummies from a range of ~400 meters, and practiced hand-to-hand combat with one another in the evening.\n\nIt is my firm belief that this was not another roving band of mercenaries, as these soldiers exemplified discipline... but most importantly wielded modern weaponry. Private XXXXXXX had flanked this group, hoping to spy on it from the other side of the forest. Although I cannot confirm his reports, he swears that he also saw a fully-functioning tank, maybe even some trucks hidden in the foliage.

For a moment, Jaba thought that a mocking smile flashed across the head merchant's face. He gazed at the mountain trucks, equipped to pass through any kind of blizzard, while he, the most successful bandit in all of Russia, had to arrive on a horse.\n\nThe merchants had brought out three dozen crates of rifles, bullets, and some combat knives for the chiefs. Jaba took one of the guns, an old AK-47: its barrel was battered, but could get the job done. He turned his head and nodded to the bandits. They grabbed the crates and carried them off, not unlike how a vulture feasts on the scraps left by a fierce predator. In turn, some footpads emerged from a nearby bush with heavy sacks across their shoulders. They deposited these into the mountain trucks, then disappeared back into the woods.\n\nThe head trader returned a dry smile, reached into his overcoat and produced a letter. Jaba took it, but before he could open the seal the merchants had already started their engines.\n\nThe head trader yelled out: 'Zlatoust appreciates this deal, and we hope that many more will follow.

Two dozen men emerged, armed with modern assault-rifles and sporting gas masks never before seen in Siberia.\n\n'We have come to see comrade Jaba!' yelled one of the soldiers as he flung the gun over his shoulder.\n\n'I'm Jaba.' The bandit shoved some footpads aside as he made his way through the mud. The meeting wasn't supposed to happen until next week, but Jaba found himself worried for the first time in many months. This base is supposed to be secret - how did the merchants know about it?

Troops emerged from the back of the front truck, carrying crates decorated with the symbol of death.\n\n'Mr. Ioseliani, here we have two hundred units of Kalashnikovs, one-hundred and fifty, grenades, and the last five trucks are yours.' Jaba looked at the end of the caravan, a hungry fire burned in his eye. He raised his hand and a pack of mules emerged from the foliage, loaded with sacks of grain. The head merchant raised his eyebrows and stared at the animals, then drew a heavy breath and looked back at Jaba.\n\nDammit. The bandit raised his other hand, some footpads loaded the goods onto the merchants' trucks. 'This is all I can spare right now, comrade.' explained Jaba, 'but come back next week and we'll have more.'\n\nThe man from Zlatoust looked up at the morning sky, as if considering his options, then slowly spoke: 'My associates believe that, for our business to continue into the future, there must be complete trust between our two parties.' He pointed to the nearby wood, 'We would like the rest, please.' Jaba turned around and caught a car mirror sticking out from behind a pine, the sun's rays bouncing off it. He groaned and motioned for his men to come out.\n\nAn engine roared to life, and an old truck emerged from the forest. The Head Merchant grinned back at Jaba as his men proceeded to loot the last of the camp's provisions.

So, when the merchants arrived, Jaba emerged from his hut, flanked by four guards, armed to the teeth with the most intimidating (and inefficient) equipment he could scavenge. It was a surprise when a single truck pulled into camp, and out came a single merchant, not of death but of opportunity. He seemed to sing when he spoke, yet his voice somehow managed to maintain integrity and directness. Jaba could only listen as the man made outrageous demands in exchange for nearly trivial promises, but portrayed them in such a way that would make a king understand. However, the deal boiled down to this:\n\nThe bandits are a brave bunch, but lack the numbers to protect their territories (and loot) properly. True, thought Jaba, there are occasional reports of thieves stealing from thieves.

We've been waiting for months for these weapons, and you've doomed us in our wait. The men and women of Russia will here about the fucking "business" racket of Zlatoust, Mr. Dragunov!"\n\n"Hello, hello?" With the furious cry at the end of the call, the phone line was cut silent.\n\nDamnit. Another lost customer. Mayor-Consul Yevgeny Dragunov threw his chair back as it hit the ground with a solid thud, and ran over to the window of his office. Across the land, the Mayor-Consul looked over his hardworking people, toiling away in their businesses, earning a hefty profit from all the warring of the Russian lands. It was only by the good grace of God that they had not known of the four missed shipments, starving the regime of necessary funds. Truly, Zlatoust would not be known as "golden-mouthed" for much longer should a solution not be found quickly by Mayor-Consul Dragunov."

 zlatoust_sales.6.desc:0 "The burning wastes of a former storage house billowed with smoke against the white winter morning. Another group of bandits broken through the wall, with guns and bombs and bullets they so desperately needed, taking everything they could haul and burning it all behind them. Including the twelve guardsmen who stood to defend their homes, their wives, their families. "Put me on the line with Dragunov." Colonel Utkin said, steely, as the winter morning air puffed the words out in front of him.\n\n"Thirty rifles is what we ordered, Mayor-Consul Dragunov. Thirty. Rifles."\n\n"It was the grave error of several incompetent chains in the command of the businesses here in Zlatoust, Mr. Utkin, they've since been removed from their positions and we may continue our transacti-"\n\n"No fucking deal, Dragunov.

We've been waiting for months for these weapons, and you've doomed us in our wait. The men and women of Russia will here about the fucking "business" racket of Zlatoust, Mr. Dragunov!"\n\nIt was going to be a long night. Colonel Utkin knew it was no use to try and avoid the business deal with Dragunov, and that, eventually, his village was going to have to submit to Zlatoust's business venturian ways and make them sit, wait, and bleed. Now, all he could pray for was the day where Russians did not slaughter one another in the forest to come sooner."

 zlatoust_sales.7.desc:0 "Men shouted in the distance, retreating from the patch of trees and shrubbery handpicked by Colonel Utkin. That early morning, the few stars peaking through the rising sun's glare alongside the gentle falling snowflakes were not strong enough to pierce beauty through the grizzly sight of a blood-stained forest, as cloudy mists of Russian blood sprayed through the trees. There, deep within the Russian wilderness, Colonel Utkin found himself alive. His men, alive. And every single would-be marauder of his fine homestead and village on the run, or lying dead in the snow. Everyone stood silent, taking in their first victory in months, their first chance to make a stand against the Russian attacker who so greatly pillaged their lands for so long. The men threw down their rifles, hugged one another, and cheered to the heavens over their newfound victory against the murderous thieves who plagued them for so long. Colonel Utkin, however, took a minute to inspect the bodies. Boys, the least of which must have been sixteen. A prime age for cadets before the rise of the Soviets, perhaps, but the cold, lifeless eyes reminded him of that day when Russia would war no longer.\n\nCheers and cries greeted the party of guards as they entered their settlement once again, this time having tasted their first victory against the men who tore their land asunder for so long. However, whilst the rest of the men enjoyed family and the taverns, Colonel Utkin made his way up to his office, readying himself to congratulate the man truly in charge of their victory. Spinning the rotary, Colonel Utkin awaited.\n\n"Yes, Mayor-Consul Dragunov? This is Colonel Utkin. I wished to report the lives you saved with your most recent transaction with our government...""
