 IBR.1.t:0 "1962년 인프라 프로그램"
 IBR.1.d:0 "연말이 다가옴에 따라 드디어 새로운 인프라 확장 계획을 발표할 때가 되었습니다. 이것의 시작은 소규모의 개선 작업으로, 이를 통해 연합에서의 우리의 경제구조를 포괄적으로 개선시킬 수 있을 것입니다. 올해 계획의 하이라이트는 마드리드 외곽에 새로 건설될 준 주요 도로로, 카우디요 프랑코 또한 큰 관심을 보이고 있습니다. 듣기로는 그가 이미 수많은 작업현장을 시찰하였고 정기적으로 건설작업을 점검하고 있다고 합니다.\n\n하지만 낙관적인 연합 관리들은 위 계획에 들뜬 나머지 포르투갈 사회에 가득찬 불만을 알아채지 못한 것 같습니다. 포르투갈의 많은 지역의 도로는 보수가 절실한 상황이며, 수도에서 수백마일 떨어진 도로는 운이 좋을 경우 적은 양의 자금만 지원받을 것이며 최악의 경우 그냥 방치될 것으로 보입니다. 하지만 프로젝트 관련자들은 분리주의 테러리스트를 감시하기 위해 대규모 보안대가 배치되어 있기 때문에 프로젝트를 무사히 끝마칠 수 있을 것이라 확신하고 있습니다. 더욱 중요한 것은 이 프로젝트가 연합 전역의 인프라에 미칠 잠재적 영향을 이들이 인식하고 있다는 것입니다."
 IBR.1.a:0 "그렇게 되길 바라자..."

 IBR.2.t:0 "마드리드 외곽순환도로 제안"
 IBR.2.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the new flagship infrastructure plan has hit the same filter of survival that most policy proposals hit once both halves of the ever-bickering union has access to information regarding them. Angry invoices and incessant phone calls to the Ministry of the Interior in Madrid were all of the same nature, a rejection of the plan to start construction on the proposed highway outside of the Spanish capital because of another trivial matter. The matter of the tools being used not being exactly proportional in terms of national origin. This obstacle has the potential to freeze the Iberian domestic arm of the government if not truly addressed; thus, we have to options to consider for going forward."
 IBR.2.a:0 "포르투갈 건설장비를 더 많이 사용하자."
 IBR.2.b:0 "Bribe them with a matching road in Lisbon."

 IBR.3.t:0 "아스팔트 혼합물"
 IBR.3.d:0 " 새로운 인프라 프로젝트가 계획 단계부터 진통을 겪고 있는데, 이는 어느 꼼꼼한 포르투갈 공무원이 아스팔트 혼합물에 관한 스페인과 포르투갈의 관련 규정이 서로 다르다는 것을 눈치챔으로 인한 것 같습니다. 아무런 개입 없이 추가 작업을 계속할 경우 도로를 망가뜨릴 가능성이 있습니다. 프로젝트가 두 연합 구성원들간의 협력의 결과물이 될 것이라는 것을 고려할 때 우리는 한 치의 오차도 허용해선 안될 것입니다. 다시 말하지만 이는 단지 도로일 뿐이며, 이후에는 더 대규모의 프로젝트가 진행될 것이며 결국엔 이베리아의 안정화에 도움이 될 것입니다. 이 문제를 어떻게 처리해야 할까요?"
 IBR.3.a:0 "이곳은 스페인 땅이니 스페인 법을 따라야 한다."
 IBR.3.b:0 "도로 건설 자재에 관한 연방법을 따르자."
 IBR.3.c:0 "왜 규정이 필요하지? 우리가 가져온 자재를 사용하자."

 IBR.4.t:0 "The Question of Repairs"
 IBR.4.d:0 "With the asphalt mixture problem resolved and the investigation underway, we have been given the go-ahead to start our project. State sanctioned contractors are beginning to arrive in droves, already making great progress as they begin to tear out defunct infrastructure to implement the new great works. Both foreign and domestic journalists gasp in awe when they get their allotted time to visit the construction sites; a process requiring a great deal of effort and delay on our part as everything has to be prepared accordingly in advance.\n\nOn one such visit everything changed however, time coming to a freezing halt as a blood curdling scream tears down the perfect visage we created.\n\nAn explosion of asphalt ruptures the now trembling earth, exposing cracks within the hardly setting concrete. Swathes of road cratered in after tons of dynamite were preemptively detonated in the foundations of an interchange, reducing days of toil into rubble and ash. Large stockpiles of resources and machinery are lost in the horrific mess. Emergency services were deployed within minutes, tending to wounds and attempting to pull grasping, bloodied hands out of the charred piles of ruin. We have confirmed four deaths and over three hundred workers injured, adding costly medical bills to the already colossal repairs we need to immediately address.\n\nAfter the cry of "Bietan jarrai!" was reported during the chaos, we have strong evidence supporting the notion that Basque separatists belonging to socialist organizations are directly responsible for the attacks, based off reports of similar terrorist activities that have plagued other government sponsored public works. The SECD has begun an investigation to address our suspicions, but in the meantime, we need to figure out how to amend or adjust our budget to deal with this shortfall. How should we recover from this disaster?"
 IBR.4.a:0 "Ask for a grant of Spanish tax money."
 IBR.4.b:0 "Ask for a grant of Iberian tax money."
 IBR.4.c:0 "Cut corners - we can save material here and there."

 IBR.5.t:0 "조사"
 IBR.5.d:0 "After the bureaucratic nightmare that was finding the necessary funds for the desperately-needed repairs, it seems as if we may at last proceed. The many confused workmen were finally allowed back onsite, the immense amount of resources again made available, and the heavy machinery was driven out of storage.\n\nIf only it were so simple.\n\nIn the early hours of the first morning of official repairs, the construction site was suddenly swarmed with mysterious men in dark suits, who quickly cordoned off the area and hustled several of the foremen into black vans before ordering the workers to vacate the site immediately. When the regional governor's office received a phone call from one of the contractors explaining what had happened, he was furious. However, that tone was dampened by the arrival of several SECED agents bringing... less-than-ideal news.\n\nThey had already identified the people responsible for the bombings: a group of radicalized Basque students-turned-separatists with leftist leanings. Their ringleader was one Iñigo Nuñez, cousin of Alfredo Nuñez... one of the foremen for a contractor hired on the project. SECED has reasons to believe that Alfredo may have aided his cousin's terrorist cell in organizing the bombing, and that he was not the only one operating on the inside. They have obtained an official warrant to fully investigate and audit all the contractors we have hired, in order to vet them for any other associates of Alfredo who may share his separatist ideology. In the meantime, all road work must be halted for the duration of the investigation, effective immediately to make sure no further damage can be inflicted on the already controversy stricken project."
 IBR.5.a:0 "Are you really- are you KIDDING ME?!"

 IBR.6.t:0 "Lane Expansion?"
 IBR.6.d:0 "The project should've been simple. It should've just been a two lane road going from point A to point B. Yet sadly nothing can be that simple, these are turbulent times for Iberia, a political union where the building of a road is vastly outdone in effort just by the timescale of getting everything about said road approved with multiple administrations. Every little thing must bear with it fifty clauses and a hundred subsections, as though the mix of the pavement itself could potentially spark an inter-ethnic conflict were it not for corpulent bureaucracy that keeps us moving at a snail's pace.\n\nThe government in Madrid has now become involved in the construction of the road, and with it comes an entirely other magnitude of legislature and administration. The bombing of the road has forced us to create an extra-wide shoulder to be able to actually get equipment around the crater left by said attack. Madrid is now demanding that we turn this shoulder into an entirely new lane. They either have no idea what they're asking for, or, more likely, they don't care.\n\nThis is a case for the federal government. You would have to file a pile's worth of appeal paperwork asking for a permit to actually alter the road we're working on, and then of course there's a lengthy waiting period all just so a committee of pencil pushers and nepotists can take a quick glance at the paperwork and grant or deny your requests on what feels like a whim. Madrid's ignorance of the realities in the ground are mind-numbing. We can't just turn a larger than average shoulder into an entirely new lane! The shoulder would have to be expanded, the budget would have to be reconsidered, and we'd just fall once more into the seemingly endless abyss of bureaucracy we've been dealing with for the past months."
 IBR.6.a:0 "Accept the request, and appeal to the federal government."
 IBR.6.b:0 "Decline the request, to hell with the city government."

 IBR.7.t:0 "Construction Planning Finalized"
 IBR.7.d:0 "After a long period of bureaucratic delays and general pitfalls it seems that the construction of the outer Madrid road is finally proceeding smoothly. Senior contractors and civil servants have created multiple detailed models which all currently project it to all be finished in several months allowing us to finally move onto other, more grand parts of our infrastructure overhaul project."
 IBR.7.a:0 "Let's hope it's really several months."

 IBR.8.t:0 "Portugal Vetoes Construction Regulations"
 IBR.8.d:0 "The small motorcade of Portuguese officials meandering through Madrid's old roads carried with it another message bound to cause disarray. Their national government has very foolishly decided to veto our request to use Spanish law instead of Portuguese laws when determining the acceptable mixture of asphalt for the construction of the outer Madrid road.\n\nTheir decision is supposedly based on technical difficulties with the sand and gravel mixtures but any politically savvy individual could clearly see that it is rather another attempt to defy Iberian centralization with lesser Portuguese characteristics, even on a small matter such as this. They would have us work less efficiently and with a higher cost rather than swallow their pride and admit that other parts of the Union might just have better laws! To remedy the construction deadlock this will create we will have to find a way around this ruling. There is always a loose screw or a bad apple in the bunch, and if we can find them and "convince" them to look the other way, then we will still end up saving a very good amount of time, money, and effort. We will just have to make sure that these less savory actions are not discovered by anyone else."
 IBR.8.a:0 "Do it. Bribe the officials."

 IBR.9.t:0 "Permit Alteration Accepted"
 IBR.9.d:0 "The proposed alteration to our construction permit has been accepted by the federal government, and we are once again cleared to begin work. The new road will now have the desired amount of lanes wanted by the Madrid city administration. "
 IBR.9.a:0 "A miracle!"

 IBR.10.t:0 "Spain Denies Permit"
 IBR.10.d:0 "The Spanish national government has declined our request to alter the construction permit, stating that the city government has no right to make requests that would fundamentally change the new flagship union project. We will not be able to expand the lanes."
 IBR.10.a:0 "At least it saves money."

 IBR.11.t:0 "Portugal Denies Permit"
 IBR.11.d:0 "The Portuguese government has unfortunately decided to deny our request to alter the construction permit to fit more lanes onto the current flagship infrastructure project outside of Madrid. They claim that a municipal government such as ours has neither the ability nor the right to make these kinds of major changes to a project that so clearly falls under federal jurisdiction. This not only means that there will not be any lane expansions but it also sets a decidedly chilly mood for future negotiations on the project. Despite our proximity to the infrastructure and therefore the heightened fallout whether positive or negative for us, we can now only hope that they will be more reasonable in the future when it comes to the project, as it seems any further involvement on our part is being opposed at high government levels." 
 IBR.11.a:0 "At least it saves money."

 IBR.12.t:0 "Conflict of Interest Investigation"
 IBR.12.d:0 "Another hardship fell onto the contractors and bureaucrats involved with the 1962 infrastructure overhaul plan, which has already been the target of controversy. Senior officials in the domestic office of government, particularly those concerned with optics and propaganda, have begun to take a more intense interest in the proceedings of the road construction. Allegations of misused and downright embezzled funds, overworked laborers and withheld pay are being thundered down on the already shaking shoulders of the hard pressed overseers. The duality of work objectives and optics seems to have come to its natural conclusion, a direct conflict of interests. Whether this scandal will halt the project indefinitely is yet to be revealed by the machinations of the wise Iberian government." 
 IBR.12.a:0 "Since when did Iberia care about corruption?"

 IBR.13.t:0 "Violation of Material Regulations"
 IBR.13.d:0 "A surprise inspection has discovered that we have not been obeying established regulations regarding the asphalt mixture to be used on the road. The Iberian government has fined us for said mistake, stating that only the best and agreed upon quality was allowed to persist in any further construction work. Why government employed workers were being fined by the government for I competency outside their pay grade was still to be found out."
 IBR.13.a:0 "Corruption is to be expected."

 IBR.14.t:0 "Federal Tax Money Proposal"
 IBR.14.d:0 "Our request for more federal tax money to be used for repairing the road has been finally been accepted by officials both in Madrid and Lisbon. Our constructions can now hopefully continue and eventually finish without any further delay." 
 IBR.14.a:0 "Thank goodness."

 IBR.15.t:0 "스페인의 세금 제안"
 IBR.15.d:0 "세금을 도로 관리에 사용하도록 하는 우리의 제안을 스페인 지방정부가 받아들였습니다. 이는 마침내 이 저주받은 프로젝트가 끝나고 다시 일터로 돌아갈 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다."
 IBR.15.a:0 "훌륭하군."

 IBR.16.t:0 "이베리아가 자금 지원을 거부하다"
 IBR.16.d:0 "이베리아 연방 정부는 도로 건설에 대한 추가 자금 지원을 거부하면서, 충분한 자금이 이미 여기에 지원되었다고 덧붙였습니다. 비참한 폭탄 테러에 대한 그들의 폭넓은 지식에도 불구하고 그들은 이러한 결정을 내렸습니다. 우리는 자금 조달을 위해 다른 방법을 찾아야 합니다."
 IBR.16.a:0 "예상대로군."

 IBR.17.t:0 "스페인이 자금 지원을 거부하다"
 IBR.17.d:0 "스페인 지방 정부는 이 프로젝트가 연방의 역할이라 말하면서 일을 크게 만드는 것은 지방정부들 간의 내부 분쟁을 야기할 것이라 덧붙였습니다. 우리는 다른 자금원을 찾아야 할 것입니다."
 IBR.17.a:0 "그들의 간섭으로부터 자유로워지고 싶군."

 IBR.18.t:0 "도로 건설이 완료되다"
 IBR.18.d:0 "Finally, after many incidents and delays, the proposed road in outer Madrid is now usable. This will be the first stepping stone in providing Iberia with a logistical infrastructure system that will bring the half-peninsula the capabilities to flex its eager muscles on the international market. One question remains however... who will open it, and who will it be named after? This may not be an easy issue to solve."
 IBR.18.a:0 "Not this again!"

 IBR.190.t:0 "Portuguese Mechanical Failures"
 IBR.190.d:0 "The less experienced labourers at the road construction site this morning were surprised to see all machines that had used the concrete mixture were in a state beyond repair. The older, arguably more wiser men shook their heads in knowing disbelief. It seems the Portuguese machines that we were mandated to use apparently are incompatible with the required paving mixture, and have suffered numerous mechanical failures. They must be swapped out if we are to finish this project. "
 IBR.190.a:0 "Who even makes those?"

 IBR.19.t:0 "City Government Cuts Off Movement!"
 IBR.19.d:0 "The city government of Madrid, after having their request declined, has denied construction teams a permit to move construction equipment through the city. Thankfully, the federal government is already moving to overturn this, but this still means there will be a significant delay in continuing further construction. "
 IBR.19.a:0 "More delays?"

 IBR.20.t:0 "Government Approves Using Spanish Law"
 IBR.20.d:0 "The Iberian government has approved using the asphalt mixtures and road measurements standardized in Spanish law for the Outer Madrid road."
 IBR.20.a:0 "Surprising, but acceptable."

 IBR.21.t:0 "Investigation Finds Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.21.d:0 "The investigation into the Outer Madrid road project has found several suspicious practices, including fraud, bribery and a neglect of proper vetting procedures for employees. A heavy fine is being drafted for the road-building company to try to minimize mitigating damage to the government. The issue of further dragging the project on is hardly even being considered at this point."
 IBR.21.a:0 "It Could Be Worse."

 IBR.22.t:0 "Investigation Finds Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.22.d:0 "The investigation into the Outer Madrid road project has found many suspicious practices, including bribing officials and a foreman with active ties to Basque separatists. The Guardia Civil have raided the site and arrested the suspect."
 IBR.22.a:0 "Unacceptable Behavior."

 IBR.23.t:0 "Investigation Finds Very Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.23.d:0 "The investigation into the Outer Madrid road project has found many suspicious practices, the most notable of which is finding out that one of the companies involved was a front for a southern Italian-based organized crime family. Considering the initial benign nature of the investigation it is surprising to now see the Iberian government having a minor international incident on their hands."
 IBR.23.a:0 "How did they get away with it?"

 IBR.24.t:0 "Investigation Finds No Suspicious Activity"
 IBR.24.d:0 "Despite the numerous setbacks facing it, the Outer Madrid road project has been deemed a safe and law-abiding enterprise. It is a good example to all of Iberia in how the rest of the planned infrastructure overhauls should be organised."
 IBR.24.a:0 "An Excellent Example."

 IBR.25:0 "The Lisbon Infrastructure Plan"
 IBR.25.t:0 "The Lisbon Infrastructure Plan"
 IBR.25.d:0 "Planned years ago in 1962, the Lisbon Infrastructure Plan has finally been completed. Lisbon now possesses a sister road to the one in Madrid."
 IBR.25.a:0 "Finally."
 
 #Post-malta debates
 
 IBR.27:0 "Trade Debate - Triumvirate Tariffs"
 IBR.27.t:0 "Trade Debate - Triumvirate Tariffs"
 IBR.27.d:0 "With the collapse of the Triumvirate, many of Iberia's former trade partners have suddenly declared themselves hostile to the nation. Today, in their meeting in Galicia, the two Caudillos discussed the possibility of levying tariffs on Italy and Turkey. While they generally agreed that tariffs were a decent idea, the discussion was quickly bogged down by furious argument over exactly what products had the highest priority to levy tariffs on. Spanish and Portuguese institutions both provided conflicting data, much of which was severely out of date. Once the dust settled, no comprehensive agreement had been reached."
 IBR.27.a:0 "Can't they agree on anything?"
 
 IBR.28:0 "Trade Debate - Tariff Sourcing"
 IBR.28.t:0 "Trade Debate - Tariff Sourcing"
 IBR.28.d:0 "With the utter indecision of the previous debate, the Caudillos have moved on to a new topic. Namely, precisely where the money from potential tariffs would go. Again, a consensus was not reached, with precise ratios not being worked out. The issue of the Union government not recieving any sort of reasonable amount of funding appears to be likely to persist indefinitely, as the Caudillos clash over what factors shall determine which administration will collect and distribute tariff money."
 IBR.28.a:0 "We needed that!"
 
 IBR.29:0 "Trade Debate - Port Ownership"
 IBR.29.t:0 "Trade Debate - Port Ownership"
 IBR.29.d:0 "After the disastrous attempt at negotiating tariffs, the Caudillos have taken another topic in to be tormented. The matter of the day is now port ownership, namely the question of which administration owns national ports. While Salazar insists that regional governments should be in control of the ports, Franco argues that all ports should be under the direct control of the Union itself. After nearly three hours of argument, the decision was unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion, and has thus been delayed until the next meeting. Until then, Iberia's ports shall be held in uncertain hands."
 IBR.29.a:0 "At least it wasn't something more important."
 
 IBR.30:0 "Trade Debate - Railway Gauge"
 IBR.30.t:0 "Trade Debate - Railway Gauge"f
 IBR.30.d:0 "The final topic in the Caudillo's hellish trade conference is the matter of railroad gauge. Certain obscure railroads in inner Spain are unable to support railroad cars wide enough to hold standardized shipping containers. Thus, Franco argues, federal funding must be granted to expand the railroad tracks to a regulation length. Salazar, however, does not agree, stating that shipping maritime containers through inland Spain is useless, when containers could simply be unloaded and processed on Portuguese soil. The esoteric argument managed to last longer than any other, and end in bitter indecision."
 IBR.30.a:0 "Was Iberia meant to be this dysfunctional?"
 
 IBR.31:0 "Taxation Debate - Foreign Taxation"
 IBR.31.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Foreign Taxation"
 IBR.31.d:0 "The conference on taxation has begun with the most crucial item on the list, namely, taxing foreign assets. Iberia, due to its weak federal tax code, has a reputation as a tax haven equitable to the worst of the West Indies. In this debate, several schools of thought have clashed, with some arguing to end Iberia's status as a de facto tax haven, while others believe that any taxation at all will lower investments and make the country worse off than it started. In the end, no side prevailed, as Caudillos Franco and Salazar were split on the issue of potential tax discrimination by country of origin."
 IBR.31.a:0 "That was important..."
 
 IBR.32:0 "Taxation Debate - Income Taxation"
 IBR.32.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Income Taxation"
 IBR.32.d:0 "Another dreaded topic of discussion was the potential of a federal income tax. While it has general support amongst the Opus Dei economists recently allowed into the government, the Caudillos are still bitterly split on the issue. Salazar, ever the corporatist, refuses to agree with any sort of concrete estimate on a tax amount or collection mechanism. Thus, once more, an idea sinks into the pits of Iberian government and is forever lost."
 IBR.32.a:0 "An absurd display."
 
 IBR.33:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Distribution"
 IBR.33.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Distribution"
 IBR.33.d:0 "The grand debate on taxation has finally come around to where, precisely, the money from a federal tax would go. There are numerous proposals, such as corporate subsidies, business stimulus, the Gibraltar Dam, and military expansion. However, neither party is willing to give up on their own interests. As the fifth day of debate concludes, the only concession made is a solitary funding break for increasing the budget of the Moroccan police force."
 IBR.33.a:0 "That was a necessary consensus!"
 
 IBR.34:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Collection Authority"
 IBR.34.t:0 "Taxation Debate - Federal Tax Collection Authority"
 IBR.34.d:0 "As with all things in Iberia, the worst has yet to come, for now is the time to debate the federal tax collection authority. For reasons related to regional autonomy, this issue has been heavily debated, and a conclusion was unable to be reached.\n\nA conclusion was still not reached. Equal expansion of Spanish and Portuguese tax collection agencies was shot down by Salazar, as the change would require cross-regional jurisdiction to be given to tax collectors purchasing regionally taxed goods in the other region. A strong federal tax authority was also shot down, as it was determined to not have enough force backing it up in the case of tax evasion. Due to this gridlock, the tiny tax collection agency of Iberia will remain dysfunctional..."
 IBR.34.a:0 "The absurd becomes the usual."
 
 IBR.35:0 "Military Debate - Military Training Funding"
 IBR.35.t:0 "Military Debate - Military Training Funding"
 IBR.35.d:0 "In general, while our militaries are fairly overfunded, our training sector is extremely weak. Routinely, there is not enough ammunition to properly be used in training camps, and shot-count limitations have to be imposed on trainees. This issue was brought up between the Caudillos, and miraculously passed - almost. An issue with funding for various training camps being biased towards Spanish locations lead to the infamous Portuguese veto being applied, and a furious bout of argument in the chamber. Franco accused Salazar of wanting the Germans to be able to take Iberia easily, and nearly had to be restrained physically."
 IBR.35.a:0 "As if there wasn't enough tension already."
 
 IBR.36:0 "Military Debate - Funding Allocation"
 IBR.36.t:0 "Military Debate - Funding Allocation"
 IBR.36.d:0 "The state of the Iberian Army is objectively awful. That, no party can deny. However, when the time comes to potentially resolve that, the consensus breaks down.\n\nToday, in A Coruña, the negotiations for increased funding to the Iberian Army broke down in spectacular fashion, as bickering military commanders from the Spanish and Portuguese Armies flooded the stage with papers stating that their funding was far more important. As the Caudillos accept these claims, it appears that the Iberian Army shall once more be sidelined."
 IBR.36.a:0 "Hopefully, the Germans won't invade any time soon."
 
 IBR.37:0 "Military Debate - Standard Equipment"
 IBR.37.t:0 "Military Debate - Standard Equipment"
 IBR.37.d:0 "With the state of the Iberian army out of the way, the time has come to review the army equipment. Since the end of the Second World War, Spain's main weapons providers were Germany and Italy, and with the formation of the Iberian Union, it's clear that Spain cannot keep relying on Germany despite the success of the Bär Program of 1943.\n\nHowever, Italy is not in the best position to continue supplying our under-equipped army, and many officers from both armies have stated their opinions on the subject, with two clear major groups coming out on top in the discussions. One of them advocates for the continuation of Italian weapon imports for as long as they can be relied on, and then switching to another major weapons producer if necessary, and another faction advocating for the expansion of the rather small Spanish Arms industry, mainly based around small-time workshops rather than fully blown companies for now. As the Caudillos analyze their options, it is clear that continuing imports it's the simplest and cheapest solution."
 IBR.37.a:0 "Let's hope the Italians still have their guns on the cheap."
 
 IBR.38:0 "Military Debate - Drill Sergeant Language"
 IBR.38.t:0 "Military Debate - Drill Sergeant Language"
 IBR.38.d:0 "With the many attempts of standarizing the army drills, a major issue has been brought up to the Caudillos: The many recruits don't speak the same language as their squadmates from different regions.\n\nThis has sparked a debate on whether or not the soldiers should be split into squads from the same region with separate drill instructors, with the support of Salazar, or trying to maintain and reinforce the current system which tries to force bilingualism through down to a squad level, which is advocated by Franco after his attempts of unifying the culturally diverse Spanish Army during the Spanish Civil War. As neither seems to budge on their position, it seems like the status quo will continue."
 IBR.38.a:0 "Well, at least the drill will be educative for those who only speak one language."
 
 IBR.39:0 "Minorities Debate - Anti-Separatist Agency"
 IBR.39.t:0 "Minorities Debate - Anti-Separatist Agency"
 IBR.39.d:0 "The Iberian Union currently enforces total equality between the two forming states, Spain and Portugal. This however, forgets one of the most basic issues that Spain has to deal with since its inception, and that's the split between the very different and even opposing cultural groups that form Spain as a country in the first place. Many of those groups, like the Basques or the Galicians saw the Portuguese as a separate entity for centuries, but now that they're all in the same union and the Portuguese are given special treatment while they are still treated as part of the heavily Castillean-dominated Spain where they feel their desires are not represented, rallies and riots against the government have become common throughout the years.\n\nThis is turning more and more into a large issue as many regions have seceded in the past, with an attempt of the Basque and Catalonia to break off in the 30s, and those attempts have both Caudillos worried that further separatism may break the Union apart. With their combined effort, they have devised a new institution for Spain, the 'Axencia Anti-Separatista' which will answer directly to them and will deal mostly with discrediting propaganda and direct supression of separatist movements."
 IBR.39.a:0 "Unbelievable that they agree for once."
 
 IBR.40:0 "Minorities Debate - African Languages"
 IBR.40.t:0 "Minorities Debate - African Languages"
 IBR.40.d:0 "With the growth of our African possessions after the Second World War, we are now faced with the rather difficult challenge of integrating the regions into our mighty country. One of the first and obvious issues is the status of the African languages in them. Iberia currently owns large regions with Tamazight, Shilha, Rifian and Seghrouchni Berber-Arab sub-languages, which are clearly incompatible with the latin Spanish and Portuguse languages.\n\nBoth Caudillos argue harshly on this, as both countries have had very different colonial policies in the past in regards to language. Salazar argues that the Union should enforce the language policy of the Portuguese Empire, forcing Portuguese through all stages of public life for the colonies, while Franco argues for the Spanish Colonial approach where natives can keep their languages but can only hold public posts and take part in their local government if they speak Spanish. Both Caudillos are pushing for their languages and in the end, the discussion turned so rabid that the final result was a simple, but at the same time, underwhelming compromise: Both languages will be taught in the region, and the administration will be handled in bilingually in order to encourage its their, but it will also try to push for both to be used in the private sphere."
 IBR.40.a:0 "Two administrative languages? Let's hope this doesn't bite us in the long run."
 
 IBR.41:0 "Minorities Debate - Iberian Minority Languages"
 IBR.41.t:0 "Minorities Debate - The Status of Iberian Minority Languages"
 IBR.41.d:0 "The Iberian minority languages are the strange result of artificial kingdoms and caliphates being slowly integrated into Castille-Aragón, causing the Iberian peninsula to be a complete linguistic mess where two provinces can hardly communicate with each other without the help of Castilian Spanish. However, many people in these regions cannot communicate in Portuguese as well as they can in Castilian Spanish, and it's slowly turning into a huge issue as both Spain and Portugal lean ever closer together.\n\nSalazar has demanded that Franco change the official languages in each region in order to accommodate the new status of Portugal, with Portuguese language being enforced in regions such as Catalonia and Euskadi just like Castilian Spanish. Franco has disagreed, arguing that such a move would only cause the regionalist movements to spark back to life, each of them trying to claim the same linguistic rights as Portugal.\n\nThe Debate has ultimately ended with a tie. With the mainland's linguistic status quo being preserved."
 IBR.41.a:0 "More gridlock from the Caudillos."

 IBR.42.d:0 "Rio de Oro has been a colony of Spain for quite some time now, and is currently the oldest owned foreign territory of our country. While the creation of the Union has set back the integration of the Rio de Oro into Spain proper, the lack of native opposition and the swift progress of infrastructure works in the region has made Franco confident that it can be easily incorporated into the Union as a proper state.\n\nThis however, did not sit well with Salazar. The area is mostly Spanish speaking, with the introduction of Portuguese being very recent and very limited. Salazar fears that Franco's plans to incorporate the colony directly to Spain proper and force once again Spanish hegemony over the rest of the region. Having all of his integration proposals blocked off by a relentless Salazar, Franco has decided to refrained from integrating Rio de Oro until the province is able to be integrated under joint administration between Portugal and Spain."

 IBR.43.t:0 "Gibraltar Debate - Funding Amount"
 IBR.43.d:0 "Spain has been left in charge of the Atlantropa project for some time now, and maintaing the dam itself as a whole has been severely damaging for our country. This has led to the final decision years ago that the Union would cover for the expenses of vital repairs, but would refuse to pay for normal maintenance, which would run at the hands of the Triumvirate.\n\nAs our policy remains the same, both Franco and Salazar have their concerns with different regions of the dam. The internal workings of its system are starting to rot, and the risk of them collapsing sooner or later seems to be ever growing if our government doesn't pay for its replacement. On the other hand, the conditions of the technicians that work on the dam to keep it working are also severely threatened. While our manpower is plentiful for the dam, our technical experts are hard to come by, and even more those brave enough that wish to work on Atlantropa. After some short discussions and some interjections with some high ranking members of the maintenance crew of the dams, both Caudillos have decided they will increase the spending in the working conditions for the Technical experts in order to provide them with a safer work enviroment, as to not risk running out of manpower in a moment of need."

 IBR.44.d:0 "A huge issue Atlantropa has brought up is the sheer demand of manpower required to keep it from falling apart. While the Union has kept the demand covered until now by hiring a lot of state workers, the dangerous working conditions, relatively low pay and even lower prospects of professional growth has forced us to severely rethink the way we handle our workforce on the dam.\n\nWhile Salazar has proposed to continue using cheap workforce, Franco has come up with a better solution: conscripting criminals for them to work on the dam in exchange for their liberation in ten years time. According to Franco, they'd be able to import prisoners other countries want to 'dispose of', and would be able to tackle the expenses of this new penitentiary system by providing for the basic livelihood of said criminals. While Salazar believes this will be detrimental in the long run as it allows dangerous criminals to be absolved from guilt, Franco has reassured him that hardly anyone will be able to survive those ten years of work, and that the expenses of maintance would be cut by 30% in doing so. With both Caudillos agreeing in the end, Franco's proposal will come into effect and the workforce in the dam shall be progressively replaced by criminal conscripts."

 IBR.45.d:0 "One of the major flaws of Atlantropa is the massive expense it places on the state, with little to show for it in return. With the ever increasing expenditure in its maintenance, the Caudillos have been looking for a way to make the dam profitable for years.\n\nA new proposal has managed to reach the Caudillos recently, consisting of a scheme devised by architect and engineer Pedro Martínez Ayola to reform a series of sectors in the dam to produce hydroelectric power. However, the cost of his project is huge, and just the maintenance of the dam is a risky and slow endeavor. However, both Caudillos have agreed that the expansion will be necessary in the long run, so both are willing to start preparations for those modifications to begin. However, it should be noted that said modifications affect core sections of the dam, and the high risk of reforming these areas may lead to a higher casualty rate than usual in the maintenance crew."

Salazar argues the Iberian Flag should take precedence over the banner of the Reich, and that the bottom of the Iberian flag should begin at the top of the Reich's flag. Franco urges that the Iberian flag should be much higher and at least two or three meters above.\n\nThe pair ended up arguing for several minutes over the issue, and it ended in an archetypal lack of consensus."

Salazar insisted that the siestas, primarily in Spain, needed a maximum cap to try and limit the economic effects of siestas. Franco countered this by retorting that economic growth could also be streamlined if Iberia were to adopt a uniform time zone, rather than keeping the current two. The argument went nowhere, as the two men simply continuously repeated their arguments and were unable to come to any kind of settlement."

 IBR.51.d:0 "Today a series of meetings have begun between the Caudillos Franco and Salazar to debate the establishment of an Iberian Council. The first meeting consisted of determining how and why the Iberian Council will be created and the Caudillos have already disagreed on some things.\n\nEven though both Caudillos agree that the Council should be small at first and grow with time, the growing speed of the Council is one of the things they disagree with; while Franco thinks the growth should be slow so that the power balance remains steady and doesn't unexpectedly shift hands, Salazar wants the growth to be as quick as possible to try avoiding the bureaucratic pain the slow growth rate would cause. This matter was debated for far longer than expected but the meeting finally ended.\n\nBoth Caudillos left the meeting happy because they agreed on the fact that the Iberian Council was going to be created 'for the benefit of the Iberian people' even though that was not what they called the meeting for and no news of the establishment debate have been revealed."

 IBR.52.d:0 "One of the hottest issues when it comes to the formation of the Iberian Council is who is represented there and how they should be represented and as with most things, Franco and Salazar have different opinions on the matter.\n\nFranco stated that the Council should be based on what he considers are the three natural parts of society: the family, where one is born; the town, where one lives and the syndicate, where one works. Salazar opposed this and instead proposed that the Council should be filled with members chosen with an odd pyramidal system. Franco's difficulty to understand Salazar's unique choosing method together with Salazar's frontal denial of Franco's proposal made sure that the meeting lasted much longer than it was intended to.\n\nAfter much explaining Franco finally understood Salazar's sytem, which he then vetoed before calling of the meeting. Both Caudillos say they are very close to choosing a system but not a word was said regarding representation for regions like Catalonia, Galicia or the Basque Country."

Of course, as with most things, the Caudillos are deeply divided in this matter.\n\nFranco proposed that his own residence, the Royal Palace of El Pardo should be the meeting place but Salazar then proposed his own estate to host the Council. This conversation then transformed into an argument to see whose residence was better before turning into a string of insults to the other's. The matter was finally dropped and the debate moved to the proposals of hosting the Council in either the Palacio de las Cortes or the São Bento Palace with each proposal being defended by Franco and Salazar respectively and followed a pattern similar to the private residence proposal, arguing which one is better before deciding to insult the other building.\n\nThe meeting was called off but both Caudillos say they are still analyzing options. The only thing this meeting left clear was that El Pardo has better plumbing while São Bento has less leaks."

This veto situation was the matter debated today for the formation of the Iberian Council.\n\nFranco proposed that veto powers should be reserved for himself and Salazar, but Salazar unsurprisingly said no to this and proposed that a proposal could only be vetoed if the number of members of the council who decided to veto it was higher than the number of those that didn't want to veto it. Franco then refuted Salazar's argument asking if those members who voted blank would simply be ignored. This spiralled out of control and ended up being a heated philosophical debate of what is a veto and whether a veto could be nullified if it was discovered it was motivated to harm the Iberian people rather than help them.\n\nAt the end nothing was agreed on, so we must expect the veto powers will remain in the hands of the Caudillos, at least for now."

Council members are deeply divided in this issue and they aren't willing to listen to other proposals that aren't their own, so the debate transformed into a full fight between some of the members and the Caudillos had to be escorted out of the room.\n\nEven though this fight wasn't known outside the room, the press has already started writing stories about what could have happened in there and this has both Franco and Salazar enraged, who have decided that there will always be a couple of Guardia Civiles in the room to watch over the members and to avoid future fights, members aren't allowed to go in groups larger than three in the halls of the Palace of Congress."

Everyone knows that the Iberian government is divided into several factions, all bickering for more control and influence, and some of them even willing to go so far as to openly disagree with the Caudillos. To prevent the Council from being drowned by this poisonous factionalism, Salazar had the idea of stuffing the Council with members that blindly supported him and Franco. Surprisingly, Franco agreed to this.\n\nHowever, this plan for disproportionate representation has come at a cost. Many members of government have protested that the Iberian Council isn't fully proportional and that some "sectors'' have more representation than others. Of course, when asked about these "sectors" most of the complainers fall silent, since the factionalism that grips the government is a deeply taboo subject which the Caudillos have tried to keep behind closed doors.\n\nUntil someone is brave enough to speak up, the Caudillos can seat back and relax knowing that the members of the Council support them and their decisions."

Yet a recent article in the press has shed light on this issue, arguing that the establishment of the Iberian Council constitutes a breach of the Iberian constitution, and suggests that the Caudillos intentionally avoided bringing up a constitutional alteration as it could decrease their own powers.\n\nThe Caudillos have responded by announcing that they would rectify the discrepancy and alter the constitution. A very extravagant public ceremony was organized in Madrid in which Franco and Salazar, both in their best suits, officially changed the constitution and added the Iberian Council to it. This ceremony is already being satirized in the press with Franco and Salazar depicted pouring correction fluid over the article and rewriting it with a ball-point pen.

To that end, we must ensure that the councillors do not operate with too much independence. Beginning today, at all further meetings of the council, councillors will be provided with a document stating the goals which the meeting is intended to accomplish. No longer will councillors debate what goals to pursue.

One such incident involved a physical confrontation between two Council members after one insulted the mother of the other Councilor.\n\nTo remedy this issue, the Caudillos have decided to allow "elections" for Council members.

He has been heard bragging that all representatives from Portugal are loyal, saying that a good leader would have no trouble with some pesky politicians.\n\nTo this end, Franco has come up with several options. Those representatives found to be especially rebellious would be removed and jailed for treason. This move might cause more problems that it would fix, but Franco will be in absolute control.

 IBR.405.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 IBR.405.d:0 "The German Reich, once thought to last a thousand years, is in peril. Adolf Hitler's death has lead to various pretenders to the throne, quickly turning Germany into a battleground. Many of our citizens, and indeed most of our government, believes that the best course of action would be not to get involved. After all, Germany eating itself alive gives us the valuable opportunity to focus on our own affairs without worrying about imminent invasion.\n\nThe esteemed Caudillo, however, has other plans.\n\nFrancisco Franco believes we could potentially come out much stronger by involving ourselves in the affairs of the civil war, at least to a certain extent. He has proposed two ways we can do this, the first being sending some aid to Albert Speer's faction, in hopes that we may gain a powerful ally when this is all over. The second option, which Franco seems to personally prefer, is simply to sell guns and supplies to each side, making enough of a profit to fix our economic woes.\n\nIt seems that to maximize efficiency, it would be in our best interests to put our effort into only one option, as we dont have the resources to stretch ourselves between the two. But surely, with the guidance of the Caudillos, our intervention in the German Civil War can only turn out well."
 IBR.405.a:0 "What could possibly go wrong?"
 
 IBR.406.t:0 "Money Talks!"
 IBR.406.d:0 "For once, the Caudillos have come to an agreement. Speer has a very slim chance of winning, and even if he does through our aid, it's not exactly good praxis to help out the nation responsible for ruining up our economy in the first place. If we're going to get involved, we should at least get something out of it.\n\nWhile they debated who to sell equipment to, Salazar came up with a brilliant idea: just sell as much as we can to as many sides are as willing to buy. By simple math, this would quadruple our potential profits and provide us with enough currency to get our economy back into shape, which will hopefully solve other issues down the line.\n\nSome in the government, as per usual, worry that this whole act of "playing all sides against" each other is morally dubious. Moreover, they worry that if one faction finds out, it is quite possible we will face not only diplomatic condemnation but also sanctions, something Iberia can ill afford. Fortunately, our Caudillos are brilliant leaders, and surely they have an excellent plan in mind."

 IBR.408.t:0 "Our Path To Profit"
 IBR.408.d:0 "The idea of playing all sides while staying hidden has ultimately proven appealing to most within our government. In part due to anti-German sentiment, and definitely not because they were pressured into agreeing with the Caudillos out of fear of their own safety. A plan of attack has been drawn up, strategizing what items to sell, and where to sell them.\n\nObviously, Goering is going to be our biggest buyer, so he will be prioritized, and likely the source of the plurality of our profits. Not only does he control a lot of territory, which comes with a lot of troops, but as a diehard militarist he's bound to be grabbing guns even when he doesn't need them. Bormann is second priority, as he controls a lot of territory himself but is a little more reserved. Many feel safe in discounting Speer, but his army is rather sparse, so profit could be made there too. Hell, even Heydrich might be willing to buy some of our stuff, though admittedly he's lowest on the priority list.\n\nNow, with the plans set out, only one issue remains. The fact of the matter is that we cant sell our weapons to all sides, at least not directly. We're going to need to find a middleman. But who among the nations of the world is willing to dive this deep into the black market?"
 IBR.408.a:0 "We'll make them an offer they can't refuse."
 
 IBR.409.t:0 "Sending The Goods To Brittany"
 IBR.409.d:0 "As it turns out, we only really have one option when it comes to black market deals of this magnitude: Brittany. Sticking out of both France and the Greater German Reich like a sore thumb in more ways than one, this little nation has gathered quite a reputation in its ability to smuggle all sorts of forbidden things into Germany and its territories. And as luck would have it, Breton agents within our country have heard of our predicament, and are willing to help us out.\n\nNow, granted, this comes with its share of risks. In addition to Brittany being home to some very unsavory figures, pirates, rogues, and the like, using them as a middleman means we need to add another layer of secrecy. Surely, if other countries, or even if our own citizens, get wind of us consorting with black market dealers, they would think less of us. But as long as everybody stays quiet, we should have no problems making a profit."
 IBR.409.a:0 "Dangerous games..."
 
 IBR.410.t:0 "A Leak?"
 IBR.410.d:0 "Ever vigilant, it is the accountant who first catches an air of trouble. Looking through the various papers where transactions are recorded, he realizes something is quite wrong, the numbers don't make sense. Not what's going out, mind you, but what's coming in, there's far far too little considering what we've been sending out.\n\nAn investigation by other accountants confirms this, and the matter is brought up to the Caudillos themselves. Franco and Salazar comb through the findings themselves, and are absolutely aghast to discover that so little money has come back to us. They soon realize that there's only one explanation: our middleman dealers in Brittany are smuggling off both goods and profits, leaving only a trickle to come back to us.\n\n"You utter baffoon!" cries Salazar, "When you told me we were going to sell to all sides, you assured me you had found reputable markets to push our goods through!"\n\nThe Castillien dictator stammers, a mix of anger and confusion in his voice. "I can assure you, I...WE thought we ha-"\n\n"Brittany is literally the OPPOSITE of reputable!" his counterpart interrupts. "This level of blithering idiocy from your administration is exa-"\n\n"Now wait just a minute! Who are you calling-"\n\nThus, as per usual, the joint dictators began yet another argument, spewing insults and threats at each other late into the night for all to hear. And though they eventually gave up yelling at each other in order to sleep, the problems still remain. Our black market dealers have double crossed us, and we have wasted valuable time and assets attempting to reach Germany through them."
 IBR.410.a:0 "Damned Pirates!"
 
 IBR.411.t:0 "Marking Up Prices"
 IBR.411.d:0 "Obviously, we only have a limited number of goods to sell around, and thus simple math tells us that there's a limited profit to be gained at the moment. We COULD actually put in some effort for once, and ramp up our equipment production so that we can turn in a profit, but Francisco Franco has a far better idea.\n\nRather than producing four times the goods, we'll get the same amount of money with a quarter of the effort if we just quadruple the prices. They get their guns, Iberia gets a profit, everybody wins. Mostly us, anyways. Of course, some in the government, Salazar included, believe that if we jack up the prices too much nobody will buy from us, but they have forgotten to factor in how desperate each of the German factions are for more equipment. Surley, they will be willing to shill out some extra cash in this hour of need."
 IBR.411.a:0 "How could we fail?"
 
 IBR.412.t:0 "Offering Military Grade Weapons"
 IBR.412.d:0 "Even by raising the prices to ridiculous amounts, we still don't have enough equipment to turn a meaningful profit. Sure, we could actually make enough arms and supplies to earn a meaningful amount of money in the process, but that would take actual hard work. However, once again there seems to be an easier way around this.\n\nAs it turns out, we still have plenty of Triumvirate equipment that we... borrowed from Italy. Since it's very doubtful that they're going to try and take it back, why not make some use of it by selling it to the Germans? With all this stuff sitting in reserve, we're likely to make nearly double what was projected.\n\nOf course, once again the worrywarts in government are raising concerns. Salazar in particular thinks that this is a bad idea as "we don't actually have that much Triumvirate reserves" and "we have no idea if it even works properly or not". Even if it's not in the best condition, it's not like the buyers are going to know about it until they've already paid for it."
 IBR.412.a:0 "The Italians won't miss them."
 
 IBR.413.t:0 "Fading Profits?"
 IBR.413.d:0 "In theory, our two-pronged approach of raising prices while digging for extra guns would have increased profits immensely. It was clever, ingenious even. But unfortunately, this being Iberia, nothing ever goes according to plan.\n\nThe Caudillos got a rather rude awakening around noon today when the most recent profit reports came back...and were almost entirely unchanged from the last one. In fact, a quick look back at previous reports shows that our antics haven't made a lick of difference. These results, to say the least, have baffled both our ministers and Franco, who were positive that quadrupling prices would mean quadruple profit, and not result in crashing demand.\n\nFurious by the incompetence from his Spanish counterpart, a meeting between the Caudillos today resulted in Salazar quickly losing all patience. "You simple-minded idiot!" he screams, ripping up some important documents out of sheer anger, "What foul witchery drove you to such ludicrously poor judgement?"\n\n"In my defense," stammers Franco, "it seemed like a good idea at the ti-"\n\n"Oh, so it SEEMED like a good idea, very nice! Sure, you acted without any oversight from the Portuguese government and made errors that are leaving our economists alternating between shaking their heads and laughing uncontrollably, but I guess since it SEEMED good everything's peachy, huh!?"\n\n"That's entirely unfair! At least I'm actually coming up with ideas! I didn't see you brainstorming any way to profit off the civil war! Sure, some poor decisions were made, but at least I acted!"\n\n"If the choice is between inaction and acting like an imbecile, I choose the former!"\n\nAs with many others, this argument between the Caudillos carried on for several hours, ending with nothing accomplished but a lot of hot air being blown around. Regardless, it seems that Iberia's schemes have failed to pay off, in both senses of the word, and may have made our economy even worse for wear."

 #Heydrich's Tree
 IBR.76.t:0 "Heydrich Wins The German Civil War!"
 IBR.76.d:0 "Terrible news has reached the Iberian peninsula, the German Civil War was finally over, its last contender standing was Reinhard Heydrich, a secretive, ideologically driven monster of a man. The initial jubilant reaction to the more immediate threat of a rampaging Goering having been defeated has been replaced by a thoughtful, uneasy silence in our nation. Now there was only a dark stain in the center of Europe, ready to swallow its poor, weary citizens and drag them into the abyss just like it did with the other, at least human, Führer contenders. Heydrich, the blonde beast, the hangman, now sat in a ruined Germania, his plans unknown, just like his equally elusive counterpart in Burgundy. Panic has stricken certain parts of our nation, the German refugees who had escaped the horrors of the Civil War and the SS being especially distraught by the news. The church also seemingly was recoiling in horror at the news. Attendance for mass in the immediate days after Heydrich's victory proclamation rose dramatically, yet no real answers could be given to the terror stricken people. Frantic public officials and other authority figures tried to give calming reassurances to the population stratas that were terrified at the development in Germany using propaganda and speeches, yet their own unease and lack of knowledge on the handling of this crisis hindered their use ultimately. A few dissenting clergymen advocated that these were the end days, God's last test for humanity before he would come to lead us into salvation, but these doomsayers were quickly taken away from any official positions when the reports of their wrongdoings reached the police, most not to be heard of again and certainly not the last of the desperate who would befall to this fate. In these dark times, the only certainty, in relation to the future of Europe and therefore Iberia, was uncertainty. "
 IBR.76.a:0 "Merciful God, forgive us for our sins..."

 IBR.77.t:0 "The Panicked Commanders"
 IBR.77.d:0 "The news of Heydrich's victory evidently did not just worry those who understood the darkness of the beasts ideology; military commanders and officers in all of the Iberian armed forces were exceedingly panicking about the battle hardened and extremely disciplined SS becoming Germany's primary armed forces, no longer restricted by the Wehrmacht and the NSDAP leadership. Our enlightened, civilian leadership however seems far less on edge, their expert political analysts having predicted that Germany would spend a vast amount of time, impossible to judge at this moment, recovering from the Civil War, and be far less powerful due to the collapse of their sphere at the end of it. Any plans the reticent hangman of Prague might have would be limited to the admittedly poor German populace that had to suffer his rule. However not all in government seemed to share this view, some took the worries of the military quite seriously indeed, even when they recognized the factual evidence of the political situation in the center of Europe. Chief amongst these was Caudillo Salazar, who had always despised the Nazis as being paganistic barbarians. For him, Heydrich and his twisted ideology represented a darker if not as obvious threat as Goering did. Which faction was to be proven correct in their estimation of Germany's threat to Iberia would only be determined by time, yet it did not harm for the military to be prepared for any unexpected circumstances. "
 IBR.77.a:0 "Calm down and make a plan!"

 IBR.80.t:0 "Guarding The Dam"
 IBR.80.d:0 "Yesterday, during one of the short, regular meetings with senior military and naval personnel that Caudillo Salazar had requested since Heydrich's seizure of ultimate power in Germany, following his victory over the other Führer candidates in a civil war that had drained the once proud German nation, both of the Caudillos were informed of the necessity to reinforce military presence at the Gibraltar dam. One of the navy commanders spoke gravely about the woeful shortcomings of the defence around the dam, how simple it would be scuttle the current naval installations and ships stationed near Gibraltar for a military power such as Germany. A military commander interjected with corroborating evidence that it was unlikely that if the Germans were to assault Iberia that they would cross the mountainous Pyrenees, and would more likely commence a major naval invasion of one of the weaker port regions of the peninsula or strike right at the dam, which for then was a symbol of lost prestige. Caudillo Salazar was listening intently, noting down all the information that the advisors were giving him while Franco sat back looking dazed and bored. For him there was no chance the weakened Germans would ever be capable again to pose a serious threat to the empire he and Salazar had built, yet as a military man himself he could hardly argue against the necessity of careful advanced planning, so for once when Salazar proposed to deepen defence around the dam he did not oppose his Portuguese counterpart." 
 IBR.80.a:0 "Let's hope it's enough."

 IBR.81.t:0 "Pumping Up The Military"
 IBR.81.d:0 "Caudillo Salazar's deepening paranoia since Heydrich's victory was not going unnoticed to Franco. The Portuguese statesman was beginning to speak the language of the dictator of Spain, who in a not so distant life had been a brilliant general. Salazar was proposing spending more of the yearly budget on defence, building up the Iberian forces to a standard that they could be considered a deadly force to be reckoned with, not just target practice for the disciplined, dangerous SS. Franco allowed a brief smile during their meeting, something he could rarely afford with his constant squabbling with his fellow Caudillo, as he lightly slapped Salazar's back in a friendly fashion. He assured the Portuguese that if he desired to expand the land and naval forces of the union he would not oppose him during the council, rather he would enthusiastically encourage the idea, giving a speech to accompany the proposal. The relief that began to spread across Salazar's face disconcerted Franco slightly, he did not understand why the fiercely intelligent Caudillo would be so worried about a destroyed nation, however he did not question it as they then returned to normal disagreement on the next matter of state."
 IBR.81.a:0 "Who cares if it's sustainable?"

 IBR.82.t:0 "Unity Against The External Threat"
 IBR.82.d:0 "In an unprecedented move of unity both Caudillos announced during a recent council meeting that in the face of the immense external danger an SS run Germany could pose to Iberias unity and quite frankly survival, that both wanted to depend the solidarity that the Iberian peoples felt towards one another. Therefore propaganda tools during the upcoming weeks should be focusing on painting a beautiful picture of a splendid union of equals, united in diversity against the uniform collectivism the Nazis would impose on a conquered Iberia. The surprised council members left the conference room in a dreamlike state, both terrified of the nature of the message that been imparted on them but also the unprecedented cooperation between both Caudillos. Little did they know that Salazar had to compromise with his Spanish counterpart in a fashion that rather went against his personal principles but had to be done to deal with the threat he knew would come in time, if not in his lifetime then in the next. He agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Francos suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity. Anything was better than falling to the darkness bumbling and fermenting in Europe's dark heart, anything, even if it meant agreeing with his gruff fellow Caudillo."

As Bormann has shown no desire to change German foreign policy, the Caudillos and Iberian Council are convinced that the previous plans are still effective, and that there is ample time to implement them."

However, with the clear violation of Vichy France by Brittany and Burgundy, we can no longer trust the Germans to take a sane route in dealing with the French. We must renew the old Pyrenees Line immediately. In order to do so, we will initiate several inspections along the line, replace built-in artillery, and ensure that the logistical problems involved with running heavy artillery and armor in the mountains are maximized for a potential threat, yet minimized for our purposes.\n\nIf the Germans come, we will be ready for them."

 IBR.87.t:0 "Distributing Air Raid Sirens"
 IBR.87.d:0 "Bormann is a staunch conservative, and this means that his methods shall be predictable and based on Germany's previous exploits. One of the most notable of these was their aerial bombing operations, which legendarily crippled the industrial capacity of any nation that drew their ire. The fearful capabilities of the Luftwaffe can be seen in the desolation of western Africa following the Second World War, and the bombing operations that turned Russia from a respectable power into an anarchic wasteland. Thus, in order to avoid meeting this fate ourselves, a means of protecting our civilians is necessary.\n\nThis means shall come in the form of the humble air raid siren. While not capable of directly protecting our industry, they would give ample time to our citizens to get to shelters, and for various cities' garrisons to get anti-aircraft systems online. Until we can revolutionize our air force and meet the modern standards demanded by our potential opponents, this stopgap measure will have to do."

 IBR.88.t:0 "Securing Equatorial Africa"
 IBR.88.d:0 "Our small Equatorial African colony has been in jeopardy for some time now, due to the heavy German presence in its area. While Müller is slightly more reasonable than the Reichskommissars that seized the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa, he still presents the same mortal threat that any agent of the Reich does, simply by existing on our borders.\n\nAdditionally, with the formation of the Afrika-Schild and the South African War, it is extremely evident that the Reichskommissars will not hestitate to expand wantonly into any territory that takes their fancy. Therefore, our at-risk colony must be fortified as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. While its risky position and the appalling state of our economy will present challenges in this sector, there's nothing that a few honeyed words, promises of freedom, and 'volunteer' labor cannot solve, when it comes to the field of construction. Hopefully, when the endeavor is over, the Reichskommissars will choose a different target, and kindly leave us alone."
 IBR.88.a:0 "Our time has come."
 
 IBR.89.t:0 "Silence the Saber"
 IBR.89.d:0 "Now that our more urgent preparations are complete, it is time to finally put an end to Bormann's sabre-rattling... by rattling our own sabre back! We shall hold an enormous military exercise in the far western Pyrenees, simulating a potential German invason from the French border. While the plans for this exercise existed before, it has been heavily altered to reflect the loss of the Triumvirate as dependable allies in wartime. Still, even without Italian naval support, armored divisions, and supplemental airpower, the display is sure to be enough to make Bormann turn his head towards a weaker neighbor.\n\nThe festivities shall occur over a week-long period, and be attended personally by both Caudillos. Elements from every wing of the Iberian armed forces shall be present, from the federal army, to the Portuguese Army, to the Spanish Army, to Guardia Civil units being used as reserves. Two full tank divisions, the majority of Iberia's armor corps, shall be deployed in advanced maneuvers in the foothills of the Pyrenees, while split elements of the Spanish and Portuguese armies shall serve as the federal army's opposing force in the mountains themselves. To prevent foreign interference, a massive deployment of military policemen and elements of the AAS shall stand in support.\n\nAs a bonus, since the exercise is occuring within the Basque-populated region of Iberia, it could serve to shock the problematic ETA into lying low for a while..."
 IBR.89.a:0 "Hush now, everything is alright."

 #Goering's Tree
 IBR.90.t:0 "Goering Wins The German Civil War!"
 IBR.90.d:0 "The whole political world of Iberia was in chaotic uproar, entire ministries in utter pandemonium, with civil servants rushing from meeting to meeting, each more depressing than the last in its tone and content.\n\nThe disastrous news that had reached them this morning from Germany had awakened an ice cold terror in many a strong man. Göring, the proud, fat oaf, who had had the immense backing of most Wehrmacht personnel, was now the new Führer of the destroyed Reich, now but an army with a half functioning state. He had vanquished his opponents in hellfire, carving a deep scar into Germany, one that was unlikely to heal soon if ever. The unwavering militarist was likely already crafting extensive plans for foreign policy escapades with his hawkish advisors, while all around him ordinary people were suffering abject poverty and devastation.\n\nAn emergency council meeting had been called when the official declaration of victory had come from Germania, both Caudillos fearful of the danger that may soon face Europe and Iberia. Salazar seemingly had first been surprisingly joyous that it was not Heydrich who had climbed the iron throne of the Reich, but he also shared his Spanish counterparts apprehension of what an openly militaristic Germany could symbolise for their future. Their only hope was that the Reich still needed time to repair and prepare its offensive forces. If we act quickly we might be able to hold off the Germanic horde when it comes."
 IBR.90.a:0 "We must prepare, fast!"
 
 IBR.91.t:0 "The Pyrenees Line"
 IBR.91.d:0 "The emergency council meeting concluded with a series of intense measures that were to be undertaken with immediate effect, one of these was the reactivation and expansion of the Pyrenees defensive line. The mobile Germans had proven themselves expert in defeating, or rather avoiding, strong defensive positions in their last European conquest to encircle troop contingents and rush strategic targets.\n\nHowever, times have radically changed. More effective and efficient defensive installations have been invented to compliment that are able to compliment the natural fortification that the Pyrenees Mountains gives our great Peninsula. Even more importantly military analysts have also concluded that the German hordes had enjoyed a great deal of luck in the conquests of France and the lowlands, something we will not allow them to have if they dare knock on our doors. However, some of our high command, especially those who advocate for increased special force use, have warned of naval invasions to try to take key strategic ports or possibly even the vulnerable Gibraltar dam itself. Although not an impossibility we still have deemed the Germans under Göring will prioritize a direct approach."
 IBR.91.a:0 "Hopefully it can hold them."
 
 
 IBR.93.t:0 "Fortify Equatorial Africa"
 IBR.93.d:0 "Just a decade ago, the fat Reichsmarschall had had the brilliant idea of seizing the Portuguese colonies in southern Africa, a bold move to consolidate German control in the region during the formation of the vast African Reichskommissariats. One that fit in well with Hitler's intense megalomania. It was what had driven the pragmatically opposed Caudillos in each other's arms in the first place, the starting shot of Iberian unification which Salazar had initially opposed based on sovereignty issues. With the loss of his treasured African colonies however, he had no other choice but to accept Franco's proposals for a united front against the reviled Germans.\n\nNow, the German Civil War was over, and the hated Göring stood victorious over his defeated foes. The expansionist, the military man. In time he would certainly bring the African Reichskommissars back under his jackboot and look to Equatorial Africa as another target. It was a simple assumption to make; therefore one Göring was likely to take into consideration.\n\nDespite the region originally having been a Spanish colony, Salazar was ecstatically pursuing plans to fortify the last Iberian stronghold below the Sahara. For once, for the usually collected Caudillo, this had become a matter of pride and prestige; Franco also not eager to lose what formally was just his colony, did not sit idly by either. Extensive plans for strong fortification lines and subsequent guerilla warfare, once the lines would be breached, were drafted, military high command eager to follow the lead of their Caudillos as they saw the strong strategic use of drawing away more German forces from the European theater. The Nazis would have to fight hard and suffer bitterly for our land in the sun."

Therefore propaganda tools during the upcoming weeks should be focusing on painting a beautiful picture of a splendid union of equals, united in diversity against the painful conflict and conquest that Göring would bring upon Iberia, reminiscent of the horror of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe terrified council members left the conference room in a dreamlike state, both eager to impart the Caudillos message into public policy but also happily shocked by the unprecedented cooperation between both Caudillos. On this matter the two old men had finally come to full agreement, both were too fearful of the danger that was strengthening just beyond the horizon, a bond reforged that first had been set in place by the same man they now again may have to confront. Salazar even agreed with Franco to push total Iberian unity for the sake of a better prepared union. He also eventually caved to Franco's s suggestion to deal harshly but quietly with any resisting elements to the state, again a move towards better stability and unity.

 #Speer's Tree
 IBR.97.t:0 "Speer Wins The German Civil War!"
 IBR.97.d:0 "An official news broadcast from a ruined but now hopeful Germania was picked up on waiting Iberian airwaves today, both Caudillo Salazar and Franco waiting together for the past few hours for the statement from the Reichstag to finally be pronounced. Speer, the liberal and idol of Germany's youth, has won the German Civil War, a huge sigh of relief could almost be heard coming from all freedom loving peoples of this wretched earth. The Nazi reformer now becoming Führer was seen as a much appreciated shift away from the current dark paradigm that Europe has had to suffer for the last 20 years, conquest and economic ruin being its defining hallmarks. In Iberia this view was shared by the vast majority of the populace, even both Caudillos could for once agree that this was the best possible outcome of that terrible conflict, an outcome with a future that may not have to involve further war and death. The possibility of regained prosperity from trade, bettering of diplomatic relations, finally the chance for Europe to come closer together. After brief celebrations and a short meeting with other senior government officials, the two Caudillos parted ways for now, Salazar leaving with a secretive, yet buoyant grin. If everything went accordingly now and Speer kept to his reformist promises, the Iberian Union may become defunct as a necessary measure of unity against an external threat.

The new Führer was still a national socialist, formerly a devoted, close acolyte of Hitler, one that may talk sense but still a by blood a barbaric German. The idea that Iberia could now relax, possibly even devolve as Salazar hoped for an idealistic future, was not one rooted in the still grotesque reality they had to endure. After initial jubilance even the Portuguese Caudillo became rooted again, adopting his usual composure in the next council meeting. Invited military and economic analysts began to give estimates, derived from close analysis of Germany's material reality and Speers proposed policies, of how long it would take Germany to rebuild and what sort of military capabilities the Iberians would need to prepare for in a worst case scenario. Caudillo Franco, unusually for the aging fighter, was very invested in this meeting, interrupting regularly to ask specific questions on military matters. Salazar, spotting Franco taking charge of the situation in a way he did not appreciate in the slightest began to make equally valid statements on the political and diplomatic motivations Speer may follow, trying to reduce the push for further Iberian military expansion as he viewed this as being an unjustified, aggressive move, one that may produce negative reaction. Underneath his open reasoning, he also was motivated to try to reduce the further integration of the two nations this would create. Surprisingly, the council took Franco's side in this matter, the final decision of the council being to prepare for a worst case possibility, to better be safe than sorry. Salazar retched internally once he left the meeting."

Instead it was greeted with the unusual sight of a rather large contingent of the Iberian navy, both Portuguese and Spanish ships conducting a large scale exercise, a show of strength personally overseen by Caudillo Franco from the shore. The brutish Spaniard had secured this personal vanity project out of his Portuguese counterpart in the recent debate over the Iberian response towards the victory of the liberal reformer Speer in the German Civil War. Salazar, quite fond of the his navy himself, had quickly recognized that the Germans would take little notice of this waste of precious fuel, their attention mainly focused inwards at this moment, any of their little foreign policy decision being in regards to their subjects around the world, and therefore granted his fellow Caudillo's request without much opposition. He needed Franco grateful and ready to compromise with him on more important issues regarding the new diplomatic scene of Europe, but the training also showed him the Portuguese naval capacity, which he also inspected closely from his comfortable viewing platform standing next to Franco. It after all was vital to rebuild the empire he had lost to the marauding Teutons, who it seems now might be finally tamed from their destructive nature."

Or so it would seem for anyone watching the sunburnt manual labourers and military men toiling away endlessly, using man's great ingenuity to further expand the large fortifications that lined the beautiful mountain range on the Southern French border. Again the Iberian council had voted for Franco's gruffly made proposal that had led to the constructions, to the deep and bitter chagrin of Salazar who was getting more impatient with Franco's defensive demands each new meeting. The Spaniard did not seem to run out of ideas. So far the intelligence services had reported nothing that could suggest Speer had untoward desires when it came to Iberia and its peoples. Whether that would change with each new military venture that Franco departed on was yet to be seen. In all honesty, Salazar was not entirely against the fortress installations being built, yet for different reasons to the Spanish Caudillo. He saw a great threat emitting from the former German puppet of Burgundy, the secretive SS state. Any kind of defense against this ominous threat was a welcome one indeed. He therefore has not vetoed this idea either."

 IBR.108.d:0 "In the ever worsening personal conflict between the two contrasting Caudillos over the official Iberian government policy towards the new Reich, the traditional statesman and politician Salazar had finally been able to wrangle a significant concession out of the aging former general. Drawing upon all the previous plans and projects from the Spanish Caudillo that he had not vetoed for the sake of an opportunity like this, the old Portuguese convinced the Spaniard that even if the government's policy will follow one of caution toward the wobbling European hegemon, we should not allow the Germans to see any aggression in our handling of state affairs. Following another debate, this time more of a monologue as Franco had lost interest, it was decided that diplomacy would be initiated with the new regime in Germania, diplomacy on mutual necessity. In other words trade and commerce. It would allow a channel of communication in the possibility of crisis. Through this change in policy it might also be possible to expand the intelligence network we are still building in the ruined country, to ascertain the direction and working of the German government, but for Salazar more importantly it could allow a thawing of previously frozen relations between the two European nations. Like usual, Franco had not been able to object to the ascetic statesman when he had begun his rant. He saw no real danger in pursuing what Salazar proposed but deemed it not useful enough for Iberia, the nation needed a threatening external force to unite against. Looks like he might have to create a new enemy."

Fundamental changes that are likely to cause a maelstrom of death, sucking in unfortunate and guilty souls alike. With the unexpected student coup against Speer, the great reformer figurehead having lost his place in the hearts and minds of the intensely radical members in his faction after allowing his territory to fall into a state of anarchy, the Iberian government prepared for a worse civil war outcome than hoped at the initial outbreak. These almost fantastical turn of events however are far worse than expected. We have no idea what is going to happen now, no idea who the merciless, revenge seeking killers are going to target next once they have finished in Germany, after all they thrive on terror and hatred enacted on anything that represents the current establishment. Europe, in its current state a visual representation of the dark fantasies the Nazis had imagined, was therefore not safe. For the lack of knowledge about the DSR motives, we do know is that the storm clouds on the horizon have now become considerably darker and more destructive. It's likely only a matter of time before they expand outwards of the ruins of the Reich. "

It therefore came as no surprise that both the Caudillos were not this morning reading both the official newspapers and government briefings before their planned meeting, but rather focusing their attention on the hastily drafted notes that the security branch had supplied their aides with the night before. Salazar was the first to look up, with his wisened, squinting eyes, from the typed out pages, as his previous knowledge already covered most of the information provided here again, Franco needed a while longer, his brow furrowed in a crease of utter concentration. After a gruff cough the Spaniard began to make his observations on what he had read. It seems the previously installed moles in both the German state apparatus and societal institutions had mostly survived, only few had not been able to report back at the designated time, their status currently still pending. This would be a great opportunity to understand the intentions of the new German regime, but even more importantly their capabilities and limits.

Since these are crumbling or forcibly being reorganised, and hence no matter whether they will provide useful information back to us, we still have to prepare for a worst case scenario. Part of this scenario would have German planes fly over our skies again, just like in Guernica 30 years prior, this time however capable of imposing far worse damage on the fractured union of Iberia. It has therefore been agreed that we will have to expand our current anti-air defences, first this will mean building up more ground infrastructure such as both immobile and mobile defence stations and RADAR, but it should also later include a further increase in the Iberian air force size and interception capabilities therefore. In times such as these we could never be too careful, having those demons in the sky, raining hellfire down upon us may entirely demoralise the whole union into submission."

He briefly noted down some of what he considered to be the key snippets of information being discussed, grinning at his discovery, and when he felt the conversation had run its course continued down the long and dark corridor to a winding flight of stairs. Once outside the impressive, yet severely damaged building he jogged without any rush to a secluded phone box in a side street. As he punched in a certain list of numbers he looked around at the filth that was mounting in the alleyway, things would not be in a great state for a while here, maybe never. A chirpy voice picked up the phone, informing the man that a Mr Canaris was currently not around and whether a message should be left.

In response to the unfolding crisis it was decided in an emergency Caudillo meeting that the refugees should be settled in our lands were we to be seen in a good light on the international stage.

A long speech was given by the Canadian PM once Franco was settled in at Parliament Hill, giving praise to the Caudillo for taking the time to meet with Canada on a personal basis.\n\nDespite the warm greetings and generally friendly attitude, there was something that had been plaguing the trip to Canada since the Caudillo's arrival. One of the major concerns for maintaining a friendship with the Canadians was the ongoing struggle between the Quebecois independence movement and the Canadian government.

Furthermore, the internal conflict is amplified to the global stage by the support given to the Boers by the Reichsprotektorates to their north, setting South Africa to be a potential stage of proxy war between the Reich and the USA.

If we are to recognize the government, it could grant us further ties with the OFN and help us position ourselves with them in this cold war.

The former would allow us to utilize more economies of scale as the Zaibatsus have a larger pool of money to use for development than the Mexicans as well as helping us to draw closer to the Japanese should we want to create stronger ties with them.

The ambassador and his entourage were friendly enough, and offered a tour of the Hungarian capital. To be polite, Salazar gladly accepted. The historical sights were impressive, and it was clear the Hungarians leaned on their legacy for its sightseeing value. After a long while, the tour was concluded. It had taken far longer than anticipated, and only a limited amount of time remained before the state visit was over.\n\nIt was planned that there would be both discussions about commercial and trade affairs, as well as a more publicized meeting between leadership, to be leveraged for public relations. While the opening for a true meeting is past, there is still time to discuss business. If trade deals are not particularly enthusing, then it would still be possible to praise the Hungarian government, in order to thaw the ice for later relations."

Press releases, miscellaneous meetings, and more occupy the Caudillo's day. The most important of these lighter actions was the arranging a higher-up meeting, on short notice, in order to strengthen diplomatic ties. It was only a matter of killing time until then.\n\nOnce the time comes, there will be no time to delay. There needs to be a concise, pre-prepared plan of discussion. Two proposals have taken the spotlight. The meeting could either be about business and trade, establishing further economic ties, or the meeting could be with the king himself. While not as economically profitable, the more personal touch of talking with the king could serve to break the ice, creating the groundwork for further relations."

What Caudillo Franco learned was that, much like Iberia itself, midday was hot, seemingly hostile to life. It was no place fit for staying outside in, for sure, as he took some time off for a siesta. Inside, in the formal environment, the people were as warm as the environment outside. Various affairs, as tedious as they were numerous, filled the day's schedule too far for Franco to properly enjoy the day.\n\nAs the day drags on, there is still time to prepare the greatest meeting of the evening. Saudi oil would undoubtedly be a worthwhile trade, and discussing business in-depth could help in securing an advantageous deal. However, relations could be improved by the classic tactic - flattery. By praising their monarchy, things could warm up between the leadership of both the Saudis and Iberia."

There are opportunities abound in the sub-continent and to have an ally who has access to the natural resources and manpower of India would greatly strengthen Iberia's diplomatic and economic position. We will have to make the decision whether to recognize India or the puppet state Azad Hind as the rightful inheritor of the title of India. India is the stronger of the two but Azad Hind has the might of the Co-prosperity Sphere behind it and a support for their government could lead to further diplomatic opportunities with Japan. Of course, at the same time, we could choose to not recognize either and carry on our policy of neutrality."

Before Franco lies two options: we could definitively say that Iberia will recognize the great Indian republic or we can nod along to what they say and make some vague promises before we make a bee line to Calcutta. A visit to Calcutta would mean throwing away any chance of getting the Indians on side, but Franco has been meaning to try a real Calcuttan biryani..."

We have disregarded the Indians so now it is time for Franco to decide whether we will support the Azad Hind government as the true successor to the mantle of India or whether we will leave India to Indians and back neither government. Naturally, this would mean less opportunities to flex our diplomatic muscle on the global arena but it would mean less chance of potentially getting dragged into a future conflict on the sub-continent."

Since the loss of the Portugese colonies all those years ago, Iberian presence in the far east has been limited however, given the emerging markets that reside within, it is imperative that we return. There is much work to be done and so little time to do it but Franco can and will maintain and forge our diplomatic and economic ties in the pacific. Our mutual hatred of Germany means that fostering relations with the GEACP is top priority.

Franco could get lost in this city but alas, there was work to be done.\n\nWe could talk business with the Japanese and further develop economic ties with the powerful Zaibitzus in an effort to gather more foreign investment back home or we could meet with Iberian community leaders in Japan and show them that their homeland has not forgotten about them.

Franco saw what Japanese occupation had done to the sullen local populace whose faces bore no discernable emotion. Unfortunately, this journey was not for humanitarian efforts but for business and so business is all that shall be discussed.\n\nTalking business with the Chinese could yield many results, as the economic potential for such a large country in terms of population and natural resources could allow Iberian firms to hold onto the coattails of China's imminent meteoric rise. On the other hand, we could meet with the Chinese president [CHI.GetLeader], and further establish diplomatic ties with a country that could become a powerful actor on the world stage, should the Chinese successfully throw off the chains of Japanese domination."

Alternatively, we can meet with the president of Australia, [AST.GetLeader], and establish a clear diplomatic policy with the country. Both have their advantages: furthering economic ties would mean that our investment, both to and from our countries, would be more diversified, shielding us from a potential crash should any other country we've talked fall into economic crisis; whereas further diplomatic ties could be our gateway to the OFN.

Political blocs from across the Union, both great and small, have ensured that their representation within the assembly will be at an absolute maximum. It is time for this landmark assembly of the Iberian Council to commence.\n\nThe assembly opens with the usual legislative formalities, and a quorum is called without a hitch. Shortly thereafter, the Caudillos make their appearance in an awkward tandem as they address the council. The two leaders engage the council with tall talk of prosperity and national greatness. The general reception of their speeches, however, garners little more than a subdued applause.\n\nFollowing several ungainly speeches, shared nearly equally between Franco and Salazar, the two leaders jointly call the deliberations of the council to an open."

The discussions persist with no true progress to display. Bureaucrats continue to take the floor of the assembly, putting forth nothing but safe and unremarkable economic proposals. As the hours progress, the once lively atmosphere of the assembly hall becomes dull and subdued.\n\nThe deadlock is finally broken as a senior member of the technocratic wing speaks. "Gentlemen!" he bellows. "Our union is strained and our economy lies in a disgraceful disarray. Our chosen partners of trade have all but forsaken us, and our abhorrent protectionism impedes any recovery in trade. We dare to attempt to solve our economic concerns alone, but we are failing! Gentlemen, the way forward is clear; we alone cannot solve the economic question. We must implement policies of liberalization!"\n\nAs the man sits, members with ties to the Opus Dei and technocratic blocs rise to their feet and issue an organized and thunderous applause, with many of the more liberal elements of the assembly pitching in. Other elements of the council, however, remain less than enthused. Loud jeers erupt from opposing wings, and many members shout obscenities towards the opposing side. The commotion finally dies down following several calls to order, and the proceedings resume. The Opus Dei continues to put forward detailed plans of economic liberalization, free trade, and a market economy. They argue that despite the loss of state control over economic affairs, the increasingly open Iberian economy would be attractive to investors both internal and external. Furthermore, they go to great lengths to outline the benefits of a renewed Iberian presence in international trade. After lengthy discussion, the Opus Dei conclude their proposals."

It would certainly seem so! Or have they simply forgotten what happened to Iberia when it dared to rely on foreign powers? The lone source for our current disaster is the Iberian reliance upon foreigners to protect our nation and to protect our economy. This must end! This can end! Iberia's path to greatness lies inward! We alone shall be the masters of our economic destiny, not the profiteering foreign fat cats!"\n\nThe assembly hall erupts into a tumultuous roar as nationalist and right wing elements applaud the counter to the liberal ideas. As the excited commotion dies down, the Falangists begin to lay out their plan. With a radical emphasis upon autarky and nationalization, the Falangist proposal outlines an Iberia that relies upon itself and itself only. A nation that possesses near unlimited economic control.

Despite the council being merely advisory, Franco finds that it would be within his best political interest to seriously consider both camps of the debate.

Franco and Salazar recognize that neither man among them carries the political weight behind them to enforce their standpoint upon the other.\n\nThrough the deadlock of lengthy debate emerges a compromise. It is decided that, as the two men are unlikely to come to a decision through personal deliberations, the council shall hold a vote to decide upon the topic. Despite the original intent being for the Iberian Council to remain advisory only, giving it the power to vote upon the economic reform remains the only method of decision the Caudillos have left, save for complete capitulation to the other man. Furthermore, both Franco and Salazar recognize this final opportunity to garner support for their cause, before a final vote is cast.\n\nThe Caudillos exit the secluded room and take to the floor of the assembly. In their approach to the podium, the two men walk shoulder to shoulder, maintaining a nearly visible effort to remain level with one another. Salazar and Franco jointly mount the podium, and together they inform to the assembly of their decision. At a soon to come date, they announce, the Iberian Council will convene to vote upon two options for the economic future of Iberia: the approach of liberalization, or the maintenance of the status quo.

Franco's relinquishment of power to the council has changed that, which means that Iberia has entered a crossroads where the way in which we choose to organise the election has been pushed to the forefront of political discourse.\n\nWhether it be the question of foreign observers or the possible extension of suffrage, the future of Iberian democracy and the Unión Nacional's political hegemony now lies in the halls of the council-chambers with decisions which will shape the lives of Iberians for generations. From the conservatives to the reformists, lines are beginning to be drawn on the questions that we will have to answer in the coming months. A liberal democracy? An authoritarian democracy?

While this would help legitimise whatever party wins and by extension our political system, there are worries amongst many of the more nationalist leaning people that this would infringe on the sovereignty of the nation and potentially give the countries we grant observer status a chance to influence the election.\n\nThat being said, the hard-line reformists demand that we allow total transparency in this upcoming election as the peninsula hasn't seen a free election since the days of the Second Spanish Republic back in 1936, and they fear that authoritarianism could return without these international checks and balances. We could reach a compromise between these two by allowing the observers but in a limited fashion in order to garner a better reputation amongst the democracies of the world."

Representatives from rural areas have asked for disproportionately more ballot boxes than in urban areas because of their worry that there won't be enough to make sure that the people in these small communities can reach them on election day.\n\nHowever, representatives from the urban areas claim that this is unfair; that the current plans for distribution should suffice and that rural representatives are trying to have their areas overrepresented. Regardless of what proposed plan we choose, we will be making either the urban or the rural areas feel threatened by under representation which could turn into apathy from the people who live in these regions, potentially undermining their faith in whatever government is elected."

This has come under heavy fire from the hard-line reformists and would surely outrage the people disenfranchised by it, however the conservatives argue that allowing these people to vote would only lead to instability in our newly christened democracy.\n\nThe radical reformists have declared that suffrage should be expanded to everyone over 18. While they only hold a minority in the council, they seem to have popular support throughout the country, judging by rallies which have been held, visited by tens of thousands, in order to pressure the government to open up the franchise.\n\nThe final proposal, seen as the compromise option between the conservatives and the hard-line reformists, details universal suffrage with an ID registration system.

Using the police would be able to break up any conflicts that could occur, and even act as a deterrent to dissuade troublemakers from showing up. Furthermore, it would be a signal to our citizens that we are truly committed to democracy and encourage them to participate where they otherwise wouldn't have.\n\nIn spite of this, the general consensus among the officials we have put in charge of organising the election is that the fears of voter intimidation are exaggerated, and that the deployment of the Guardia Civil would be a waste of police time and resources which could otherwise be spent elsewhere."

Those sympathetic to the rule of Franco and Caetano wish to actively fund Unión Nacional, through proxies and Swiss bank accounts, to ensure that no other party can match their level of funding. Others have considered using suppression to ensure that no liberal parties can become elected or even become part of a coalition. For these moderates, so long as some kind of conservative party wins, Iberia will be safe and the reforms will be limited.\n\nNaturally, the reformist ideologues have expressed disgust at the thought of illegal funding or suppression of parties and reject the notion that only Unión Nacional can guide this country sufficiently, declaring that only free and fair elections can allow the people of Iberia to choose the direction of their nation democratically."

All of these groups have seen a resurgence since the rallies began, and every day their support grows wider and wider. Many in the council have expressed disgust at the prospect of a liberal or even a socialist government and have considered a media blackout to halt this momentum and prevent what they see as a red tide poised to sweep the nation. Rural representatives have also expressed support at this measure, wishing to keep leftists and cosmopolitan urbanites as far away from their communities as possible.\n\nThe more optimistic within the council have stated their opposition to the blackout, believing that they can beat back their political enemies on the merits of their arguments rather than resorting to dirty tricks and backdoor politics."

With enough propaganda in the right places, we could turn the farmer and villager voting blocs away from Alianza Popular and towards the Unión Nacional and potentially secure victory in the election.\n\nThat being said, many of the moderates in the council have stated their position that an Alianza Popular victory in the election would be satisfactory as we share many of their values. The more liberal minded in the council have proclaimed that there should be no meddling in these areas, and to allow the people of Iberia to choose the government that they wish.

 IBR.450.d:0 "The church bell rang six times. On any other day, there would be a few people meandering around, on their commute to work, but this was not any other day. The announcement of Iberia's first free elections had been made. The jubilation tingled in the air, leaving its mark on anyone who ventured out that day. All the excitement and anticipation that had been built up to the announcement had burst out into a celebration larger than any other in Iberian history. For one day, all peoples in the nation felt united and all differences had been ascended. The old wept at seeing how far the nation had come from the days where collapse felt inevitable. The young finally had the chance to be represented and to choose a government they weren't born into. As the day marched on, the crowds only got bigger, the cheers only got louder, and the spirit of democracy only grew stronger.\n\nFor Franco, this was just another day. He didn't get up early nor did he eat breakfast with any haste. However, as the aging Caudillo left his residence for some air, he saw the crowds. Crowds he had not seen the like of since the victory 31 years ago. He had only reluctantly given additional powers to the council, and throughout this process had gone back and forth on whether it had been a good idea, but seeing the people of his nation cry out with such elation caused a single tear to drop from behind his glasses. Iberia had been saved."

The talk of organizing the election is over and now the practicalities of running an election have begun to take place.\n\nNow that the decisions made by the council in preparing for the elections have begun to take shape, there has been criticism from all sides regarding the handling of the logistical side of things. Some believe that the numbers of police deployed is too much, while some say too it has been too little. Some have stated that not enough ballot boxes were sent to rural areas, while others too many were sent. The old adage, "you can't please everyone" applied to politics seems to be closer to "you can't please anyone".

Currently, minor parties have begun to emerge everywhere as anticipated, but through mergers and arrangements minor parties are taking shape into a few major parties representing the ideological makeup of modern Iberia. At the moment, the parties that seem to be gaining traction are: the socially liberal Unión Republicana, the conservative Alianza Popular, and the economically liberal Partido Renovador Democrático.\n\nThe newfound diversity in the republic has shocked the old guard who believed that many of the views now being openly advocated in the streets had died out under the Caudillos' watch, but to their dismay both the red banner and the flag of the second republic is being paraded around with seemingly no consequences. With the decline of the Unión Nacional, reactionary elements within the party have been provoked to believe that a stronger hand will be needed to guide the UN to victory in the election."

This made the Unión Republicana's decision to outline their plans for minority representation in the city a clear sign of their commitment to the cause of peaceful devolution. The rally itself was rather short, but the speech was almost drowned out by the cheers. Once the rally was over, brawls sporadically broke out across the city between Galician nationalists and unionists. City officials denounced the UR speakers for "incitement of violence" and "disturbing the peace". Torcuato Fernández-Miranda has refused to acknowledge the denouncement, staying committed to the slogan of "Freedom and Autonomy for all of Iberia's children!"\n\nThese words would have gotten any man imprisoned mere months ago, but has now become the rallying cry for the up and coming Unión Republicana; a party dedicated to reducing inequality, empowering Iberia's minorities, and seeing that the process of democratisation is brought to its natural conclusion. The party has seen widespread support in urban centers, from moderate minority nationalist movements, and from the most hard-line reformists in the council. Promising a total break from the policies of the past, will they be able to muster enough for support for such a radical agenda?"

We, as the Alianza Popular, vow to not only halt this menace, but reverse the degradation and make Iberians proud of their nation once more."\n\n– Manuel Fraga Iribarne, Leader of Alianza Popular.\n\nFollowing the Unión Republicana rally in Galicia, Fraga has released a scathing article in the conservative ABC newspaper targeting Fernández-Miranda and his party. Criticising their "inflammatory anti-Iberian language" and "highly idealistic and unrealistic policies", the article has inflamed public opinion with its use of divisive language. To accompany the article, Fraga has released their manifesto in which the policy positions of Alianza Popular were showcased. As expected, it calls for aggressively combatting terrorism, maintaining a unitary style of government, and strengthening of the bond between the church and the state. Naturally, this has come under heavy fire from the liberals who claim that Alianza Popular wish to maintain the status quo at a time when reform is needed, with conservatives arguing they only wish to preserve what makes Iberia great."

Whether this call will fall on deaf ears remains to be seen but the publicity around the stunt has given the PRD a boost in the polls and has propelled them to the lead for the title of the main center party with their emphasis on the civility needed in politics.\n\nPromising a focus on economic liberalization along with vague promises on social reform, the Partido Renovador Democrático has managed to gain the support from the urban business leaders and the money that comes along with them. Given the stagnation that occurred under the Caudillos' rule, their message of adopting a laissez faire approach has resonated with many of the people most affected by the pitfalls of the old economic system, and the more measured tone on social issues could mean that the PRD stands to poach voters off both Alianza Popular and Unión Republicana.

The growth of the liberals in the Partido Renovador Democrático and Unión Republicana have pushed the two parties together in an alliance in hopes that by working as one, they can avoid splitting the vote and secure victory in the election.

The UN had seemed like the obvious choice if any extrajudicial funding would be needed, but some in the government feel like they have fallen too far to be saved, even with covert support. Instead, there has been a proposal to fund the Alianza Popular as they have been seen as having a strong chance in winning the election. Although there are some differences in policies between the two, Alianza Popular is still a conservative party opposed to the liberals, and therefore broadly agree with the vision of the Unión Nacional. They could for this reason be the key to preventing liberal influence from disturbing the status quo.\n\nThat being said, some have stated their opposition to any election tampering and wish to ensure that the people of Iberia get to choose their own government, whether that be a liberal or conservative one."

However, it would be costly to be able to print enough ballots in time for the election as printing houses would have to be subsidized to work overtime.\n\nThat being said, it is not immediately certain that the amount by which we would be able to print will fall short of the demand. Should there only be a few thousand people who do not have a ballot, there is a chance that the press wouldn't pick it up and we could avoid the cost.

The size of the crowds on this momentous occasion dwarf the ones seen when the election was first announced and while the feelings of excitement still remain, there is something else accompanying it that wasn't there before. A feeling of unspoken trepidation. Questions that plagued the mind of the average Iberian. What if it all went wrong? What if all of this was for nothing and the old regime remains, rebranded for a new decade? There were celebrations from dusk till dawn but that anxiety hung over like a stalactite ready to fall at any moment, ready to spear their newfound liberty.\n\nAntonio, Isabella, Leo, and Gabriella could not have less in common. What common ground does a bureaucrat, a student, a banker, and a nun share? Usually very little, but today they all felt that feeling in their stomach. As they gripped their secret ballot, they were united in the foreboding apprehension about their country's future. No words were exchanged but they all shared in the comfort of each other's worried glances. If the future were to be bleak they wouldn't face it alone, but together.\n\nWhile in power, it'd be easy to say that Franco could never really connect with his people and understand their plight but even he could feel the uneasiness in the air. The people wanted reform, that he had been sure of but if they didn't get it, what would they do? Who would face the wrath of the disillusioned masses? Franco was many things but clueless was not one of them and he realized how his position, however ceremonial it may be, could be the target of populist outrage. After coming to this conclusion, he had decided to visit the Cathedral of his hometown of Ferrol for the remainder of the day to pray for everything to work out as intended."

Both Unión Republicana and the Partido Renovador Democrático have both made statements denouncing the government for using voter suppression by proxy to intimidate their voter base.\n\nThe government's response aimed to highlight how they could not know that there would be voter suppression occurring and that their models did not predict anything requiring extra police officers to be stationed at poll booths.

While there had been recent reports that city officials were riling up their constituents to vote, the measures taken by the government were thought to be enough to keep them at bay.\n\nThis was wrong and these same measures were actually used to propagandize against the government which has severely limited the ability of Unión Nacional and Alianza Popular to secure the election. Reports are flooding in, showing that the average urban turnout is well above the average turnout in the rural areas. Not only will this damage the reputation of the Unión Nacional for this election, but has the ability to be used as a bludgeon against them for the elections yet to come.

That being said, the loudest cheers of all can be heard from their party headquarters on General Martínez Campos Street along with the popping of champagne as the officials who worked so hard to ascertain this victory can now, if briefly, relax.\n\nBoth the party president, Fernández-Miranda, and general secretary, Sá Carneiro, have prepared speeches for this victory and have gathered crowds in Madrid's Plaza Mayor to lay out their plans for Iberia in the coming years.\n\nFernández-Miranda's speech focused on how important these next few years will be in ensuring that Iberian democracy does not backslide back into their authoritarian past and that his determination to make sure of this has only grown stronger due to this historic victory. Some journalists have suggested that the wording of the speech suggests that he intends to resign once this objective is done but there has been no official statement on the matter.\n\nAfter Fernández-Miranda was done, Sá Carneiro took the stage and took a more policy based approach in his speech, calling for three "E's" to be implemented "Establecer, expandir e eliminar": the "establishment of a provincial autonomy system"; "expanding civil rights''; and "eliminating the ghost of the Caudillos that haunt Iberia's political system".

He couldn't help but feel like the only one to pick up on this persistent tone in his speech and the lack of any negative response worried him. Even after the speech ended, he had gone to talk to some of his colleagues who didn't seem to pick up on it.

Due to the fact that these arms were earmarked for the Federal Army, which is rather shoddily equipped in this sector, getting to the bottom of this supply leak is of utmost importance.\n\nSeveral leads have been noticed, and can be pursued, including access records to the secure area of the warehouses, the guard shifts, and, if worst comes to worst, some worrying accounts of separatist activity in the area. As this is Catalonia, it's very possible that nearly any force could be involved.\n\nAdditionally, due to the lack of damage on the buildings or storage areas, it is very possible that the force causing the arms disappearances has one or more men on the inside.

What was found within the tunnel is greatly concerning.\n\nThere were numerous obvious signs of recent habitation, including used food tins, radios, old rifles, and a neatly dug waste disposal pit. Most concerningly, however, is the conetents of an old uniform coat that was left hanging on a chair. Inside its pockets was an old medallion inscribed with the symbol of the CNT-FAI, an anarchist organization that has been a constant thorn in our side since the days of the Civil War.\n\nIf the CNT-FAI is involved in this manner, it can only mean one thing. They are organizing, and they are organizing for a violent revolution. It is imperative that we get to the bottom of this matter as soon as possible, as the arms shipments themselves are still missing, and only God knows what the terrorists could be doing with them right now."

Background checks also failed to reveal anything of note - the Guardia Civil officers charged with guarding the area are apparently all entirely loyal, with no history of corruption at all.\n\nThe access records were also useless, as there is simply no way for anyone to remove crates of guns and anti-tank munitions without being detected by outside forces. Whatever is going on here is clearly either a legal matter for the local police, or a simple bureaucratic error.\n\nThus, it is best to either kick the issue down to the locals or drop it, and instead focus on preventing anomalous situations like this from happening again, be it through greater security or bureaucratic reform."

Several fireteams have been sent into the city proper, to sweep for insurgent hideouts, and attempt to strike back against the leftist threat proactively.\n\nIn a rousing speech before the main square of the city, Major José Delgadillo reminds his small force, as well as several civilians, of the atrocities committed by the CNT-FAI in the past. Gravely, he held up photographs of bombed churches, dead priests, and desecrated saintly relics.\n\n'Whatever it takes', he says, 'to rid this city of the murderous anarchist scum, is justified in our quest to make Iberia safe and free from this degenerate behavior.'\n\nThe officer wishes his men good hunting, and orders them to apprehend or eliminate any potential threat they run across.

With several officers wounded and one dead, the Guardia Civil cease this operation, and instead regroup in numerous precinct houses scattered throughout downtown Barcelona.

As nighttime rains wash the blood and broken glass into the city's gutters, the police continue their raids.\n\nDespite resistance, it seems that they are closing in on the source of the city's woes, and many law-abiding citizens hope that they will be done with their duty by the end of the week."

It was all they could do at this point short of raiding every single building in the city. However, after launching a few more of these raids, it was obvious that they were just falling back into their prior pattern.

Several detonations were visible as the Guardia Civil closed into the location, of which were enough to nearly total several buildings. Given the status of the survivors of the attack, the investigation would have to proceed without their testimony, as they were still recovering from their injuries. It was later found that the power of explosion required to damage the structure of the buildings in the complex was far higher than the ordinance produced - suggesting that another, stronger explosive was used in order to damage the facility. Furthermore, very little of the finished product remained, destroyed or otherwise, leading one to conclude that it was taken en masse.\n\nThe political effect of this destruction was disastrous. With new ammunition and supplies at least one terrorist group has been freshly equipped, and they most likely have shared it with fellow separatists. What's worse is the perception of the government. Made confident by the knowledge that we cannot even defend a munitions complex, many separatist groups have been emboldened to act against us."

Reports indicated that the group had access to weapons considered 'far above their status', almost considered military-grade. In order to finally beat back the CNT forces the army had to be called in to restore order to part of the city. Even though their presence has been beaten back, some hold-outs still remain to be flushed out.\n\nAs was simply part of the fighting protocol, beating back the separatists took a large amount of time and was very costly in collateral damage. No favors have been earned with the population of the city, who resent the naturally unpleasant counter-terrorist tactics. It has also a cause for much concern, as their ability to acquire such high-grade equipment means that they have infiltrated the government."

Casualties, which include government workers and civilians, are believed to be in the dozens, with the number of injured at least three times as high as rescue workers continue to pull people and bodies from the smoldering wreckage.\n\nIn addition to showcasing some woeful incompetence on the part of local police for somehow failing a spot check this badly, the incident also sent the Iberian government into a state of panic, as they had almost no clue who carried out this attack or why. Cordoba wasn't a separatist zone, nor was it a hotbed of extremist activity, that is unless they've seriously been overlooking the city's affairs, which was unlikely.\n\nIt was not until a transmission came through on state tv that the anti-separatist division would figure out who was responsible. At 3:15, a regular state news broadcast was suddenly interrupted by a new signal, showcasing the blurry image of a man sitting in a basement, his face concealed by a ski mask. Claiming that these attacks were carried out on the behalf of the BTA, the mysterious man suddenly began shouting angrily, launching into what can only be described as a lunatic tirade against "the ruling class" and "forces of reaction", coupled with some very violent and explicit threats against the government.\n\nTransmission was cut off after less than five minutes, but the entire nation is stunned. The simple fact that a separatist group was able to launch a coordinated attack, let alone one of this magnitude, outside of their home region is proof that they are far more widespread than previously thought.

It seems that they regard even their fellow Portuguese citizens as poorly as they do the "Iberian occupiers", if they remain indifferent to their radical cause. Unconfirmed reports have it that membership is increasing simply due to fear of being targeted next, and with ordinary civilians in their numbers they will be increasingly capable of sabotage and terrorism."

 IBR.577.d:0 "Lisbon, in addition to being the capital city of Portugal, is also the location of the main broadcasting center for the Portuguese language version of state controlled news. Unlike the headquarters in Madrid, where the news was broadcast in Castilian Spanish and the newsrooms filled with shouting and commotion, the Lisbon headquarters tended to be on the calmer side.\n\nAt least, until today...\n\nNobody is quite sure how they managed to pull it off. Some claim that they were undercover agents working for the state news for months waiting for the right time, others claim that they were recent converts to the cause, while the official Madrid line is that the terrorists impersonated low level janitors and secretaries to infiltrate the building. Whatever the case, the building was overwhelmed with the sounds of gunfire and terrified shrieks around 8 am, punctuated by the occasional splat and sickening thud.\n\nIberia, and indeed soon the world, would become very much aware as the FSLP terrorists who had taken control of the building used their position to broadcast live on state television, for millions to see. There, in a room littered with corpses and the miserable hunched over forms of terrified employees, a masked spokesperson for the terrorists delivered what was in effect their manifesto. There were no bombastic nationalistic proclamations, nor was there any harshness to his tone; the masked man delivered their grievances to a live audience with a surprising lack of emotion, even as the demands turned into direct threats on innocent lives. At some point about fifteen minutes in, the masked man and his cohorts decided that they had said all that they needed to, and in one last show of brutality executed all remaining employees on camera with a bullet to the head.\n\nBy the time anti-separatist forces arrived the terrorists had managed to make a clean getaway, leaving behind a newsroom in disarray and piles upon piles of corpses. If their manifesto is any indication, the FSLP does not plan on slowing up on these heinous acts until their demands for a free Portugal are fully met."

At an initial examination, there was no correlation between the victims other than being in public and not secure. However, a later look into the case revealed that the victims all shared two common factors - they were in the Iberian administration, and they were all Spanish. As this follows the modus operandi of a Portuguese separatist group, it is safe to assume they were the party at fault.\n\nEven though the culprits are narrowed down and justice is inevitable, the damage they dealt is unavoidable. Many Spanish officials are afraid that they'll be next, and between fearing for their lives and doing their jobs little is being done. The blow to the governmental efficiency is severe, and has greatly diminished productivity."

 IBR.593.d:0 "There has been a regional blackout in the services of the Axencia in northern Portugal. Taking the men entirely by surprise, a terrorist group struck directly at the regional headquarters, using firearms far more powerful than intelligence had suggested. Not only did they have such high-grade weaponry, but they were capable of hiding their firepower from the watching eye of the Axencia, too. Understandably, the agents present were not prepared for a separatist group to strike the anti-separatist forces at their own base of operations. The complex was designed around such an eventuality, and with these pre-built fortifications the separatist defeat was inevitable. They didn't let this stop them, though - the fight they put up was reportedly fierce, with only two or three terrorists not fighting to the death.\n\nIt would be fine if this didn't turn out to be a diversion. An unknown agent allowed a group of separatists access to the facilities, and they made off with records, weaponry, and intelligence. As undercover agents are smothered out and depots raided with the newfound data on them, the Axencia has been busy finding their leaking part. The upper half of Portugal will remain vulnerable until an audit is completed, the loose thread is cut, and new connections are established."

According to the reports of security guards on-scene, a disturbance was responded to, which turned out to be little more than a large distraction. A struggle had begun in the building they were guarding, which had been infiltrated while a diversion was occurring. Their arrival was too late, as the insurgents had defeated the guards and shockingly massacred the staff. When they were intercepted they were in the process of starting a fire on a pile of documents. Even though the terrorists were defeated once their presence had been identified, the guards lacked the means to put out the fire they had started. When it was put out it had burnt through much of the present paperwork.\n\nThe damage goes without saying. Even though much of the lost documentation can be restored in time, it is time exactly that cannot be spared. Since it was a large amount, it will take a large sum of time to replace it all. The time spent replacing papers is time that cannot be spent fighting off terrorists, and they have taken gleeful notice of the fact."

Our ceaseless raids, arrests and other policing actions have proven too much for the treacherous reds, and what few terrorists remain have scattered to the winds.\n\nThis has been our hardest-won victory by far; support for the anarcho-syndicalist movement has never died in Catalonia, giving the traitors no shortage of refuge and material support. The workers of Barcelona were a particularly difficult obstacle to surmount in our pursuit of the CNT, but no task is beyond the capabilities of the AAS.\n\nPerhaps with their armed wing broken, the Catalan anarchists will see the futility of their cause and abandon it for good.

However, we can now rest easy, as the AAS has finally secured the last of their mountain bases in the Basque Country.\n\nMonths have passed since we began to push back the ETA in earnest. Their martial capabilities almost matched those of the AAS, and it was only with military assistance that the terrorists were defeated in open battle. But for all their ferocity, they lacked the manpower and popular organic support to withstand our relentless assaults.\n\nThough our victory is cause for celebration, there are many questions that remain unanswered; primarily, the question of their material support. The ETA never enjoyed widespread support among the population of their homeland, and the amount of hardware at their disposal was suspiciously high for a terrorist organization.

Sympathizer and isolated cells may remain, but this should be the end of them as a cohesive and effective organization.\n\nNow that they are free from both communist propaganda and the threat of violence, perhaps the mines and factories of the north can return to their usual level of productivity.

The Portuguese branch of the AAS, however, had studied all their moves and learned their devious tricks. Come the final assault, there was nothing the reds could do to escape justice.\n\nAt long last, the green and red of the Portuguese flag can fly happily alongside that of Iberia.

That was no surprise, of course- they had a majority, enough so that the programs failing would be more of a surprise than their success. Of course, those who were against the new - or perhaps the renewed old - autonomy were a talkative lot. The Francoists had a talent for never shutting up, especially when their military buddies were in earshot. They were definitely in earshot this time, as Adolfo Suarez was forced to discover when he was strongarmed into meeting a representative officer.\n\n"What the hell were you thinking!?" The sergeant screamed at him, with a fury Suarez had never seen before. "Even- Without even what I was sent here for, I want to know what the fuck you were thinking!? Do you want to kill this fucking country?"\n\nAdolfo, despite how hard he tried to keep a respectable face, was this close to wavering under the pressure placed on him.

I can't blame you, but I would like you to understand that your support is very important to getting the support we need. So, the reason you're here is that I would like you to talk to me. Tell me everything you want done, all of your demands, and which are the most important."\n\nThe regionalist was incredulous. "You'll comply with a list of demands if I vouch for you?"\n\n"Why else are we here? Our transcriber will note down everything you say, then we'll go over it."\n\nEach local leader was a few days after the other.

That was good, since getting someone else to do it would come off poorly.\n\nThe Basque spoke of things that were popular, Carneiro knew, because he had written the speech for just this occasion. He watched the Basque speak of freedom, of liberty, of the right to exist as Basque, not Spanish. Carneiro inhaled on the dramatic pause, held his breath, then exhaled as it moved on to the freedom of language.\n\nWhen the crowd cheered after the fact, he took heart that maybe, just maybe, the whole diarchy could be a bad chapter of history.\n\n"I can tell you caused this!" screamed a military official, who had coincidentally been present for the speech.

 IBR.610.d:0 "The farmers who populate much of the rural areas of Iberia may be, in some regards, blessed. Regarded as the ideal lifestyle by the Francoists, the farmers of the country were often pandered to. Even during autarky, the effects of which were lessened by their self-sufficient nature, the farmers were pampered and had little reason to support other groups - this continues to today, where they are a secure opposition voting bloc.\n\nThe farmers do not support us, and perhaps this is not entirely unwarranted. We are perceived as an elitist group, the dreadful sort which exclusively supports urban areas (as opposed to the dreadful sort that pandered to rurals before us), and as painful as it is to admit, we are in many ways overly favoring our voting bloc, the urban areas. Even though the way to fix this is fairly obvious, the party is split between three opposing factions on this matter, each supporting a different resolution.\n\nThe first and second groups both wish to effectively buy over the farmers using benefits dedicated to them, though they diverge in what benefits specifically to give. The first wishes to use farming equipment, increasing the effectiveness of the farmers and intending to use that favor to acquire supporters. The second wishes to use less direct means, using subsidies to show that we have not forgotten them. The third, and final, faction does not want to do anything. They argue the farmers are a lost cause, and attempts to buy them would be pointless waste.\n\nWhich idea will the leadership favor?"

As horrible as working with them is, it is a necessary evil until the time comes where they may be defanged.\n\nFrancisco Balsemao will be sent to meet with the higher echelons of the Axencia.

Do you have a lighter?" He was handed a lighter, and a cigarette, and took a few moments to cherish a puff. Then he began to speak again. "Now, let us begin our meeting. I am sure you can understand me through a smoke..."\n\nThe man proved to be an eloquent speaker, and the dance of words between two men who made the act an art was a sight to behold. The men spoke for around an hour, around which the meeting concluded and both went their separate ways.\n\nHe was sold. Pleased with our moderation, the official was more than willing to put in a good word in the Axencia, for they greatly appreciated our commitment to ensuring the state evolved at a controlled pace.

"I'll pass. Smoking in the conference room is poor manners."\n\n"As you say," Francisco responded. "Let's get started with the meeting, if you are ready...?"\n\nThe man was very blunt. He spoke honestly, but he spared nothing for politeness. It was almost respectable, his commitment to curt conversation. He informed Balsemao, in no uncertain terms, that the Axencia was concerned. They were concerned with the progression of the state.\n\n"It would grow out of control, and swallow the country in bureaucracy and waste," the man argued. Even more so, they were scared for their own future. "Is it unreasonable to want to protect your livelihood?" Yet.. this meeting was a promising sign.

Because of all of it, several undoubtedly involved individuals have made very persuasive arguments to stop the investigation.\n\nGiving up will without a doubt stop our efforts here. What's shocking is that this may not even be the worst possible occurrence. We could always just continue on with the investigation, trying even harder to reach the evidence that is surely just out of our grasp, but this would make us dangerous enemies.

If we have any say on the matter - which we do - that will end today.\n\nAs is the case with every political matter in this country, there is a wealth of options before us on how to handle the municipalities.

One of our promises was to unban these leftist groups, securing their support in creating a new Iberia. Now that we are in power, they expect us to make good on our promises and unban them.\n\nIt would be very easy - just a few strokes of a pen - to do so, but the political ramifications would be severe.

It's hard to tell if the previous regime even tried to monitor what happened in those prisons, as abuses and violations of rights were so common that it created a reputation for brutality. Franco would simply throw a dissident into the prison and let them die - which was far from an impossible occurrence. We cannot let people be incarcerated in such conditions anymore.\n\nThe best way to lessen the issue immediately is to remove the people committing these atrocities. There are many problematic guards, used to not facing consequences for their actions, as well as those who are so adept at torture that they are better called torturers. If we arrested them all, then we could stop many abuses that could happen. However, we may upset the military by being indiscriminate, which could be dangerous. To that end, we could easily justify only arresting the most heinous offenders."

 #Close Down Tarrafal
 IBR.620.t:0 "The Matter of Tarrafal"
 IBR.620.d:0 "Tarrafal. A prison designed to hold the most troublesome of dissidents. A prison designed to break their spirits by any means necessary, a grinder of souls. It was made to be inescapable, situated on the island of Cape Verde, far away from the Iberian mainland. In an ideal world, we could just tear the prison down and put up a monument to the people it has killed. Since it is far from an ideal world, some tact will be required.\n\nThe commander of the prison was largely left to his own devices by Franco, and attempting to chafe on that autonomy may anger him. Since he is in a fortified location, out at sea, with plenty of provisions, his anger would be an incredible blow to an already unpopular decision - for Franco made sure to intertwine his brutality with Iberian pride. With the right pressure, the commander could be pushed to ending the worst of his excesses, which would still be a victory, if admittedly a minor one."

 IBR.806.t:0 "Tarrafal Camp Commandant Refuses To Stand Down!"
 IBR.806.d:0 "The worst has come to pass! The camp commander, angered by our decision, has refused our directives! He has stated that he will "not allow the end of justice in Iberia", and opted to instead make his stand by beginning to hole up within Tarrafal. Negotiations are pointless, as he has mentioned that he will not negotiate, only allowing access to the prison again if he totally achieves his way.\n\nA siege on Tarrafal, of all places, would be political suicide. There must not be a siege, so there are only two options to end this charade: A surgical strike, and the unthinkable. A squad of soldiers may be able to apprehend the commander before he can fortify, sending the pyramid tumbling down. However, if they fail, then the consequences will be truly severe. Otherwise, we would need to concede to the man. It would be a horrible loss of face, but better than what a failure would do."

 IBR.807.d:0 "The commander, when confronted with our order, complied fully. Stating that he recognized the changes in policy and wished to adapt to them, he resigned from the position and granted us full access to Tarrafal. Most guards complied as well. Tarrafal is being wiped away currently, and its prisoners have been released or transferred accordingly. With the monster itself gone, all that remains is the man behind the slaughter.\n\nThe warden was the man responsible for the state of Tarrafal, creating the system which allowed it to grow as it did. In spite of his evils, there are some in the government who wish for him to be granted a pardon for his deeds - as if running a death camp was a deed. If we kept him free, it would please them... but is this really a man to keep free?"

 IBR.621.d:0 "In what is perhaps the most frightening act of our careers, we have prepared an investigation into the military. It should be obvious that the military still holds significant power, and attracting their ire could spell the end of far more than just our party. This being said, we could go a long way towards defanging the military if we provide a little extra evidence of corruption into the investigation's results, though this will go poorly if there isn't plenty already. If we intentionally probe lightly with the investigation, it could open up negotiations and help ease relations - provided they trust us still.\n\nWe must be decisive, remain committed to our choice, and remember that we will not get a second chance at this.

"As you say!" His hands dropped back onto his legs, where they had been resting. "With the recent corruption investigation, I- and my party- think that we have been on the wrong foot. I am he-"\n\n"No." The man in the middle crossed his arms, a scowl like few others upon his face. "My comrades-in-arms and I are an honorable lot. We do not make deals with someone inclined to break it for petty gains. Your-" he spat the word with a remarkable venom, "party seems more inclined to make gains, not cooperate, so cooperation is not going to happen.

Between puffs, he began to speak.\n\n"What is it that you arranged this meeting for?"\n\n"Given the recent investigation, señor, my party believes we have started off on the wrong foot. We wish to take this chance to arrange a relationship that benefits both groups."\n\nThe officer stared at him, with a look slightly more attentive than before. "Of course. Do you have a list, or should we take it from the top?"\n\nHaving brought in a receptive bunch, Balsemao was pleased to learn that the military, too, was relieved by the prospect of talking things over. With a more functional relationship prepared, it seemed like the country would be just a little bit less hostile."

 #Find Who We Can Trust
 IBR.622.t:0 "Securing Political Connections"
 IBR.622.d:0 "A country like Iberia is hardly the place for a liberal-oriented party. Having been under the tight leash of a regime - two, arguably - which sought to eliminate all political opposition, nearly every echelon of society is staffed with despots, lackeys, and yes men seeking to maintain their power no matter what. For a party like ours, who wishes to move beyond this dark era, these men are often dangerous and unwavering enemies. To throw away help in a situation like this is to prepare our noose.\n\nOur help is, to put it diplomatically, whoever we can find. There are still many moderates in Iberian politicians. Whether they are veterans who have cooled over the years or young dissidents, it does not matter. If we can secure these connections, then defeating the Francoists will be much simpler."
 IBR.622.a:0 "Then get to it!"
 
 IBR.5854.t:0 "Tension Looms"
 IBR.5854.d:0 "To assume that a moderate would be inclined to support us is a mistake. Those under the term are remarkably variable, but most importantly the veterans - those with influence - are rather conservative. Even though they want to move on from Franco, they wish to do so in a less radical way than ours. We have learned from insider information that many of these veterans are skeptical of our policies, opposing its implementation for one reason or another.\n\nAre they still worth trying to court? If we were to make concessions, there are fair odds they would go along with the show of cooperation. This asks another question, though: How much is their support worth? When does the aid become less than what we lose from corrupting our platform?"

 IBR.5855.d:0 "While none could deny that we certainly tried to court much of the old guard, many would agree we went a step beyond that. To a level that was downright pandering, we made one concession after another in attempting to gain the trust of those who were, in hindsight, manipulating us. The charade probably would have continued indefinitely until someone decided enough was enough. All these dealings were leaked to the media.\n\nSwooping in like birds of prey, the media outlets exposed our dealings to the rest of the country, and more importantly towards those we tried to reach. We are like a joke to them now - who would work with a party when there was only one spine between them? So thoroughly compromising our values for the sake of support seems to have also alienated some among our own, too."

 IBR.5856.t:0 "Moderate Veterans Step Forward"
 IBR.5856.d:0 "Given just the right amount of political handiwork, our deeds have finally been noticed. The moderate veterans, the best-aged segment of Franco's regime, have seen us as a worthy cause. With due note to their collective opportunism - if we were not elected they would not give us the time of day - it was very easy to create an effective and comprehensive political alliance. It is certainly a great step up for our power, but should we really show it?\n\nWe could announce our new alliance publicly, as a way of showing the military that we are not to be trifled with. It could cow them, but it might also do just the opposite if it is handled poorly. Should we keep it private, then we could avoid any adverse relationship with the military and give them no reason to act against us. What will it be?"

Instead of silencing the military, the speech seems to have made them more talkative! They speak of intervention, concern, and of "proclaiming our dishonest motives"...

No matter the officer it greeted, none seemed to be particularly inflamed by the alliance. There was little offense to be had in a private alliance.

"Whatever. If we can make it onto a flight, we can disappear in the States."\n\nOn the way to the airport, they beheld military. Not their military.\n\n"Play it cool," said the second officer, "they have no reason to suspect us."\n\nOn their way to the airport, they found that they were suspected. What was supposed to be a cursory inspection turned into far more, and by the end of the proceedings one was unconscious and the other was in handcuffs. They were identified, placed into custody, and sent off to Madrid."

There's not a rat's chance in hell they know us. Don't you see yourself?" The second officer replied, gesturing to the thoroughly modified appearances they had taken as disguises. "Stay calm, and all they'll see are civvies."\n\nThey were immediately suspected. One of the guards present appeared to see through the disguises immediately. He shot them a quick salute, then waved them through.\n\n"All I see here is a patriotic Iberian citizen." said the guard, his voice low but quick. "Isn't that right, Hernandez?"

Given the current state of Madrid, it is what legal professionals would call an open-and-shut case. It will likely be a short trial, for they have no hope of opposing the evidence against them. The only uncertain part is how they will be sentenced.\n\nThrough political maneuvering, we have great influence in the punishment the officer cabal will receive. Normally, an act of this magnitude would be punished with death. However, if we wanted to use this opportunity to reconcile with the remaining military elements, then "just" a life sentence will serve to show that we can still forgive."

In the middle of the parade was the former government, broken men still in their suits, displayed as if they were wild animals in a zoo.\n\nThe old government was led through the city, in full display of the crowds gathered upon the sidewalks of the streets, to the former House of Deputies. There, under the gaze of the Francoist flag, many of the politicians were lined up, including Fernández-Miranda, Balsemao, Suarez - who had to be tied down from how hard he kicked and fought - and Carneiro.\n\n"You are lucky not to be crucified!" screamed the officer in front.\n\n"Ready!"\n\n"Aim!"\n\nWith only one more word, the dream of a democratic Iberia died."

With their surrender, the military officers at the head of the coup have lost any momentum they once had. Their credibility has evaporated, and they will not be able to muster anything like this again.\n\nThere is still the status of the traitors to consider. They did not surrender with the rest of their troops, and still desire to return to menace us. We must deal with them, as only their capture can totally put this treason to rest.

While their locations were unknown - as the battle was still raging when they fled - their true intent was revealed not long after.\n\nThey have issued a pronunciamento against the government, calling upon the larger military to aid them in toppling our government. Unfortunately, our military being what it is, most of them have deserted us to join the fascists. It is a fact of human history that some things never change, and it looks like the old Spanish habits will die hard.

 IBR.5400.t:0 "The Beginning of Rationing"
 IBR.5400.d:0 "It has become obvious to the government, given the oil crisis afflicting the nation, that it is imperative that an oil rationing system needs to be put in place following our inability to import enough oil for the excessive demand. While there have been prominent voices within the opposition detailing their problems with an oil rationing system and how it might affect the ability of firms to manufacture goods that require oil, the government intends to press on, in order to make sure everyone has at least some oil and oil based products for their day to day lives.\n\nWhat the government has not decided on, is how strict this rationing should be. The first proposal has been a very harsh rationing system to thoroughly ensure that the country does not run out what little oil it has left in its reserves. However, some members of the cabinet have stated their hesitation with the measure warning that it is too strict and could cause the government's approval to tank considering the central oil has in both people's daily lives and the economy as a whole."

 IBR.5401.d:0 "While the New Economic Program is centered around the need to address the working people of this nation, some measures will be needed to address the inflation that occurs when utilizing stimulus spending to offset this economic crisis. It is for this reason, that the government has seen fit to raise interest rates in order to curtail consumer and business spending. While this will impede the economy's ability to grow, the threat of rising inflation and even potentially hyperinflation means that it is something that has to be endured if the government's plan to weather the storm is to succeed.\n\nIn spite of this, our in-house economists are divided on how much to raise interest rates with the two main camps based around raising the rates from 6% to either 9% or 15%. The proponents of the former increase state that raising them too high will paralyze the country's economy and make spending so unlikely that the economy will continue to plummet whereas the proponents of the latter claim that 9% wouldn't impede spending enough to cause inflation to decrease claiming that the average Iberian would soon their currency become useless. Both arguments could lead the country down a road of economic ruin and by extension, an unmitigated defeat in the next election so we have to pray to both God and Keynes that the right decision is made here."

 IBR.5402.d:0 "With our economy beginning to get back on track, it's time to address the growing issue of how the government intends to pay back the debt from both the previous administration and from what has been accrued in lifting the country out of the economic crisis. The question of debt repayment begins with who we intend to pay back, as there is substantial debt from both domestic and international lenders who both want their money plus interest back as soon as possible.\n\nOne thing that cannot be ignored is that the government must pay back the debt from the domestic lenders due to the fact that ignoring them would be political suicide and would weaken the government's credibility with small and large businesses operating in Iberia. However, whether the government can afford to pay back the foreign debt still remains up in the air, as the means by which we could afford to pay them back would certainly require a further tax hike which would be immensely unpopular and further inhibit our economic growth. That being said, a refusal to pay these international lenders back would result in eroded confidence from foreign firms and an even bigger bill when we are in a situation to pay them back due to the interest that will have accrued."

Luckily, the average Iberian has managed to stay afloat during these turbulent times through our use of stimulus spending and welfare programs. It is important that we remember that we cannot leave this recession unless all peoples of Iberia have been raised up and no longer go hungry, no longer be forced to live paycheck to paycheck, no longer be punished for the mistakes the top 1% make."\n\nWhile the members of the "top 1%" didn't seem to like Fernández-Miranda's TV speech, the "average Iberian" seemed to love it and the Unión Republicana has seen a steady increase in the polls as a result of it. The mixture of presenting hope for the future with populist messaging about the rich has really struck a chord with the working class and rallies in the urban areas since the speech have seen a dramatic increase in turnout. The response from these people have made it clear, they are behind Fernández-Miranda and Unión Republicana, all the way."

 IBR.623.d:0 "Alejandro Rodríguez de Valcárcel spoke to the Iberian people through radio and television.\n\n"Iberians, Franco has died tonight. This exceptional man who before God and History, has took upon himself the responsibility of the hardest and most selfless service to Iberia, following throughout his whole life, day by day, hour by hour his transcendental mission. I know my voice will arrive in your residence being constantly interrupted by my tears and constant sobbing; it is natural to feel this way the tremendous pain his absence brings to us. It is a moment of extreme sadness, but we must not become hopeless, it is true that Franco, our Caudillo for so many years, is not among us but he left us his work, his example and the fulfillment of an historic duty. I was witness of his last day of work, when Death had already taken her toll at his heart and I can guarantee you that this was his last message to the people he loved so much:\n\nNow that the time is near for me to stand in judgment before God Almighty, I ask that He look kindly upon me since I have striven to live and to die as a good Catholic. It has always been my desire to be a faithful son of the church, I ask forgiveness from all, as I give my most heartfelt forgiveness to those who declared themselves my enemies. I believe and hope that had no enemies other than those who were enemies of Iberia. Iberia, which I will love until the last moment and which I promised to serve until my dying breath, which is near. Do not forget that the enemies of Iberia and of Christian civilization are watching, and you should also be watchful and should lay aside all personal gain in favor of the goals and interests of our homeland and of the Iberian people. Continue striving to obtain social justice and education for all Iberians and make use of the rich multiplicity of its regions as a fountain of strength for a continued united Iberia. I would like in these, my last moments, to join the names of God and Iberia, and for us all to embrace one another and to shout for the last time on the threshold of my death - Arriba Ibéria!""

 #National Union Events 
 IBR.633.t:0 "Channeling Minority Nationalism"
 IBR.633.d:0 "The minorities of Iberia are the nastiest of them all. With frightening dedication, the secessionists are the greatest threat the Union could ever face. At their worst they are able to create 'red zones', isolated pockets of extreme activity. While these red zones are essentially massive targets that are stomped out just as quickly as they appear, it serves as a great example of how unpleasant they can be. For the sake of stability these occurrences need to be reduced or even stopped.\n\nInitially, the plan was just to simply channel it towards foreigners. There was an issue with this, though, and it was that we didn't have any plan beyond 'point them at the outsiders'. So we put our best minds at the Axencia to it, and after laboring day and night they presented a more in-depth plan. All that remains is to put the plan into effect, and watch them flock to our banner."
 IBR.633.a:0 "What are we waiting for?"

 IBR.634.t:0 "Continuing The Integration"
 IBR.634.d:0 "We must integrate the minorities into Spanish society. It is the only way, or else we will be prey to eternal terrorism and destabilization from the more radical elements of their people. Minority cultures must die. The first step is to eliminate their language. Only Castilian will be taught in schools, and local media will never use local languages. Like Franco's policies, total immersion in the language coupled with allowing no further instruction of minority language will kill it off until everyone speaks Castilian or Portuguese. After that comes the second phase, where the differences between Castilian and the minority cultures will be slowly eroded until they are the same. Then, no matter what they say they are, they will be Spanish. There's an issue and it's obvious: this will cause a lot of anger. The policies aren't negotiable so it's necessary to find another way to quell most of the unrest.\n\nAnd a contingency plan is exactly what's planned. Should the minorities get too uppity then we'll arrange a meeting with several leaders of their community, and offer them some apparent 'guaranteed rights and privileges' in exchange for them publicly denouncing any separatist forces. What we'll fail to mention is that there is a loophole or an override for all of these, rendering them moot. By then, it'll be too late to object to them."
 IBR.634.a:0 "Who do you think will go first, the Galician or the Catalonian?"
 
 IBR.635.t:0 "Redefining Separatist Activities"
 IBR.635.d:0 "Too many terrorists slip 'under the radar' just because their crimes aren't legally considered crimes. It is on us to change that. Even there, though, there is still an issue. There's little consensus on just how wide the window of separatism truly is. The dispute got so bad that eventually De Valcàrcel had to step in and set the policy based on his own views on the matter. Coincidentally, his opinions happened to be the harshest of them all.\n\nUnder the new legal definition, separatism extends far beyond simple terrorism. Now, anyone found to be so much as sympathizing with separatists can be charged with the same crimes as the terrorists themselves! That is to say nothing of what now legally constitutes separatism. All that needs to be done is send the new laws to the Axencia Anti-Separatista and direct them to arrest those who had slipped through the cracks previously."
 IBR.635.a:0 "Make sure they have plenty of handcuffs too."

 IBR.636.t:0 "Making Use Of The Cults Of Personality"
 IBR.636.d:0 "The Caudillos were very careful to cultivate a strongly positive public image. In every minute they were revealing themselves to the people they put on an aura of authority and morality - it really looked like they were entirely ready for both their job and working with each other. The idea of two benevolent guardians was able to tame many into obedience, and not having to take action against as many people only served to reinforce the image of kindness, which in turn led to more obedience, and so on. Over time this image has fallen to the wayside because nobody was willing to use it. It's time that we place it back into Iberian society, as it should be.\n\nTo the populace we will portray ourselves as the successors to the Caudillos. We will claim the legacy of the benevolent protectors, and extract what loyalty we can out of that. After all, we are the new Caudillos, following in the steps of the previous ones; and if you followed the old ones why wouldn't you follow us too?"
 IBR.636.a:0 "We only want what's best for them."

 IBR.637.t:0 "The Principles Of Christian Civilization"
 IBR.637.d:0 "Later today we will begin publication of "The Principles Of Christian Civilization", a thesis declaring Iberia to be a society of moral Christians. The thesis will be particularly targeted at the clergy, who will be able to get the ideas out to more people better than we could. Within the thesis we will begin by elaborating on the definition of 'Western Civilization', and how it is founded on Christian values. Through this we can explain how Iberia, a western civilization, is also founded on these Christian values. From here we shall proclaim that the Union will fall into barbarity and chaos without these values. It will be elaborated on what they are: charity, chastity, and obedience for your highers. The three pillars, the fundamentals of any good moral society. It will be a call to all who read it to maintain and spread these values everywhere they go, and to become the paragons of Christianity by following them."
 IBR.637.a:0 "A little bit of religion never hurt anybody."

 IBR.638.t:0 "The Old Propaganda Tactics"
 IBR.638.d:0 "Back in the days of the Caudillos, they used total immersion in propaganda to more effectively persuade people. If there was no other view, then the only perspective would eventually beat you down into accepting it. There was only one issue to this, and it was that it took a very fine level to achieve the desired results. Too much, and you risked apathy. Too little, and you could let some unapproved material slip through the cracks. But not to worry, as the people who worked this before are still around now. Even better, most of them have come to work for us. All we need to do is let the experts run free, and before we know it we'll have the people twisted around our fingers. After all, if anyone can replicate the success of the past, it would have to be the people who enabled it. They will be provided all they need, and a bit more, to make sure any dissidents are relegated to the fringe."
 IBR.638.a:0 "Whatever it takes, so long as it gets results."

 IBR.639.t:0 "Instigating National Fervor"
 IBR.639.d:0 "Propaganda is only one thing, and if it's all you use you'll never get anywhere in your doings. For maximum efficiency there needs to be a drop of truth, or even better a gallon of hatred. In order to really coax an Iberian identity it is necessary that one of the two are utilized. In this case, it would be better to pour on the hate. Then, it can be capitalized on. Find a scapegoat, give them plenty of blame, or make someone look scary, then talk about how you need the military to keep things in order. Emphasize the armed forces, ensure people know how necessary they are. Regardless, with the emphasis on things you can blame, you can more effectively rally people around opposing said thing.\n\nIt is still trivial to assign some incident from a foreign power as an act of malice. Then, once it is established there is a threat, the nation can be whipped up into a frenzy. By using some limited hyperbole to get the desired effect, hate can be channeled away from the state. Because all of their discontent is aimed at someone else they will be far more willing to listen to their betters. While it is unsavory these tactics are necessary to make sure people properly respect authority. The success of this program is already a given, so everything that needs to be done is to set it into motion."
 IBR.639.a:0 "Someone else is the issue, not us."

 IBR.640.t:0 "Striking Against Leftist Influence"
 IBR.640.d:0 "Socialism has been an eternal cancer ever since the day its vile ideas were conceived. They are a dangerous set of principles that fill people with naive beliefs of what is simply impossible in practice. Even worse, they allow for fools and despots to navigate their power, enslaving everyone who dared help them. For their sake, we must stop this ideology where we can. From here on out, all hives of this dangerous thought will be rooted out and removed from Iberia. More importantly, we will be able to rally the populace in opposition to leftism.\n\nWhat is remarkable about the destruction of socialism in Iberia is that it is one of the few things the upper echelons of the party are in total consensus on. They all want it gone, entirely, as soon as possible. The entirety of the Unión Nacional was united in one goal:"
 IBR.640.a:0 "Iberia must never be red, ever."

 IBR.641.t:0 "Investigating The Left Opposition"
 IBR.641.d:0 "Once the discussion turned from the question of elimination socialism to where to start, any semblance of party unity disintegrated. Thankfully this time the situation resolved itself quickly enough to ensure de Valcárcel did not intervene. The first most important step to removing leftism is to destroy their influence in politics. But how? They clearly must be arrested for their harmful beliefs, but there is no valid cause that they may be arrested for. At least, that we know of. That we might not know about some of their doings - of which could be grounds for arrest - was enough to pique the attention of several party members. The next move was already a certainty. The opposition would be investigated, their socialist and separatist ties revealed, and their members arrested. While the circumstances to enable such a move are contrived and tenuous at best, they are necessary to keep Iberia safe. "
 IBR.641.a:0 "The ends justify the means."
 
 IBR.642.t:0 "The Organic State"
 IBR.642.d:0 "Anyone with a brain knows that more things than humans are living beings. For example, the country itself is a living being too. Much like an organism, the state is comprised of many lesser parts who, all together, create something far greater than each other separate. Nowhere is this more true than Iberia, where several regions come together to form a greater whole. Much like an organism, however, there cannot be room for deviation. All parts must perform their dedicated function, and allowing anything to stray from their role will hamper the function of the whole. This school of thought is one that needs to be applied to all levels of government, and until it is accepted by the people it must be hammered into their heads that they ought to hush up about their grievances, and allow the dedicated leadership organ to do their job, just as they ought to do theirs."
 IBR.642.a:0 "No one can stand if their arm is fighting their leg."
 
 IBR.643.t:0 "Enforcing Catholic Social Doctrine"
 IBR.643.d:0 "A truly moral society is one based on her religion. In order to have a strong union we must lean on our traditions, and the faith is the strongest of all traditions. Therefore, Catholicism should be raised up, and injected into Iberian society. Thankfully there is a pre-established doctrine for placing religion as a main pillar of daily life. The value of the common good above all else is paramount. If one focuses on the individual, then they will neglect the whole to the detriment of the common good.\n\nOf course we lack the support to properly put this into effect. In order to move things along we will need to rely on support outside of our party. Due to their ideological proximity we will discuss the matter with some of the more malleable members of the Alianza Popular. In order to secure the success of the Catholic social doctrine the party must be convinced. Without their support, it will not be possible to achieve our goals."
 IBR.643.a:0 "So you'd best be persuasive."
 
 IBR.644.t:0 "Discussing Corporatist Economics"
 IBR.644.d:0 "No-one could ever deny that morality and piety are critical to the national health of Iberia. However, simply posing these as the end-all be-all of the nation's well being could not be farther from the truth. Any state is tied to their economy, and the prosperity of one spurs the prosperity of the other.\n\nAt least, that is how it should be. Unfortunately, 'should' is frequently replaced with something else. A privatized economy is a good example of something that is anything other than 'should'. Iberia has the right to her own destiny and self-determination. With the corporations of foreign people in charge of her economy, the Union lacks that self-determination, since it cannot exercise sovereignty over every bit they ought to. Therefore, a new system needs to be put in place. Every segment of the economy will be placed under the control of a corporate block, who will then operate it for the common good.\n\nThis matter is undoubtedly unpopular, despite its benefit. Without the support of the Alianza Popular, the corporatist system has no chance of success. Therefore discussions will be held in order to convince the other party that this system will be something worth supporting. Their success is critical."
 IBR.644.a:0 "I'm getting really tired of having to ask others to get anything done."
 
 IBR.645.t:0 "The New History Curriculum"
 IBR.645.d:0 "Iberian history isn't correctly written. Between outright Socialist lies and slightly less harmful half-truths it is easier to say what isn't false. Since our power is secure it is our solemn duty to change that.\n\nThe people of Iberia are held back by the deceptions and so they must be changed. The first truth is that the Caudillos weren't the best for either Spain or Portugal. Everyone knows that, but it is more nuanced than that. Like it or not they were stabilizing figures, and this fact needs to be represented in history. Equally so is the depiction of the empires that preceded Iberia. They aren't given a fair chance, and their qualities - such as their abilities to civilize and bring holiness to savages - are sorely missed.\n\nWhile only a sample of the sweeping reforms that are necessary to properly show the Union's history, it needs to be mentioned how monumental this project is. Once the new curriculum is fully written, it will be printed into new textbooks, and sent off to every school free of charge. After that it is only a matter of time."
 IBR.645.a:0 "There is something truly beautiful in seeing the world for how it really is."
 
 IBR.646.t:0 "Targeting The Fundamental Laws" 
 IBR.646.d:0 "De Valcàrcel sat secluded in his study. The sun had long since set and the night had gone on so long that it was closer to sunrise than sunset. It was at this late hour that the party leader contemplated. Sleep had nearly consumed him, but he would not let it until he knew what he was going to do.\n\nLate at night was hardly an apt time to consider matters of state, but there was simply no time to do it elsewhere. There was one thing on the man's mind: their political career. No matter what they did, where they did, it was always blocked by the opposition! Even when they weren't doing it the Alianza Popular made sure to stick their noses in too. Nothing got done, and nothing could be done! A rage was boiling up from the party leader's depths, but he bit it down.\n\nPiecing together a solution only took a few minutes. If the opposition always got in the way... then they'd need to be shoved out of the way, or better yet ran over. As a draft was drawn up and plans were born, Valcàrcel's expression went from anger, to smugness, to excitement.\n\nThe scribble of pencil continued all through the night. When the Francoist finally woke up again he found a - barely legible - set of documents and a burned out lamp bulb."
 IBR.646.a:0 "Acceptable. At least now we have the means to make sure we're properly heard."

If anything, they seem to be even angrier. The intent was to decrease terrorist support among minorities, but the opposite has occurred.

Those that haven't have nearly unanimously put in a formal complaint: our new definitions are horrid, and the Axencia cannot operate using them. The arguments from this have varied from their draconic nature to the inability to feasibly execute them. What they have not seemed to consider is that, by the new laws, this is also separatism. The response is obvious. All protestors of the new programs will be arrested and replaced with people more dedicated to their jobs. Sadly, this will render the Axencia nearly inactive until it is properly reorganized. "

 IBR.651.d:0 "We have gone overboard with the crackdown. Our agents displayed an unusual zealotry in enforcing the new anti-separatist regulations, and have arrested an obscene number of suspects from all around the peninsula. By itself this is no negative - it is a strong positive, as these are people who can no longer threaten Iberia - but there is more to complicate the situation. So many people have been arrested in such a short amount of time that we cannot keep up with it. There is an overwhelming number of prisoners to process, trials to be held, and legal challenges to bat down. All these issues will be sorted, and the initial wave of arrests will eventually die down, but it will take time. Valuable time in which the Axencia will effectively be at a standstill until the holding facilities have enough space to house arrests again."

 IBR.652.d:0 "For a while, the new separatist definitions worked. Our men were dedicated, and the prisoner flow was not so much as to overwhelm our processes. As time went on, it appeared as if it had gone as expected. Sadly, it didn't. Once more suspects were arrested we moved higher up, going from random people to more important figures who now lacked a support base to back them. The convicted separatists were able to cause quite a stir among the public, who now organize campaigns of disobedience against us in retaliation. While only a matter of time until the incidents fade from the public eye and these protests become bad memories, until they are forgotten the Axencia will be operating on a handicap. It is far harder to find separatists among a populace who wishes to spite the authorities. "

 IBR.653.d:0 "One moment, the man was delivering a speech to the assembled crowd of citizens from Bilbao. The next, he was dead on the ground, with a hole through his chest. A gunshot was audible, but the shooter was nowhere to be seen. Even though the former bodyguards of the deputy and later the Guardia Civil began a sweep for the killer, he could not be found.\n\nEven though it has only been an exceptionally rare occurrence, the recent murder of a deputy of the Unión Nacional has sparked a new wave of fear in the party. Many members are afraid that they would be next in a chain of assassinations, and the attitude has had a negative impact on productivity. Instead of doing their job, some members are more concerned with obsessively securing themselves in the event of an attempted killing. The fear will eventually dissipate into nothing, given time and assuming no other murders take place. It has already done its damage, and the shortfall of work done has temporarily paralyzed Iberia, as the time wasted was needed to make sure the absence of several deputies would not be a negative effect."

After the last object falls into the greedy embrace of the fire the bunch stop a moment more to admire their handywork, then flee off into the darkness of the country.\n\nIncidents of this sort - symbolic destruction of anything in Spanish - have grown more popular since the continuation of the integration efforts. Given recent circumstances, they seem certain to only get more commonplace. Leaders of minority communities have all squarely refused to negotiate, taking stances that vary from neutrality to outright support of what they consider 'just' resistance against Iberia. Given the substantial influence these figures hold within their communities, combined with the integration policies, supporting separatists is far easier to swallow for most.

Coaxing them into a negotiation to bring it all to an end was a simple matter. The verbal back-and-forth, plotted out by the National Union, ended with the intended response: the participating minority leaders condemned the actions of their separatists, and in return rights and privileges were guaranteed by the government. By the time they had realized these wouldn't mean anything, the damage had been done.

Their intended message was simple and because of that it was simple to work it into something else.\n\nEven through all of this the Principles simply weren't enough. They simply lacked the longevity to stick with those receptive to the idea, a group outnumbered by the group that wasn't. A lasting impression only developed among only a small few.

In a public statement a clique of key Alianza Popular figures condemned the ideas contained within the Principles, decrying them as a 'lamentable perversion of religion' and even outright calling it 'francoist in nature'. While this proclamation had little effect on those already not in favor of the mandate, to those who thought something of it this was a very effective turnoff. At the urging of the Alianza Popular the more religiously minded of Iberia found themselves a bit less trusting of their ruling government, as a state that was so willing to pervert the meaning of the faith was not their state at all."

 IBR.659.d:0 "It is a chilly morning in Lisbon. But the inclement weather didn't seem to stop a crowd from turning up. Gathered in front of a government building, a cluster of individuals especially stood blocking the way into the building. When an official or a clerk tried to make their way inside someone moved over to stop them. This continued for what felt like an eternity as morning turned to day and only got warmer. Finally, the police arrived. Though some appeared sluggish and reluctant the law enforcement agents did their duty and dispersed the crowds. While functions were able to continue on after that, the damage had been done. Half the day had been wasted by protestors, and function was crippled for a substantial time after.\n\nThis was not the only city this occurred in. Every major city (and some minor too) in the Union had a similar rally, as protestors blocked off government functions as best they could for as long as they could. The emphasis on military and it's necessity caused a large amount of discontent, and so the average citizen was just a little bit less trusting of their government."

 IBR.660.d:0 "Over the course of our crusade to root out bolshevism, dissent has spread to every area of government. Everywhere that we do not directly control has been victim to some sort of agitation or discontent from more foolish souls.

This sentiment has gradually diffused into the general populace, sparking dissent and outrage everywhere it goes. Sadly it appears an uproar has already been whipped up and so citizens have began a series of rallies and protests against the investigation into the political left-wing.\n\nThe mass of objectors have one demand: the immediate cessation of the investigation. As there are a large amount of people who have made their opposition vocal folding to their demands is an entirely possible option. Of course, it is also possible to simply send in the Guardia Civil to force them to disperse. The action will not be popular but against law enforcement agents they will be forced to comply."

Crackdowns and forced dispersals have only made the affair less popular with the population. Even worse, it has given a more convincing excuse to call the investigation off. The argument espoused by leftist mouthpieces is that, since it causes enough to force a police presence, it clearly isn't that democratic. The crowd who wishes to oppose us no matter what we do has latched on to this and parroted it to no end.\n\nSince any protest against the action is shut down by the Guardia Civil not long after it begins, we can simply keep on as planned. Public outrage is nothing new, and it will subside with time. Alternatively it would be simple to just call the investigation off. A move like that could save face among elements of the public and would in effect be cutting our losses."

Not even the tiniest violation - they had run an exemplary campaign.\n\nIt wouldn't do. The public reaction - all that for nothing - would be horrible. In these moments of unfiltered desperation, a plan was concocted; if there was nothing to be found, then something would need to be 'found'. This idea was very popular among the party, but simply calling it a day never fell out of favor.

As time went on a questionable response caused things to only get worse. The Barcelona Incident, as it was later called, was really set in motion by a perfectly positioned car bomb. When the situation escalated the Guardia Civil were caught even more by surprise and were nearly entirely forced out of Barcelona by rioting citizens. What was most devastating about the whole affair, however, was that the law enforcement was humiliated. Unable to entirely contain the situation in a timely manner, they instead were forced to cordon the affected areas off and choke off the riot.\n\nIt appears this wave of unrest stemmed from the accusations levied towards the more left-wing politicians, which were flawed and easily debunked. The idea of evidence being faked in such a fashion seemed only to enrage the population, laying the groundwork for today's tragedy. "

Worse, it was considered by most to be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nOutside of the frontlines, incidents had occurred that could almost be considered optimal. The Axencia discovered a group of Catalonian terrorists planning to incite violence by detonating a bomb during the rally in Barcelona. Thanks to some 'convenient' and legitimate appearing documents, the attempting bombing was able to be tied to the more leftist areas of Iberian politics.

Another small segment of the populace took active hostility against the doctrine. Seeing a 'malicious pattern' in what it attempted to convey led to them opposing it everywhere they found it. To both extremes it was a matter of harsh contention, but the majority didn't think anything of it either way.

Unfortunately, without their full support the doctrine is dead. Even though it would likely be possible to compromise on a neutered version of the proposal doing so would render it pointless. Though it is true that there are some, namely the loyalists, would vote in favor of the measure anyway, they are insignificant.

The prevailing concern among the AP was the 'Francoist' nature of the proposal, but this seemed to not play large enough of a part to significantly influence the outcome.\n\nThe importance of this support cannot be understated. This initial support sets the foundation for a trend that can be capitalized upon later on. Additionally, this means that we are able to move through, unrestricted, with the Catholic social doctrine. Nothing will be left out, and everything will be just as hoped. More advantageous than even the trend of support set by this move is the influence it grants us within the Alianza Popular.

Once the far-reaching nature of our policies became obvious, the tone of negotiations changed drastically. From one of those present, 'the whole place dropped a few degrees. Nearly anyone who got what we meant gave us some kind of look.'\n\nWithout these discussions any chances of securing Alianza Popular support for the policy are gone.

If we do not, then the deal is off.\n\nThe prospect of planning an entire system in the space of twenty-four hours proved too much for our economists. Their relief was palpable when it was revealed that much of it was already planned. The ideals were there, and only the minutiae between them needed to be plotted out.

Rapidly rallying their supporters in Madrid, the opposition have used their useful idiots for two purposes. Firstly, they have harassed Unión Nacional members. Even worse is their second use, in which they have been used as leverage to reverse the measures before they go into full swing.\n\nFrom their advantageous position the protestors are capable of placing an immense pressure on the government, which could easily be assuaged by calling the policies off. The side effect of this would be that this would embolden the opposition, which could threaten to deadlock the already fragile system.

This pain came in the form of a downturn economically. Because of the obsession with constant growth this came at great detriment to our popularity, both internally and externally. We have fallen under attack from short-sighted figures from every end of the political spectrum, and the whole affair has been very unpleasant.\n\nEverything we could do to save our situation was to rapidly roll back the corporatist system. This has not saved much, but it left a salvageable sum we would lack from doubling down. It has inspired a wave of militants and reprobates to begin vocal opposition to our party.

Despite the Alianza Popular's willingness to go along or at least compromise on most matters, they no longer wish to associate themselves with us on economic matters. It will not be an issue in the short term, but once the economy requires further calibration we will find ourselves in unfortunate circumstances.\n\nEven though the Alianza Popular's disappointment was wounding, worst of all was the rifts created within the Unión Nacional.

It worked, as some of the most common reactions involve calling it 'extremely contrived' and equating it to historical revisionism.

In their place were a number of 'decoy' documents, which only held up to a quick glance's inspection.\n\nA scandal this size has never been seen before, and getting away from it before consequences come crashing down is probably impossible. Attempts to deflect or divert the public anger have failed. Rather than be mad at the criminals who leaked it, they have instead opted to be angry at the people being leaked.

In these reached people it found more supporters, and so on. The whole thing had nearly irreversibly spiraled out of control by the time it made its way to Valcàrcel's attention.

Francoism was a mistake, and they deceived the Alianza Popular into supporting it. Because of this, the two parties would never associate again. Instead of just staying alone, they would instead work with a separate organization to bring the Unión Nacional their day of reckoning.\n\nWhile most of this was to be expected given the circumstances, the final statement worried Valcàrcel.

These suspicions proved themselves right when that same opposition made their move. Beginning by divulging that every exit was blocked, the so-proclaimed 'Democratic Salvation Coalition' and their spokesman - Fraga himself - began speaking to their captive audience.\n\nTheir message, while delivered in so, so many more words, was simple: The Unión Nacional's authoritarian tendencies were unacceptable, francoist, and would drag the entire Union into the dark days they never should be taken back to. Therefore, for the good of the nation, the Unión Nacional could not remain in power any longer. The whole party would stay in the building until they jointly announced their resignations.

All it would take is the attention to be focused somewhere else. So de Valcàrcel tapped the shoulder of another party member - a dedicated, trustworthy hardliner - and gave him some simple instructions. Cause a fuss, make a scene, just draw all the attention to you.\n\nAs the man made a fool of himself to a watching audience, de Valcàrcel crept out of the room and through the hallways. Keeping hidden as to make sure nobody saw him sneaking around, he looked through room and room, searching for a very particular object. He would call the Guardia Civil, and have them arrest the opposition! The only issue was to find a phone that also wasn't monitored. Finally, as he found himself near an office room, he saw exactly what he was looking for."
 IBR.680.a:0 "A phone! Salvation! Let's see how those bastards like the feel of truncheon."
 
 IBR.681.t:0 "Unión Nacional Stands Down"
 IBR.681.d:0 "As de Valcàrcel looked around, he contemplated the futility of his situation. There was no way he could slip out of the Chamber. There was no way anyone else could, either. Even then, he spent a few awkward minutes trying to puzzle his way out of the room. Once he was fully confident he couldn't - a process of elimination that was increasingly painful the longer it went on - he simply couldn't find it in him to keep going. His gaze locked to the floor, shoulders slumped, he walked forward and grabbed a resignation form, and sloppily signed his signature.\n\nWith his position forfeit and his presence no longer justified, de Valcàrcel shuffled his way out of the Chamber. The guards stepped aside to let him through. After the departure of their leader, the Unión Nacional's members slowly filtered out too, and after a while the party was no more."
 IBR.681.a:0 "You know, I expected far worse."
 
 IBR.682.t:0 "Democratic Salvation Coalition Takes Control"
 IBR.682.d:0 "Now that the Unión Nacional has been decapitated, we find ourselves dominant in the Congress. Without their leadership they are relegated to that of a writhing snake, waiting for someone to put them out of their misery. That someone needs to be us. However, a large number of obstacles remain in our way to save the Union.\n\nTheir first failsafe is in the bureaucracy. The Unión Nacional has sunk their talons deep, and a large amount of administrators still have loyalty - or sympathies - for the Francoists. These unknown loyalties could prove detrimental, and if they aren't eliminated it could stop any meaningful reform.\n\nIt is undeniable that the UN managed to take a near-frightening grasp on the population, especially in the conservative sectors. This same grip allowed them to do a large amount of damage to Iberian society, with harmful religious propaganda, inflamed minority tensions, and nearly assert their control for a "New State".\n\nEven though their influence and reach were nearly all-encompassing, their more authoritarian policies provide a good framework to tear down the last resurgence of Franco's loyalists. Regardless of even that they still have many loyalists and sympathizers in the lower levels of the Union, and the minority groups are still enraged. All of these challenges together seem insurmountable, which begs the question:"
 IBR.682.a:0 "Could democracy be saved?"
 
 IBR.683.t:0 "Contacting The Guardia Civil"
 IBR.683.d:0 "When de Valcàrcel made a run for the nearest office, he knew his largest threat would be some Coalition goon wrestling him out and away from the phone. Once he was in the room, he pulled a chair to the door and blocked it. Then, he put another chair with it too. As the door was now adequately blocked for his standards, he tread over to the telephone, placing in the three numbers for emergency services. A one... another one... and a two.\n\n"How can we help?"\n\n"This is de Valcàrcel, they've taken the whole house hostage!" He glances outside - nobody has come yet. Then he glances back to the receiver. The voice on the other side was taking too long to answer. Could something be wr-\n\n"Don't worry, señor Valcàrcel. We're sending people right now. Can you wait for a few minutes?""
 IBR.683.a:0 ""Why yes, yes, I think I can.""
 
 IBR.684.t:0 "Guardia Civil Enter The House Of Deputies" 
 IBR.684.d:0 "As it turns out, the Guardia Civil only needed four minutes. Because the office de Valcàrcel had hid in was near an entrance, he didn't have to wait much longer than four minutes for his salvation. Creating a commotion as he threw his makeshift barricade to the ground and rushed through the door to the authorities. He proclaimed to them to follow him, as he would personally oversee the arrests of the traitors. The walk was short, and any Coalition member he came across moved out of the way of his army, though they weren't being arrested - likely being left for later.\n\nTriumphantly, he marched into the Chamber of Deputies with his entourage close behind him. After allowing his party a moment or two of jeering, he began to speak to the opposition. There would be no resignation, only arrests. All traitors to Iberia and the Union will be arrested, and then the country would finally be free. "
 IBR.684.a:0 "Check."
 
 IBR.685.t:0 "Guardia Civil Expels National Union, Arrests Leaders"
 IBR.685.d:0 "On and on continued de Valcàrcel, ranting and raving about anything that crossed his mind, made him mad, and could vaguely be tied to the Alianza Popular. He was fully engrossed in his speech. As such, he failed to notice the Guardia Civil moving near the Unión Nacional members, slowly surrounding them. It was only when a party leader pushed back against an officer and was wrestled to the floor. The noise of the fight was enough to knock de Valcàrcel out of his trance, and as he turned to look he was handcuffed.\n\nMeagre protest was all the man could raise, and the knowledge that everything he did was going to be undone collapsed on him. Most didn't see much, but a younger man saw the leader of the Unión Nacional in tears as he walked by - a sight more pitiful than anything. The rest of the Unión Nacional was escorted out shortly behind him. Awkwardly shuffling towards the near exit, most left with either silence or quiet muttering."
 IBR.685.a:0 "...And mate."

 IBR.5412.d:0 "Unfortunately, we can't rule alone. If we could, the country would be back under a rightful eye and a strong director. Our coalition partner, the Alianza Popular, is still an independent party, and so we need to keep them happy, for the most part. Usually, the most it takes is a concession on some policy or another. With the recent crisis unfolding, we can compromise on plenty of things to get them to keep their heads down.\n\nThe recent drop in oil has made it necessary for non-essential workers to stay home, for conservation. They simply burn too much oil in transit, as well as with running the actual places of work. We can't stop many private workers, but several state professions have been called to stay home to preserve fuel. The Alianza, ever the fiscal hawks, have lobbied for the salaries of these public workers to be frozen, or reduced in proportion to the hours they currently work. We have to do something at the minimum, but if we go as far as the Alianza Popular desires then we may lose support from the people whose salaries have suddenly disappeared. Of course, this may give us a perfect opportunity to extend our influence over them..."
 IBR.5412.a:0 "Freeze their salaries outright"

 IBR.5413.t:0 "Collecting Additional Revenue"
 IBR.5413.d:0 "Oil use needs to be curbed. It has to be curbed, in fact, if Iberia wants to keep functioning. We need to make sure our use of the black gold is less than the scant amounts we can acquire, until the shortage is concluded.\n\nThe current proposal is a raised consumption tax, effectively discouraging oil use by taxing people extra for using it. This plan has attracted remarkable support, both from our coalition and from the other parties. Using this once-in-a-lifetime bipartisan support, the law itself is a certainty. The only question is how to best apply the tax.\n\nBack when Franco was in charge, the government didn't need to concern itself with popular support. They simply did what was best, without boiling it down to sate the masses. Franco is no longer here, and his government gone, and to ever bring it back we will need the support of the people. The law would undoubtedly work better if we applied it universally, but if we were to spare the common worker from it, then we would definitely gain their support. Either will work, it is just a question of which is best."

 IBR.5414.t:0 "A Counteroffer"
 IBR.5414.d:0 "The debtor organizations which sought to undermine our government were very malleable, once we acted against them. They thought themselves very clever, with their extortion and their ability to hide horrible deals just under the surface. The creditors have greatly reduced their demands after we threatened to destroy them with full force. It isn't a bad thing by any means, but there is the possibility of gaining more.\n\nThe government is definitely not the only group these bastards have scammed, and if we do nothing we will be far from the last. We could definitely make use of these services more than once - though what would bring us there is unknowable - if we kept them going. If we were to try them for their usury and make a great show of it, then it would undoubtedly be a great victory in the eyes of the common man."

 IBR.5415.d:0 "Valcarcel faced the crowd. Tens of people, clustered together in a small hall, and countless others watching him through the cameras facing him. Of course, they were not watching him yet- he still had some brief time before he was live. He was worried, for a moment, but the politician crushed his doubt like a separatist. He was Franco's successor, damnit, and he would need to speak like it too. Allowing doubt to fester would be a betrayal of Iberia.\n\nOnce he was live, he began to speak. Emphasizing with grand, sweeping movements of his hands, Valcarcel spoke of the need for unity, above all else.\n\nOr at least, he would have if he had not knocked down his water bottle. He had totally stopped, staring at the water bottle- for far too long - before picking it up in spite of the puddle it had made, and then recomposed himself.\n\n"This must not destroy our Union, Iberians! We are one country, united by our common heritage, and we must act like it! This is your struggle, and it is the struggle of the National Union, and it is the struggle of Iberia! We..." He trailed off, having forgotten the rest of his sentence. "...We will struggle together! Iberia will be united in prosperity, but first it must struggle united through hardship!"\n\nOnce all was said and done, Valcarcel found that it could have gone far worse. His voice cracked, but at least it was only once."

His Eminency spoke about the importance of faith and union in these troubled times, as the Caudillos are getting older and the power in the Union is being transferred from their hands into the Council's, the Archbishop has made use of a metaphor comparing the essence of the Nation with the development of life. At his start the child as well as the Nation must be brought up with a strong hand so he learns obedience and doesn't deviate from the right path, as the child matures the father should start to be more lenient with his offspring and allow him to relish his independence and find his place in the world, if these steps are followed thoroughly the child will make her father proud even after his death.

 IBR.750.d:0 "The flash of a dozen camera's went off as Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete emerged into the conference room and took the podium. If the newly appointed head of the Guardia Civil was nervous, few could tell. Back straight, his face a visage of determined calm, he was a military man through and through. All knew his record: A former Falangist and veteran of the notorious Division Azul which fought for Nazi Germany, he had now chosen to side with Iberian democracy and the Democratic Salvation Coalition.\n\n"Good morning," he began, greeting the assembled journalists. "I am here today in my capacity as Director General of the Guardia Civil to announce that by direction from the Minister of the Interior, the Guardia Civil, alongside the National Police Corps, the Municipal Police, and other regional law enforcement agencies, have begun a nation-wide inter-agency investigation into the involvement of federal agencies, government organizations, and state officials in the election of the Unión Nacional. It is the belief of the Guardia Civil, and the newly convened Democratic Salvation Coalition, that forces within the Iberian state manipulated the election result, ensuring a win for Unión Nacional in full knowledge of their plans to subvert the constitution."\n\nBefore he could even finish two dozen hands shot up while the room exploded into a cacophony of questions. Topete simply held his hand up, calling for silence.\n\n"Now, before I answer any questions, I wish to address those who may be listening who assisted in this plot. I say to you: Turn yourselves in. The Unión Nacional has been defeated. There is no further cause for undermining the Iberian constitution with the aim of restoring the Unión Nacional to its position of power. You will be found, caught, and punished.""

 IBR.751.t:0 "The Results Of The Investigation" 
 IBR.751.d:0 "Director General José Luis Aramburu Topete looked over the list one last time. There were many names he knew here, men who he had fought with during the civil war, even some he had fought alongside in Russia with the Division Azul. Such men would surely call him a turncoat, a traitor to the Falange, Caudillo Franco, and the Iberian nation. Aramburu didn't much care what they thought anymore. In his many years in the military he had always made choices based on what he felt was most in line with law, order, and security. During his youth that had meant siding with Franco against the terroristic insanity of communism. Now it meant siding with Iberian democracy against his former comrades and their fanatical authoritarianism.\n\nThe list was long, some 300 pages, containing the names of thousands of government employees, army officers, civil bureaucrats, and electoral officials, all party to the conspiracy to rig the elections in favor of the Unión Nacional. Hundreds of confessions had been correlated and compiled, leading to an ever growing number of exposed traitors. Most if not all would be charged with serious crimes, but that would have to wait. Now it was time to purge them all from their positions, and ensure they couldn't do any more damage.\n\nPlacing the list in his briefcase and getting up to head to the Ministry of the Interior, where he would present the Guardia Civil's findings to the new government, Aramburu could not shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The list was larger than even he had expected, and if the Unión Nacional had this much support inside the state, there was no telling how much they still had outside of it."

But now all we can guarantee is that the names that were listed will soon be serving prison terms for violating our new electoral system.\n\nIt is a shame that it has come to this, but we can at least show to the world that we will take our new democracy seriously."

But when the Guardia Civil went to seize the Unión Nacional records, all they were confronted with was many empty filing cabinets and piles of ashes in the party headquarters. All of the party's records from the last election have simply gone up in smoke.\n\nClearly, this was to hide their illegal activities of voter fraud, and to prevent the police and government from taking legal action. They have managed to hide their network of agents and saboteurs seeking to destroy our nascent democracy through fire and smoke. While we don't have any hard evidence, an officer of the Guardia Civil, speaking anonymously to the press, revealed our discovery. This has led to denunciations in the newspapers, and in turn the anger of the Iberian people. The UN is scrambling to respond to this incriminating act."

But when the Guardia Civil went to seize the Unión Nacional records, we were overwhelmed with the sheer amount of paperwork that the party had given to the police. Teams have been working around the clock to sort through the files and determine if something, anything illegal or incriminating has been discovered. So far, the answer is... very little. Maybe some of the entries in ledgers could be seen as possible evidence of voter fraud, but there is nothing solid or definite, and no 'smoking gun' that can unravel the whole mystery. What we have will help us, but it's not enough.\n\nThis is disconcerting, to say the least. Either the UN has managed to keep a massive voter fraud scheme virtually under wraps, or, much more concerning to our government, the UN has much more support than we realize. Neither scenario is promising for the Iberian Council."

Sitting in a bulletproof car across from the building, he radioed the order to begin the operation.\n\nThe building was stormed quickly, with no casualties. It seems that any of the Falangists who remained had chosen to surrender rather than make a last stand. Hearing that the coast was clear, Aramburu exited the vehicle, and headed through the front doors to the building. Entering the lobby, he found his men detaining several Falangists in military uniform, on their knees with their hands cuffed behind their backs.\n\n"Aramburu, you traitor," one of them spat, looking up at him. The Director General did not recognize him. Perhaps one of his former subordinates in the Civil Guard. "What is the meaning of this? This is private property. You have no right to be here."\n\n"I am here on orders of the Minister of the Interior and the Court of Auditors," he replied, ignoring the disdain of the prisoners. "You are to hand over all documents pertaining to the last election so that they may be submitted as part of the government's review of the election results. Where do you keep your files?"\n\n"Burn in hell," the Falangist scoffed, a look of disgust across his face. "You will get nothing out of us."\n\nAramburu sighed. He had hoped to avoid such unpleasantness.\n\n"Take them away," he said, turning to his men. "And scour the building. Their files should be here somewhere.""

We are certain that the UN has committed voter fraud and conspiracy against the state.\n\nThe trial will last many days, perhaps weeks, as prosecutors present their evidence, the defense tries to handwave it away or call out flaws in their opponents arguments. It will be prime television to a populace divided, with Nationalists believing that we are simply punishing the UN for having the audacity to contest elections, or that of the supporters of the Democratic Salvation Council are infuriated that their votes may have been stolen from them, and many, many more wait to make their final judgement.\n\nBut many already realize that old habits die hard, and the efforts by the Nationalists to rig the elections to turn out in their favor must be punished to the full extent of the law if democracy in Iberia is to mean anything."

But even more supporters of other parties are on the streets as well, believing that the elected government is on the verge of being overthrown in a coup, leading to clashes between the two groups on side streets throughout Madrid. Guardia Civil and police are doing their best to maintain control, but some looting, arson, violence, beatings and arrests are occurring as well.\n\nTo make matters worse for our government, Caudillos Franco and Caetano have sent a joint letter to the Democratic Salvation Council that we should resign our positions immediately, and to turn power over to "the rightfully elected government of the Iberian Union," meaning of course, the Unión Nacional.\n\nBut we know full well that the UN has committed voter fraud.

As more and more evidence is brought to light in the trial of the complex vote rigging scheme that the UN undertook, the masses are coming around to our side, and acknowledging that, well, maybe the UN did something wrong.

 IBR.761.d:0 "The Democratic Salvation Council has proclaimed a series of decrees to end the Corporatist domination of the economy of the past, and to bring Iberia closer in line with other democratic nations of the world. First and foremost, the big monopolies that had been set up will be disbanded, to establish competition in the economy, which will drive down prices and increase wages. The restrictions and bans on labor movements have been lifted, which will give the workers a say in how they are to be treated by their employers. We will also institute a minimum wage pegged to the yearly inflation rate, so that all workers have a chance to make a living.\n\nIt will take more laws and many more years of work to fully decorporatize the Iberian economy, but this is a first step."

 IBR.762.d:0 "The government has just passed a new education law which will provide a sweeping overhaul of the curriculum by sweeping away the dictatorship's propagandized elements of the system. First and foremost, the "national spirit formation" and "housework" subjects that many a young Iberian had grown to loathe over time will be ended entirely. In line with that, the portraits of the Caudillos will no longer be placed in every classroom, schools can now no longer raise the national flag at the beginning of the week and take it down at the end, college students are no longer required to sign an oath of allegiance to the state, the daily prayer and allegiance to the state have been removed.\n\nBut the biggest concern will be that of the subjects that are taught. While mathematics and science will be less affected, there are some that will need to be overhauled: for example, we will encourage more diversity in the reading materials in both Spanish and Protugese classes. History, however, is the biggest issue. The new law sets up a non-partisan board of historians and academics to rewrite the history textbooks, to provide a more equal and balanced subject for our students to learn at all levels of education. While we can still take pride in Iberia through the study of history, we must also recognize that we had done bad or terrible things in our past, and must acknowledge them."

Many new safeguards and mechanics have been put in place to ensure that our elections will be free, fair, and no longer tainted by authoritarians.\n\nThe new election law will make it very difficult to corrupt the vote, but also place enormous penalties on those that attempt to do so. While most of the law deals with the minor details to ensure that elections are fair, some of the most important aspects of the law is simple to understand: an impartial, non-partisan group will be in charge to provide the ballots, the ballot boxes, and set up polling places, as well as educating the public in how the elections work. The parties themselves will be banned from the polling places: no party posters, campaigners or materials will be allowed within 50 meters of any polling station. Guardia Civil officers will be present to oversee the voting at all times, to ensure that the ballot boxes are not tampered with, and at the end of the voting, three Guardia Civil Officers, chosen from outside the district that they are stationed in for this day, will take the ballot boxes to a secure location to be counted and verified.\n\nNow that a strong and enforceable election law is in place, the Democratic National Salvation Council has announced that they are resigning, dissolving the Iberian Council, and new elections will be held."

But unlike under the dictatorship, where the steely faced policemen were there to intimidate the voters to make the right choice, now they are there to scare away those that would try to tamper with the election, and to ensure that the voting is free and fair.\n\nMany other Guardia Civil officers are stationed across the Union to keep an eye on the rallies and parades, to ensure that no violence comes to pass. The head of the Guardia Civil gave explicit orders: no violence of any kind, by any party or group, is to be tolerated. If an agitator is trying to rile up the crowd, they are to be arrested. If a mob starts to form, they are to be broken up. If anyone tries to hamper anyone from voting, they will be charged with voter fraud and taken into custody. There will be no repeat of the last election.\n\nFor soon, millions will go to the polls, and will freely and fairly, choose the next leader of the Iberian Union."

The atmosphere upon entering the conference room was rather jovial, the room littered with small groups of dignitaries hunched in different corners in deep conversation, raucous laughter reaching even outside making the regular guests chuckle. Upon the last official entering and the stewards closing the door, the mood became more professional, the Americans quickly making the official OFN stance regarding the Iberians' request. An audible sigh of relief was heard from the Europeans as the discussion then shifted onto the minutia regarding the Iberians' rights and duties as a fully fledged OFN member. The US agreement has led to the possibility of a significant turning point in history as Iberia joins the alliance of free nations and further distances from fascist Europe."

In the most recent summit hosted in Iberia itself, more specifically the region of Cataluña, a fascinating subject was raised that our delegation had not considered before the meeting, as we had expected just discussions on military and diplomatic matters.\n\nLa Canadiense, one of our state run electricity providers that came into our hands during the great European economic slump of the 50s when Belgian and Canadian private investors panickingly sold their stocks and assets to us seemed to be considerable interest to the Iberians. Seemingly the Iberians planned to surprise us with their proposals to buy the assets, based in the region we were currently in, right at the end of rigorous discussions on other more pressing diplomatic matters as to take advantage of our desires to leave the sweltering conference room quickly. A decision has to be made now, with our good diplomatic ties we can trust the Iberians to make good use of the company's assets and could mean even closer relations, however we could also try to capitalize on the old assets and make more profit for our government."

Another piece of foreign owned capital in our nation is back in our capable hands, ready to be used for the good of the Iberian people, not the profit of the already rich Canadian government. We now have the means to further invest in the area and expand existing structures and machinery to make best use of the opportunity of harvesting more energy for our bustling and electricity hungry population. Using the company's existing knowledge in the field it could also help us to better understand hydroelectric power generation to better innovate in this field, which in turn may be useful for applying better use to the disastrous Gibraltar dam.

It was the notification that another Iberian delegation had arrived and been welcomed to do diplomacy with their eager US and OFN counterparts, however this time around they had brought very different instructions from Madrid and Lisbon, that caused a rather large stir in the conference. The piece of paper more importantly however stated in simple terms that the Iberians were ready to begin negotiations on officially entering the OFN as a key strategic ally in Europe. The decision that now has to be made, and it wasn't just his to make but other OFN members would follow suit, could be described as a key turning point in history.

Disappointed civil servants were in the process of abandoning the plans that had been made well in advance for the diplomats' arrival when an important notice was passed onto all ministries within the Iberian governmental structure. The Americans had sent an official letter, cordial in tone, declaring that due to vital strategic considerations when analyzing the European situation, Iberia was currently not able to be accepted in the OFN, a blow that struck hard considering the steadily improving relations between our nation and the democracies of the world. A major caveat was included in the letter however, Iberia would be allowed to join in a limited capacity as an OFN Observer. [ROOT.GetLeader] viewed the offer of the letter with more gratitude than many of his pessimistic ministers. The option to become an observer nation to the alliance would deepen ties across the Atlantic over time and perhaps lead to another chance for the Iberians. For now, he could only sigh deeply and put away the speech he was going to hold for the honored guests that would never arrive at a specially organized banquet that would never occur."

The currently still hidden motive these visits and the increase of cordial correspondence between the former despotic but German opposed federal union and us was clearly visible; the two combined peoples were likely wanting to draw closer to our alliance itself and from there join it as an equal member. A possibly very lucrative enterprise considering the strength of a Europe still shrouded in darkness and a protective far East. It however would not come without danger as the Germans have proven themselves in recent decades to not be very sensible folk, especially when reacting to foreign made stimuli. Our decision therefore is how to continue dealing with the Iberians, should we draw nearer quicker or only better relations slowly, betting on the Iberians not abandoning their current foreign policy towards us."

The positive news had opened entirely new pathways for his two peoples to find their position on the world stage amongst the competing world powers, finally there might be the option of directly being involved in the future of a ravaged Europe and the struggling globe in general. Not just being eternal watchers or low level influencers as a secondary power in a doomed anti-German alliance.

Instead of sending a diplomatic delegation of their own to visit our splendid homeland and continuing to foster better relations, the Americans have merely sent us a letter of appreciation. It contains a "warm" thanks for our efforts, but seems to contain little else for our analysts to go on. Seemingly the OFN still views having closer relations with our nation as a security hazard considering our close proximity to the slowly strengthening Fortress Europe. This was indeed factored into our predictions but still comes as an unwelcome turn of events. We however will not change our course of action, but instead tweak it to suit the careful Americans."

 #IBR.715.d:0 "During the euphoric German mania that seeped postwar Europe, one of the most damaging projects the National Socialists undertook was the building of the Gibraltar dam, a project doomed to fail with the foundations of the German economy being built on forgotten lies and empty promises. The consequences have been disastrous for the Mediterranean, the Union of Iberia included. It's economic growth and capacity shrunken by the failed construction project. With Iberia's democratization and diplomatic thawing, we have seen the former pseudo-fascistic bastardized nation align itself closer to our strengthening alliance of free nations. In one of the more recent diplomatic summits which included representatives from the European state, the issue of the dam and its incomplete nature were raised and discussed at great length. Considering our current foreign policy that favors closer ties to Iberia a considerable investment into the completion of construction could mean long term returns for us but also more importantly a more economically powerful dependent ally in a region of great strategic importance. However, there is always opportunity cost. The money could be used well in our own national economy and vocal, influential nationalists might consider the move unfounded and unnecessary causing political instability."

The economic possibilities that this project could have had for our nation are very considerable, the thorn stuck in our side could finally have been removed to unlock previously unimaginable possibilities for trade and electricity production. Therefore this is an extremely disappointing development considering our huge efforts to get closer to America and its allies despite the fearsome dangers it could bring for us from other European states less inclined towards the capitalist bloc. This betrayal will not be quickly forgotten both by our government and the Iberian people, who have found out via an unfortunate media leak. Since we cannot really retreat from our current foreign policy direction this has just reduced several key strides made so far. Hopefully our relations can improve relatively quickly so we can get back on track for solving other issues with the OFN."

 IBR.1001.d:0 "Long-built tensions in the Middle East have finally erupted, culminating in several emergent rebel groups and former colonies fighting either amongst each other or against their former overlord. With this wide-scale conflict however, comes a cost. The Middle East contains a vital resource hidden underneath its desert sands, oil. With access to this valuable material cut off, its general pricing has fluctuated significantly, causing widespread economic downturn among many countries in the process.\n\nUnfortunately, the [Root.GetName] was not spared from this, as a majority of its oil was imported from abroad. At the same time, as the situation escalates, nations with large stockpiles either refuse to sell any of their precious petroleum, or spike its price to extremely high values. Another disadvantage brought about by this oil shortage is the departure of several foreign businesses operating in Iberia alongside the mass frenzy of investors, panicking and selling their stocks before it's too late. This has led the [Root.GetName] to experience nationwide cycles of worker lay-offs, mass unemployment, and incurment of large amounts of debt. The government has announced plans to devote its remaining resources intensely in order to quickly solve the immediate problems, but the entire situation still remains uncertain."

[ROOT.GetIBR_Portuguese_Caudillo] delivered a short speech about how Iberia had done what seemed impossible, and beat Germany by finishing their own construction. Then, the tape was cut.

It was not particularly large, and was somewhat off to the side. It was only really visible if one looked for it, or was being shown it.\n\nSomeone out of view, after a signal from Franco, seemed to activate the statue - and it turns out that it was a fountain.

#Extraordinary Council Meeting Events

 IBR.4006.t:0 "Up With the Times" 
 IBR.4006.d:0 ""You've called me for a meeting, at this ungodly hour?" Salazar asked over the phone. It only took a glimpse out the window to tell the time, as the only thing illuminating the dark skies of either city were the street lights of Madrid and Lisbon. "What is so urgent to you that it cannot wait another... 10 or so hours?"\n\n"The scuffle at Barcelona has me worried." Franco sighed, wiping his forehead with a hand. "This is going to happen again. I know these rat bastard separatists better than you, and I know them well enough to tell you this won't be the end of it. Do you think we can survive another Barcelona? I don't, Antonio. We need to update the constitution, offer the people something that will calm things down for a while."\n\nFranco just kept speaking, only stopping to catch a breath. "But Antonio, we need to be a united front on this. We can't show disunity on this question."\n\n"Francisco, what are you on about?" Salazar asked. "Wasn't it enough that we created the Iberian Council? Now you want to give them more concessions?"\n\n"Tell me," Franco responded, his tone growing agitated. "Would you rather this Union fall apart? Do you want the consequences, if this peninsula melts around us? You know what would happen. We have to do something before it's too late. Help me out here, if only for your own sake.""
 IBR.4006.a:0 ""Damn you, Franco, I just want to go to sleep.""

 IBR.4007.t:0 "What Matters To the People" 
 IBR.4007.d:0 "Finally, the government was ready to discuss. It was not the entire government, of course - it was the Council, representatives from several government agencies, and the Caudillos themselves. Remarkably, the entire Council was present - which was the first issue the convention met. There were not enough seats for everyone. The convention solved its first issue in approximately three minutes with a couple of folding chairs.\n\nThe first real problem of the convention was where to start. They had a whole constitution to revise, after all, and even though they would reach all of it, they would not get it all done at once. Of course, this is where bickering ensued.\n\nFollowing an eternity of arguments over petty and ultimately meaningless issues, Salazar put his foot down and ordered them to start from the top: Basic needs."
 IBR.4007.a:0 "Let's get on with it."

 IBR.4008.t:0 "Maslow's Theories: Food" 
 IBR.4008.d:0 "A politician taps a finger on his notes, eventually settling and running his finger along the paper as he reads it aloud. "According to the psychologist Maslow, the, uh, his pyramid of needs posits a hierarchy of needs. Following its logic, the only way to get a happy, productive citizen is to make sure these needs are fulfilled." His voice is loud, but monotone. He clearly wants people to hear, though he doesn't seem very enthused himself. "As I'm sure you all know, everybody needs to eat. Hunger goes on, even when you can't stop it. I do not know anyone who cannot provide for themselves, but I am certain they exist. So, my partner would like to present..." He looks expectedly towards another politician, who starts speaking on cue.\n\n"I would like to propose something to help people get the food they need, so that they aren't left in the dust. A specially dedicated currency, to be given out to anyone in the country that needs it. They can spend this on whatever food they'd like- provided it is food and not luxury."\n\nThe hall lit up with speech, though eventually the Axencia representative spoke loud enough to be heard by all.\n\n"Why would we need this? You know about the Auxilio Social, right? It already does that duty for us! What's the point of bloating the state for a function we don't even need?"\n\nEventually, the Caudillos came to be the final word on the matter: Would there be a new food program, or not?"

No man here could deny that, without water, and I see some of you have bottles of it now, we would be as dead as, well, a graveyard."\n\nThe man continues. "As important as the water, is the cleanliness of that water. Drinking filth will do nothing but make you sick, at best. Without access to water, more than they strictly need, and clean, you cannot expect to have happy, productive citizens." The man clears his throat. "We need to make sure the water is clean. Some areas of Iberia have been left behind. They do not have clean water. I have some water regulations, here, and if we assert them then clean water will not be an issue."\n\nAnother councilman objected, his voice high but steady. "That seems very nice, but it's not necessary. Have you seen the news? We haven't had any cases of water poisoning, or of cholera, or of any other ailment that stems from bad water. We don't need to waste all our budget on measuring a pipe down to the first three drops through it. It'll be fine as it is."\n\nThe debate continued on, for much longer than the ones before it.

I have nothing to say about this, so I'll let a colleague take their position..." The man goes silent, as another speaks in a move that was painfully obviously coordinated.\n\n"It is critical that we make sure all Iberians have housing. Not everyone has a house, and some lack the means to gain one. Even worse, some do - but they live in squalor and filth. It is true that we provide housing already, but our programs are not sufficient. I would propose intervention into the housing market, with the specifics to be worked out later. It is our duty to make sure the people of Iberia do not want when we could provide."\n\n"But we can't provide, can we?" responded another councilman. "For all the comprehensive programs you and your bunch keep proposing, you never seem to stop and consider the budget. Well, we're going to consider the budget! The army needs funding, or we'll dissolve from separatism. The dam needs funding, or we'll dissolve from the second greatest flood to scourge the Earth. All of these minor issues will need funding, or we'll dissolve because all you can think about is how to spend every penny we don't have!"\n\nWith a sigh, Franco called both off.

 IBR.4012.t:0 "The Question of Colonial Citizenship" 
 IBR.4012.d:0 "A growing movement in the congress has finally found itself sufficient support to debate colonial citizenship.\n\nIberian citizenship is granted automatically to anyone who has a parent with Iberian citizenship - at face value, it is a simple policy. However, it becomes significantly more complicated once one factors in other processes, such as colonial residence. The natives are considered non-Iberian, and denied citizenship. Effectively, they are denied any of the benefits one would gain from citizenship.\n\nA clique in the congress has argued againt this policy, for several reasons. Some find it unjust to deny the natives citizenship, since they lived on the land before our settlers, and others oppose it for more practical reasons. They desire to create a "collaborator" group within the native populations with which to sabotage the others, or simply to ease administrative strain. The end result is the same: to give all African natives Iberian citizenship.\n\nTo say this argument experienced significant pushback is an understatement. Opposition has been fierce, with a great many wishing to maintain the status quo. The settler groups wish to keep the situation as it is, as the current laws work very favorably for the Iberian settlers. Ultimately, it is still the call of the Caudillos."

 IBR.4013.t:0 "Settler Associations Protest" 
 IBR.4013.d:0 "As predicted, the settlers took native citizenship very poorly. The groups, usually organized by colonial domain - such as Guinea, Morocco, and so on - have announced a joint proclamation, with a near-unanimous decision to publicly protest the federal government's decision.\n\nThey have declared our decision "unfair to the natural citizens of Iberia", with an emphasis on justice. Despite their claims otherwise, it is glaringly obvious that they are upset by the fact that natives will no longer be treated as second-class citizens, and the new legal parity has upset those who took their supremacy for granted. The word of the Caudillos is still supreme, and it seems about time that they be reminded of the finality of the government's decisions."
 IBR.4013.a:0 "You and them are equal."

 IBR.4014.t:0 "Natives Support the Government" 
 IBR.4014.d:0 "After the joint declaration, some settlers even took to protest in Casablanca, venting their anger against the government. It seemed as if the move would be a political expense and nothing more. To everyone's surprise, a group of natives showed up, counter protesting for the government. While the assembly did not come to blows, it came very close as law enforcement dispersed the protest.\n\nEven though this was a spontaneous action, it is representative of sentiments within native populations. We have been formally thanked by several native organizations - through the same channels as the settlers, in what seems to have been spite - for our decisions to extend citizenship."
 IBR.4014.a:0 "Thank you!"

 IBR.4015.t:0 "Native-Settlers Clashes Cause Deaths" 
 IBR.4015.d:0 "Tensions have reached an all-time high as Iberian mainlanders, furious with their lack of legal primacy, have resorted to less-than-legal methods of intimidating nearby colonials. Bands of retornados, armed with makeshift weapons, have started to hunt down and beat colonials they find vulnerable. This escalated when the natives started to fight back, creating what were quickly nicknamed "brigas repentinas", for their spontaneous and violent nature. As all incidents do, these fights began to escalate from two or three to as many as ten to fifteen on each side.\n\nIt has escalated again. After the murder of a retornado by a colonial native, riots have broken out in several major cities around the colonies.between both. The Guardia Civil is on standby, and the death toll is poised to only increase unless the riots are put down immediately."
 IBR.4015.a:0 "Intervene and disperse."
 
 IBR.4016.t:0 "Settlers Stand Down" 
 IBR.4016.d:0 "A crowd of men sit within a holding cell, in some distant prison they know nothing of. They get along quickly - they seem to have been soulmates, in a way. Their conversation eventually leads them to the great question: what were they in for? All present had the same reason, the "disruption of common decency", but they all knew they were in for protesting the new citizenship laws. They were eventually split up, incarcerated for their deeds.\n\nSights like this had become very common, at least for a small while. As the Guardia Civil intervened, they arrested a large number of rioting settlers. Following the show of force, most of those remaining surrendered. It seems like they won't be complaining about citizenship again."
 IBR.4016.a:0 "You better."

 IBR.4017.t:0 "The First African DNI" 
 IBR.4017.d:0 "King Hassan sat at his desk, looking over what seemed to be an endless number of documents. He signed his name on one, the black ink from his favorite pen shining brightly on the paper. Then, he looked to the next in the stack, another which seemed to be just a signature on the bottom. Regardless, it never paid to be unaware. He read the paper itself, expressing yet more legal provisions and regulations that, ultimately, just added up to common sense and basic decency. His silent musing was interrupted by the clicking of cameras, the flashes providing a harsh incentive to keep looking down. He supposed that nobody would be unsure of how the paperwork worked.\n\nThey found him again as he took the picture for his ID card, forcing him to keep the artificially widened smile on for even longer than he ever wanted. Better that than to frown for the cameras, he supposed.\n\nThe day came when the ID was ready to be received. Swamped by the press for what was undoubtedly an important day, he did his best pretend-to-want-to-be-here smile and held it up for everyone to see.\n\nSomeone asked him, "How does it feel to be the first native to get citizenship?". He knew what he had to say."

One word from any of the native leaders, and countless numbers would become insurgents and separatists, a wave harsh enough to batter down any of our previous attempts at colonial stability.\n\nSurprisingly, there was no such thing. At first there was nothing, but then one-by-one many of the leaders urged their followers to stand down. They wanted the bloodshed no more than us, it seems, and they have all agreed that citizenship is not worth the conflict. Our position is secure."

The council became one of the first external groups to see, in all its glory, the way in which the Caudillos cooperated. Everyone - except the two dictators - sat in silence, unable to muster the will to move or even stop watching the argument.\n\nThe clerk himself shrank back, unwilling to be near the source of the yelling.

It was enough to silence the Portuguese dictator, who sat shocked. After a few seconds, he lunged for Franco with a yell. The two had started to come to blows, wrestling with one another. A few slaps, a couple of punches, but the two were held back by their advanced age.\n\nYet again, the council was in stunned silence. The army representative suddenly stood up, almost dragging the Axencia agent out of his seat.\n\n"We need to stop them before they hurt themselves!" The officer turned the agent to the door. "Find a phone, call the Guardia Civil."\n\nAs the Axencia representative ran off, the military man turned to the rest of the council. He needed to lead them, too, it seemed.

 IBR.4024.d:0 "As the army officer moved to intercept the councilman, he was barreled out of the way by a second councilman, who was far more set on stopping his colleague than the officer. The two began fighting one another, presumably to figure out who would help their preferred Caudillo. It seems the spirit of pugilism was contagious, since most of the other council members had gotten into miniature brawls of their own.\n\nKnowing there was nothing he could do, the officer sighed and walked to the door. He figured that he could watch for the Guard and also keep an eye on the Caudillos. He hardly had to wait for the Guard, as several officers walked in a few moments after me made it near the door.\n\nThe situation was easily explained with a sweep of the hand - a good most of the council was fighting itself, and a handful were trying to pull people off of one another. It only took one person to stop the Caudillos from fighting, simply pushing the two old men apart, and the rest of the council took several minutes to stop. Most had the sense to stop once they saw the Guard arrive, however.\n\nThe Guardia Civil dispersed the meeting, and sent everyone away with mostly bruises and scrapes. If there was to be more discussion, it would be once the tensions had died down."

He didn't seem to be dead on closer inspection, merely unconscious, but those few moments allowed all hell to break loose.\n\nThe soldier beheld the true nature of the discussion, as the entire council dissolved into anarchy. Man fought man, and although nobody seemed to be using weapons, they sure did zealously swing their fists. Nothing he could do about any of them, his mind quickly thought, so he did the one thing he could.\n\nIt was very easy to break up the Caudillos, simply a matter of prying apart two old men. Then, he kept the two away from each other until the Guardia Civil arrived - a tense few minutes. The Guard did much more to break up the meeting than he could, seemingly absorbing the hostility of the rumble and using it against the council men.\n\nAfter an eternity of fighting, the final damages were tallied. A large number of members had been arrested for their brawling, and the Caudillos were sent to their homes to stew for a while, until the event was behind them. It was quite an unfortunate event, but perhaps it was better to have it settled now, rather than in an even more important event."
 IBR.4025.a:0 "It's over"

 IBR.4026.t:0 "The Justice Problem" 
 IBR.4026.d:0 "A councilman - a short fellow, with a bushy face - prepared his speech. Well, technically, it had been handed to him by Franco, but for all intents and purposes it was his.\n\n"It is a terrible issue with the modern Iberia that, for all its posturing as a unified country, it does not have a unified judiciary. The system is decentralized, and the regional courts can run around as if they are independent!" He quietly hoped that didn't seem too monotone. "Iberia can only fulfil its promise of unity when all elements of the country are united as if they were never separate. Our courts are no different. Are there any questions?"\n\nSomeone, to his dread, had a question. "How would we best integrate these courts? Centralization should only be attempted if we can ensure it does not go poorly. Therefore, I want to hear your ideas on the matter."\n\nOh no.\n\nIn an act of divine providence, someone was able to interject and answer the question, moving the pressure away from him. The debate was similar in nature, but the final consensus was that ultimately..."
 IBR.4026.a:0 "Decentralized justice is fine."
 IBR.4026.b:0 "We must centralize the justice apparatus."

 IBR.4027.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Caudillos" 
 IBR.4027.d:0 "The first, and most powerful, clique in Iberia was the leaders. The Caudillos guide the state, cooperating even when all pragmatic logic begs for backstabbing and treachery. They are capable, even as they age, and their guiding hands have saved the entire peninsula from collapsing into bloody anarchy.\n\nWhat in the world is there to fault them for?"
 IBR.4027.a:0 "Yes, everything is good."

 IBR.4028.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Military" 
 IBR.4028.d:0 "At the right hand of the Caudillos is their enforcement arm, the military. Franco and the military have had a very productive relationship dating back decades, and although Salazar is not as familiar to the soldiers and general, he has the sense to usually defer to Franco on such matters.\n\nThe military is very influential, and at no point allows the Caudillos to forget that they can remove them from power. To this end, no action against them is necessary. It would only create a conflict that the military has every chance of winning."
 IBR.4028.a:0 "They can make themselves irreplaceable, but not much else."

 IBR.4029.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Church" 
 IBR.4029.d:0 "Favoring the cross over the sword, similarly acquainted with the Caudillos is the Catholic Church. It is an incredibly influential institution, holding total dominance over Iberian religion. It permeates all facets of life in some way, the centerpiece of a stage carefully constructed to accommodate it by many rulers of Spain and Portugal. Because of its position, it is coincidentally a very important institution to keep loyal. The faith of many leads them to believe the Church, and if the Church is friendly to us, then so will the congregations follow. Some would argue that this is not a good thing.\n\nThere has been an argument that the influence of the Church - its monopolistic control over education, religion, and in many ways the thoughts of the faithful - is too great. The same groups arguing this propose that the Church's influence be checked, so that Iberia is not dependent on its loyalty. Of course, if they are not checked, then there is no reason to fret over their loyalty..."
 IBR.4029.a:0 "Take away some of its power."
 IBR_reformist_tt_26:0 "Limiting the influence of the Church will §Ymake reformism stronger in the Council.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_16:0 "Reducing the influence of the Church will §Yincrease the Council's influence.§!"
 IBR.4029.b:0 "It remains untouched."
 IBR_reformist_tt_27:0 "Letting the Church maintain all its power will §Yweaken reformism in the Council.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_17:0 "Not limiting the Church's influence will §Ydecrease the Council's influence.§!"

 IBR.4030.t:0 "Families of the Regime: The Party" 
 IBR.4030.d:0 "A state, unfortunately, cannot be run by only two people. They must delegate, and give up shreds of their power to lesser men so that the matter of government is not totally overwhelming. This is the plight of the Caudillos - in their age they have had to find other men to run matters that they can no longer perform. This is the foundation of the Unión Nacional, the party which runs what the Caudillos cannot.\n\nDespite formally being one group, anyone with any knowledge of it knows that there is far more than one group within the party. Reformists, technocrats, and hardliners are just a few of the groups who are perpetually struggling with one another for the favor of the Caudillos. This factionalism is agitating, as it hurts unity and harms Iberia as a whole through constant scheming. However, it also stops any of the groups from growing dominant and imposing their views on the state. Is the status quo preferable?"
 IBR.4030.a:0 "Impose the Caudillos will."
 IBR_reformist_tt_28:0 "Limiting factionalism, and therefore restricting different points of view, will §Ymake reformism weaker in the Council.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_18:0 "Uniting the party will §Yincrease the Council's influence.§!"
 IBR.4030.b:0 "Let them quarrel."
 IBR_reformist_tt_29:0 "Allowing different voices to be heard will §Yexpand reformist thought in the Council.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_19:0 "Allowing factionalism to continue will §Ydecrease the Council's influence.§!"

 IBR.4031.t:0 "Families of the Regime: Those That Remain" 
 IBR.4031.d:0 "It would be false to claim that Iberia has been politically stagnant throughout the years. The greatest example is perhaps the creation of the Union itself, although there are many finer details that are overlooked. A few of these details are some of the smaller, less relevant families. The old falangists, the carlists, and the monarchists are only a few of the groups that have slowly withered away to naught.\n\nIberia killed them. They are irrelevant, minor, and it seems that they are going to disappear in a few years. In fact, the only reason they still exist is because they haven't realized they no longer exist. Without our intervention, the end of these groups is certain as other, equally disunited, groups take their place. However, if we so desired, we could perform euthanasia on the dying familes as to make their deaths quick. What will it be?"
 IBR.4031.a:0 "End their suffering."
 IBR_reformist_tt_30:0 "Killing off these factions will §Ymake reformism stronger in the Council.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_20:0 "Killing off these factions will §Yincrease the Council's influence.§!"
 IBR.4031.b:0 "Let them die alone."
 IBR_reformist_tt_31:0 "Leting the ghosts of the past haunt us will §Yweaken reformism in the Council.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_21:0 "Allowing these factions to continue existing will §Yreduce the Council's influence.§!"
 IBR_influence_tt_22:0 "Resolving this issue with diplomacy will §Yincrease the Council's influence.§!"
 
 IBR.4032.t:0 "The Corrected Constitution" 
 IBR.4032.d:0 "The new constitution - or at least, a draft of it - has been published. Copies have been printed in every newspaper possible, and nearly everyone in Iberia will have seen it by now. It certainly seems that way, based on the stir we've created in the government and without. There has been dissent within the government, although it is at a level minimal enough to be curbed.\n\nIt is said that a good compromise leaves nobody happy. According to our political factions, the constitution was a good compromise. Some argue it went too far, and others not far enough, and there is enough of both sides to ensure that there will be an argument over it for a long time to come.\n\nSurely, this is what it will take? The Union will now last forevermore, right?"
 IBR.4032.a:0 "Right."
