 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_MEN_DESC:0 "알렉산드르 블라디미로비치 멘은 많은 이들에게 목동이 되어 달라고, 그의 보살핌 속에 양떼의 생명을 맡겨 달라고, 또는 그들 어깨에 놓여진 천국의 무게를 느껴달라고 부탁한 적이 없다. 그럼에도 불구하고 그는 이 모든 것, 즉 북부의 아버지다. \n\n그러나 그가 항상 그랬던 것은 아니다. 어린 시절 세례를 받은 유대인 아이였던 멘은 여섯 살 때 그의 아버지가 NKVD에 의해 거짓 혐의로 굴라그에 끌려가는 것을 목격하며 전 세계 많은 이들이 그랬듯이 공포와 폭정에 강한 확신을 갖게 되었다. 비록 연방에서의 지하 예배는 위험했지만, 멘은 교리에는 매우 비정통 했으나 독실한 기독교인으로 남아 있을 수 있게 되었다. 성별, 인종, 심지어 신앙까지 초월하는 평등을 굳게 믿는 남자의 사상은 교회 내에서, 아니 연방 전체에서조차 거의 알려지지 않은 것이었다. \n\n연방의 붕괴 이후의 암흑기에, 멘은 얼어붙은 북쪽의 땅에서 고군분투하는 농민들을 위로하고, 그들에게 하느님의 사랑을 전하며, 주님의 사랑을 받아들이지 않는 이들에게는 자신의 말을 전하고 있는 남자 자신의 모습을 발견했다. 그는 그들에게 진정으로 자유로운 남녀의 땅, 평등주의의 땅, 모든 것이 사슬에 묶이지 않을 공동체와 마을이 있는 곳에 대한 희망을 말했다.\n\n그의 믿음과 행동은 시베리아의 고립된 지역사회에서 지지를 모으기 시작했다. 처음에는 천천히, 그리고 한꺼번에, 북쪽의 고립된 마을들은 그들의 아버지에 대한 믿음을 맹세했다. \n\n오늘날 북부는 그토록 오랫동안 성스러운 어머니 조국을 불길에 휩싸이게 한 혼란에 맞서 행진하며, 아버지의 조심스러운 시선으로 고통받는 모든 사람에게 용서와 구원을 가져다 줄 것이다."

There is no room for the complainer, the doubter and the closet secularist in our New Jerusalem, and certainly not in its highest offices.\n\nAs for those who deem it corruption, or accuse us of marrying power to the Church: their courage is well-placed, even if their faith is not.

Patience ranks at the forefront of these tenets; after all, divergences in thought and practice among Earth's manyfold peoples are inevitabilities, like sunrise and sunset. To castigate the different-minded for their very being is akin to accusing a faithful man of heresy for sustaining themselves with loaves of bread rather than the Word of God alone.\n\nIt is with this guided spirit that the Father, in his capacity as God's ordained intercessor, decrees the protection of all faiths under His ever-present watch: the Jews, the Muslims, the pagans, and the thousand others that had sprung forth after Creation. Heaven has all eternity to await their adherents' return; until then, the fleeting Kingdom on Earth shall shelter them to its utmost."

There is no denying that his men are effective on the battlefield and he has many connections to those who may help our cause, but Father Men sees his conduct as barbarous and unchristian. By working closely with Sudoplatov we might be able to bring the Father's word to all of Russia, but we must be careful that we do not lose sight of our values if we do.

The Father agrees that a formal police force to maintain public order is necessary, but Sudoplatov wishes to go several steps further. He has asked that his men be authorized to enforce discipline in the villages and communes of the Mandate. This would be a step back towards the tyranny of the NKVD, but it may be a necessary step.

Their methods are unchristian but there's no denying how effective they are. Sudoplatov has offered to use their talents against our enemies.

If a few unchristian acts could save thousands of Christian lives and prevent untold suffering, would it not also be unchristian not to act and condemn so many good children of the Lord to perish?

After months of intensifying conflict between the two, Sudoplatov's demands have finally stopped coming in. It appears a new equilibrium has been reached. Either Sudoplatov has finally accepted Men's teachings and realized the error of his old ways, or the Father has succumbed to enough of his temptations that he is ready to escalate his campaign to reform Siberia to the next level.

Thereso did the Father lead us all in prayer, singing the hymns to bless this land, hoping one day for a home of homes, inheriting the meek and lowly to find new life above all. There did the winter winds scar the walls, yet the fires of faith protected all who stood in prayer, blanketed neath the holy words of the Father, as he brought our souls closer to the heavens than any other in Russia could know. Here was where there were songs and prayers and cries, where the men and women of these far-off lands came together under the watchful eyes of our Father. And here was where the light of the LORD has been brought, and the flame of missionarian life was birthed into the world.\n\nAs the great and powerful Father watched on, it was his dear followers who brought forth the notion of spreading the faith across these frozen lands. It was by the Father's will, by God's will, as our great Father rests, we shall burn the way for the LORD in Russia!"

Weary from their travels, yet nevermore wishing for the corruption of decadence to strike the heart of our Home again. Thus what needed to be done was ordered forth by our Father: the moneylender's banks were forced closed, shutting out the serpent of Sin. The bandit was arrested that day, to be tried on order of violations of the Holy Scripture. And the embezzler, how greatly did he plead as he was brought away from his wretched place of sloth and greed. However, as the crackling of gunfire began, so greatly did the Fratern return hostilities, sending our Father into a fit of remorse as our soldiers so greatly went forth, bringing the burning judgement of the LORD down!\n\nAnd thus, in accordance with the will of the LORD, so too did the village burn that day, so that holy fires may cleanse this land from putridity and sin. However, as the soldiers, the judges of Mankind under one holy God, cried out in praise and victory, so greatly did our Father fall to his knees, as the night sky adorned his cloak with the flakes of heavenly frost.

It shall be the Day of Reckoning for every barbarian, tyrant, and cultist, as the Father journeys forward to bring the light of God to the fiendish wastes.\n\nAnd so greatly did the Father take up the podium of God, speaking out to the select few beside him, but with a voice heard round the taigas. "Brothers and Sisters of this bright world. Is it not we who bring forward the promises of God from the scriptures into the world? Yes, it is true: our home of Russia has come under the despair of bandits, dictators, and marauders. But know this, brothers and sisters: as it says in the scriptures, 'Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.'

It was only by the Eleventh hour, however, that the sun began to shine across the city, and thus give light upon the christened forces of the North. Thus was when every armed man, mercenary and native alike, drew to the city walls, preparing for the potential outbreak of violence that could consume the city, and bring ruin to every family inside. It was Matkovsky who organized these men, as the bright sun shone down on every potential combatant that day, shining a great light upon the Father, as he drew closer to the gates of Magadan as if wandering the gates of Heaven.\n\nFurthermore, it was Matkovsky who marched downwards through the City Gates, realizing the sharp truth regarding the bloodbath which had been prophesied to follow for weeks on end now. This was it, the time was now for Magadan to siege hell against the Northern invaders who sought to undo the progress of the local leader, Matkovsky. And maybe, just maybe, could he secure for himself a means of escape if everything went according to plan.\n\nThe next few hours shed an ocean of blood deep into the Siberian snow.

Nevertheless, they all found themselves at the mercy of the merciful Father that day, with the Matkovsky having been caught in a damaged vehicle in a dash to escape the burning city. So great was the LORD that day to provide his mercy, to provide a new light of life for the once-living Matkovsky: to be the Scribe Sergius, destined to follow the Father's holy hymn throughout the lands of Russia."

Not prophetic nor apocalyptic scriptures gouging for reclamation and vindication, but the truest showcase of God our Father could muster in his mind: beautiful, awe-inspiring, and loving.

Emperor of the Universe! Triumph of David! His voice spoke syllables at one with the speech of angels, and as he trembled, the warm touch of the Savior embraced him: not in judgement, but in love.\n\nCome, my servant, the Lord whispered.

Beyond a few abandoned mining towns, isolated Chukchi villages and wandering nomads, the area was assumed to be more or less abandoned. A few madmen were said to occasionally find their way up there, attempting to establish their own "empire" in the cold, but the land bitterly refused to be tamed.\n\nThis state of anarchy has now ended.\n\nIt began with the hymns. Travellers brought tales of entire villages united in prayer, singing songs of hope and peace in the name of the Lord. This hardly seemed unusual - Russia has been a godly land even through the days of the Union. But when many travellers all began speaking the same tales coming from so many different villages, our leaders began to suspect that something was amiss. Now, we know why.\n\nAn emissary has arrived in our midst from the now united north. He came only to deliver a message - a message of judgement delivered from his master, the so-called "Father Men". This Father has proclaimed the entirety of the north to belong to a single union in the name of God. Declaring that we have committed grievous sin and besmirched the lands of Holy Russia, he has vowed to lead his flock of faithful against us and deliver unto us two things. Divine wrath, and divine salvation.\n\nWe had hoped that this was some trick, but already our scouts are reporting movement on the northern borders. The north is indeed coming, and their hymns grow louder and louder by the day. We must ready our forces to meet this army of zealots head on.\n\nIt would seem, however, that there are some amongst us who would rather leave this place and pledge their life in the name of this mad crusade."

 OMO.30.t:0 "심판을 기다리다"
 OMO.30.d:0 ""Father, it is very good to see you," Sudoplatov said as Alexander Men stepped through the door into the small room. "Have a seat, there are some... things I wish to talk about."\n\nMen sat down in the small chair, saying coldly, "I believe it is I who has something to say first, Sudoplatov." Men paused, watching Sudoplatov's reaction. "Are you betraying me, Pavel?"\n\n"What, I would never, where are you getting these ideas?" Sudoplatov said unaware Men knew of his plot. This was supposed to go the other way around! Had he miscalculated?\n\n"Well, it appears your NKVD divisions are taking your orders, not mine." Men said. "You've also been collecting funds and my generals are reporting weapons disappearing. I believe you've gained too much power, Sudoplatov. Chadek, Clovis, come in here, please. Your temptations have failed to turn me and you have betrayed no one but God himself." Men stood up to leave Sudoplatov to his fate.\n\nSudoplatov dropped to the feet of Men, begging. "Wait, I'll repent! I'll repent! Please, I was just trying to give us a chance at actually reunifying Russia. I promise I'll remain loyal, please."\n\nMen looked down at the man at his feet. He was sure Sudoplatov was hiding something. Was he really repenting, or was it all a lie? Still, Men was always supposed to forgive, wasn't he? Would it be hypocritical to let Sudoplatov rot in some cell?"

 OMO.31.t:0 "아버지께서 선종하시다!"
 OMO.31.d:0 "The rabblerourser Alexander Men is reported missing and possibly dead, and with him the so-called 'Holy Siberia' has collapsed into warring factions, proving how little the faith he claimed to uphold spread beyond his sermons. With no central command in the theocracy, there is nothing stopping us from unifying the Far East under our banner. We must strike immediately, before another demagogue rises and threatens the unity of Siberia!"

 OMO.32.t:0 "죄인들의 설교"
 OMO.32.d:0 "Thus sayeth the Gospel according to Luke: "The spirit of the lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed."\n\n"How corrupted must one's soul be to deserve imprisonment? Ought a schoolchild failing an exam from stress be thrown into the Siberian depths for the failures of his labor? Brothers and Sisters, I say to you today that coal-filled depths of this slave camp, built to forge railroads and produce riches with which none here may keep, houses not criminals, but mistreated Brothers and Sisters, just like you or I. Imagine a reckless, smiling child falling deep into the depths of the Lake Baikal. Would it be our duty, as parents to children of this world, to hold the child under, to allow the frostbite and drowning to suffice as punishment for his mistakes? Or would it not be right to fight for our child, to rescue him and ensure his soul is secured in this right, and aid him to become better throughout all his efforts. This is how we ought to, no, how we must treat these fallen men who've frozen in their own Lake Baikal for so long, as the soot has burned their lungs and the callouses enveloped their hands. Let them be in the midst of you or me, and we shall lead them to a new life."\n\nIt was then that all manner of man, woman, and child set forth to labor into the depths of the Amurlag. No longer slaves breaking rocks at the crack of the whip; no, these were God's chosen, freeing and releasing those brothers and sisters deemed "dangerous" by tyrants long past, and allowing them to become Children of the LORD."

 OMO.33.t:0 "가장 높은 천상의 봄"
 OMO.33.d:0 "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. And, yet, with the smiling faces and brightened days brought upon so many, our Father could not help but feel the pull of the LORD most closely, rather than deciding to kneel down to the unfaithful.\n\nIt was thus that our Father found himself descending the grand staircase of his grander cathedral, and finding himself trudging through the endless frosted snowfall to reach the city square upon the bank of the Omolon. As the farmhand and the soldier looked on, and the crowd began to form, it was our Father who mounted the podium donning the square. Here, our great Father finally got a closer, more personal look into so many of his followers' beautiful, captivating eyes, and he finally began to perform the holy sanctities as he foresaw them. Assembled, stepping down and working throughout the crowd, speaking softly into the ear with a kind hand upon their soldier. The people were calmed, they were blessed, and they were happy. For this mass was not like the ones ignited by the fire of conquest by some of these meek folk; rather, this was one of joy, of tranquility, of peace.\n\nIt was here that our Father noticed some of the more retreated faces of the unfaithful, looking down upon the Earth as if in shame, in regret. And it was here that our Father navigated towards them, and embraced them: for difference and disagreement shall not tear a family asunder."

 OMO.34.d:0 "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. It was knowing this that guided our Father upon what to do, as in knowing that not every man was so pious among a land of the devout called for a compromise for the betterment of all man.\n\nThus, it was shown that the most devoted and the most fervent believers of the faith of our God, the Holy Trinity who gave way for our life were assembled earlier than all others for the Mass that day. Some offered scorn and insult against the other men and women who labored early and could not, or chose not, to attend the Holy Assembly; however, with our Father's guiding words, they were hushed from all disrespect. Mass was made with haste and with purpose, allowing for the devotee to Emmanuel to find himself able to worship in spirit. All others of Omolon watched as the Father concluded his rushed Mass far earlier than the others, striking a note of confusion and fear within some of the peasantry who had assembled in worrying what the Father may have planned for those who disregarded the mass, fearing as all others had feared for disagreement in years prior.\n\nBut persecution was not the answer, nor the heavy hand of oppression and scorn. No, rather, it was the hour to assemble for the poor, the lowly, and the hungry of their land. Every servant to our Father and thus our LORD came that day, bearing gifts of bread and soup and pleasantries to be handed out to all who starved on the streets of Omolon. And sang and praised and feasted they did, as the notes of Church Hymns alongside the Russian folksong gave joy to the mind of our Father."

 OMO.35.d:0 "It was upon the Seventh day of the LORD's week that our Father looked upon the lowly and formerly disheartened who now joined alongside his holy dominion in hopes of bringing about a new era of Christian devotion. In his wisdom, however, he knew so easily that not all were so devoted to the Church and the belief in God; rather, it was the fiery image of unity which they clinged to, politics over religion, action over faith. In his primary duty to the LORD above all, our Father knew it was right to render obedience to him and him alone; however, was it not truly right to serve the crowds of unbelievers out there, who commit to good works in this life despite a lack of faith?\n\nThis question tested our Father as he stepped down from his living quarters and descended from his cathedral on the bank of the Omolon, where night skies still hung over an early morning. All manner of devotees made their way to his doorstep for morning Mass; yet, it was not what they found. Rather, our Father recognized the need to forge a new assembly for all men, rather than just his select devoted. And thus did he muster men of all kinds to assemble a new experience to enjoy, one found not oft within the frozen lands of Siberia: that of a festival. Of course, the LORD Almighty was showcased in some of the imagery at the festival that day, but never was it made to be the end-all be-all for the assembled that day. Nay, for it was the duty of all who assembled that day to love and drink and feast and make merry, as was right for them to do, and enjoy themselves in their fractured state of this world.\n\nNevertheless, our Father abandoned not his hardworking children. For when they had come to believe that they must abandon the Sabbath that day, it was our Father who picked them up through the night, and assembled them into his cathedral. And there they celebrated the sacraments, broke bread and gave thanks, and made peace with the LORD, in the quiet of the night."

 OMO.36.t:0 "주님은 나의 힘과 방패이시니"
 OMO.36.d:0 "The riverbank of Omolon held not the lowly city of those abandoned by tyrants of olde days yonder; no, for this had become far more under the guiding love of God Almighty. A dominion of the devoted, a dominion of laborers, soldiers, fathers, and sons, and a dominion of Emmanuel himself. All to be had under the Vessel of our God, our Father himself. Yet, Omolon hadn't contained the work of our Father to just a riverbank; rather, this fortress of God stretched across the Russian nation, for all to hear and rejoice!\n\nHowever, the marauder, the despot, and the cultist gave not cries of glory and salvation; rather, they cried with a burning hate, as they prepared their arms and ammunitions for the days to come, and the deciding fate of the land of God's chosen, having come so far from the depths of the tundra to bring forth the light of the LORD. Nevermore was this to be a land of destruction wrought by the wrathful and the persecutor, for this was to be God's Kingdom on Earth, and it is under the banner of Our Father that we shall guide ourselves towards such redemption for all who would bear the name Russian. The peaceful, loving, tranquil nature of our LORD was never to be dismissed through all we had done; however, the men of our world do not understand such notions taught throughout the scriptures, and thus necessitated the just hand of a more Old Testament, bringing forth the justice and fear of our God through the fields of war, so that we may triumph over the conquests of Gehenna in this battered world.\n\nThe burning fields gave no images of power and glory to the mind of our Father, however. As he continued to stare, he knew this was no way for mankind to act to one another, to tear each other apart without retraction. One day, this world would see the last of its war and embrace one another in the workings of our LORD's love. And on that day, our Father swore, he would rest."

 OMO.37.t:0 "Evil Made Flesh"
 OMO.37.d:0 "Thus sayeth the LORD, by the hand of Isaiah: ""Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression, to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!"\n\nNaught but whispers adorned the shining crest of OMOLON, whereupon our Father knelt, whereupon our Father prayed, and whereupon our Father wept. The wicked claws of Lucifer's inferno had gripped the harrowed Earth time and again, as the teachings of the Theologians and Priests journeyed through the mind of the teary-eyed Father. Echoes of the Antichrist, as they had been declared by the scribes, have come time and again to haunt the world in their deadly shadows of Sin: the Mad Emperor who dared watch Rome burn, the drunken Tsar who threw his wrath down on his son, the She-Queen who bathed in the blood of her people, and even the "Master of Europe" upon the throne of the Eagle-Empire. Yet, none had reached such heights of being as sickening, as depraved, as wretched, and as wicked as the Born-Again Nebuchadnezzar to the West, he who leaves naught but an inferno in his maddened wrath, in the search for his long-dead King. He who would not, nay, could not reign over the lands of Russia, lest the world burn upon his Throne of Insanity! Hours of prayer, hours of praying to the LORD, all had led our Father to raise his head, and gaze upon the face of the crucified LORD in the chapel, and realize one grave truth: this was the Abomination of Desolation. He who would oppose Christ himself. This was no Echo of the Antichrist, but the Antichrist himself.\n\nThus did our Father grip his robe so tightly, crying out in anguish towards the countless souls butchered under this Abaddon's wicked gaze. And thus did our Father cry out to all men and women that day, readying all who gazed and listening to march to war, not for the glory of OMOLON, but to shield the world from Azazel's wickedness!"

 OMO.38.t:0 "Against the Winds"
 OMO.38.d:0 "Russia, after years of constant warfare, of the oppression of Bolshevism and Fascism, of the tyranny of warlords, knows true peace. The people, that once were led by false prophets, and insidious ideologies that brought no contentment to a hungry soul finally know peace in God's tender guidance.\n\nAnd yet, why does Men's heart weigh so much?\n\nAlexander Men, the Father, guider of the lost and the poor, is mortal and fallible as the rest; for what manner of Shepard feels no fear or anxiety over their growing flock? What were once dozens, escalated into hundreds, thousands, and the millions. Each and everyone looks to him like a guiding star, a symbol for hope long lost even before Hitler, thrice-cursed his name, brought the gates of Hell towards Russia and her faithful.\n\nThe Reich. Germany. That's the source of his fear. The winds coming from the West bring more chills and frostbite than the harshest Siberian winter, for the west lies Moscowien, the forgotten people of Russia, living in a state of fear and submission over the Eagle Empire's Banner.\n\nIt wouldn't end here, and Alexander knew it. The Shade of the Anti-Christ would not tolerate the existence of his eternal enemy near him, and no good man would not gaze away and let his people suffer under the heirs of the Snake that denied Humanity their place in Paradise.\n\nUnder the Cross did the humble shepherd prayers intensify, hands whitening as he grasps the Chaplet with all strength he can muster. Men couldn't turn his gaze away from the Russians still under the Masters of Europe. And so he prayed, for the souls that were lost, to the souls still to be lost, and the souls he could save in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."
