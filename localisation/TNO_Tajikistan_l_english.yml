 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_HINDUSTONI_DESC: "'Hindustoni' - or Hindustani, an ephithet given to Muhammadjon Rustamov, who left Central Asia during the Bolshevik revolution to continue his studies of Islam first in Afghanistan and then in India (sometimes referred to as Hindustan). Such an education has but redoubled his determined faith and resolve to maintain the old ways in his home country, as they have been for decades prior.\n\nIf the titanic catastrophe that has befallen the people of Tajikistan is indicative of anything, it is only the side-effects of their previous trial's completion. Decades of godless communism and oppression were the test for true believers, and those who have remained steadfast and firm can now carve a truly Islamic state from the ashes of that which was always damned to collapse. Islam was never the movement of radicals or extremists - it was and is the faith of those quiet, determined men who can withstand persecution from all quarters and come out as faithful as ever.\n\nNow, Hindustoni stands as the guarantor of the Islamic State of Tajikistan - a moderate, conservative, traditionalist nation founded on those ideals that have served the Tajik people so well in the past. Getting caught in the heady winds of revolution or radicalism is a recipe for disaster - and so he will defend the nation against those winds until the fruits of slow, steady, and steadfast labour reveal themselves."
 POLITICS_NUSRATULLO_DESC: "The Tajik people have been betrayed more times than anyone can count. First the Russians came dressed in gaudy Imperial robes, and squeezed the nation for all it was worth. Then, they came  in the clothes of peasants, proclaiming the unity of the working classes and the triumph of the proletariat - but in the end their goals remained the same as before.\n\nBut when they fell, destroyed by the Germans in their hubris and frailty, it was the Tajik nations' brothers in blood - enslaved under the Afghan Kingdom - who came knocking once more for the riches of the land. The communists who knew how to lick the boots of Moscow's elites faltered and failed abysmally at serving the people in those dire times - how could they do anything but, having only ever served an alien master - and finally, the people have spoken. They will have naught to do with foreign masters or foreign ideologies.\n\nThey have chosen to raise as their leader Nusratullo Abdulkhakov - a true man of Tajikstan, who will unite under their banner all the Tajik people scattered as they are across the lands. Finally, for the first time this century, the people are ruled by one of their own, and the time is ripe for the nation to take its rightful place in Central Asia."
 POLITICS_BOBODZHAN_GAFUROV_DESC: "Few men are as loyal and devoted to socialism as much as Bobodzhan Gafurov. Gafurov is well-known as a hardliner, faithful to communism ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, and is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Tajikistan. Initially a historian, he quickly climbed the ranks of the Party to become its leader. While the country may have seceded from the Soviet Union as it was falling under the German jackboot, he still holds out for another communist power to resurge and take back control.\n\nEven as the West Russian Revolutionary Front and the Kazakh Red Army collapsed in the West Russian War and its aftermath, Gafurov kept his loyalty and still maintains close ties with the neighboring Kyzylorda. Even though he knows he is not the best to lead his nation through these turbulent times, seeing as he is not an expert in politics, he still has declined to give away his power to anyone. This is not due to his autocratic tendencies, but his ideology and beliefs: Gafurov has not found anyone he has deemed worthy of bearing the torch of socialism in the country, and so has kept control.\n\nStill, day by day; the General Secretary's control is slowly slipping away. The members of the Politburo, the small governing body of the nation, begin to lose loyalty to their leader. Meanwhile, dissidents opposed to the government prepare to take matters into their own hands and bring down the system which has so clearly failed. Gafurov's reign might soon be coming to an end."
 POLITICS_BURINISO_BERDIEVA_DESC: "Buriniso Beredieva is a young woman for politics, only born in 1927 in Penjikent, the world she knew was one quickly undone by the upheavals of the Twentieth Century. Many of her generation could easily be considered lost, between the devastation of the Second World War and the following wards, many Tajiks have considered the age they are born in to be utterly lost to them. Buriniso, on the other hand, has risen above her circumstances.\n\nShe remained in Tajikistan, rather than fleeing to the Kyrgyz, or Afghanistan to the south. The first Tajik journal- known as Knowledge and Civilization- was penned by her press. Not only was this a way for the common Tajik to remain up-to-date on the ever-changing matters of the day, as well as granting the Tajik people another piece of common ground upon which they could unite. It should be no surprise then, that in some way, she is seen as a mother to the young nation.\n\nWith the democratic revolution complete, Buriniso has defied the odds, and in spite of the conservative tendencies of her people, found herself elected to the head of the Tajik nation. Her mandate is simple as it is sweeping, to build up the nation and its civic spirit, to revitalize Tajik culture, and to secure the nation's long-term viability in the process. Buriniso does not have an easy road ahead of her, but the road ahead has never been easy for Tajikistan, and as before, so now, she will rise to the challenge, and so will her people."

 ### Ideas ###
 TAJ_flooded_streets: "Flooded Streets" 
 TAJ_flooded_streets_desc: "To call Tajikistan an exhausted nation would be understating the obvious. The people are tired, and cynicism is rampant in the streets and at home. The government is the subject of great skepticism and mistrust, as both socialism and the war against the Afghans have concluded in much the same way. Failure.\n\nThe streets are flooded, not with water, but with outrage and discontent. The regime is doing all that it can to keep the waves of ire and rage at bay, but it's becoming abundantly clear that something will give eventually, it's just a matter of what and when."
 TAJ_fading_economy: "Fading Economy"
 TAJ_fading_economy_desc: "In all of the world, Tajikistan has found herself with two trade partners in total. With the general isolation of the region from the rest of the world, and the embargos from Iran and Afghanistan, only Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan remain as trading partners.\n\nThey know our desperation, and they negotiate accordingly. Famine is rampant in Tajikistan, and the economy suffers more by the day, withering like a vine without water to sustain it. Something must be done, and options are few."
