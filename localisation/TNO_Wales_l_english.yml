 WAL_Welsh_CounterCulture:0 "Welsh Cultural Revolution"
 WAL_Welsh_CounterCulture_desc:0 "Ever since Wales fell to England, English culture and language has threatened to snuff out that of the Welshmen. Our unglamorous liberation has given the Welsh people an opportunity to reclaim what was once in danger of being lost. The Welsh tongue is once more being spoken beyond the meetings of fringe nationalist parties and in isolated villages, great works from all the earth are being translated into Welsh while poets and authors create new, original works in kind.\n\nThe Dragon, once thought dead or dying, now roars with a new life!"
 WAL_Free_Welsh_Army:0 "자유 웨일스군"
 WAL_Free_Welsh_Army_desc:0 "For some, freedom alone is not enough. Operating outside of our control and beyond our reach is the Free Welsh Army, a paramilitary force who has been no small source of trouble for both Wales and England. Beyond their rallies and marches- in which they espouse dangerous, anti-English sentiment that continually strain relations with our biggest trade partner- they have frequently attacked Englishmen both in Wales and along the border. We had hoped that appointing Cayo-Evans, with his connections to them, as our Defense Minister would calm their rage, but we have no idea how long the leash will hold..."

The Y Mab Darogan has through his wisdom and will managed to achieve what every government prior has failed, and solidified the Welsh production centre solidly. The factories might not provide work for all the people of Wales but they will help us keep the loyalty of the urban majority, quite possibly our greatest potential threat at the moment with the welsh speaking populace being confined mostly to the north and interior."
 WAL_RTP:0 "Reinforced Police"
 WAL_RTP_desc:0 "The police are well capable of handling ordinary dissent, but the Anglo populace are a terrifyingly devious band of ruffians. Protests will be large as they fool honest Welshmen into acting against their own interests, the solution to this is rather simple. Expand the police, fill their ranks with the loyal, or those who are at least competent, and crack down on the malicious. We can search for foreign infiltrators whilst we are at it, round up the more influential Anglo leaders with our loyalists in the police and imprison them for as long we need."
 WAL_StrictControl:0 "Economic Supervision"
 WAL_StrictControl_desc:0 "The economy is a machine, it ticks onwards constantly and with incredibly delicate instruments. A single spanner in the works could well leave the entire machine in jeopardy, a spanner like the Anglo population for instance. The government will have advisors in every factory, every business above a certain size, there will be no opportunity whatsoever for saboteurs or incompetence to deviate the machine of the economy away from its dedicated course. Naturally we will try to not be too intrusive, but omelettes and eggs and so on."
 WAL_CLA:0 "Celtic Liberation Army Member"
 WAL_CLA_desc:0 "The Celtic Liberation Army is despite being established in Wales a force for all the Celtic peoples of the world. Bretons, Scots, Manx, Irishmen and Welshmen all serve in one united force dedicated to the preservation of the unique Celtic cultures and their ways of life. Ironically despite many attempts the disparate nature of the organisation requires much of the communication to be done in English, something which is said to annoy the higher ranking members of the CLA to no end. "
 WAL_WelshNatRevSupa:0 "Welsh National Revolution"
 WAL_WelshNatRevSupa_desc:0 "The Welsh National Revolution is one the finest brainchilds of Julian Cayo-Evans, the Y Mab Darogan. Based to some extent upon the socialist theories albeit purified for use in Wales, Cayo-Evans in his National Revolution has postulated that a constant revolution which evolves to face the challenges as they come is better than a defined period after which Anglo influences might creep back into society. Naturally this renders Wales somewhat unstable but it also makes them an oddly flexible power on matters of ideology."
 WAL_DeportAnglos:0 "Deporting the Anglos"
 WAL_DeportAnglos_desc:0 "The deportation of the Anglo populace that once resided in Wales is one of the final pieces of the Free Wales Army's National Revolution. The Anglo populations which were accounted for are rounded up and trucked enmasse to English border towns, usually with some of their belongings but not often a great number of them. The loot seized is granted to the state or, depending upon the nature of the confiscating officer in question, himself. Naturally there is a not insignificant amount of resistance to the deportations."
 WAL_ExpandFWA:0 "Expanding the Free Wales Army"
 WAL_ExpandFWA_desc:0 "The FWA is the backbone of the Welsh State under Julian Cayo-Evans, an ideological force equally as much as a purely security one. With a heavy degree of emphasis on superior soldiery to their likely English foes, the recent expansion of the FWA has only made it an even deadlier force. The new fighters in the FWA might not be as well trained or disciplined as those which came before but they more than make up for their deficiency in training with utter fanaticism."
 WAL_TWNA:0 "The Welsh National Assembly"
 WAL_TWNA_desc:0 "The Welsh National Assembly is to be the cornerstone of the new legislative process, taking a great deal of weight off of the position of Y Mab Darogan and transferring some of the formative legislative responsibilities to the Assembly as a whole. Naturally the Y Mab Darogan holds both veto and significant influence in the process of deciding the fine print of any passed laws but this is the closest to a representative organ that the Welsh people have had in some time. Even if Cayo-Evans does choose who sits in it."

 WAL_CayoCentralize_desc:0 "The position of Y Mab Darogan is one of great responsibility, which is why only Julian Cayo-Evans can be allowed to have it. He has freed Wales from its shackles of Unionism and the Anglo traitors that use it as a shield, he has strengthened Wales by pruning away from it the weak links, the deceitful and the cowards. Some may call him a despot, but he is our despot if so. A man utterly dedicated to the future of his nation and the success of his people. A man dedicated to Wales, to victory, and to the National Revolution!"

 #Leader bios
 POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "There are many unlikely things that fit together. But what about a poetic politician, a dramatist clinging to power in an increasingly authoritarian state? Regardless of the irony one may find in this oxymoron, this is just what Saunders Lewis, the leader of the juvenile Welsh nation, embodies.\n\nAfter being wounded in combat during the First World War on the western front, Lewis lectured at Swansea. The trouble of Welsh independence led the Welshman and some of his associates to eventually found a nationalist political party, which later became known as the Plaid Cymru. Lewis, as the first party leader, was unable to garner much support with his reinvention of Welsh nationalism, having minor success only when he published new literary works. However, the Second World War came as a decisive turning point. As the Plaid Cymru promoted "service to the Welsh nation instead of to the British," the Germans found a convenient way to avoid occupying Wales in favor of concentrating the war effort on the Scottish campaign. Thus, Wales was given its independence, for the Germans' convenience first and foremost. The Plaid Cymru, meanwhile, accelerated its rise by being appointed the leading party of this new nation.\n\nHowever, many years have elapsed since Saunders Lewis's inauguration. The old man has lost all his zeal and vigor, and has retreated to the countryside to continue his literary work. Lewis's clique is thus forced to desperately cling to power via increasingly autocratic means. One may wonder how long they can hold on, though, as numerous factions emerge to fill the vacuum that Lewis's isolation has created."
 POLITICS_WELSH_ASSEMBLY_DESC:0 "When the independence of Wales was hoisted upon itself by the Reich, it needed a place to organise its government. The obvious answer was the former Cardiff Town Hall, a building of impressive stature and even more impressive architecture, as built in 1905 in the Edwardian Baroque style, covered in various statues of Welsh and British legends. Adjusting the city hall to fit the assembly was not too difficult a task, as the room was slightly expanded to allow for more seats to fit the assembly within. And here, in Cardiff's fifth town hall, sits a worried government, uncertain of its own future.\n\nWhen coal stocks began depleting, Prime Minister Lewis and his wing of Plaid Cymru saw the writing on the wall. But to get ahead, he threw everything he could to stop the public from discovering the little secret. Plaid fabricated as much as they could, burned as many records, destroyed as much as possible. But they got him eventually. As a vote of no confidence threw out Prime Minister Lewis, the government collapsed in on itself. At one point, a brawl erupted between two Plaid members, until it was broken up.\n\nNow, as factions duel, the future of the Welsh Government seems to be under contention, and Wales burns in the same fire that is draining the economic fuel it so dearly needs."
 POLITICS_JULIAN_CAYO-EVANS_DESC:0 "Some men's fathers drive them to change the world. Others have mothers who build them into warriors of compassion. Cayo-Evans, on the other hand, was driven into radical nationalism by his housekeeper. A Polish soldier in exile who felt the sting of Britain's abandonment, Yanick Helkzman taught Julian that a nation can rely on nobody but its native soldiers. Cayo was determined to be one of those soldiers, ready to join in the victorious struggle for a Free Wales. Unfortunately, Cayo learned that independence was just the first of many questions in need of answers.\n\nBefore helping establish the Free Welsh Army, Cayo was rumored to have spent a year serving in Iberia's Guardia Civil, having grown increasingly infatuated with the independence and staunch nationalism he saw in Franco. Undeniably, the Cayo who founded the FWA was one significantly more aggressive in his hatred for not just communism, but parliamentary democracy itself. Such views, despite not being universal in the FWA, nonetheless gave him a strong support base, so strong that Saunders Lewis eventually viewed ignoring the man as dangerous. At the time, perhaps, Lewis believed Cayo could still be brought to heel, could be drawn to the rearguard of the Plaid parliament. Clearly, the vociferous criticisms Cayo's appointment faced were correct. As feared (or hoped for in some circles), he used the first chance he got to take the government at gunpoint. Now, the strongest opponent of Anglicization and Liberalism has seized power in the land of the dragon, thousands of hardened warriors at his beck and call."
 POLITICS_JOHN_MORRIS_DESC:0 "John Morris has always claimed to be pragmatic and apolitical. When the Welsh flag flew across the liberated land, Morris was in his study practicing for a legal exam. When a strike in his native Aberystwyth erupted to show solidarity with Northern coal miners, Morris simply drew his curtains and played a record. Unsurprisingly, his first entry into politics came not through collective action, but through a case he was assigned to.\n\nThis succesful defense of a English immigrant accused of murder made national headlines, and led Morris to be courted by a small group of Anglophile politicians. Stewarding the "apolitical" man in ideas of free trade, deregulation, and internationalism, this Independent group basically wrote the entire campaign Morris ran for the Aberavon seat. In parliament, however, he quickly became convinced that the future greatness of Wales lied not with hollow liberalism, but the strong social democracies of yore. As it turned out, this strategy was a success, allowing Morris to pull in significant numbers of Cymru Goch members, much to Thomas' dismay. Finding himself a leader of this new Labour party, Morris deftly maneuvered the various crises and scandals of the Lewis administration to aim directly for the Prime Minister's seat. With Goch essentially absorbed into Labour, Morris led his party to victory with him solidly at the helm. The once "apolitical" man is looking forward to a stable road towards a united, social-democratic Britain."
 POLITICS_EMRYS_THOMAS_DESC:0 "To say that Emrys Thomas is a man of the labour movement would be an understatement.\n\nHe was born into it, molded by it. Growing up in one of the coal centers of Wales and raised by parents active in the Independent Labour party his path as a socialist politician fighting for the working man of Wales was obvious in hindsight.\n\nThe school teacher would spend the first part of his political career working himself up to party representative of South Wales and advocating for conscious objectors during World War 2. The end of the war found Thomas seeing his homeland at last independent from the English yoke.\n\nAs London was stomped under the German boot, Thomas joined Saunders grand coalition in an effort to represent the interest of the miners and contain the unionist. That is until the Language bill blew everything apart.\n\nWith the Frankenstein government of Plaid Cymru now in the rear mirror, Thomas' victory will finally allow him to reform Wales into the democratic socialist nation he has always desired."

WAL_Free_Wales:0 "A Free Wales"
WAL_Free_Wales_desc:0 "Wales is a young nation, but it is also an old country. As such, it has the privilege of dealing with problems that commonly afflict nations both young and old, such as the wild and often misguided actions of our political fringe and extremist youths. But there are also those with an unfairly nostalgic view of the past- they call themselves Unionists, others call them traitors- and would see Wales return to a union with England and the rest of the Isles.\n\nThere is no man better equipped to handle this precarious situation than our own Saunders Lewis, and ever since he became our Prime Minister he has handled the problems with dignity and grace. But the wear and the tear is starting to show, and whether his patience or his health catches up with him first is yet to be seen. God willing, we should be able to resolve the looming crisis before then, because there's no telling if whoever comes next will have the ability to."
WAL_Open_The_Floor:0 "Opening Parliament"
WAL_Open_The_Floor_desc:0 "Parliament will soon be in session, though this time it's a good deal more controversial than it has been in the past. Aside from a number of significant pieces of legislature that will be presented to the Parliament when it opens, there's also the Annual Economic Assessment to consider. The Assessments manage to strike a delicate balance between incendiary and painfully dry, with the Cymru Plaid receiving a great deal of the frustration from years of middling-to-weak economic growth.\n\nRegardless, the show must go on, and a show this is expected to be. It seems like the parliament grows ever more stratified and less cooperative with every time it goes into session, and some are wondering if there's any hope that the parties emerge from this next one with national unity and cooperation in mind."
WAL_Annual_Economic_Assessment:0 "The Annual Economic Assessment"
WAL_Annual_Economic_Assessment_desc:0 "The time has come for the Annual Economic Assessment. Gywnfor Evans- presumably after not finding anyone willing to pass it onto- has the dubious honor of presenting the Assessment to all of the Parliament, and how they receive the news will determine the party's economic platform moving into the year coming up.\n\nThere are already whispers that the report carries a message that is far from positive. While there hasn't been any outright decline in overall prosperity, imports have increased dramatically while exports have fallen in kind. Inflation is also a looming threat over the country, as the drive to create a distinctly Welsh currency to replace the Pound may have been somewhat overzealous for as small a nation as Wales. The job of telling the increasingly dysfunctional parliament this is as unenviable as any."
WAL_Welfare_qn:0 "The Welfare Debate"
WAL_Welfare_qn_desc:0 "One of the most controversial topics emerging from the Assessment comes in the form of the welfare debate. Wales has a reasonably strong system of financial safety nets and government welfare, primarily supported by the social democrats within Plaid Cymru. After seeing the stagnation of the national budget, hardlining right-wingers with the Plaid Cymru have taken to roundly criticizing the programs and calling for austerity- or even abolishing the welfare state altogether.\n\nOn the other hand, the left wing of the party insists that when times get tough, it's the poor and the working class that bear the brunt of the weight. With solutions ranging from maintaining it to increasing their budgets, there has been a solid and cohesive defense of Welsh welfare in the face of this call against it."
WAL_Coal_qn:0 "The Coal Question"
WAL_Coal_qn_desc:0 "After the strained silence that the parliament held all throughout the Assessment, the time has come to develop a plan that can get the Welsh economy back on track. Something that the report stressed was that Wales as a nation is incredibly dependent on its coal exports. While this reliance doesn't seem to be a cause of the recent slowing of Welsh economic growth, there are those who think that this reliance makes the economy entirely too fragile. After all, should something happen to either disrupt Wales' ability to acquire its coal, or should coal fall even further out of international favor than it has already, the results would be devastating.\n\nThere are those who argue otherwise though. The fact that Wales lives and dies by its coal exports is not new information, and that there is nothing to fear from relying on coal. The argument goes that leaning so heavily on the export of coal gives Wales a kind of strength, not fragility, and ensures that they won't be investing in any overly optimistic or ambitious investments that could ruin them in turn..."
WAL_Workers_rights_qn:0 "The Rights of Workers"
WAL_Workers_rights_qn_desc:0 "Normally, when the rights of the working man comes to the attention of governments and legislatures, it comes from the working men themselves demanding better pay, shorter hours, or better working conditions. This time however, it's different. Wales' industry and market is relatively new- at least as its own rather than a subsidiary of a larger economy- and many small, new businesses are struggling to get on their feet.\n\nThey blame labour laws and regulations that were instated upon the founding of the Welsh nation. They argue that they won't be able to keep up with much larger and wealthy foreign nations, and that Welsh finance could perish in its infancy if there isn't action taken, and soon. They want a general rolling back of some regulations- primarily in terms of labor rights and safety regulations- in order to give Welsh companies a leg up. This of course, is a controversial suggestion in Parliament- unspeakable to the left faction of Plaid Cymru..."
WAL_off_with_the_chaff:0 "Scale it down"
WAL_off_with_the_chaff_desc:0 "After what practically amounted to a small war in the parliament, the bruised egos and sullied prides finally gave way to a narrow victory in favor of austerity. While the resistance was spirited and prevented any sort of truly drastic measures from being taken, there are now plans to reduce government spending on its social programs.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to narrow their scope and availability. This will allow Wales to take of those truly in need while not wasting precious resources on those who can probably get by without it. The people will grumble if they must, but they'll have forgotten all about it in a few months' time, and we will reap the benefits."
WAL_Poverty_your_end_is_nye:0 "War on Poverty"
WAL_Poverty_your_end_is_nye_desc:0 "Parliament has, after a great deal of infighting and arguing, finally come to an agreement that leaves everyone in the building perfectly dissatisfied. The social democrats within the parliament managed to get their way, much to the chagrin of the hardliners within Plaid Cymru. Their victory resulted in a resolution to increase spending in order to expand the budget for Wales' various social programs and welfare benefits across the board. These programs have thus far been exceptionally popular, and the people themselves are more than happy to see their tax dollars going to projects like these.\n\nIt doesn't fix the problems previously stated though, and the increased spending still has its critics in parliament- they aren't exactly going to just lie down and shut up now that the battle was lost. It will be worth it to keep an eye on the nation's income and its debt in the coming years to see whether or not the resolution, as popular as it may be, is worth it."
WAL_All_in_on_coal:0 "All in on Coal"
WAL_All_in_on_coal_desc:0 "After fiery debate in parliament, a narrow victory has been achieved, adopting an official policy of going "all in" on the coal industry has won out. While there are concerns about the long-term benefits of this policy, they were largely dismissed when compared to the immediate and tangible benefits that Wales will reap with this policy. In the short term Wales will be able to meet ever-increasing demands for coal exports, allowing Wales to shore up its trade deficit and solve the problems that may arise as they come.\n\nThere's no point in planning for the future if your immediate present isn't secured, after all. Wales will show those naysayers that she is more resilient, as much in financial as she is in military and political strength. Coal is power!"
WAL_diversify_economy:0 "Diversify the Economy"
WAL_diversify_economy_desc:0 "After a long and drawn out debate, the faction of parliament in favor of diversification managed to win out and adopt their stance into official national policy. While it's clear that there's going to need to be some momentary sacrifices as government subsidization and sponsorship of coal mining is reduced to make way for other industries, it's pretty clear that the long term benefits will be worth the cost.\n\nThe math is simple, for while coal might work as the pillar of Welsh industry now, what might the situation look like in five years' time? Ten years? Twenty? Diversification will allow us to remain flexible and adjust as needed in order to keep pace with the world at large. Wales needs to keep with the times if she's to avoid becoming a total economic backwater."
WAL_expand_workers_rights:0 "A Worker's Rights Charter"
WAL_expand_workers_rights_desc:0 "When the businessmen approached Parliament to beg for the rolling back of regulations, they most certainly did not expect the Emyrs Thomas and his faction in the party to use it the way that they did. Rather than allowing doom and gloom of the hypothetical fate of these poor, poor businessmen and capitalists, the social democrats within the party controlled the flow of discussion, and turned it to pointing out the areas in which the current rights and regulations had blind spots or were not strictly defined enough.\n\nThe resulting resolution was the formation of a new Worker's Rights Charter, the exact opposite of the original intent. The charter contains a comprehensive and modernized set of legal and regulatory codes that will make the rights of the Welsh worker clear and easily understood."
WAL_deregulation:0 "Remove Red Tape"
WAL_deregulation_desc:0 "As unfortunate as it might be, the men of commerce do have a point. How can any Welsh business keep up with an American or even an Irish business when they've had decades to establish themselves, whereas the Welsh business only had a matter of years? They have the advantage in resources, in established wealth, and in simple momentum, while the Welsh have nothing in comparison. Welsh businesses need an edge if they're going to be able to compete.\n\nWhen Wales has had a long and successful history of commerce and trade, and our companies and corporations are sitting upon an established, we can think about reinstating those protections. But for now, the unrestrained and unregulated growth will allow those small companies that head start they need, and while the unions may rattle sabers and bang pots together in protest, but they will just need to adjust to the reality of things until such a time that we'll be able to accommodate their desires again."
WAL_address_the_unions:0 "Address the Unions"
WAL_address_the_unions_desc:0 "Being such a small nation with such a large portion of our citizens in heavy labor work, it only makes sense that the local unions wield a much greater deal of power here than it does in other nations. This has been to the benefit of their workers, but it makes half of the parliament nervous, especially when we pass- or even consider- legislation that the unions may not be in favor of. As such, it's common practice to hold a meeting with the unions following a session of parliament, just to be sure.\n\nThis time, the address will be pretty important, given that we passed multiple, very significant pieces of legislation one after the other. It's time to see if the unions are happy with the changes we've made, or if we have earned their ire and will need to find a way to make it up to them, someway, somehow."
WAL_will_our_finances_be_okay:0 "Long-Term Economics"
WAL_will_our_finances_be_okay_desc:0 "Even as the fate of Wales seems more and more incumbent on rancorous parliamentary debates, a good deal of Lewis' policies are still prepped in back rooms. And as he grows older by the day, he may have less and less of a say in what said policies are. Roderic Bowen and Gwynfor Evans, two chief architects of the Welsh economy, have been drafting up discussions to have with PM Lewis. Beyond the public, short-term view of the Assessment, the two men seem to be aiming for a "pragmatic" and stable road to economic growth, the kind that can last for decades. Should the present problems be transcended, these talks will hopefully be remembered as key to a continuously stable Wales."
WAL_military_funding:0 "Military Funding"
WAL_military_funding_desc:0 "While largely undiscussed in the Annual Assessment, the question of military spending deserves to be examined, if not for budgetary concerns than simply to appease Julian Cayo-Evans, always loudly using apocalyptic rhetoric to demand a stronger army. The facts must come before this charged rhetoric, for our brave men are not to be used as pawns in some political game.\n\nLoyal, well-armed, and well-trained, our military nevertheless has gaps. Corruption is rife, and could be solved (depending on who you ask) with more money for better pay, or cuts and investigations to reduce public money in their hands. Such is the general theme of this debate all problems related to the military will be solved by either cutting or boosting its budget, but what are the problems our military exists to solve? To defeat the English? To be a last line of defense in worst-case scenarios? Or perhaps they are the problem, as some leftists and unionists argue."
WAL_talks_with_the_FWA:0 "Hold Talks with the Free Welsh Army"
WAL_talks_with_the_FWA_desc:0 "Its time for a talk. The Free Welsh Army seems to grow ever more brazen by the day, and innocents are both their targets and are getting caught in the crossfire. This is not just horrific in its own right, but it's an affront to the rule of law and our own ability to keep the peace in Wales. Their constant targeting of Englishmen within our borders and without threatens our peace with our neighbors, and it will forever hold back Wales if we don't do something about it.\n\nTo just attack them would lead to open rebellion, and we can hardly afford that when our nation's existence is as of yet, so new. We are unfortunately in no position to make demands either, so we're going to need to negotiate with them. Underneath a banner of truce, we will find out what they want, and what we can offer to get them to stop their military buildup, and to stop their attacks. Evidently, Cayo's appointment wasn't enough, what more could these ingrates want?"
WAL_talks_with_soc_militias:0 "Hold Talks with the Militant Socialists"
WAL_talks_with_soc_militias_desc:0 "It would seem as though our problems with unruly paramilitaries doesn't end with the Free Welsh Army. Recently, there has been an increasingly radicalizing group within our labor force who have adopted various tenets of socialism and are growing increasingly violent as time goes on. If we don't step down to their level and have a conversation, this could get very bloody, very fast.\n\nThe groups are scattered, unorganized, and the movement itself is so intensely grassroots that it's difficult to even find central leaders with whom to talk with. Thankfully, through the cooperation of the Unions, weve been able to identify some useful surrogates who have a pretty good pulse on the overall hopes and feelings of this rising militant population. Let's just hope that they can be reasonable and we can come to an accord without any outbreak of violence."
WAL_do_jack:0 "Wait for all of this to blow over"
WAL_do_jack_desc:0 "The presence of both Emrys Thomas and Julian Cayo-Evans in our cabinet means that any direct action taken against their preferred radicals will alienate them, leading our government to divide and collapse. Party advisors are saying that continuing on a tightrope will only embolden extremists on the ground, but they clearly have never had to sit in a cabinet meeting with both a leftist and a staunch nationalist.\n\nIt is disheartening to hear of things like militant strike waves, aggressive demonstrations, or lynchings in Northern villages. But anger and hatred is like a stick of dynamite, burning and causing damage only temporarily before burning out for good. The efforts of Saunders Lewis and his cabinet to help the Welsh nation are self-evident. A sensible middle ground exists in the vast majority of our citizens, and radical tactics will only further alienate the FWA and the socialists from these moderates. We are a democracy, after all. There is no place for petty score-settling directed by our government. Whatever happens, our brave law enforcement are surely competent enough to deal with the situation. The center will hold, we just won't be enforcing it by the barrel of a gun."
WAL_crackdown_on_FWA:0 "Arrest Cayo's men"
WAL_crackdown_on_FWA_desc:0 "More than anything, the Free Welsh Army is a nationalistic, militaristic blight on our new nation. So as long as we have to tolerate them in our borders, we cannot pretend to be the arbiters of peace and security in our own nation. It's clear that the simple appointment of Julian Cayo-Evans was not enough to keep them in line, so we're going to need to take more drastic measures to curb these terrorists' influence.\n\nSaunders Lewis has prepared an order to police forces all over Wales, complete with a list of suspected and confirmed Free Welsh hideouts, strongholds, and supply depots. A long string of arrests will follow, and after gutting both their ability to organize and crippling their manpower, the Free Welsh will fade into the margins of history books.\n\nWith this order, we can, in one evening, all at once, break the strength of the Free Welsh and secure ourselves as the sole authority in Wales. No doubt, Cayo-Evans will rant and rage about this action, but without the force of an army at his back, what could he do to us?"
WAL_crackdown_on_soc_militias:0 "Disperse Thomas's Rioters"
WAL_crackdown_on_soc_militias_desc:0 "The radical socialists from within the working class of Wales are a different kind of beast entirely, as compared to the Free Welsh Army. While the Free Welsh might be rabid dogs, they are chained rabid dogs, so as long as Julian Cayo-Evans is in our cabinet to make sure that the leash is in fact, held. The Socialists on the other hand, are entirely unfettered, unbound, and free to cause havoc, should they gain the strength to do so. This cannot stand.\n\nDealing with this issue should also help keep the Free Welsh in line, as Julian Cayo-Evans was the first to suggest using police forces to disperse the socialists' rioting. Emrys Thomas is threatening drastic political action if we go through with this plan, but Cayo-Evans in turn assures us that such threats are simple bluster, and that he can do little and less if his precious rioters were to be scattered to the wind. We hope he's right."
WAL_education_reforms:0 "Educational Matters"
WAL_education_reforms_desc:0 "Out of all of the duties and responsibilities of a nation, the one we have neglected most in the early life of our nation has been educating the youth. At the time, it was understandable that we'd want to work to first establish a parliament, police forces, armed forces, and regulations on businesses and unions. But now we have established ourselves, and we need to revisit our scattered, inconsistent national education system.\n\nSome localities and provinces are simply handling education themselves, with a smattering of private schools in some of the richer regions of Wales complicating the picture even more. The simple disorganization has caused problems, with educational standards in one part of Wales exceeding or being drastically beneath that of another part of Wales. We need to start coralling these local public schools and private institutions and start installing some kind of regulations, or even state control of these institutions, if necessary."
WAL_next_gen_teachers:0 "The Next Generation of Teachers"
WAL_next_gen_teachers_desc:0 "We have something of a unique problem. While we are in the midst of reforming and organizing our education system, we have run into the issue of our educators. The vast majority of them are English- many of whom are exiles from the collaborationist regime in England- and they are often very old besides. Most of them are set in their ways, and if we are going to breathe new life into Welsh education, we need to first inject fresh blood into the educational staff.\n\nThey need to be Welsh-born, or at least well-assimilated, and similarly need to be well-versed in the Welsh tongue. We can start up a training and teaching program, recruiting many of those old English professors and teachers to pass on the torch to the next generation of Welsh educators, and in turn, be integral in the birth of a new educational tradition in the nation of Wales itself, one that should guarantee the lasting impact and strength of our culture."
WAL_lessons_from_chubut:0 "Lessons From Chubut"
WAL_lessons_from_chubut_desc:0 "Welsh, as a language, is going stronger than it has since the high middle ages. However, the language isn't really the same language that we spoke back then either, as centuries of English domination has introduced a lot of English into the language that would otherwise not be there. But this isn't the case for everywhere Welsh is spoken, because it has come to our attention that in the most unlikely of places... Argentina.\n\nGaiman, Trelew and Trevelin are Welsh-descended villages in the Chubut Province of Argentina and the last remnants of Y Wladychfa Gymreig. Unlike Wales, they have not experienced centuries of English control, and they have not been under as firm supervision of the Spanish-speaking Argentine government as we were underneath the English. We should send some scholars to Argentina to study the language, how it differs from our own, and figure out how they managed to preserve the tongue so effectively in spite of the intervening centuries."
WAL_standardized_testing:0 "National Grading"
WAL_standardized_testing_desc:0 "With our control over the public education system and our influence in the private schools secured, the last remaining incoherency in the Welsh educational system is how we grade students. There are a few different ideas that different provinces and schools have introduced, but it seems as though everyone agrees that we just need to stick with one, as the confusion has brought region and time of education into question for colleges and employers alike.\n\nThe process is simple, we'll just take the different ideas, everything from percentile grading, to grading on a 20, to grading on a 100, to pass and fail versus letter grading, and determine which serves Wales the best. Every version has its supporters, but is surprisingly non-partisan in who supports which."
WAL_A_Bright_Future:0 "A Bright Future"
WAL_A_Bright_Future_desc:0 "Wales was not a nation born in glorious revolution or mighty conquest, but by accident for all intents and purposes. The nation that Saunders Lewis inherited was factitious, with violent revolution and aggrieved paramilitaries threatening her very existence. It was a nation with a fragile, small, and weak economy, a suspect military, a fractured parliament, and no international standing. By all accounts, Wales should not stand today, and yet here we are. By all accounts, the Welsh tongue and culture should be dead, and yet here we are. By all accounts, Wales should be a puppet of a foreign power, or a rump state otherwise, and yet here we stand.\n\nSaunders Lewis was not the kind of man that would normally have statues made of him, but he has proven to be exactly the unifying figure that this young nation needed. Through his leadership and decisive action, Wales has weathered the storm and defied all expectations. Though we do not know what the future will bring, the citizens of the newly reformed and rejuvenated Wales can rest easy knowing that we have proven our ability to stand tall and proud amidst tribulation."

WAL_Mine_Rumors:0 "Rumours from the Mines"
WAL_Mine_Rumors_desc:0 "From the depths of the coal mines, several worrying rumors have surfaced. The miners claim that the coal in some mines is starting to run out after years of intensive mining. If these reports turn out to be true they will forecast an end of the coal industry and a greater impending disaster.\n\nA collapse of coal could cause a chain reaction which would have devastating consequences, including the collapse of the welsh economy.

WAL_Coal_Investigation:0 "Investigate the Mines"
WAL_Coal_Investigation_desc:0 "With the rise of the recent news from the mines, we must investigate for ourselves. Put simply the government just wishes not to believe the miners. These rumors are preposterous, but, if true, the situation that would follow would be very serious indeed.\n\nSo we shall see for ourselves the validity of their claims, we will suspend our disbelief and start an investigation. Soon these fears will be put to an end and we can move on with more important matters. Surely the miners cannot be right."
WAL_Cover_Up:0 "Cover Up the Findings"
WAL_Cover_Up_desc:0 "Plaid cymru has many opponents, who would be keen to destabilize our government through any way they can. If they were to learn of the findings of our investigation they would publish it in every paper, broadcast to every radio and sow discontent throughout Wales. Which would lead to considerable hostility towards our party amongst the people.\n\nA large scale cover up will have to be undertaken to prevent this. The media must not find out. They will not undermine us."
WAL_Burn_The_Report:0 "Burn the Report"
WAL_Burn_The_Report_desc:0 "We were wrong\n\nThe situation is worse than we could have possibly imagined. The investigation has started to send back reports that confirm all of the miners' suspicions, we are running out of coal. If the reports were to spread, confidence in the government would dissolve, guaranteeing the end of our leadership of wales. We must not and will not allow this.\n\nEvery single report from the mines will be disposed of promptly. Reduced to ashes, never to be brought to the public."

We will deny everything and hide what we can from them.\n\nIf it is good enough for President Nixon it is good enough for us. We did nothing wrong and nothing will go wrong."
WAL_Keep_Calm_and_Carry_on:0 "Keep Calm and Carry On"
WAL_Keep_Calm_and_Carry_on_desc:0 "After all our efforts it seems the worst of our fears have passed. Finally we can start to turn our attention away from coal and onto more ordinary matters.\n\nElsewhere others carry on free of the knowledge we have kept from them. Miners have returned to the depths, journalists remain unaware and the rest of the public is none the wiser of the catastrophe that we have avoided.\n\nLife has continued and all is calm."

WAL_Out_of_the_frying_pan_and_in_to_the_fire_desc:0 "Having to receive the news of the dwindling production of coal was bad, the ensuing cover up was rough as well. Chaos took hold over the government, as smoke rose from fires that were fueled by the reports, whose number had already been overstated. Silence was bought, every miner was eyed with suspicion.\n\nYet it has still gotten worse.\n\nSomehow the reports have been leaked, soon all of Wales will know of the impending coal catastrophe and, more worryingly, the extent of our cover up. Our efforts have failed, may we be spared and allowed to survive what is to come."
WAL_Whitewash_Saunders:0 "Whitewash Saunders"
WAL_Whitewash_Saunders_desc:0 "Our party has already started to be embroiled in the political disaster that has followed the leak of one of our documents. If we are to find a way to survive we must find a way to downplay Saunders' role in the coverup. It is the only conceivable way to restore any form of public trust in Plaid.\n\nThe Prime Minister will be put through a blitz of talks with the press in order to gloss over any part that he may or may not have played in the crisis. With Saunders out of the turmoil we can start to hope that one day the people of Wales will forgive the rest of the party."
WAL_Accuse_Thomas:0 "Accuse Thomas"
WAL_Accuse_Thomas_desc:0 "Emrys Thomas has long been an accomplished minister of our party, he has been an ever greater friend to many of our members. But for the sake of the party that he has loved and helped build he will have to lower his head.\n\nThis is a sacrifice no one in the government wishes to force Thomas to make, yet it will be necessary to prevent pinning the blame on any other faction and causing more political turmoil. So we will regrettably have to accuse Thomas of the cover up to try and save the parties chances of clinging on to power."
WAL_Implicate_Evans:0 "Implicate Evans"
WAL_Implicate_Evans_desc:0 "Evans and the other socialist in the government are to blame for the crisis which they have exacerbated. We will reveal to the people that it was in fact Evans and his lackeys within the trade unions that tried to cover up the fact that the coal mines of Wales were depleted.\n\nImplecating Evans into the cover up will help clear the other members of our party that were involved. We risk exacerbating the crisis with more political infighting, but it is a risk we will have to take to survive."
WAL_blame_the_Cayo_Clique:0 "Blame the Cayo Clique"
WAL_blame_the_Cayo_Clique_desc:0 "A crisis as severe as this could have only been aggravated by a band of destructive agitators. Cayo and the rest of his clique would make the perfect culprits for the scandal. They are already known to be potential troublemakers, trying to weaken the government through creating such an emergency would not seem too far fetched.\n\nCayo will have the blame affixed to him, thus preserving what remains of the public's confidence in our party."
WAL_Answer_to_the_assembly:0 "Answer to the Assembly"
WAL_Answer_to_the_assembly_desc:0 "As the crisis has gone on our position within the assembly has deteriorated, all of our former allies have stabbed us in the back, leaving us politically isolated. It will soon be impossible for us to continue leading Wales.\n\nWe are obliged to answer to the assembly and its ministers. They will be told of the situation and the events that followed. The fate of our government will soon be decided by the rest of the assembly."
WAL_Answer_to_the_Public:0 "Answer to the Public"
WAL_Answer_to_the_Public_desc:0 "No matter how hard we might try we will simply never be able shift all of the blame from our party. As this crisis and its subsequent cover up happened on our watch we will be the ones that will have to answer to the public.\n\nIt will not be easy. Much embarrassment is certain to be caused as a result of the questioning but we must try to make up for the faults of the past, in the hopes of satisfying the people. Maybe there is a chance that we can still claw back some credibility."
WAL_Vote_Of_No_Confidence:0 "A Vote of No Confidence"
WAL_Vote_Of_No_Confidence_desc:0 "We have failed Wales.\n\nOur efforts to appease the public have seen limited success at best and the assembly has united against us. There is only so long that we can carry on in this position, soon we will have to swallow our pride and face a vote of no confidence. A vote few expected us to survive. Nevertheless we will have to allow ourselves to be held accountable.\n\nWe will have to hope that the people of Wales will be more forgiving."
WAL_Back_To_Business:0 "Back to Business"
WAL_Back_To_Business_desc:0 "Plaid has done it again! We have yet again managed to overcome what seemed to be an unimaginable obstacle. Many days and weeks have passed since we found out about the shortage of coal and still there are no reports to be seen.\n\nTo the public the coal crisis simply does not exist.\n\nNow that everything is dealt with, Wales is back. We can return to business as usual and continue leading Wales towards its future."

 WAL_Goch1_Goch_Victory:0 "Goch Victory!"
 WAL_Goch1_Goch_Victory_desc:0 "The workers of Wales have spoken, and their wish is clear - idealism, socialism, democracy! The uncaring and distant capitalists of Plaid Cymru and the unionist Tory traitors have lost their sway, their lies and corruption exposed for all to see. Cymru Goch, once but a splinter faction of the Plaid, has now been entrusted with a goal most noble - restoration of the Welshmen's faith in their own government and the establishment of democratic socialism in Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_Political_Reform:0 "Political Reform"
 WAL_Goch1_Political_Reform_desc:0 "The previous government's administration has left behind a legacy of authoritarianism and repression - things we cannot, and will not, tolerate. Sweeping reforms in the political sphere are required in order to ensure the stability and prosperity of our Republic."
 WAL_Goch1_Promote_Welsh_Democracy:0 "A Fair Democracy"
 WAL_Goch1_Promote_Welsh_Democracy_desc:0 "Our young nation was built on the virtues of democracy and political plurality, virtues that are worth protecting. While we do not agree with the capitalists, reactionaries and unionists that exist in our society, they are still citizens of Wales, members of our democratic society. Our common values must be promoted and protected."
 WAL_Goch1_Keep_The_Scum_Out:0 "Keep the Scum Out"
 WAL_Goch1_Keep_The_Scum_Out_desc:0 "There are some, however, who do not respect our democratic way of governance, and would seek to destroy and replace it with a dictatorship. These dangerous organizations and people, however fringe in their beliefs, cannot be tolerated. While some will cry and moan about the supposed "breach of free speech and assembly laws" they will, in time, understand our decision."
 WAL_Goch1_Endorse_Leftist_Parties:0 "Endorse Leftist Parties"
 WAL_Goch1_Endorse_Leftist_Parties_desc:0 "Great injustices were made in previous years concerning the treatment of our fellow socialists and other leftists, all in the name of "ensuring stability" and "fighting the red menace". These explanations are ridiculous, of course, and are simply excuses for the power-hungry oligarchs to silence their enemies. Now, as the tables have turned, so has the government's stance towards leftism. Our comrades must be supported and endorsed, so that the workers have their representation in politics!"
 WAL_Goch1_Deal_With_Julians_Fanatics:0 "Deal with Julian's Fanatics"
 WAL_Goch1_Deal_With_Julians_Fanatics_desc:0 "Cayo-Evans and his band of fanatic terrorists are the greatest internal danger to our democracy, eclipsed only by the accursed fascists surrounding us. They must be dealt with quickly and decisively lest they try to oppose us directly."
 WAL_Goch1_Media_Representation:0 "Media Representation"
 WAL_Goch1_Media_Representation_desc:0 "The media in our country were always loyal to the establishment, protecting and downplaying the failures of Plaid Cymru. This cannot continue. Pluralism in the media must be guaranteed and other parties must be allowed to be in the spotlight. The old guard won't be too keen on this idea, however, and problems are almost guaranteed to arise."
 WAL_Goch1_Civic_Nationalism:0 "Civic Nationalism"
 WAL_Goch1_Civic_Nationalism_desc:0 "The newly-achieved independence of our country has led to a drastic increase of ethnic nationalism, most visibly expressed in the form of the Free Welsh Army. While we love our land and treasure its independence, we believe that it belongs to all of our countrymen, not just those who are ethnically and linguistically Welsh. Love for Wales must be based on a set of shared values and loyalty to our democratic institutions, not blind ethnonationalism."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Democracy:0 "Welsh Democracy"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Democracy_desc:0 "Our political reforms have paid off! Welsh democracy is stronger and healthier than ever before, pluralism and freedom are legally guaranteed and defended, and political discourse is remarkably and surprisingly civil. Our work is not done yet, however! The questions of the economy and society remain."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Gears_Of_Change:0 "The Gears of Change"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Gears_Of_Change_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, Wales was a relative backwater in the economical sphere. Great progress was made during the industrial revolution, but the cost of said progress was great - the common worker was left mostly destitute, and although the situation improved near the turn of the century, Plaid Cymru's capitalist ways have kept the people of Wales from achieving true prosperity. Not anymore. The workers will be protected, and Wales will prosper."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Resources:0 "Welsh Resources"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Resources_desc:0 "Our land is blessed with bountiful quantities of various resources, many of which are the mainstays of an industrialized economy. Extraction of these resources gives our nation a position otherwise impossible to achieve for a country of our size, but there are many deposits which have not been touched by human hands. Finally extracting these riches will help our economy immensely."
 WAL_Goch1_Heavy_Industry:0 "Heavy Industry"
 WAL_Goch1_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization in the 19th and early 20th centuries led to a population boom and a staggering increase in wealth, but it was distributed unequally, and many regions of Wales, especially in the northern and eastern reaches of the country are predominantly rural and poor. Establishing new industrial centers will help realize our true potential."
 WAL_Goch1_Digging_Out_More_Coal:0 "Digging Out More Coal"
 WAL_Goch1_Digging_Out_More_Coal_desc:0 "Coal is Wales's life and death, a source of employment for many, and a cause of death for many others, be it from the pollution it produces or calamities like the Aberfan Disaster. As much as we would prefer to use cleaner and more efficient resources, it is the most economically viable right now, and if we wish to expand the economy, we have to expand the coal mines as well. Proper health and safety regulation should take care of most of the risks, shouldn't it? Who knows, maybe someday we'll have better alternatives..."
 WAL_Goch1_Bigger_Steelmills:0 "Bigger Steelmills"
 WAL_Goch1_Bigger_Steelmills_desc:0 "Steel is arguably the most important resource in the world, used for everything from kitchen utensils through buildings up to tanks, cars and airplanes. Thankfully, our rich coal and iron reserves allow us to produce great quantities of it. All we need now is an expansion of our existing and the building of new steel mills."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Welsh_Stamp_Of_Approval:0 "The Welsh Stamp of Approval"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Welsh_Stamp_Of_Approval_desc:0 "Since we lack the cheap workforce and sheer size of countries such as Germany or the USA, we cannot prioritize quantity over quality. Instead, we must focus on producing only the finest of goods and materials in order to secure a spot in the international market - and for that, we need strict quality assurance."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Welfare:0 "Welsh Welfare"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Welfare_desc:0 "The trap which many capitalist economies fall into is one of growth for the sake of growth, economic progress benefiting only the strong and rich while leaving behind the toilers who make said progress possible. This happened in Wales too, but it will continue no longer. Better wages, regulations and improved working conditions will make for just recompense for the hard work of our people."
 WAL_Goch1_Reverse_Previous_Restrictions:0 "Reverse Previous Restrictions"
 WAL_Goch1_Reverse_Previous_Restrictions_desc:0 "The Plaid Cymru was founded on the noble ideas of democracy and freedom for the people of Wales, but they failed to uphold them after we regained our long-awaited independence. Their ways became more and more authoritarian, and plain disregard for the will and desires of the people could be seen. Restrictions were placed upon Welsh political life, ones that spit in the face of the ideals upon which our nation was founded. They must be reversed, so that freedom, true freedom, may return to Wales."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Broadcasting_Channel:0 "Welsh Broadcasting Channel"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Broadcasting_Channel_desc:0 "The modern inventions of television and radio have a relatively small community of users in our country, with newspapers being the primary source of news for the common Welshman. Many people, however, have no *good* source of news, relying on sensationalized tabloid-like publications. To remedy this, we need to create a state-owned, free-to-air broadcasting channel, filled with only the freshest news and best entertainment."
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Workers_Protection_Bill:0 "Welsh Working Protection Bill"
 WAL_Goch1_Welsh_Workers_Protection_Bill_desc:0 "Our government has, after many discussions, consultations and opinion surveys drafted the Welsh Worker's Protection Bill, which will guarantee and expand the rights and privileges of the working class of Wales. While an official proposition of the WWPB is sure to start a lively debate in the Assembly and attract criticism from the Plaid Cymru, it simply must be done, for it will serve as a major step-stone in the struggle for workers' rights in Wales."
 WAL_Goch1_Ending_Working_Toil:0 "Ending Working Toil"
 WAL_Goch1_Ending_Working_Toil_desc:0 "Previous Labour Commission reports, especially during the Plaid Cymru's period of dominance, have painted a grim picture of Welsh working conditions. Labourers were found to be suffering from back pain, light and heavy injuries and other physical ailments caused by overworking and insufficient safety regulations, not to mention the psychological effects of toxic and unsafe working environments. This year will see another report being submitted to the government - may it be the best one yet."
 WAL_Goch1_Wonder_Working_Wales:0 "Wonder-Working Wales"
 WAL_Goch1_Wonder_Working_Wales_desc:0 "Our economy is stronger than ever! Production is skyrocketing, new businesses are opening everywhere, our population is increasing... and all without any crony capitalism! The people are wealthy and happy, slowly forgetting about the tribulations of years past. Already, a new nickname has stuck to our country, and is gaining more and more popularity around the world - Wonder Working Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_A_New_Face_To_The_World:0 "A New Face to the World"
 WAL_Goch1_A_New_Face_To_The_World_desc:0 "Wales, for nearly all of its history, has been a politically insignificant nation. Subjugated by the Romans and later by the Britons, our standing in politics has been one of a vassal, always at a disadvantage. Even after the restoration of our independence following the Second World War, our status was low, and no measures were taken to change that. Now, however, with the situation at home getting better and better every single day, we can turn our gaze outwards and use our domestic successes to achieve our goals in the field of international politics."
 WAL_Goch1_Keeping_Halder_Content:0 "Keeping Halder Content"
 WAL_Goch1_Keeping_Halder_Content_desc:0 "After the shameful defeat Great Britain suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany, the accursed fascists installed a military garrison in Cornwall in order to better oversee the situation in their rotting puppet, the Kingdom of England. While we hold nothing but contempt for the fascist murderers and oppressors and would like to see their complete removal from the Isles, considering the circumstances, we must abide by the principles of Realpolitik. A diplomatic mission must be sent to the garrison commander, Franz Halder, to ensure him of our good intentions towards Germany. A lie, of course, but a necessary one."
 WAL_Goch1_Ignore_Scottish_Complaints:0 "Ignore Scottish Complaints"
 WAL_Goch1_Ignore_Scottish_Complaints_desc:0 "As expected, the Scots aren't too thrilled about us reaffirming our relations with Germany. Their government has issued an official diplomatic protest against our actions, barely stopping short of calling us fascist collaborators. As much as we regret having to make that decision, we stand by it, and for that, the protest must be ignored. Sometimes, silence is the better option."
 WAL_Goch1_Throw_Out_Local_Complaints:0 "Throw Out Local Complaints"
 WAL_Goch1_Throw_Out_Local_Complaints_desc:0 "An even worse situation has arisen. Although we could simply ignore the Scots, we cannot ignore the cries and criticisms of our people, especially if they are morally justified. Sadly, there is no place for morals in dealing with the Germans, and our citizens must accept that fact.\n\nKeep the repression minimal."
 WAL_Goch1_Antagonize_The_English:0 "Antagonize the English"
 WAL_Goch1_Antagonize_The_English_desc:0 "The English to the East have long oppressed our nation, conquering and exploiting it for their own imperialist gains. Their mismanagement and ill will have cost us much and kept us behind in development - in all spheres. There can be no friendship between us."
 WAL_Goch1_Across_The_Irish_Sea:0 "Across the Irish Sea"
 WAL_Goch1_Across_The_Irish_Sea_desc:0 "Ireland, our Celtic brother-nation, has experienced a story much like our own - one of subjugation, mistreatment and oppression at the hands of the dastardly English. Now, it presents a golden opportunity - trade and cooperation across the sea! International friendship and cold, hard capital await!"
 WAL_Goch1_Our_Trade_Partner:0 "Our Trade Partner"
 WAL_Goch1_Our_Trade_Partner_desc:0 "Germany is a monster devouring Europe and leaving it to rot in its innards, the antithesis to all we hold dear and sacred... and yet, we find ourselves at its mercy. The German economy, however weakened, is a behemoth towering over us, one which could squash us beneath its feet if it wanted to. The only reasonable course of action at the moment is economical cooperation and appeasement, lest we find ourselves fighting a financial war we cannot win."
 WAL_Goch1_The_Dragon_Emerges:0 "The Dragon Emerges"
 WAL_Goch1_The_Dragon_Emerges_desc:0 "With renewing, improving and strengthening our international relations in the region we have secured a safe, solid place for Wales on the political scene. New friends were made, threats neutralized and attitudes clarified. We no longer have to fear for what tomorrow may bring, for only an unprecedented cataclysm could shake up the accords and treaties signed!"
 WAL_Goch1_Cymru_Am_Byth:0 "Cymru Am Byth"
 WAL_Goch1_Cymru_Am_Byth_desc:0 "Our time as the government of Wales will be forever remembered as one of the bright points in our nation's history! The people are wealthier, happier and safer than ever, our economy is booming, our international position is safe and secure, and our democracy serves as a beacon of hope on a continent strangleheld by fascism! The proud people of Cymru have shown their mettle once again and proven that nothing can break the spirits of Welshmen!\n\nCymru am Byth!"
 WAL_Goch1_Look_At_Coal:0 "A Second Look At Coal"
 WAL_Goch1_Look_At_Coal_desc:0 "Our coal reserve is the most important feature of our economy and one of the few reasons for our economic significance. In past years, its extraction was performed without regard for the health and wellbeing of our workers and environment. Now, however, we must take a second look at the issue in order to guarantee ethical and sustainable coal extraction."
 WAL_Goch1_Above_the_Hills:0 "Above the Hills"
 WAL_Goch1_Above_the_Hills_desc:0 "The working conditions of miners have gone a long way from the frequent cave-ins, explosions, overworking and injuries characteristic of the XIXth Century, but they are still quite poor. As part of the Coal Plan, we have drafted a massive campaign of reform across the mining sector, improving safety, pay, efficiency and access to medical care. Implementing these ideas will not be cheap, quick or easy, but the long-term benefits will be immense."
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_the_Unions:0 "Convincing the Unions"
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_the_Unions_desc:0 "Our government has long supported the trade unions of our country, increasing their rights and privileges in accordance to our sincerest beliefs. Through these efforts, we have built up significant goodwill with them, and now is the time to capitalize on it. What good is our Coal Plan if the workers do not consent?"
 WAL_Goch1_Offer_More_Steel:0 "Offering more Steelworks"
 WAL_Goch1_Offer_More_Steel_desc:0 "Despite our radical improvement of safety in the mining sector, coal mines continue to be dangerous (mostly due to coalbed methane) and taxing working environments, both physically and mentally. In order to provide employment for workers unsuitable for mining and increase steel production, the Ministry of Economy has prepared a steelworks expansion plan, the main objective of which is the building of new steel mills and the modernization and expansion of existing ones. All we need now is a green light from the Prime Minister."
 WAL_Goch1_No_Worker_Suffer:0 "No Worker Will Suffer"
 WAL_Goch1_No_Worker_Suffer_desc:0 "The struggle for better working conditions never ends. Great strides have been made during our term, but there is still a lot of room for improvement, namely - the expansion of welfare and improved safety regulations. We progress more and more towards the establishment of a Welsh Safety Net!"
 WAL_Goch1_Increasing_Taxes:0 "Increasing Taxes"
 WAL_Goch1_Increasing_Taxes_desc:0 "As expected, our reforms have put a strain on our budget, and we are getting dangerously close to insolvency. This situation has laid bare the insufficiency of our current tax rates and shown us the necessity of increasing them. Such an action will hurt our people, especially those of the upper class, but in time they will understand that a society of solidarity requires sacrifices."
 WAL_Goch1_Sheep:0 "Sheep in the Valleys"
 WAL_Goch1_Sheep_desc:0 "As a party of urban workers, we have focused our platform on the betterment of their situation. The attention we gave to the industrialized and mining-dependent regions of our country has sadly marginalized our agricultural sector and alienated many farmers. Such a move was a terrible mistake, one we must - and will - remedy."
 WAL_Goch1_Forgotten_Regions:0 "Focus on Forgotten Regions"
 WAL_Goch1_Forgotten_Regions_desc:0 "Our country, although small, sports disparities in development reminiscent of far larger nations. Many regions lag behind, mostly due to governmental failures. We must shift our focus to these regions, directing both public and private investment and building up infrastructure."
 WAL_Goch1_Agriculture_Exports:0 "Agricultural Exports"
 WAL_Goch1_Agriculture_Exports_desc:0 "Our agricultural output has increased to the point of a surplus! Money from exporting this surplus is already filling our coffers, money we can invest into further developing our country. The economy has been successfully diversified, and we are no longer totally dependent on coal and steel!"
 WAL_Goch1_Sustainable_Economy:0 "A Sustainable Economy"
 WAL_Goch1_Sustainable_Economy_desc:0 "No longer are we at the mercy of mining! While far from total autarky, our economy is now strong enough to stand at its own feet, with exports steadily increasing and imports of basic goods dropping dramatically. There is still a lot to be done, but what we have created has grown to be a diverse, strong, and healthy economy."
 WAL_Goch1_Assuage_Union_Fears:0 "Assuage Union Fears"
 WAL_Goch1_Assuage_Union_Fears_desc:0 "The Aberfan disaster traumatized our nation and prejudiced it against coal mining, and the unions are no exception. Memory of the innocents who perished that terrible morning still burns bright in the memory of unionized workers, and a lot of work will be required to calm their fears of another Aberfan - work we are willing to do."
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_Parliament:0 "Convincing Parliament"
 WAL_Goch1_Convince_Parliament_desc:0 "With the workers on our side, all that is left now is persuading the Assembly to support our plan. Easier said than done. While we can (mostly) count on the votes of the left, the Plaid Cymru is likely to oppose us. However, we are certain that they will fold, in time. Nobody wants to be remembered as "the man who brought about the second Aberfan" after all."
 WAL_Goch1_Threaten_Nonbelievers:0 "Threaten the Non-Believers"
 WAL_Goch1_Threaten_Nonbelievers_desc:0 "It seems the task at hand is too difficult to complete through diplomacy alone, for some of our party members have broken ranks and are planning to vote against our Plan. They have their reasons, no doubt, but we cannot tolerate such dissident behavior in the Cymru Goch, not when so much is at stake. We will give them a simple choice - vote in accordance with party lines, or say goodbye to their posts."
 WAL_Goch1_No_Voice_Behind:0 "No Voice Left Behind"
 WAL_Goch1_No_Voice_Behind_desc:0 "While we could threaten the dissidents to bring them back behind party lines by force, such a solution would be undemocratic and counterproductive. Instead, we should start a unity campaign, calling for all Welsh patriots in the Assembly to support the Plan. This would not only spare us from in-party conflict, but also build long-lasting parliamentary support."
 WAL_Goch1_A_United_Left:0 "A United Left?"
 WAL_Goch1_A_United_Left_desc:0 "For the first time in Welsh history, the parliamentary left is strong and united! Our representatives, supported by smaller leftist groups, have achieved a majority strong enough to pass the Coal Plan and secure a future of safe, sustainable coal mining in Wales!"
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Election:0 "Preparing for the Election"
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Election_desc:0 "With the economical campaign over, the political campaign begins. The tools of this trade aren't hammers and sickles, but posters and leaflets. The workplaces are not factories and farms, but party offices, meeting halls and the streets themselves! Let every Welshman know what the government has done for him!"
 WAL_Goch1_Restore_Diplomatic_Reputation:0 "Restoring our Diplomatic Reputation"
 WAL_Goch1_Restore_Diplomatic_Reputation_desc:0 "Ever since our independence, we were alone, closed off from allies, surrounded by wolves waiting for a moment of weakness. We kept to ourselves, and expected others to follow suit. This is no way to conduct a modern diplomatic policy! We must reach out to our neighbors and potential friends from across the sea, lest we die alone and forgotten."
 WAL_Goch1_Looking_Overseas:0 "Looking Overseas"
 WAL_Goch1_Looking_Overseas_desc:0 "The lands overseas house some of the last holdouts of freedom and democracy in the world. Waiting, gathering their strength, they look for opportunities to strike against fascism. That is how they're portrayed in OFN propaganda, at least. We have no delusions, we know that life in the "free world" isn't free of discrimination, poverty or violence - but we have no one else to turn to."
 WAL_Goch1_Remembering_Empire:0 "Remembering the Empire"
 WAL_Goch1_Remembering_Empire_desc:0 "What has the Empire ever done for us? All it has done is exploit our people, all in the name of a monarch descendant from the royals of old who led their armies against us. Now, however, with the Empire gone, we can establish diplomatic relations with its former dominions - this time, as equals."
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Mission:0 "A Mission to the USA"
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Mission_desc:0 "Ever since the second World War, the United States have taken upon itself the mantle of the leader of the free world. It is a peculiar free world, especially considering the discrimination of blacks or their support for terrorists and authoritarians, but their commitment to fighting fascism is unquestionable. Cordial diplomatic relations with the world's most powerful democracy would serve us well."
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Weapons:0 "Request American Gun Designs"
 WAL_Goch1_USA_Weapons_desc:0 "The ever-expanding American military-industrial complex, despite its liking for proxy wars and overpriced products, does produce some of the finest military equipment in the world. Using our newly-acquired goodwill with the Americans, we could request the transfer of some of their designs to use for domestic production. None of it will be cutting-edge, but it might be useful for upgrading our aging equipment."
 WAL_Goch1_On_The_Isles:0 "On the Isles"
 WAL_Goch1_On_The_Isles_desc:0 "The most important step is interacting with those the closest to us, for they may be our best allies - or our worst foes. We cannot know which are which unless we establish relations with them."
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Scotland:0 "Talks with Scotland"
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Scotland_desc:0 "Scotland is our brother, a beacon of democracy on an island drowned in fascism. We share common interests, namely - defence against the Germans and the British and the preservation of democracy, which should make negotiations easy.\n\nShould."
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Ireland:0 "Talks with Ireland"
 WAL_Goch1_Talks_With_Ireland_desc:0 "Ireland, a fellow Celtic nation, has long suffered under the yoke of the British. Partnership with us is in their best interest. Sadly, their past association with the Germans and the Fianna Fáil's similarity to the Plaid Cymru may cast a shadow on negotiations.\n\nMay."
 WAL_Goch1_Watching_Border:0 "Watching the Border"
 WAL_Goch1_Watching_Border_desc:0 "The English have emerged from their Civil War a stronger nation, and it would be foolish to assume their stance towards us is anything but hostile. It would seem that imperialist habits die hard, and yet another subjugation would be disastrous to our people. A surprise attack would spell the end of our independence. We must watch the Marches."
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Worst:0 "Preparing for the Worst"
 WAL_Goch1_Preparing_Worst_desc:0 "Relations have been secured, our army improved with the help of the Americans, and the Marches garrisoned.

In short, those Anglophiles and Communists thought there would be no consequences for their dereliction of duty. All they ended up doing was waking the dragon.\n\nWith the politicians rounded up and the FWA awaiting orders from Prime Minister Cayo, the ground is prepared for a cultural offensive against Anglicization in all its nefarious forms.

From the pubs of Cardiff to the smallest dance halls in the northern villages, we must ensure that any suspected Unionist is reported to the authorities, so that we may reinstill within them the true values of Wales. For the few foolish enough to continue resistance against this surging tide, our most loyal soldiers await within newly established detention centers.\n\nIn decades, when our freedom is untouchable and we stand as a shining beacon of what a truly proud nation can achieve, the poisonous beliefs of the Unionists will be historical footnotes.

Those still clinging to English liberal thought, of course, have no place in a proud society, let alone its guiding party. Various leaders of these sects with Plaid have already been...marked.\n\nWhile some fifth-columnists are rumored to have called our plan a way of weakening a precarious position, they are simply fearful of what is coming their way. Yes, Plaid will be disorganized in some areas for a brief period, but this will simply mean that truer defenders of Wales, ones not incumbent on suited bureaucrats to carry out their will, can implement Cayo's program.

We must do away with them if we are to make any progress.\n\nThis process will be twofold: undoing the slave mentality their lies have imposed upon our once indomitable culture, and removing any ability of theirs to poison the Welsh mind. No more shall our children be taught by limp-wristed cowards, no more shall our workers be betrayed by Unionist scum.

If they desire to live separately from us, so be it. They will have no right to complain if they suddenly find the desire to move over to the prosperous Welsh regions once declared beneath them.\n\nBuilding on this, our advisors also point to evidence of increased criminality among the Anglos, along with less desire to work, and more support for communism. This is all scientifically proven, and makes one ask why the backwards Lewis government ever believed these two groups could function side-by-side. Let them run their own inept education and law enforcement, we shall have no part in it. This, they argue, is a path to true equality, a separation of cultures based on how they desire to live.

We also aim to implement a system of passes required for their free movement, in order to fight trans-metropolitan crime.

He has chosen to form the Welsh National Assembly, a body with the power to pass laws, albeit with the Y Mab Darogan having the right of veto.

Unlike neighboring England, the Germans have no direct influence over Welsh politics, with the Welsh people content to be completely neutral.\n\nThis neutrality comes at a cost however, Welsh coal, the country's main export and the only thing keeping Germany at bay. It was largely due to this neutrality and their export focused economy that Wales was able to ride out the economic crash of the 1950s that crippled Germany.\n\nDespite this lack of outsider influence, Welsh politics have become increasingly polarized over the previous decade and a half, in no small part due to the multitudinous English refugees who fled the German invasion, with the country split between those who look back fondly to the days when England and Wales were unified and those who believe that Wales should stay Welsh."

The MPs have arrived, the speeches have been given and, behind closed doors, the battle for the future of Wales is about to begin. As battles go, this one isn't that much more civil than most.\n\nWales' internal political situation is... complicated to say the least. The current ruling party is Plaid Cymru leading a coalition of left and right wing nationalists, including Cymru Goch, democratic socialists and the second largest party in the nation. The coalition is only barely held together with many elements holding opposing views.\n\nTheir ranks bolstered by the numerous English Refugees that fled the German Army during Operation Sealion are the Unionists, named after and characterised by their desire to return to a United Kingdom with England as well as their wish to suppress Welsh culture in favour of English language and culture. They are also well known for their general disinterest in any government issues that do not affect them or England, preferring to stay on the sidelines in the Welsh National Assembly.\n\nThen there is the Free Wales Army. Led by Julian Cayo-Evans, this right-wing nationalistic paramilitary organisation vehemently opposes the Unionists and any idea of a union with England, viewing the English as the "true enemies of the Welsh people". Part of the coalition, they are notorious for their violent methods and clashes with Unionists and for their willingness to go to any lengths to achieve their goals. Despite being publicly perceived as merely a young, inexperienced and quite unstable leader, Cayo-Evans is determined to keep Wales Welsh and his charismatic personality and the fantical devotion and military might of the FWA mean he is not to be trifled with or dismissed without consequence."

The agricultural sector is shrinking but the growth in the coal mining industry well makes up for that. As you well know, coal mining is by far the largest industry in the economy, providing the vast majority of the jobs in the country. There have been calls to decrease our economy's reliance on coal and to open up the economy for new industries."\n\n"And what do the mining firms think of that idea?"\n\n"Well unsurprisingly, they are much more in favor of upholding the status quo. However, it may be prudent to hear out those who are calling to diversify the economy since, well, if anything were to happen to the coal deposits the result would be...well...catastrophic for the economy and Wales as a whole.""

Many in the government believe that the Welsh economy's reliance on coal is a critical weak point and that the economy needs to be opened up for other industries to sprout up. On the other side are those that believe otherwise, seeing the reliance on coal as an indication that coal is still the way forward for Wales.\n\nThe Plaid MP rises to the podium to begin his rebuttal.\n\n"With respect to the honourable Mr Davies, this is a ridiculous notion! There is no evidence that anything will happen that could cause the coal industry to weaken at all. In fact there is abundant evidence to the contrary, the coal industry has never been stronger! Any sort of changes would simply affect the whole economy adversely.""

The Goch, praising the decision, also stated, "The workers are the backbone of the economy. The workers, the people are what matter. Not the big business, not the rich, the people." The bill, which implements higher minimum wages and limits maximum working hours, has been declared by members of Plaid Cymru to be "wasteful". One Plaid member said the following: "Any increase in so-called worker rights and regulations will just cause the productivity of businesses to fall. The increased funding to government agencies to ensure these misguided regulations are enforced is a waste of money in a time where no money can be afforded to be wasted."\n\nGael Dawson smiles to himself, finally the importance of him and his fellow workers was being recognised and appropriately rewarded by the government.

Rather, by removing the shackles that hold businesses back from prosperity, deregulation will open up the way towards a better future for all in Wales. While admittedly some workers' rights have been lost, the amount those same workers and Wales as a whole stand to gain from the economic benefit of deregulation is well worth the loss." Protests have broken out in several cities including Cardiff as workers take to the streets. Some of these have resulted in violent clashes with police with many workers being taken into custody. Many Goch MPs have denounced the controversial decision with one going so far as to calling it an "obscenity" and a "threat to workers' rights everywhere".\n\nGael Dawson frowns, putting down the paper firmly.

Many are attributing this win to the Goch's promises of increased welfare benefits and improved workers' rights including higher minimum wages and a promise to improve working conditions, a position well liked by many voters. Only time can tell whether or not these promises will be fulfilled."\n\n"Oh thank God," Gael breathes, relieved.

John Morris, the leader of the party, is now set to become the second Prime Minister of Wales, promising to reunify England and Wales. Morris, popular amongst the English post war refugees, has already begun to outline his plans to bring about a peaceful unification of England and Wales. Emrys Thomas of the Cymru Gich party has declined to comment on the result but the outspoken, controversial leader of the Free Wales Army, Julian Cayo-Evans made it extremely clear the FWA's position regarding the result declaring his intention to "oppose any attempts to replace the tyrannical English boot upon Wales." Only time can tell whether the Unionist's plan will come to fruition."\n\nGael sighs, it wasn't the increased labour benefits he had been hoping for when he voted for the Goch, but maybe a reunion with England wouldn't be so bad.

The gigantic landslide careened down the mountain and engulfed a significant portion of the village, destroying dozens of homes and, most distressingly of all, the local school.\n\nDesperate rescue teams have been attempting to look for survivors, but scores of bodies have already been recovered from the ruins, the vast majority of them being children. Over a hundred pupils and several dozen teachers were in the school at the time of the disaster, so the ultimate death toll is expected to be very grim indeed. A few older residents were also recovered from collapsed houses, though most people were thankfully away at work at the time.\n\nOutrage has quickly spread across Wales, with many blaming the government's exploitative coal mining policies and lax regulations for the disaster. Questions have been raised as to how the spoil tip was allowed to grow so large in so precarious a place, and particular criticism has been levelled at economic minister Gwynfor Evans and his secretary Roderic Bowen for creating such a loose regulatory environment that would allow a thing like this to happen.

In reality, the divisions on the issue are deep and neither side is keen to fold to the other. This was made clear to all inside the assembly as a member of the Plaid stood up to address the point made by the Goch.\n\n"Whilst the view of the Goch is admirable, it is infeasible within our current economy. Put simply, the country does not have the money for such an irresponsible expansion, in fact it does not even have the money to support the current system."\n\nBarely stifled outrage came from the Goch as they realised what the Plaid was pushing for.

He planned to find a job after a few weeks of recovery. Once he had sorted his life out he could return to work, whether it be in an office, production line or a pit.\n\nHowever, over time no such opportunity arose; he began to get used to the meager life that his benefits allowed. To save what patience he had was not an option. Despite the fact he desperately needed some savings in case his financial situation somehow deteriorated further.\n\nNow is the time he needs the money, money that he never had.

Yet, he thought, the government would sooner capitulate to the demands of the workers than take a stand and accept reality.\n\nBut, it was his job to make the expansion of the welfare program a reality, irrespective of his own convictions on the matter.\n\nSo he continued to work on implementing the new benefits, occasionally taking nervous glances at the cost, knowing full well that they would make him vastly unpopular with a certain group of people."

Grabbing a blunt letter opener that was close to hand, he began to struggle with the seal, carefully trying not to damage the message inside.\n\nOnce he had freed the contents of the envelope he scanned the page and, to his dismay, confirmed his previous thoughts.

Some of them were quietly shocked when the Prime Minister told them that he had invited a group of representatives from several of the country's more powerful unions.\n\nShortly after the ministers had been told of the imminent arrival of the unions, the representatives had begun to file in and quickly took their seats opposite the government. After they had all entered, the PM welcomed them and began to outline what the purpose of the talks would be. They were to discuss the actions of the government over the past few months. The Prime Minister made sure to remind all those present of the legislation his government had passed, sometimes going into painful amounts of detail.\n\nUltimately his lengthy address boiled down to one simple question:\n\nWhat did the unions think of the government?"

wal.28.desc:0 ""You've been great, finally yours is a government I can trust. You better be willing to continue supporting us workers, we would hate to see all your good work go to waste."\n\nThis reply was greatly encouraging for the Prime Minister and his cabinet, they knew that the support of the unions would be very useful. Keeping them satisfied would leave one less issue for the government to deal with in the coming months.\n\nHowever, the cost of the union's support has been immense.\n\nThe Prime Minister had forced his economy minister to make great sacrifices in the budget, in order to expand the welfare programs, as well as forcing huge amounts of strain upon the government to push through reforms to workers rights. The cabinet could only hope that all their efforts would pay off.\n\nAt least, for the time being, the unions were at ease."

You could have helped us, but instead you just left us up to our necks in sheep shit. If this is all you've brought us here for, I don't see any point in saying."\n\nThe meeting did not continue for very long after that.\n\nIt had not gone the way the Prime Minister had intended, he had at least hoped that they would remain neutral toward him. However, the union representatives had made it abundantly clear to the government that they were not just disappointed, they were angry.\n\nWith relations with the unions in tatters, governing will become a much harder task. Those in the government hope that they will not seek some form of vengeance.\n\nThough most have accepted that this is incredibly unlikely."

wal.30.t:0 "A Mixes Response"
wal.30.desc:0 ""Starting the work may be two thirds of it, though I doubt whether you ever wanted the other third to be complete." Came the brief reply from the union representative.\n\nThis was not the level of support the Prime Minister, and indeed the rest of his cabinet, had been hoping for.\n\nThough the ministers were disappointed, the unions scepticism was not unjustified, the government had never completely committed itself to following the wishes of the unions in the first place. The legislation it had passed simply had not gone far enough. And in some worrying cases, it had even reversed some of the progress from the past.\n\nThe talks continued for a little while longer, with the union members urging the government to do more for the workers in the future. However, the ministers opposed them did not pay much attention. So long as the unions were appeased they would not care what they had to say.\n\nEach side left the talks a little more despondent than they had arrived, with nothing of worth to show for their efforts."

wal.31.desc:0 ""Good morning gentlemen. Shall we begin?"\n\nIt's that time of year once again, time for the ministry of Economics to give their report to the government.\n\n"As you can see here," the speaker starts, motioning towards the graph, "coal exports have risen quite dramatically. We should start to see the positive effects of this on the rest of the economy soon. We predict that this will cause employment in the coal industry to rise by between seven and nine percent. The overall positive effects of this..."\n\nAs the speaker's dull voice drones about the room, Brice Davies wakes to a sharp jab to his side.\n\n"You dozed off again! Get it together!" Dylan Reese, his fellow Plaid member, whispers."

wal.32.desc:0 ""....and as you well know, the Welsh military is woefully inadequate. The many threats that we face, especially the English menace, mean that the military budget must be increased in order to properly defend the country."\n\nSaunders Lewis sighs wearily, putting down the letter. Once again the military is requesting more funding in order to protect against "English aggression". There definitely is some merit to their requests, a stronger military would deter any aggressive acts from neighbouring England. However, the budget is rather high as it is and that money could be spent well in other ways, namely reinvesting into the country by improving state services such as better quality schooling.\n\nThen there is the third, almost unspeakable, option, slash the military budget. Europe has been at peace for nearly 20 years and there are many in the country who are of the belief that too much of the government's limited resources are allocated towards a military that serves little purpose."

After the discussion, the meeting spot was chosen in a pub in Cardiff. The FWA asked the representatives from the Plaid to dress in normal clothes and not the clothes they would wear to a government procedure.\n\nOnce they had arrived, an armed FWA member was standing on the inside of the pub. One of the representatives remarked that the whole pub seemed to be owned by the FWA in which one of the FWA members replied to this and said that this pub a few others are used as safe houses by the FWA if they are on the run from the Left Militias that roam Wales. After an hour of negotiations between the two parties, the FWA agreed to stop shooting up Welsh Police barracks and stop the firefights with the Left Militias. The FWA agreed on this as long as the government coalition agreed to move forward with the idea of Welsh Nationalism and begun to start to get rid of influence from the Anglos. The representatives from the government agreed to this proposition and the two parties left from the pub a few minutes after an agreement was reached.\n\nThe next day, a small group of members from the government met to discuss the development with the FWA. After heated discussion from the more left-leaning members of the government, they decided they would honor their agreement and start to include more nationalist elements in the government. After the left-leaning members left in protest, the conversation switched to the raids on the Left Militias. An argument broke out in the group but this had been quelled and the decision was reached, raids would start on the Left."

They wondered about the more radical members of the Plaid and the Free Welsh Army's reaction to this development but they went with it.\n\nAfter contacting the militias that would roam across Wales, a meeting place was decided where the two parties could talk and discuss the current situation of Wales. The place would be the very capital of Wales, Cardiff. Once the two parties arrived in the city, they had begun talks about the situation. The government had sent representatives from all groups of the coalition, but most representatives had been in the social democrats. As the talks had gone on, things had been discussed such as the FWA who had been attacking the left militias on occasion while the government couldn't respond in a timely manner. Then the main topic of the discussion came up. This was a possible agreement for the left militias to support the Plaid Cymru. The militias had been told that they would start to receive some small amounts of support from the government. However, they would need to stop fighting the FWA if this agreement would pass.\n\nThankfully, the representatives from the left militias agreed on these terms and would agree to stop attacks on the FWA. As the members of the Left had left the city, the members of the government who had been sent to the meeting wondered if this was the best choice for Wales and it's future."

He was on his way to meet with a leader of a local union, along with being a newspaper owner, he was also one of the leaders of the Cardiff branch of the Left Militias that roamed around the country. If he remembered correctly, there hadn't been an attack on any of them yet for the past week by the FWA, so he was happy.\n\nAs he walked into the building where he had been told to meet the union leader there was no one there. Isaac was confused. He dropped his umbrella and opened his briefcase. Inside were many pamphlets about unions and leftism in general. However, below those papers was a pistol for protection against the thugs of the FWA. He thought about getting the pistol out just in case but decided against it. There are no armed FWA members all the way here in Cardiff, he thought. As he briskly walked through the building he found it abandoned. He was disappointed that the union leader had bailed on him so he decided to walk back outside and continue on his walk through Cardiff.\n\nOnce he got outside, a light was shone in his face immediately. He stumbled around the outside before a forceful arm grabbed his arm and pinned it behind his back. It was those pigs he thought..\n\n"I have rights to be doing this currently, you have no reason to arrest me!" He yelled this at the officers who had been arresting him. "Orders from the government, you militias have been a risk for too long" Isaac exhaled, realizing that fighting was stupid.\n\nAs he was led into the car by the constable, he swore he noticed a member of the FWA standing next to the police.

They had been ordered to raid a suspected Free Welsh Army safe house and arrest everyone on the inside of it. The goal was to get info on Julian Cayo-Evans, the ringleader of the group.\n\nAt the very break of dawn, the raid had begun, the doors had been kicked down and Welsh soldiers flooded into the house barking orders in both Welsh and English to the members of the FWA on the inside. There were many shouts from the FWA members who had dropped to the ground in shock and fear. A ripple of fear seemed to go through all of them. Who sold them out to the army? Was there a rat within their ranks? This would need to be answered later as they had been put in handcuffs and lead out to awaiting vans. After the FWA members had been lead to the vans and driven off to the prison, one of the constables and a partner walked through the house.\n\nOnce inside they had found all sorts of materials for bombs and improvised weapons. There was what seemed to be a homemade mortar that could have been used to launch attacks on left militia groups or even the local government. The two officers decided to leave it for the following investigative crew to arrive and then dissect the mortar and the rest of the house. As they had begun to walk up the stairs, something caught the eye of the lead constable. There was a map hidden beneath the stairs. Using the butt of his rifle, he smashed the wood and pulled out a map of locations of FWA safe houses across the country. He nodded and rolled it up, bringing it back to the station for analysis."

An agreement had been reached within the party, no militias would be contacted.\n\nYet before this phone call Inside the parliament building, MPs walked through the winding hallways of the building, constantly running papers and prepositions to one another. However within one of these rooms, one of the more heated conversations was taking place. Representatives from both sides of the political frankenstein that was the Plaid Cymru discussed the very actions that they would take. The more right-leaning side was very much for contacting the Free Welsh Army to begun negotiations between the government and the FWA. The left however was very much against this as it would lead to a dangerous rise in Welsh Nationalism and possibly strain the fragile coalition even more. The groups worked for a solution for hours before the phone call had been made to Prime Minister Lewis. Solutions had been brought up and then promptly cut after more consideration. Ideas ranged from pitting the two groups against each other to nationalizing one and marking the other as an enemy to the state.\n\nOn both sides of the political spectrum, the MPs wondered if this debate would ever end. Then, one final idea had been proposed. The solution of letting the two groups had been brought up at the start but tossed to the side as it felt "to hands-off". After this was brought back up, the room was silent to think about the possible ramifications of this agreement. It was then voted on by the MPs, after just ten minutes, the government had reached an agreement. No interference in the militia conflicts. "

This bill was to be the culmination of what they had strived towards ever since independence. It was to be the very symbol of a truly independent Wales.\n\nBut the bill was not without its opponents, as it was introduced to the house objections were already being voiced from the unionist members, Goch members were also noticeably unenergetic with the bill. Seemingly unaware of this, the nationalist member continued to deliver his proposition:\n\n"Us nationalists have always seen conspiracies that seek to destroy the Welsh culture and tradition. It is with the essence of this vigilance against Welsh oppression that I put commend this ban on the teaching of the english language in Welsh schools. We do this to preserve our language and make ourselves invulnerable to the foreign deceit and desires of our neighbours.\n\nSeveral unionist members arose from their seats to put forward a rebuttal, one was chosen and he glared down at the nationalist MP as he launched into his counter argument.\n\n"I beg to move that this assembly asserts that the proposed bill is objectionable in principle and unfair and unworkable in practice. I, along with every other unionist member of this assembly, am of the belief that the problems it creates for pupils, teachers and local governments will be far greater than the government is willing to let itself believe."\n\nThe atmosphere of the assembly collapsed and rapidly became uncontrollable as both sides spat abuse towards one another.

However, this has not helped to preserve much unity in the government, as both wings continued to tear each other apart over the bill.\n\nThe Prime Minister would not let his position on the matter remain unknown any longer, he could not bear to see his government constantly at odds with each other.

Instead he uncovered a file from his desk and took out the documents that were inside and began to do his work.\n\nA thin tipped brush accurately coated sections of the page, concealing the print beneath it. Page after page received the same thin layer over each offending word or statistic. Once he had reached the end of the document he turned it over and began to type over what he had censored. Fixing what he saw necessary and leaving blank what he thought could not be salvaged.\n\nSatisfied with his efforts he moved onto the next file. And is how he worked for the rest of that day. He would return for the next to do much the same thing, to make sure that all the government did not want to see was altered.\n\nOut of sight"

Production had continued to drop off over the past month, money no longer coming in his profits were rapidly diminishing. Soon he would not be able to even pay those who he sent down into the depths. It did not take him long to hurridley arrive at his destination, where he got out of his car and rushed inside to spend another day worrying over numbers.\n\nWhen he burst through the door of his office he noticed an odd package that lay on his desk amongst papers that were strewn around it from the night before. He opened it with a hasty suspicion and was awash with relief as he saw what was inside.\n\nMoney, bundles upon bundles of thin paper notes tied loosely with string. A message fell out, it threateningly requested that he stayed silent about the situation of the mine. The cash was not just all form, he was expected to share some with his workers as a bonus for their collective silence.\n\nHe pocketed his share and all of a sudden he was not as concerned as he had been earlier that day."

Which has caused the disarray that has gripped the government these past few months to seep into the rest of public life. The crisis has begun much sooner than was anticipated.

Those who still remain loyal to the party have started to look for ways to try and salvage what credibility they can. The plan that they decided on was an attempt to conceal Saunders' role in the cover up and presenting him as a trusted leader, who was independent from the dirty work that others had carried out.\n\nThe best way to present this had already been decided by the party, an interview between the Prime minister and interviewer from one of the few media outlets that had remained indifferent to Plaid Cymru. An interview had already been scheduled as soon as possible. All that remains to be done is to inform Saunders himself.\n\nUpon being told of the plan Saunders was quietly startled, he had not been expecting to have to be put back into the public eye so soon, especially after such a crisis had unfurled. After hearing the date of the broadcast he only felt more anxious. For once Saunders appeared to dread having to talk to the people of Wales."

Yet he knew that he had to get through it, for the sake of his credibility and his party.\n\nThe interviewer finished addressing the audience and all to soon lept into questioning the Prime Minister:\n\n"We are all aware of the crisis that has developed over the last few days, but were you involved in any way with the initial response to the investigation's findings and its subsequent cover up?"\n\n"Not at all" came the uncharacteristically short reply; Saunders left it at that.\n\nThe rest of the interview continued in a similar fashion, with the reporter asking increasingly probing questions and Saunders stubbornly refusing to answer in any detail. Deny everything, tell them nothing.\n\nWhen an aide asked Saunder how he thought it all went he shrugged and muttered in a low voice."

Theories have already started to be reported on groups from across the world and political spectrum conspiring to bring Wales down for increasingly absurd reasons. Many of these have not had any noticeable impact, but one that has started to gain traction is the idea that somehow the socialists were involved.\n\nThe theory explains how they attempted to cover up the coal shortage to keep the miners underground. When the government reports investigation returned they sent men disguised in suits to remove whatever evidence they could find. Fortunately a forward thinking member of the government was able to release the truth.\n\nIn fact it has been such an influential theory that it has reached government offices. Pinning the blame on the Goch and trade unionists would cause enough confusion to clear our own name. A government statement was produced indicating Gwynfor Evans and every other influential socialist in the government.\n\nFollowing the release of the statement, the Goch is expected to remove themselves from their position in our government, greatly weakening our authority. Our government will not be expected to last much longer.\n\nAt least we are not the only ones that are accused."

Shocked was replaced by anger as the Welsh demanded to know how Evans was allowed to operate such a scheme. How could a split this bad have emerged in the party in the first place? Did he act alone or does he still have subordinates working in the government?\n\nThey demanded answers.\n\nAnswers the government did not have.\n\nThose who remained in the government hoped it had not all been in vain.

Framing them for the cover up would alienate them further from ever becoming a serious part of Welsh politics. Moreover, Cayo and the rest of his gang are a mad enough group that most people would believe that they would attempt a move that was so ridiculous. So the government went ahead with the plan to accuse the FWA.\n\nWhat took place after the accusation only made things worse for Plaid Cymru.\n\n\The people were alarmed by how far the FWA got and how they were almost allowed to get away with what they did. The government failed to clear its role in the cover up and was only able to make the FWA appear far more competent than was previously thought.\n\nAfter consistently failing to find a way out of the crisis, few reckon that the government will last much longer.

Now that he has been proven right, he has to sit still whilst all that he helped to build up crumbles around him.\n\nWith the socialists out of the picture, it was unlikely that any of the other members of the National Front Saunders had worked so hard to form were going to stay.

Accusations lying cheating and causing the crisis follow him throughout his days. He has become tired of having to repeat the same denials again and again, every time he does so it only seems to make them angrier and more intent on bringing him down.\n\nOne day he supposed he would be the only one left denying what had happened.\n\nUntil that imagined day came he would have to continue wading through the mess he created.

Because of all his failures, he would almost certainly be removed from power.\n\nHe already believed his time was up.\n\nNow, as he resigned to his inevitable demise, Saunders finally had time to reflect. He wondered if it could have gone differently; if he could have held the National Front together ,if he could have come clean over the crisis; if he could have held onto the trust of the Welsh people.\n\nBut in the end he could only ask himself one question:"

Gently tipping the balance here and there, in order to preserve his government. He was already submerged in corruption, why should he not continue along the path he set out for himself?\n\nOr maybe this is all too far, thought Saunders.\n\nIf he was caught again he would certainly become even more infamous. His cause would also become permanently damaged, tainted by his involvement. Welsh nationalism would likely never recover. It would be better for the sake of the nationalists if he finally took a step away from his position.\n\nYet it was the Prime Minister who ultimately decided who would determine the future of Wales."

As the debate continues, the language bill will likely fall further and further into the background, as the battle lines divide "nationalists" from everyone else, whether they prefer the title of liberal, anti-fascist, or unionist.

Even if he could not officially call himself a Unionist, it was not yet a crime to support their aims.

The confrontations at these barricades have so far been relegated to aggressive shouting matches, but with passions being sky-high all it will take is one spark to blow up. We can't preside over a bloodbath on our streets.\n\nTypically, our response to confrontations like these is a strong police presence. They are generally expected to show up, and are skilled in non-violent tactics, so using them as peacekeepers seems like it can only deescalate things. However, some of our advisors have pointed out that there are credible reports of some demonstrators carrying projectiles and firearms, and the police may not be enough to keep order.

As families tried to rest their children in total darkness, avoiding even the slightest give-away of human life, nearby homes were torn through so that gunmen could set up sniper nests in attics. As pub owners rushed to barricade their business, sheltering civilians if they're brave, long-standing corner stones saw themselves burnt away by Molotov Cocktails, proxies for the malfeasance of the Welsh state.\n\nRegardless of these nightmarish travails, a broader survey would reveal a bend towards deescalation. Ramping up of violence also meant potentially thousands of protesters fleeing for their lives, with even some of the most aggressive partisans preferring to shelter far from the city center rather than risk dying on Cardiff's streets.

With the raising of her fist, Angela began the charge towards this alleged bunker.\n\nHours later, when the whole Senedd was ravaged to reveal hastily evacuated bunkers and smashed out windows still fresh with the blood of those poor sods trying to escape, Angela and her comrades from the Anti-Fascist club sat in the opulent banquet hall, taking just enough shots of the three-hundred year old bourbon to loosen up, but not soften their edges. Hundreds still remained in the Senedd, and one of the comrades began cracking up, saying that Wales really did belong to the people and not just fat pricks with bad taste in art. That was when they started hearing sirens.\n\nHow long had it been? How long had these radicals been occupying the halls of power? Once again taking initiative, Angela called on her comrades and anyone nearby to take up positions that had line of sight on different entryways. Minutes later, when the haphazard welcoming committee took up positions, the attack started. The dozens of seasoned radicals hunkered down..."

Angela ran over to Dominic, a longtime ally in the struggle, knowing he had a revolver on him. Upon reaching him, he started moving with her to an exit. These criminals, she thought, trying to slaughter us for exposing their lies.\n\nThe two moved carefully, having lost sight of some of the other comrades. No matter how hard they tried, the worst assumptions immediately came to mind. All around them, the Senedd was being ripped apart, hi-caliber fire from the military men drowning out the sporadic bangs of civilian-owned revolvers. Moving as liquid, they flowed through the stairway, the corridors, avoiding any sign of the black-clad troops. Finally they saw it; a small but shattered window, a few feet above where they stood. In quick succession, the two vaulted up the wall and squeezed their way out of the narrow frame, crashing against the pavement as they came out. For a few minutes, the two sat and looked into the darkly beautiful spectacle of those ravaged halls of government. But soon, they opted to run off, maybe even run out of this city, this country. Because already they knew in their hearts it had spilled the blood of their comrades to sustain itself."

So she did all she could do: lie down and wait for what was coming.\n\nOne hour later, Angela found herself lined up on a wall, next to longtime ally Dominic, and about a dozen strangers who'd followed them into the Senedd. Angela still felt her head swimming, still felt the throbbing pain in her back from when the soldiers manhandled her. She tried turning to Dominic, tried to get perspective from a fellow comrade. This attempt at communication was rapidly met by a boot to the face. With everyone on the wall restrained, the could merely watch and shout as Angela writhed in pain. Finally, the hulking commando in front of them spoke. Not to those he had just restrained, but to his radio.\n\n"Everything is under control. Minimal casualties, Senedd has been cleared out.

However, few of the state's agents were to be found; for the police, the firemen, this was a resounding success.

The Industrial Reform Committee will be the government's platform for ethically dealing with the coal industry and the myriad of related organisations.\n\nThe focus of the newly birthed IRC's opening moves is quite straightforward: the multitudinous unions in the many fields in the coal industry. The only way for the government to achieve its goal of weakening this almost all-powerful industry is dependent on the support of these unions. From there, it is simpler. The Welsh economy must be freed from the death grip of the sinking coal industry before it drags the whole economy under. In order to do so, the industry must be weakened by opening other industries to loosen the hold of coal.

Afterall, the men these unions represent depend on the coal industry for their livelihoods. A man who has mined his whole life cannot easily find another occupation. The IRC must tread lightly around the unions. This meeting with the biggest players and most influential unions is the first move.\n\n"Well that wasn't so bad," Davies remarks as he leaves the meeting with the Union leaders, his fellow committee members filing out after him.

For from this day the government, at the behest of the IRC, has banned any and all harsh quotas. No longer can the mine owners exploit their workers by giving them outrageous, unreachable goals.\n\nThe miners are celebrating in the streets, in the pubs in their homes. For today their burdens have lessened ever so slightly. The quotas may still be extreme, but less so. Their mine owners may be furious at this drop in productivity, but that isn't their problem. They may still live difficult lives, they may still struggle to provide for their families, to put food on their tables, but for this brief moment they are joyous, grateful to the government for looking out for them.

Wales wants them, we have them and Wales is willing to pay for them. Wales has proven to be no close friend of the Germans and supporting a European democracy may help to further our influence in Europe.

As some of the more astute among you may have noticed, me and Mr Thomas do indeed differ considerably in our prefered methods of bringing about such improvements.

But the government does not have the time to dwell on past misconceptions, the crisis is far too great to do such a thing.\n\nCoal has been the cornerstone of the Welsh economy and now that it has been eroded away, the rest of the structure is likely to crumble along with it. If it does it will take much more effort to clear the rubble and rebuild the foundations than if a new support can be put in its place.\n\nHowever one looks at it, one thing is clear.

Will they lose their centuries old communities, how will the miners who may be layed of provide for their families; what future will there be for their children?\n\nThe Conservatives believe that propping up the mines will only amount to a drain on public finances. It would be better to allow Wales to decide the fate of the coal mines free from the unnecessary intervention of the government.\n\nLabourists within the government are strictly opposed to such measures. They would much rather that the government step in to support what remains of the old mining communities by bailing them out. Else where will the mining societies go next, what future will there be for their people.\n\nMorris and his closest ministers are yet to finalize their decision and all of them know of its critical importance to the future of Wales."

The institutes that they had studied had been forced to shut due to a sudden stop to its government funding.\n\nThis was a step too far for the generation of students who had grown up in the time of the Welsh cultural revitalization. They had been riled up and they began to march towards the assembly itself, the place where the government they opposed so profoundly had passed the budget cuts.\n\nHowls from the streets could be heard from within the chamber.

Most of its contents seemed reasonable and the majority of the introductory speech passed without interruption, with the exception of a couple wayward nationalist outbursts. But that was changed when Edwards closing sentence entered the chamber:\n\n"English will always be the language of Wales"\n\nRoars of indignation came from the opposition who had fought so hard to bring Welsh out of obscurity. Yet the bill remained popular and after a short debate it was passed.\n\nAs was to be expected, the worst of the fanatical nationalists found the result to be unacceptable and were enraged at the fact that they had lost.

It was the cause that he had championed these past few weeks and the cause he intends to see through till it's inevitable end.\n\nWhat began as a fairly minor emphasis of his unionist principles suddenly became unacceptable to Nationalists after he made stated his belief that:\n\n"The Acts of Union were the single most greatest part of Welsh history!"\n\nA great response followed from the supportive crowd he had already riled up, but, intentional or not, there was a very serious response.

Neither of these groups truly reflect the large portion of the population that has preferred the use of the English language all along. Amongst these groups English has quickly replaced the little Welsh they spoke, if they spoke any of it at all.\n\nAnd with the language several other parts of english culture has arrived into welsh life, strangely no longer practiced in Wales' repressive and chaotic neighbour.

Repairing the damage would take almost a year, argued Bruce, as if that fact would redeem his proposal in any way.\n\nSeveral cabinet members were appalled that such action should even be suggested.

And it had succeeded in permanently preventing nationalist influence spreading throughout the army.\n\nIndeed there was not even a hint of Welsh spoken in the ranks of the army any more. Nationalism had all but disappeared from their lives. Those who had survived the clean up made sure that they avoided the subject entirely, in order to not be relieved of their positions.\n\nBut the gaps had been filled, the army had been replenished and after such a long time the military had recovered. But the damage to the soldiers had already been done, not that they spoke out against it."

The events that had followed the decision to purge the military have scarred it deeply. Those who remain are nervous to speak out against what happened. All nationalist sentiment has been wiped away completely.\n\nIn a way the whole purge has been a success. It has achieved all of the aims that the government set out to. There is no nationalism to be found and loyalty has been obtained.\n\nThis is a hollow victory.\n\nNo joy can be taken from causing the army to be as badly weakened as it has become. If it is called upon to protect Wales now there would not be any hope, it has become far too weak.\n\nThe soldiers are aware of this and they now look to the future not with hope but with fear."

But those classes did not have to cope with the confusion that had been caused a few months ago when the history curricula shifted suddenly.\n\nMonths scrambling to get to grips with the new English oriented test have however paid off. Despite the confusion, they have learnt in months what future students will have years to study and they have prevailed.\n\nThey are expected to be the first generation of many students to pass from this new English oriented system.

Putting in an order for a replacement would inevitably result in silence, no new books had been made since the new government had come into power.\n\nSoon, he thought, he would have to deliver the whole of the course from memory. If he was still allowed to teach it at all.\n\nWelsh history was no longer as popular as it has been. The size of his class has noticeably shrunk, the classroom itself was barely half fall. He hoped that won day students would flock back to his classrooms to hear what he had learnt.\n\nBut with Unionism on the rise there would be no place in Wales for what the subject he had loved to teach."

The students still remained interested in their history and no government intervention could change that. Even if all that remained of the old books were old and battered by time.\n\nAn unblemished and freshly printed book was left unread beside them.\n\nIn spite of the government's efforts to alter their history, the students remained as intrigued about Welsh history as the students who had studied the book before them.

They believe that the government should build new war ships to replace the navy that was lost all those years ago.\n\nNevertheless building a new navy from scratch will be extremely expensive. Going ahead with these plans would be risky especially as public support for them is expected to be low.

The particular piece he held in his hands alleged that the Germans were secretly controlled by Swiss financiers, and somehow it went on that subject for almost twelve pages. It was a moment of calm in the constant eddies of government, something to be valued.\n\nThe man who was supposed to riddle the car with bullets found himself unable to do so as his ancient semi-automatic rifle failed to fire, which allowed the driver just enough time to put his foot on the pedal and dodge the first volley of gunfire. But the second series of shots took out the wheels, flipping the car over as the driver attempted to compensate in a cacophony of metal striking road.\n\nJulian Cayo-Evans emerged from the wreckage with his pistol raised, but with his eyes blocked by blood and smoke he didn't manage to hit anything. This allowed the assassins, all twenty three of them, to open up on the exposed dictator in one deafening volley. The force of the bullets was such that for a brief moment Cayo-Evans was pinned to his car despite have no chance of survival after the first hit his windpipe, this caused several of the more insecure assasins to assume he remained alive and the gunfire would not alight for almost three minutes.\n\nForensic analysis would determine that over fifteen hundred shots had been fired, of which almost seventy three hit Cayo-Evans."

This was far from the joyous reuniting of friends that had been promised; this was the death of a once hopeful and independent Welsh Republic.\n\nSeveral members of the Welsh Assembly did not listen to, nor care for, what the king had to say. All they could do was stand silently and stifle their sadness and tears as the Republic they had always supported was torn down before them.\n\nMorris stood toward the back, no longer feeling the need to stand center stage.

There would be no FWA guerilla nor Plaid member that could possibly stop him now.

Welsh producers everywhere were being thoroughly outcompeted by their counterparts across the border. They felt like they were to be sidelined once again, with the english never giving a second thought about welsh interests.\n\nGreat sadness swept the nation as little shops like Erin's gave way to the tide of English dominance.

Even if half the men doing so were interim operators from the FWA, it was still a marvellous feeling. He had won.\n\nNow, he walked into the station's studio, accompanied by the new head of the formerly toothless and liberal institution. Sitting in the tall, comfortable leather seat, he took one breath and started to work through his words.

You all know me as a patriot, as the leader of the Free Welsh Army. I appreciate this image, but it is not my whole self. True, I am a cunning commander, a friend to my allies and ruthless in dealing with foes, but there is much more to me, and my brothers-in-arms, than just that. Through my leadership, the FWA has proven to be made of effective administrators, compassionate family men, and hard workers. These are the virtues that we aim to bring in every aspect of our government and society. But that, my countrymen, is just the beginning!"\n\n"Under my leadership, the genocidal practices leftover from English domination shall be destroyed. No longer must we feel ashamed of our culture, of our language! In every schoolhouse, in every business, in every theater and bookshop, the heroic history of our nation and people will be celebrated. A true independence can begin from this, one where all Welshmen are truly free from all the forces that dog him. The snide gaze of the Anglo, the callous abandonment of the villages, the feminization of our military, these are all shameful facets of our young nation that we shall absolutely combat. We are in a land surrounded by wolves, and if we do not act as if we are already engaged in a vicious battle of survival, then we shall perish as a free nation. Today is just the beginning of the great Welsh century. Our tasks are many, our foes are mighty, but as a people we shall tear them all down on the road to sovereignty!"

No matter how hard he tried, it seemed impossible to fully excise from his mind the horrible maelstrom that occurred during the Cardiff March. How foolish of him to think that nothing worse would come after, that life would quickly return to normal.\n\nEver since the ascendance of Julian Cayo to the leadership of state, Alex had been watching with deep anxiety over the new pronouncements coming out everyday. Goch Cymru never meant much to him. Just barely of voting age, the only reason he found himself at their headquarters was because of their recent opening for a mail writer. Returning to his typewriter, he was set to prepare his seventh version of the latest letter leadership wanted sent out: a simple donation request given Cayo's recent bluster against them. The situation had made him for the first time feel a connection to all this, feel like he was part of something that could help Wales. Why, he wondered, was I so averse to supporting my employers?\n\n9:25 am. Alex hears screams coming from the first floor, hears the front desk secretary crying out for help. Suddenly, he's back in that awful night: gunfire, broken glass, fear permeating every pore of his body. The world seems to melt away in this paralysis, every wall just a mere transient presence--\n\nThe screams came hard and fast. Five men in FWA fatigues, submachine guns slung over their backs. He can hardly leave his seat before one pulls him out of it, grabs him by the collar of his sweater, and throws him on the ground. A military boot begins to stomp on his face, then his gut, and before he knows it crushing blows land from seemingly every direction. Then it's over. A crackle from a radio returns him to reality once again. "Goch Cymru has been taken care of here in Cardiff, can we move on to that damn commie press they have running on 8th Street?" Then, the men ran off, leaving Alex and the rest of his coworkers to endure the aftermath."

Starting on her third pint of stout, she swam once again into the hell that her past had been in this miserable country. Her escape west nearly two decades ago, running off to Swansea with her newly married husband. It was supposed to be a fairy tale, a journey through the land of dragons. Instead, it became an ever-tightening labyrinth.\n\nTwo years ago, the man she thought would be hers forever finally left. That philandering, distant piece of shit finally had the courage to walk away. Looking back, it was foolish to think anything could become better in the Welsh nightmare. Instead, she was simply left to rotate through various menial jobs in the city, left with no respite if she found herself fired. A few of her smarter friends told her to join Goch Cymru, to fight for a red Wales. She never took interest, and now her friends haven't been seen in weeks.\n\nAs she stood up, Helen quickly got her bearings. A high tolerance for drink was necessary to survive in Swansea. Turning to the bartender, she told him goodbye, then slowly made her way to the door. Exiting into the cold, damp night, Helen barely thought it necessary to wonder whether someone had called her a "skinny Anglo bitch". Just leave it behind, only swing at them if necessary. Then, she heard it again.\n\n"Hey, this country--" the voice slurred, "This country belongs to us now, not you grubs. Fuckin' move outta here, or Cayo will getcha!"\n\nHelen thought she could keep going, keep ignoring and not get dragged into a bar fight. Then the bald man swung in from behind and shoved her onto the cold pavement, started shouting and saying things about how she was a communist, a wolf in sheep's clothing. When a woman came up behind this hairless, middle-age pugilist, she simply pulled him away and they disappeared into night. Slowly, Helen got to her feet, and gazed up to the stars.

Before Cayo's coup, before all the anti-English messaging began to flood the streets, they already were known to pick on the quiet kids, the solo kids. But something changed a few months back. They began to pick new targets, singled out any Anglo-sounding kid even if they were relatively popular. For the victims of the shoving, the smashing of lunches, the jeering as they walked home, they thought maybe they could come together and change something. At least, their parents did.\n\nAndrew was always a favorite victim of theirs. Even before they began to style themselves as "Welsh Warriors," the noogies came without end. But when things escalated, when he came home one day with a nosebleed, his mother went straight to the principal. All she got was dismissal, saying that it was just a bit of "boyhood fun." With just a few months to go, Andrew was convinced he could stick things out before moving to some new school. Today, looking out to the sea on the horizon, he wondered where else he could attend, what other lands lie beyond. Then, he was slammed against the chain-link fence.\n\n"Hey Anglo, thinking about running away? Thought you could leave us? We're supposed to be good buddies." Dylan's voice was unmistakable, the way too gruff tone that cuts through you like a razor blade.\n\n"Yeah, they just never wanna be your friends, no matter how nice you are." Adam, the classic imitator. Andrew couldn't recall one time where his insults weren't just copied off of Dylan.\n\n"Heh, heh. Maybe he was gonna blow something up, yeah Anglo?" Maxwell always squealed like a pig. "I say we dump him in the sea."\n\n"Ooh, I like that. He can swim all the way back to England," said Dylan. "Then we don't need to see your shit-butt haircut anymore."\n\n"Yeah. It is a shit-butt haircut," remarked Adam.\n\n"Well, Anglo, it is early. We're gonna leave for now, but just thought you should be reminded who's boss. Keep looking at the sea, pretend we're not here. And don't you dare tell, or what just happened is gonna look like we were playing nice," Dylan rasped. With that, the Welsh Warriors let Andrew go, and ran back off to torment some other poor soul.

We've all turned to him like he's the damn teacher: What's Cayo gonna do, what do you think happened to the Colonel and Major, where do you think they are? He doesn't know, of course, but we really can't complain. They were both real assholes, and everyone loves Powell.\n\n16 August:Finally. Today, we were introduced to our new black-clad commanders. Replacing the old guard are Colonel Saer and Major Gruffud, neither of which looked to have broken 30. Hell, the Major looks like he could be Powell's younger brother. Thankfully, they immediately operated like real leaders. We got split up into various small groups, 'cells', I think they called them. Said they were modelling unit structure on how the FWA did it. While we were dividing up into these newly assigned groups, we all wondered if Jones and Rice would mouth off, them typically being quite open to boisterous talks of politics. Nothing happened thankfully, though I don't recall seeing them as we split off.\n\n1 September:This one will be short. New drills are exhausting. Ten miles we ran today, full gear in a rainstorm, which isn't too much worse than what we once did. But then our daily guerilla training started. For the English devils they said, the ones who will inevitably try to destroy us. We had to shed some gear as we began to fan out into the (abandoned) neighboring village, and were instructed to spend the next hour moving from house to house, collecting some kind of token from each to show we did it. Gruelling shit. FWA boys are crazy.\n\n16 September:Tonight, one month into the new leadership, we receive our first 'political education course'. Nobody really knows what to expect, at least not the average guys like me. A few new recruits from the FWA are saying it's just a more interesting version of history, mixed with some important lessons for the self. Me and my cell would drink heavy under normal circumstances before something like this, but unfortunately Saer and Gruffud are much stricter on the flow of booze. It doesn't help that something like thirty of our guys got discharged, a few that I liked a lot. Oh well. I'm here for the country, not for myself. "

He'd always dreamed of a free brotherhood of Celtic nations, he'd seen them be freed from England by the German invasion yet to Cayo's own consternation no one had proposed the obvious next step.\n\nWell, if the other free Celtic nations of the world would not do it then it fell to the oldest sibling to give them a push. The Celtic Liberation Army was the first step of his plan, and Cayo-Evans felt that it was also the most important. Before the Celtic nations could begin working against England in a united front they would have an army capable of defeating them. A unified army under one command, and with one vision. Only then could the matter of England be settled properly.\n\nYet as he sat at his desk the Y Mab Darogan couldn't help but check over the text once more, he thought it eloquent enough but there was no shame in having it looked over once again to make sure. Calling his secretary, Julian Cayo-Evans took the first step into a new world."

He promised factories in the cities and an expanded agricultural base, he promised jobs and pay for every Welshmen who could work and pensions for those who could not. Even when it came to the often discussed subject of reform the Y Mab Darogan made clear his intentions to never harm the rights of the Welsh people, and that he would turn the cesspit of political intrigue into something that served everyone and not the privileged and English few.\n\nCapped off with a denunciation of England, the speech was the most popular one by Cayo-Evans yet. Though some doubt his sincerity on the subject of political reform, none could deny that from a distance it didn't seem to be a half bad plan. Well, none denied it openly anyway.

Yet as the Free Wales Army became a party of government there had been increasing clashes between the assorted wings, between social democrats, conservatives and fascists who might all have believed in a free Wales, but disagreed what those two words meant.\n\nThe Y Mab Darogan as always listened, waited, and then acted swiftly and without hesitation. Several trade union leaders affiliated with the FWA were summoned to Cardiff, along with them a host of the more protectionist or socialist leaning FWA members from across the nation and as they sat in Julian Cayo-Evans office it became apparent who was not there. The Church, the businessman and the ardent fascists were mysteriously absent from the meeting.\n\nWhen the men left the office not a few hours later a plan had been drawn out, negotiated and finalised. Pensions for the Welsh, national ownership of several industries, and the state working with rather than against the Trade Unions.

The average man wants naught but food and a roof over his head but the Y Mab Darogan strives for something more for his nation. It is not enough that Wales be a respected nation when it can be a great nation if it but pushes a little harder.\n\nTo this end Cayo-Evans has called forth those who share his vision, the businessmen and the police chiefs. The churchmen and the mayors and the political friends of old who aided the Free Wales Army when it was a mere fragment of the organisation that it has become.\n\nThey are given an offer, wealth and power will be theirs if they would merely consider supporting the government where necessary.

The German is an aristocratic man of Junker stock who gives the Hitler salute to the Y Mab Darogan when he enters the room as befits a friend of the Reich. The Irishwoman merely gives some words of encouragement for Cayo-Evans bold rejection of English imperialism.\n\nFrom all the nations of the world they come and each and every one seeks a deal or an accommodation with the new state of affairs.

Julian Cayo-Evans might not be inclined against elections in and of himself, but the fact of the matter is that a loss or worse a doubted victory could prove damaging to the international reputation of the nation.\n\nAt the same time however, not holding elections at all is a very dangerous business. It clues people in to the fact that they don't have that much power in the decision making process, and when that happens people start to get uppity. In the kind of way where governments fall and new powers rise from the ashes.

The Celtic world might say it is the longest subjugated of the brythonic peoples and was the last to be freed from tyranny. But if you ask the ordinary Welshmen you will have a different and far more interesting answer.\n\nWhom was it that freed the Welsh from Unionist tyranny? Twas the Free Wales Army. Who stood against England and all her cunning plans to force Wales into submission once more? The Free Wales Army. Who will you vote for in the National Assembly elections? The Free Wales Army.\n\nThe party, movement and militia has become so synonymous with Wales that to mention the nation is to mention the party in the eyes of some.

Today, Prime Minister Chesterton gave a fiery oratory in Westminster targeted directly at us, proclaiming that "Wales has for centuries been an integral domain of the British nation, and in time all must come to respect this ancient claim, whether by way of words or by strength of English arms!"\n\nThough we may have hoped this was mere nationalist drum-beating, reports of English armed forces slowly amassing along the border have dashed this fantasy. It is clear that the English intend to restore the old Kingdom, and they have no intention of consulting the Welsh nation's feelings on the matter. Time is short, and it is clear that we must ready our forces. Though the English may possess the numerical advantage, they shall come to know that the Welsh spirit cannot so easily be tamed."
