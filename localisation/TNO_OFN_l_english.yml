 OFN.1.t:0 "The South African Summit"
 OFN.1.desc:0 "The long awaited date of the American called 'Summit on the Policing Action in South Africa' has arrived. The United States delegate gave a rather spirited speech on the necessity for the OFN to come together for this battle, lest the organization begin to fall to the wayside. Points were made that the Unity-Pakt's lack of cooperation led to the seeming death of Germany, and that Japan could never rely on a unified multi-national military response like only the OFN could organize. A hint of fear was pushed as well, with the American delegates attempting to make a point that failure to answer this threat would lead to the threats coming to the members of the OFN.\n\nWhile McNamara's speech received applause led by Deputy Secretary Stikker and other representatives from the various governments in exile, and some smaller approval from Canada and Australias delegates, others seemed hesitant.\n\nThe most telling response came from the representatives from the West Indies[USAGetIcelandAndGuyana], all of whom had already voiced their disagreement with the war and their involvement. President Porbergsson of Iceland, the nations first after the end of US military occupation last year with the death of General Meloy Jr. and known for his firey nationalist views, led the resistance to the proposal. Arguing that the various 'puppet states' to America have never had interest in American adventures, and decrying that they would never allow their blood to die on foreign soil, his own speech led to another round of applause from many other delegates.\n\nThe decision will ultimately be up to vote, and many wait with baited breath whether the OFN will prove itself as an alliance of steel or one of paper."
 OFN.1.a:0 "We vote for victory!"
 OFN.1.b:0 "I'll be damned if our boys bleed for Africa!"

 OFN.2.t:0 "Increase Efforts in South Africa"
 OFN.2.desc:0 "The American officer stationed in Paramaribo handed over a request from the American Chief of Staff this morning. He wants us to send more men, as we neither see any oppertunity nor any reason to object we reply that we will send a division as soon as we can."
 OFN.2.a:0 "Yes, sir!"

 OFN.3.t:0 "Support Staff to Africa"
 OFN.3.desc:0 "Very far down south, there is a war going on. American General H. Howse has relayed a message that requests support staff to help with organizing hostipals and administrating logistics. Some volunteers have voiced their concerns with the temprature, afraid that they will not stand the heat. Anyways, the first group of men has already left Reykjavik, with destination Cape Town."
 OFN.3.a:0 "It's gonna be way too hot!"

 OFN.8.t:0 "We Must Send Men to Africa"
 OFN.8.desc:0 "The war in South Africa is raging on, and the Americans have requested us to mobilize forces to defend the freedom and democracy of the South African people. With the state of the Federation, this is certainly not the optimal time to send out troops we could sue to enforce the peace. Demands are demands and we realize we have no choice in the matter, so today we have sent out telegrams to various stations to call out for volunteers."
 OFN.8.a:0 "Okay, then"

 OFN.9.t:0 "Canada Must Help!"
 OFN.9.desc:0 "Formerly fellow commonwealth member, South Africa, is being invaded by nazis! We should do what we can to help them, it is a long way from home, but when our Alliance calls upon us to rescue a nation from evil and tyranny, we must do what we can!"
 OFN.9.a:0 "Do our duty!"

 OFN.10.t:0 "The Church Endorse the War Efforts"
 OFN.10.desc:0 "The past week several congregations have encouraged their members to sign up for military service. They stress the unchristian values that national socialists espouse, and stresses the need to save the christian people of the Cape land. South Africa is the lone democracy in Africa, and it is our christian duty to protect the freedom and root out the evil, for the glory of God."
 OFN.10.a:0 "Bless our soldiers"

 OFN.13.t:0 "Kick Start the Media"
 OFN.13.desc:0 ""This is the seven o'clock evening news. Tonight's top story: the shocking images coming from the Nazi invasion of South Africa, the last democracy on the continent..."\n\nIn millions of households across America, the exact same story was being aired from every single radio and television station, as agreed at a high-level meeting between media executives and the Nixon administration.\n\n"We face a desperate struggle, a struggle for the survival of freedom in the face of Nazi tyranny. The Americans must know that in the face of totalitarian aggression, there can be no compromise."\n\nA haggard Prime Minister Sir De Villiers Graaf of South Africa made a desperate plea for international intervention to the hearts of Americans. A snide question, asking if said freedom extended to the Africans, was edited out.\n\n"By God, Walter, we can't sit this one out! We lost the last war, but not for lack of trying. What did Shakespeare say: A coward dies a thousand deaths..."\n\nThe assembled panelists all nodded in agreement. The studio had been careful to vet everyone beforehand; there would be no peaceniks on the airwaves today, and tomorrow, and the day after."
 OFN.13.a:0 "It's a just war; everyone says so!"

 OFN.14.t:0 "Reports on Boer Atrocities Covers the Front Pages"
 OFN.14.desc:0 "Desmond, an active construction worker in New York City, heads to a grocery store to pick up the latest edition of the New York Times. He had a long conversation with a coworker about the South African War, and the conflict was still fresh in his mind as he left work today.\nThe man selected his copy from the grocery store counter and opened it, finding today's leading headline in bold: "WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA RAGES ON." Ever since war broke out between the Reichskommissars and the Republic, Desmond publicly showed his strong opposition. When he was not working, he could be seen at anti-war protests throughout New York City. He began reading about the recent German offensives ripping through the South African heartland and wondered why he was paying taxes to support such a pointless war. Once he reached the bottom of the article, a new bold headline appeared directly under it: "BOER MASSACRES TAKE HUNDREDS OF LIVES."\n\nDesmond couldn't believe what he was reading in this article. The Boers, supported by Germany, were brutally raping, enslaving, and killing women and children; at least 500 individuals suffered at the hands of the invading party, and the war was only just beginning. It was then that Desmond really saw the scope of the war and why it was so necessary for Americans to get involved: innocent, unarmed human lives were at stake. The man imagined what could have happened if his wife, daughter, and son were victims of the Boer atrocities. As he gave the cashier a handful of coins, he began to contemplate whether he really can support the war effort."
 OFN.14.a:0 "The boers are not nice, right now"

 OFN.16.t:0 "Send Our Mates across the Sea"
 OFN.16.desc:0 "An American Telegram arrived last night, it was a request to increase our efforts in Africa, asking us to send more men. Some of the more liberal people in our parliment has responded that our economy is not in the shape needed to afford such an operation."
 OFN.16.a:0 "Sure thing, General"
 OFN.16.b:0 "We cannot afford such operations right now"

 OFN.17.t:0 "Do Our Duty"
 OFN.17.desc:0 "The South African war is a long way from our islands, but we must find ourselves content. Being able to sail safely west, to America, is a crucial part of our safety. One cannot guarantee that the Pacific Sea will be safe for our ships forever. We must go to Africa, to keep the West passage safe."
 OFN.17.a:0 "Ship a'hoy!"

 OFN.18.t:0 ">WAR PARTY< gets funding from America"
 OFN.18.desc:0 "CIA has sent us funds to make more propaganda, we will be able to use this for several goals, including: building support for the war and increase our popularity."
 OFN.18.a:0 "Thanks, America"

 OFN.19.t:0 "Factory Owner Wants to Sell a Factory to Us "
 OFN.19.desc:0 "A steel magnate has come to our government and suggested that he can sell us one of his factories for a cheap price, the factory is soon to be outdated, and he has other projects going on anyways. Think of it as his support for the war effort. There will be needed some funds to update the equipment and production lines, but more production is sorely needed for our men down in Africa."
 OFN.19.a:0 "Thanks, but no thanks"
 OFN.19.b:0 "Yes, please"
