 COG_The_Fatherland_Arrives:0 "조국이 도착하다"
 COG_The_Fatherland_Arrives_desc:0 "Now that the Reich has been able to overcome its domestic issues, it can once again begin to project its might abroad. Despite a crumbling empire, Germania finally took notice of the mess this outer reach of the Reich has been experiencing. For the Reichskommissariats, this albeit delayed timing could not have been more opportune, as the German colonial domains were forced to stand off alone against the OFN. Aid requested ages ago has finally started to arrive. Although German forces arrive in an officially defensive capacity, and will prove to be of little help in any conventional warfare, we may rest assured that we will not be left to crumble as the OFN blasts away at our walls."
 COG_Conscripted_Natives:0 "현지인 징집"
 COG_Conscripted_Natives_desc:0 "Müller's previous leniency regarding the conscription of natives into the army of Zentralafrika has now been replaced with strict orders for all able men to support the Reichskommissariat in its bitter war against South Africa. Questions of why this measure was not implemented beforehand in order to better prepare Müller's forces were skilfully deflected by the Reichskommissar. He preferred to instead highlight how these new forces would not just be unmotivated rabble but rather highly motivated divisions eager to earn a palatable wage. They would also be fighting intensely for their homeland, as Müller had decreed if the war was waged successfully then the natives would be allowed further autonomy in the ruling of their lands."
 COG_Conscripted_Mercenaries:0 "Conscripted Mercenaries"
 COG_Conscripted_Mercenaries_desc:0 "Müller has decided to allow the various mercenary companies roaming the Reichskommissariat to officially join the German forces. Deeming their strength necessary to bolster the capabilities Zentralafrika could muster, he proclaimed that all those who were ready to submit would enjoy higher pay and better equipment to continue doing what they loved. In response a number of mercenary leaders have raised the issue of this limiting the liberty that they currently enjoyed in fighting for who and where they wanted. The Reichskommissar in return has promised that this opportunity would only be a temporary one which could only benefit both sides."

 COG_Up_to_Date_Maps:0 "Up-to-Date Maps of Southern Africa"
 COG_Up_to_Date_Maps_desc:0 "Following the tradition of the old Prussian army of forcing junior officers with little personal wealth into topography, we have used officer recruits in our mission of gaining a greater insight into the strategic landscape of the southern part of the continent. The maps they produced on their aerial sorties have helped to establish the positions of vital infrastructure, and landmarks useful in tactical deployment. At the outbreak of the war the mission brief was expanded to include the mapping of troop positions, further adding to the tactical edge provided by this exercise."
 COG_Cameroon_Defense_Plan:0 "Cameroon Defense Plan"
 COG_Cameroon_Defense_Plan_desc:0 "The South African war has taken most of the attention and military resources which Zentralafrika has been able to muster in its colonial domain. Yet certain elements around Müller have warned of the danger posed by exposing the Reichskommissariat to the menace posed by the neighbour in the north-west. They have argued that it was likely that Cameroon could use the apparent weakness of the heartlands to seize the resource rich region. Hence, high command has devised a contingency plan to avoid this "knife in the back", hiding the secret capabilities from the northern neighbour."
 COG_Mullers_Army_0:0 "Müller's Army"
 COG_Mullers_Army_0_desc:0 "The Reichskommissar has been very careful and methodical in the structuring of his armed forces. Believing in the primacy of land warfare and infantry in securing tactical advantages and ultimately victory in Africa, he has pursued a strong propaganda campaign not only targeted at the soldiery but also at the wider Reichskommissariat population and administration. The action had the intended effect of focusing military efforts into this area but also the unintended one that the Zentralafrikaner Heer now had the nickname of "Müller 's Army" due to his patronage."

 COG_Zentralafrikaner_Military_Complex_0:0 "Zentralafrikaner Military Complex"
 COG_Zentralafrikaner_Military_Complex_0_desc:0 "The industrial capacity of the Reichskommissariat has always been lacking due to poor management and resource exports to the Reich. In these times it was necessary however to at least have the production for the necessary requirements of modern warfare. Müller in his awareness of equipment scarcity has pushed for the repurposing of civilian factories to produce simple war materiel like ammunition and small parts required for the maintenance of guns and cars."

 COG_Air_Training_Programs:0 "Air Training Programs"
 COG_Air_Training_Programs_desc:0 "The Zentralafrikaner air warfare capabilities are a joke in comparison to its southern neighbour. Yet the Reichskommissariat could not reliably just rely on its allies and in order to effectively support its focus on land warfare needed certain means. Müller has decided to relay this task to Rolf Steiner, who with the mission briefing of creating air forces capable of providing ground support and helicopter warfare, has gone on to expand and reform the fledgling Zentralafrikaner air capabilities."
 COG_Aerian_Logistics:0 "Aerian Logistics"
 COG_Aerian_Logistics_desc:0 "Steiner's reforms have allowed for Reichskommissariats air forces to provide a whole new dimension to the South African war. Logistical advancements in plane technology now allows the Zentralafrikanischen air forces to fly further without having to turn around and refuel. This has allowed for more complicated missions to support ground forces to be planned and executed."

 COG_Airfield_Developments_0_desc:0 "Steiner has appealed to Müller to be allowed to divert some of Zentralafrika's industrial capacity to expand the airfields situated in the Reichskommissariat. Pleading with colonial overlord, the air reformer reasoned that Zentralafrika was at risk of receiving negative attention from the Reich if reports of the comparative air capabilities of the Zentralafrika and Südwestafrika would reach the desks of Germania. Not wanting to lose his privileged position to some desk drivel back home, he agreed and immediately set about reconfiguring a number of factories."

Hire_Belgian_Mercenaries_tt:0 "The Belgians, who owned this land before us, are by far the most numerous of the foreign settlers. They also bring decades of experience in counter-insurgency operations in the region. Hiring them will certainly improve both our manpower and our defensive capabilities, as well as making them more favorable to our rule."

Hire_Anglo_Mercenaries_tt:0 "The English, though they are certainly the smallest of the foreign settlers, would bring dozens of trucks in addition to an already solid equipment base. Hiring them will certainly increase the speed and supply capability of our divisions, as well as improving relations with the English community."

Hire_French_Mercenaries_tt:0 "The French, the second-most numerous of the foreign settlers, have stockpiled hundreds of guns, making them the best-armed of the mercenaries. Hiring them will allow us to improve on our attacking and reconnaissance capabilities, as well as improving our standing with their community."

Hire_Native_Mercenaries_tt:0 "Native mercenaries are the lowest quality of any option we have available, usually having little training or equipment, and would bring nothing special to the table for us. However, they are by far the most numerous of any group, and hiring their units would reduce tension with the massive native community."

Suppress_Internal_Dissent_tt:0 "The native community is growing increasingly angry with the current state of affairs. This anger, if left unchecked, could spiral out of control quickly and seriously threaten our administration, our lives, and our profits- and losing any of those would be a death sentence for the colony. It's time to give the mercs we've hired a taste of action."

Encourage_Oil_Well_Production_tt:0 "Keeping our investors pleased is a top priority for the colony, and a surefire way of doing that is through increased oil production. The workers at the oil wells are already working hard, but they will certainly work harder with a gun poking into their back. Of course, while this will please our investors greatly, the native community will not take being forced to work even harder than they already do lightly."

Police_The_Plantations_tt:0 "Another solid way to improve the investors opinion of us is to increase rubber exports. Rubber is already being made day in and day out by thousands of slaves, but perhaps sending our mercenaries to "aid with morale" will make them work a little harder. However, though the increased exports will certainly endear us to our investors, it will anger the already overworked native populace greatly."

Guard_Construction_Projects_tt:0 "Our investors spend much time on Zentralafrika, and one of the ways they do it is through construction- of roads, factories, docks, and just about anything else that helps turn a profit. However, these sites are vulnerable to attack, sabotage, and theft. By sending mercenaries to guard these sites, we will sacrifice some manpower we could use later, but our investors will certainly be pleased, and perhaps we'll see some new infrastructure coming out of it."

Encourage_Mining_Operations_tt:0 "One of the main ways our investors make a profit is the vast mineral wealth of Zentralafrika, as tons of diamonds, coal, gold, and numerous other valuable resources are hauled out of the ground and shipped across the world. Production is already high, but sending mercenaries to help encourage production will certainly increase it by a good amount. This move will undoubtedly please our investors, but it will certainly anger the native workers greatly."

Sell_Equipment_To_The_Belgians_tt:0 "The Belgians, though they are the most numerous of the foreign settlers, are poorly equipped in terms of arms. Many still carry outdated rifles from the Second World War, and some even carry bolt-action weapons from the Great War. By selling them modern arms, we will endear ourselves greatly to them, and will definitely see a hefty payday."

Sell_Equipment_To_The_French_tt:0 "The French do not require much in the way of armaments, but there is always room for improvement. Their weapons, though numerous, are almost all at least a few years out of date. By selling them modern German guns, we will certainly improve our standing with them, and may get some good cash out of it as well."

Sell_Equipment_To_The_English_tt:0 "The English, in general, do not need much of our aid. They are generally well armed, and their trucks are quite up to date. However, everything breaks down eventually, and British trucks are no exception, By selling them new, shiny, modern trucks with parts to spare, we will most likely see their opinion of us improve."

Sell_Equipment_To_The_Natives_tt:0 "Selling equipment to the natives is a risky business. Their loyalty is quite questionable- it's likely we'll find at least some of these guns being fired at us eventually. They also will not be able to pay much for these guns. However, the natives are currently extremely underarmed, and their effectiveness in the field would certainly improve. Besides, selling guns to them would show we trust them, and that alone would make them willing to work with us for a while longer."

Ask_Investors_to_produce_Small_Arms_tt:0 "One thing that Zentralafrika is never in surplus of is arms. Weapons are constantly being sold, traded, lost, stolen, and broken. These have combined to leave us with quite the weapons shortage. By asking our investors to produce small arms for us, we can perhaps make headway on this issue, though making requests of our corporate friends is never popular among them."

Ask_Investors_To_Produce_Motorized_Equipment_tt:0 "Working trucks can be hard to come by in Zentralafrika. The jungle is not a conducive environment for any complex mechanism, and trucks are no exception. If we wish to gain trucks for our forces, we will need to ask our investors to produce some for us, even if it will frustrate them."

Ask_Investors_To_Produce_Tanks:0 "Tanks are an important part of any army, but they are tough to come by in the jungles of Africa. Recent efforts have left us with a large deficit of armor- something we must make up quickly if we wish for our armored units to be effective. To do this, we must ask for our benefactors to build tanks for us- a necessary move, but one that will cause much grumbling among them."

Ask_Investors_to_Raise_Steel_Quotas:0 "Steel is a crucial metal for any industrial nation, and ours is no exception. With the increasing amount of factories coming online, so comes an increase in demand that current supply cannot keep pace with. We must ask our investors to raise their steel quotas on their workers- a move that will cause much anger, but a necessary one."

Ask_Investors_to_Raise_Rubber_Quotas:0 "Rubber is the lifeblood of Zentralafrika, and is needed for any of our vehicles to be able to move. However, as demand increases, supply has not, and now we are running a shortage. If we want to fix this, we must ask the investors to increase rubber quotas- an unpopular ask, but one we need if we want to keep our cars and tanks rolling."

Ask_Investors_to_Finance_Civil_Industry:0 "As important as our military industry is, civil industry is a crucial part of any nation's economy. Unfortunately, the civilian industry of Zentralafrika is sorely lacking. By asking the companies to build more factories specializing in consumer goods, we can increase our civil industry, though asking the companies to pay for anything is a surefire way to greatly anger them."

Ask_Investors_to_Fund_Arms_Production:0 "Despite the numerous military factories we have regularly pumping out weapons, it is still not enough to satisfy all of our needs. If we wish to be able to consistently produce, sell, and use weapons all at once, we must increase our arms production capabilities. The investors can certainly help us with this, though asking for them to pay for any of our developments is an extremely unpopular motion."

Ask_Investors_to_Fund_Research_Project:0 "To stay ahead of our enemies, the Reich must keep its technical advantage. Zentralafrika, unfortunately, does not enjoy the same level of educational prowess that Germany itself does. We must gain additional funding for our projects, and the investors are a prime source for it- even if they will undoubtedly protest our asking."

Ask_Investors_to_Finance_Our_Developments:0 "With new lands cleared come new opportunities, but the money we need does not. New space is open for development, but funding is still not available. Therefore, we must procure funding from our investors to build a new factory on our new land, even if such a request angers them. It's simple, really."

In fact, it seems as if the other two we don't choose will be disappointed at the lost opportunity- though we only need one.

Truly, we are the pride of Afrika! In every sense of the word..."

However, even he knows that he has obligations to fulfill, therefore he has found a productive - and lucrative - way to secure both his position and his fun: he has declared his Reichskommissariat a "corporate-friendly" administration, leaving German and former Belgian entrepreneurs the chance to seize all resources in the former Congo basin.\n\nIn exchange for being given free rein, the corporates pay him handsomely: part of this money is sent to Germania as part of his obligation as a colonial administrator, paradoxically making him the most productive Afrikaner Reichskommissar, while the rest goes to fund his love for hunting. While indeed clever, this means that the colonial bureaucracy has become a de facto extension of the corporations..."

The logical consequence of this, is that Zentralafrikan ports are the closest to the mainland Reich, making us the Afrikaner trade hub!\n\nWhile this means lots and lots of money flowing into our colonial coffers, it also means that we have the duty to maintain the large dockyard facilities dotting our short coastline: if the diamond trade were to suddenly halt due to malfunctioning loading cranes, Müller would experience a new kind of hunt, one where he's the prey, and the hunter has an atomic arsenal..."

Of course, we know that he is a poor excuse for a mafioso, constantly threatening us with the shutdown of all Belgian activities if we don't grant them tax exemptions and other benefits, but even he knows that he can't ask for too much, or risk losing everything should we run out of patience.\n\nThis stalemate has translated into an informal agreement: every year, Schramme and Müller meet in person and discuss the extent of the benefits the Belgians will enjoy, and what the expatriates will give to the Reich in exchange for the favour treatment.

We don't even bother with salutes anymore. Wild adoration and gushing over the year's biggest conquests are more popular than military icons, perhaps because Müller and his men cannot run after swastikas or flags and shoot them down. If you described to me how my career here would go the day before I departed for the Congo, I would have laughed in your face: and yet here I am, so weary of it all I cannot breathe, but this mad laughter bubbles up in my throat and I cannot contain it.\n\nAnyway, the Triumph Parade. Tomorrow at noon the clocks will ring all over Leopoldville and a series of large trucks, garnished in camouflage decoration so scandalous it would be cause for military trial back home, will ride down the Führer Avenue. Large cutouts will display the biggest hunts of the year, elephants, monkeys, the occasional giraffe for when Müller's gaze strays to Kenya: and TV screens will blare out this insane circus-show to all who care to see it. In fact, I am told it is mandatory viewing in government offices, which would also explain why the office is so empty this time of year.\n\nAnd this, Ingall, this is the worst part: The last part of the parade is not animal, but human. Filthy tribesmen they saw fit to capture. Some of them will still be healthy enough to release when the parade is over - but some will not. And I can still see the bloodstains from last year when I collide my eyes.

This was the face of the Reichskommissariat to the rest of the world, the first-and often only-sight that foreigners who came to the colonies had of life inside Zentralafrika.\n\nAnd come they did. In the deepwater piers of the Pointe, flags from around the world could be seen. Most of the smaller ships that plied the canals, moving goods over the locks between the deepwater port and the Kongo Meer, were locally owned. However, some oddities abound; a fleet of small Swiss-flagged ivory haulers here, three Swedish river cruise ships there. Conspicuously absent were the Belgian flags that once dominated the river steamers, though many of their vessels (and even the crews) were largely unchanged. The cargoes they unloaded were much the same too, but every day the destination was different, from Valparaiso to Vladivostok and everywhere in between. There were the usual Pakt freighters of course, and the ex-Belgians eagerly awaited the arrival of every vessel from the French State-each potentially laden with a whisper of home. Today a Brazilian reefer ship might dock; tomorrow an Argentine Ro-Ro ship. Even the frigid trade embargoes among the major power blocs was no impediment, it was easy to find a "Panamanian" or "Liberian" flagged ship owned by an American company, or an Indian flagged vessel controlled by a Japanese front.\n\nAs these strangers arrived, they saw slowly meandering currents where once mighty rivers had been, and orderly lines of palatial villas where naught but foreboding jungle had stood. And just as the Reich had tamed the wilderness, it seemed that commerce had tamed the Reich. With the ports of Zentralafrika opened, the world breathed a collective sigh of hope that the hyper-expansionist Reich of old had committed to a brighter, more peaceful, and more profitable future."

His body was frail and failing, befitting his twilight years, but the brillance of his triumphal grin was matched only by the radiance of the sunrise in the background. The architect at the heart of the Atlantropa project was gazing out upon the Kwamouth Dam. The scene was serene and peaceful; a master craftsman basking in the glory of his brainchild, a symbol of Germania's technical triumph.\n\nThey say a picture is worth a thousand words. This one wasn't worth the canvas it was painted on.\n\nIn reality, construction of the dam, and the series of locks for ships over top of it, had been slow and painstaking. While the leading architects of the Reich labored in Germania or luxuriated in the limelight of the Mediterranean constructing the Gibraltar Dam, the remedial students were sent to a virtual exile in this ungodly hot, malaria-ridden shithole. Progress was slow, mistakes were frequent and often fatal. Native workmen from the flooded zones were forcibly relocated to work on the project. Many dropped dead from exhaustion; those who evaded capture or deserted found only temporary relief, as the rising waters swallowed the jungle around them. Sörgel himself had rarely visited; even before his death, most of his more expansive African projects had been abandoned. There was to be no irrigation of the Sahara, or Berlin to Cape Town Railway. For the natives, like their Mediterranean counterparts, Atlantropa had brought no improvements to their quality of life: only displacement, pain, and death.\n\nNot so for the engineers. Despite the setbacks, the initial dam provided a vast amount of hydroelectricity, and a navigable waterway to connect the brand new Kongo Meer-the great Congo Sea-to the ocean. The profits from these projects were enormous. Looked down on by their peers in Europe and flush with cash, the construction team turned their minds to constructing Hitlersstadt: a planned resort community on one of the new islands in the sea. It was meant for the upper echelons of the Reich...or at least those willing to brave the trip out here. And, of course, the place was meant for them, a new home far away from their pasts. Today, as their colleagues in Europe desperately struggled to maintain the failing Mediterranean dams and please their increasingly fickle masters, the Kwamouth team kick up their feet in their new beachfront villas, watching their kickbacks rise with each passing merchant ship that sails by."

The palm oil will find its way into the kitchens and bakeries of the world, netting the Belgian company that farms it and the Reichskommissariat a healthy sum of money.\n\nNot all of the land is going to be used to produce goods. In Bumba, a lodging concern has decided to directly compete with Hitlerstadt and provide their own accommodations, utilizing the nearby Buta airport to bring in travelers from around the world. They have purchased a massive swath of beach there, as well as a few outlying islands. There, they will place hotels, motels, resorts, vacation homes, timeshares, anything to cater to the expected massive throngs of people who seek a tropical and exotic destination.\n\nIt seems Zentralafrika has found a use for the large amount of land that exists on the east side of the Congo Lake. And that use seems to be "whatever the Belgians want with it." It doesn't matter, as they get far more money from selling it than just sitting on it. And in the end, everybody's happy with these arrangements."

 COG_focus.7.desc:0 "Every year for the past half-decade we have played a simple tango with the Reichskommissar Hüttig. We offer to set up a common market with Ostafrika and Südwestafrika. Schenck, of course, has agreed, because sane men agree to a mutually advantageous proposition. Hüttig, of course, turns us down every single time, because why would he? A common market would imply a free market, and God knows Hüttig doesn't want freedom anywhere near his precious colony.\n\nIn any case, Rolf Steiner is insistent that we try again, and so we shall: but with no hope of success. Prepare a table, Hüttig, it's time to dance again, and let us assure you - we are not impressed with your footwork, no matter how consistent it is. We send a pissed-off representative and a dead-eyed adjutant to play this year's dance, and we offer the usual terms. The same pursed-lips Ostafrikan bureaucrat offers the same response from the same table: Unless Ostafrika is given special terms that essentially negate the "common" part of the market, the deal is off the table.\n\nThe representative, in his report, notes that the quality of the alcohol offered him has declined over the past 7 years. He has offered to bring it up at the next meeting, in the hopes of actually accomplishing something useful. We politely decline: Hüttig would probably respond by banning alcohol altogether, and if that were to happen, well, we wouldn't want a representative to try hanging himself over diplomatic minutiae. We can barely deal with Hüttig intoxicated - we cannot imagine dealing with him sober."

He had no time to play observer or cameraman: today's flight would end at a destination he'd never seen before, and at coordinates he was unfamiliar with. Tapping the gauges of his fuel meter (they never found the last one who found his tank empty over the Lake) he prepared himself to fly from the vast expanse of Windhoek to a nameless field in Zentralafrika.\n\nHe was, frankly, quite surprised when the request filtered in from headquarters: Müller was far more preoccupied with aerial vehicles he could aim from, so why bother investing in a substantial Air Force at all? He supposed even a man as headstrong as the Reichskommissar wasn't immune to fears of natives simply shooting him out of the sky as he played hunter atop a helicopter. Either way, as one of the senior airmen in the Südwestafrikan force he'd been sent as a show of goodwill. And also a convenient gesture towards retirement, in all probability.\n\nBut this was no time for speculation. He went over maneuvers and training patterns he could dredge up from the depths of his mind and past, techniques learned in distant Germany half a lifetime ago. There would be little rest from this point onwards: now he had a class to teach, and if the reports sent from Léopoldville were accurate, it would be the largest single class he'd ever taught. He just wished they'd pay him more for babysitting."

This has resulted in a more or less half-empty city, with the occasional expatriate-driven automobile a rare sight on the weekday and an occasional sight on the weekend. But today the streets heading south are packed: Leopoldville Airport is opening an expansion for civilian and military usage.\n\nMüller himself has volunteered to lead the opening ceremony, although his mildly bored expression suggests that he's begun to regret that decision. He begins by making a short speech about how Zentralafrika's development has always been reliant on the benevolence of the greater Reich, and how their leadership has lit the way for all citizens of Leopoldville and the German Congo to follow. It's clear he's reading off a script, and without much enthusiasm.\n\nThen he segues into describing the civilian applications of the airport, and soon it's clear that the ceremony will last far beyond the initial hour. He regales the audience with tales of how his gunships have given him the platform to hunt down nearly every type of beast in the Congo, and soon pivots to his favourite gauntlet of hunting trips, including that time he nearly ended up dead by the hooves of a feared white rhino on a trip to Italian East Africa (his aides have heard this story so many times there is an office pool on the time of its next retelling). As the audience begins to nod off in boredom, an aide hurriedly ushers him off the stage, reminds the audience to sign a Reichskommissariat-Donation pledge on the way out, and declares the airport officially reopened."

Sometimes, it was best to only let military men talk if they wanted. And from what little he heard from them, he could understand why.\n\nNot to say the guest didn't talk as they drove in the Porsche down the dusty road from Léopoldville to Cabinda. He did ask a few questions about the new pipeline that accompanied them on the way. How much could it transport, how long was it, and how thick were the walls. Once he asked about if wildlife was heavily impacted by the pipeline. And how deep it was under the ground.\n\nStill, the owner had no idea what the guest wanted from this trip. He figured that it was another investor wanting to put his money into one of the few bright spots of the Pakt Economy. And he had those before. Occasionally, he tried to put in a pitch about the profitability of the venture, and where to possibly buy stocks or bonds in the associated companies.\n\nThe guest wasn't interested.

Rumors are that the mansion was built with the finest architects in Germania, and a prodigious amount of local labor, labor which the owner paid for himself. Müller's only problem with it is that there are fewer trophy heads displayed on its walls than he would like: but Jean 'Blackjack' Schramme, planter, Belgian representative and real-estate magnate, is not a man whose tastes stoop to mere hunting.\n\nMüller meets with Schramme on one of the secluded bungalows off the edge of the estate: taking care of a little signature for a tax agreement is not something he normally does in person, but he'd be lying if he wasn't at least a little awed and jealous of Schramme. So he makes small talk with Schramme (who is, of course, the very image of polite acquiescence - he didn't get to the top of the cut-throat politics of the Belgian expatriate community through sloppy bearing) and passes him, at an appropriate time, a paper confirming Belgian loyalty, ownership limits and tax revenue.\n\nSchramme is a businessman above all else, and he urges Müller to lighten the load of a class that is, after all, a key part of the resource extraction operation here. Who else could control the truckloads of jewels and mineral wealth coming out of the Basin each day? But even the most powerful businessman in the Congo knows he cannot long resist the Reich, no matter how far away, and eventually he signs after some minor haggling.

Heh, I think one day I'll train my boys and my closest men to follow in my footsteps, you know? Always hunting, always keeping fit, keeping lean! Hahahaha! Anyway, I think we might use them for defensive efforts too, but Gott, I sound so boring when I talk like a stuffed-up general, don't you think? Anyway, come join us on our next hunt!

 COG_focus.13.desc:0 "The Congo Lake is the heart of Zentralafrika, a gargantuan lake that serves as the beating heart of our colony. The endless jungles of the continent make moving anything overland an impossible proposition, for the few roads that exist have a tendency to turn into seas of mud or landfills of IEDs planted by local rebels. It's thus inevitably a better proposal to move thing over the lake, where shipping lanes are carefully monitored by the Zentralafrika Coast Guard for piratical activity.\n\nAreas otherwise inaccessible can thus be developed using the overwater route. To tap into new sectors, it becomes necessary to clear areas for piers and docks on the far reaches of the Congo lake. Survey teams are sent to find areas where the soil can resist best the erosion of industrial activity. A bunch of locals are then shanghaied into clearing the forest at gunpoint. Any precious wood is usually saved for later, while the rest is used to build the piers, given to plantations in need of firewood or simply burned. Auctioning to shipping companies the right to transport the tropical wood is a source of under the table income used to grease the wheel both in zentralafrika and abroad.\n\nWith the docks built, the first to show up are some form of security apparatus. Sometimes soldiers or African "volunteers", more often some mixture of mercenary and private security forces working for whatever private interests has bought stakes in the new development. These men with guns fan out into the jungle and assess the level of danger to any operation. Afterwards the usual gaggle of geologists, engineers and scientists stream in to note what can be found in the area that can be carted off abroad for profits. A few ecologists are allowed to operate, mostly to keep Reichskommissar informed of new exciting creatures to hunt."

It was the annual Mercenary's summit in Léopoldville, where supplies, recruits, and new contracts could be had. Corporate alliances were made and broken, shady deals were the order of the day. But Müller's gala always ruled the night. Yesterday, many of these men were at each other's throats, ready to kill for a few dollars more. Today, they laughed and smoked and drank like the best of friends, swapping tales of their time in the bush. There stood "Mad Mike" Hoare in his tiger-stripe camo ascot and slouch hat, that old Anglo twit; master of the pen and the Thompson gun alike. An eruption of laughter echoed forth from the gaggle of Belgians; Goosens the fat bastard, rich Schramme in his ridiculous velvet tuxedo and a trademark beret, fresh from his vast estate; Crevecoeur up to his eyeballs in liquor and delusions of glory from climbing the corporate ladder. One Belgian stood apart, however; Jimmy Vogeleer, with his sunken eyes and expressionless stare, chomping on an ivory pipe. At his side was Bob Denard, the mysterious Frenchmen; crafty, silent, sizing up the congregation of fresh new faces.\n\nThat's where Müller could always be found. He always found the conversation stale among the grizzled old vets. His every word was analyzed, every gesture placed under a microscope; each mercenary wondering whether some inflection in the Reichskommissioner's voice signaled a secret deal with their rivals. But most of this young blood couldn't give a shit; many wouldn't live to see next year's gala. They had the fire of youth, a passion for life's finest things, a taste for danger, flamboyant fashions, and the hunt; in short everything that Siegfried Müller lived for. And besides, every year he bet with Steiner bet on who would live and who would die in the coming year. After hours of drinking, Müller finally picked his favorite: a young Afrikaner who would only introduce himself as "Duck." But that was tomorrow's concern. Tonight, they would raise a glass to each other, to Zentralafrikas, and to some bloody good wars in the year ahead."

Mixed with the smoke, it looked like the palace was on fire. And considering what happened next, it might as well have been.\n\nBon Denard was the first to rise. He ashed his cigarette and walked out of the room, laughing the whole way. Mike Hoare rose next, but-much to everyone's surprise-moved forward to shake Müller's hand. "You dirty harlot, you fucking traitor! They're our own people!" roared Duck Van Der Linde, the young South African. Hoare chuckled, "We're defending your people, you stupid Afrikaner-and killing mine. It's what the degenerates deserve, thinking the black is equal to the white. And last time I checked, we're both Zentralafrikans now. Think about which way the wind is blowing, kid." While the Anglos warred in English, a similar argument played out in French. Goosens, the hot-headed Belgian, asking how his compatriots could march with SS divisions to conquer another people considering the Burgundian occupation of La Patrie. Crevecoeur and Schramme calling him a coward as they thought of their vast estates and suddenly-bright prospects of accelerating their climbs up the corporate ladder.\n\nMüller couldn't keep track of the polyglot conversations swirling about him. It was becoming increasingly clear he couldn't keep track of much of anything. When the dust settled, some of the mercenaries remained, committed to money above all else. But more than he'd hoped had showed some principles after all and disappeared back into their own private wars."

He sighed when he was done and wished the officer cadre much luck as his aides eagerly took the last of their notes. Then, he went to the assembled high command and called his aides in the endeavor to his side.\n\n"I actually shouldn't have to do this with every single one of our units. There are simply too many and the frontlines are very demanding. However, it seems there is no other way." He looked at one of his aides and grabbed for the documents he was holding gingerly. Müller opened the folder of the review and ran through the lines with his finger. "That is already the third consecutive company that is lacking in more than a dozen occasions equipment-wise and hasn't conducted proper officer training in more than a year!"\n\nGeneral Bormann shamefully looked at his feet, Mulamba took on a concerned look, and Steiner protectively crossed his arms in front of his chest. Only Wilhelm von Thoma dared to speak. "A shameful display indeed. I have always been begging the Generalbüro for a proper review of the forces by an apt representative of yours."\n\nMüller cut him off angrily. "I didn't ask for your opinion." He took a turn on his heels as the next unit assembled in front of him, neatly prepared by their commanding officers. "We have so many of them!" He took a glance behind.

Apparently this view of the defensive line from the helicopter was a good one for him. But Steiner was looking at this from another angle. "I don't know if it's enough, to be honest," he said, betting Müller would be in a good enough mood to not go after him for that statement. "They are pretty sparse and spread out..."\n\nMüller laughed. "Oh, it's plenty. The landscape isn't that great to transverse anyway. And we'll have a bunch of outside circumstances that will work in our favor."\n\n"Outside circumstances? What do you-"\n\n"Think strategically, dumbass!" laughed Müller. "We have all of Barotseland between the South Africans and us, and the terrain is poor there as well. By the time they run into us, these fortifications will convince them to fuck off and attack the other two. They have larger fronts anyway. Preferably they attack Hüttig. Schenck doesn't need the trouble."\n\n"But should we expand it, sir?" asked Steiner. "We still have territory out near Leopoldville that needs to be defended..."\n\n"If they get near Leopoldville, Südwestafrika's fucked and the war's as good as lost." Müller picked up a rifle.

He glanced at his accomplices in the matter of planning the war. Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma to his left, proudly displaying his spotless olive green uniform with all those redundant medals. Rolf Steiner directly to his opposite, thoughtfully scratching his chin. "Certainly", Müller began flipping the pen between his hands, "we all agree that the only way to win this war is concentrating our infantry at the front lines. Here." He tapped the pen on the map. "And here." Another tap.\n\n"I abnegate, Reichskommissar", von Thoma stood up, adjusting his stainless uniform. "While these positions may be wisely chosen, I out of all those present can produce the most logical approach." He peered over his two witnesses. "Mind me saying this, but the Panzertruppe will be key to our victory! You are obviously forgetting about northern Africa so lightheartedly, just because it wasn't your glory." He smirked to himself. "The only means we should feasibly apply is the Panzer. Reliable, unrelenting..."\n\nSteiner coughed, cutting von Thoma off. "Yes, we have heard your ramblings all over again. We know they are swift and efficient. They were key to our victory, and crewed by able men they are deadly war machines. Well, well. But have you seen our arsenal. It's still the same generation you used in northern Africa. I propose we use helicopters instead." He went to the balcony, opening the curtains to reveal the great helicopter in the yard. "They are everything a Panzer is but better!"\n\nMüller took a miniature helicopter, sweeping it across the map of Africa. "They are undeniably good for hunting, but those things weren't built for wars. Men are built for wars. They are reliable and efficient, just give the right man a rifle and the wonder unfolds." He took the miniature of a soldier and deployed it at the South African border.\n\nThis was just the beginning of a verbal battle, dragging on late into the night.

But this time the Reichskommissar was determined to get a decision, before the arguing developed into the battlefield of a drunkard again.\n\nVon Thoma paced through the office, his uniform having become shaggy in the last days. "Panzers, my friends! Why won't you just accept this? They are reliable, unrelenting..."\n"No!" Müller and Steiner exclaimed in unison.\n"Why not?" Von Thoma wanted to know. It was like they rejected him out of pure concept.\n\n"Have me say it again", Müller cornered him, "a Panzer is nothing without infantry, but infantry is enough without a Panzer. Probably they are better off even, considering the Panzers we have at disposal" He stared at the map. "I keep on with it. There and there! A huge concentration of infantry and they will be wavering within the day!"\n\n"Siegfried, you love your helicopters." He sounded pleading. "Base our strategy upon them and the enemy will be unable to counter our swift strikes!"\nVon Thoma and Steiner argued on why their means was the best as a strategy to defeat the South Africans and possibly the Americans, respectively. The Reichskommissar, meanwhile, went to take his old Karabiner from the retainers at the wall. They didn't even notice that he aimed at them, going from one to the other.\n\nA shot. Splinters flew. A glass spilled on the table and the map. Müller hit the table. He took all his zeal and started to exclaim in a voice, deep and strong yet coarse from all the arguing. "This is what we ought to be doing! Fucking shooting at the enemy! We obviously can't agree on how to organize the shooting! So, for now just stick with shooting at all! We'll see soon enough which strategy will win us the war! But therefore we have to fight after all! The rest will be discussed then! Now out with you, those were clear enough orders!"

He wanted to breathe the fresh and electricizing air of action and excitement. He wanted to repurpose his vigor on the battlefield, not the minor squabbles of words and logistics. For the last time before setting off to his new task, with the excitement of a child, he made sure his orders were understood.\n\nGoing off to war had been easier when he was a nobody. Now he had to fill many papers and soothe his bureaucrat's nerves. He told them that, in case of his death on the battlefield, Rolf Steiner is the man in charge until the squabbling forces in Germania decide on a new Reichskommissar to take his place. Whenever that may be.\nHe took Steiner in a brotherly embrace and wished him all the luck. Steiner tried to talk Müller out of his determination, but he just assured he didn't intend to die.\n\nMüller, dressed in a common camouflage uniform instead of a general's, took hold of the retainer in the helicopter. His crew told him, under the spinning of the rotor, how proud they were to fight with their superior, as the helicopter set off. He knew that none of his colleagues down here would do the same, but he couldn't possibly imagine sitting his ass flat on a stool while the fighting rages on without him.\nHe sighed as he was flooded with memories from the Second World War.\n\nBy the time they disembarked, days later, all those memories faded into clear realization: That's what Müller was born for! He readjusted his equipment and went off to the near clamor of war. He ran with his companions towards the smell of blood, jumping over rocks and crashing through the dust as reinforcements all around them did the same, though more hesitant. When he climbed the small mound to oversee the battlefield, a scenery of explosion, cries, shoots, dust, dying soldiers and blood unfolded. He rushed down the mound with a cry of relish and stumbled into the fight with all his zeal.\nHis first kill was a limping South African soldier."

This war, though, was too close to home to ignore, and his bottom line-like his people-was already bleeding red.\n\nThe last thing he needed tonight was a bad fucking party.\n\nFlamboyant as always, Müller bust through the doors dressed in his Safari suit, complete with his leopard print ascot and his resplendently shining Iron Cross. Yet looking out around the crowd, all he saw were grey suits and dour faces. A sigh escaped his lips. He had wanted to relax tonight; to get away from the stream of bad news coming from the front. Instead, he'd have to work. He smiled his way to the bar where he ordered himself a drink, all the while examining the crowd. What he saw was little different than a hunt on the verge of collapse. The pack of prey had seen him and eyed his every move now. He had to be careful, for the slightest misstep could spoil the game. He would only have one shot to take-one chance to rectify the problem before clients started to withdraw.\n\nThere was no sense going for the Belgians; they had nowhere else to turn, and their fates were tied with his. They knew it, as did he. It was the foreigners who were the real prize. He swirled and danced and smoked and drank among them all; Kinushima-san, Herr Schnerr, Mademoiselle Bongler from Geneva. Wherever Müller went, gaiety and laughter followed in his wake. There had always been violence and resistance: what's a tad bit more? The Kongolese system was built to contain it! Who else could say that? After all, this little fuss was nothing compared to the horrors back home, in Europe or Asia! Slowly but surely, the evening picked up steam until it was just like old times-that is, of course, except for Mr. Smith.\n\nAs Müller approached, the American refused to shake his hand. "Ah, my friend, I think you're in need of a gift!" Müller spat in his rehearsed English. With a snap of his fingers, a native SS man walked in toward the pair carrying a domed dish. When he arrived, Müller encouraged Smith to lift it with a grin. Soon, Smith was smiling too, for the papers inside were worth more than their weight in gold. Shipping labels, bearing legitimate South African customs markings: just enough to move his entire shipment of diamonds across the sea to America out of Pointe-Noire...er, Cape Town, of course. Drunk on joy and fine wine, Smith didn't stop to consider the small flecks of blood on the labels, an ugly reminder of how Müller had come to acquire them just a few hours before."

They were still trading goods, including a vast array of raw materials that were sold over Germania's required quota, with the United States. It had always been to the distaste of many in the NSDAP, but most didn't know or simply didn't care as much about Africa as maybe Hans Hüttig did. However, it was time of war now. While the goods weren't necessary for the war effort yet as a certain prime customer of them had just collapsed, there were talks that the US was in dire negotiation to help the South Africans.\n\nMany in the trade affairs office questioned this. Yet not much more, for they also didn't question the presence of generous American investors and companies in the Reichskommissariat. Almost nobody but the stupid green boys did by now. The office wasn't sure of its orders, nonetheless.\n\nToday, Rolf Steiner finally delivered them in person. The trades would go on in the usual manner. The Reichskommissar hoped to appease domestic investors, on the one hand, and diverge foreign aggression, on the other.

He took out a cigarette from his favorite American brand and was glad that the latest shipments brought an extra huge load; not all Zentralafrikan functionaries were particularly glad about the American trade, but sooner or later even the most loyal civil servants would find pleasure in some of the American Schweinehund's goods.\n\nThe smoldering of the cigarette provided the only light for him this early as Hans wondered whether this was necessary. Rolf Steiner himself had visited his insular office in the Generalbüro to make sure the task was understood. Well, there was only one to understand it because of all the administrative entities his office was the most understaffed. It has ever been. When he arrived five years ago, they were two, now it is only him as Gerhard left during the Cameroon Conflicts. Ever since, in fact even before, the Generalbüro never bothered to have enough staff to properly manage the arms inventory.\n\nNow it is all coming back to him thanks to this goddamn war. Now Steiner is shitting his pants about any and every weapon shipment's whereabouts. Now he has to trace all these shipments back, whether from last year or the establishment of the Reichskommissariat doesn't matter. Steiner wants all these documents looked over and an updated list of all available equipment.\n\nAt least he doesn't have to do it all by himself.

In fact, it even stands rivalling the most profitable of the European Reichskommissariats. Next to Hans Hüttig's fiefdom, it is the Zentralafrikan economy is the only one operating in the black, making more than merely respectable profits compared to Ostafrika.\n\nThe many sources the money is generated from as well as the many sources it is sunk into need to be administrated by a huge cadre of able functionaries. Most of the money is, of course, credited to the Reich's account and thus funneled into the coffers of the Reichswirtschaftsministerium in Germania.\n\nHowever, it has been often inquired how the Reichskommissariat makes its profits. In that, it operates similarly to some of the many corporations present. Swaths of the remaining money is put into deals. It is used to accommodate for the needs of potential foreign investors, conducted beyond the Reich's reach. To fulfill the deals money flows into the appeasement of the corporations' interests. In turn, they start operations in the Reichskommissariat, working into sustaining the sub-division for economic affairs as an expanding office. Apart from that the office also undertakes investments known only to the highest echelons of governance. Bribery foremost amongst them.\n\nBut now with a war running, the sub-division needs to restructure for accommodation and money has to be closely tracked as to be properly funneled towards success in the war."

He wasn't present. As always, he had taken off earlier for the weekend. Actually, he took off earlier every day, but for the weekends even earlier. Rolf Steiner entered instead and made some comments about Müller having become very impatient. After releasing the bureaucrats he made himself comfortable in the Reichskommissar's lounge to work through the documents.\n\nThe next day he intercepted Siegfried Müller before flying off to the Congo Lake for a trip. They got into his office and Steiner reviewed the figures for his superior. Just as Müller asked of him, Rolf Steiner devised a new wartime budget to accommodate for the expenses of such a huge war.\n\nHe did even more than was asked of him. His new budgetary plan included a certitude in case the foreign investors and entrepreneurs considered pulling out their investments due to the raging war, which would have brought the old dusty budget to a cataclysmic crumbling.

Numerous of the elder bureaucrats have been heard shouting how they damned this war for not being like the Cameroon Conflicts. Well, damn them; they didn't have to bravely fight on the frontlines back then. But there's some truth in there. Those conflicts didn't suck the profits, once admired by even some of the European Reichskommissars, dry as this war.\n\nYet the war is sucking dry something else, at least it will begin soon. It will suck the manpower pool dry. As there are neither endless hordes of greedy mercenaries nor we have the money to employ them, Steiner quickly dragged Siegfried Müller out of this warrior's fantasy.\n\nFortunately, though, they had lots of men roaming and living in the Congolese jungle. Those men consisted of some sorry conglomerates of rural African settlements, of once employed mercenaries, rogue former soldiers, African and foreign adventurous and surely some fled plantation workers; most likely fled from Hüttig as well. But they had one thing in common: They admired the legendary Warrior of the Jungle, Bob Denard, and are a precious resource we need; manpower.\n\nThus, this man and his commando are the means to this treasure. Denard, however, had refused Müller's orders more often than any other man in Zentralafrika, sometimes making them look like desperate pleas. As such, we must make this proposition lucrative for him as well. We can either promise him an increased pay or award him more freedoms for his commando after the war, for he is still in our service despite his arrogance.\n\nWe must tread carefully. We need him to get to those men. This war may not be decided on the frontlines but by our careful proposition and, unfortunately, Denard's affinity of it."

The Reichskommissar never understood the necessity of enacting this genius plan to effectively tame and dominate the enemy upon her roar.\n\nThe South African War, however, raging ferociously across the continent shifted the odds and our wary border patrols have thinned to effectively consist only of von Blottnitz's unit.

The sole way to get such huge swaths is by working with the many foreign investors already, or potentially, bolstering our coffers.

 COG_focus.44.desc:0 "Wilhelm von Thoma, his chief of staff and some lesser adjutants - all of whom being the highest officers of the Zentralafrikan Panzertruppe - arrived at the Reichskommissar's complex for the scheduled meeting. All of them had donned their finest military garbs with von Thoma having pinned all his medals he'd won in the famed Afrika Korps on his uniform. Though hindered by the cane von Thoma had to use for age-induced reasons, they entered the room in cadence.\n\nNow that the war had shaped into its horrific state due to the prior negligence of the correct strategy, they call up on him again. He shouldn't have come; that's not the way to treat an experienced member of the Afrika Korps. But von Thoma isn't an arrogant man and he is loyal to... his... Reich, besides. His strategy will surely win them the war.\n\nRolf Steiner sat observantly in a corner of the vast room, as von Thoma's lessers laid out the map and began reviewing their Panzer-focused strategy to the Reichskommissar. The general smiled at Steiner, who quickly left the room under loud rambling, and took the word for himself, briskly cutting off his adjutants. Elaborately he explained his plan for the new mobile warfare doctrine centered on Panzers, effectively adjusting Erwin Rommel's overused strategies to a continent-wide scale. Or as von Thoma called it, he 'improved' them.\n\nDespite Steiner's rambling's still ringing in his ears, Müller stayed loyal to his decision and sent von Thoma's clique to the frontline with extensive combat authority."

 COG_focus.45.desc:0 "Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller had donned his common uniform, whether threadbare from his hunts or some battles he couldn't say. For a moment he thought he had forgotten to pin his Iron Cross, but it was pinned on this uniform all the time. He entered the planning room in which Rolf Steiner and Wilhelm von Thoma were exchanging cold looks at each other.\n\nMüller called for an Oberst of the Zentralafrikaner garrison and for Mulamba of the Waffen-SS. They rolled out a map. Mulamba was about to say something when the Oberst roughly pushed him to the side for Müller to proceed. He explained his infantry-based strategy again, elaborated on the roles of the garrison, the native SS and the mercenaries respectively and, finally, reviewed the strategically best positions he had worked out with his staff.\n\nSteiner seemed mildly pleased and thanked the Waffen-SS' representative for his efforts. Von Thoma only nodded at the Oberst and hypocritically congratulated the Reichskommissar on this plan and wished him luck before leaving the room with his adjutants.\n\nMüller, however, smiled at Steiner and told him how hard they had worked on this grand plan. He was happy to finally put it into practice. Steiner tried once again to ask the Reichskommissar not to leave for the frontlines to conduct this strategy for himself, but Müller had none of it."
 COG_focus.45.a:0 "That might just be why he decided on an infantry strategy..."

 COG_focus.46.t:0 "The Steiner Plan"
 COG_focus.46.desc:0 "Rolf Steiner entered the Reichskommissar's office at a swift pace. He wanted to be done with it as soon as possible so that this war might finally be properly handled. Two of his men were trailing along, carrying maps and documents exactly detailing the planned operations down to the tiniest of details. Unsurprisingly, he only found some higher chiefs of staff in the room besides Müller. Wilhelm von Thoma and his clique were provocatively absent.\n\nHowever, it sure made things easier for Steiner. He took his aides' documents and presented them to the Reichskommissar and the other military staff. He neatly laid out every detail of his strategy heavily involving the use of air cavalry, not just as mere transportation but putting it to a wide range of uses. But he was very quick about it not to waste any second.\n\nOnce Müller approved of his plan with a simple and swift nod, much to Steiner's liking, he left the room to prepare his subordinates for putting his strategy to practice at the frontlines. As a minister, he saw himself obliged not to forget his duties in Léopoldville. As such he would mainly be represented by his lessers, while he would only inspect the frontlines when he deemed it necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, Steiner could sense somebody to be seething with rage about his plan being put into action all the while. And days later rumor was spreading at the Oberkommando that Wilhelm von Thoma was preparing to write another book in response to what he perceived as a public shaming: someone in a lesser rank than von Thoma drafting a useful military strategy. And one focused on helicopters rather than tanks or infantry, besides."

 COG_focus.47.desc:0 "Before the collapse of the Reich there used to be an almost reliable influx of supplies in equipment, armaments, and guns. While not the best of what the Fatherland had to offer, it was sufficient mostly for the time being, only taking a huge plummet in quality shortly after the Cameroon Conflicts and the economic debacle at home. Now that times of war, uncertainty, and demise have befallen every corner of the Reich, we stand cornered with the few and shabby we currently have at disposal.\n\nDuring the many logistical and administrative nightmares the Generalbüro found that much of the expected crates from Germania, as per order, had been missing. In reality, many knew before as the appearance of massive swaths of German equipment on the West African black market had not gone unnoticed. Something happened to them on their way to Point-Noire to 'diverge' their route. We might never know. Yet we do know that avoiding prior negligence would have spared this embarrassment. Quite frankly, we have to resolve this logistical stupidity.\n\nFuture equipment shipments, from wherever they might arrive, to sustain our survival in this direst of conflicts must be tracked precisely. We need to avoid any disappearance of supply crates, for if we don't this war might take a dreadful turn."

He was already deep in work, vanishing behind the shadows of the Generalbüro's high-ranking officials and piles of books and papers. The aides could hear him scribble notes while the functionaries spoke and they could hear him mumble commands while daily tasks of the Generalbüro's sub-divisions were decided on. The aides waited for them to leave before greeting their superior and laying down the documents. Rolf Steiner's strained face appeared for a moment of curt appreciation, just to dissolve into a pile of work again.\n\nSteiner never had a problem with taking over from Siegfried Müller when he decided to take short leaves for his personal pleasure. It's always been like this when he was appointed to Zentralafrika and, besides, he felt like he was running most of the Reichskommissriat's many Sisyphean tasks anyways. Those interim-governorships had become more and more common in the last decade, spiking during the Cameroon Conflicts. The currently raging war, however, had opened an entirely new opportunity. He still felt uncomfortable despite Müller's explicit authorization to move into his office and assume full control of the Generalbüro but Steiner wasn't used to being the interim Reichskommissar on paper. Normally, just a few would realize before Müller returned.\n\nYet this time his endeavors at the front - which Steiner isn't particularly fond of - have given him so much time and had to see him amass so much power that when the official decree arrived from the frontlines everyone knew already: the Reichskommissarship had essentially shifted. Steiner didn't like it. He was usually best at doing something when nobody knew he was doing it."

His white knuckles gripped the long black snout of a rifle, pointed towards the great unknown before him.\n\nOnly moments before he had been out on the gravel road, joking with the members of his patrol. The attack had come unexpectedly, and it took only minutes before a chorus of Indigenous screams and broken German shouts overwhelmed their position. One by one, his comrades had fallen, until only Edwin remained, grazed in several places. He had sprinted towards the bush, an adrenaline rampage coursing through his veins.\n\nNow he lay here, nestled in the green, awaiting his fate. He closed his eyes so tight they hurt, trying to expel the shakes from his body. The voices were approaching again, and in the distance he made out three figures. Should he stay silent?\n\nA bullet answered that question, shredding bark from the tree to his right. Edwin responded with a deep breath, and five plucks of the trigger. He was sure he had taken out one of them, but the fault in this action quickly became evident. One shot became 20, as countless figures approached.Bullets soared through the air like small meteors, demolishing the fauna upon impact. He knew then, the end had come. His face pressed into the dirt, and a scream erupted from his lips. He prayed to any god that might listen, to let this nightmare end.\n\nHis prayers were soon answered. The sharp chop of helicopter blades became deafening, punctuated by a rapturous boom and a surge of heat. Silence reigned then, the only exception the crackling fires.After a time, the shock wore off. Edwin rose slowly, first upon his knees, then two feet. The partisans were gone, as was much of the landscape.\n\nEdwin made his way back towards the road, spotting the target of such destruction. The old concrete bridge, not more than a few meters back. The partisans had been collateral. It was only later, when he had been checked into a med tent, would Edwin learn. Similar incidents had erupted across the front. For many, a horror, but those bombs had saved his life that day. It was an event for which he was eternally grateful."

The man went over his map another time, detailing the game's habitat and expected locations. From the ream of papers and hand notes he moved to another table where his equipment for the day rested. Lovingly, the Reichskommissar verified every nook and cranny of each weapon's mechanics. The ammunition he had hand loaded the previous night, carefully calibrating the amount of powder for his rifle and hunting shotgun. From the tools of the hunt, he carried on to the hunt's accoutrement. Water bags, boots, belt, knife, whistles, field rations.\n\nAs his preparation progressed Müller's nose and ears remembered previous hunts. The smells of the vast african outdoors, the sounds of beasts communicating with one another, the sight of tracks in the dirt and of trees scratched by animals. Each hunt was a kaleidoscope of memories and feelings, and he regretted a bit that his memory could not hold it all. Even his hunting diaries only carried a faint echo of the glory of past expeditions.\n\nVisiting his diary was the last part of his preparation, and the one he cared the least for. Of course, he treasured the words on paper he found, for they were yet another anchor to previous hunts. But the world of paper left him cold, bored. Everyday his bureaucrats begged of him to read just one more document, to sign just one more declaration. Müller pitied the men in their neat suits with tidy glasses. Theirs was a dry world of words and numbers. What really mattered was the thrill, the raw emotions, the fleeting moment where a man could shed off civilization and find the savage joy of the hunt. Müller pitied his bureaucrats, but he was thankful for their dedication. How else would he find so much time to keep hunting?"

 COG_hunt.100.desc:0 "Reichskommissar Müller had begun to wrap his head around how large Africa was, but he still couldn't figure out where the endless paperwork his underlings laboured under came from. This was of little concern to the man. Tons of resources came out for the fatherland, while tons of cash came in from every corner of the world. As long as things went swimmingly, the Reichskommissar felt that it would be a crime not to enjoy his status as much as he could.\n\nStill, the naturally gregarious Müller felt a bit isolated in his position. His only company were an endless rotating cast of bureaucrats and foreign businessmen that desired nothing more than to get their job done and then leave Africa. Of course, he had met some fun people in Südwestafrika. But even the fun people couldn't free themselves all the time for the Reichskommissar's hunting expeditions. Müller was thus perpetually on the look-out for new friends and company as he went on his hunting expeditions. This was at the heart of his new project to look abroad for new hunting partners.\n\nReichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck of Südwestafrika was a strangely serious and melancholy man. But he too seemed to share in Müller's disdain for the drudgery of bureaucracy. The flying ace could often be found in the skies above Africa, surveying his domain like Jupiter atop Mount Olympus. Reichskommissar Müller reckoned that the flying ace might be interested in tagging along on a hunting excursion. Besides, wasn't personal diplomacy between Reichskommissar crucial to their African mission? Müller was sure he could write this off as business expense somewhere."

The help of a flying ace such as yourself would make it easier to navigate the vast expanse of the Congolese interior. It is my humble belief that such an expedition would be a great opportunity to further develop the ties between our two joint missions to further the glory of the aryan race in these mysterious lands. [...] '\n\nThe rest of the letter contained an in depth plan of the expedition, with information on the type of game found in the region, Müller's analysis of weapons suitable for the hunt and a brief anecdote about a previous hunt in the area. Reichskommissar Schenck recognized Müller's rambling stream-of-consciousness style of conversation. An impressive achievement as it was in this literary form, the Reichskommissar was more concerned with the invitation itself than how it would unfold. A trip with Müller might be a nice break from his duties in Südwestafrika.

Various military commanders had complained early in the colony's history that it made strategic planning sessions with the Reichskommissar useless, but thankfully their insubordination had earned them a quick trip to the parts of the Congo where few returned alive, if at all. Dissent had a way of dying down when exile to the Mosquito Coasts of the Congo was a quick alternative to actual change.\n\nNow Müller pored over his most recent map, trying to decide which would be preferable for his ends. He looked at the terrain, bringing to memory his previous hunts and the conditions he'd braved. Since Schenck was a newcomer to this, the tougher grounds were out of the question, especially the parts of the Congo where tribes hostile to the Reich had armed themselves and closed themselves off to the world. And the areas near the Mosquito Coasts were definitely out of the question, no matter how tempting the idea of shooting a few dissidents was.\n\nMüller found his gaze drawn towards the Itombwe Mountains. Plateau and Low mountains, perfect for aerial surveillance and hunting - and the natives weren't uppity enough to justify killing. It sounded perfect to Müller, and as he barked an order to his aides to print an enlarged map of the Itombwe region, his mind was already off in the excitement of the hunt."

The shine of the past forms an obscure ache in his throat - he swallows gingerly. An aide comes to shake him out of his reverie, gesturing to his briefcase and papers, and the Reichskommissar of Südwestafrika grabs his things and leaves the crowded room in Windhoek he has been quartered in.\n\nHe's running through the itinerary sent maybe 8 hours ago from the base in the Congo Müller is quartered in, hoping against hope it doesn't tally with any of the native resistance groups he's taken note of for... reasons, when the gunship arrives. It's the pride of the local helicopter fleet, gleaming and black-edged like a phantom. And also packed to the gills with weaponry, not all of it necessarily in line with the weapons standards Germania sets down. (Does 1 helicopter really need a mobile bazooka turret suitable for an AA battery?).\n\nHe gets aboard with a hurried word to the pilot, and he's on his way to whatever bizarre adventure the Hunter of the Congo, as some have taken to calling him in private, has in mind for them.

Familiarity breeds friendship, but it also breeds some measure of contempt. Not that either side would ever admit it.\n\nSchenck has prepared a special pistol for the occasion, a gilded one with gold leaf carved by an enterprising native goldsmith, and presents it to Müller, smiling as he does so. Not to be outdone, Müller gives something he has prepared beforehand in return: a fine-quality pelt of Northern Congo Lion skin, rolled up and presented with compliments. A fine exchange, and yet neither leaves quite as happy as they thought they would be. (Müller cannot shoot straight with a pistol at 5 meters. Schenck hates fur pelts. Both gift-givers knew of the others' discomforts with their intended gifts and went ahead anyway. Such is life in Afrika.) The servants are dismissed and the two prepare for the real business of the day.\n\nSchenck is the first to get in, somehow managing to clamber in with style; Müller, by contrast, tumbles into the cabin, laughing as he does so.

When he found her dead at the side of a stream, in his grief he flattened a massive plateau to serve as her resting place, for she had once complained of exhaustion when climbing hills to meet the spirit. The plateau he described now rises before the helicopter, a great flat greenish-brown stretch of land dotted with village smoke and the light of fires. Schenck, looking out the window, fancies he can hear the sounds of villagers gossiping and flirting and playing, snippets of lives compressed to a single glance.\n\nThe mounds of earth, the Mountains, now approach the helicopter. Müller mentioned that he knew a great hunting spot, although he had kept the specific target a mystery (it is another of Schenck's personal flaws that he never bothers to check details with those in confidence with him). As they near the zone slowly, the craft begins to judder: perhaps the helicopter is showing its age. Müller, hiding embarrassment, yells at the pilot, who yells back with the familiarity of old friends.\n\nSchenck has heard the origin story of the Mountains, of course, and he thinks it is superstitious nonsense. However, he cannot help but feel a sense of primal awe at the scale of the mountains as he gazes at them, wondering if the infernal crafter of the wild Congo set his paintbrush to run here. Perhaps he is no different from an ape staring into the barrel of the gun, entranced by something he cannot understand. And perhaps the villagers here should be noted for... future efforts, being inheritors to this wild beauty. He makes a note in his journal and resumes his gaze, as the craft slips into the curves of the mountains with an alien grace."

Gorillas roam this part of the Plateau-Mountain jungle in packs, and their traces are fairly visible from the air. All they have to do is follow the trail and the hunt will be theirs. Then Schenck is shoved to the open rear doors of the copter to keep watch for these gorillas. Soon he spots what he is looking for. A distinctive trail of crushed branches, tangled vines, imprints on the forest floor, headed east.\n\nThe helicopter swings around and flies over the trail, headed east. A pack of small figures come into view, and the copter flies so low over the ground Schenck nearly falls over from the turbulence. Thinking about issuing a formal complaint to Germania about this negligence, he points his rifle, aims and shoots. One figure flies back, and the rest disperse - Schenck and Müller take immense joy in chasing them down and hunting the pack. Some escape, but many corpses are thrown to the jungle to rot. It seems the hunt has been successful so far, and despite his best inclinations Schenck is excited about it all."

Perhaps he would have done well as a Heer officer. Müller glances at the map pinned on the helicopter's side, and gestures to a region near the Mountains with a cluster of red pins. Rebel activity, perhaps.\n\nMüller puts down the headset, yelling: "We're getting reports of partisan activity near this area, old chap. Listen, I don't want to hit the brakes on our little endeavor, but it looks like this cluster of hostiles might be close to us - and it's not like we're going to use all these shiny new guns on a bunch of rhinos!" He looks so giddily excited it's hard to imagine he's talking about partisan elimination, not hunting. Schenck closes his eyes and tries to ignore the thoughts going through his mind. Memories of swooping fire, spitting guns, raining hellfire down on little dots that screamed and cried and fell in bloody heaps against the black soil and lay still -\n\nHe shakes himself to consciousness. Müller is still there, still waiting for his affirmation. Schenck can barely bring himself to nod.

Schenck has heard too many stories along these lines from Müller to count, and it seems this one is no different from the others. He focuses his attention on the village below, clustering with people and camp fires: but gunfire crackles ominously to the edge of the treeline. Are these people insurgents, or just native 'protection squads'? It is difficult to tell.\n\nThey drop to a low altitude and start sweeping the village, or encampment: occasionally a gunshot rings out as some poor fool with a stolen weapon fires upwards in an attempt to chase the threat away. Müller yells that they'll have to move in even closer to dispose of the rebels, and Schenck steels himself. He's no longer at the stage where the sound of loud noises leaves him a shivering wreck in the morning. Hopefully it will not return this time.\n\nThe copter heaves up dust and stray leaves as it swings towards the ground, and Müller authorises the use of extraordinary force. He whips out his custom rifle, gives it a pre-emptive check, yells to open the door of the helicopter, leans out and begins shooting. The occasional cry and the grunt of reloading are the only sounds Müller makes as he aims and fires. Schenck feels something drop at the bottom of his stomach. Perhaps it is just his soul. Or perhaps he never had one?\n\nThen the Hunter yells to him: "Come, don't just stand there! Join me and clean this place up!" And Schenck is dragged to his feet before he can utter a single word of protest. Gun in hand, he follows through the motions. Aim. Shoot. Aim. Shoot.

It appears the shell-shock is back again.\n\nSpiraling blades, spinning winds. The world turns on a dance of endless blood and fire, and as Müller shoots, the things he is shooting morph into little boys and girls in Russian villages. As he swoops in on wings of cold metal and hot lead, the figures burst pop-pop-pop like little fleshy firecrackers and fall apart, little broken porcelain dolls like Mutti used to give at Christmas. How raspberryish. How long has it been since he has tasted raspberries? But not like that, surely. Is there blood on his hands or is it just the wrath of his country on his back? Is there a difference?\n\nHe barely hears the panicked shouts: "What are you doing, Schenck? I like the trees too but the insurgents have all gone! Don't make me fill up another ammo request form, damn you!" Violently the world comes back into focus, and Reichskommissar Schenck sticks his head out of the helicopter and retches.

Müller wonders if he's suffering from the same type of glazed-eyes shock that old Heinrich uses morphine to cope with: he was never the same after the incident with the elephant and the patrol squad... either way, Müller can tell when a man is beaten, and Schenck is sure as hell beaten. Perhaps the hunt should be called off.\n\nHe asks again if Schenck wants to continue with the trip. Below him the ruined village sprawls bloated and thick with fumes. It appears that they hit a few of the fuel tanks on approach, and some of the figures running from the scene are luminescent, haloed with gasoline flame. Schenck gazes at the scene and says nothing: his hands, however, reveal what his gaping mouth cannot.\n\nMüller shakes his head and calls for the chopper to head back to base. Maybe another time, friend. Shame you couldn't be a stronger hunter. A corner of his mind thinks that the problem lies with their medical care: perhaps the partisans have poisoned the medical supply? Certainly the Reich has decreed that only bed rest is necessary for recovery from shell shock, and why would Germania give false instructions to its jungle garrisons?"
 COG_hunt.113.a:0 "At least it's over."

 COG_hunt.114.t:0 "The Reichskommissar is back!"
 COG_hunt.114.desc:0 "Reichskommissar Schenck staggers out of the helicopter as Windhoek spirals in his eyes. He can barely make out the aides coming to assist him, and he's far too far gone to care. The shell-shock has eaten away at him over the years, made him weaker even as he strove to avoid it, but at least his aides know what to do. A steady drip of morphine and a few hours of bed rest and he'll be up. At least, until the next time.\n\nAs he lies there in the ward, he looks back on his experience. Did Müller always know about his condition and try to trigger it deliberately? He doesn't think so, but it's always been hard to tell with Müller. In his mind people fall down endlessly, like pins hit by an errant ball, at the touch of the bullets, whistling as they travel down the length of the long and undulating gun. Perhaps that Freud fellow had the right idea about the unconscious: Schenck isn't sure where these dreams are coming from, but he wants them repressed and sent back to the dark corners of the mind.\n\nEither way, one thing is certain: Schenck is never going hunting with Müller ever again. The Hunter can find another companion for his next hunt. As for him? He has work to do, and villages to, ah, do business with."
 COG_hunt.114.a:0 "Well, at least he's safe now."

 COG_hunt.115.t:0 "Why did He Refuse?"
 COG_hunt.115.desc:0 "Müller muses over the terse refusal, in an expression most unusual for the Reichskommissar: brooding depression. It's not quite as wide as a church door, nor as deep as a coffin nail; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Why would Schenck refuse him? Didn't he have the best of fun on the 1958 hunt? (It's a shame about what happened to the natives, but Müller is not one to dwell on tragedies. At least they paid the families off.) Sure, the two have had their differences, and by Gott Schenck can be such a turn-off when he gets all pissy about the 'rights of the natives' and 'proper diplomatic protocol', but they've been firm friends, right?\n\n...Right?\n\nTragedy is best summarized as this: the intrusion of reality into the dreams of men. And as Müller sits there, a whole network of imagined alliances comes crashing around his broad-shouldered bulk. A friendship, a world: all these begin to come undone. If Schenck doesn't even like Müller enough to go hunting with him after all these years. how much can he be trusted? And what about, God forbid, Hüttig?\n\nIt's a tragedy, pure and simple: and the Hunter of the Congo is in the spotlight. He runs through the list of corporations in the Kommissariat with a new skepticism and some degree of desperation. He must ascertain all his people are truly loyal to him, and not puppets of the other Reichskommissariats aiming to poison his success, or perhaps foreign spies. And the planned diplomatic Mega-Hunts next year will be curtailed, indefinitely: Müller has no time for men who have no time for him.\n\nThis is the Hunter of the Congo in new lights: not as hunter, but as prey."
 COG_hunt.115.a:0 "Will Müller ever understand?"

 COG_hunt.116.t:0 "A Very Strange Hunt Indeed"
 COG_hunt.116.desc:0 "Müller, like most seasoned hunters, is just sociopathic enough to dismiss sights which would shake most lesser men to their boots. And certainly an episode, while regrettable, is nothing Müller has not seen before (poor Heinrich never quite recovered, which is a shame, because the fellow was such a good shot with a Mauser). And so the precise reason for unease is lost on the Reichskommissar as he flies back to Leopoldville, and after he returns: and yet it persists, like a particularly vile particle of food stuck behind a tooth.\n\nHe wonders, again, if the problem is with the medical supply. He orders the existing caches of medicine checked, their staff and personnel profiled and all suspicious personnel to be fired and terminated: and yet something remains amiss. In a fit of suspicion, he orders the refiling of all personnel suffering from similar illnesses and reads them himself (truly commendable for the generally ill-lettered man), tossing them to his medical staff with orders for new remedies.\n\nAnd yet the rotten little unease persists.\n\nHe writes a letter to Schenck, asking if the man is alright. He gets a frigid response and a cool affirmation that Schenck is alright, thank you for asking, and would you kindly please stop sending messages through this channel? Thankfully Müller is just dense enough to interpret it as a friendly message, and drops the matter. If Schenck is well, then so is Müller. Perhaps in time he might even recover enough to go on another partisan hunt."

Either case you cheated and ruined the story.\n\nI guess in some weird way you created a world were the trip happened so fast that Schenck didn't have the time to have another traumatic PTSD episode, which I guess could be considered a nice gesture."

 COG_hunt.118.desc:0 "Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller lay on his back in his comfortably cool office, picking his fingernails with a knife. "So fucking hot", he thought. "But not worse than yesterday". He got up and went to get himself a drink, before heaving himself into a chair on his balcony. "Bloody maintenance". His favorite helicopter was done with for the week, it just wouldn"t start. There was always the smaller one for closer game, as his aides had reminded him. To hell with that! Boring beyond belief. He"d shot everything in range of that old piece of junk. Müller had told them to focus on their jobs of administering the colony, and leave the real work of hunting to him!\n\nJust as he laid his feet on the parapet and took the first refreshing sip of his ice-cold drink, he had an idea. "Damn me for this thought", he got up, "but damn me for not thinking about it earlier." He went to the typewriter. "I am bloody here for this."\n\n"Hans, my arrogant colleague, we are in this together. The Führer wants us to cooperate, but you are the obstacle here, not Wolfgang and I."\n\nDespite his thoughts, he began the letter with the same politeness he often displayed in his formal invitations. But his snide commentary continued, if only for his own enjoyment. "You are a different caliber, Hans. But I have hunted worse. You have a damn big territory: how could you neglect its splendor? Let me incite a bit of passion in you." Müller knew this letter would likely amount to nothing. He had nothing better to do, though. So, why not bother with doing what he was here for? This seemed like the best way to cooperate with his joint Reichskommissars to make Afrika an integral part of the Reich. Strictly business... Hüttig would like that phrasing!\n\nThere would have been no problem getting Wolfgang Schenck, his old friend, to tag alone. Now there was a man who understood how to assert German dominance... in one way or the other. The natives needed time. "His loss if he says no; I am just doing my job here!" Müller roared with laughter as he wrote the letter. "You know, Hans, we should really all be friends here and find our peace. I am doing you a favor, after all, trying to end your self-imposed isolation. All of Germania think you"re useless, you old grump...""

The fury of the name Müller was already walloping inside him.\n\nHe put his reading glasses on. He groped the desk tightly. With every letter he read, his knuckles got increasingly white. The arrogant tone intermingling with the contents gave him the rest. He hit the top of his desk with his fist as hard as he could. The pain was bearable due to his general rage. 'Fuck this arrogant fool.' His secretary stormed the office, "Are you alright, Reichskommissar?" Hüttig took off his glasses.\n"Read this!", he said easefully.\n\n"Once again", Hüttig began his rant calmly, contradictory to the rage that was seething within, "he displays his insufficiency to do what the Führer bestowed upon us three here. He is an incapable man who is unable to rule his Reichskommissariat." Something cracked. "Schenck is an incompetent coward, disloyal to the party, and gets away with it. That is barely bearable for me!" The spasm of pain of his fingernails digging his palm. "But Müller openly displays his ineptitude! I hold evidence for it, just look at the letter! Nonetheless he is praised for his decent enforcement of German rule in Afrika by Germania!" 'Meanwhile they forget the only one doing his bloody job'\n\n"Sir?", his secretary said reticently, "Your glasses." Hüttig looked at his palm where a cracked spectacle frame lay next to splintered glasses. 'One day he'll bloody pay for it all. Him and Schenck'. He threw the broken glasses away. "Bring me a typewriter", Hüttig was calmer on the outside than usual, "nobody will heed this letter any mind. But at least I can illustrate Müller's immeasurable incompetency to him, word by word!" 'I know he will not care. But one day I'll drag you before the Reichstag to Hitler. If he proves unreasonably forgiving, I'll stomp you in the mud!'"

Müller, in a jovial mood despite the letter's contents, threw knives at it from behind his desk. 'What am I to do with you, Hans?', Müller laughed. A hit, directly splitting the letter "ineptitude" in two. 'Well, Hans. You can call me everything you want, while I pick the fruits of labor. So much for your rant of my incapability.'\n\nAnother hit, directly splitting a whole sentence. Now it reads, "...while you are working..." instead of "...while you are hunting, I am working...". 'I give you that, I like hunting. But which man of common intellect wouldn't use this opportunity as I have. Alas for you, my work is praised nonetheless. Not yours! I was about to integrate you. I wanted to make friends. But I came to the conclusion you earned your shame, Hans. You can't even handle uprisings.'\n\nAnd another hit, tearing the letter in two. 'For a man with your ruthlessness, Hans, I thought you might want to be graced by glory as well.' Müller picked up the letter, examining it closely. 'What is it shunning you? My African Askari? Maybe. The Hunts? Everybody likes hunts. Schenck? No, he's a nice person, too nice. Me? Well, my temper can be ambivalent, my mother used to tell me. My special game? Hah, that definitely doesn't shun you ruthless bastard.'\n"Fuck you, Hans! You are a mystery", Müller exclaimed lightheartedly.\n\n'Is there currently no one special I haven't hunted with before?' He went to the balcony, gazing at the track vanishing in the wilderness. Red sand dreamfully moved by a breeze. 'Madagaskar. Bloody Maurice! Of course! He has some special creatures over there. I can invite him seeing mine. SS-Hüttig can't stand him, so double-fuck him' He went to the typewriter, realization suddenly flooding him. 'He's much too far away. Besides, I heard these troublesome reports of his populace and reportedly even his garrison.' He gave it up. He took a cold drink and went back to the balcony."

The noise of it rippling the nearby stream hampered his ability to make out the sound of the animal. But he was certain he had found it. A mighty gorilla, an impressive monster. He quickly marked it on the map as ordered and scuttled away.\n\nThe mercenary didn't like to be here, didn't want to be here, he was paid to be here. He knew he and his fellows were the best for the job because they were paid to make sense of the jungle. He didn't question when Siegfried Müller had sent them here, since he paid considerably well and promised bonuses for success. Their task was simple; he wanted them to find the most impressive animals in Africa's jungles to potentially hunt them. This would be something even Robert might enjoy.\n\nSquadrons of helicopters took off from the Reichskommissar's palace to disseminate above the jungle. Tiny helicopters; so tiny that three men barely fit into it barring the pilot. Each was stacked with two or three mercenaries from the hand-chosen commandos, experienced in the unforgiving terrain of the jungle. They were paid to mark Africa's best spots to hunt the jungle wildlife.\n\nTheir helicopter had landed on a plateau a night ago. Each mercenary went off for themself to find the biggest and most brutish beasts to mark the spots that promised the most money in bonuses. Every one of his company having arrived on the plateau they flew off to the Reichskommissar for the report again. Back there nobody asked about each other's successes, not even in their own units."

They carefully stowed their equipment and silently skulked out of the breast-high bushes.\n\nAh, the savannah. Ernst liked it here. Though sweating as if he was running not walking, he enjoyed the sound of the sand squashed beneath his boots. He was fascinated by the wildlife here, by the sparse vegetation, by the games the heat was playing here. He liked it, although he didn't exactly know why. But he understood why the Reichskommissar had sent them here.\n\nThey took off with nearly two dozen helicopters from Léopoldville in the same direction, but soon sprayed into differing regions. All of them gargantuan helicopters packed with veteran garrison troops of the scouting corps to search for the best hunting spots in the region with the best game. It was diverse here, from gentle giants to majestic beasts.\n\nThey arrived at the position they had agreed upon on time. While the helicopters had flown off to scout for impressive animals from the sky, several smaller squadrons of three men were to track down the animals on the basis of their paths on the ground respectively.\n\nThe other two squadrons seemed lucky as well, and when they arrived at Léopoldville early the next morning all but one of the helicopter crews had numerous markings on their maps."

A monstrous gorilla head would make his trophy room just much more impressive.\n\nIn his office he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made were centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal. He had to choose.\n\nOn the one hand, there were the Itombwe Mountains. It would be a straight flight there. Those mountains were not too far from the nominal border to Reichskommissariat Ostafrika and made for the breeding ground of some of the most famed highland as well as green savannah hunting spots in the dales, it was said.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the Virunga Mountains. Located slightly to the north a flight that would lead along the coast of the Congo Lake for some time.

Three garrison troopers, a local path tracker of the Waffen-SS and a mercenary familiar with the location they were going to accompanied him for the hunt.\n\nEverything was ready!

Ahead was a range of highlands thickly covered by vegetation. The jungle canopy forbade any direct view on the ground, especially with the motion blur. Up and down the landscape went. Minor dales marred the mountainous view from becoming a somewhat equally high and endless plateau. Müller enjoyed following the rising and sinking lines of the canopy. Far beyond the most immense ranges of the highland, he spotted the thicket of the jungle ending disturbingly abrupt, giving way to grassy mounds again. But they weren't here for that!\n\nOne of his companions joined him on the skids, shouting despite the noise. "How do you want to proceed? You seem to have gathered the essential details about the spot by now. The gorillas are surely somewhere amidst the thickest covert." A fine question, to be sure.

Eight impressive volcanoes surrounded by the light morning mist, immediately triggering mythical fantasies in Müller's mind. One was higher than the other. Besides, they stretched for miles in either direction. Rocky formations of earth suggested they were intended as steep pathways to reach the mountains. But Müller knew that's how volcanoes were supposed to look. The volcanoes' ascents were overgrown with jungle trees. Though sparser than in other jungle ranges, all eight volcanoes appeared in a mighty green.

Whether it had been alive before or whether it was a neural excess load, the black brute was surely dead now.\n\nThey approached the dead animal on the ground. Step after step Müller's grin widened. Barely a meter apart from it he shook one of his hunting companions by the shoulder and shrieked how he had missed this feeling of overexcitement. He had never slain such a brutish adult gorilla before, and this particularly brutish specimen's head was about to adorn the halls of his palace and bestow upon it the menacing yet tranquil impression this gorilla had radiated.\n\nMüller quickly took hold of his senses again.

Two veterans of the garrisons' scouting corps, a regular Oberst, a local of the province who happened to be part of Müller's native Waffen-SS, and a path tracker he had worked with before. They made themselves comfortable in the grand helicopter's cabin. His companions already started sharing stories of their own hunting experiences. Well, at least those of the garrison, for they had hunted before.\n\nEverything was ready! The Reichskommissar rubbed his hands at the thought of slaying a great buffalo soon. He pictured it right in front of him; aiming at the cow-like creature and directly hitting it through its heart.

Ahead was Bas-Uele. On one side lay hills covered in grassland, with clusters of trees filling in the valleys, snaking along creeks and rivers yet unknown. On the other side was miles upon miles of uninterrupted jungle, thick and lush, concealing the ground from view from the air. Almost anything could be found in these regions, and that's what made them so attractive for today's hunt.\n\nOne of his companions joined him on the skids, shouting despite the noise. "How do you want to proceed? You seem to have gathered the essential details about the spot by now. The Buffalo should be in those riverbanks." A fine question, to be sure.

On the western bank of the Congo Lake, it held thousands of miles of pristine rainforest, untouched by human habitation. The forests had a rich biodiversity of 300 bird species, plus 1,000 plant and tree species which included endangered mahoganies. But the forests were not of much concern to Müller, since there weren't buffalo there.

The adrenaline set in and rushed through his veins at the speed of light.\n\nStanding in the shallow waters of a small pond whose spring seemed to have gone dry recently. The big hefty body of the mighty buffalo appeared in the crosshairs. Sluggish movement of the brown pelage sprinkled with water made Müller smile. He hovered over the bullish animal with his reticle for some time. Finally, its horns, shaped into impressively huge curls, appeared right in the middle. He had his desired target. The other smaller bystanding buffalos were quickly erased from his mind. Should his companions concern themselves with them. He would go for this one!\n\nOne last adjustment. He was ready.

The buffalo fought and wriggled uncontrollably, making the impression it was ruptured by a wild predator. Just in the vicinity of Müller's ear another shot was fired. Swiftly pursued by another one. He himself shot again as well, delivering the ultimate blow. The bystanding buffalos were gone by then, one limping in the distance from one of his companions' shots.\n\nThey approached the dead animal on the ground. Step after step Müller's grin widened. Barely a meter apart from it he cluelessly shot in the air as a harbinger of his overexcitement. He hadn't slain a big buffalo for a long time, and this particularly rare specimen's gargantuan horns were about to adorn the halls of his palace and bestow upon it the beautiful and impressive appearance his grand collection still lacked.\n\nMüller quickly took hold of his senses again.

The buffalo's head promised to be any visitor's favorite already from a far distance. Müller liked it.\n\nHe looked at the positioning of the head and took another sip of his drink. The Reichskommissar crossed his arms and proudly contemplated his work. He had slain this beast! What a story to tell.

When the water calmed down there was nothing but traces made unreadable by their futile shots.\n\nThey searched for them some while on the ground, yet hadn't any luck with it either. Müller just didn't want to return empty-handed. In his anger, he sent shots in the water for nothing but releasing the stress. He had never been so close to slaying a great buffalo with such impressive cornets.\n\nForced to make his peace with not slaying the escaped animal on this unlucky day he took hold of his senses again.

He didn't return early to the adjacent palace today because he was still wondering from earlier on how to expand his trophy collection one floor down. He finally knew now: A kudu. Savannah animals famed for their exalted appearance thanks to their impressive cornets. Sometimes man-tall colossi of horns shaped into slight springs. For their whole outward appearance, Müller used to call them Africa's deer with uncomplex and more impressive cornets.\n\nIn his office he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made were centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal. He had to choose.\n\nOn the one hand there was the border territory of the Lower Chad savannah, crossing directly into the region frequently bombed from Windhoek. But so close to his own territory no bombardments were conducted. Well, he could also ask for the bombings to be stopped in the Chad region. Yet the savannah there made for the animal's preferred terrain and thus for a great hunting spot.\n\nOn the other hand, the Cunene province. Located deep into Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika's center; a flight that could be equally long and satisfying. His fellow Reichskommissar surely wouldn't mind him hunting there. Besides, someone had to keep his friend's wildlife in check.\n\nHe now had to choose where he would find the most impressive game and where he would have the most luck with the kudus."

Müller was overexcited to have visitors gaze onto the grandeur that his collection now boasted thanks to the lion's head. Noble and stalwart. The grand collection, still in early development, and the head of a noble king of the African wildlife complemented each other flawlessly. The lion's head promised to impress each and any visitor Müller hosted. Besides, it promised to draw attention from anyone who'd hear about Müller slaying a grand lion. And he'd make sure everybody knew of it.\n\nHe looked at the positioning of the head, perfectly placed in the center as the collection's new crown jewel. The Reichskommissar crossed his arms and proudly contemplated his work. He had slain this beast! What a story to tell. No one could flee it now with the awe-inspiring lion's head being the incarnation of a hunting tale worth to tell. The imposing look let the Reichskommissar drift into a hunter's fantasy, already imagining a completed trophy collection."

 COG_hunt.247.desc:0 "The bullet merely scratched the beauty's mane, sending shreds of hair swirling in the air!\n\nConfused the lion looked at his females and sent a ferocious roar in Müller's direction. Müller shot again with what seemed to be a trembling trigger finger. The bullet totally missed any of the pack. Another threatening roar, louder and mightier than before. One of his companions was nervously sweating next to him. What followed was a tense stare-off. None of them thought of shooting again, intimidated by the lion's demonstration of might. Then, after some seconds, the pack just left.\n\nMüller searched for them on the ground for some time, his companions refusing to trace down the tracks. Müller just didn't want to return empty-handed. But this time there wasn't any rage of his misfortune; he was still a little nervous. He had never been so close to slaying such a mighty and noble lion as this one.\n\nHe just returned to his companions, not needing to explain his rapidly flattened ambition. While they returned to the helicopter to fly off again, he was certain he had finally met his feral equal."

Not with the intention to hunt the lion; he realized such a mighty of the mightiest deserved to live. He saw himself in the animal. Therefore, he decided that one peaceful day he would return and thank that lion for lending him strength through thoughts back to their unusual clash.\n\nBut he'd only spare this one. One day he'll inevitably need a lion's head in his collection. Yet Müller knew not this one's. He felt awkward to think so and laughed at this seemingly silly notion, but deep down he knew he was doing the right thing."

Looking at the central part of it he saw what he accomplished over the last weeks and months. Not as much as in the years prior but he was certain he could shame his past self by completely indulging into hunting for the next weeks as well. One animal prominently missed in the whole of his collection. He had shot yet only slain one of their kind; they were too robust. But he was confident this time. He'd hunt an elephant!\n\nIn his office he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made were centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal. He had to choose.\n\nOn the one hand, there was the north-eastern bank of the Congo Lake which hosted a great range of savannah animals. It was one of the greener places of the usually believed to be dusty savannahs. The grassy savannah near the lake, recently trimmed from thick canopies could make for an excellent hunting spot. Maybe with a comfortable layover in Hitlerstadt.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the Bas-Uele again. A vast savannah that was a patchwork of grass and steppe. Far to the north-east of the Congo Lake, the long flight might pay off with a broad plentifulness of the animal. The savannah there made for its perfect breeding ground.\n\nHe now had to choose where he would find the most impressive game and where he would have the most luck with the enormous elephants."

Used decades ago, and being just as effective back then. It consisted of older weaponry, something that Müller's grandfather might have fought with. Yet it was reliable as it not only included knives but also devices used in ancient times to read an animal's tracks.\n\nBut he could also choose from modern hunting weaponry. It relied on a range of the newest support devices to make for the perfect kill. It was impressive, heavy and efficient.\n\nHowever, the modern equipment greatly differed from the older, as it lacked its allrounder abilities. Yet the old equipment often failed to make a hunt swift and effective, with robust animals often escaping before the deadly shot.\n\nMüller now wondered what he could slay such a mighty, and robust animal as an elephant with. Its killing certainly made for a bigger effort than ever.

He contemplated his work thus far and left the hall nodding to himself all the while. At the grand helicopter, he instructed his crew for the hunt one last time. It was his biggest crew so far; for they were hunting one of the biggest African beasts. Numerous of the highest-ranking veterans of the garrison, a contingent of natives of the Waffen-SS on a separate helicopter to provide for extra shooting power, the most legendary mercenaries of the famous group called 'the Predators', and a path tracker native to their hunting destination. Each of them was equipped with extra ammunition to slay at least one elephant. Müller knew from previous occasions that much ammo was needed to fell these monstrosities.\n\nEverything was ready! The Reichskommissar rubbed his hands at the thought of slaying a mighty elephant soon. He pictured it right in front of him; aiming at the gargantuan beast and directly hitting it through its heart. And finally hanging the head of the biggest terrestrial mammal.\n\nHowever, he had to hold himself back despite his glee of finally hunting again. For the hunt merely beckoned."

Up ahead was a line of sand, separating the blue waters from dense, uninterrupted jungle.\n\nThe helicopter soared. Ahead was the North-Easter Bank of the Congo Lake. The lake and sand bank was an unnatural formation, created by the Congo Dam miles down south. Most of what lay beyond was jungle, although there was a decent expanse of less dense woodland more toward Cameroon. It was prime tourist land, thus the resort in nearby Hitlerstadt. Many came here for the good weather, the tropical views, and the wildlife of the jungle. Müller had to admit the latter was an extremely attractive draw to many people, himself included.\n\nOne of his companions joined him on the skids, shouting despite the noise. "How do you want to proceed? You seem to have gathered the essential details about the spot by now. The Elephants are obviously in the jungle." A fine question, to be sure. Should they fly lower for a closer look? Or would that give away the element of surprise?\n\nThe hunt might just be decided in this instance."

Ahead was Bas-Uele. On one side lay hills covered in grassland, with clusters of trees filling in the valleys, snaking along creeks and rivers yet unknown. On the other side was miles upon miles of uninterrupted jungle, thick and lush, concealing the ground from view from the air.

It felt like the dawn of a tiny battle. Well, Müller brought a small army of hunters to be sure. The path tracker finally spotted the location of a group of elephants! Müller barked the final orders. Now the hunt was on.\n\nIt looked like a family of elephants. A few kids, one half-grown teen, a female, and an old male; at least Müller pictured it like that in his head. He made some gestures, providing the necessary orders to his crew. He and the veterans would go for the mightiest of the traveling group. The natives were supposed to circle the smaller ones and shoot as much of them as possible to satisfy the mercenaries that insisted to be paid in ivory. Therefore, 'the Predators' concerned themselves with hunting another group of elephants farther to the north. There were more of them, but all of them smaller. Yet Müller wanted the mightiest elephant head! Thus, he decided on this particular one.\n\nOne last gesture. They were ready. He started counting on his hand for his companions to see.\n\nThree!\n\nTwo...\n\nOne!"

Shot after shot it rose and sank down again, struggling with an unyielding will to survive. Everyone had reloaded by this point. Müller even thought about going for the head, yet he didn't want to besmirch his trophy. It finally fell for the last time in a long-drawn act of what could have been a staged death in a Shakespearean drama. Not that he ever read or saw one, but he imagined them like that. Finally, the dust settled.\n\nThey made the tallies on the ground. The female was about to flee out of their eyesight when 'the predators' appeared and slew the beast in a few shots. After adding her bloodied ivory to their reservoir, they greeted Müller with a bunch of smaller and bigger partially red-colored tusks backpacked. He had slain only one of these mighty creatures. Yet he had slain the biggest and wouldn't give the slightest cell of it away. Though they arrogantly asked for his acquired tusks, he sent them toward the killed younglings.\n\nMüller quickly took hold of one of the tusks and made certain they were his, engraving a small 'Siegfried' on one of them.

The grand collection, finally developing and shaping up to become something, and the head of the mightiest of the African wildlife complemented each other flawlessly. The elephant's head promised to let any visitor feel small and lost compared to its monstrous size.\n\nHe looked at the head before its positioning, made some small adjustments to the trophy, and began instructing the concierges. The Reichskommissar crossed his arms and proudly contemplated his work. He had slain this beast! What a story to tell. No one could flee it now with the magnificent elephant's head hanging there to force even the shyest visitor to ask for the hunting story.

Mostly of Müller's origin, the bullets seemingly didn't bother the animal at all, though. Staggeringly, it struggled its way out of the crossfire and was lost soon thereafter. Looking to the left he could see the natives having more luck with the younglings, only one of them escaping the bullets. Suddenly Müller remembered the female! But before being able to shoot again, one of the 'predators' waved from her dead back at Müller.\n\nHe sent some of his men searching for the male on the ground. Müller just didn't want to return empty-handed, because he refused to integrate underdeveloped youngling heads into his grand collection. Either way, their grandeur was gutted by 'the predators', claiming their ivory prize. They even refused to hand over the female's head whole, although they had enough tusks from the group they successfully hunted, enraging Müller for just a minute.\n\nHe returned to his companions, glooming about this unlucky hunt. While they returned to the helicopter to fly off again, he swore to employ 'the predators' for the most boring operations he could think of. Or maybe the Mosquito Banks?"

He wanted to know which place he'd shun when intending to hunt an elephant for his grand collection in the future, after all.\n\nHe gritted his teeth on the whole way back, worrying his companions that were used to a jovial Müller. One day, he'll hunt a mighty elephant. But for now, Müller just wanted to get rid of 'the predators' in his vicinity, potentially thwarting his plans again. Therefore, he released some stress by shooting any game he saw on the way back. By the time they arrived at their home destination, the ammunition of his equipment, as well as that of his ten veteran companions on the helicopter, was about to run dry.

A savannah that Müller found to be eerily dusty and lame on one of his visits there. But topis liked it there and compromises had to be made for the perfect game.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the northern parts of his own fiefdom. The part where light jungle canopies gave way to grassy landscapes finally disintegrating to reveal the savannah. Nothing special considering the vegetation there.

No one could flee it now with the big creature's head begging to have this story told. The fine look reminded him of how many of Africa's finest creatures he's already encountered - and how many the palace's visitors will soon encounter."

The successive shots were a total disaster, sending sprays of mud between the unintentionally dodging hogs. Maybe the unluckiest way bullets were ever handled in Müller's eyes. The creatures made their escape nearly unharmed, barring one dead hoglet.\n\nThey searched for the adult hogs some while on the ground, yet hadn't any luck with them either. Müller just didn't want to return empty-handed. He wouldn't even consider taking the tiny hoglet as a trophy, for it looked nothing special like the grown red river hogs. Had he just claimed a river hog head trophy before... Well, he could still use the stuffed one at the palace. But Müller wasn't a man of cheating himself like this.\n\nForced to make his peace with not slaying the escaped animal on this unlucky day he took hold of his senses again. While they returned to the helicopter to fly off again, he swore to take head trophies from all hunted game from now onwards."

 COG_hunt.2110.desc:0 "Josef Mengele, Hauptabteilungsleiter für Afrikanische Politik of Reichskommissariat Ostafrika - essentially acting as a foreign minister, just took his leave from Siegfried Müller on the helipad after an important meeting. They shook each other's hand with throttled rancor palpable in the doctor's eyes. It was merely a boring meeting about some already doomed treaty but this snob played himself like an exalted representative. Thus, Müller examined the brought gift after the obnoxious man's vehicle was nowhere to be seen anymore. And its quickly recognizable color pattern gave him a much more exciting thought immediately: a hunt.\n\nIn his remote office at Hitlerstadt he pondered over the map where every mark his scouts had made was centralized for posterity. He swiftly identified the two spots he preferred for their plentifulness of the animal he wanted to hunt. He had to choose where he'd have the most luck with a giraffe. Unfortunately, the most impressive examples were predominantly found in Hüttig's Ostafrika.\n\nOn the one hand there was the Serengeti. A flight that would take him beyond yet another lake and deep in Ostafrika's north. That Idyllic savannah with its prominent grass landscapes would certainly find him an impressive savannah.\n\nOn the other hand, his choice fell on the Akagera. Located before the aforementioned lake yet similarly within Hüttig's Reichskommissariat. Not too dissimilar from the Serengeti, the giraffe was to be found here in plenty as well..\n\nHe now had to choose where he'd hunt the giraffes. However, he had to keep in mind where he was going. Hans Hüttig was anything but friendly towards Müller and it wasn't unlikely this hunt would see him stirring up the most dangerous predator on the African continent."

Though boring to the onlooker's eye, Müller found some joy in it.\n\nThere was always the option to choose from the classical hunting equipment. Used decades ago and being just as effective back then. It consisted of older weaponry, something that Müller's grandfather might have fought with. Yet it was reliable as it not only included knives but also devices used in ancient times to read an animal's tracks.\n\nBut he could also choose from modern hunting weaponry. It relied on a range of the newest support devices to make for the perfect kill. It was impressive, heavy and efficient.\n\nHowever, the modern equipment greatly differed from the older, as it lacked its allrounder abilities. Yet the old equipment often failed to make a hunt swift and effective, with robust animals often escaping before the deadly shot.\n\nMüller now wondered what he could slay such a big majestic creature like a giraffe with. On the other hand, he also had to keep in mind that he was very much preparing to leave his comfort zone."

Furthermore, he planned a helicopter route that would lead through the territory Hüttig had the least control of - hah, there were a lot to choose from in that regard. He just hoped that the damn partisans wouldn't meddle with his hunt.\n\nMüller went around the Hitlerstadt garrison to gather a crew of the most experienced scouting corps members and excellent marksmen, completing his crew by including his personal guards. This time there were neither natives nor mercenaries allowed; he needed absolute, unyielding trust in his crew.\n\nEverything was ready! The Reichskommissar rubbed his hands at the thought of slaying a majestic giraffe soon. He pictured it right in front of him; aiming at the speckled fur of this tall creature with its filigree head on an enormous neck. Him approaching after the deadly blow and fascinated by the exalted aura it would soon radiate in his grand collection.\n\nHowever, this hunt had to account for multiple factors. Certainly, the adrenaline rush thus wouldn't solely be incited by what he was hunting - rather where!"

Though if they hadn't been joined by intercepting aircraft by now, they probably never would be.\n\nThe helicopter soared. Ahead was the legendary savannah of the Serengeti. Thousands of acres of hills, woodlands, hills, and the famously picturesque grasslands. It's geographic diversity was far surpassed by its zoological wealth. The most famous African animals could be found here. Wildebeests, gazelles, zebras, buffaloes, and, most importantly, giraffes.\n\nOne of his companions joined him on the skids, shouting despite the noise. "How do you want to proceed? You seem to have gathered the essential details about the spot by now. The Giraffes shouldn't be hard to see, even from a great height." A fine question, to be sure.

The helicopter darted between and above the mountains of Rwanda, over the trees and small farms that dotted the landscape.

Ahead was Akagera, an expansive mixture of montane, swamp, and savannah in Eastern Rwanda. Named after the Kagera river, which flowed along its eastern boundary into a system of lakes and papyrus swamps. With a massive diversity of wildlife, it made perfect sense for the Belgians to once declare it a wildlife sanctuary. Maybe it still was. Müller hadn't checked.

Already rushed with adrenaline he made sure the pilots were keeping tight and the sentinels on the skids weren't missing any Ostafrikan outposts. However, they found something else. They found the true purpose of the hunt!\n\nA group of tall and majestic giraffes grazing between a set of savannah trees, their shading crowns delivering the perfect image of what Africa was all about. Müller was silent for a minute, reminiscent of all his hunts prior. There was almost a tiny spark of regret that he had brutally destroyed such beautiful sceneries before. But no! He reminded himself that his hunting trophies were perpetual captions of these sceneries.\n\nHe firmly took hold of his rifle and silently barked orders to put his decided on method of approach strategy into action. The big bodies gracefully moved to take their nibbles on the grass. Movements that made Müller grin before he started aiming in his opted position. He hovered over the majestic animal with his reticle for some time. Finally, he chose which one he'd go for. He had his desired target. The bystanding giraffes were nothing to him.\n\nNow he forgot everything around him - the environment around him dissolved into pure concentration on this particular animal.

Blood flooded onto the grass, while the other giraffes escaped, desperate to survive. One of the giraffes attempting to flee was horribly penetrated by several bullets, yet succeeded to ultimately heave itself to safety. The other two escaped nearly unharmed. The deed was done; the victory Müller's. He was even surprised himself how smoothly it all went down. Now it was about time to claim the trophy.\n\nThey approached the dead animal on the ground. Step after step Müller's grin widened. He was happy beyond belief. He had only slain one giraffe once, very early in his Reichskommissarship. He had hunted them after a meeting in Salisbury, without permission. While Hüttig actually could never have known about it since the Reichskommissariats were still in the buildup, he made some queer comments about giraffes at their next meeting. He probably knew this time as well; this time it was an intrusion on top.\n\nMüller quickly gave the orders to help him cut out the trophy. He wanted to be out of Ostafrika as swiftly as possible. With the hunt over, he started to be wary again. He just hoped Hüttig's response wouldn't be... unreasonable and rash."

He felt watched, followed after. But what should have happened? Hüttig himself would never arrange the 'accidental' shooting of a Zentralafrikaner helicopter that bore the marks of the higher echelons. Yet on the other hand...\n\nHe shook it all away. Instead he focused on finding the perfect positioning for this majestic trophy. Including parts of the giraffe's long neck, it was the largest so far. Thus, the options were limited. Once hooked up, Müller again proudly contemplated the hunts. By now he had come to the realization that the hunting season wouldn't allow for many more impressive trophies. The grand collection would have to wait for a few months, but the occasional casual hunt wouldn't have to. All prior trophies standing witness he swore to continue the grand collection to capture the African wildlife in all plenty as soon as the constellations would align again.\n\nWhile he patted the giraffe's long neck with absent thoughts, a clerk entered the room hastily. "A call for the Reichskommissar. From the Generalbüro für Ostafrikanische...". Müller cut him off with a nervous giggle, very unlike the usually jovial man we came to love.\n\n"Fuck!""

Black boots, black trousers, a black savannah uniform appeared. On top, a head like from some propaganda poster, blonde and blue-eyed, greeted him with an innocent smile. Müller took a deep breath when they beckoned his hunting crew. They met on the ground. His crew of a dozen, and roughly the same number in Ostafrikaner SS with some additional English garrison volunteers standing sentinel.\n\nThey informed them they were on regular patrol duty and needed to search their belongings. Müller tried to clarify who he was, but the Obergruppenführer's response was merely another smile directly into his face. Müller knew he had to let them check him and his crew or this could end very badly. The blonde Obergruppenführer circled them during the inspection and went through some formal documents for the procedure.\n\n"We're glad to be of help to such a famous personality as you, Herr Reichskommissar." He handed back the documents. "This region is dangerous to the higher echelons, but no need to thank us. You surely got distracted by the beautiful giraffes. However, we seem to have sent them in a hurry with our appearance." He looked at his SS unit and smiled at Müller again. "It would be an honor to accompany you back to Zentralafrika.

However, he also knew under different circumstances Hüttig's response could have been completely different.\n\nThe Obergruppenführer insisted that two of his men would have to fly on Müller's helicopter to the border, while theirs guided them. Fucking bastards! How cocky they sat there. Proud of yourselves, eh? One part of Müller was in a total rage. The other, however, was in total anxiety. The Ostafrikaner SS controlled the leverage now. Right now that could just as well be Müller's last hunt.\n\nA few hours later, however, he found himself shaking hands with the blonde smiling fucker that screwed up today's climax.

He'd invite his good friend, Général Jacques Massu, for a gregarious hunt. Just like the old days...\n\nHe'd finally have to pay him back for this cheating of his at the card game from their last meeting of a calmer manner. He'd also had many games with him of fiercer nature for sure. He'd also had a few games of the roughest nature alongside him, but this refers to the game of life and death. Hah, the good old days... clear in Müller's memory as ever. How could he forget those days with the man he'd dubbed "my long lost brother".\n\nSiegfried Müller slumped into his chair from the efforts of the early morning. Now it'd come to the greatest effort of his. Forming nice words for a neat letter to invite his friend. But he shits on the stuff his bureaucrats tried to force down his throat. Müller knows Massu, and Massu knows Müller. He'd forgive him some errors with his French, or some more colloquial brusqueness.

Müller released him from the struggle by laying a firm hand on his shoulder and leading him to a calmer corner.\n\nHe patted the man's shoulder, leaving a dusty mark on the suit he scornfully glanced at through his fogged glasses. Müller made him hold his two rifles and the one substitute, just in case, to exchange them for the paper. He never thought he'd do that, but he glanced a distinctive stamp during their walk.\n\nSiegfried Müller clamped all the unimportant notes between his legs, and read the letter that concerned him the most.

So, he went inside the airport to get into a cleaner military garb for the happy occasion, carefully attaching the Iron Cross to his breezy camouflage coat.\n\nWhen he was entering the tarmac again Rolf Steiner was arriving with a grand guard of honor, encompassing his finest veterans and many that served once before under Massu in the French remnant. They were all garbed so formally and pretentious. Had he chosen the wrong uniform? He laughed that off. Massu wouldn't mind some informalities or two.\n\nThe distant noise of an aircraft heading for Léopoldville airport was coming closer. His anticipation grew with every tone the aircraft's humming augmented. Then finally the squeaking on the tarmac with the wheels hitting the runway. The privately owned aircraft took its circle, and Müller's anticipation grew unbearable.\n\nThe jetway finally docked, the door opened, and the Général stepped into the hot air, heat haze above the tarmac making the onlookers dizzy. Massu was much too pompously garbed in his finest uniform. Fuck this bragging idiot.\n\nMüller approached with long strides and immediately embraced Massu in a tight brotherly hug, cutting the 'bise' ostensibly short. "Brother", they greeted each other in unison, pulling their foreheads together. Having their arms swung around the other's shoulder they walked down to Rolf Steiner, flanked by the guard of highest honor.

Though fluent in every language the other two used, they chattered like twins separated at birth. Changing from naughty French to pieces of English, from English to German, from the few bits of German to an elaborate conversation in French once again. Even if they didn't comprehend the language the other used, they would possibly still understand each other.\n\nWhen Müller, already a bit drunk, and Massu, still sober, hopped off at the government complex, they entered in for a night of garrulous conversations: Massu updated Müller on the current situation in the French remnants, fitting in an anecdote here and there. Müller, very drunk at this point, elaborated on his many hunts since their last meeting and on the hunts before their last meeting, of course. He talked about exquisite creatures, gossiped about the other African Reichskommissars, and recalled the heroism of the two's last stand near a Cameroon entrenchment, both enjoying fighting more than commanding back then, before the helicopter picked them up.\n\nNeither of the two slept for the whole night, drinks and their laughter keeping them awake.

But Müller, of course, ordered a detour to reminisce about the good old times with Massu and possibly bring them back to life a bit longer.\n\nWithout the slightest trace of fatigue after their long nocturnal talk, the two eagerly hopped on the helicopter. Yet again in a torrent of rowdy laughter, Müller made promises of great game he and Massu would hunt this day. Already reminiscent of their last hunt, when they were in hot pursuit of a big mountain gorilla, they talked themselves into a frenzy, while their device of transportation was slowly hovering away under great noise and a whirlwind of red-colored earth, the rotor blades creating a cool breeze.\n\nAs they were lifted higher into the air, their vigorous talk still didn't abate. Mainly Müller was talking, because Massu was carried away by the beauty of Zentralafrika he so long yearned to see once again. The Général was getting a bit drowsy by the constant humming of the machine and the landscape rolling past. Müller, meanwhile, was vigorous as ever - either energized by the alcohol or by the idea of hunting with his dear friend.\n\nAs Massu's eyelids shut close, Müller grinned.

It only got funnier when they reminisced about their first meetings during the wars with Cameroon where a similar challenge was involved - though game of another kind was shot...\n\nThey couldn't even look at each other without laughing or grinning when Massu spotted something in his canthus. Something white grazing on a plain mound. Müller noticed and followed his friend's gaze. They moved to the skids.\n\nMüller nearly shrieked with overexcitement and pulled Massu tight to his body in the same instance. Yet another contest emerged after Müller ordered the pilots to close in. Grinning with overexcitement he handed Massu his rifle.

Gulping the icy cold liquid Müller was still grinning from his second contest triumph of the day. It was very close... if Massu had only plunged the last bullet into the correct body part of the big brutish white rhinoceros.\n\nMüller scuttled away, hastily doffing his clothes, to jump into the pool. The Reichskommissar looked at the Général expectantly. Massu shook his head, mumbled to himself, and took off his clothes. The heat had been implacable, after all. Müller greeted him with a splash of water. Their comfortably cold bath had them reminisce the time their boat ran out of fuel on the Congo Lake.\n\nThey settled into the biggest suite of the complex for the night. They got everything they hoped for, starting off with a lavish dinner. The two were gradually getting drunker by the minute. With the increasing inebriation, their party turned into an actual orgy. They invited guests, both men and women, from other rooms, played one game after the other, challenged each other to ludicrous contests, and had a nocturnal swim in the pool. Soon the whole hotel was awake, but Müller's authority prevented any retaliation. In fact, the games only turned rowdier and naughtier from there on. Müller, who had drunk several men unconscious by this point, got into a quarrel with a husband over his wife. The Reichskommissar nearly cut the fight short by planting a bullet in the man's head before Massu's intervention.\n\nThe party swiftly dispersed after this. Massu eventually went back to the suite as well, torn between laughing and shaking his head about his friend. Only Müller was heard shouting unintelligibly and shooting arbitrarily early into the morning."

 COG_hunt.309.desc:0 "The sun was already high in the sky when Massu and Müller were ready to depart. While Massu, already recuperated from the nocturnal intemperance, enjoyed a nice morning walk and the lavish luxuries the resort offered, Müller had to be carried back to his messy bed in the once appealing suite to sleep the inebriation off. When the helicopter to take them back to Léopoldville arrived, Müller was still somewhat unconscious. This was the opportunity for Massu to take a trip around the island and enjoy the day's relatively merciful sun.\n\nJust when the Général returned, Müller finally woke up, though in considerably worse shape than the day before. He seemed very baffled at first, but when they embarked on the helicopter, their things long loaded onto it, the realization gradually reemerged.\n\nThis flight was jovial at first as Müller still seemed a bit drunk, at least he behaved like it. But with the gradual passing of time, Müller sunk back into his baffled state. However, Massu didn't worry the least. This night's bender left the Reichskommissar better off than after their first common victory in the Cameroon Conflicts.\n\nMassu reminisced about these good old times with an increasingly broader grin, while he also enjoyed the wild landscape. Müller, all the while, turned unusually silent."

Müller had finally slept off his inebriation and they enjoyed one last day driving along the tracks of the Congo Lake. It was one last day of enjoyment, hunting, and drinking - though less than two nights before. Müller challenged three pairs of men from his mercenaries and his garrison to a contest against him and Massu. The first group to bring back a slain crocodile was promised Müller's best liquor. The Reichskommissar and his friend won, of course.\n\nAfterward, their time was already long due. Thus, they found themselves here on the tarmac, Massu's aircraft waiting for him. Rolf Steiner said his farewells to Massu, still with the formal distance. Müller accompanied him to the entry. One last tight brotherly hug. One last time staring deep into each other's eye. One last remark on a hopefully more imminent reunion this time. One last pull on Massu's neck. One last sad grin at Müller.\n\nOne last goodbye...\n\nSiegfried Müller sullenly turned to clear the aircraft's door. Jacques Massu entered the vehicle, something glistening in the corner of his eye. Yet both felt the heartening anticipation of their next reunion."

Soaked through to the bones, he hopped off his vehicle, splashing in a puddle of muddy water splattering the impeccable trousers of a bystanding bureaucrat. Müller absently grabbed for the pile of documents the man in the disturbingly big glasses was holding out for him and cut him off with a wave of his grimy hand before his incomprehensible babble began. In a thick Bavarian accent, the bureaucrat talked about things that Müller was loathsomely obliged to know about yet felt completely apathetic about, nonetheless. Strange how things that seemingly blinded the vision for the actual life were dictating the course of history.\n\nChanging the course of history in a monotone manner, completely disregarding the fact that one's life passed still... faster and faster... until you realize your fate was sealed long ago by the decisions you made. By the things you said, the thoughts you had, the action you took.\n\nSiegfried Müller was speaking right now, evoking a thought, inducing an action. Life was passing, but he wanted to seal his fate himself.\n\nThe message was being prepared for Jacques Massu, Müller's dearest and most trusted friend in what was the course of his life. But what has it still in store? One thing changes and the world is another place. Yes, those were the thoughts that determined life rather than impeccable behavior, precise knowledge of figures and service to some state that is bound to the same rules as men, just of a longer timespan.\n\nMüller was certainly worried about his future and he wanted to speak and think about it with his good friend to take the action that would seal a fate worthy of a man that thought like the Reichskommissar."

The bureaucrat stopped puffingly. He nearly collapsed as he presented the message, staggering noticeably. Müller, with a widening grin of glee for the unnecessary marathon this boring warrior of words and figures had to conduct, was moving towards his latest prey. Stooping to pick it up something the messenger read caught his attention.\n\nThe fate that you sealed...\n\nHe turned from the carcass to demand the origin of the message. Jacques Massu. Yes... yes, he agreed to return. Müller's mood immediately skyrocketed, making him nearly jump and exclaim like a child given this gift that they always wished for and never stopped niggling about.\n\nYes, Massu agreed to return. A pleasantly sooner reunion than between the last occasion and the Lake incident... Regardless, the Reichskommissar's worries and grueling thoughts may finally be laid aside."

 COG_hunt.313.desc:0 "It all resembled the last occasion. An elaborate motorcade, extensive columns of honor guards, and a wary Steiner. It all resembled the last occasion but for a slightly late Reichskommissar himself. Instead of waiting on the beaming hot tarmac an hour before Massu's arrival, Müller kept lying in bed worryingly longer than usual. He cradled his head in his hands for elapsing minute after minute, nervously fiddling at his brows with the tips of his fingers, putting much effort in elaborating the worries about his future, and suppressing thoughts seemingly a lifetime away.\n\nJacques Massu was already halfway down the aisle the honor guard, composed of apt mercenaries and experienced garrison troops, when Müller approached his dear friend with long strides. Thoroughly confused by the rash hug from his considerably shaggy friend, unkempt hair, unbuttoned uniform and all, the jovial Müller regained something that he had seemingly lost in the course of a week: His smile.\n\nYet it vanished abnormally quickly for a friend can still disappoint his brother... his brother in arms in the Heights, on the Plateau, on the Lake... his brother in thought on the area of warfare, of the conduct of life... his brother in terms of ambition, pursuit of their goals and, most importantly, of their unique, often despised, way of handling things.\n\nHis brother until death if he means to be it. Whether theirs or someone else's is still up to debate.\n\n„Willkommen, mon ami! We have much to discuss. And I feel some minor urgency tingling in my guts. "Thus, Müller abruptly pushed Massu down the aisle."

 COG_hunt.314.t:0 "Der Pakt?"
 COG_hunt.314.desc:0 ""You know, Jacques. I've been thinking a lot lately. Stuff's going on everywhere that made me question my decisions." Müller began with an undertone of melancholy as he poured an expensive brandy, produced and sold solely in the US and always gifted to him by one of the generous American investors. He sat down next to his friend and looked at him with an obviously forced smile. "And I have the feeling you may be the only one who truly understands me. None of these pencil-pushers would comprehend my worries as you could."\n\nMassu has never seen his endeared friend so somber. Not once in their so very long friendship has he been so joyless. He either smiled and laughed or smirked to himself about some naughty thing he has thought up. His worries must have been critically imminent. Massu laid his hand on Müller's shoulder. The absent Reichskommissar flinched before realizing whose reassuring hand it was.\n"What is it, mon ami. We can fix it together."\n\nMüller sighed. "This one day, coming back from an abortive meeting, I looked at this young Bavarian bureaucrat in my service. And... Well, I always laughed at them for their obscenely accurate behavior, but... but that day I pitied him. Not only him, all my civil servants. Their life's passing as they gear towards the success of a rusting system, of a rusting world of monotone decision-making." Müller's voice started to crack in desperation."Then I realized that even I am a part of this system. That my life is passing in front of me, while I make meaningless decisions in this dreary monstrosity of governance I thought I would find joy in. If not joy in representing my country, joy in the wildlife or whatever..."\n\n"Jacques, I am lost. I want to make a meaningful decision. I thought that in case this sorry Reichskommissariat refuses to let me enjoy my life, I could hop over to your lodge in the French remains. We'd be together and could enjoy our lives, finally. I'd be rid of this burden. We could be warriors again... of fortune and glory" Müller looked at his brotherly friend in hopeful anticipation. He knew he was asking much."
 COG_hunt.314.a:0 "But was it too much?"

 COG_hunt.315.t:0 "Le Pacte"
 COG_hunt.315.desc:0 "Müller was still looking at the floor, ashamed for how all this lamentation must have looked to Massu. He felt he was on the verge of overstraining their friendship. Yet he couldn't live like that. Though Massu was his brother, he had to worry about his own life still. But was that really a reason or just another meaningless decision he had rendered.\n\nMassu was shaken by how devastated his friend was. His voice, his articulation... there might even have been tears in the corners of his eyes. He was asking much, but he was his friend. No, his brother. And in a serious state, besides. While others wouldn't understand Müller's thinking to abandon the powerful position of Reichskommissar, Massu knew how very endeared an adventurous life was to Siegfried Müller. Even the Général himself would often find himself abandoning his country for his personal gain. One can't leave his brother like that, for he wouldn't be his brother otherwise.\n\n"From now on I'll have the parcel next to mine reserved for you. In case you decide to retire, we can enjoy life together." There it was again, unusually wide and with a spark of surprise: Müller's smile."While I can't disregard the obligations I have, I will always have time for my brother. Then we are not lone warriors anymore, but fight side by side for whatever cause until our song has been sung."\n\nThey sealed their pact with a jovial celebration to the ringing of their glasses filled with brandy. Müller, now in something similar to his old mood, would take some time to consider his position in Zentralafrika. At the dawn of the conclusion he'd from now on have the option to retire in Free French territory and make his life meaningful. He and his brother could finally enjoy themselves from then on without the toils of state rivalry or Müller's harnessing obligations.\n\nNothing could break this pact now, for it was sealed in brotherly concord."
 COG_hunt.315.a:0 "But could really nothing break it?"

 COG_hunt.316.t:0 "Send Out the Invitations"
 COG_hunt.316.desc:0 "His pen tapped furiously against his desk as Siegfried Müller thought of what to do. Across from him stood his trophy wall, adorned with animal heads from all over Africa. They stared down at his plight, silently mocking him. After all, Siegfried was in a position he had never even dreamed of being in- he was getting tired of hunting.\n\nIt seemed impossible that the man who spent a majority of his time hunting could ever get tired of hunting, but it was true. It felt as if it was the same old trip every time: pick a place, fly out, shoot, fly back. The monotony of something he had once loved tore at his heart. He could not give up such an important release of his. He needed some way of breaking the routine that he had entered.\n\nSuddenly, an idea came to him- why not invite some new acquaintances along? Not just any friends, no- people he wanted to grow closer to, both politically and personally. After all, having new friends in powerful places can never be a bad thing.\n\nAs he wrote, three men came to mind. The first, Ladoke Akintola, was the leader of the warlord state of Yorubaland, and a man Müller wished to sell more weapons to. The second, Patrice Lumumba, was a popular local politician in Zentralafrika. His influence with the native populace would be helpful for the colony, and for sales. Finally, Leonard Mulamba, leader of the Zentralafrikan-SS. The man himself seemed interesting enough, and having the leader of the SS on Müller's side could only be a positive.\n\nWith the stroke of a pen, the three letters were finished with flourished, and each was fast tracked to their destination. Müller sat back, imagining the great hunt that would soon come with his new friends. He could already feel that old fire of his burning hot and bright again. It was safe to say he could not wait for the responses."

I, Siegfried Müller, humbly invite you to join me on my next hunt."\n\nLadoke Akintola did a double take when he first skimmed this line of the letter embossed with a glossy stamp of Hitler himself adorning the envelope, reading it again in confusion. An invitation to hunt with the Reichskommissar himself? It was not something Ladoke had come to expect. Besides that, to call Akintola and Müller "Esteemed friends" was a bit of an overstatement, to put it lightly. Akintola himself wasn't sure if he had ever said more than a sentence to Müller. In fact, up until this moment, all the relations between the Reichskommissariat and Yorubaland had been purely business-related. For such a sudden change of heart to occur was very. . . interesting.\n\nAkintola's first instinct was to refuse outright. After all, it couldn't possibly be true that Müller had gone out of his way to invite him to Zentralafrika solely for the purpose of hunting, could it? However, something pulled at the back of his mind, urging him to go along. No part of the letter could really be construed as threatening, and why would Müller wish to interfere with the politics of a nation such as Yorubaland? For a moment, Ladoke pondered his options."

Müller's smile grew wide and large as he tore open the envelope, anxious to see the response.\n\nUnfortunately, it was not the response he was hoping for.\n\nMüller's smile was quickly replaced with a mix between a grimace and a frown as he read the bad news- Akintola would not be joining him on his hunt. Citing a mix of "security reasons" and "a need for strong leadership", Akintola explained his predicament in no uncertain terms, though he certainly said he would if he could. Müller wasn't sure if he believed him or not. Disappointed, he tossed the envelope aside, where it landed in a pile of old colonial reports. It was certainly a shame to miss out on the man- he seemed like an interesting fellow, for sure. However, there were still two others, and Müller now eagerly awaited what he hoped would be a more positive response."

Surprisingly enough, Akintola had enthusiastically accepted Müller's offer. It was something that Müller had certainly not expected, but he wasn't one to complain. At least he had one acquaintance to make friends with.\n\nStill smiling, Müller stood up to grab the bottle of whiskey at the corner of his table. As he poured a glass of the drink, he looked out into the wilderness of the jungle that lay outside of the city limits. Soon he would return to its green embrace, and he would be bringing a friend along."

Inside, the two German pilots waited impatiently as their passenger grandstanded to the cheering crowds. It had been much time since the pilots had risked their lives landing on the cratered mess that, at least theoretically, styled itself as a runway. Since then, they had been sitting in their seats, watching as Akintola shouted to his people. If the pilots had spoken the language of Yorubaland, and perhaps had been a hundred feet closer, they would have understood why he was taking his time.\n\nQuestions were shot at Akintola like a machine gun, as the many citizens around him questioned why their leader would visit with those who bombed them on a regular basis. No matter how many times he spoke of the benefits of close relations with Germany, no matter how many times he spoke honey about how the people of Yorubaland would no longer be troubled with poverty and destruction, it seemed that nobody would listen. On the other hand, perhaps nobody could hear him over the noise of the plane, since the questions kept being repeated by different people in different places in the crowd. After the same question was asked for the 4th time, Akintola evidently had enough, and made his way up the steps into the cabin.\n\nThere, a full kit of camouflage, a Panama hat, a rifle, and multiple boxes of ammo sat waiting for him. As the plane bumped its way into the air, Akintola sighed with relief. Perhaps he really could enjoy himself on this trip."

The runways of Leopoldville, which normally were jam-packed with foreign planes taking loads of cargo out of Zentralafrika, was abnormally quiet as the transport plane coasted to a stop. For a moment, there was silence as the propellers wound down, and Akintola wondered what was going on.\n\nIt did not take him long to find out.\n\nThe staircase outfitted on the bomber opened with a crack, and a military band, dressed in full dress uniform, began to play German marching tunes as loud as they could. In front of the band stood Siegfried Müller himself, with his trademark smile as wide as could be. As Akintola gingerly made his way down to the tarmac, Müller practically bounced over to greet him.\n\nFor a moment, the two hunters conversed jovially, before Müller escorted Akintola to the nearest Volkswagen. Within minutes, the car had travelled from the tarmac to the palace, where all the fineries of Africa were loaded upon the guest. Akintola himself had not seen such sheer wealth since the days of the English colonists, and even then he had only been a passive observer from afar. Even as the President, he had never had such fineries as the ones that were seemingly tossed at him.\n\nHowever, before he could truly get down to enjoying the riches of Zentralafrika, he found himself being practically dragged to the nearest helicopter by a seemingly ecstatic Müller. Before he knew it, they were in the air. Both men readied their rifles, eagerly awaiting the start of the hunt."

How many does that make?"\n\n"That's the 2nd rhino, and I got 2 lions earlier, so 4!"\n\n"God help me, I need to catch up!" Akintola laughed as he sighted another creature below the helicopter- a lion, perhaps? As he steadied his scope, he heard Müller speak behind him.\n\n"You know, Akintola, I was hoping that perhaps we could sell a few more anti-aircraft weapons to your army than normal, you know. Increase the order a little bit. What say you?"\n\nAnother crack split the air, and Akintola watched as the lion's head snapped back before the majestic beast staggered, its regal form holding itself high one last time before tipping over.\n\n"It's a deal.""

The doors swung open to reveal Müller and Akintola, with rifles held high in one hand and various animal corpses in the other. The smiles that crossed their faces as they dismounted from the helicopter were visible even from the other side of the runway. The attendants strained to catch the conversation between the two men as they made their away towards them.\n\n". . .always good to spend time in the Kongo- I must say, Müller, it was a pleasure to hunt with you."\n\n"The pleasure was all mine, President. How about another hunt sometime?"\n\n"Oh, of course."\n\n"I have always wanted a closer relationship with some of our West African neighbors. This is only the start, of course. Now, I believe you have a plane to catch."\n\nAkintola smiled again before lightly stepping up the staircase and into the airplane. In a few minutes, the runway was cleared and the plane rose gently off the ground. The last thing Akintola could make out on the ground before the plane rose above the clouds was the figure of Müller, still waving happily."

The various droplets of blood, brain matter, and other gore that comes with being violently killed had been cleaned extensively, though one could still spot a few faint stains of red if they looked hard enough. Akintola sat back and admired his handiwork. It had been quite the shot for a man like him, judging by the long, long time it had been since his last hunt. Not only that, he had made the shot from a helicopter, something he had never done before. Truly, it was an achievement.\n\nAnd yet, as he thought about the whole excursion, he couldn't help but wonder what the point of it was. Why did Müller invite him along, anyway? Was it really just to sell a few more rifles and guns? Did he really mean it when he said he wished to be closer to West Africa, or was he simply trying to impress? Was there another reason to all of this?\n\nOr did Müller just genuinely want a new friend?\n\nWhatever the reason, one thing that couldn't be questioned was the quality of the lion Akintola had shot. He decided he'd focus on that, rather than any pesky underlying motive. After all, how much could a simple hunting trip really mean?"

Müller did not expect much from the SS man, in terms of hunting, but perhaps he would surprise him on the trip.\n\nHe surprised Müller a lot earlier than he expected, when Müller opened the letter to see that he had turned the offer down.\n\nThe reasons given were, to put it lightly, vague. The short, concise prose typed onto the paper gave excuse after excuse, ranging from "A need to focus on work" to "a commitment to duty", which Müller could have interpreted as a genuine excuse or a thinly veiled insult. Whatever the reasons, the end result was clear- Mulamba would not be joining the trip. A disappointment, for sure, but how much fun could an SS man have been in the first place?"

Unlike Mulamba, who disguised his reasoning under layers of vague excuses, Lumumba made it plain and simple for Müller: His reputation as a man of the people would be irrevocably damaged if he was even seen with the Reichskommissar, let alone hunting with him. Such a blunt response surprised Müller- normally, when he was turned down, they at least made the effort to be kind about it. However, something about the sheer insolence of the letter amused him. It was rare to find a man so willing to stand up to Müller. With a chuckle masking his hint of disappointment, he tossed the letter to the side. It really was a shame that Lumumba would not come along- a man with the gall to refuse his overlord so readily would certainly be one Müller would like to meet."

In the corner of the smoke filled room, a wide-eyed native boy clutched a tuba and was butchering some piece of volkstümliche, rendering it almost wholly unrecognizable. Opposite him, one of Müller's French chefs set to a more literal sort of butchering, and was hard at work gutting the Kudu that Müller had stalked all morning. Steiner took in the scene, and realized in a passing moment of lucidity that what fazed him the most was the fact that absolutely none of these sights fazed him in the slightest.\n\n"God damn those lousy Swedes to whatever hell they still believe in." Müller slid the telegram to Steiner without even a hello. Steiner skimmed the details...a carefully planned rebel assault in Bukavu, 25 Swedish missionaries held for ransom, 7 native policemen dead already, and a full-scale hostage crisis underway. "Bukavu is on the border with the Ost... This should be Hüttig's problem, not ours. Won't he have the men to help, Steiner? All we have left that far north are the village idiots, and all they've managed to do is get themselves killed."\n\nSteiner had to stifle a laugh, passing it off as a cough amid the swirling cigar smoke. Even if Hüttig were able to send the men, he'd just as soon order them to shoot the missionaries first. Nordic Aryans who hadn't embraced the Reich? Who still looked to Christianity? And, worst of all, who still thought the natives had souls to save? If there was a boogeyman that kept Hüttig up at night, Steiner mused, that had to be damn close. "I'd suggest something more discreet, sir. Any official troop movements to the city risk worrying our other clients there, and open the door to rebel action elsewhere. Needless to say, the Swedes always pay us top dollar-and on time-for protection."\n\nMüller ashed his cigar and stood up, walking round the desk to place a hand on Steiner's shoulder. "The usual suspects it is, then. Let's send in the Kommandos. I'm sure you can sort this out, eh? After all, the customer is always right!" With a laugh, Müller grabbed his rifle and was out the door to his afternoon hunt in the vast steppes. But he had said enough, for Steiner knew just the man for the job..."

It would be a hard sell to move his 6 Kommando, comprised of native Kongolese commanded by Francophone officers, up to Bukavu. Born as a local defense unit, the Kommando had evolved into one of the most fearsome counterinsurgency forces in the country. But until now, they had fought for their homes and their families; what would motivate them to die for strangers from different tribes who didn't even speak French? Money was a factor, of course, but it paled in comparison to Le Colonel. Denard addressed his men with some stirring words as the skull-and-bones flag flew behind him, though it hardly mattered: his men would have followed Le Colonel anywhere. They loved him, just as he loved them. On arriving at the siege, the assault was slow and deliberate after careful reconnaissance and thorough planning. The rebels were flushed out, room by room, and none were allowed to escape. Afterwards, as Denard wrote his report, he shed a tear for each of his fallen men-too many-but kept his eye on his duty. His first draft of the report had dwelled in the details and casualty counts, but Denard wadded it up and threw it away. He was giving too much away; he knew his competitive advantage in this business was secrecy. Besides, it's not like those out-of-touch bureaucrats in Léopoldville would give a damn about what he wrote. He heard all the rumors, of course: that Müller often worked the whole night through, and even slept in his office rather than leave his post. But he knew the truth: out here, the only law was jungle law. After several drafts, he finally felt the message was crisp, curt, and vague enough to send.\n\nDenard had done an admirable job, for Müller had just enough time to read the report in between two shrimp cocktails at Friday's soirée with investors. Eyeing up his guests, he gave the note a perfunctory glance before checking the time-3AM already?-as he used the message to wipe the cocktail sauce off his fingers. He wadded it up and turned to face his guests, the music, and Frau Mindlehurst's stunning ass. By 6AM, he passed out drunk in his office as the dawn broke. He wouldn't leave until his tee time at noon."

 COG_mercs.3.desc:0 "There is an old Kongo saying that if one watches the Kongo River long enough, the bodies of one's enemies will eventually go floating by. When the river proves too slow, Major Hoare is always there to hurry things along-for the right price. His unit, 5 Kommando, affectionately known as "Hoare's Hessians," was a motley if all-white mix of Anglos displaced from Ostafrika and Germans out for loot, glory, or even just an honest paycheck. At Steiner's order, they screamed their way north in a lightning column of kubels and trucks. The men were in for a bumpy ride--but it was nothing compared to the hell awaiting the rebels in Bukavu. Shock and awe was the order of the day, and on arrival the assault was immediate and overwhelming. But when the rebels finally broke and ran, Hoare immediately ordered his men to cease fire. After all, the more that fled today, the more work there would be for his men in the future. And yet, as always, one or two of the hotheads kept up the fire, eager for one more kill. When the missionaries were freed at last, they rushed out to greet their gallant heroes. The photos of that day would show them hugging and cheering their German-born liberators, but Hoare was too engrossed in his writing to care. He quickly dashed out a short and vague report to Steiner, saving the juiciest details for his memoirs, of course. Today, it might be his Aryan troops who were in the spotlight, but he would ensure that years from now, history would remember his words, his deeds, and his books. Until then, it was just another day, and just another paycheck."

 COG_mercs.4.t:0 "Trouble in Bakuvu - Jimmy's Report"
 COG_mercs.4.desc:0 ""Jimmy", as his men knew him, never bothered to submit a report back to Léopoldville. Instead, word had come from a furious King Mwambutsa of the Tutsi, who had stormed into the halls of Adolf Hitler Palast demanding an audience with Müller. Fortunately, Steiner found the king first and with an amicable wave, ushered him into a parlor for a drink and a chat. By the end of their meeting, Steiner was the one who needed a drink (or four) to settle himself. It was true that Müller was in no state to receive the king; but nobody could have been prepared to hear the stories of terror which he brought from up north. "Les Affreux", as Jimmy's men called themselves, were a gang of Belgian deserters, criminals, and drifters known for their shoot-first, ask-questions later attitude. They were the fastest and the cheapest option that Steiner had to solve his problem, but it was unclear they had even done what they had been paid for. Sure, they had broken the siege, by pulling up and unloading every gun they had into the church before burning it to the ground. Many of the clergy were killed in the crossfire or the blaze, and several of the survivors, men and women alike, were raped-it remains unclear just who was responsible. A few of the rebels managed to get away, but their respite was short-lived. Les Affreux tracked them down and torched every village they found harboring even a single rebel, before taking whatever or whoever they wanted for themselves and gunning down the rest.\n\nFor now, the rebel problem was solved, but a worse one had emerged in its wake. Hatred for the whites was at a fever pitch in the region; for every rebel dead today, ten more stood poised to take up the fight. Furthermore, Les Affreux were on the loose, and Steiner knew as well as anyone that these were broken men, driven by the shock of losing first their colony, and then their homeland, their families, and their very culture itself to Burgundy. Without a chance to take their hatred out on the Germans, they eased their pain with every native gored on their bayonets, every child's face pounded into the muck under their jackboots, and with every orgasm taken at gunpoint. Steiner paused to consider the irony. If the rumors were true, these men-if they could still be called that-would have felt utterly at home back in the Burgundy they so despised."

 COG_mercs.5.t:0 "Diamond Conveying Mission"
 COG_mercs.5.desc:0 "Mining in the Kongo is primarily conducted by 3 corporations: BCK, UMHK, and the Forminère. However, one true force dominates above all others: violence. From forcibly conscripted labor, to the hellish working conditions and the scars on the earth which the mines leave behind-danger abounds, and no one escapes unharmed. But the most dangerous job of all is transporting products along the colony's rickety jungle roads to the ports of the Kongo Meer. Considering the staggering number of mercenaries employed as guards and overseers, these trips often turn into firefights as the three leading companies license their men to engage in a bloody form of cutthroat competition, while paying us to look the other way.\n\nFor critical missions, like moving Uranium, the state will provide airlift or SS troops. But in all other circumstances, companies have to pay for the privilege of hiring out security. Private wars demand private armies...but there's nothing stopping us from making a quick buck on the side as a middleman. To that end, Forminère has just requested we provide security for an upcoming diamond convoy from Kasai, and were kind enough to forward a rather large "insurance copayment." All of the major mercenaries have permanent contracts with one firm or the others, so we will have to turn to more minor outfits to meet their needs.\n\nBob Denard, a major Forminère contractor, has recommended the eager French Officer Philippe Erulin and his group of paratroopers experienced in unconventional warfare. Then there's "Duck" van der Linde; a relative newcomer who has recently crossed the border from South Africa to enter the business. He has already made quite a name for himself for his bravery in combat, and this mission could be his big break. Finally, there's the more conservative Pat Smith, a by-the-book if uncreative officer we've long employed to train our local troops, and who has always proven capable of following his orders to a Tee."

 COG_mercs.6.t:0 "Diamond Conveying Mission - Erulin's Report"
 COG_mercs.6.desc:0 "In concert with secret intelligence from Denard, Captain Philippe Erulin devised a strategy he called "Le Troyen", which consisted of positioning most of his small band of heavily armed men in unremarkable trucks masquerading as part of the Forminère convoy. At each mine, he had the cargo trucks pick up crates of blasting explosives rather than diamonds. Finally, on some dusty road, the long-awaited ambush arrived as two armed men ran into the path of the lead truck. They demanded the driver stop, and he meekly complied, exiting his vehicle with his hands above his head.\n\nAs one man led the captured driver toward the jungle, a group of mercs left their positions in the treeline to search the truckbed and capture the rest of the convoy. Once enough of them were near, Erulin triggered the explosives in the back of the now-empty lead truck as his men poured out of their vehicles, launching a counter-ambush of their own. In a few minutes, the robbery had devolved into a rout. Erulin ordered his men to slacken their fire; these were fellow mercs, after all. Besides, he needed his opponents alive for his plan to come to fruition.\n\nIt worked brilliantly, as word spread like brushfire that Forminère was booby-trapping its trucks. The psychological damage far outstripped the losses that Eurlin had inflicted on the BCK and UHMK. Forminère got its convoy through, and then the next five, and within a few months felt confident enough to actually start running convoys without escorts. Fear alone had become the deterrent. Ironically, it seemed like the threat of extreme violence may be what finally put an end to the endless mercenary raids. This could never be allowed to stand, of course; the idea of the companies reaping all of the Congo's vast profits for themselves without paying for protection? Impossible! Steiner sent the telegrams himself: to observers in Germania, they seemed to be innocuous customs regulations on the private movement of blasting explosives. To the companies on the ground, they suddenly made the Le Troyen approach cost prohibitive. Within a few days, the ambush rate-and funding for the government-had spiked to unprecedented levels."

 COG_mercs.7.t:0 "Diamond Conveying Mission - Duck's Report"
 COG_mercs.7.desc:0 "When the soldier waltzed into the Forminère camp and demanded to see the mercenary leader, Duck knew he had problems. First, somehow this disheveled man had managed to slip past his sentries unnoticed. Brave as they may be, many of Duck's men were inexperienced youngsters, out for adventure or fortune but with very little practical knowledge of soldiering. Second, the fact this man had found their camp at all suggested the enemy knew more about Duck than he did about them.\n\nThe man was a deserter, and he claimed the UMHK task force was just a day's march away, ready to ambush the convoy as soon as it left camp. If he'd get a cut of the diamonds, he'd guide Duck and his men to the spot during a night raid to clear a path for the convoy.\n\nAlmost as soon as the platoon set out that night, the plan went to hell. Suddenly guns roared from the jungle on all sides as the "deserter" slipped off to join his comrades, now laying into the South Africans with a hellish crossfire. Duck realized the only way out of the ambush was to charge through it, back down the jungle path where they had come. He drew his machete, called for the retreat, and took up point leading his men back to safety. By the time the unit returned to camp, half their men were missing, including many carrying modern battle rifles.\n\nAs dawn broke the next morning, Duck's men, cradling old wartime bolt-action rifles or even homemade muskets, looked out onto a ring of mercenaries on all sides. A solitary figure swaggered up the dirt road toward the surrounded camp, as the UMHK mercenary leader stepped forward to offer his terms of surrender."That was a brave thing you did, kid, but it's hopeless to fight us off. Hand over the diamonds, and we'll let you out alive. We will be ruined from getting a contract of your own if you surrender, but I tell you what; you're brave sons-of-bitches, and you treated my infiltrator well. How's about you come work for me?" The idea of fighting under those who had killed their friends mere hours ago churned the men's stomach...until they saw many of their presumably lost comrades smiling from the enemy ranks, eagerly training their guns onto the camp along with all the rest of the UMHK goons. As the wages on offer kept going up and up, the fortune these men had left their homes to seek suddenly seemed achievable. Finally, Duck himself walked out to clasp the officer's hand.\n\nMajor Hoare smiled. Another successful contract for UMHK, and another competitor knocked out of the business. Duck and his men would make fine additions to his company after the losses he took in his last op against BCK."

 COG_mercs.8.t:0 "Diamond Conveying Mission - Pat's Report"
 COG_mercs.8.desc:0 "As the convoy sped down the road, a Panzerfaust roared past one of the vehicles. A near miss, but a clear signal to Pat Smith to order his mostly native men to open fire. The thump-thump-thump of grenade launchers joined the ear-piercing rattles of MG 42's as the convoy picked up speed. Rather than stand and fight, Pat's thought not of glory, but of the client; getting the diamonds out of the killzone was his highest priority. That ceased to be an option, however, when the ambushers blew their charges and the trees nearest to the road came tumbling down.\n\nThis was a dramatic and unusual escalation. These kinds of mercenary raids were often quick and decisive, a gentlemanly sort of affair. In a world where you never knew who tomorrow's business partner would be, the goal was to complete the contract, not to wipe out the other side. But Major Hoare and his all-white Kommando wanted to send a message to Denard and the rest of his cronies at Forminère: don't send a native to do a white man's job.\n\nIn Smith, however, Hoare had found a worthy match. He had trained his natives well, and even as their casualties mounted in the crossfire, they held firm. Smith knew that Hoare couldn't spare as many losses as he could, for white replacements were so much harder to come by. Finally, after almost a two hour firefight, Hoare's men silently crept back into the jungle, dragging their wounded with them. Smith stood from behind the smoldering Kubel where he'd taken cover. His unit was down to half its normal effectives-much higher casualties than typical in these engagements-and several of the vehicles were inoperable. But the cargo was safe, at least until Hoare had regrouped. Smith knew he had to hurry. He wiped his brow and barked orders to his men to clear the roadblock ahead and load the diamonds into the remaining trucks. As he did so, the cynical adage so familiar to mercenaries sprang into his ears:"

A few soldiers bearing assault rifles welcomed them into a bustling camp.\n\nColonel Denard remembered his first time visting a guerilla camp. A chokingly humid morning in the Congo, the sun beating down. Soldiers laid on beds of straw as mosquitoes swarmed them. A few jerked left and right in their heat-induced stupor. A tattered flag sat on a wooden pole. Someone barked out orders, to no avail.\n\nThe camp Denard visited that day was nothing of the like: it was better described as a town in the forest. Women came and went, carrying pots on their heads full of herbs, water, and a brownish liquid with the sickly smell of banana beer. Men with rifles slung on their back practically skipped around. Lead through the hustle and bustle of a saturday morning in the Congo, Denard saw the familiar face of his aquantaince, Gotefroid Munongo. The two exchanged pleasantries, and Denard introduced his reason of being.\n\n"Gotefroid, you must understand, there is some concern about the recent rumblings of the union. Is there any chance you could - pull some strings?\n\nTo his surprise, Gotefroid did not pause for even a moment. "Anything for my good friend, Colonel. Now, have you ever tried the famous banana beer of our camp?"\n\n"Well, I have not, but we should really -" Gotefroid butted in. "You really must have some!" Turning to his left, he yelled out for some beer.\n\nDenard failed to remember much after the first sip, and when he sat down to right a formal report he was shocked to find out exactly how much he could not recall.

"This was everything I expected Africa to be, and more! Beautiful scenery, endless jungle, tropical beaches, wildlife everywhere, there's nowhere else like it!"\n\n"Mmm-hmm," agreed Gerd as he concentrated on the road.\n\n"I cannot decide what I liked the best," Elisabeth thought aloud. "The lake was so vast and pretty, and its beaches had such amazing cliffs and endless beaches of sand. The rooms at the resort were nice and well-maintained, more than I thought a room in Africa could be. And the pool and spa were so nice! I loved going there while you and the Reichskommissar were, well...what were you doing with the Reichskommissar?"\n\n"Hunting."\n\n"Ah yes, how silly of me to forget. Hunting! Oh, and the restaurant was fantastic! All those weird, foreign foods, like the river prawns, or the Poulet à la moambé, or the bean stew, or even the steamed pumpkin seed pudding! But there was always some schnitzel to fall back on if we didn't want to try the snails. Did you like the trip, darling?"\n\n"Yes," said Gerd.\n\n"Well, what was your favorite part?"\n\nGerd thought it over. "The highway. From Léopoldville to here. Surprisingly very nice, very modern. Impressive.""

 COG_misc.9.desc:0 "Erich von Manstein peered out of the window of the military air vehicle he was travelling in. His gaze fell on the vast range of the reflecting lake and retreating rainforests on the horizon. He wondered what wonderful creatures might stalk these grounds. He laid back in his seat to enjoy the last minutes of careless thoughts, seizing the opportunity to find the peacefulness of the rattling aircraft. Soon his thoughts can rest entirely.\n\n"Generalfeldmarschall, we are preparing for touch-down", an officer jerked him from drowsing. He sighed. His vacation is finally about to begin. The Wehrmacht, his constant and reliable employer, gratefully provided the vehicle to bring him to the fabled lands of Afrika. On the advice of fellow officers, he heavily endeavored to visit Reichskommissar Müller, a reportedly gregarious host. Just the right place to spend some time away from the stressful Reich proper.\n\nThe touch-down of the aircraft sends a spasm of pain through his weary joints. Having stopped the aircraft, the pilot insisted on personally accompanying Manstein embarking. The welcome reception was surprisingly grand, an honor guard and several journalists. A military official approached him with long strides. "Sieg Heil", he saluted passionately, groping for Manstein's hand. \n"Generalfeldmarschall, my name is Oberst Rolf Steiner. The personal envoy of our mutual friend, the Reichskommissar. Sent to receive you accordingly. I am his deputy in matters of highest regard and am overwhelmingly pleased to meet the Hero of the East." Manstein escaped his grope.\n\n"A pleasure to meet you, Oberst. Stories of you and your Reichskommissar's adventures have reached my ear as well. Please, send my regards," Manstein responded. \n"Oh, no. You will meet him. Siegfried would be damned to miss an opportunity to hunt with such a highly regarded figure as you. He personally planned an extravagant trip along his favorite hunting spot", Steiner came closer, "he normally keeps them for himself." The Oberst turned and gesticulated towards a great helicopter. "The finest rooms in our splendid hotels have been prepared for your trip, Generalfeldmarschall.""

He sat in the cool breeze of the airstream provided by the speed of the jeep. He gazed towards the constantly accelerating image of the shiny gargantuan lake Hitlersstadt stood next to. He laid his rifle away and smiled at the two German hunting companions provided to him after Siegfried Müller's departure a day ago.\n\nWhat a beautiful land this is. So full of mysterious splendor, so full of surprises. Von Manstein visited many places in his old days. Europe was dreary compared to this. He has always been a martial man, but nowhere on earth provided him with so much joy and laughter at shooting. And nowhere on earth has he seen such numerous and interesting game.\n\nThe hunts might only have been half as joyful without Siegfried Müller, whom he was fast friends with. He boasted great knowledge and experience with these creatures. Though a bit too jovial in places, he was a great host all in all. The tour through the country was absorbing as well. They were spoiled, however, by the deviations they brought to the hunts. In fact, von Manstein, he was just told, spoke with the same eager as Siegfried Müller when he asked his companions this morning to go on a last private hunt. He felt like he regained some of his zeal and vigor.\n\nNow, however, the time is rife to take his leave. While he will enjoy the comfortable lake hotel one last time, his trophies will be embarked on the aircraft already. While he will enjoy a tropical cuisine one last time, farewells must be said to newfound friends.\nWhile he has not even taken his leave yet, he already considers a trip to Südwestafrika and Ostafrika to uncover the whole splendor of the continent already."

Just lay low, smile to whoever sees you, and if you're taken on a hunt, tell them you're having a lovely time."\n\nSpeer forced a smile. "That seems... acceptable, I suppose. As long as I get some time to settle down and read."\n\nHe leant back and stared at the airplane window, at the lush forests and mystifying jungles. To many, this would be a vista to boggle the mind, but to him, it was misery incarnate. His father's grand plan was no boondoggle, clearly, considering how adored Speer Junior was to much of the public. The intelligent son, as raised by a genius father, oh, how wonderful! Now, he had to handle being shipped to Africa, to deal with Müller's hunting gang, to make friends in the colonies for his dear, dear father.\n\nThe private jet set down on Léopoldville's airstrip. Speer donned his sunglasses as he saw two men waiting as he exited the jet. The first he recognised immediately, a brilliant smile shining across his face. The great war hero and the buoyant leader of Zentralafrika, Siegfried Müller. The second he knew only from discreet conversations with the nameless officials, whispering of administration and dealings. This was Rolf Steiner.\n\nMüller introduced himself first, with as much pomp and extravagance as could be expected. Steiner stood by idly, before giving Speer a firm handshake and inviting him into their limousine where they'd be taking him to his place of residence. Within the car, Müller glanced at Speer. "Do you enjoy hunts, Herr Speer?"\n\nSpeer put his fake smile back on. "It's not my favourite activity, but I don't have a particular issue with it."\n\nMüller grinned excitedly.

The benefit to the trip, of course, was some time alone, away from the arduous lifestyle of being a posterboy for his father's own plots. He stepped up, and walked to the edge of the lake, and looked across it.\n\nGod, the view was breathtaking. Hundreds of miles of pure water, created by the party itself. A beautiful vista, stretching across the ground, as the sun burned in the sky. The trees shook lightly in the warm breeze, and the air had a cool smell. However, the atmosphere was still dark to Speer. He sighed, and turned around.\n\nThe resort of Hitlersstadt itself was designed rather badly. Was the place built by utter amateurs? It was just too much; clearly a slipshod attempt, to make a building look impressive without understanding good aesthetics. There were random parts jutting out everywhere, and the facaderont was a giant, confused mess. But now wasn't the time for architectural analysis...after all, everyone looked happy."

However, one such notification did recently reach the desk of the Reichskommissar, specifically that famed partisan and terrorist Mombotu Sese Seko has been spotted near Bangui, in the northeast of the colony.\n\nBorn Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, Sese Seko was joined the Zentalafrikan SS at an early age, and quickly earned a reputation for his intelligence, leadership, and fervor. Mobotu seemed destined to rise as high as his race would permit him until he unexpectedly vanished into the jungle along with his entire unit and a vast quantity of arms and ammunition. Shortly after, he changed his name and developed a different reputation -- of one of the most ruthless and capable insurgent warlords in the region.\n\nWhile many of the rebels proclaim allegiance to Bolshevism, Democracy, or one of the many pithy ethnic groups perpetually squabbling for prominence, Mombotu appears to fight only for himself. His fighters are famed for greed and steal whatever they can find from German colonists and African natives alike.\n\nMany of our best men have been hunting Mobutu for months. That he has been spotted at last suggests that the ground might finally be shrinking beneath his feet. We can only hope that this dire threat to our interests will finally be eliminated."

A combination shotgun and big game rifle, it was manufactured by Sauer & Sohn during the Second Weltkrieg as a survival rifle for Luftwaffe bomber crews, evidentially so they could participate in some game hunting as they wasted away in the North African desert. Müller had decided to take it out today to see if it performed about as well as he remembered from when he first tried it out several years ago.\n\nHe took two 12 gauge shells and one 9.3x74mmR round from the box, inserting the shells in the top two barrels and the rimmed cartridge on the bottom one. Snapping it shut, he then began to wait for a flock of birds to pass overhead for him to test on. They would be here, he was sure of it. They had been chirping relentlessly this morning. As he focused his attention on listening for the birds, he almost missed hearing the clerk running up with a document, calling out "it's from Mbuyi Mayi!"\n\nWithout a word, Müller took the dispatch as the clerk, panting, explained "the mine's a total collapse...lots of casualties...they don't know how bad it is, but..."\n\n"God fucking damn it!" bellowed Müller. "Those fucks at MIBA can't even dig a ditch in their backyards, can they? Now our biggest diamond mine is fucked because they can't go three meters underground without caving in their own operation! It's all fucked!"\n\nAs to accentuate his point, the M30 went off, launching a round of indeterminate caliber into the trees at the edge of Müller's property. All that he and the clerk knew was that a large amount of foliage was rustled, causing a number of the previously sought-after birds to immediately take flight. This mutual shock allowed Müller to clear his head.\n\n"Get that Belgian company on the line, and tell them I want answers," he said. The clerk agreed and ran off."

But it's really about his experience with the Panzer divisions during Barbarossa and with the Afrika Korps down there."\n\nThe other staffer was shocked, like his co-worker had just admitted to being a member of Antifa.

He wasn't there, he should at least have the decency to keep his mouth shut, let alone criticize the ones who fought and died there!"\n\nThe first staffer was taken aback by the sudden hostility from the fellow staffer. "I'm not defending his opinions, in fact, I think he could have been a bit more mindful with his words. But he is a general who is held in high esteem by a bunch of people. He did win the Knight's Cross, so he's well entitled to his opinion."\n\n"My thoughts exactly," said a third voice. The young staffers were shocked when they saw who it was.\n\nFormer Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel stepped between the staffers and began to pour himself a cup of coffee from the coffeemaker. "I was with von Thoma from September of 1942 until the end of the war. During his time under my command, I never knew him to be anything but a dutiful and effective commander." Setting the pot back in the machine, he looked at the staffers and said "If he has an opinion on the greatest disaster in German military history since 1918, then I believe his advice must be taken into account."\n\nRommel took a sip and walked away.

As the hatch to the aircraft opened, Müller knew it was time to perform. The economic future of Zentralafrika was at stake.\n\nThe first sight of the man as he exited the aircraft made Müller a bit nervous. He carried himself well, and was surprisingly sharp-looking for a person who was getting off a straight flight from Germany. As soon as Hermann Abs stepped off of the aircraft, Müller approached him with an outstretched hand and a forced smile, saying "Herr Abs, I'm Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller. It's a pleasure to meet-"\n\n"The pleasure is all mine, Reichskommissar," said Abs as he grabbed Müller's hand and gave it a strong shake, pulling in close to look him in the eyes. "I heard a lot about you, and your exploits during the war with Cameroon."\n\nThat was a shock, and Müller scarcely was able to keep a hold on the situation. What did he expect Abs to be like? Another cold and disinterested individual who just wanted to see some production facilities and a few figures before they went back to Germany. But Abs was friendly. And that was good, but something was off about it.\n\n"Well, that's very nice to hear, Herr Abs. My private helicopter is waiting to take us to my palace where we will discuss the economic situation of Zentralafrika."\n\n"Please, Reichskommissar, call me Hermann. And I expect we will go hunting later?"\n\nAnd then Müller knew what was going on. Abs seemed friendly, charismatic, even. But as surely as Müller was pretending to be formal to impress Abs, Abs was trying to be imposing to get Müller off his guard. And Müller did not know if Abs had looked through the facade he was putting up already.\n\n"If we have the time," Müller said, as he realized this was going to be a difficult game of charades."

Steiner tried to work around it with some small talk, but he knew Abs could see the question coming.\n\nMight as well get it over with. "So, you're finishing up your vacation today," he said, trying to make it sound as innocent and casual as possible. "What do you think of Zentralafrika?"\n\nAbs chewed on a piece of Strudel for a minute. "It has the largest number of American corporations in the Pakt, that's for sure," he said. "And far more Japanese corporations too. That's one thing you don't seem to put in your pamphlets to impress investors. I think that if you keep it up and continue to be a free and open market, you will have a bright economic future."\n\nBut are you going to play a part in that,Steiner asked silently. And it seemed Abs heard him.\n\n"If you got a handle on the volatility, you might look even better," Abs said. "The security situation with the natives does have room for improvement. And aren't you the security minister? If you get the situation under control in the next few years, you can call me and Deutsche Bank, and we will invest in your operation down here." Both were silent as he finished his breakfast.\n\n"If you excuse me, I have a meeting with the Economic Minister, von Broich, before I leave for Germany. One that I am very much looking forward to."

A few commercial planes were there, as well as a few helicopters and the occasional private jet. But not like many of the other airports of the Pakt, especially the ones in Germany, which were far busier.\n\nHe noticed the reception party. A group of flunkies. And the Reichskommissar, what's-his-name. They were trying to greet him, like so many others. He gave them a small gesture of greeting. That's all they would get in return. He didn't care about formality or any fancy procedure. He just wanted to see if they had gotten him what he wanted.\n\nThere it was. A private car. Wonderful. Perhaps Africa was not full of arrogant backwards failures as he had heard. There might even be a few who could follow orders all the time. He walked toward it, ignoring the reception, while a few porters carried his bags from the modest aircraft he arrived in.\n\nThe keys were in the ignition, just like he told them to. He popped the trunk, so his bags could be packed. Once that was done, he turned on the motor. Well, not everything was perfect.

One could find a place like that in many of the other areas of the Reich. But those hotels would make use of the local populace, while this one would not. The servers, the housekeeping, the clerks, the bellhops, the doorman, all were white. Even the gardener was white! The only natives he saw in Hitlerstadt were outside the facility, free to do whatever they were doing.\n\nThis outraged him to no end. These impoverished natives were defecating, copulating, living in squalor all over this wretched colony. And the resort still insisted on importing German or Belgian labor and making them do menial tasks? Who approved this? If it were up to him, these tasks would be assigned to the races who were best to handle them. It would be easier, and a lot cheaper, too.\n\nAnd that Reichskommissar, Müller. What was the problem with him? Never businesslike. Always pestering Flick and getting him to go somewhere, usually an expedition to hunt in the middle of a godforsaken jungle. Well, at least the pestering died down after a few days. Not that that helped the business much. It was a poor place, he decided. One that he would certainly complain about to his friends in the SS and the NSDAP.\n\nAnd so left Freidrich Flick. A man who would leave behind a unique legacy in Zentralafrika, one not shared anywhere else in the Reich.

To start with, there had been no official ceremony at the airport and in fact, the only people who had even been there to greet the incoming Reichswerke official were the Reichskommissar himself along with his deputy Rolf Steiner. The Reichskommissar, Geilenberg almost muttered out loud as he, from the back of the open-topped kübelwagen the former soldier turned colonial administrator seemed to use as a personal vehicle, eyed his new host. He was as handsome as the press always liked to say but the seasoned bureaucrat detected something else, something that disconcerted him. It was the stench of apathy.\n\nHe remembered the way Müller first greeted him as he stepped off the plane, not with the customary "Sieg Heil!" and salute of a true NSDAP adherent but with a bearhug and a slap on the back of all things. Why, if a subordinate in the Werke had even dared to think of such a gesture as appropriate he would have found himself at the edges of the Moskovien territories. It also had not escaped him that neither Steiner nor Müller were wearing the garb of colonial administration he had seen before in photos or even on visiting officials back in the Fatherland. The two were not even wearing their standard Wehrmacht uniforms even, but khaki-beige getups that looked more appropriate for big game hunters than servants of the Reich.\n\n"So Edmund," the deeply tanned Reichskommissar began, turning back to face his now-fidgeting guest, "Do you hunt at all?" Geilenberg noted with an inward disgust that the man was already using such a familiar tone and mode of address and was barely able to mumble something about geese back home without openly sneering before Steiner cut in. "Mr. Geilenberg, just wait until you get a look-see at the Reichskommissar's hunting lodge! He's actually got a hunt going tonight and we'd love to have you as our official guest!" My God, Geilenberg thought to himself, so that's what they've been doing all this time, just playing around like schoolboys on a day off.

With a sinking feeling, it dawned on the industrialist that that was exactly what it was. A relic of bygone time with an owner to match, a man content to hunt beasts like some kind of reincarnation of Major G.H. Anderson while the world crumbled around him.\n\nThe thought of such a man being entrusted with such vast reserves of resources just under his boots depressed him to no end, and by supper time Geilenberg was despondent, barely even acknowledging the attempts at conversation by either Müller or Steiner. Eventually, either out of boredom with their guest's lack of engagement or due to the calling of some pointless revelry the two left the poor man alone to brood, wishing he were back in Germania. Or at least he thought he was alone, and that was why he almost jumped out of his seat when a voice much more professional than the Reichskommissar but no less amicable invited him to some tea. In his black mood he had completely forgotten about the other officer present, but he now had a companion who seemed to actually take himself seriously both as a representative of the Vaterland as a host.\n\nWilhelm Ritter von Thoma was every bit the gentleman and easy companion Geilenberg had heard he was and more. For the first time since he had stepped foot in this otherwise pathetic administration's boundaries, he felt happy enough to talk. Talk they did, well into the night they sat in the lodge's main smoking room, enjoying tea and stories about the general's time at war that took him from the mountains of Spain to the sands of North Africa and beyond.

That's what he lived for. The hunt.\n\nMüller flashed a devilish grin, while the thrill often came from hunting the predator, Müller was not one to discriminate. The prey was just as valuable. Bringing the binoculars to his eyes, the tattered tan figure in the distance confirmed his suspicions, rebels lurked in the underbrush. He lifted the scope to his eye and trained on the target in the distance. He bit his lip in concentration. The far-distant figure stumbled slowly through the grass, the pitiful scene brought a frown to the hunter, hunting wounded animals was no fun at all. Quickly, this devolved from a hunting trip to business, and how he loathed business. He shifted his weight and readied his finger on the trigger. One. Two. Three. Bang!\n\nThe figure spurted blood. Another success. Müller grinned as he took his eyes away from- wait. He fired a second time. The rebel crawled on the sand still, despite blood pouring two ways. Either this man was resilient or he... huh. Müller peered closer. His legs hadn't moved at all. How the...?\n\nLike a Zippo snapping open, things clicked into place. The bloody lump was no target; no, that went to his buddy using his carcass as a meat shield! "Well I'll be damned," chuckled the hunter under his breath.\n\nThe jungle follows no law but the fittest's survival.

And so, behind a boulder, both father and son watched the lion yawn, stand and skulk away from the rest.

Only father and son bore witness to the sight of strange men with strange clothes bursting from the bird's bright red belly. They crowded around the dead lion's carcass, laughing and shouting in stranger tongues. One man stepped forward to hoist the lion's blood-covered neck. In an instant, another formed lighting from his hands -- right onto the beast's head.\n\nInstincts regained, the hunter pulled at his son as they snuck away from the menace that had upturned their lives. No matter the awe they inspired in the frolicked pleasure with which they toyed the mighty beast's corpse, these men were clearly dangerous. Far more dangerous than the creatures he hunts."

 COG_misc.26.desc:0 "Zentralafrika's native SS units and its infamous mercenaries have always had a strained relationship, and hostility between the two groups is not uncommon. One such incident took place in the town of Demba.\n\nA dozen German mercenaries confronted a squad of 20 native soldiers garrisoned in the town, insisting that they lay down their arms and allow the mercenaries to take charge of the town's defense (with proper compensation, of course). The natives refused and insisted the Germans leave the town immediately or face imprisonment. They were responded to with a salvo of friendly fire.\n\nTo the mercenaries' surprise, the natives scarcely proved as the unmotivated cowards their ringleader had assumed; rather, they faced well-aimed and well-spaced shots from a hundred different directions. Two minutes later, four mercenaries lay dead on the streets. The other eight were disarmed and marched at gunpoint to the town jail.\n\nThe squad sergeant presented his prisoners to the Demba garrison's captain soon after. He and his men expected praise for saving the town from bandits; instead, they received scorn from a man whose worst fears had come true. After all, these "subhumans" had used the weapons and training Germany had provided them to murder four members of the "master race". Despite facing 20 armed men in his office, the captain told each that they were stripped of their ranks and hung forthwith.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, the sergeant drew his pistol and shot the captain's balding head point blank.\n\nDemba's German guards was swift, but not swift enough. A running gun battle through the streets left three more Germans and five of the natives dead, as well as eight civilians caught in the crossfire. By day's end the remaining 15 had escaped into the jungle.\n\nAs his first act days later, the town garrison's new captain hired the eight German mercenaries into the town guard."

All you Force Publique dogs are the same!" the old man called back, defiance in his voice.\n\nProvoked, the SS stormed over to the old man until they were inches from his wizened face. "And what makes you think you know us, old man? You don't even know what year it is!"\n\n"Oh, I know all right," he replied. "Father tapped rubber veins for old Leopold when the Force Publique gave me this!" He held out his left arm and rolled down the sleeve, revealing a gnarled nub of flesh where a hand should be. "A reminder for my father to work harder, they said. The man who took my hand was black, but he did it because a white man paid him to. Just like you."\n\n"We're nothing like those dogs!" shouted the irate squad leader. "The Germans put them in their place!"\n\n"Oh, did they?" the old man spat out. "So do they treat the Belgians more like us, or more like their own? I still see Belgian judges, Belgian tax men, Belgian foremen, Belgian officers. Maybe it's the Germans who pay their salaries now! And you're the same, too! Different faces, yes, but always the same, always the white man's macaque-"\n\nThe squad leader swung his rifle around and drove the stock into the noisy shriveled zak's stomach, doubling him over. The rest of the men joined in with their fists and boots, not stopping until he was a wheezing, bloody wreck on the ground. Sated, the guards swiveled around and stormed out of the village."

They came from all over the Reich, stacking their hulls with Zentralafrika's raw bounty for the Pakt's insatiable factories and people. There were other vessels too, he noticed. Plenty of Italian and Iberian ones. One or two from Japan. Another seemed to hoist Indian flags. And that one...\n\nHe frowned. Schaefer thought he remembered the ship from somewhere. One stack, one superstructure. Two masts forward, one aft. But it couldn't be that type, that was an American one! Just to make sure, he took out his binoculars and took a look. No flag on the stern, and the name...\n\nA chill went up his spine as he remembered where he had last seen the ship. The same signs, even. He was younger back then, a couple pay grades lower. It wasn't in the Southern Atlantic through a pair of binoculars, it was in the middle of the North Atlantic through a periscope. He only had a moment to focus on it before the captain ordered a crash dive to save the Boot from a salvo of depth charges. Now, he had time to focus on it as long as he needed.\n\nHis first thought was to call it in, but then he quashed the breath in his throat. Schafer heard rumors that Americans were coming in with the Reichskommissar's permission. Blowing his whistle now might end his career. And as he thought about it, why should he go after the vessel? It was here to do business like everyone else -- no more, no less. America and Germany were at peace now. Perhaps this vessel's mission would bring the two nations a bit closer together.

When he was six or seven, he asked why the white family lived in the big house, while the black families like his lived in huts and shacks. When he was ten, he asked why, if his people had gods before, the missionaries were so eager to replace them. And when he was fourteen, he asked why he'd have to work in the mines for several hours a day while the engineers sat in an air-conditioned office for half that time.\n\nAnd the answer was always the same; by the circumstances of his birth, Mwenze was inferior.\n\nIt never sat well with Mwenze, but he eventually accepted it. Some things he couldn't change, he thought. The master race they said will rule the world now ruled over him and his. He was stuck doing their bidding, with no say in the matter -- but that was just how it was. An Aryan was good for ruling the world; a native like him was good only for lifting a hundredweight of dirt.\n\nMwenze thought the army would be more of the same: black grunts doing hard, dirty work while white officers sat under their pavilions miles away. But the longer he served, the more the world had changed his mind. Time in the army gave him French mercenaries dragging a truck along the mud like any native, and them asking for his help. Time in the army gave him natives like he charging towards a hail of bullets while their white SS comrades cowered in a ditch -- so much for the "fearless master race". And time in the army gave him and his native men victories against the white Americans and South Africans. Far from giving him more of the same, the army instead gave Mwenze strength and pride.\n\nMaybe the white man was wrong, Mwenze thought. The army showed him natives can be just as talented and accomplished as whites, perhaps moreso. They can be mechanics, tank drivers, perhaps even pilots. And they can lead from the fore as well. Perhaps, after the war, Mwenze would flaunt his newfound pride. And he had the skills and weaponry to back up everything he said..."
