 ### 지도자 설명 ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "1917년 태어나면서부터 망명 생활을 한 블라디미르 키릴로비치 로마노프 대공은 아버지이자 사망한 차르 니콜라이 2세의 사촌인 키릴 블라디미로비치가 1938년 죽은 후 망명 러시아 황가의 수장이 되었습니다.\n\n제2차 세계 대전 당시 브르타뉴에 거주하던 블라디미르는 얼마 가지 못해 가족과 함께 독일에게 구류되었습니다. 곧 블라디미르는 독일 당국의 '강요'로 러시아인들에게 소비에트 정권에서 망명하기를 권하는 라디오 방송을 하며 부역을 시작했습니다. 전쟁이 끝날 때는 우크라이나 섭정직을 제안 받았지만, 러시아의 분열이라는 받아들일 수 없는 결과를 불러올 직위를 거절했습니다.\n\n하지만, 전쟁이 끝나도 블라디미르는 러시아로 돌아갈 수 없었습니다. 독일인들은 블라소프 때처럼 블라디미르의 인기가 독일 통치를 약화시킬까 걱정했습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 벌어진 뒤에야 독일인들을 설득할 수 있었던 블라디미르는 왕정주의자와 백계 망명자들로 이루어진 사단 하나를 만들어 매우 성공적인 역습을 이끌었습니다. 국방군 공세가 멈출 때 블라디미르는 멈추지 않고 그대로 돌파해 러시아에 왕정주의자들이 지배하는 고립 구역을 만들었습니다.\n\n이후 몇 년 동안, 새로 선포된 차르 블라디미르 3세는 자신의 구역을 별로 확장하지 못했고, 수많은 내부의 골칫거리도 찾아냈습니다. 이제 차르는 기다립니다. 공격해 그의 신성한 생득권인 전 러시아를 되찾을 순간을 기다립니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC:0 "서러시아의 마지막 군주 보리스 1세의 이야기는 기이하지만 대단히 흥미롭습니다. 보리스 미하일로비치 스코시레프는 당시 러시아 제국 땅이었던 빌나의 부유한 가문에서 태어났습니다. 보리스는 상류 계급 가문의 일원이었지만 태어날때는 어떤 직위의 권리주장자도 아니었습니다. 그렇지만 혈통이 가져다 줄 수 없는 것을 스스로 얻어냈습니다.\n\n10월 혁명이 발발했을 때, 보리스는 도망쳐 수많은 망명자 중 하나가 되었습니다. 곧 영국 외무부에서 이름을 날렸고 수많은 임무에 참가했습니다. 그 뒤에는 네덜란드에, 그리고 지금까지 밝혀진 그의 모험 중 제일 유명한 일이 벌어진 곳 - 안도라에 발을 디뎠습니다. 조심스럽게 음모를 꾸민 보리스는 1930년대에 대중의 지지를 통해 대공 직위를 빼앗았으며 안도라를 현대 국가로 만들겠다고 약속했습니다. 얼마 못가 체포 및 수감되었지만 서유럽 감옥에서 몇 년을 보낸 후, 운 좋게 나치 점령 당국에게 풀려나 이들과 협조했습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 일어나고 차르 블라디미르가 원정을 떠날 때, 보리스는 기꺼이 합류해 충성스러운 연락책으로서 블라디미르와 함께했습니다. 그 위치가 불편해지기 전까지는 말입니다.\n\n반공경비대가 승리를 거듭할 때 스코시레프는 가만히 있지 않았습니다. 어느날, 반공경비대가 뱟카에 접근하자 보리스는 도시 중심부로 가서 총질을 한 다음, 과거의 서러시아 당국은 끝났으며 키르피흐니코프의 군대가 이를 대체한다고 선언했습니다. 이제 뱟카 대공이자 변방 지대의 수호자인 보리스 1세는 반공경비대와 러시아 국민의 이름으로 도시의 부패한 지도자들을 대신해 이 땅을 다스립니다. 이 공국이 얼마나 오래갈지 누가 알겠습니까."

 ### Ideas ###
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction:0 "Unrepentant Reaction"
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the old empire Russia has suffered, crushed beneath one tyrant after another. Communism, and its cloaked agent socialism, have worked tirelessly to take away what little the Russian people have left, and to this the Tsar has proclaimed 'No more!' The Empire will rise again, the communists will be destroyed, and with the Tsar's just rule, peace will again return to this great land."

 KIR_officer_infighting:0 "Military Infighting"
 KIR_officer_infighting_desc:0 "The White Army, or what remains of it, has never been a unified front. Though a shared hatred of communism unites them, the question of how a unified Russia should be governed threatens to shatter the unity of the Tsar's armies. While some believe in the old ideals, others petition for democracy, and a few even speak of the strengths of fascistic regimes. The Tsar alone is the only thing keeping them in line, and even then only just. It is clear that if the state is to rebuild what was once lost, it must ensure that the army stands united."

 KIR_officers_reigned_in:0 "Officers Reined in"
 KIR_officers_reigned_in_desc:0 "Though difficult, the state has succeeded in curbing both the worst influences of, and actions taken by, its military officer corps. Though it will take time, political influence, and cause manpower disruptions as problematic officers are cashiered or prosecuted, the Tsar can be confident that his officers will soon be united in purpose. Divided leadership will no longer negatively affect our armies."

 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself:0 "The Tsar and Himself"
 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself_desc:0 "Like in the old days, the Tsar rules with absolute power. Lately, however, he has witnessed the rise of liberalism and democratic ideals within the hearts and minds of his subjects. Though many advise him to ignore these developments altogether, the Tsar knows well that he stands on a precipice, where the love of his people could very quickly turn into hatred, the way it has before. He must, therefore, soon make a choice: To rule alone, as his ancestors did, or to give the people their own say in his government."

 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea:0 "The People's Emperor"
 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea_desc:0 "In keeping with his effort to demonstrate solidarity with every one of his many subjects, the Tsar has embarked on a whirlwind tour of the many factories and industrial facilities in the state, meeting with workers and acting to solve the problems that most affect them. Though none can find fault with the political benefit of doing so, and while the Tsar's personal attention will no doubt result in factories doing their best to demonstrate elevated production levels, it is likely that efficiency will be hampered as the declared 'solutions' are suddenly implemented."

 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea:0 "Imperial Detachment"
 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea_desc:0 "The Tsar's decision to preserve that intangible aspect of character critical to his role as a monarch, as well as to focus on matters of state rather than matters of publicity, has resulted in his personal withdrawal from many events, even as his person remains in the minds of all those present. While this is no doubt reassuring to many, who can be secure in the knowledge that their Tsar is fixing problems before they become apparent to society at large, making his position known to the public through functionaries does require additional efforts to be made."

 KIR_kirov_vodka:0 "Vyatka Vodka"
 KIR_kirov_vodka_desc:0 "The Vyatka distilleries are in full operation, producing enormous quantities of high-quality spirits that can be consumed at home, exported abroad, or used in medical and military settings as a high-quality antiseptic. Although it might seem humorous to some, vodka is a Russian staple, and with thoughts of an united motherland accompanying every bottle consumed, all are inspired to work harder and waste less in pursuit of the dream of unification."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana:0 "A Modern Age Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_desc:0 "The Tsar has wisely reconstituted the Okhrana, the Imperial intelligence and counter-revolutionary police force. With resources so dedicated, and with the knowledge that they shield the state from enemies both foreign and domestic, they will act to improve the state's cryptographic capabilities as well as minimize the operations of bandit and partisan strikes on its forces. In addition, and through the sharing of obtained information, they will also serve to better the tactical dispositions of military commanders in the field."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2:0 "A Shackled Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2_desc:0 "Although critical to national security, the Okhrana cannot be permitted to operate without oversight. As a result, a supervisory body has been established to prevent excesses. Though this naturally reduces its effectiveness, it is a small price to pay to ensure that overzealous actions do not threaten political stability."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3:0 "A Strengthened Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3_desc:0 "Without the constant vigilance of the Okhrana, the Tsar's government would have long ago fallen to revolutionaries, traitors, or worse. It must therefore be given wide latitude to intercept and eliminate potential threats before they become real ones. Though it is likely that some 'mistakes' will be made, it is a small price to pay to ensure the security of the state."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet:0 "A Shackled Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet_desc:0 "Although critical to national security, the Okhrana cannot be permitted to operate without oversight. As a result, a supervisory body has been established to prevent excesses. Though this naturally reduces its effectiveness, it is a small price to pay to ensure that overzealous actions do not threaten political stability."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea:0 "White Army Traditions"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_desc:0 "By directly connecting the traditions of the army to that of the old, uncorrupted Imperial state, the Tsar has encouraged the formation of a true modern army with Russian sensibilities. Disciplined, proud, meritocratic, and well-organized, it is far superior to the 'armies' of the many Russian statelets, and will proudly carry the banner through both European Russia and on the long journey to the Far East."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2:0 "White Army Traditions"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2_desc:0 "By directly connecting the traditions of the army to that of the old, uncorrupted Imperial state, the Tsar has encouraged the formation of a true modern army with Russian sensibilities.

 KIR_imperial_special_forces:0 "Imperial Special Forces"
 KIR_imperial_special_forces_desc:0 "As part of the state's reorientation away from tradition and towards modern approaches to warfare, an increased focus has been placed on the selection and training of specialist formations. While this focus certainly increases the efficacy of these special units, the stringent requirements for induction within them has resulted, at least temporarily, in an overall reduction of recruitment efforts."

 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea:0 "Strength in Numbers"
 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea_desc:0 "Holding true to the classical Russian focus on manpower and numerical superiority, the state's military has vastly expanded recruitment, relaxing standards and searching for recruits outside traditional areas. While this does mean many more soldiers will be entering the Tsar's armies, it also means that they are, at least for a time, likely to be somewhat less effective as training programs are stretched beyond their natural limits."

 KIR_general_staff_academy:0 "The Vyatka General Staff Academy"
 KIR_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "The establishment of a unified, and universal, training curriculum for the state's military officers has, as expected, resulted in an overall increase in military capability. Properly trained officers, operating from common ground, have proven their skills in everything from administrative organization to entrenchment to the identification of future leadership candidates. Confidence is growing."

Properly trained officers, operating from common ground, have proven their skills in everything from administrative organization to entrenchment to the identification of future leadership candidates. Confidence is growing."

 KIR_fortified_position:0 "Fortified Position"
 KIR_fortified_position_desc:0 "The state has moved to consolidate its territory following recent gains. As a result, military formations have been oriented towards defensive purposes while supply lines are strengthened, partisans and bandits eliminated, and future priorities identified."

 KIR_archives_of_samara:0 "Archives of Samara"
 KIR_archives_of_samara_desc:0 "Samara served as an evacuation point for Soviet state records during their collapse in the Second World War. With the state's capture of the city and careful examination of said archives, valuable insights into the personalities and responses of the West Russian Revolutionary Front (WRRF) have been obtained, assisting in future combat against them."

 KIR_the_bridgeburners:0 "The Bridgeburners"
 KIR_the_bridgeburners_desc:0 "The Special Imperial Operations Unit, better known as the 'Bridgeburners,' is a specialized force composed of both military and Okhrana personnel tasked with direct-action operations behind enemy lines. Attacking convoys, assassinating lone officers and, yes, destroying bridges, their activities will hamper the defensive capabilities of the state's enemies, even before its soldiers arrive to engage them."

 KIR_solidarist_constitution:0 "The Imperial Constitution"
 KIR_solidarist_constitution_desc:0 "The state has successfully drafted the first Imperial Constitution of the revived Russian Empire. Whatever its particulars, this is an enormous accomplishment, demonstrating the return of political stability to Russia - under the Tsar and the Romanov dynasty!"

 KIR_solidarist_economy:0 "A Planned Economy"
 KIR_solidarist_economy_desc:0 "Applying their policies of corporatism to the plans of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the Solidarists have enshrined the input of interest groups and concentrated economic sectors within industrial planning. This has a corresponding benefit on efficiency, as the common motivation to reduce waste is focused upon."

 KIR_unionist_economy:0 "Austerity Measures"
 KIR_unionist_economy_desc:0 "Continuing previous policies of austerity, only now under the supervision of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the National Union has continued to restrict government spending in nearly all social sectors. Though politically challenging, this has allowed for an increasing proportion of industry to be oriented towards military purposes."

 KIR_kadet_economy:0 "A Liberal Economy"
 KIR_kadet_economy_desc:0 "Applying their policies of liberalization to the plans of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the Kadets have ended previous programs of austerity while also introducing free market reforms. Though considered radical by some, these changes have encouraged significant economic expansion, already observed in a corresponding increase in production levels."

 KIR_kadet_economy_2:0 "A Liberal Economy"

 KIR_reopened_universities:0 "Reopened Universities"
 KIR_reopened_universities_desc:0 "Universities, long since closed down in the chaos of Western Russia, have again re-opened thanks to the Tsar's efforts. With eager students already applying for admission, the future of Russian education has been secured."

 KIR_revitalizing_the_russian_spirit:0 "Revitalizing the Russian Spirit"
 KIR_revitalizing_the_russian_spirit_desc:0 "Efforts by the National Union to remind the people of the spirit of Imperial trust that once pervaded the Empire have been successful. Already the state is observing an increase in self-sacrifice, dedication to hard work, and trust in the Tsar's government that has not been seen for decades."

 KIR_tsars_golden_purse_idea:0 "The Tsar's Golden Purse"
 KIR_tsars_golden_purse_idea_desc:0 "Personal investments, by the Tsar himself, in state industrial endeavors has had significant impact. Financed improvements have led to a direct and observable increase in economic efficiency and raw industral output. Though this cannot last forever, it is an exceptional boon for the near future."

 KIR_decommunization:0 "Decommunization"
 KIR_decommunization_desc:0 "In an effort to purge the nation of commnunist-based revolutionary elements, the state has begun an official program of communication. Literature, monuments, and anything else associated with previous communist regimes are being destroyed, and former communist officials are being investigated to determine the suitability of amnesties - following public repudiation, of course."

 KIR_ural_reconstruction_program:0 "Ural Reconstruction Program"
 KIR_ural_reconstruction_program_desc:0 "Following the conquest of the regions surrounding the Ural Mountains, the state has begun a program of rapid reconstruction using military-based formations in order to ensure that industry within the region is normalized to the rest of the nation. While a significant investment, it is likely to have positive effects both on industrial efficiency as well as the security of formations as long as it is active."

 KIR_return_of_the_tsar:0 "Return of the Emperor"
 KIR_return_of_the_tsar_desc:0 "The emergence of Vyatka, a monarchist state, in a land that had executed its previous monarchs was one of the stranger outcomes of the West Russian War. And yet, to many, it was understandable.\n\nCommunism had utterly failed the Russian people, leading them into subjugation under a foreign regime, and a return to earlier times, when Russia imposed its will on others, rather than being imposed upon itself, was inherently attractive.\n\nTsar Vladimir has shown to the people the qualities expected of an Emperor, sharing in their pain from and anger at the German bombers that terrorize them regularly. And he has pledged that, in due time, he will see their skies cleared, their land reclaimed, and their Imperial eagle proudly displayed from the Volga to the Amur."

 KIR_an_economic_graveyard:0 "An Economic Graveyard"
 KIR_an_economic_graveyard_desc:0 "Across all of Western Russia, regular bombing missions by the German Luftwaffe make it impossible to maintain an economy of any reasonable size of complexity. Anything resembling a factory is identified, targetted, and destroyed. This is by design. The Germans know that if they can keep us from industrializing they can keep us from unifying against them.\n\nWe may not be able to build an industrial base at the moment, but that does not mean we must remain idle. We can evaluate our resources, identify skilled workers, and plan future development sites. We can prepare as much as we are able. If we are to reclaim Russia for the Romanov dynasty, we must have industry.\n\nOne day, the bombings will, must, stop. And when they do, we will be ready."

 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery:0 "The Vyatka Distillery"
 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery_desc:0 "To many Russians, a stable supply of good-quality vodka is considered as essential as food itself. As a result of devastation from both the war and the German bombing campaigns, such a product has become scarce. And therein lies an opportunity that the Tsar has proposed to exploit.\n\nPotatoes will be planted and farmed in bulk, providing food, employment, and raw materials for the spirit. Distilleries will be reclaimed and reconstituted to transform those materials into high-quality vodka, proving yet more employment, addressing domestic demand, and supplying the state with a valuable - and highly desired - trade good.\n\nThe revenue from selling vodka all over Russia will finance other projects, and with every bottle sold, one more Russian will know that their Tsar understands their needs."

 KIR_alternative_uses:0 "Alternative Uses"
 KIR_alternative_uses_desc:0 "The high-quality alcohol produced by state distilleries, though eminently valuable for trade, can also be used as an effective antiseptic. In Russia, where injury is a fact of life and medical infrastructure is frequently fragile, this is valuable almost beyond compare.\n\nBy constructing laboratories adjacent to our new distilleries, we can render some of the produced spirits into medical-grade disinfectant, and supply both our civilian and military hospitals with a reliable and steady supply. We can, in a similar fashion, also package some of it for export, increasing trade, generating capital and, perhaps, civilizing warfare in Russia ever so slightly."

 KIR_the_imperial_potato_act:0 "The Imperial Potato Act"
 KIR_the_imperial_potato_act_desc:0 "The success of the Tsar's initiative to develop a distillation industry has been successful. Too successful. While employment has risen and much needed hard currency, earned from export, has begun to enter the economy at long last, we have a serious problem. There are simply not enough potatoes to keep up with demand. We must take action.\n\nThe solution is the Imperial Potato Act, providing increasing subsidies in taxes, land, and labor for farmers who agree to dedicate certain percentages of their arable land to potatoes.\n\nThe increased production will allow for more vodka to be bottled, which will also allow us to begin increasing the amount of it we export. It won't be long until the Bretons, French, Germans, and more all agree that the finest Russian vodka comes from Vyatka."

 KIR_find_new_markets:0 "Find New Markets"
 KIR_find_new_markets_desc:0 "Optimizations made to the Vyatka distilleries in recent times have resulted in even greater production than before. We simply cannot sell it all, on either the domestic or local foreign markets, without an unacceptable reduction in price. The solution, therefore, must lie further afield.\n\nBrittany, the Tsar's former home, has in recent years embraced an identity as a nexus of legal and extralegal trade, and this offers an opportunity. Although sales likely won't reach the same levels as in Russia, they will act to reduce our vast stockpiles, protect our prices, and bring in hard currency besides."

 KIR_rolling_on_the_river:0 "Rolling on the River"
 KIR_rolling_on_the_river_desc:0 "River transport has long been a mainstay of Russian commerce and trade. Transport along them is often much faster than moving overland, and this is doubly so in current times, given the state of Russian infrastructure. Though we no longer control great rivers such as the Dnieper, the Don, or the Volga, we do control the Vyatka River, and it connects into a vast network of other rivers across Western Russia.\n\nBy re-opening the city's wharves and promoting the construction of river barges and other tradecraft, we can compensate for our infrastructure and increase trade both internally and externally. Perhaps, in time, Vyatka itself will become a hub for such activity."

 KIR_the_kostroma_pipeline:0 "The Kostroma Pipeline"
 KIR_the_kostroma_pipeline_desc:0 "The establishment of trade connections with the Bretons has proven very beneficial, allowing us an outlet for our excess production of both alcohol as well as other goods. But Brittany is far away, and transporting good there is in itself a risk. We need somewhere closer.\n\nKostroma, as a free city situated on the border of the German sphere, is perfectly situated. The porous border allows for the easy transport of goods into the Reich, and while the Germans are not our friends any longer, their money is just as good as anyone else's. We will take it. Until the empire is strong enough not to need to."

 KIR_a_new_hub_of_trade:0 "A New Hub of Trade"
 KIR_a_new_hub_of_trade_desc:0 "Our efforts to encourage trade have proven wildly successful . With the identification and prioritization of key trade goods, the development of international connections, and the promotion of rapid and efficient arteries of trade among the Russian waterways, Vyatka has exploded in activity. The city's wharves are bustling, merchants are moving ever larger carhoes, and revenue increases month-over-month. However, the Tsar and those who advise him are always looking forward.\n\nA plan to establish Vyatka as a central trade hub for Western Russia has been put forward and accepted. Infrastructure will be vastly expanded, allowing for consequent expansions in trade and other forms of commerce and ensuring a dominating future position for Vyatka as a city, and contributing to a strong financial base for campaigns to come."

 KIR_imperial_austerity:0 "Imperial Austerity"
 KIR_imperial_austerity_desc:0 "Following an exhaustive audit of the Principality's economy in its entirety, both the Tsar and his ministers have been shocked to learn of its true, highly decrepit, state. Factories lie abandoned, as artisans produce what little they can in basement workshops. Fields lie fallow, as farmers focus on subsistence farming to feed themselves and their families. If action is not taken, our fragile economy will soon collapse entirely.\n\nTo address this, a plan for austerity has been put before the Tsar. Severe cuts to services, education, and security will be painful, especially for the many already suffering. But they are necessary. And the Tsar has been very clear - they will not last forever."

 KIR_moderate_austerity_programs:0 "Moderate Austerity Programs"
 KIR_moderate_austerity_programs_desc:0 "The Tsar and his government are in agreement that a program of austerity is necessary in order to prevent economic collapse. But consideration must also be given to the effect it will have on our people, who have already endured years of suffering. A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has chosen to moderate the proposal. Cuts will be made, some quite painful, but they will be compassionate. The Tsar will not impose undue burden on his people, and sectors that are identified as critical to the basic needs of the population will be spared the worst of the reductions. A Russia without its people is no Russia at all."

 KIR_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 KIR_public_works_projects_desc:0 "Two horrific wars, a breakdown of central authority, and the regular German bombing of anything of value has resulted in the almost complete destruction of any Russian infrastructure worthy of the name. In both our state and elsewhere, ordinary Russians rely on local paths and trail guides for most travel. That naturally strangles trade, industrial and economic development, and military operations. It must be addressed.\n\nTo solve this, The Tsar and his government will fund public works projects throughout the Principality, building new infrastructure and repairing the old while also providing employment. The Germans will destroy some of it, of course, but we will maintain commitment, whatever the cost. The future demands it."

 KIR_imperial_bank_of_russia:0 "Imperial Bank of Russia"
 KIR_imperial_bank_of_russia_desc:0 "The breakdown of Russia's industrial economy was accompanied by the breakdown of any reliable system of banking. The result has been the near-complete absence of appreciable investment or credit, lack of confidence in currencies, a return to the hoarding of precious metals, and the development of a barter-based economy amongst citizens.\n\nWith the establishment of public works and austerity programs, the next step is to rectify this critical issue through the creation of a central bank. Such a creation will help to legitimize, promote trust in, and set policy for our currency. Further, it will allow for both the stimulation and regulation of commercial and private lenders, encouraging economic growth in all sectors."

 KIR_more_extreme_measures:0 "More Extreme Measures"
 KIR_more_extreme_measures_desc:0 "The Tsar and his government are in agreement that a program of austerity is necessary in order to prevent economic collapse. But consideration must also be given to the effect it will have on our people, who have already endured years of suffering. A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has made that hard choice. Infrastructure, healthcare, social programs, and more will be cut to the bone in order to establish the state's financial security and provide a basis for our future designs of territorial reclamation. The people will not be happy, but in time they will learn that the Tsar is planning for their future just as much as his own."

 KIR_divert_funds_to_the_military:0 "Divert Funds to the Military"
 KIR_divert_funds_to_the_military_desc:0 "Though painful, our severe cuts to the state budget have resulted in a surplus of assignable funds. Dedicating them to the military is an obvious choice - without secure control of our lands we cannot accomplish anything of note. Additional resources will allow them to recruit more soldiers, acquire more equipment, and improve their readiness.\n\nWe do, however, expect a negative response from the public, given what they have had to surrender in order to make this military expansion a possibility. Nevertheless, we are committed - regardless of the unpopularity of this action, we are preparing for the future of all of Russia, and in time the public will understand."

 KIR_tax_the_commoners:0 "Increase Taxes"
 KIR_tax_the_commoners_desc:0 "Despite our harsh austerity measures, we have not reduced expenditures to a sufficient degree. Revenue must therefore increase, and the only appreciable way to do that is through significant increases in taxation. Levies on a wide basket of basic and consumer goods should be sufficient, and though it will cause further public discontent, there is currently no other choice available.\n\nIt is, however, believed that this measure should be the last required in order to obtain the funds needed for significant public investments, which would then permit the relaxation of austerity programs. We will show our citizens that their anger has been misplaced. But they must endure for a little while longer."

 KIR_start_of_the_recovery:0 "Start of the Recovery"
 KIR_start_of_the_recovery_desc:0 "The light can finally be seen. Although painful, the austerity measures we imposed managed to prevent total collapse, and the strategic investments made are finally beginning to have an effect. Economic activity has sharply increased, and new workshops and industries have begun to appear organically.\n\nWe must remain vigilant, however, expanding previously reduced programs as revenues rise and instituting reforms as needed. The road ahead to complete unification under the Tsar is and will be a long one, but we have done what we can to give ourselves, and our people, the best start possible."

They seized the great wealth of her learned classes. They murdered her rulers as if they were ordinary criminals. And then they failed, twice, at protecting her from rapacious invaders.\n\nAlthough the scars of their crimes remain, there is still hope. Tsar Vladimir, proud scion of the Romanovs, has returned. It is his divine right to rule Russia and its people, and when opportunity presents itself, he will crush the bandits, fascists, communists, and fanatics that have conspired to tear Russia apart.\n\nThe Third Rome will rise again."

 KIR_a_tangled_web:0 "A Tangled Web"
 KIR_a_tangled_web_desc:0 "The fall of the old empire was accelerated by poor administrative capability, which then allowed for both economic malaise and communist extremism to spread. Apart from the Tsar himself, we are seeing this in the Principality, with many of the 'temporary' government organs established years ago still in operation. We must learn from the past, and not allow it to be repeated.\n\nConsequently, we will act decisively to untangle this web, clearing out redundant offices, formalizing needed governmental services, and dispatching with wasteful excess. In such a way, we will strengthen our control over both our current, and future, territory."

 KIR_the_great_game:0 "The Great Game"
 KIR_the_great_game_desc:0 "Influence peddling is a component of any government, and the Tsar's administration is no exception. On a daily basis deals are made and broken, favours are traded, and information is exchanged amongst the many functionaries of our state.\n\nBut there is a limit, and the degree of these exchanges have, recently, threatened to divide the government to an unacceptable degree. The Tsar is not blind to this, and he knows that such efforts distract from any eventual efforts to reunify the nation. But he also knows that to act to reduce it could engender the opposite effect. Prudence is required.\n\nHe will therefore demonstrate his public displeasure with such actions, weakening the positions of those engaging in them without provoking conflict. But he will not forget, and when the state is more secure there will be a reckoning."

 KIR_fifty_shades_of_monarchism:0 "The Many Shades of Monarchism"
 KIR_fifty_shades_of_monarchism_desc:0 "Monarchism is not in itself an ideology, and as such it tends to attract a coalition of those of many different political persuasions. Our Principality is no different. While all agree that Tsar Vladimir is the rightful ruler of all of Russia, they disagree on how his rule should be expressed.\n\nAbsolutists believe he should be unrestricted while constitutionalists believe there should be checks on his authority. Fascists, socialists, and others also routinely present their own views. All of these forms of monarchy, and a great deal more, are regularly advocated for. But none can say which will, eventually, emerge to dominate the others."

 KIR_utilize_the_okhrana_desc:0 "Despite the Tsar's righteous rule, there are those who would see him shackled, deposed, or worse. Every society has its dissidents, and they must be watched. The Okhrana - the Tsar's secret police - was created to monitor and curtail the actions of those who wished the destruction of Russia. Though they failed in their mission, the lessons learned through that failure have not been forgotten.\n\nTo combat these dissidents, the Okhrana will be recreated, and the issues that led to their previous failure will be corrected. Once again they will watch over and guard our Tsar, our state, and our way of life. In so doing ensure the stability of our Principality and, one day, our Empire."

 KIR_form_the_imperial_council_desc:0 "Even a man as dedicated and righteous as Tsar Vladimir cannot rule alone. Loyal retainers are needed, both as territorial administrators and as advisors on matters of state. As such, an Imperial Council will be established, allowing for the collection and application of the finest minds of the Principality to critical matters.\n\nThose so identified will include eminent figures in arts and sciences, experienced government functionaries, skilled military officers, and more. Their learned counsel will inform the Tsar about anything to which he is not aware, and should he be incapacitated for whatever reason, they can be trusted to maintain a regency until such time as the Tsar's duties can be resumed."

He understands the needs of the common man, and knows well that, but for the chance of divinity, he would be amongst them in the fields, the factory, or the social club. No longer will he remain in his palace. He will travel far and wide, he will speak directly to petitioners, and he will demonstrate his love for the country and the people firsthand.\n\nBy doing so, he will inherently disprove the propaganda of our enemies, who claim him a distant, tyrannical, and uncaring despot. And he will bind our people together, leading them towards the future, and securing peace and prosperity for all Russians - great and small alike."

He is a man who can be trusted to remain above petty rivalries, factionalism, and self-interest, and dispassionately look at an issue from all sides before making the best decision possible. This identity, this image, must be protected.\n\nThe Tsar will remain separate from the people, interacting with them through ministers, functionaries, and officers. In this way he will always be present in their minds, a reassuring presence, every time they see our flag or speak to a representative of the state. This will be how we safeguard Russia against the destruction that once consumed it, and it will be how we guarantee prosperity and peace to our children."

If our goal is to revive Russia in body, we must begin by reviving Russia in spirit, and so re-establish its cultural and intellectual heart.\n\nWe will generate and distribute generous grants to artists, poets, musicians, and intellecutals. We will invite them to our court and grant them citizenship in our lands, and commission vast quantities of artwork, composition, poetry, and more. We will usher in a new generation of Russian culture and, in time, Russia will once again be known as a beacon of culture and the arts, with the Tsar as its greatest patron."

KIR_the_tsars_speech_desc:0 "The Tsar's frequent radio addresses to the Principality are, naturally, a great source of comfort for its citizens, demonstrating to them that their monarch carries them in his thoughts at all times. Following yet another German bombing raid, he has decided to give another.\n\nUnusually, he has taken in active role in its drafting, carefully determining both the content and method of presentation, and word has spread that this address is unlikely to be like all the others. From all corners of our realm, the Tsar's subjects huddle around radios, improvised or otherwise.\n\nAnd await the words of their sovereign."

 KIR_the_bishop_of_vyatka_desc:0 "Historically, the role of the Orthodox Church in the Russian state was almost as central as that of the monarchy itself. Despite this, the relationship between the Tsar and the Church in recent years has been, if not antagonistic, fairly cold. Many within believe the Tsar insufficiently pious, and this is beginning to affect his perceived legitimacy. A solution must be found, and quickly.\n\nThe diocese of Vyatka is currently vacant, and if a bishop were appointed it would, in addition to publicly confirming the Tsar's dedication to the Church and acting to reaffirm his bond to it, provide valuable moral guidance to our citizens, ever in danger of being led astray."

It emphasized the need for cooperation among all the slavic peoples of Russia for mutual benefit, and with so many of them living under oppression, whether in German lands or otherwise, this need for cooperation could not be more severe.\n\nWe will support this policy, and integrate it into our government's social and economic policies. In this way, we will bind our country closer together, and prepare it for when it can, and will, welcome all of its brothers and sisters back home."

 KIR_our_august_leader_desc:0 "Under the old Empire, the Tsar's will was absolute. This allowed him great power with regards to reshaping Russia, but it also made it trivial for him to abuse his position, raise the enmity of the people, and, eventually, give birth to the cancer that was communism. These memories still persist among some of our citizens, reducing support for the Tsar, and thus for our government.\n\nTo counteract this, we will promote a reimagining of the Tsar's role and position. He must, and will, be seen as the manifestation of the national collective will, and as the staunch defender of the Imperial constitution. It will be made clear that, in stark contrast to the old Empire, the Tsar of the new wields his divine authority for the betterment of the people and of his government, and not for the betterment of himself."

These are Russian, populated by Russians, and crying our for liberation by the true Russians. And we will answer.\n\nWe will make it clear to the 'rulers' of these lands that they will submit to Imperial authority and surrender the temporal control of them to the Tsar's government. In so doing we will bring to these millions of Russians the enlightened governance that they deserve.\n\nAnd if the bandits refuse, they will be dealt with most harshly."

In the modern age, this form of survival is no longer viable.\n\nWe will bring industry to the Urals, and challenge those living there to integrate themselves with it. With characteristic Russian fortitude and hard work, along with some minor assistance for those less able, we will bring these brothers and sisters of ours into the modern Russia."

Political stability is ever increasing. Our industrial base is developing at a rapid pace. Our schools are graduating more scientists, engineers, and doctors.

Berezniki, a frontier territory surrounded by radicals, was eventually pacified by Kazembek and his followers, and despite all likelihoods to the contrary the territory, now a viceroyalty of the Mladorossi, has both survived and thrived.\n\nIndeed, reports from the Tsar's representative, Boris Skosyrev, have described both significant industrial developments as well as the sustainable exploitation of local natural resources. These resources, including critical oil and petroleum products, are regularly dispatched back to the Principality, under the careful political supervision of Kazembek himself. Thus, he is crucial both to maintaining peace in and delivering resources from the region, and as long as he does that, carefully supervised by Skosyrev, he will maintain his position.\n\nDespite this, however, suspicion from members of our government towards Kazembek continues, and many say that his resource deliveries will continue only until he sees an opportunity to fully divorce himself from the Tsar's authority.

Yevgeny was the first to arrive, and it took him only a few moments after proving to the suddenly skittish police officers who he was to understand why he had been called. Arriving later, Valentin understood similarly quickly.\n\nThe existence of a revolutionary cell, dedicated to the overthrow of the Tsar, had recently been discovered. The dead man, an official from the Ministry of Finance, had had his name flagged in connection to it, and having been assigned to the task force looking into the cell, they both knew, immediately, that there had to be a connection. Why this man had been killed, and by who, was still unclear.\n\nBut to do so was an enormous risk on the part of the cell, and there had to have been a reason.

The casing was bagged and would be examined to determine the type and origin of the gun. The next step was to look for evidence that might connect the man to the cell, in order to trove the suspicions of him that had arisen before his death.\n\nThis was similarly found in a box of letters. Amongst the many sent to the man from family and friends, one stood out. Sent by "Kachestvennaya Dostavka," an import/export company that operated throughout Western Russia, it indicated that the man had been involved in moving unspecified cargo for them in and out of the industrial city of Izhevsk.\n\nAnother such letter indicated that he had recently facilitated the purchase of a small warehouse for the company here Vyatka itself, and had specifically ensured that it was in a lesser-traveled part of the city.

Underneath, a ladder descended into a crudely excavated cellar, and inside they found what they had come for.\n\nOn a desk covered in maps and folders, one in particular stood out. Stamped 'Confidential - Plan Eagle,' the papers inside the folder seemed to describe an upcoming sabotage operation against an industrial plant in Izhevsk, using materials shipped from the warehouse they had investigated earlier.

Other Ministry agents were gently interviewed, companies he had worked with were contacted, and offices he had worked in searched, all to no success.\n\nHowever, there remained several specific factories that had been identified in his letters, and which could still be explored.

Running against the crowds of workers, and towards the site of the explosion, Yevgeny spotted a figure standing nearby.

Moving quickly, Yevgeny, Valentin, and the support team followed. As Yevgeny approached the figure, he realized that it was attaching a device to one of the factory's fuel tanks, and drew his sidearm while calling out a challenge.

The man was young, probably not out of his twenties, and clearly very physically fit besides.

Yevgeny realized he had a clear shot and, knowing that it was preferable to eliminate an enemy agent if escape could not be prevented, slowed to better his aim, firing three times a moment later.\n\nOne shot found its mark, striking the saboteur in the shoulder, but before he could fire again the figure, after several stumbling steps, disappeared into shadow. Yevgeny cursed as Valentin stopped beside him, equally angry.\n\nBoth agents knew that they would mobilize the city's officers to try and find the saboteur, and both knew it was unlikely to lead to an arrest. Already the saboteur would be executing an escape plan, and within hours would be deep in the Russian forests, if not in the territory of another power altogether.\n\nYevgeny and Valentin looked at each other, sharing a grimace.

Trying to do so only slowed you down, he would say, and often did little to hinder pursuit. As such, and despite the obvious difference in physicality, he found himself gaining on the saboteur. He realized he had a clear shot, if he had wanted it.\n\nBut he, they, needed the man alive. He was their connection, their next link in the cell's chain. He could not be allowed to get away. And, as they approached an exit to the factory's grounds, Yevgeny saw that he would not. Suddenly appearing in front of him through herculean effort, Valentin barreled into the saboteur, knocking him flat and pinning him onto the ground.\n\nAs Yevgeny rushed forward and pressed his pistol to the saboteur's head, Valentin prepared restraints.

As a an agent of the cell, now known to be comprised of both infiltrators from the Revolutionary Front along with local communist and socialist dissidents, he was able to offer insight into its activities as well as identifying information about his direct contacts.\n\nAs a result of their quick actions in Izhvesk, Yevgeny and Valentin, together with many other loyal agents, were able to, in short order, make a number of additional arrests and work their way further up the chain. Before long, the ability of the cell to conduct operations was crippled, and though several members of it escaped, its ability to act as a serious threat to the Tsar's regime was destroyed.\n\nThus, despite the failure to halt the attack in Izhvesk, the Okhrana saw the overall result as a victory for themselves, for the Tsar, and for the integrity of monarchism as an institution."

Yevgeny and Valentin had acted, using both training and intuition, to rapidly pursue the leads obtained from investigating the deceased official. In so doing, they not only prevented a serious terrorist attack at a critical manufacturing facility, but also captured the would-be saboteur for interrogation.\n\nInterrogation that soon led to the arrests of others, members all of an experienced and dedicated subversive cell. The destruction of which did much to protect the state while simultaneously blinding and blunting the efforts of its enemies.\n\nThe agents themselves were richly, if covertly given the classified nature of the entire operation, rewarded.

This was a system that Yevgeny and Valentin did use, and had used, to great effect in their careers.\n\nSometimes the tasks were simple. Intercepting communications, raiding suspected safe-houses, interrogating denounced dissidents, and the like. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes men had to be found, run to ground, and delivered to their superiors, whatever the collateral damage to the families or friends of their quarry. Almost to a one, those men were never seen again.\n\nYes, the Okhrana valued efficiency, and Yevgeny and Valentin had mastered the art of being so, through training, practice, and long hours of actual work. What else could one call the feat of securing the critical lead in an offensive against a foreign-sponsored insurrectionist cell?\n\nWith every task completed, with every enemy neutralized, Yevgeny and Valentin advanced just that much higher in the Okhrana's hierarchy, their ultimate aim to serve and protect the Tsar, no matter the cost or consequences."

As the candles took the light, and as the sun began to set, shadows began to dance around the room. The two points of light in front of him became blazing towers, calling him to prayer before the eyes of the Lord - and before the day of rest began.\n\n"Blessed are You, Lord our God," he began, drawing his breath deep and closing his eyes, "King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Shabbat candles."\n\nThe Sabbath had begun, but Yakov did not open his eyes.

Much worse.\n\nAs they moved to surround him, he moved to walk away, but for the first time one of them grabbed his shoulder. Tightly. By the time he let go, Yakov was surrounded. And then the insults began, and Yakov grew scared. This time, they not only came faster but were also more screamed than spoken.\n\nOne of the men, a well-known scion of an uptown family that was close to the Tsar, withdrew a strip of bacon from his pocket and offered it to Yakov, only to watch him shake his head in reply.\n\nAnother of the thugs laughed. "Boris," he began, speaking to the scion, "I think the dirty Jew doesn't value your generosity." Before Yakov could speak, could try to deny the man's words, Boris had pulled a club from his belt and swung. As Yakov fell to the ground, clutching his head in pain, the rest of the men withdrew their own clubs and began swinging as well.\n\nWhen they had finished, and begun searching his body for gold, rubles, or other valuables, Yakov was unconscious.

The connection between the young man's father and himself was being spoken about more and more, and Vladimir knew he had to take action, and quickly. When he said as much, the young man's eyes went wide.\n\n"Sire," he began, voice trembling, "I know I have caused you both injury and concern. But I beg you to grant mercy. If not for my sake, then for my father's, who fought with you all the way from Brittany to your palace here." He swung an arm towards the window. "Our family has always been supportive of the crown, and if you grant mercy I pledge that my father, and I after him, will always be indebted to you, regardless of need. Please, majesty, do not let the matter of one Jew undo all that we have done for you."\n\nVladimir considered his words for a long moment. He had to show contrition for the injured man, of course. But Mozhayev's family was influential, and to make enemies of them, after so many years of loyalty, could inspire others to ask if their own long loyalties would be similarly treated so poorly. After a moment, he spoke.\n\n"Fine. I will be merciful. This time. It will not happen again. And now you may leave. We are busy."

For Alexiy and Kirill, it was the only work they had known since their conscription. Tearing down derelict buildings to salvage the material, digging trenches and shoring up whatever defenses they could - anything to fortify Vyatka's borders against the threats that lurked without.\n\n"I don't know," Alexiy said, "Wasn't it a bit... bigger, before?" The young conscript wasn't wrong. The old bunker had seen better days. The underground foundations of the shelter were truly sprawling, a maze of holdfasts fit to house more than a hundred men. It had taken them the better part of a day to clear the rubble from where the roof had caved in. Now the bunker would be home to whatever men could be spared for sentry duty and the roof was a series of logs coated in mud to help keep the rain out.\n\n"It was," Kirill replied. "But it'll have to do. We're not made of concrete." Supplies were always spread thin in the Russian wasteland. One learned to make do with what they had if they wanted to survive. In fort building, that meant using old Soviet installations. If there wasn't concrete available, you looked for solid stones. If the stones weren't stable, wood made up the rest. And when there was nothing left but dirt, trenches were dug and lined with bags full of the very same soil.\n\nTheir current project was a sight better than when they had first arrived. What had started as a pile of shattered concrete and rusted metal lugs was now a half respectable redoubt on Vyatka's northern border. It wouldn't stop a determined assault, but for the purposes of making would-be raiders think twice it was adequate. And adequate would have to do."

He looked at his rifle in confusion. Oh, the bolt. He needed to cycle the bolt. He did. He fired again. A Nazi fell over. They were running away. Had they won?\n\n"CEASE FIRE!" Sergeant Ismaylov screamed. "We are low on ammunition!" Isaak wished to ask the Sergeant how this was possible, but then there was a pop and half of Sergeant Ismaylov's head was missing. Blood. Brains. He threw up. The others were yelling. More were coming? He looked over the top. They were getting closer. How many? He lifted his rifle again. Hands were shaky. Pulled the trigger. One fewer, now. He remembered to cycle the bolt. Squeeze. Click. Nothing. He looked to the others. He needed more bullets. More bullets to kill more Nazis.\n\nThey were all empty. Isaak's ears were still ringing. His comrades looked scared. They had run out of bullets before the Nazis had run out of Nazis. What do we do, they asked. Isaak did not know. He said what came to his mind. "Fix bayonets!" They looked confused. Maybe they didn't hear him. He said it louder. They fixed bayonets. Then they were over the top.

He could not recall once having a full night's sleep since establishing his fledgling empire in Vyatka. There was always some matter or another that required his attention. The Luftwaffe's terror bombings were a threat they could not yet contest, and though the men of the Imperial Army watched the borders it was all too often that they bled for it. That was not even to mention Vyatka's internal issues -- from endless bickering about the monarchy's future role to a shattered economy, the keys of power had to be carefully managed. So it was that in spite of a torturous migraine, the Tsar threw off his covers, dressed, and answered the door.\n\n"Your Majesty," the flustered guardsman said, "I beg your pardon for the interruption, but there is a man outside demanding a personal audience. He refuses to leave, he will not see reason."\n\nVladimir frowned. Such strong willed petitioners were not unheard of, but they usually 'saw reason' at the end of a rifle if they did not relent. Were his own Life Guards afraid of a single persistent agitator? "And why have you not made him leave?" the Tsar asked with poorly concealed annoyance.\n\n"Your Majesty, the man claims he was a member of your cousin's Imperial Guard."\n\nThat gave him pause.

Most quaint of all, the old man was quite talkative, a trait not often sought in guards nor appreciated in the presence of emperors. Since introducing himself he had hardly paused to breathe.\n\nStepan spoke of his pride at being selected for Tsar Nicholas II's Imperial Guard. He spoke of his disgust as hundreds of his compatriots abandoned their monarch in the face of revolution. He spoke of his relief that he might fight for the Tsar again in the White Army, then of his sorrow at their bitter defeat. He spoke of his refusal to serve the Union and his time as an émigré in France. He spoke of his return to Russia when France fell. He spoke of long years spent in a motherland that no longer felt like his own, watching it be torn apart first by oppression and second by invasion. He spoke of the thousands of men and women he saw die for a regime that did not value them. He spoke of war and slaughter and collapse, of a shattered Russia in need of hope. He spoke of trying to join the monarchists in the West Russian War only to be captured by Soviets before he could. He spoke of imprisonment and hard labor and torture.

It was laughable to call it a palace, an honorific that Vladimir had refused to bestow upon his current seat of power. But it was his, every splintered stairwell and every faded portrait.

In the weeks since his induction he had proven more than capable of performing duties that men half his age complained about. Vladimir considered his question.

So it was that the Tsar and his entourage journeyed to visit the men that guarded the Empire from unspeakable horror.\n\nVladimir's advisors had protested his choice to visit the front. It was dangerous, they warned. They had protested even more at his choice of escort for the event. They did not think Stepan Novikov was fit to protect him. There were many younger and stronger men that would gladly give their lives for him. But Vladimir did not need the vigor of youth at the border. He needed a watchful eye and a careful ear. Stepan had both.\n\nThe outpost was ready for his arrival. Vyatka's flag flew proudly outside the barracks, and at its foot two score soldiers stood at attention -- the noble defenders that had repelled an Aryan raid only two days earlier. The Tsar walked past them one by one, offering a warm smile or a firm hand on the shoulder. It was a solemn affair nonetheless. He did not doubt that each man there had lost a friend to the front. As he continued down the line he saw a soldier reaching into his pocket. A gift?\n\nThen Vladimir was on the ground. A series of pops. Screaming. He tried to stand. Blood. So much blood. His own?

Soldiers lined the roads, guarding the carriage-led procession on its journey to the Imperial Residence.\n\nVladimir knew he was expected to speak at the end of the procession. But all he could think about were the moments that should have been his last. The pops. The screaming. The blood. Stepan's blood. A noble man that had searched over four decades to serve the rightful Tsar. A brave man that had died only months after he found what he was looking for. What could be said about him that would do justice to such a soul? What could be said that was not already clear by his deeds? In the brief time Vladimir had known Stepan Novikov, there was one immutable tenet that guided him -- service. Service to his Tsar, to his Motherland, to its people. He gave his all to what he believed in.\n\nAs the funeral procession drew closer, Vladimir walked to the edge of his balcony. He saw the rain beating down on buildings with leaky roofs and walls without enough insulation. He saw hundreds of soldiers marching in jackets that were too thin with rifles that were too old.

Vytaka was out in the open and easy to attack. Bandits had not tried to attack the city due to their disorganization and the defenses of the city, but Vytaka did not plan on going against bandits. No, the Tsar wished to go to war with his enemies in the name of restoring his hold over all of Russia. That meant that the city would go under martial law, and the army would protect the city against any foe.

If we can extract concessions and protections from the Tsar, even as we agree to rejoin his state, we can continue to spread our beliefs in peace and security.\n\nMany senior figures in the movement have expressed support for the talks, and the only thing remaining is to see if Kazembek, whose voice carries more weight than all others combined, agrees as well."

Gunshots in battle were rapid and infrequent. Gunshots applied in execution were slow and regular. These were the latter.\n\nSyktyvkar was supposed to have been pacified weeks ago, after orders had come from the government to leave responsibility for the city, apart from the area immediately around Mikhail's military garrison, to local collaborators in the so-called 'Royalist Guard of Syktyvkar.' But still the gunshots continued. Gathering a small party of soldiers, he moved towards the sounds, and as he grew closer his heart began to sink. The gunshots were being joined by screams.\n\nAs he finally reached the origin of the noise, he knew immediately what it was - a cleansing. A party of the Royalist Guard had rounded up a group of citizens and, after short 'interrogations,' executing them.\n\nStorming forward, he demanded a stop to the shootings, and further demanded to know what was going on. The commander just smiled and showed him a pass signed by the city's military governor. The captives were socialists, he said, members and saboteurs of the Revolutionary Front, and he was simply taking care of them.\n\nMikhail could see he had no power here. Were the captives truly socialists? Truly saboteurs? Or were they simply political enemies from the old Republic? Or personal enemies? An order to return to base came over his radio, and with one last look at the terrified captives, he obeyed.\n\nMikhail had once thought that using collaborators meant there would be less bloodshed.

It was being suggested by some that, owing both to their competence and their absolute opposition to communism, they could potentially be recruited into the Imperial Army. The Tsar knew that there were personal reasons for the suggestion as well - after all, many of the captured officers had once served alongside his own during the West Russian War - but there was genuine merit. Many of the generals were truly very skilled.\n\nThe suggestion was fiercely protested by other generals. Unlike both they and the Tsar himself, the men had not abandoned collaboration with the Germans until forced to do so, and they had generally fascist leanings besides. Vladimir faced a dilemma. Would he ignore the past of the ROA generals in the interests of pragmatism? Or would he conclude the cost was not worth the reward?\n\nHe had to decide."

The man was a very capable politician and administrator. And in the government he could both preach Mladorossi-influenced solutions to national problems and also identify sympathetic politicians and officials.\n\nMany officials are, unsurprisingly, critical of the suggestion to give a senior government position to one that they see as both a radical and a traitor, while others see it as a necessary concession towards the state's unification plans for Western Russia. Kazembek is no fool, and if this concession is granted prior to the Tsar's meeting with him, he will not accept a cabinet post without significant influence.\n\nThus, the central question has become whether we will accept the leader of the Mladorossi as an influential figure of our government in exchange for a decisive end to the crisis surrounding his rogue governorate."

The evidence against them, from witnesses and otherwise, was damning, and was supported to great effect using documents, carefully organized and reviewed by the Okhrana, from the archives in Samara.\n\nSeveral of the revolutionaries, long used to bombastic speeches, spoke for hours at length about their own accomplishments, the Tsar's failings, the lack of authority of the court, and many other things besides. But the outcome was never in doubt. It could not be.\n\nAs the sentences were read out, the revolutionaries looked on, stone-faced. They had sent thousands to their deaths after similar trials, and they knew what was coming. Death, for most. Lifetime imprisonment, for some. Long sentences, for a few, to allay allegations of forced harshness. They had spent their life in opposition to the concept of the Imperial state, and now it was finally punishing them.\n\nAll over Russia, both inside the Tsar's domain and without anti-communists rejoiced.

It was thus the perfect unit for him to visit.\n\nEscorted by both bodyguards and senior officers, Vladimir arrived at the battalion's camp in the early afternoon, beginning with a tour of its fortifications and general construction. Following that, he took the time to meet with the soldiers nominated for awards, and taking over responsibility from the unit commander, personally conveyed the awards to those so nominated, with pictures taken all the while.\n\nBy the time he left, later that evening, many of the battalions soldiers seemed more confident, more focused, and more determined to complete their mission.\n\nThe visit was considered a great success, not only among the troops themselves, but also in how the public began to see their Tsar - as a man willing to leave his palace and meet those actually fighting for him, in stark contrast to many of the Romanovs of old."

The syncretic ideology of monarchism and socialism that its rogue governor, Alexander Kazembek, professed was anathema to the military, and nearly to a man they advised their Tsar to give the order to prepare and execute an invasion.\n\nOther, more moderate members of government believed that those same monarchist beliefs of Kazembek could be appealed to in order to negotiate peaceful re-acquisition of the territory.

He wished he could spend more time in this beautiful city.\n\nBut, he reminded himself, he was not here for a vacation. He was here for his people. He was here to obtain both diplomatic recognition and economic opportunity. But progress had been slow, and he was frustrated, no matter how much his advisors reminded him that such was normal when it came to diplomacy. And so his mind wandered towards reflecting on the beauty of Rome.\n\nOne day, he promised himself, Russia would have buildings, cities, like this. Would it have already been possible, had not the communists, and then the Germans, not destroyed everything in their path? If his family had kept their throne?\n\nHe pressed those thoughts aside, and instead pictured a Vyatka dominated by skyscrapers. He liked that thought."

As they did, Skosyrev could tell that Serrano was distant, and he thought he knew why.\n\n"Francisco," he began, "I want this mission to be successful, and so I think I we should address history."

And, you know, if you could help smooth over any lingering feelings from others, I would be most appreciative..."\n\nSerrano's eyes left the road for a moment as he quickly inspected the thickly-wrapped roll of money that Skosyrev had removed from his pocket. "Are you trying to bribe me, Skosyrev?" he chuckled. "Nobody remembers Andorra - I just haven't driven in some time. And if that was your intention, you should have thought harder on it. Russian money doesn't have a very favorable exchange rate." Skosyrev looked down at the bills in disbelief. Rubles!

Works from the minds of such great painters as Ivan Shishkin and Valentin Serov, masterpieces of Issac Levitan, and a scant few pieces of the great Wassily Kandinsky. The guests were enthralled by the works around them, some of the oldest among them remembered the grand exhibitions of the old Imperial court that this event tried to replicate. The air was heavy with the nostalgia for the old days, when the Russian Empire stood tall and its people did not bend to foreign invaders. The mood was one of longing, for the best of the old times, and yet under it all there was a current of hope. As the many nobles of the new Empire passed by the art of their forebears, as the longing passed from their hearts, they were filled with a strange resolve. The Russia of their grandfathers had not died, though the enemies of Russia had tried their best to kill it, it was merely asleep in the hearts of its people.\n\nAs Viktoria mingled with the myriad nobility, she drifted to the centerpiece of the exhibition. The final piece that had been saved from Perm, as Vagner's cult burned away the masterpieces of Russia's past. By far the oldest piece on display, and guarded by a brother of the Order of St. George, the icon of Christ the Redeemer. In the hearts of everyone present, the one constant was a desire to redeem the Empire, in the eyes of God and the people.\n\nAs the event came to its end, Viktoria found herself in front of the Icon again, praying that the future was one that would make it all worth it."

It had been easy at first. The Tsar's forces were overstretched and unable to cope with the guerilla war that he and other remnants of the Red Army were waging. More recently, Imperial forces had been reinforced and bolstered with new weapons and veteran troops. As a result, raids on Imperial supply lines had gotten more and more difficult. His men were starving and their weapons were running dangerously low on ammo. So, when one of his men handed him a letter from the Tsar himself he didn't immediately throw it in the fire. Pavel broke the seal on the letter and began to read.\n\n"To the valiant soldiers of the West Russian Revolutionary Front,\n\nEven as we are at odds, I cannot help but feel a sense of true admiration for your valor and tenacity. You have continued to fight, against all odds, long after any reasonable man would consider your job done.\n\nI know that you have no reason to trust in the Imperial system, the flaws of the old Empire were many and the people suffered greatly for it. However, I must ask that you lay down your arms for the good of the Russian people. The future of Russia is at stake and in order to lessen the harm on the people we must reconcile.\n\nIn the interests of peace and unity in the Empire I offer to you and all of your compatriots amnesty against all charges that could be levelled against you in exchange for your surrender. You have my word that I will not allow any harm to come to you.\n\nSigned, Tsar Vladimir III."\n\nPavel stared hard at the letter in his hands as he weighed his options.

The destructive and murderous end of the old Tsardom weighed heavily on his mind.\n\nAs if sensing his fears, Shulgin spoke. "My Tsar, I understand your worries. Though I look on those days quite fondly, I am not blind to the flaws and excesses of the old Empire. We have been given a chance to rebuild and use what we have learned to build a stronger Empire. I know that the transition will be a strange one for us all, until now you have ruled much like your ancestors once did," Shulgin knew all too well of his Tsar's fears. Until the Congress he had been the undisputed power in Vyatka, his every word had been law. To have to give that up would be difficult for even the purest of men.\n\nShulgin knew that, even more than the loss of personal power, the Tsar feared for the ability of his party to protect his people. For all that you could say about the Tsar and his mistakes, one thing that could not be overstated was his care for the people. When he had unilateral powers he could ensure that his people were taken care of directly. Now he had to place his trust in political creatures like Shulgin and his party. "I understand that it is difficult to put your trust in me. You must know that I will do all that is in my power to ensure the prosperity and protection of our people."\n\nThe Tsar sat in silence for a time, mulling over a thousand and more thoughts in his head. He knew that his privileges and powers would be limited going forward, but at the same time the Conservative constitution would give him wide latitudes to ensure his vision of the country would survive.

They were usually privy to the goings on within the Duma, but they had been summoned early in the day before any of them could hear news from the session. Solzhenitsyn continued: "As of the end of today's legisaltive session I have been granted emergency powers for unilateral action within the Empire.

Recalling the nostalgia of the old empire, they made it clear they fought for conservative but democratic values. Little arguments for reform could be found among their statement, and they ultimately established themselves as a clear status quo candidate.\n\nNext came the speech from the NTS. Populism, nationalism, freedom and monarchism were their four key sticking points. They made a firm argument towards rejecting the ideas of both liberalism and communism, of holding the Russian man above any such system.

Strife and warfare had been constants in his life which he rarely shied away from, yet as he walked down the aisle leading to His Imperial Majesty's suites, a slight feeling of nervousness rose in his chest as he prepared himself for his scheduled meeting.

As thoughts raced in his mind, Roman started elaborating on his reform plans to the Tsar:\n\n"As I evoked in the past Your Imperial Majesty, we cannot go on with how poorly regarded personal freedoms are in Russia: the people, Russian and non-Russian speaking citizens, is - and should always be - our priority. Each and every one of your subjects deserve better lives, brighter futures, and though much has been done under your reign, absolute rule and austerity measures cannot be the norm forever. Now that Western Russia is stable, I come seeking your blessing and help in enacting a better tomorrow for our countrymen. Lest we fall to chaos and infighting again if their words cannot reach us."\n\nGul wasn't wrong: Western Russia was under complete control and those pesky austerity measures could be loosened, if not removed entirely.

When he had first come to Russia, when he had led his people from the dreary lands around Vyatka to dominate over all of Western Russia, he had been a monarch with power. Real power, like the Romanovs of old. But ever since the conclusion of the Vologda Congress, that power had been taken away from him, piece by piece.\n\nThe Solidarists had triumphed, their message of national strength and reclamation resonating with the - his - people, and Solzhenitsyn had quickly moved to consolidate his government's power, both within the constitution and outside it.\n\n'Temporary' laws were passed in his name, and 'national security' initiatives restricted the rights of millions of Russians. And there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nOh, he gave speeches, visited factories, and presided over the now-defanged Council. But the speeches were delivered to him, the tours were guided, and the Council packed with Solidarist sympathizers. He knew that his ancestors would never have allowed such to happen. But, clearly, he was not like them at all.\n\nAnd so he sat in the darkness, considering who he had been, and who he would never be."

In particular, there remain many adherents to the great cancer that is communism. They must be rooted out, lest the ideology that led Russia to abject ruin and tyranny resurface to do so once again.\n\nProactive measures will be taken. A combination of propaganda efforts and a national re-education campaign, along with a coordinated offensive between the Okhrana, ordinary police, and military forces, will be put into action.

Interrogation of these individuals, in turn, provides additional intelligence on others, and as such the pace of our efforts are accelerating.\n\nHowever, we must also report that efforts to secure local support through the use of targeted informational campaigns have proven less successful, and can likely be attributed to anti-monarchist sentiment reinforced by previous regimes. We do believe, however and despite the cost, that continuing them, until such time as they are effective, is a worthy investment. Without constant local repudiation of your government, and with additional economic investment within the region forthcoming, in time support can be achieved.\n\nWe will, in any case, continue to ensure the security of the state.\n\nYours,\nBoris Smyslovsky\nChief of the Okhrana."

Which, to Solzhenitsyn, meant everyone outside of the Solidarist movement.\n\nIn stark contrast, within the movement he was seen as a hero, the one man willing to do what was necessary to ensure the safety and stability of the Empire. To do what was necessary to prepare it for the no-doubt terrible hardships and conflicts ahead. If they had known what he really thought, however, he doubted they would idolize him so.\n\nHe was well aware of his own, and his movement's, mortality. Fundamentally authoritarian, he knew that the history books of generations to come were unlikely to be kind to him. But that was a price he was willing to pay. For the moment Russia needed to be strong. Not good, or equal, or even honest. But strong. Survival was, for the foreseeable future, more important than happiness or freedom.\n\nHe looked out the window, towards the west where he knew the work crews would be moving to build the roads he had authorized earlier that day.

Wearing a relaxed shirt and comfortable shoes, he looked almost human. Something that Shulgin knew could not be countenanced outside of these private rooms.\n\nHe watched as the Tsar dismissed his valet, crossed the room, and sat in his char. "Sit, Vasily," Vladimir commanded, a slight smile on his face. Shulgin obeyed.\n\n"Majesty," he replied, "thank you for making time for me. I am most pleased to have been invited to form your government, and I pledge to serve you, and this Empire, faithfully." He could help but feel the weight, the responsibility, of those words.\n\nVladimir smiled again, and Shulgin could not help but, for a moment, see the Tsar as a boy. A boy from a family that he had failed once, long, long ago.

They had come so close, so close to achieving a position of power from which real change could be promoted. But, in the end, it had not been enough.\n\nThe people had chosen tradition over progress, and it would not be the Kadets, but Shulgin and his Conservatives who would form government. Still, he had thought, not all was lost. Enough Kadets had been elected to constitute a major power bloc, and he had hoped they would be able to both negotiate for positive reform and obstruct stagnation, where possible. And then he had been granted a 'prestigious' appointment in Syktyvkar - by the Tsar himself.\n\nOne could not refuse an Imperial appointment, and so he had packed his bags, made his way to the conquered capital, and assumed his, as he quickly discovered, powerless post. Shulgin had sent him somewhere he could not cause trouble. Could not push his agenda. But even subjected to internal exile, Gul would not allow the ideals to which he had dedicated his life be forgotten.\n\nMany in Komi were facing discrimination, and if he filed his report on time, there remained a chance that someone with real power might do something about it.\n\nHe had gambled on longer chances before."

So quickly that, if the trend continued, ethnic Russians would constitute a plurality just in time for the municipal elections.\n\nHe looked at the envelope on the counter - a letter from his sister in Izhvesk. He had not returned to Udmurt lands in years, for he had until now very much enjoyed living in Ufa. He did not look like the Bashkirs or pray to the same god, but he had been welcomed all the same. In Ufa, all those who had lived in the Russians' shadow for so long were welcome to share in the sunlight.\n\nBut now the Russians had returned, for better or worse, and how long would it be before he was once again seen as an outsider in a Russian city?
