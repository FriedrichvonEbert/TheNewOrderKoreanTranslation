 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "Born into exile in 1917, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov became head of the exiled Imperial Family of Russia in 1938 following the death of his father Kirill Vladimirovich, cousin of the late Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nResiding in Brittany when the Second World War, he soon found himself and his family in German custody. At the 'insistence' of German authorities, he soon began collaborating, making radio broadcasts encouraging Russian defection from the Soviet regime. Offered the regency of Ukraine at the end of the war, he turned it down on the grounds that it would unacceptably divide Russia.\n\nDespite the war's end, however, Vladimir could not return to Russia - the Germans were concerned that, like as had happened with Vlasov, his popularity could undermine their rule. It wasn;t until the West Russian War that he was able to convince them to permit his rallying a division of monarchists and exiled Whites to lead a wildly successful counteroffensive. As the Wehrmacht offensive stalled, the Grand Duke's did not, breaking through the Red lines and establishing a pocket of monarchist rule in Russia for the first time since 1918.\n\nIn the years since, the newly-proclaimed Tsar Vladimir III has had little success in expanding that pocket, and has found many dometic headaches besides. Now the Tsar waits, biding his time until the moment where he can strike, and reclaim all of Russia - his by divine birthright."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC:0 "The story of West Russia's last monarch, Boris I, is a bizarre, yet fascinating one. Boris Mikhailovich Skosyrev was born to a rich family in Vilna, then part of the Russian Empire. While he was a member of a family that belonged to the gentry, he was never a claimant to any throne by birth - but what he couldn't get through his bloodline, he would earn on his own.\n\nWhen the October Revolution broke out, Boris fled and became one of the many emigrés. He would soon distinguish himself in the British Foreign Office, partaking in many missions before arriving in the Netherlands and then finding where his most famous adventure so far would unfold: the country of Andorra. After carefully plotting, he took the title of Prince with popular support in the 1930s, and promised to bring Andorra into the modern age. He would soon be arrested and imprisoned, but luckily, after spending a few years in prisons around Western Europe, he would be released by the Nazi occupation authorities and begin to collaborate with them. With the advent of the West Russian War and Tsar Vladimir's expedition, he gladly joined him, and stood by him as a loyal liaison - until it became inconvenient to do so.\n\nSkossyrev would not stay idle as the Anti-Communist Guard achieved victory after victory. One day, as the troops came closer to Vyatka, he would come to the city center, guns blazing, and declare the former West Russian authority to have ended, replaced by Kirpichnikov's army. In the place of the city's corrupt rulers, Boris I now rules as Prince of Vyatka and guardian of the frontier, in the name of the Anti-Communist Guard and the Russian people. For how long this principality will last, who knows."
 
 ### Leader Traits ###
 the_rightful_heir:0 "The Rightful Heir"
 
 ### Ideas ###
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction:0 "Unrepentant Reaction"
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the old empire Russia has suffered, crushed beneath one tyrant after another. Communism, and its cloaked agent socialism, have worked tirelessly to take away what little the Russian people have left, and to this the Tsar has proclaimed 'No more!' The Empire will rise again, the communists will be destroyed, and with the Tsar's just rule, peace will again return to this great land."

 KIR_officer_infighting:0 "Military Infighting"
 KIR_officer_infighting_desc:0 "The White Army, or what remains of it, has never been a unified front. Though a shared hatred of communism unites them, the question of how a unified Russia should be governed threatens to shatter the unity of the Tsar's armies. While some believe in the old ideals, others petition for democracy, and a few even speak of the strengths of fascistic regimes. The Tsar alone is the only thing keeping them in line, and even then only just. It is clear that if the state is to rebuild what was once lost, it must work to ensure that the army stands united."

 KIR_officers_reigned_in:0 "Officers Reined in"
 KIR_officers_reigned_in_desc:0 "Though difficult, the state has succeeded in curbing both the worst influences of, and actions taken by, its military officer corps. Though it will take time, political influence, and cause manpower disruptions as problematic officers are cashiered or prosecuted, the Tsar can be confident that his officers will soon be united in purpose. Divided leadership will no longer negatively affect our armies."

 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself:0 "The Tsar and Himself"
 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself_desc:0 "Like in the old days, the Tsar rules with absolute power. Lately, however, he has witnessed the rise of liberalism and democratic ideals within the hearts and minds of his subjects. Though many advise him to ignore these developments altogether, the Tsar knows well that he stands on a precipice, where the love of his people could very quickly turn into hatred, the way it has before. He must, therefore, soon make a choice: To rule alone, as his ancestors did, or to give the people their own say in his government."

 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea:0 "The People's Emperor"
 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea_desc:0 "In keeping with his effort to demonstrate solidarity with every one of his many subjects, the Tsar has embarked on a whirlwind tour of the many factories and industrial facilities in the state, meeting with workers and acting to solve the problems that most affect them. Though none can find fault with the political benefit of doing so, and while the Tsar's personal attention will no doubt result in factories doing their best to demonstrate elevated production levels, it is likely that efficiency will be hampered as the declared 'solutions' are suddenly implemented."

 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea:0 "Imperial Detachment"
 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea_desc:0 "The Tsar's decision to preserve that intangible aspect of character critical to his role as a monarch, as well as to focus on matters of state rather than matters of publicity, has resulted in his personal withdrawal from many events, even as his person remains in the minds of all those present. While this is no doubt reassuring to many, who can be secure in the knowledge that their Tsar is fixing problems before they become apparent to society at large, making his position known to the public through functionaries does require additional efforts to be made."

 KIR_kirov_vodka:0 "Vyatka Vodka"
 KIR_kirov_vodka_desc:0 "The Vyatka distilleries are in full operation, producing enormous quantities of high-quality spirits that can be consumed at home, exported abroad, or used in medical and military settings as a high-quality antiseptic. Although it might seem humorous to some, vodka is a Russian staple, and with thoughts of the Tsar accompanying every bottle consumed, all are inspired to work harder and waste less in pursuit of the dream of unification."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana:0 "A Modern Age Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_desc:0 "The Tsar has wisely reconstituted the Okhrana, the Imperial intelligence and counter-revolutionary police force. With resources so dedicated, and with the knowledge that they shield the state from enemies both foreign and domestic, they will act to improve the state's cryptographic capabilities as well as minimize the operations of bandit and partisan strikes on its forces. In addition, and through the sharing of obtained information, they will also serve to better the tactical dispositions of military commanders in the field."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2:0 "A Shackled Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2_desc:0 "Although critical to national security, the Okhrana cannot be permitted to operate without oversight. As a result, a supervisory body has been established to prevent excesses. Though this naturally reduces its effectiveness, it is a small price to pay to ensure that overzealous actions do not threaten political stability."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3:0 "A Strengthened Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3_desc:0 "Without the constant vigilance of the Okhrana, the Tsar's government would have long ago fallen to revolutionaries, traitors, or worse. It must therefore be given wide latitude to intercept and eliminate potential threats before they become real ones. Though it is likely that some 'mistakes' will be made, it is a small price to pay to ensure the security of the state."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet:0 "A Shackled Okhrana"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_kadet_desc:0 "Although critical to national security, the Okhrana cannot be permitted to operate without oversight. As a result, a supervisory body has been established to prevent excesses. Though this naturally reduces its effectiveness, it is a small price to pay to ensure that overzealous actions do not threaten political stability."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea:0 "White Army Traditions"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_desc:0 "By directly connecting the traditions of the army to that of the old, uncorrupted Imperial state, the Tsar has encouraged the formation of a true modern army with Russian sensibilities. Disciplined, proud, meritocratic, and well-organized, it is far superior to the 'armies' of the many Russian statelets, and will proudly carry the banner through both European Russia and on the long journey to the Far East."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2:0 "White Army Traditions"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea2_desc:0 "By directly connecting the traditions of the army to that of the old, uncorrupted Imperial state, the Tsar has encouraged the formation of a true modern army with Russian sensibilities.

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_kadet:0 "White Army Traditions"

 KIR_imperial_special_forces:0 "Imperial Special Forces"
 KIR_imperial_special_forces_desc:0 "As part of the state's reorientation away from tradition and towards modern approaches to warfare, an increased focus has been placed on the selection and training of specialist formations. While this focus certainly increases the efficacy of these special units, the stringent requirements for induction within them has resulted, at least temporarily, in an overall reduction of recruitment efforts."

 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea:0 "Strength in Numbers"
 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea_desc:0 "Holding true to the classical Russian focus on manpower and numerical superiority, the state's military has vastly expanded recruitment, relaxing standards and searching for recruits outside traditional areas. While this does mean many more soldiers will be entering the Tsar's armies, it also means that they are, at least for a time, likely to be somewhat less effective as training programs are stretched beyond their natural limits."

 KIR_general_staff_academy:0 "The Vyatka General Staff Academy"
 KIR_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "The establishment of a unified, and universal, training curriculum for the state's military officers has, as expected, resulted in an overall increase in military capability. Properly trained officers, operating from common ground, have proven their skills in everything from administrative organization to entrenchment to the identification of future leadership candidates. Confidence is growing."

Confidence is growing."

 KIR_fortified_position:0 "Fortified Position"
 KIR_fortified_position_desc:0 "The state has moved to consolidate its territory following recent gains. As a result, military formations have been oriented towards defensive purposes while supply lines are strengthened, partisans and bandits eliminated, and future priorities identified."

 KIR_archives_of_samara:0 "Archives of Samara"
 KIR_archives_of_samara_desc:0 "Samara served as an evacuation point for Soviet state records during their collapse in the Second World War. With the state's capture of the city and careful examination of said archives, valuable insights into the personalities and responses of the West Russian Revolutionary Front (WRRF) have been obtained, assisting in future combat against them."

 KIR_the_bridgeburners:0 "The Bridgeburners"
 KIR_the_bridgeburners_desc:0 "The Special Imperial Operations Unit, better known as the 'Bridgeburners,' is a specialized force composed of both military and Okhrana personnel tasked with direct-action operations behind enemy lines. Attacking convoys, assassinating lone officers and, yes, destroying bridges, their activities will hamper the defensive capabilities of the state's enemies, even before its soldiers arrive to engage them."

 KIR_solidarist_constitution:0 "The Imperial Constitution"
 KIR_solidarist_constitution_desc:0 "The state has successfully drafted the first Imperial Constitution of the revived Russian Empire. Whatever its particulars, this is an enormous accomplishment, demonstrating the return of political stability to Russia - under the Tsar and the Romanov dynasty!"

 KIR_solidarist_economy:0 "A Planned Economy"
 KIR_solidarist_economy_desc:0 "Applying their policies of corporatism to the plans of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the Solidarists have enshrined the input of interest groups and concentrated economic sectors within industrial planning. This has a corresponding benefit on efficiency, as the common motivation to reduce waste is focused upon."

 KIR_decommunization:0 "Decommunization"
 KIR_decommunization_desc:0 "In an effort to purge the nation of commnunist-based revolutionary elements, the state has begun an official program of communication. Literature, monuments, and anything else associated with previous communist regimes are being destroyed, and former communist officials are being investigated to determine the suitability of amnesties - following public repudiation, of course."

 KIR_ural_reconstruction_program:0 "Ural Reconstruction Program"
 KIR_ural_reconstruction_program_desc:0 "Following the conquest of the regions surrounding the Ural Mountains, the state has begun a program of rapid reconstruction using military-based formations in order to ensure that industry within the region is normalized to the rest of the nation. . While a significant investment, it is likely to have positive effects both on industrial efficiency as well as the security of formations as long as it is active."

 KIR_return_of_the_tsar:0 "Return of the Emperor"
 KIR_return_of_the_tsar_desc:0 "The emergence of Vyatka, a monarchist state, in a land that had executed its previous monarchs was one of the stranger outcomes of the West Russian War. And yet, to many, it was understandable.\n\nCommunism had utterly failed the Russian people, leading them into subjugation under a foreign regime, and a return to earlier times, when Russia imposed its will on others, rather than being imposed upon itself, was inherently attractive.\n\nTsar Vladimir has shown to the people the qualities expected of an Emperor, sharing in their pain from and anger at the German bombers that terrorize them regularly. And he has pledged that, in due time, he will see their skies cleared, their land reclaimed, and their Imperial eagle proudly displayed from the Volga to the Amur."

 KIR_an_economic_graveyard:0 "An Economic Graveyard"
 KIR_an_economic_graveyard_desc:0 "Across all of Western Russia, regular bombing missions by the German Luftwaffe make it impossible to maintain an economy of any reasonable size of complexity. Anything resembling a factory is identified, targetted, and destroyed. This is by design. The Germans know that if they can keep us from industrializing they can keep us from unifying against them.\n\nWe may not be able to build an industrial base at the moment, but that does not mean we must remain idle. We can evaluate our resources, identify skilled workers, and plan future development sites. We can prepare as much as we are able. If we are to reclaim Russia for the Romanov dynasty, we must have industry.\n\nOne day, the bombings will, must, stop. And when they do, we will be ready."

 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery:0 "The Vyatka Distillery"
 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery_desc:0 "To many Russians, a stable supply of good-quality vodka is considered as essential as food itself. As a result of devastation from both the war and the German bombing campaigns, such a product has become scarce. And therein lies an opportunity that the Tsar has proposed to exploit.\n\nPotatoes will be planted and farmed in bulk, providing food, employment, and raw materials for the spirit. Distilleries will be reclaimed and reconstituted to transform those materials into high-quality vodka, proving yet more employment, addressing domestic demand, and supplying the state with a valuable - and highly desired - trade good.\n\nThe revenue from selling vodka all over Russia will finance other projects, and with every bottle sold, one more Russian will know that their Tsar understands their needs."

 KIR_alternative_uses:0 "Alternative Uses"
 KIR_alternative_uses_desc:0 "The high-quality alcohol produced by state distilleries, though eminently valuable for trade, can also be used as an effective antiseptic. In Russia, where injury is a fact of life and medical infrastructure is frequently fragile, this is valuable almost beyond compare.\n\nBy constructing laboratories adjacent to our new distilleries, we can render some of the produced spirits into medical-grade disinfectant, and supply both our civilian and military hospitals with a reliable and steady supply. We can, in a similar fashion, also package some of it for export, increasing trade, generating capital and, perhaps, civilizing warfare in Russia ever so slightly."

 KIR_the_imperial_potato_act:0 "The Imperial Potato Act"
 KIR_the_imperial_potato_act_desc:0 "The success of the Tsar's initiative to develop a distillation industry has been successful. Too successful. While employment has risen and much needed hard currency, earned from export, has begun to enter the economy at long last, we have a serious problem. There are simply not enough potatoes to keep up with demand. We must take action.\n\nThe solution is the Imperial Potato Act, providing increasing subsidies in taxes, land, and labor for farmers who agree to dedicate certain percentages of their arable land to potatoes.\n\nThe increased production will allow for more vodka to be bottled, which will also allow us to begin increasing the amount of it we export. It won't be long until the Bretons, French, Germans, and more all agree that the finest Russian vodka comes from Vyatka."

 KIR_find_new_markets:0 "Find New Markets"
 KIR_find_new_markets_desc:0 "Optimizations made to the Vyatka distilleries in recent times have resulted in even greater production than before. We simply cannot sell it all, on either the domestic or local foreign markets, without an unacceptable reduction in price. The solution, therefore, must lie further afield.\n\nBrittany, the Tsar's former home, has in recent years embraced an identity as a nexus of legal and extralegal trade, and this offers an opportunity. Although sales likely won't reach the same levels as in Russia, they will act to reduce our vast stockpiles, protect our prices, and bring in hard currency besides."

 KIR_rolling_on_the_river:0 "Rolling on the River"
 KIR_rolling_on_the_river_desc:0 "River transport has long been a mainstay of Russian commerce and trade. Transport along them is often much faster than moving overland, and this is doubly so in current times, given the state of Russian infrastructure. Though we no longer control great rivers such as the Dnieper, the Don, or the Volga, we do control the Vyatka River, and it connects into a vast network of other rivers across Western Russia.\n\nBy re-opening the city's wharves and promoting the construction of river barges and other tradecraft, we can compensate for our infrastructure and increase trade both internally and externally. Perhaps, in time, Vyatka itself will become a hub for such activity."

 KIR_the_kostroma_pipeline:0 "The Kostroma Pipeline"
 KIR_the_kostroma_pipeline_desc:0 "The establishment of trade connections with the Bretons has proven very beneficial, allowing us an outlet for our excess production of both alcohol as well as other goods. But Brittany is far away, and transporting good there is in itself a risk. We need somewhere closer.\n\nKostroma, as a free city situated on the border of the German sphere, is perfectly situated. The porous border allows for the easy transport of goods into the Reich, and while the Germans are not our friends any longer, their money is just as good as anyone else's. We will take it. Until the empire is strong enough not to need to."

 KIR_a_new_hub_of_trade:0 "A New Hub of Trade"
 KIR_a_new_hub_of_trade_desc:0 "Our efforts to encourage trade have proven wildly successful . With the identification and prioritization of key trade goods, the development of international connections, and the promotion of rapid and efficient arteries of trade among the Russian waterways, Vyatka has exploded in activity. The city's wharves are bustling, merchants are moving ever larger carhoes, and revenue increases month-over-month. However, the Tsar and those who advise him are always looking forward.\n\nA plan to establish Vyatka as a central trade hub for Western Russia has been put forward and accepted. Infrastructure will be vastly expanded, allowing for consequent expansions in trade and other forms of commerce and ensuring a dominating future position for Vyatka as a city, and contributing to a strong financial base for campaigns to come."

 KIR_imperial_austerity:0 "Imperial Austerity"
 KIR_imperial_austerity_desc:0 "Following an exhaustive audit of the Principality's economy in its entirety, both the Tsar and his ministers have been shocked to learn of its true, highly decrepit, state. Factories lie abandoned, as artisans produce what little they can in basement workshops. Fields lie fallow, as farmers focus on subsistence farming to feed themselves and their families. If action is not taken, our fragile economy will soon collapse entirely.\n\nTo address this, a plan for austerity has been put before the Tsar. Severe cuts to services, education, and security will be painful, especially for the many already suffering. But they are necessary. And the Tsar has been very clear - they will not last forever."

 KIR_moderate_austerity_programs:0 "Moderate Austerity Programs"
 KIR_moderate_austerity_programs_desc:0 "The Tsar and his government are in agreement that a program of austerity is necessary in order to prevent economic collapse. But consideration must also be given to the effect it will have on our people, who have already endured years of suffering. A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has chosen to moderate the proposal. Cuts will be made, some quite painful, but they will be compassionate. The Tsar will not impose undue burden on his people, and sectors that are identified as critical to the basic needs of the population will be spared the worst of the reductions. A Russia without its people is no Russia at all."

 KIR_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 KIR_public_works_projects_desc:0 "Two horrific wars, a breakdown of central authority, and the regular German bombing of anything of value has resulted in the almost complete destruction of any Russian infrastructure worthy of the name. In both our state and elsewhere, ordinary Russians rely on local paths and trail guides for most travel. That naturally strangles trade, industrial and economic development, and military operations. It must be addressed.\n\nTo solve this, The Tsar and his government will fund public works projects throughout the Principality, building new infrastructure and repairing the old while also providing employment. The Germans will destroy some of it, of course, but we will maintain commitment, whatever the cost. The future demands it."

 KIR_imperial_bank_of_russia:0 "Imperial Bank of Russia"
 KIR_imperial_bank_of_russia_desc:0 "The breakdown of Russia's industrial economy was accompanied by the breakdown of any reliable system of banking. The result has been the near-complete absence of appreciable investment or credit, lack of confidence in currencies, a return to the hoarding of precious metals, and the development of a barter-based economy amongst citizens.\n\nWith the establishment of public works and austerity programs, the next step is to rectify this critical issue through the creation of a central bank. Such a creation will help to legitimize, promote trust in, and set policy for our currency. Further, it will allow for both the stimulation and regulation of commercial and private lenders, encouraging economic growth in all sectors."

 KIR_more_extreme_measures:0 "More Extreme Measures"
 KIR_more_extreme_measures_desc:0 "The Tsar and his government are in agreement that a program of austerity is necessary in order to prevent economic collapse. But consideration must also be given to the effect it will have on our people, who have already endured years of suffering. A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has made that hard choice. Infrastructure, healthcare, social programs, and more will be cut to the bone in order to establish the state's financial security and provide a basis for our future designs of territorial reclamation. The people will not be happy, but in time they will learn that the Tsar is planning for their future just as much as his own."

 KIR_divert_funds_to_the_military:0 "Divert Funds to the Military"
 KIR_divert_funds_to_the_military_desc:0 "Though painful, our severe cuts to the state budget have resulted in a surplus of assignable funds. Dedicating them to the military is an obvious choice - without secure control of our lands we cannot accomplish anything of note. Additional resources will allow them to recruit more soldiers, acquire more equipment, and improve their readiness.\n\nWe do, however, expect a negative response from the public, given what they have had to surrender in order to make this military expansion a possibility. Nevertheless, we are committed - regardless of the unpopularity of this action, we are preparing for the future of all of Russia, and in time the public will understand."

 KIR_tax_the_commoners:0 "Increase Taxes"
 KIR_tax_the_commoners_desc:0 "Despite our harsh austerity measures, we have not reduced expenditures to a sufficient degree. Revenue must therefore increase, and the only appreciable way to do that is through significant increases in taxation. Levies on a wide basket of basic and consumer goods should be sufficient, and though it will cause further public discontent, there is currently no other choice available.\n\nIt is, however, believed that this measure should be the last required in order to obtain the funds needed for significant public investments, which would then permit the relaxation of austerity programs. We will show our citizens that their anger has been misplaced. But they must endure for a little while longer."

 KIR_start_of_the_recovery:0 "Start of the Recovery"
 KIR_start_of_the_recovery_desc:0 "The light can finally be seen. Although painful, the austerity measures we imposed managed to prevent total collapse, and the strategic investments made are finally beginning to have an effect. Economic activity has sharply increased, and new workshops and industries have begun to appear organically.\n\nWe must remain vigilant, however, expanding previously reduced programs as revenues rise and instituting reforms as needed. The road ahead to complete unification under the Tsar is and will be a long one, but we have done what we can to give ourselves, and our people, the best start possible."

 KIR_legacy_of_the_tsardom:0 "Legacy of the Empire"
 KIR_legacy_of_the_tsardom_desc:0 "Decades ago Russia, the Third Rome, was a great nation. And then the communists tore it down. They seduced her peasants with lies. They seized the great wealth of her learned classes. They murdered her rulers as if they were ordinary criminals. And then they failed, twice, at protecting her from rapacious invaders.\n\nAlthough the scars of their crimes remain, there is still hope. Tsar Vladimir, proud scion of the Romanovs, has returned. It is his divine right to rule Russia and its people, and when opportunity presents itself, he will crush the bandits, fascists, communists, and fanatics that have conspired to tear Russia apart.\n\nThe Third Rome will rise again."

 KIR_a_tangled_web:0 "A Tangled Web"
 KIR_a_tangled_web_desc:0 "The fall of the old empire was accelerated by poor administrative capability, which then allowed for both economic malaise and communist extremism to spread. Apart from the Tsar himself, we are seeing this in the Principality, with many of the 'temporary' government organs established years ago still in operation. We must learn from the past, and not allow it to be repeated.\n\nConsequently, we will act decisively to untangle this web, clearing out redundant offices, formalizing needed governmental services, and dispatching with wasteful excess. In such a way, we will strengthen our control over both our current, and future, territory."

 KIR_the_great_game:0 "The Great Game"
 KIR_the_great_game_desc:0 "Influence peddling is a component of any government, and the Tsar's administration is no exception. On a daily basis deals are made and broken, favours are traded, and information is exchanged amongst the many functionaries of our state.\n\nBut there is a limit, and the degree of these exchanges have, recently, threatened to divide the government to an unacceptable degree. The Tsar is not blind to this, and he knows that such efforts distract from any eventual efforts to reunify the nation. But he also knows that to act to reduce it could engender the opposite effect. Prudence is required.\n\nHe will therefore demonstrate his public displeasure with such actions, weakening the positions of those engaging in them without provoking conflict. But he will not forget, and when the state is more secure there will be a reckoning."

 KIR_fifty_shades_of_monarchism:0 "The Many Shades of Monarchism"
 KIR_fifty_shades_of_monarchism_desc:0 "Monarchism is not in itself an ideology, and as such it tends to attract a coalition of those of many different political persuasions. Our Principality is no different. While all agree that Tsar Vladimir is the rightful ruler of all of Russia, they disagree on how his rule should be expressed.\n\nAbsolutists believe he should be unrestricted while constitutionalists believe there should be checks on his authority. Fascists, socialists, and others also routinely present their own views. All of these forms of monarchy, and a great deal more, are regularly advocated for. But none can say which will, eventually, emerge to dominate the others."

 KIR_utilize_the_okhrana:0 "Utilize the Okhrana"
 KIR_utilize_the_okhrana_desc:0 "Despite the Tsar's righteous rule, there are those who would see him shackled, deposed, or worse. Every society has its dissidents, and they must be watched. The Okhrana - the Tsar's secret police - was created to monitor and curtail the actions of those who wished the destruction of Russia. Though they failed in their mission, the lessons learned through that failure have not been forgotten.\n\nTo combat these dissidents, the Okhrana will be recreated, and the issues that led to their previous failure will be corrected. Once again they will watch over and guard our Tsar, our state, and our way of life. In so doing ensure the stability of our Principality and, one day, our Empire."

 KIR_form_the_imperial_council:0 "Form the Imperial Council"
 KIR_form_the_imperial_council_desc:0 "Even a man as dedicated and righteous as Tsar Vladimir cannot rule alone. Loyal retainers are needed, both as territorial administrators and as advisors on matters of state. As such, an Imperial Council will be established, allowing for the collection and application of the finest minds of the Principality to critical matters.\n\nThose so identified will include eminent figures in arts and sciences, experienced government functionaries, skilled military officers, and more. Their learned counsel will inform the Tsar about anything to which he is not aware, and should he be incapacitated for whatever reason, they can be trusted to maintain a regency until such time as the Tsar's duties can be resumed."

 KIR_the_peoples_tsar:0 "The People's Tsar"
 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_desc:0 "Though the Tsar is a man blessed and chosen by God to lead Russia onwards, he is, just like his subjects, a Russian. He understands the needs of the common man, and knows well that, but for the chance of divinity, he would be amongst them in the fields, the factory, or the social club. No longer will he remain in his palace. He will travel far and wide, he will speak directly to petitioners, and he will demonstrate his love for the country and the people firsthand.\n\nBy doing so, he will inherently disprove the propaganda of our enemies, who claim him a distant, tyrannical, and uncaring despot. And he will bind our people together, leading them towards the future, and securing peace and prosperity for all Russians - great and small alike."

 KIR_imperial_detachment:0 "Imperial Detachment"
 KIR_imperial_detachment_desc:0 "The Tsar is a Russian, yes, but he is also more than that. He is a symbol. An ideal. A figure that can be aspired to, and worked towards, but never reached. He is a man who can be trusted to remain above petty rivalries, factionalism, and self-interest, and dispassionately look at an issue from all sides before making the best decision possible. This identity, this image, must be protected.\n\nThe Tsar will remain separate from the people, interacting with them through ministers, functionaries, and officers. In this way he will always be present in their minds, a reassuring presence, every time they see our flag or speak to a representative of the state. This will be how we safeguard Russia against the destruction that once consumed it, and it will be how we guarantee prosperity and peace to our children."

 KIR_a_cultured_court:0 "A Cultured Court"
 KIR_a_cultured_court_desc:0 "For generations, Russia's Imperial court was known the world over for its splendor, its opulence, and the concentration of artists and intellectuals that surrounded it. If our goal is to revive Russia in body, we must begin by reviving Russia in spirit, and so re-establish its cultural and intellectual heart.\n\nWe will generate and distribute generous grants to artists, poets, musicians, and intellecutals. We will invite them to our court and grant them citizenship in our lands, and commission vast quantities of artwork, composition, poetry, and more. We will usher in a new generation of Russian culture and, in time, Russia will once again be known as a beacon of culture and the arts, with the Tsar as its greatest patron."

 KIR_the_tsars_speech:0 "The Tsar's Speech"
KIR_the_tsars_speech_desc:0 "The Tsar's frequent radio addresses to the Principality are, naturally, a great source of comfort for its citizens, demonstrating to them that their monarch carries them in his thoughts at all times. Following yet another German bombing raid, he has decided to give another.\n\nUnusually, he has taken in active role in its drafting, carefully determining both the content and method of presentation, and word has spread that this address is unlikely to be like all the others. From all corners of our realm, the Tsar's subjects huddle around radios, improvised or otherwise.\n\nAnd await the words of their sovereign."

 KIR_the_bishop_of_vyatka:0 "The Bishop of Vyatka"
 KIR_the_bishop_of_vyatka_desc:0 "Historically, the role of the Orthodox Church in the Russian state was almost as central as that of the monarchy itself. Despite this, the relationship between the Tsar and the Church in recent years has been, if not antagonistic, fairly cold. Many within believe the Tsar insufficiently pious, and this is beginning to affect his perceived legitimacy. A solution must be found, and quickly.\n\nThe diocese of Vyatka is currently vacant, and if a bishop were appointed it would, in addition to publicly confirming the Tsar's dedication to the Church and acting to reaffirm his bond to it, provide valuable moral guidance to our citizens, ever in danger of being led astray."

 KIR_emigre_support:0 "Émigré Support"
 KIR_emigre_support_desc:0 "The fall of the old empire resulted in the exile of hundreds of thousands of Russia's best and brightest, to all corners of the world. Many of them took their riches along, and many others still have found wealth and success in their new homes. But they have not forgotten their old one.\n\nThe Tsar still possesses contacts from his time spent living in Brittany, and through them he would be able to establish contact with the most prominent of their number. Many of them desire to once again see the Imperial eagle fly above a united Russia, and would be willing to provide both financial and political support."

That our once-great nation is reduced to this is a tragedy beyond measure, but it is not yet beyond hope. Russia is no stranger to suffering, or to staring over, but it needs leadership, strong and noble, in order to do so. And we will provide it.\n\nJust as Peter the Great elevated Russia to its deserved position as a world power, so too will Tsar Vladimir. He will make it clear that order, strength, prosperity, and faith will be returned to our country, whatever the cost.\n\nWe will reclaim our birthright."

 KIR_seize_illegal_convoys:0 "Seize Illegal Convoys"
 KIR_seize_illegal_convoys_desc:0 "The political chaos of the Republic of Komi has led to an explosion of smuggling activity along our border with it. Here, hundreds of 'merchants' flagrantly flout the Principality's laws, depriving our state of taxation and legitimate trade. The time has come to respond. Decisively.\n\nWe will increase our military and police presence along the border, arresting known dealers, inspecting all passing cargoes, and raiding discovered hideouts. Seized goods will be either sold or incorporated into stockpiles as necessary. In addition, and once the smugglers are dispersed, we will then encourage and promote legitimate commerce in replacement, and thereby turn a weakness into a strength."

 KIR_white_army_traditions:0 "White Army Traditions"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_desc:0 "Long ago the Russian army - well trained, highly disciplined, and lavishly equipped - was a feared instrument of war. Then the rot set in. By 1917, it had progressed so far that not even the then-Tsar's personal intervention could save it, and its deficiencies were laid bare in its crushing defeat by the communist revolutionaries. But its earlier legacy still remains.\n\nWe will reinstate the practices that made the imperial armies great, once upon a time, and put in place stringent regulations to ensure that the practices that led to failure are not repeated. We will continue the legacy of the Russian army of old, and under that banner, our brave soldiers will march forward, and reclaim the motherland for themselves, their state, and their Tsar."

We have carried the torch of the Russian Empire through the darkest of days, and emerged in the light, strong and ready to march forward once again.\n\nWe will prepare for the campaigns to come, for the efforts to spread the culture and splendor we have built here, Russian splendor and culture, to all Russians.

It is that bond of mutual faith that gives us strength, and ensures the stability of our lands. But these lands are not enough. Russia is a vast country, and much of it lies shattered and broken under the heels of extremists, fanatics, and criminals alike.\n\nThe Tsar can no longer bear to see his people suffering so. Until the Imperial eagle flies from the German border to the Far East his, and our, mission will not be complete.

Beyond our borders, in the rightful lands of the Tsar, millions of Russians lie crushed under the boot of oppression and poverty, and they must be rescued.

Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov may have been born into exile, watching first from France and then Brittany as communism crushed his ancestral land under abject tyranny, but he has at last returned home.\n\nStyling himself as Tsar Vladimir III, and raising a German-sponsored force of exiles, émigrés, and any others who would fight, he captured the city of Vyatka amid the chaos of the West Russian War. Soon after, he declared the revival of the Russian Empire in both the city and the lands surrounding it.\n\nAs 1962 begins, the Tsar finds himself facing a series of monumental tasks. He must address the crippled Russian economy, an openly rebellious governor, hostile neighboring statelets, a divided army, an apathetic population and, greatest of all, how to advance his goal of the eventual unification of Russia under the Romanov dynasty.\n\nThe death of Nicholas II threw Russia into a chaos from which it has never recovered, but with the return of Vladimir III perhaps that chaos can be quelled, and a new, strong Imperial Russian state can rise from the ashes!"

With many of our officers carrying German equipment and having received German training, we have long looked for an opportunity to demonstrate our separation from the German regime. While we hesitate to call it 'fortunate,' one such an opportunity has presented itself.\n\nOur commanders have received reports that a small hilltop community near Izhevsk has been attacked by a group displaying common Nazi symbols. Although it is unknown whether they are a German raiding party or merely bandits from the fanatics of Perm, it is known that they are currently besieging the settlement, and that it cannot hold out for long.\n\nIn response, the Tsar has ordered a small task force, 300 strong and equipped with heavy weaponry, be dispatched to break the siege of the settlement, marked on military maps as Hill 483. In doing so, not only will the Tsar protect his people, but he will also prove that neither he nor his military have any remaining sympathy to Nazism or the odious individuals who practice it."

They clearly did not expect our forces to have brought artillery.\n\nTrapped between our soldiers and the community militia they had besieged, those raiders not eliminated by artillery fell quickly to gunfire from either the front or rear, and survivors quickly surrendered.\n\nAlthough a small action, our men received a heroes' welcome from the community, demonstrated their competence and professionalism, and showed both their own, as well as the Tsar's, willingness to directly confront Nazism in defense of the people."

In retrospect, this was clearly the optimal choice.\n\nAs our men advanced, the artillery commander refused the order to fire, citing unacceptable risk. Unsupported, our soldiers found themselves pinned down by machine gun fire, and suffered heavy casualties before being forced to retreat. So motivated, the raiders quickly overwhelmed the civilian militia atop Hill 483 and sacked the community before withdrawing from the field.\n\nAlthough a small action, our performance has led to accusations of both the possible incompetence of and Nazi sympathies within our military.

As such, in an attempt to boost his public perception, secure additional legitimacy, and support these brave pilots, the Tsar has, at personal expense, secured a number of previously decommissioned aircraft, as well as a large number of replacement parts for both them.\n\nHe will dispatch all of this, free of charge, to the Free Aviators, and in so doing help them fight for the nation he, one day, intends to rule in its entirety."

Such small scale industry but with a significant market across Russia would provide an excellent boost to our economy, the Emperor believes, and will open the door to more substantial industry in our future.\n\nIt will be some time before we can produce vodka en masse, and of a worthwhile quality, but the Emperor has authorized the necessary subsidies and investments to allow production to begin.

The only question is how severe the implementation of this austerity should be.\n\nThe majority of advisors have suggested moderation, applying significant, yet reasonable cuts to various public services, including education and healthcare. Some, however, have advised the Tsar that drastic times require drastic measures, and that the only way to ensure success is to enforce extreme reductions in the budgets of every government service, excepting only the military and specially identified initiatives.\n\nCuts of any kind will not be well-received by the populace, and so the Tsar must decide how much hardship he believes his subjects will be willing to face."

So focused, the Tsar did not notice his guest, a merchant captain, approach him.\n\n"Majesty?" the captain asked, "are you all right?"\n\nVladimir waved him away. "I'm fine," he lied. "Thank you." He swept his arm outwards, gesturing to the docks. "What was it you were saying earlier, Captain?"\n\n"Pirates, majesty" came the captain's reply. "It is known that there are river pirates downstream, along the major riverine trade routes. Both I and the other merchants have requested more guard detachments, seconded from the Imperial armies."\n\nThe Tsar hid his dismay, strong enough to break through even the intense discomfort of the migraine. Securing such detachments would require forcing a compromise between Gul, Shulgin, and Solzhenitsyn. As his head continues to throb, however, he responds:"

Avoiding the barge's lights, they aligned themselves with it and threw hooks up and over the side with the practiced ease of men who had performed the action dozens of times before. This time, however, things would be different.\n\nOn the deck, one of the additional guards assigned by the Tsar heard a noise and,investigating more closely, saw the hooks. Shouting an alarm, he kicked the hook away and began firing into the darkness, soon joined by both the barge's crew as well as other guards. When everything had calmed down and the sun began to rise, the guards found that the pirates had retreated without casualty.\n\nBut, at least for once, they had been denied their prize. And word would spread that the Tsar's soldiers now protected the river craft."

Nearby, the bodies of its crew, the captain among them, were found in a pile, having either been killed in an attack or executed following surrender. The work of river pirates - the same ones that the captain had feared. And that he had dismissed.\n\nThe cargo was gone and would not be recovered, and the pirates themselves would likely not operate within the Principality for some time - thereby escaping punishment. A feeling of guilt washed over the Tsar.\n\nSlumping in his chair, he felt it consume his thoughts. He had sent good and loyal men, men who had believed in his program of riverine trade, to their deaths. He had ignored their concerns. And though he knew the more important impact would be the loss of confidence in the program as a whole by the merchants, he could not get the captain's face out of his head.\n\nHe set the report down, and sighed again.

Moreover, they promised protection from the bandits who had plagued the settlement for years. And all they had asked for in return was accommodation.\n\nThe man had let one of them stay in his house, in the room of his late wife. Every morning they would share a meal before the soldier joined his compatriots on patrol, and when he returned they would share another. For two weeks this ritual repeated, and he had even asked the soldier, to a shrug in reply, why he was even here at all\n\nBut eventually that question was answered. Armed men under a strange banner were spotted nearby, and the soldiers quickly manned the positions they had been preparing for weeks. When the attackers - black-clad men with hateful fanaticism in their eyes - arrived, they charged headlong into the village. They were cut down where they stood.\n\nAfterwards, the soldiers assembled for a headcount, and all were present - except one. A search quickly found him lying behind an earthwork, shot through the chest, with blank eyes staring up at the sky. The man recognized the soldier from their shared meals, but hid his emotion with the ease of one long practiced in doing so.\n\nThe next morning, he volunteered to dig the soldier's grave, and fashioned a rough cross to mark it."

It would appear that Emperor Vladimir's government has recently constructed a vodka distillery within their territory and is looking for buyers. Well, if smuggling alcohol out of Russia is their goal, they could hardly have picked better people to do it. The only question is whether or not we will accept the deal.\n\nThe Emperor's men drive a hard bargain: since the end of the Second World War, Russian-brewed vodka has been in short supply in the West. Indeed, the very first shipment received will probably pay itself back several times over. Collaboration with one of the only vestiges of monarchism in Russia would also serve to ingratiate ourselves with White émigrés, many of whom sit upon large piles of cash. The opportunities that trade with Vyatka could present to us are numerous, but so are the risks.\n\nBesides the resources that will be needed to establish the route, our greatest problem will be getting the vodka across Europe in the first place - a treacherous journey through German-occupied territory and the banditry that plagues Russia. Even as few as a dozen crates being lost per month could substantially cut into our profits. There is also the issue of the general instability of Russia as a whole. Vyatka could easily cease to exist in half a decade, and our relations with them would hardly endear us to whoever takes their place.\n\nWith all of this in mind, should we accept the Emperor's offer with a handshake, or politely turn it down and search for better opportunities? Our men in Kostroma are eagerly awaiting a response."

Already the first convoy of Vyatkan vodka has been transferred to Breton control, and it will soon begin its long journey to Brittany. Once there it will be prepared for export and sold by the Bretons to whomever is willing to buy.\n\nThe Bretons have promised the first payment in a month's time, and already the Tsar's advisors are determining both the best way to invest the proceeds as well as methods to improve production should demand prove high enough.\n\nBefore long, the entire world will have heard of our Principality, and the quality of our product will ensure that they think of it fondly."

Our agents in Kostroma have reported back that their mutually beneficial offer has been politely turned down even after substantial concessions were made on our part. Cited were the risks of transporting the vodka across Europe and our "questionable ability to meet demand." This is a grave mistake on Brittany's part, of course, but it seems that they have made up their mind.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that our distillery will have to remain focused on domestic production. Overall this has been a major blow to our efforts to obtain foreign currency, and for the foreseeable future it seems we will have to continue relying on that which we receive from émigrés abroad.\n\nNonetheless our distillery is still proving to be a worthwhile investment, and all hope is not lost for trading our vodka abroad. Several of our closer neighbors could still prove to be interested in acquiring more alcoholic beverages, and as our power grows we could easily end up doing ourselves what we have had to rely on the Bretons for at present."

Enemies of the state could be shown no mercy, lest disorder spread.\n\nThey had been turned onto the men following one of many raids on suspected communist safehouses, where a coded letter had, after being deciphered, led them to a warehouse. There the men had been found, suspected of aiming to subvert the Tsar's regime on orders from Arkhangelsk. Like all committed  'revolutionaries,' the men had resisted. But the agents knew their task, and knew that everyone, eventually, breaks.

The Tsar had made it clear that he wanted to deal with the myriad internal issues facing the Sovereignty before any talk of further unification would be countenanced, and political jockeying had already begun.\n\nAs the Tsar arrived and the meeting commenced, one member proposed to focus state efforts on infrastructure, while another wished to focus on internal security, and others wanted attentions placed elsewhere besides. By the time the meeting finished, several hours later, some progress, less than was hoped but more than was feared, had been made on several of those issues.\n\nLater that evening, Vladimir thought on the events of earlier. There were differing opinions, and arguments, and debates of all kinds in between.

I have heard, as you have, the calls for democracy increase day-by-day, and I do not believe that modern Russia can endure the rigid autocracy of my ancestors."\n\nGul, the eternal reformer, spoke first.

But-"\n\n"When will it happen?" Solzhenitsyn interrupted, his own eyes narrowing.\n\n"As soon as we are secure." Vladimir gestured above himself. "With the end of the bombing raids the generals have told me that it is imperative we move quickly to secure the region, before others do the same. As soon as that is achieved, the congress will be called." There was more said, but the most important message had been conveyed.\n\nAs the three men left the room, Shulgin hesitated before closing the door behind himself, and spoke.

He had a duty to his people and to Russia, and those simply could not be abandoned, no matter how much he sometimes wanted to leave and return to Brittany or somewhere farther afield.\n\nHe was the Tsar, and he had his duty.\n\nWhich, for now at least, involved rousing from bed and preparing for the day."

Pulling up to the gate, the driver would smile at the guards and, when handing over his identification and manifest, would also include an envelope.\n\nThe guards would then inspect the papers and manifest and return them, the envelope having somehow disappeared. They would then open the gate, and the truck would drive through, it being trusted that the goods on the manifest were in fact the goods in the truck.\n\nYes, being a border guard meant consigning oneself to low pay and mind-numbing periods of inactivity.

Berezniki, a frontier territory surrounded by radicals, was eventually pacified by Kazembek and his followers, and despite all likelihoods to the contrary the territory, now a viceroyalty of the Mladorossi, has both survived and thrived.\n\nIndeed, reports from the Tsar's representative, Boris Skosyrev, have described both significant industrial developments as well as the sustainable exploitation of local natural resources. These resources, including critical oil and petroleum products, are regularly dispatched back to the Principality, under the careful political supervision of Kazembek himself. Thus, he is crucial both to maintaining peace in and delivering resources from the region, and as long as he does that, carefully supervised by Skosyrev, he will maintain his position.\n\nDespite this, however, suspicion from members of our government towards Kazembek continues, and many say that his resource deliveries will continue only until he sees an opportunity to fully divorce himself from the Tsar's authority.

And that day had now come. The Okhrana's report, and warning, on Kazembek's imminent display of disloyalty had arrived by special messenger less than an hour ago. Far too late to do any good. But just long enough to allow him to burn everything of value.\n\nHe signed. Kazembek had never been an agreeable choice as governor. His belief in the syncretism of monarchist ideals with communist influences was not only laughable, but also a starting point from which today's ending was inevitable. He just hoped that the Tsar would be able to reclaim the rogue territory before the religious fanatics to the north or the ideological fanatics to the south moved to claim it.\n\nTurning away from the soldiers, Skosyrev tossed one last document into the fire beside him, hefted his pack, and checked the rifle by the door. He might not have wanted to see this day, but he had planned for it. A route through the forest had been scouted, and a boat by the river concealed. If he was lucky, he would reach the border with Vyatka shortly, and if he was luckier, he would be permitted to accompany the army on its return to Berezniki.\n\nSkosyrev smiled at the thought.

Arriving later, Valentin understood similarly quickly.\n\nThe existence of a revolutionary cell, dedicated to the overthrow of the Tsar, had recently been discovered. The dead man, an official from the Ministry of Finance, had had his name flagged in connection to it, and having been assigned to the task force looking into the cell, they both knew, immediately, that there had to be a connection.

That, at least, proved simple.\n\nThe man had been shot from behind in the kitchen by, judging from the wound, a small caliber pistol. The casing was bagged and would be examined to determine the type and origin of the gun. The next step was to look for evidence that might connect the man to the cell, in order to trove the suspicions of him that had arisen before his death.\n\nThis was similarly found in a box of letters. Amongst the many sent to the man from family and friends, one stood out. Sent by "Kachestvennaya Dostavka," an import/export company that operated throughout Western Russia, it indicated that the man had been involved in moving unspecified cargo for them in and out of the industrial city of Izhevsk.\n\nAnother such letter indicated that he had recently facilitated the purchase of a small warehouse for the company here Vyatka itself, and had specifically ensured that it was in a lesser-traveled part of the city.

Amongst the many mundane manifests, a series of shipments between the Kachestvennaya Dostavka warehouse and locations in Izhvesk were found, all facilitated by the same man - Koronovanny Byrukho.\n\nAlthough the agents suspected the name to false, after noticing it in several other documents they retreated to the Okhrana offices to pour through official records.

Either the man was an extreme ascetic or, more likely, this was a safe house.\n\nLeveraging their training and experience, they began searching the house for clues, physical or otherwise, and it did not take long before they found a well-concealed false floor panel. Underneath, a ladder descended into a crudely excavated cellar, and inside they found what they had come for.\n\nOn a desk covered in maps and folders, one in particular stood out. Stamped 'Confidential - Plan Eagle,' the papers inside the folder seemed to describe an upcoming sabotage operation against an industrial plant in Izhevsk, using materials shipped from the warehouse they had investigated earlier.

Other Ministry agents were gently interviewed, companies he had worked with were contacted, and offices he had worked in searched, all to no success.\n\nHowever, there remained several specific factories that had been identified in his letters, and which could still be explored.

Running against the crowds of workers, and towards the site of the explosion, Yevgeny spotted a figure standing nearby.

Joining one of the teams themselves, the agents found themselves watching one such factory, the primary target listed in the plan discovered in Vyatka.\n\nWith long-developed and well-practiced skills of surveillance, it was not long before Yevgeny first saw the figure first approaching, and then entering, the factory. Moving quickly, Yevgeny, Valentin, and the support team followed. As Yevgeny approached the figure, he realized that it was attaching a device to one of the factory's fuel tanks, and drew his sidearm while calling out a challenge. The figure immediately took off running.\n\nAs Yevgeny and Valentin began to give chase, the local agents moved to take care of the device, and Yevgeny gave thanks that the agents had been there to assist.

The man was young, probably not out of his twenties, and clearly very physically fit besides.

Unfortunately however, and although he pushed his body to the limit, the saboteur continued to pull ahead.\n\nAs they approached the exit to the factory grounds, the saboteur grew even more distant. Yevgeny realized he had a clear shot and, knowing that it was preferable to eliminate an enemy agent if escape could not be prevented, slowed to better his aim, firing three times a moment later.\n\nOne shot found its mark, striking the saboteur in the shoulder, but before he could fire again the figure, after several stumbling steps, disappeared into shadow. Yevgeny cursed as Valentin stopped beside him, equally angry.\n\nBoth agents knew that they would mobilize the city's officers to try and find the saboteur, and both knew it was unlikely to lead to an arrest. Already the saboteur would be executing an escape plan, and within hours would be deep in the Russian forests, if not in the territory of another power altogether.\n\nYevgeny and Valentin looked at each other, sharing a grimace.

How they had detected the saboteur. And then how, unforgivably, they had allowed that saboteur to escape, robbing the Okhrana of the opportunity to interrogate them and discover other members of the cell. They were dismissed soon after\n\nIt took several days before the decision was actually made, but all knew what it would be. The services of Yevgeny and Valentin would no longer be needed. They had proven themselves unable to protect the Tsar and his nation, and the Okhrana did not tolerate failures in its ranks.\n\nNow civilians, the agents would need to find a new purpose in life.

A major attack, an attempt by a foreign-sponsored, anti-government cell to destabilize the Tsar's country had been detected and defeated. But the saboteur had escaped, and with them went any chance the Okhrana had of further penetrating, and thus defeating the cell itself. The Okhrana was not known for being kind to those who did not complete their missions to the fullest, a classification Yevgeny and Valentin found now applied to them.\n\nThey would not, despite their achievements, be acknowledged as respected defenders of the nation. No, they would be reassigned to desk jobs in a regional office, far away from capital or any investigations of importance.\n\nThey would still serve the Tsar, of course, but in a manner more befitting of their 'skills.'"

That was a mistake.\n\nAs he ran, Yevgeny heard, in his mind, the voice of Smyslovsky cursing out another agent for doing the same thing. Trying to do so only slowed you down, he would say, and often did little to hinder pursuit. As such, and despite the obvious difference in physicality, he found himself gaining on the saboteur. He realized he had a clear shot, if he had wanted it.\n\nBut he, they, needed the man alive. He was their connection, their next link in the cell's chain. He could not be allowed to get away. And, as they approached an exit to the factory's grounds, Yevgeny saw that he would not. Suddenly appearing in front of him through herculean effort, Valentin barreled into the saboteur, knocking him flat and pinning him onto the ground.\n\nAs Yevgeny rushed forward and  pressed his pistol to the saboteur's head, Valentin prepared restraints.

But what was to the public an accident was a far more serious affair to the Okhrana.\n\nThe successful capture, and subsequent interrogation, of the saboteur allowed the Izhvesk Case, as it became known, to become the foundation by which the Okhrana moved against the revolutionary cell that had been identified some time previously. As a an agent of the cell, now known to be comprised of both infiltrators from the Revolutionary Front along with local communist and socialist dissidents, he was able to offer insight into its activities as well as identifying information about his direct contacts.\n\nAs a result of their quick actions in Izhvesk, Yevgeny and Valentin, together with many other loyal agents, were able to, in short order, make a number of additional arrests and work their way further up the chain. Before long, the ability of the cell to conduct operations was crippled, and though several members of it escaped, its ability to act as a serious threat to the Tsar's regime was destroyed.\n\nThus, despite the failure to halt the attack in Izhvesk, the Okhrana saw the overall result as a victory for themselves, for the Tsar, and for the integrity of monarchism as an institution."

Perhaps that was what the enemies of Emperor Vladimir thought of when first setting up the spy ring aimed at overthrowing him. Whether they enjoyed popular support was doubtful, and as such, they likely had to resort to more extreme solutions, namely sabotage and terrorism, with no real hope of taking power for themselves. Unfortunately for them, the nation they were in had the Okhrana.\n\nWhen it came to fighting threats to the government they served, the secret police had no reservations, and it showed no kindness. This was the case in the Izhevsk Operation as well. The instant the bombing in Izhevsk was foiled, the brave agents Valentin Markov and Yevgeny Nesterov were called upon by the government itself to combat the threat the extremist group that had attempted the attack presented. With the leads from the investigation of the government official, and the clues from the saboteur, taking down the entire spy ring was only a matter of time.\n\nOne connection led to the other, and soon dozens of arrests in the name of state security were ordered. It did not take long until the entirety of the group, from its origins to its exact plans, had been discovered. Thus, the case closed, and the Okhrana continued normal business. As for the two agents that had spearheaded the entire operation, they became heroes of the nation, not in public, but in the government and the intelligence of Vyatka. Soon, entire departments of the Okhrana would be headed by them, as they gained more experience and more power, which they had decided to devote to His Imperial Majesty."

Thus, becoming both skilled at wetwork, whatever it may be, and even better at keeping the confidence of just what was done was the primary method of acquiring the capital needed for internal advancement. This was a system that Yevgeny and Valentin did use, and had used, to great effect in their careers.\n\nSometimes the tasks were simple. Intercepting communications, raiding suspected safe-houses, interrogating denounced dissidents, and the like. Sometimes they were not. Sometimes men had to be found, run to ground, and delivered to their superiors, whatever the collateral damage to the families or friends of their quarry. Almost to a one, those men were never seen again.\n\nYes, the Okhrana valued efficiency, and Yevgeny and Valentin had mastered the art of being so, through training, practice, and long hours of actual work. What else could one call the feat of securing the critical lead in an offensive against a foreign-sponsored insurrectionist cell?\n\nWith every task completed, with every enemy neutralized, Yevgeny and Valentin advanced just that much higher in the Okhrana's hierarchy, their ultimate aim to serve and protect the Tsar, no matter the cost or consequences."

In twenty minutes, the sun would set, work would cease, and the Sabbath would begin.\n\nStriking a match, me moved to light them, the warmth in his hands reminding him of his wife and family, as well as feelings about them that he had thought long forgotten. As the candles took the light, and as the sun began to set, shadows began to dance around the room. The two points of light in front of him became blazing towers, calling him to prayer before the eyes of the Lord - and before the day of rest began.\n\n"Blessed are You, Lord our God," he began, drawing his breath deep and closing his eyes, "King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to light the Shabbat candles."\n\nThe Sabbath had begun, but Yakov did not open his eyes.

They would insult him, block his way, and most generally act in whichever fashion caused him the most trouble. But today was to be much different. Much worse.\n\nAs they moved to surround him, he moved to walk away, but for the first time one of them grabbed his shoulder. Tightly. By the time he let go, Yakov was surrounded. And then the insults began, and Yakov grew scared. This time, they not only came faster but were also more screamed than spoken.\n\nOne of the men, a well-known scion of an uptown family that was close to the Tsar, withdrew a strip of bacon from his pocket and offered it to Yakov, only to watch him shake his head in reply.\n\nAnother of the thugs laughed. "Boris," he began, speaking to the scion, "I think the dirty Jew doesn't value your generosity." Before Yakov could speak, could try to deny the man's words, Boris had pulled a club from his belt and swung. As Yakov fell to the ground, clutching his head in pain, the rest of the men withdrew their own clubs and began swinging as well.\n\nWhen they had finished, and begun searching his body for gold, rubles, or other valuables, Yakov was unconscious. Those on the street did not intervene, scared of the influence of Boris' family.\n\nBut from a discrete corner, however, a camera captured the scene and the faces of the perpetrators.

The connection between the young man's father and himself was being spoken about more and more, and Vladimir knew he had to take action, and quickly. When he said as much, the young man's eyes went wide.\n\n"Sire," he began, voice trembling, "I know I have caused you both injury and concern. But I beg you to grant mercy. If not for my sake, then for my father's, who fought with you all the way from Brittany to your palace here." He swung an arm towards the window. "Our family has always been supportive of the crown, and if you grant mercy I pledge that my father, and I after him, will always be indebted to you, regardless of need. Please, majesty, do not let the matter of one Jew undo all that we have done for you."\n\nVladimir considered his words for a long moment. He had to show contrition for the injured man, of course. But Mozhayev's family was influential, and to make enemies of them, after so many years of loyalty, could inspire others to ask if their own long loyalties would be similarly treated so poorly. After a moment, he spoke.\n\n"Fine. I will be merciful. This time. It will not happen again. And now you may leave. We are busy." Falling over himself with gratitude, Mozhayev rapidly retreated as the Tsar called for a secretary to compose a letter to the injured man.\n\nHe hoped it would be enough."

A knock on the door a moment later refocused his attention, and he called the visitor to enter.Roman Gul, the leader of the reformists, stepped inside a moment later.\n\n"Yes?" the Tsar asked, unable to hide the exhaustion from his voice. Does the Council need something?"\n\nGul shook his head. "No, sire, not currently." He smiled and spread his hands. "They just asked me to check on you. We all know how difficult this is." A flash of embarrassment crossed the minister's face. "I wanted to say that we are all confident you did the best you could in an unexpected situation. In the Russia I remember from childhood, nobody would have even considered protesting for the rights of a Jew."\n\n"Times are different now," the Tsar replied sharply. "Clearly."\n\nGul nodded. "Yes, sire, they are. And for the better, I would say. Even if things could have perhaps been handled better at the start, I, we, know that you will do the right thing."\n\nGul opened the door again and, with a quick bow, stepped outside, leaving the Tsar with his thoughts, the sounds of the crowd outside, and his migraine.

He has claimed, however, that such assistance was not wholly voluntary on his part. Documents obtained by the Tribune make it clear that such claims are false.\n\nCopies of messages passed between the Tsar and German representatives in Brittany, the Tsar's former residence during his years of exile, detail the story of an ambitious monarch willing to compromise both his ideals and the security of his country in the pursuit of personal power.\n\nDocuments have been reprinted in their entirety within...\n\n(continued on page 2)"

Some of the functionaries began to move about. "And then," he continued, "schedule interviews with their primary competitors. We need to get our side of the story out."\n\nTo the staff arrayed around him, Gul projected confidence. But inside his own mind, he knew there would be no victory here. The allegations were out, their damage already done. And further claims were already being made.\n\nThe Tribune, along with many other anti-governmental publications that had coalesced around it, had begun publishing stories about the Tsar's family. About other aspects of his character. About Gul himself, once he was thrust into the maelstrom.\n\nHe knew that, eventually, he would be able to stop the flow of negative press. Every newspaper required access to the government to function as anything other than a seditious newsletter, and the Tribune was no exception. They would learn that in short order.

Then it was his history in Brittany. And then it was his response to those events themselves! If it had not been for the loyal service of Roman Gul, Vladimir did not think he would have made it through. But the councillor had shown his dedication, and given him good advice, besides. Advice that now rested on his desk.\n\nHe had written a personal letter to Yakov Rivkin. He had spoken of his failures, of his regrets, and he had humbly offered compensation while asking the man for forgiveness. It would get out and be reprinted, of course, and he would be again hounded for his attempts at mitigation. His attempts at concealment. But still, the Tsar knew in his heart that sending it was the right thing to do.

For all the Jews in our Empire, we shall denounce the hatred that has, for so long, harmed their livelihood and survival.\n\nOur trusted advisor, Roman Gul, had implored us since the beginning to do the 'right thing.' A nebulous concept for a monarch, who must not dwell in the morals of their actions, indeed.\n\nHowever, I dedicate this last paragraph to you, not as your Tsar, but as one person to another. I do not know if you will find this letter sufficient, but if you will allow me the opportunity to redeem my past actions I promise, in the presence of the God we both venerate in different ways, that I will try.\n\nSigned, Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov."

He had kept faith with God for so many years, and God had kept faith with him in return. Though he would have liked to remain.\n\nThe callous, curt letter that the Tsar had sent came to mind.

He was a soldier, yes, but he was also a Russian.\n\nWhen word reached him of Tsar Vladimir's return, and the establishment of a monarchist state in Russia dedicated to fighting communists and fascists alike, he realized, eventually, that he had to return to the land of his birth, find his Tsar, and serve him in one last war.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, he would die as he had lived: fighting."

 vyatkaexp.1.t:0 "An Offer from the Tsar"
 vyatkaexp.1.desc:0 "For many years Alexander Kazembek and Tsar Vladimir III of Vyatka were political allies. Indeed, it was the Tsar who appointed Kazembek as governor of Berezniki and permitted him to continue to grow the Mladorossi movement there.\n\nAlthough relations broke down some time ago, and Kazembek separated us from the central government in Vyatka, it would appear that the Tsar is determined for his authority to return to Berezniki, one way or another.\n\nWhile we are willing to fight, the Tsar's army is much larger and better equipped than our own, and so the offer for Kazembek and the Tsar to meet and discuss terms was a welcome one. If we can extract concessions and protections from the Tsar, even as we agree to rejoin his state, we can continue to spread our beliefs in peace and security.\n\nMany senior figures in the movement have expressed support for the talks, and the only thing remaining is to see if Kazembek, whose voice carries more weight than all others combined, agrees as well."

 vyatkaexp.2.t:0 "The Mladorossi Fold"
 vyatkaexp.2.desc:0 "Although the meeting between Kazembek and the Tsar was tense, a successful agreement was eventually reached. Though the terms reached were not wholly satisfactory to either party, they were enough to establish acceptance.\n\nKazembek has agreed that he and his Mladorossi will return Berezniki to state control, allow us to appoint central administrators to oversee the territory, and will remove themselves from its current government.\n\nIn return, the Tsar will grant amnesty to the movement's members, guarantee equal political participation by the movement in any future elections, without harassment or impediment by state organs and, most important, relax restrictions on the formation and operation of labor unions within state territory.\n\nThough not all are happy with the Tsar's concessions, most agree that a bloodless solution to the situation is far superior to its alternative, and none can argue with the resumption of resource collection from the governorate."

No terms were reached, and it now appears that war is all but inevitable.\n\nThe Tsar made it clear, following a military conference soon after his return, that he now formally considers Berezniki a state attempting secession, and has instructed that the government make all efforts to return it to central control as soon as possible.\n\nMilitary units are already on the move towards Berezniki, and before long it is expected that they will meet Mladorossi militias.

 vyatkaexp.4.desc:0 ""Alexander Lvovich Kazembek," the judge began, "you have been found guilty of insurrection, abuse of authority, treason..." The judge continued, his words ending a trial whose outcome had never been in doubt.\n\nSitting across the courtroom, Kazembek listened in silence. He knew that his actions had been right, regardless of where he now found himself. The people of his country needed emancipation from the regimes they found themselves crushed by, and that emancipation would not come at the hands of a Tsar, just as it would not come at the hands of a communist. It would come from what he had strived for: something in between. Unfortunately, Russia was simply not yet ready to hear it.\n\nAs the judge proclaimed his sentence - lifetime imprisonment - Kazembek held his head high. He knew he was right. He knew he always had been, and that he always would be. And one day, when the unmoderated tyranny of the Tsar was ended by the acts of more successful men such as he, he knew would walk to freedom, vindicated by all.\n\nWhen the guards escorted Kazembek, still defiant, out of the room and towards the waiting transport, all eyes were upon him. Nobody noticed the frowning man in the corner, disappointment written on his face. Boris Skosyrev had hoped to see Kazembek hang, but he accepted that he would have to be content with the outcome nonetheless."

He was a caring figure, but that care was tempered with the detachment necessary of a man who had to make momentous decisions. And he was no ardent supporter of the monarchy. At least not yet.\n\nAs talks continued, the real question was soon asked - what would the Tsar have to do to ensure the peaceful integration of the Order into his realm? Antipin replied immediately, clearly having prepared a response long in advance.\n\nTo the south, in and around Perm, lay the lands of the Aryan 'Brotherhood,' a fanatic and clearly insane sect, and one that had long troubled both the Tsar and those protected by the Order. If the Tsar wanted to prove his piety to both God and the Order, if he wanted to prove his dedication to the common people of Russia, he would have to exterminate this abomination, root and stem.\n\nTsar Vladimir carefully considered Antipin's words.

How else could he have made the choice to invade the lands of the Order, sack the Fortress-Monastery, and kill so many of Daniil's fellow monks?\n\nDanill had spent most of his young life in the order, believing absolutely in its holy mission to protect the weak and downtrodden from the jackals that surrounded them. But he had failed. They had failed. And now when he spoke to God, he didn't hear anything in response except the screams of his brothers as the soldiers shot them down.\n\nBut he was still alive, and he would avenge them. It was a long way to Vyatka, through hard terrain and even harder soldiers. But he would make it. He knew he would. He shifted as he felt the rifle dig into his side. It was in Vyatka that the false Tsar made his home, and though Daniil knew he would die, he also knew he had a duty to protect millions of other Russians from the honeyed words and false promises of this hateful Romanov.\n\nHe only needed one shot."

The envoy, attempting to arrange a meeting between the Order's Grandmaster Antipin and Tsar Vladimir, was informed that no such meeting would be possible.\n\nThe actions of the Tsar's government, with regards to the reintegration of the Mladorossi movement's adherents in Berezniki, appears to have greatly upset the order, who are militantly opposed to communism in any form. The Tsar's concessions to the movement regarding labor unions seems to have triggered particular outrage besides.\n\nWhile we have attempted to explain the position of our government on the matter, the Order has indicated they are not interested in further communication. Foreign relations between our states are now non-existent, and it would appear that the only way we will secure the lands around Gayny will be through war."

A tattered flag bearing the hooked cross and weighted tricolour of the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nFurious that such an icon of blasphemy had been brought to his lands, the Grandmaster only paused when the officer smiled wide. "You don't understand, Grandmaster," he said, eyes twinkling, "this was the first flag of the Brotherhood. Taken from their 'Fyurer's' personal quarters. They're defeated."\n\nAs quick as his rage had formed, it had subsided, and Antipin quickly snatched the flag and tossed into a nearby fire. As it burned, he gave thanks to God that the jackals had been defeated by one so righteous as Tsar Vladimir, and he gave the officer the response he knew the man wanted.\n\nThe Tsar had proven himself worthy, and so the Order of Saint George would join him, for the good of all Russia."

Sleep was a luxury. Food a boon. A day without beatings nonexistent. On this particular day, however, there were far fewer guards than usual, and Vadim wondered if it had anything to do with the explosions in the distance. Explosions that had been getting closer every day.\n\nSome time later, Vadim realized with a start that the guards, all of them, were gone. The gate was left open. And, as he looked at it, a man in a uniform he had never seen before stepped through. More followed behind, and began spreading through the complex. Stunned, overwhelmed, Vadim stood still, frozen in place. Until, from the highest tower, the one the guards used as a sniper's nest, the flag bearing the hated swastika was cut down, and the tricolour of the Imperial state was unfurled.\n\nVadim fell to his knees, his muscles suddenly weak, and tears streamed down his face.

Large numbers of practicing Muslims now live in our lands, and as an ostensibly Orthodox Christian nation, we must decide what to do with them.\n\nAs usual, Roman Gul's Kadets have suggested that the Tsar's government adopt a policy of complete and total religious freedom for all subjects.\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Solidarists, being founded on the principles of Christian solidarism, argues for a moderate approach, with religious freedom permitted, but with an official acknowledgement of the historical importance of the Orthodox Church, combined with school programs including such in their curricula.\n\nVasily Shulgin's Conservatives, counting many devout Orthodox faithful as well as those holding antisemitic opinions amongst their number, supports enshrining Orthodox Christianaity as the state religion and encouraging minorities to convert.\n\nSo far the Tsar has refused comment. But a decision will need to be made, and soon."

Gunshots in battle were rapid and infrequent. Gunshots applied in execution were slow and regular. These were the latter.\n\nSyktyvkar was supposed to have been pacified weeks ago, after orders had come from the government to leave responsibility for the city, apart from the area immediately around Mikhail's military garrison, to local collaborators in the so-called 'Royalist Guard of Syktyvkar.' But still the gunshots continued. Gathering a small party of soldiers, he moved towards the sounds, and as he grew closer his heart began to sink. The gunshots were being joined by screams.\n\nAs he finally reached the origin of the noise, he knew immediately what it was - a cleansing. A party of the Royalist Guard had rounded up a group of citizens and, after short 'interrogations,' executing them.\n\nStorming forward, he demanded a stop to the shootings, and further demanded to know what was going on. The commander just smiled and showed him a pass signed by the city's military governor. The captives were socialists, he said, members and saboteurs of the Revolutionary Front, and he was simply taking care of them.\n\nMikhail could see he had no power here. Were the captives truly socialists? Truly saboteurs? Or were they simply political enemies from the old Republic? Or personal enemies? An order to return to base came over his radio, and with one last look at the terrified captives, he obeyed.\n\nMikhail had once thought that using collaborators meant there would be less bloodshed. He did not want to speak to another one ever again."

It was being suggested by some that, owing both to their competence and their absolute opposition to communism, they could potentially be recruited into the Imperial Army. The Tsar knew that there were personal reasons for the suggestion as well - after all, many of the captured officers had once served alongside his own during the West Russian War - but there was genuine merit. Many of the generals were truly very skilled.\n\nThe suggestion was fiercely protested by other generals. Unlike both they and the Tsar himself, the men had not abandoned collaboration with the Germans until forced to do so, and they had generally fascist leanings besides. Vladimir faced a dilemma. Would he ignore the past of the ROA generals in the interests of pragmatism? Or would he conclude the cost was not worth the reward?\n\nHe had to decide."

The man was a very capable politician and administrator. And in the government he could both preach Mladorossi-influenced solutions to national problems and also identify sympathetic politicians and officials.\n\nMany officials are, unsurprisingly, critical of the suggestion to give a senior government position to one that they see as both a radical and a traitor, while others see it as a necessary concession towards the state's unification plans for Western Russia. Kazembek is no fool, and if this concession is granted prior to the Tsar's meeting with him, he will not accept a cabinet post without significant influence.\n\nThus, the central question has become whether we will accept the leader of the Mladorossi as an influential figure of our government in exchange for a decisive end to the crisis surrounding his rogue governorate."

The evidence against them, from witnesses and otherwise, was damning, and was supported to great effect using documents, carefully organized and reviewed by the Okhrana, from the archives in Samara.\n\nSeveral of the revolutionaries, long used to bombastic speeches, spoke for hours at length about their own accomplishments, the Tsar's failings, the lack of authority of the court, and many other things besides. But the outcome was never in doubt. It could not be.\n\nAs the sentences were read out, the revolutionaries looked on, stone-faced. They had sent thousands to their deaths after similar trials, and they knew what was coming. Death, for most. Lifetime imprisonment, for some. Long sentences, for a few, to allay allegations of forced harshness. They had spent their life in opposition to the concept of the Imperial state, and now it was finally punishing them.\n\nAll over Russia, both inside the Tsar's domain and without anti-communists rejoiced.

It was thus the perfect unit for him to visit.\n\nEscorted by both bodyguards and senior officers, Vladimir arrived at the battalion's camp in the early afternoon, beginning with a tour of its fortifications and general construction. Following that, he took the time to meet with the soldiers nominated for awards, and taking over responsibility from the unit commander, personally conveyed the awards to those so nominated, with pictures taken all the while.\n\nBy the time he left, later that evening, many of the battalions soldiers seemed more confident, more focused, and more determined to complete their mission.\n\nThe visit was considered a great success, not only among the troops themselves, but also in how the public began to see their Tsar - as a man willing to leave his palace and meet those actually fighting for him, in stark contrast to many of the Romanovs of old."

The territory and its valuable resources needed to be brought back under state control, but the way in which to do so was causing debate. The syncretic ideology of monarchism and socialism that its rogue governor, Alexander Kazembek, professed was anathema to the military, and nearly to a man they advised their Tsar to give the order to prepare and execute an invasion.\n\nOther, more moderate members of government believed that those same monarchist beliefs of Kazembek could be appealed to in order to negotiate peaceful re-acquisition of the territory. They did concede, however, that some concessions would be required in order to do so.\n\nIn the end, as in nearly all things, the final decision was made by the Tsar."

Internal security has been achieved, through the efforts of military and security services in combating bandits, partisans, and revolutionaries of all kinds. And as a result, Russians within Imperial borders are feeling something they have not felt for a very long time: hope.\n\nThe Soverenity moves forward into an age where a functional and united Russian Empire is within its grasp.

However, at the Tsar's direction, the Imperial Recovery Committee has drafted a comprehensive plan of construction and reform.\n\nThey pledge to focus on the repair and construction of domestic industry, the reestablishment of a competent academic base, and the introduction of significant currency and financial reforms. Direct foreign investment will also be vigorously pursued.\n\nThough it will be very difficult, and require hard decisions to be made, the experts of the Committee are confident that, if the course is stayed, their plan will succeed. They further state that such success will not only serve the millions of Russians crying out for prosperity, but also provide the economic base needed to reasonably pursue further unification efforts.

We must decide, decisively, upon a unifying doctrine for our formations. We must build public trust and support. We must establish support units. We must expand production, train new officers, and update our equipment besides.\n\nClearly, there is much to do. But we are determined and dedicated, and will address each issue in turn. Though painful examinations and admittances will have to be made, with each will come improvement, and when we reach the end of this long path we can be confident in our ability to carry the Tsar's banner all the way to the Far East."

The Corps will act, domestically and otherwise, to improve both the image and the connections of the Sovereignty to any who are amenable to either. They will also, however and of course, focus their efforts when needed on specific goals, regions, or nations that are provided to them, and some such focuses of attention are under consideration.\n\nShould their competence, and our international position, develop sufficiently, it may even be possible to open dialogue with the other regimes occupying Russian territory to the east.

Industrial expertise, military equipment, and connections further afield are all potential outcomes of such trade, and all would be useful to our new and growing nation.\n\nWe should, however, remain vigilant.

Advice from the State Department as to a potential response is mixed.\n\nMany support the proposal, citing the reasonably palatable nature of the regime, especially compared to other possibilities. They also identify valuable resources that could be exchanged for American expertise and developmental assistance, as well as the fundamental benefit of carrying the message of the OFN, that of the free determination of peoples, forward.\n\nOthers claim that granting the Sovereignty's government recognition would be premature at this stage, as well as potentially causing diplomatic friction with Germany at a time when tensions are already high.

They have also identified a potential lack of desire on the Americans' part for additional diplomatic tension with Germany, which a recognition of ourselves would certainly provoke.\n\nRegardless of the cause, however, the fact of their refusal remains.

Though they may, in most cases, not hold the direct authority that our Tsar does, they are still monarchs, and among all monarchs there is a common bond.\n\nConsequently, efforts in this direction will begin.

And, you know, if you could help smooth over any lingering feelings from others, I would be most appreciative..."\n\nSerrano's eyes left the road for a moment as he quickly inspected the thickly-wrapped roll of money that Skosyrev had removed from his pocket. "Are you trying to bribe me, Skosyrev?" he chuckled. "Nobody remembers Andorra - I just haven't driven in some time. And if that was your intention, you should have thought harder on it.

He would be touring many of the region's cities over the next few days, showing the people that their monarch had arrived to return them to the legitimate Russian government.\n\n"Good evening, people of the Empire," Solzhenitsyn began, "I speak to you tonight of victory in many forms. I speak to you first of military victory, as the last remnants of the enemy state have surrendered to the officers of our brave Imperial Army. I speak to you of economic victory, as production levels of consumer goods have reached their highest-ever recorded levels.

Real power, like the Romanovs of old. But ever since the conclusion of the Vologda Congress, that power had been taken away from him, piece by piece.\n\nThe Solidarists had triumphed, their message of national strength and reclamation resonating with the - his - people, and Solzhenitsyn had quickly moved to consolidate his government's power, both within the constitution and outside it.\n\n'Temporary' laws were passed in his name, and 'national security' initiatives restricted the rights of millions of Russians. And there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nOh, he gave speeches, visited factories, and presided over the now-defanged Council. But the speeches were delivered to him, the tours were guided, and the Council packed with Solidarist sympathizers. He knew that his ancestors would never have allowed such to happen.

A combination of propaganda efforts and a national re-education campaign, along with a coordinated offensive between the Okhrana, ordinary police, and military forces, will be put into action.

Interrogation of these individuals, in turn, provides additional intelligence on others, and as such the pace of our efforts are accelerating.\n\nHowever, we must also report that efforts to secure local support through the use of targeted informational campaigns have proven less successful, and can likely be attributed to anti-monarchist sentiment reinforced by previous regimes. We do believe, however and despite the cost, that continuing them, until such time as they are effective, is a worthy investment.

To do what was necessary to prepare it for the no-doubt terrible hardships and conflicts ahead. If they had known what he really thought, however, he doubted they would idolize him so.\n\nHe was well aware of his own, and his movement's, mortality. Fundamentally authoritarian, he knew that the history books of generations to come were unlikely to be kind to him. But that was a price he was willing to pay.

Still, Roman had assumed as the head of one of the three main parties of the Empire, he would retain some influence in the halls of government. He had prepared himself for negotiations, advancing the Kadet's agenda through compromise and dealmaking and, if it came to it, a healthy amount of obstruction. How foolish he'd been!\n\nWhen he received his new assignment he'd been outraged. He was the head of a major party, one of Russia's loudest voices for freedom and democracy. Surely they didn't think he'd accept being reassigned to a token task force far from the centers of power. But it turned out they thought exactly that, and when faced with the choice of mandatory retirement or accepting, he'd packed his bags, swallowed his pride, and made his way to Syktyvkar.\n\nHe was not the only victim of "the reshuffling" as he called it. It was impossible to get a full count but he'd heard from dozens of contacts, now scattered across central Russia. A few of them had even wound up working alongside him.

It wasn't that he was uncomfortable around people of other cultures. He was an Udmurt who had decided to settle among the Bashkirs in Ufa. If anyone was comfortable living as a minority, it was him. No, what made Ven uncomfortable was the rate at which the Russians were coming to Bashkiria. He had always scoffed at the theories his more political friends told him about Russian conspiracies, dismissing them as paranoia and cultural insecurity, but now some of them were starting to seem more plausible. There was no way to prove it, but he couldn't believe that thousands of Russians would simultaneously decide to settle in a non-russian region of the empire. Sure, Ufa had been growing steadily even before reunification, but not enough to attract this much attention on its own. It couldn't be a coincidence that the city government was up for election next year, around the time the Russian population of the city would surpass the Bashkirs if current trends held. Ven expected they would.\n\nHe looked at the letter sitting on his desk. It was from his sister in Izhevsk, the unofficial capital of the Udmert people. It had been over two decades since he'd left Udmurtia, and in that time he had only returned to the region three times, once for a wedding and twice for funerals. He did not look like the Bashkirs or pray to the same god as most of them, but they had welcomed him with open arms. In Ufa it didn't matter if you were a Bashkir, an Udmurt, a Tatar or a Turk. All these groups and dozens more had lived in the Russian's shadow for so long, they were happy to share the sunlight. Now the Russians were back, for better or for worse. Sure they brought safety and prosperity to Bashkiria, but how long would it be until the street signs were in Russian?

Even with his spectacles he couldn't distinguish the people in the crowd. They were a blur of excitement and color. Scattered among them were reporters from every major newspaper in the empire. Around the stage a series of microphones would broadcast the audio of the auditorium into the homes of listeners all across Russia. Towards the back of the room there were even three tv cameras capturing the event for Russia's fledgling tv stations. Shulgin understood the enormity of this moment. He could only hope his speech was adequate for it. He inhales, clears his throat, and begins.\n\n"Citizens of the Empire, subjects of Tsar Vladimir, tonight I will speak with you about a subject of great importance. Over thirty years ago a great mutilation was inflicted upon Russia. The Soviet Union was a godless, treacherous dictatorship, but its evil falters in comparison to the fascist tyranny of the Nazis. They stole our territory. They stole the lives of our loved ones. They stole our future as a nation and a people. We will not let this attack go unanswered. We will take back our future, and reclaim what is rightfully ours! The Bolsheviks could not defend Russia, but your Tsar will not rest until he has liberated his subjects and avenged the decades of oppression they have endured. The great mutilation will be healed, and Russia will be united and prosperous, from Saint petersburg to Vladivostok! People of the Empire, join me in this righteous struggle! Your god and your Tsar stand behind you! When the children of the motherland march as one, we are unstoppable. Russia shall be glorious once more!"\n\nShulgin continued to speak, but no one could hear his words over the cacophony of cheers that filled the auditorium."

The horrid murals and statues erected by the cultists of the Aryan Brotherhood had been torn asunder and the people were beginning to regain the radiance they once had, before the dark times.\n\nIn the outskirts of the city, Alexander Medvedev returned to his small home. It was a somber day for the man as he returned from paying his respects to his late wife, taken from him by the cult so long ago. He passed through his kitchen, grabbing some leftover stew from the previous night, and sat in front of the radio, as he had every night since Prime Minister Gul had been elected. Tonight, he awaited a speech from the Prime Minister, directly from the capitol.\n\nThe music that had been playing, some patriotic march or other, cut out and the anchor spoke: "Now, we go live to Vyatka where Prime Minister Gul is making a historic announcement."\n\n"Good evening, fellow citizens of Russia. I come to you all tonight as a servant to the Empire and all of its peoples. I have accepted the position as your Prime Minister on the basis of a promise. A promise I reaffirm here today before all of Russia. I promise that in the coming days all of the peoples of Russia, from Vyatka to Moscow, from Bashkiria to Magadan shall know a better tomorrow. I shall work, with the help of the Tsar, to ensure the freedoms of every citizen of this empire. It matters not one's faith, or their culture, for all shall be free and equal," Gul's voice rang loudly through the lands of the Empire, and his words took root in the hearts of all of Russia. In his home in the outskirts of Perm, Alexander smiled, for the first time in so long. He could hear the conviction in Gul's voice, and deep within his heart, he felt hope, rekindled."

 vyatkasuper.13.desc:0 "In his long years of service, first to the doomed French cause and now to the Tsar, General Nikolay Rumyantsev had seen the depths of human depravity, and the heights of human valor. The horrors of the German advance into France, and the hell of the North African campaign were the crucible that forged him into the man he was today. In those days, even as the forces of Free France were pushed to the brink, he had endured much and felt in his heart a righteous anger against the Germans and their misbegotten allies. Now, as he observed green boys being molded by their instructors into the soldiers they needed to be, all he felt was a sort of melancholy.\n\nHe believed in the cause of Tsar Vladamir, to secure a future for the land of his ancestors, but at the same time he remembered the lives that had been destroyed by the wars in Russia and beyond. The men of the Foreign Legion that he led into battle, that he had ultimately failed, and even the men of the Empire who he served now. They were good men, all of them, but soon, after Russia had been secured, they would be thrown once again into the meat grinder against the German dogs who ruled over so much of Europe.\n\nNikolay was ready for that fight, in truth all of his life had molded him for just such a war, but the boys in the yard below him were not. He knew that, no matter how great their bravado, they were not ready to face the evils and depravity of the German menace. And yet, he would not allow that to stop them. The day of the final showdown between the Empire and the Nazis would be their crucible, and he would prepare them as best as he was able for that day."

 vyatkasuper.14.desc:0 "An unseasonable chill had descended on Vyatka, as Yakov Rivkin hurried his way through the streets on his way to one of the only kosher butchers in the city. He walked quickly past the throngs of people going about their day in the city. For the duration of his trip, he could not help but feel like something in the air had changed. The oppressive stares that always seemed to follow him when he left his home were gone, and he felt for the first time that he could slow down and enjoy his walk to the butcher.\n\nDespite this feeling, he kept at his quickened pace until he reached the door of the shop. He was surprised to note that the thugs who usually lounged outside were absent, and for a moment he worried that they had finally decided to ransack the shop. As he entered he saw that nothing was out of place, the tension he felt drained from his shoulders and he stood to his full height. At the counter, his friend Isaak stood. "Ah, Yakov, how are you my friend?"\n\n"Better than I have been, Isaak, better than I have in a long time," he replied. The days since his vicious beating at the hands of the Russian Protective Corps had brought with them a slow change to his life and that of the wider Jewish population of Vyatka. More and more he felt free to walk the streets with a sense of peace. "I'll take my usual, I am having Rahel over for dinner tonight," the widow had long been a balm on his soul, and he felt it only fair to return the favor every once in a while. As Isaak started to ready his order, he felt the need to share his observations. "I see those RPC thugs aren't standing watch anymore."\n\n"Hm? Ah, them. They got carted off by the police a couple days ago. Apparently, the new Prime Minister is at least somewhat serious about his promises. I've certainly been seeing better business since he was elected. A lot of gentiles, even," he admitted. That came as a surprise, a welcome one at that.\n\nAfter bidding the butcher a good night, Yakov walked back out into the frigid evening air, but this time he took his time to enjoy the walk."

 vyatkasuper.15.desc:0 "Prime Minister Roman Gul entered the study of his liege, Tsar Vladamir III, with some trepidation. This meeting had been a long time coming, and yet he had dreaded it in some ways. As he strode across the room to the Tsar's desk, he could only hope that he would be open to listen. "I thank you for granting me this meeting, your majesty. I understand this was a long time coming," he hoped to reassure the Tsar that he would be an able Minister.\n\n"Think nothing of it, Roman. I have... high hopes for your tenure," the Tsar's reply was hesitant, to say the least.\n\n"Your highness, I know that my election was not your preferred outcome. I know that Shulgin and the old guard were your first choice, and I am sure they would have done what they thought was best for Russia, but I would reassure you, my Tsar, I will not rest until the Empire is brought back to its old strength. However, by that same token, I will not allow the Empire to fall at the hands of the mistakes of the past. The old Empire fell because it was an unjust place that's mistakes brought about the anarchy that has plagued Russia for all these years. Those mistakes allowed the bolsheviks to oppress the peoples of Russia for decades, and I will not allow a repeat of those mistakes. Not when the fascists still control the heartland of old Russia. We must be united, from the lowest peasant to the highest of the nobility."\n\nThe Tsar looked upon Roman with a strange look in his eye, a respect he was unused to. "I understand, Roman. I... am confident in your decisions. Russia is in good hands," Vladimir looked almost shocked at his own words, but more than that he appeared thoughtful.\n\nThe meeting would last until dusk, a plan for the future of Russia was prepared and the Prime Minister felt all the better about the Tsar's support."

 vyatkasuper.16.desc:0 "Deep within an unassuming office building in downtown Vyatka, the head of the Ohkrana sat deep in thought as he looked over reports from his most trusted assets. Smyslovsky fumed as he sat there, his agents had confirmed what he had been dreading since the bastard Gul had been sworn in as Prime Minister. In the coming days, the Ohkrana would be downsized to an absurd amount, their budget was set to be slashed into just barely enough for the running of the agency. The bastard would expose the Empire to subversive agents, for what? Pathetic ideals of a failed system?\n\nThe deeper he read into the report the more angry he became, the already annoying oversight committee would be expanded, in fact that was where most of the former budget would go! What truly galled him, though, was what he read on the final page of the report. Apparently, the fool that the Tsar allowed to run his government would be asking for his resignation! Him, resign? Never! The bastards would have to drag him out of this office.\n\nMaking a decision, he picked up his phone to make a call to his most loyal operatives. However, the call refused to go through. Fearing the worst, he tried to call another of his operatives, but that line was also unresponsive. After trying a few more numbers he came to realize something - he had been out played.\n\nThe next week he received a call from the office of the Prime Minister, a call that would end with him accepting his resignation. The Ohkrana had been gutted, and he could do nothing but meekly accept it."

 vyatkasuper.17.desc:0 "Tsar Vladimir III sat, somewhat content, in his office. In the aftermath of Roman Gul's ascendence to the office of Prime Minister, he had been worried. He had worried that the Empire would fall without the stability promised by Shulgin and his people. And yet, as he sat there at his desk, he could feel at least somewhat happy with how things were turning out.\n\nGul had proven to be a capable administrator and a man who could be counted on to ensure the safety and prosperity of the Russian people. This was a reassuring balm on the anxiety of his soul. Since the days in which he was forced to collaborate with the German bastards, he had struggled with his decisions. Was he doing the right thing? Would he ever see the Empire whole? He reached over to his desk drawer, the one that hid his shame, but stopped himself before he could open it.\n\nNow, after so much progress had been made, he could say that he had found the closest thing he could to a semblance of peace. He knew that, with or without him, the Empire would grow and become a better place for all its people. It would be an Empire that he will be proud to watch his daughter grow in. Vladimir smiled, an ever more common occurrence in these days, and reflected on his life.\n\nHe found that he was closer than ever to answering those questions. Despite all of the progress he and the Empire had made, he knew that this was just the beginning, that the Empire had a long way to go, and he had an even longer road to follow. But he would walk that road, head held high."
