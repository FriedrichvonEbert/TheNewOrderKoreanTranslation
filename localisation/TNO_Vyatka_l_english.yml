 ### 지도자 설명 ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "1917년 태어나면서부터 망명 생활을 한 블라디미르 키릴로비치 로마노프 대공은 아버지이자 사망한 차르 니콜라이 2세의 사촌인 키릴 블라디미로비치가 1938년 죽은 후 망명 러시아 황가의 수장이 되었습니다.\n\n제2차 세계 대전 당시 브르타뉴에 거주하던 블라디미르는 얼마 가지 못해 가족과 함께 독일에게 구류되었습니다. 곧 블라디미르는 독일 당국의 '강요'로 러시아인들에게 소비에트 정권에서 망명하기를 권하는 라디오 방송을 하며 부역을 시작했습니다. 전쟁이 끝날 때는 우크라이나 섭정직을 제안 받았지만, 러시아의 분열이라는 받아들일 수 없는 결과를 불러올 직위를 거절했습니다.\n\n하지만, 전쟁이 끝나도 블라디미르는 러시아로 돌아갈 수 없었습니다. 독일인들은 블라소프 때처럼 블라디미르의 인기가 독일 통치를 약화시킬까 걱정했습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 벌어진 뒤에야 독일인들을 설득할 수 있었던 블라디미르는 왕정주의자와 백계 망명자들로 이루어진 사단 하나를 만들어 매우 성공적인 역습을 이끌었습니다. 국방군 공세가 멈출 때 블라디미르는 멈추지 않고 그대로 돌파해 러시아에 왕정주의자들이 지배하는 고립 구역을 만들었습니다.\n\n이후 몇 년 동안, 새로 선포된 차르 블라디미르 3세는 자신의 구역을 별로 확장하지 못했고, 수많은 내부의 골칫거리도 찾아냈습니다. 이제 차르는 기다립니다. 공격해 그의 신성한 생득권인 전 러시아를 되찾을 순간을 기다립니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC:0 "서러시아의 마지막 군주 보리스 1세의 이야기는 기이하지만 대단히 흥미롭습니다. 보리스 미하일로비치 스코시레프는 당시 러시아 제국 땅이었던 빌나의 부유한 가문에서 태어났습니다. 보리스는 상류 계급 가문의 일원이었지만 태어날때는 어떤 직위의 권리주장자도 아니었습니다. 그렇지만 혈통이 가져다 줄 수 없는 것을 스스로 얻어냈습니다.\n\n10월 혁명이 발발했을 때, 보리스는 도망쳐 수많은 망명자 중 하나가 되었습니다. 곧 영국 외무부에서 이름을 날렸고 수많은 임무에 참가했습니다. 그 뒤에는 네덜란드에, 그리고 지금까지 밝혀진 그의 모험 중 제일 유명한 일이 벌어진 곳 - 안도라에 발을 디뎠습니다. 조심스럽게 음모를 꾸민 보리스는 1930년대에 대중의 지지를 통해 대공 직위를 빼앗았으며 안도라를 현대 국가로 만들겠다고 약속했습니다. 얼마 못가 체포 및 수감되었지만 서유럽 감옥에서 몇 년을 보낸 후, 운 좋게 나치 점령 당국에게 풀려나 이들과 협조했습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 일어나고 차르 블라디미르가 원정을 떠날 때, 보리스는 기꺼이 합류해 충성스러운 연락책으로서 블라디미르와 함께했습니다. 그 위치가 불편해지기 전까지는 말입니다.\n\n반공경비대가 승리를 거듭할 때 스코시레프는 가만히 있지 않았습니다. 어느날, 반공경비대가 뱟카에 접근하자 보리스는 도시 중심부로 가서 총질을 한 다음, 과거의 서러시아 당국은 끝났으며 키르피흐니코프의 군대가 이를 대체한다고 선언했습니다. 이제 뱟카 대공이자 변방 지대의 수호자인 보리스 1세는 반공경비대와 러시아 국민의 이름으로 도시의 부패한 지도자들을 대신해 이 땅을 다스립니다. 이 공국이 얼마나 오래갈지 누가 알겠습니까."

 ### Ideas ###
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction:0 "부끄럼 없는 반발"
 KIR_unrepentant_reaction_desc:0 "구 제국이 무너진 후 러시아는 여러 폭군들 밑에서 고통받아왔습니다. 공산주의와 그 가면을 쓴 대리인 사회주의는 러시아 국민들에게 얼마 남지 않은 것마저 뺏어가고자 발광했습니다. 이러한 행보에 대해 차르께서는 '더는 안된다!'라고 선포하셨습니다. 제국은 다시 일어날 것입니다. 공산주의자들은 말살될 것입니다. 차르의 정당한 통치와 함께, 이 위대한 땅에 평화가 돌아올 것입니다."

 KIR_officer_infighting:0 "군사적 내분"
 KIR_officer_infighting_desc:0 "백군, 혹은 그 잔당들은 통일 전선을 이루었던 적이 한 번도 없습니다. 공산주의에 대한 증오가 백군을 단결시키지만 통일 러시아를 어떻게 통치해야 할지에 관한 문제는 차르의 군대의 단결을 깨부술 수도 있습니다. 일부는 과거의 이상을 믿지만 다른 이들은 민주주의를 요구합니다. 심지어 몇몇은 파시즘 정권의 힘을 말하기도 합니다. 이들이 줄 맞춰 설 수 있게 해주는 것은 차르 뿐이십니다. 그것도 간신히 이루어지는 것이지만 말입니다. 나라가 잃었던 것을 되찾으려면 군대가 튼튼히 단결하도록 해야한다는 것은 확실합니다."

 KIR_officers_reigned_in:0 "억제된 장교진"
 KIR_officers_reigned_in_desc:0 "어려운 일이었지만, 국가는 군 장교단의 최악의 영향력과 행동들을 억제하는데 성공했습니다. 문제 있는 장교들이 면직되거나 기소되었기에 시간과 정치력이 좀 들 것이며 인력 문제도 일어날 것입니다. 하지만 장교진이 곧 목적을 위해 단결할 것을 차르께서 믿으실 수 있습니다. 이제 분열된 지도부는 우리 군대에 부정적 영향을 끼치지 않습니다."

 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself:0 "차르와 그 자신"
 KIR_the_tsar_and_himself_desc:0 "옛날처럼 차르께서 전제 권력을 가지고 다스리십니다. 하지만 최근 차르께서 신민들의 마음 속에서 자유주의와 민주주의 이상이 피어나는 것을 보셨습니다. 많은 이들이 철저히 무시하라고 조언드렸지만, 차르께서는 자신이 벼랑 끝에 서있다는 것을 아십니다. 과거에 그랬던 것처럼 국민들의 사랑이 매우 빨리 증오로 변할 수 있는 벼랑 말입니다. 그러니 차르께서는 곧 선택을 하셔야 합니다. 조상들이 그리하셨듯 홀로 다스리시거나, 국민들의 차르의 정부에서 자신의 말을 할 수 있게 해주시거나."

 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea:0 "국민의 황제"
 KIR_the_peoples_tsar_idea_desc:0 "차르께서는 국내 많은 공장과 산업시설로 짧은 순방을 떠나 노동자들을 만나고 이들에게 제일 큰 영향을 주는 문제를 해결하기 위해 행동하셨습니다. 이는 수많은 신민들 하나하나와의 결속을 보여주시려는 노력의 일환이었습니다. 이를 통해 얻을 수 있는 정치적 이익을 마다할 수는 없을 것이며 차르의 개인적인 관심은 공장들이 생산률을 높이는 촉진제가 될 것은 의심의 여지가 없습니다. 하지만 차르께서 선언한 '해결책'이 갑자기 도입되며 효율이 저하될 것으로 보입니다."

 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea:0 "황제의 거리두기"
 KIR_imperial_detachment_idea_desc:0 "The Tsar's decision to preserve that intangible aspect of character critical to his role as a monarch, as well as to focus on matters of state rather than matters of publicity, has resulted in his personal withdrawal from many events, even as his person remains in the minds of all those present. While this is no doubt reassuring to many, who can be secure in the knowledge that their Tsar is fixing problems before they become apparent to society at large, making his position known to the public through functionaries does require additional efforts to be made."

 KIR_kirov_vodka:0 "뱟카 보드카"
 KIR_kirov_vodka_desc:0 "뱟카 양조장은 전력으로 돌아가며 수많은 양의 고품질 증류주를 생산하고 있습니다. 이 술들은 집에서 마실 수도 있고, 해외로 수출할 수도 있으며, 의료 시설이나 군대에서 고품질 소독제로 쓸 수도 있습니다. 몇몇에게는 웃기게 보일지도 모르겠지만 보드카는 러시아의 주식입니다. 모두가 마시는 매 병에 통일 모국이 담겨있다는 생각과 함께 통일을 위해 더 열심히 일하며 낭비를 덜 하도록 격려를 받습니다."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana:0 "현대의 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_desc:0 "The Tsar has wisely reconstituted the Okhrana, the Imperial intelligence and counter-revolutionary police force. With resources so dedicated, and with the knowledge that they shield the state from enemies both foreign and domestic, they will act to improve the state's cryptographic capabilities as well as minimize the operations of bandit and partisan strikes on its forces. In addition, and through the sharing of obtained information, they will also serve to better the tactical dispositions of military commanders in the field."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2:0 "제약받는 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_2_desc:0 "Although critical to national security, the Okhrana cannot be permitted to operate without oversight. As a result, a supervisory body has been established to prevent excesses. Though this naturally reduces its effectiveness, it is a small price to pay to ensure that overzealous actions do not threaten political stability."

 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3:0 "강화된 오흐라나"
 KIR_modern_age_okhrana_3_desc:0 "Without the constant vigilance of the Okhrana, the Tsar's government would have long ago fallen to revolutionaries, traitors, or worse. It must therefore be given wide latitude to intercept and eliminate potential threats before they become real ones. Though it is likely that some 'mistakes' will be made, it is a small price to pay to ensure the security of the state."

 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea:0 "백군 전통"
 KIR_white_army_traditions_idea_desc:0 "By directly connecting the traditions of the army to that of the old, uncorrupted Imperial state, the Tsar has encouraged the formation of a true modern army with Russian sensibilities. Disciplined, proud, meritocratic, and well-organized, it is far superior to the 'armies' of the many Russian statelets, and will proudly carry the banner through both European Russia and on the long journey to the Far East."

 KIR_imperial_special_forces:0 "제국 특수부대"
 KIR_imperial_special_forces_desc:0 "As part of the state's reorientation away from tradition and towards modern approaches to warfare, an increased focus has been placed on the selection and training of specialist formations. While this focus certainly increases the efficacy of these special units, the stringent requirements for induction within them has resulted, at least temporarily, in an overall reduction of recruitment efforts."

 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea:0 "머릿수의 힘"
 KIR_strength_in_numbers_idea_desc:0 "Holding true to the classical Russian focus on manpower and numerical superiority, the state's military has vastly expanded recruitment, relaxing standards and searching for recruits outside traditional areas. While this does mean many more soldiers will be entering the Tsar's armies, it also means that they are, at least for a time, likely to be somewhat less effective as training programs are stretched beyond their natural limits."

 KIR_general_staff_academy:0 "뱟카 합동참모학교"
 KIR_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "The establishment of a unified, and universal, training curriculum for the state's military officers has, as expected, resulted in an overall increase in military capability.

 KIR_archives_of_samara:0 "Archives of Samara"
 KIR_archives_of_samara_desc:0 "Samara served as an evacuation point for Soviet state records during their collapse in the Second World War. With the state's capture of the city and careful examination of said archives, valuable insights into the personalities and responses of the West Russian Revolutionary Front (WRRF) have been obtained, assisting in future combat against them."

 KIR_the_bridgeburners_desc:0 ""교량소각대"로 잘 알려진 제국특수작전부대는 적 후방에서 직접 행동을 벌이는 임무를 맡은 군-오흐라나 합동 특수 부대입니다. 이들은 수송대를 공격하고, 혼자 다니는 장교를 암살하고, 네, 별명대로 다리도 파괴합니다. 이들의 활동은 국가의 적들의 방어 능력을 저하시킬 것입니다. 놈들의 병사들이 싸우러 오기 전부터 말입니다."

 KIR_solidarist_economy_desc:0 "Applying their policies of corporatism to the plans of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the Solidarists have enshrined the input of interest groups and concentrated economic sectors within industrial planning.

 KIR_unionist_economy_desc:0 "Continuing previous policies of austerity, only now under the supervision of the Imperial Recovery Committee, the National Union has continued to restrict government spending in nearly all social sectors.

The city's wharves are bustling, merchants are moving ever larger carhoes, and revenue increases month-over-month. However, the Tsar and those who advise him are always looking forward.\n\nA plan to establish Vyatka as a central trade hub for Western Russia has been put forward and accepted.

Factories lie abandoned, as artisans produce what little they can in basement workshops. Fields lie fallow, as farmers focus on subsistence farming to feed themselves and their families. If action is not taken, our fragile economy will soon collapse entirely.\n\nTo address this, a plan for austerity has been put before the Tsar. Severe cuts to services, education, and security will be painful, especially for the many already suffering. But they are necessary. And the Tsar has been very clear - they will not last forever."

A decision on the severity of the austerity measures has been made by the Tsar.\n\nAnd he has chosen to moderate the proposal. Cuts will be made, some quite painful, but they will be compassionate. The Tsar will not impose undue burden on his people, and sectors that are identified as critical to the basic needs of the population will be spared the worst of the reductions.

In both our state and elsewhere, ordinary Russians rely on local paths and trail guides for most travel. That naturally strangles trade, industrial and economic development, and military operations. It must be addressed.\n\nTo solve this, The Tsar and his government will fund public works projects throughout the Principality, building new infrastructure and repairing the old while also providing employment. The Germans will destroy some of it, of course, but we will maintain commitment, whatever the cost. The future demands it."

The result has been the near-complete absence of appreciable investment or credit, lack of confidence in currencies, a return to the hoarding of precious metals, and the development of a barter-based economy amongst citizens.\n\nWith the establishment of public works and austerity programs, the next step is to rectify this critical issue through the creation of a central bank. Such a creation will help to legitimize, promote trust in, and set policy for our currency. Further, it will allow for both the stimulation and regulation of commercial and private lenders, encouraging economic growth in all sectors."

Infrastructure, healthcare, social programs, and more will be cut to the bone in order to establish the state's financial security and provide a basis for our future designs of territorial reclamation.

Dedicating them to the military is an obvious choice - without secure control of our lands we cannot accomplish anything of note. Additional resources will allow them to recruit more soldiers, acquire more equipment, and improve their readiness.\n\nWe do, however, expect a negative response from the public, given what they have had to surrender in order to make this military expansion a possibility. Nevertheless, we are committed - regardless of the unpopularity of this action, we are preparing for the future of all of Russia, and in time the public will understand."

Revenue must therefore increase, and the only appreciable way to do that is through significant increases in taxation. Levies on a wide basket of basic and consumer goods should be sufficient, and though it will cause further public discontent, there is currently no other choice available.\n\nIt is, however, believed that this measure should be the last required in order to obtain the funds needed for significant public investments, which would then permit the relaxation of austerity programs. We will show our citizens that their anger has been misplaced. But they must endure for a little while longer."

And then they failed, twice, at protecting her from rapacious invaders.\n\nAlthough the scars of their crimes remain, there is still hope. Tsar Vladimir, proud scion of the Romanovs, has returned. It is his divine right to rule Russia and its people, and when opportunity presents itself, he will crush the bandits, fascists, communists, and fanatics that have conspired to tear Russia apart.\n\nThe Third Rome will rise again."

Apart from the Tsar himself, we are seeing this in the Principality, with many of the 'temporary' government organs established years ago still in operation. We must learn from the past, and not allow it to be repeated.\n\nConsequently, we will act decisively to untangle this web, clearing out redundant offices, formalizing needed governmental services, and dispatching with wasteful excess. In such a way, we will strengthen our control over both our current, and future, territory."

 KIR_the_great_game:0 "그레이트 게임"

On a daily basis deals are made and broken, favours are traded, and information is exchanged amongst the many functionaries of our state.\n\nBut there is a limit, and the degree of these exchanges have, recently, threatened to divide the government to an unacceptable degree. The Tsar is not blind to this, and he knows that such efforts distract from any eventual efforts to reunify the nation. But he also knows that to act to reduce it could engender the opposite effect. Prudence is required.\n\nHe will therefore demonstrate his public displeasure with such actions, weakening the positions of those engaging in them without provoking conflict. But he will not forget, and when the state is more secure there will be a reckoning."

Our Principality is no different. While all agree that Tsar Vladimir is the rightful ruler of all of Russia, they disagree on how his rule should be expressed.\n\nAbsolutists believe he should be unrestricted while constitutionalists believe there should be checks on his authority. Fascists, socialists, and others also routinely present their own views. All of these forms of monarchy, and a great deal more, are regularly advocated for. But none can say which will, eventually, emerge to dominate the others."

Though they failed in their mission, the lessons learned through that failure have not been forgotten.\n\nTo combat these dissidents, the Okhrana will be recreated, and the issues that led to their previous failure will be corrected. Once again they will watch over and guard our Tsar, our state, and our way of life. In so doing ensure the stability of our Principality and, one day, our Empire."

He must, and will, be seen as the manifestation of the national collective will, and as the staunch defender of the Imperial constitution.

That changed, very suddenly, when an enormous explosion rocked the building, heaving the floor to one side and throwing the agents down to it.\n\nKnowing that the timing of the explosion was too perfect to be a coincidence, and further knowing how fortunate they truly were to be on site at the time of it, rather than arriving after the fact, the agents scrambled to recover. Running against the crowds of workers, and towards the site of the explosion, Yevgeny spotted a figure standing nearby. A figure that appeared all too calm.\n\nCalling out to Valentin, Yavgeny drew his weapon and rushed towards the figure.

Joining one of the teams themselves, the agents found themselves watching one such factory, the primary target listed in the plan discovered in Vyatka.\n\nWith long-developed and well-practiced skills of surveillance, it was not long before Yevgeny first saw the figure first approaching, and then entering, the factory. Moving quickly, Yevgeny, Valentin, and the support team followed. As Yevgeny approached the figure, he realized that it was attaching a device to one of the factory's fuel tanks, and drew his sidearm while calling out a challenge. The figure immediately took off running.\n\nAs Yevgeny and Valentin began to give chase, the local agents moved to take care of the device, and Yevgeny gave thanks that the agents had been there to assist.

The man was young, probably not out of his twenties, and clearly very physically fit besides. Fit enough that he was pulling ahead of the agent.\n\nAs Yevgeny emerged into the cold Izhvesk air, Valentin following closely behind, he knew that he would have to make a decision as to the best way to catch the likely saboteur."

Yevgeny realized he had a clear shot and, knowing that it was preferable to eliminate an enemy agent if escape could not be prevented, slowed to better his aim, firing three times a moment later.\n\nOne shot found its mark, striking the saboteur in the shoulder, but before he could fire again the figure, after several stumbling steps, disappeared into shadow. Yevgeny cursed as Valentin stopped beside him, equally angry.\n\nBoth agents knew that they would mobilize the city's officers to try and find the saboteur, and both knew it was unlikely to lead to an arrest. Already the saboteur would be executing an escape plan, and within hours would be deep in the Russian forests, if not in the territory of another power altogether.\n\nYevgeny and Valentin looked at each other, sharing a grimace.

They were dismissed soon after\n\nIt took several days before the decision was actually made, but all knew what it would be. The services of Yevgeny and Valentin would no longer be needed.

Trying to do so only slowed you down, he would say, and often did little to hinder pursuit. As such, and despite the obvious difference in physicality, he found himself gaining on the saboteur. He realized he had a clear shot, if he had wanted it.\n\nBut he, they, needed the man alive. He was their connection, their next link in the cell's chain. He could not be allowed to get away. And, as they approached an exit to the factory's grounds, Yevgeny saw that he would not. Suddenly appearing in front of him through herculean effort, Valentin barreled into the saboteur, knocking him flat and pinning him onto the ground.\n\nAs Yevgeny rushed forward and pressed his pistol to the saboteur's head, Valentin prepared restraints.

As a an agent of the cell, now known to be comprised of both infiltrators from the Revolutionary Front along with local communist and socialist dissidents, he was able to offer insight into its activities as well as identifying information about his direct contacts.\n\nAs a result of their quick actions in Izhvesk, Yevgeny and Valentin, together with many other loyal agents, were able to, in short order, make a number of additional arrests and work their way further up the chain. Before long, the ability of the cell to conduct operations was crippled, and though several members of it escaped, its ability to act as a serious threat to the Tsar's regime was destroyed.\n\nThus, despite the failure to halt the attack in Izhvesk, the Okhrana saw the overall result as a victory for themselves, for the Tsar, and for the integrity of monarchism as an institution."

Sometimes men had to be found, run to ground, and delivered to their superiors, whatever the collateral damage to the families or friends of their quarry.

So few still alive remembered the times of the old Romanovs, having succumbed to age, Bukharin's communist propaganda, or the violence and war that had consumed Russia, and Shulgin believed it his duty, his purpose, to spread that knowledge once again. In his mind, if he could do so, if he could show the people an alternative to instability and strife and a pathway to greatness, he could help promote the eventual restoration of the Tsar's authority over all of Russia.\n\nAfter hours of review, Shulgin inspected his document one final time. A proud declaration of the resilience of the Russian people and the glory of monarchism, it would no doubt bolster the morale of the Principality's citizens. Shulgin was no propagandist, but he well understood that, in hard times, the people needed to be reminded of both the dedication of their Tsar to them and the similar dedication expected from them in return.\n\nShulgin believed, with every fiber of his being, that the only thing that could save Russia was a return to the empire he had once lived in, and to the strong central authority of the Tsar.\n\nWith deep respect, he signed the document and left it on his desk.

Slightly startled, he paid special attention to what it had to say.\n\n"Young men of Russia are heeding the call of duty to their Tsar and their country to bring salvation to all of Russia. From the most remote villages to the most bustling cities, young men and veterans alike have joined the Imperial army. In these uncertain times of strife and war, we must remain vigilant. Nazis and Communists assail our great Empire and you could be the driving force between victory and slavery."\n\n"Those brave souls who enlist today will be given the chance to serve their fellow man in the grand armies of the Tsar! Build lasting friendships and a sense of brotherhood with their fellow soldiers! Protect your loved ones from the predations of the Fascist and Communist alike!"\n\n"All those who enlist will be entitled to extra rations for their families along with a pension and assorted other long term benefits. Would you like to pursue an education beyond the rudimentary level? All enlistees will be granted subsidised secondary and tertiary education. Would you like to know more? Then head to your nearest recruiting station today! And remember, service guarantees prosperity!"\n\nAs the ad faded and the music started once again, Aleksandr could not help but be absorbed in the thought of enlisting. It wasn't necessarily a matter of patriotism, he honestly didn't care for politics, but the benefits were enticing. It would be dangerous, yet he could not help but think of his parents. They were getting on in age and could certainly use the help.\n\nHe would sit there for hours mulling things over before he grabbed his coat and strode into the cold air, his mind made up. Early the next day he was shipped off to boot camp, to fight for the Tsar."

He was just a worker, barely making a living in Vyatka as a farm hand before coming to work at the Imperial Distillery. Even when he was just a farm hand, the military rarely came around and only to collect taxes or clear bandits. In the city, they acted as more of a police force, but they still weren't rigid to the bone. Now, they were a true, disciplined army.\n\nHe had heard from some of his friends that the factories were being shifted to focus on military production. Propaganda leaflets and radio ads could be seen and heard throughout the city, encouraging young men like him to join. Dimitri had no interest in this, for he wished to live. After all, he had seen the end of the bombings he had had to learn to deal with all his life, he wasn't going to die now after they had just stopped dropping the bombs.\n\nHowever, he also knew what this meant for the city. Vytaka was out in the open and easy to attack. Bandits had not tried to attack the city due to their disorganization and the defenses of the city, but Vytaka did not plan on going against bandits. No, the Tsar wished to go to war with his enemies in the name of restoring his hold over all of Russia. That meant that the city would go under martial law, and the army would protect the city against any foe. He worried that the city may even become a battleground, blown to shreds by artillery shells.\n\nBut there was no point in worrying himself over what could happen, for it would bode well for his mind. His mother always did say the mind was sometimes the greatest enemy of a man, and she was right. He had to keep working, for if he didn't, who knows what would happen. So he went to work at the distillery as soldiers continued to march in the streets, their officers shouting orders at them and war on their very lips."

 vyatkaexp.1.desc:0 "For many years Alexander Kazembek and Tsar Vladimir III of Vyatka were political allies. Indeed, it was the Tsar who appointed Kazembek as governor of Berezniki and permitted him to continue to grow the Mladorossi movement there.\n\nAlthough relations broke down some time ago, and Kazembek separated us from the central government in Vyatka, it would appear that the Tsar is determined for his authority to return to Berezniki, one way or another.\n\nWhile we are willing to fight, the Tsar's army is much larger and better equipped than our own, and so the offer for Kazembek and the Tsar to meet and discuss terms was a welcome one. If we can extract concessions and protections from the Tsar, even as we agree to rejoin his state, we can continue to spread our beliefs in peace and security.\n\nMany senior figures in the movement have expressed support for the talks, and the only thing remaining is to see if Kazembek, whose voice carries more weight than all others combined, agrees as well."

Though the terms reached were not wholly satisfactory to either party, they were enough to establish acceptance.\n\nKazembek has agreed that he and his Mladorossi will return Berezniki to state control, allow us to appoint central administrators to oversee the territory, and will remove themselves from its current government.\n\nIn return, the Tsar will grant amnesty to the movement's members, guarantee equal political participation by the movement in any future elections, without harassment or impediment by state organs and, most important, relax restrictions on the formation and operation of labor unions within state territory.\n\nThough not all are happy with the Tsar's concessions, most agree that a bloodless solution to the situation is far superior to its alternative, and none can argue with the resumption of resource collection from the governorate."

He knew that his actions had been right, regardless of where he now found himself. The people of his country needed emancipation from the regimes they found themselves crushed by, and that emancipation would not come at the hands of a Tsar, just as it would not come at the hands of a communist. It would come from what he had strived for: something in between. Unfortunately, Russia was simply not yet ready to hear it.\n\nAs the judge proclaimed his sentence - lifetime imprisonment - Kazembek held his head high. He knew he was right. He knew he always had been, and that he always would be. And one day, when the unmoderated tyranny of the Tsar was ended by the acts of more successful men such as he, he knew would walk to freedom, vindicated by all.\n\nWhen the guards escorted Kazembek, still defiant, out of the room and towards the waiting transport, all eyes were upon him. Nobody noticed the frowning man in the corner, disappointment written on his face. Boris Skosyrev had hoped to see Kazembek hang, but he accepted that he would have to be content with the outcome nonetheless."

He was a caring figure, but that care was tempered with the detachment necessary of a man who had to make momentous decisions. And he was no ardent supporter of the monarchy. At least not yet.\n\nAs talks continued, the real question was soon asked - what would the Tsar have to do to ensure the peaceful integration of the Order into his realm? Antipin replied immediately, clearly having prepared a response long in advance.\n\nTo the south, in and around Perm, lay the lands of the Aryan 'Brotherhood,' a fanatic and clearly insane sect, and one that had long troubled both the Tsar and those protected by the Order. If the Tsar wanted to prove his piety to both God and the Order, if he wanted to prove his dedication to the common people of Russia, he would have to exterminate this abomination, root and stem.\n\nTsar Vladimir carefully considered Antipin's words.

How else could he have made the choice to invade the lands of the Order, sack the Fortress-Monastery, and kill so many of Daniil's fellow monks?\n\nDanill had spent most of his young life in the order, believing absolutely in its holy mission to protect the weak and downtrodden from the jackals that surrounded them. But he had failed. They had failed. And now when he spoke to God, he didn't hear anything in response except the screams of his brothers as the soldiers shot them down.\n\nBut he was still alive, and he would avenge them. It was a long way to Vyatka, through hard terrain and even harder soldiers. But he would make it. He knew he would. He shifted as he felt the rifle dig into his side. It was in Vyatka that the false Tsar made his home, and though Daniil knew he would die, he also knew he had a duty to protect millions of other Russians from the honeyed words and false promises of this hateful Romanov.\n\nHe only needed one shot."

The Tsar's concessions to the movement regarding labor unions seems to have triggered particular outrage besides.\n\nWhile we have attempted to explain the position of our government on the matter, the Order has indicated they are not interested in further communication.

A tattered flag bearing the hooked cross and weighted tricolour of the Aryan Brotherhood.\n\nFurious that such an icon of blasphemy had been brought to his lands, the Grandmaster only paused when the officer smiled wide. "You don't understand, Grandmaster," he said, eyes twinkling, "this was the first flag of the Brotherhood. Taken from their 'Fyurer's' personal quarters. They're defeated."\n\nAs quick as his rage had formed, it had subsided, and Antipin quickly snatched the flag and tossed into a nearby fire. As it burned, he gave thanks to God that the jackals had been defeated by one so righteous as Tsar Vladimir, and he gave the officer the response he knew the man wanted.\n\nThe Tsar had proven himself worthy, and so the Order of Saint George would join him, for the good of all Russia."

Sleep was a luxury. Food a boon. A day without beatings nonexistent. On this particular day, however, there were far fewer guards than usual, and Vadim wondered if it had anything to do with the explosions in the distance. Explosions that had been getting closer every day.\n\nSome time later, Vadim realized with a start that the guards, all of them, were gone. The gate was left open. And, as he looked at it, a man in a uniform he had never seen before stepped through. More followed behind, and began spreading through the complex. Stunned, overwhelmed, Vadim stood still, frozen in place. Until, from the highest tower, the one the guards used as a sniper's nest, the flag bearing the hated swastika was cut down, and the tricolour of the Imperial state was unfurled.\n\nVadim fell to his knees, his muscles suddenly weak, and tears streamed down his face.

But still the gunshots continued. Gathering a small party of soldiers, he moved towards the sounds, and as he grew closer his heart began to sink. The gunshots were being joined by screams.\n\nAs he finally reached the origin of the noise, he knew immediately what it was - a cleansing. A party of the Royalist Guard had rounded up a group of citizens and, after short 'interrogations,' executing them.\n\nStorming forward, he demanded a stop to the shootings, and further demanded to know what was going on. The commander just smiled and showed him a pass signed by the city's military governor. The captives were socialists, he said, members and saboteurs of the Revolutionary Front, and he was simply taking care of them.\n\nMikhail could see he had no power here. Were the captives truly socialists? Truly saboteurs? Or were they simply political enemies from the old Republic? Or personal enemies? An order to return to base came over his radio, and with one last look at the terrified captives, he obeyed.\n\nMikhail had once thought that using collaborators meant there would be less bloodshed.

It was being suggested by some that, owing both to their competence and their absolute opposition to communism, they could potentially be recruited into the Imperial Army. The Tsar knew that there were personal reasons for the suggestion as well - after all, many of the captured officers had once served alongside his own during the West Russian War - but there was genuine merit. Many of the generals were truly very skilled.\n\nThe suggestion was fiercely protested by other generals. Unlike both they and the Tsar himself, the men had not abandoned collaboration with the Germans until forced to do so, and they had generally fascist leanings besides. Vladimir faced a dilemma. Would he ignore the past of the ROA generals in the interests of pragmatism? Or would he conclude the cost was not worth the reward?\n\nHe had to decide."

The man was a very capable politician and administrator. And in the government he could both preach Mladorossi-influenced solutions to national problems and also identify sympathetic politicians and officials.\n\nMany officials are, unsurprisingly, critical of the suggestion to give a senior government position to one that they see as both a radical and a traitor, while others see it as a necessary concession towards the state's unification plans for Western Russia. Kazembek is no fool, and if this concession is granted prior to the Tsar's meeting with him, he will not accept a cabinet post without significant influence.\n\nThus, the central question has become whether we will accept the leader of the Mladorossi as an influential figure of our government in exchange for a decisive end to the crisis surrounding his rogue governorate."

But the outcome was never in doubt. It could not be.\n\nAs the sentences were read out, the revolutionaries looked on, stone-faced. They had sent thousands to their deaths after similar trials, and they knew what was coming. Death, for most. Lifetime imprisonment, for some. Long sentences, for a few, to allay allegations of forced harshness.

Following that, he took the time to meet with the soldiers nominated for awards, and taking over responsibility from the unit commander, personally conveyed the awards to those so nominated, with pictures taken all the while.\n\nBy the time he left, later that evening, many of the battalions soldiers seemed more confident, more focused, and more determined to complete their mission.\n\nThe visit was considered a great success, not only among the troops themselves, but also in how the public began to see their Tsar - as a man willing to leave his palace and meet those actually fighting for him, in stark contrast to many of the Romanovs of old."

Having now lived under two failed and brutal regimes, he was willing to give the so-called Tsar a chance. So far, as much as he could tell, the Romanov scion had done right by the people of Russia.\n\nHis attention was returned to the radio as the results of the Congress were announced. A victory, in a surprisingly clear majority, for the Constitutional-Democrats, or Kadets.\n\nMedvedev had not expected that. The Soviets had long taught that monarchism was inherently, and inexorably, reactionary. Instead, however, this new Empire seemed to be marching in the opposite direction, towards liberalism and democracy. He was not yet sure what to make of such a change, but he did know that he was looking forward to seeing what it truly meant.\n\nWith that thought, Medvedev finished his tea and went to bed.

He remembered the bleeding, how they fought and lost, and how he had now been forced to now beg on the streets to survive.\n\nThat is why didn't say anything as the Front rose and fell once more, and he remained silent as the Imperial Eagle flew once more over the city. Sergey didn't believe in the Communist dream anymore, but these men...they fought for a man who fought with the Germans during the West Russian War; In them, they carried hope. He chuckled to himself as he sat on the street corner, troops marching in the streets. In his life, he had learned one thing, one simple truth: Politicians and Generals fought, but people like him would always be forgotten in the end. However, as he watched those young men smile, he felt conflicted. Perhaps...perhaps they would be different in the end. Maybe an old man's cynicism would be proven wrong.\n\nHe laid back, and as his eyes grew heavy and breathing grew heavy, his thoughts were of home. His thoughts were of his family, and as he did, the old man Sergey gave one last smile as he drifted to eternal sleep"

Strife and warfare had been constants in his life which he rarely shied away from, yet as he walked down the aisle leading to His Imperial Majesty's suites, a slight feeling of nervousness rose in his chest as he prepared himself for his scheduled meeting. Gul took a deep breath before entering Vladimir's bureau.\n\nIt was like entering another world, one frozen in time: relics of another age presented all around he who dared to enter, Imperial furnitures striking Roman's gaze. And there was his liege, sat at his desk and seemingly having been awaiting the Prime Minister's arrival.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty!" He said, in accordance with Imperial etiquette "I trust that you're doing well today?"\n\n"Prime Minister Gul" Vladimir retorqued in a formal tone "A slight migraine but nothing but nothing too serious. Please, take a seat, I'm sure you have much to tell me."\n\nGul executed himself. As thoughts raced in his mind, Roman started elaborating on his reform plans to the Tsar:\n\n"As I evoked in the past Your Imperial Majesty, we cannot go on with how poorly regarded personal freedoms are in Russia: the people, Russian and non-Russian speaking citizens, is - and should always be - our priority. Each and every one of your subjects deserve better lives, brighter futures, and though much has been done under your reign, absolute rule and austerity measures cannot be the norm forever. Now that Western Russia is stable, I come seeking your blessing and help in enacting a better tomorrow for our countrymen. Lest we fall to chaos and infighting again if their words cannot reach us."\n\nGul wasn't wrong: Western Russia was under complete control and those pesky austerity measures could be loosened, if not removed entirely. Yet, the weary middle-aged Tsar, minding to keep a composed facade, couldn't help but be somewhat worried of how far Roman's reforms will go at the expense of the Crown's power."

Words like "Emergency Powers", "Restructuring from Above", and other authoritarian, autocratic terms flitted across the sheets in red ink.\n\nThe more he looked at it, the more he couldn't help but remember communiques from the past, when he had marched into Russia- and that fact did not put him at ease. "My Tsar." A voice interrupted his private musings, as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn took two steps towards him, and the documents he had been handed. "I understand your hesitation- or any concerns, but Russia is plagued with instability; and these measures are an important step to securing everyone's future." Aleksander's words had a certain logic to them- but his tone had cooled, and Vladmir felt a single pang of uncertainty ringing at the back of his mind like a siren, a small little warning bell that kept ringing even as Aleksander spoke.

The air has agreed with me much more as of late. Maria has been taking advantage of the clear skies as well. It has been a long time since I have seen her so happy." A rare smile crossed the Tsar's face at the thought of his daughter. Vasily was heartened to see the Tsar in good spirits and felt all the more comfortable talking to him at this time.\n\n"I am glad to hear that your family is well. I am hesitant to take you out of such happy thoughts, but I have come here today for a reason, my Tsar. We must talk about your role in the new government. As we both know, the days of the absolute monarch have come to their end. However, it is imperative that you remain active in the governance of the Empire. You will be a key component of the Imperial government, and will have the final word in the Empire. You cannot simply be complacent on the sidelines." Shulgin, above all else, was a proponent of stability in the Empire. The Tsar was the greatest unifying symbol in the Empire and his wholehearted participation in the government was a key point to ensure stability.\n\nThe Tsar took a moment to gather his thoughts. "I understand my duties, Vasily. I know what I must do for the success of the Empire, but I am only one man. I do not have any desire to manage every aspect of the nation." Vladimir understood all too well what lay at the end of that road, the death and hardship.\n\n"Of course, my Tsar.

Just like how Budweiser was the default beer of choice to the American public, Vyatka vodka had become the vodka of choice of the West Russian public. The hope of Anheuser-Busch was that if they secured an exclusive license with the Sovereignty, they would be able to corner the cheap alcohol market in the US.\n\nThat is why they sent Waylon, for he was one of the few PR people who knew a bit of Russian. Waylon had never been to Russia, and only knew Russian due to the fact he studied it alongside German, Spanish, and Italian. Used to the warm summers and mild winters of California, Russia was like a slap in the face with its winter. It wasn't helped by the locals in Vyatka always just...staring at him. He guessed that most had never seen a foreigner in their lives, and they were clearly hesitant around him.\n\nHowever, that did not matter, for Waylon was here for the vodka, not the people.

He would be touring many of the region's cities over the next few days, showing the people that their monarch had arrived to return them to the legitimate Russian government.\n\n"Good evening, people of the Empire," Solzhenitsyn began, "I speak to you tonight of victory in many forms. I speak to you first of military victory, as the last remnants of the enemy state have surrendered to the officers of our brave Imperial Army. I speak to you of economic victory, as production levels of consumer goods have reached their highest-ever recorded levels.

But ever since the conclusion of the Vologda Congress, that power had been taken away from him, piece by piece.\n\nThe Solidarists had triumphed, their message of national strength and reclamation resonating with the - his - people, and Solzhenitsyn had quickly moved to consolidate his government's power, both within the constitution and outside it.\n\n'Temporary' laws were passed in his name, and 'national security' initiatives restricted the rights of millions of Russians.

A promise that I affirm before all the peoples of Russia, from Arkhangelsk to Samara, and from Moscow to Vladivostok, that you shall know a better tomorrow."\n\n"My government, working closely together with the Tsar, a man whose dedication to liberation has never wavered, will act to ensure the fundamental and deserved freedoms of every citizen in the Empire. It matters not one's faith, or culture for they, and you, be Russians all. Russians all who will, one day soon, live in peace and prosperity under the Imperial flag!"\n\nThough Medvedev's radio was a simple one, even he could hear the sincerity in Gul's words ring out across the room. And, for the first time since the Tsar's authority had returned to Perm, he felt hope.\n\nHe knew that the rest of Russia could not but feel the same."

 vyatkasuper.13.desc:0 "General Nikolay Rumyantsev had been a soldier for most of life, first to the French and now to the Tsar, and in that time he had grown to know well both the heights of valor and depths of depravity of man.\n\nHe remembered the righteous anger that had driven him for so long, from France proper to the hell of North Africa, even when all had seemed, and in truth was, lost. And now, as he observed the new recruits receiving their basic training, he felt a deep melancholy.\n\nHe believed in Tsar Vladimir's cause to secure a future for the lands of his ancestors, but he could not forget the lives that had already been lost in pursuit of it, and of those that would be further lost as that pursuit continued. Especially once the inevitable campaign to secure the German-occupied lands to the west began.\n\nThe boys in front of him were strong men, driven by righteous anger, and they would be well trained. But he knew that they were not ready to face the true depravity of the German menace. Not ready for the meat grinder that they would be thrown into.\n\nBut he would not allow that to stop him. The day of the final showdown between Russia and Germany was fast approaching, and he would prepare them for that as best as he was able."

 vyatkasuper.14.desc:0 "As Yakov Rivkin once again walked the streets of Vyatka, he could not help but marvel at the change that had passed over the city. He saw it with every step.\n\nHe saw it in the complete lack of the hostile stares that had once followed him. He saw it in the absence of the thugs that had once menaced the Jewish neighborhood. And he saw it, as he entered the kosher butcher shop, on the face of Isaak, whose eyes brightened and smile widened in a way Yakov had not seen in many years.\n\n"Yakov!" Isaak exclaimed. "How are you, my friend?"\n\n"Better than I have been in a long time, Isaak." Yakov replied truthfully. The days since his vicious beating at the hands of the Russian Protective Corps had brought real change indeed, both to his life and to those of the wider Jewish population of Vyatka. "I'll take the usual again. Rahel and I are having dinner tonight." He looked through the window. "I noticed that the RPC doesn't seem to be around here anymore."\n\nIsaak chuckled in reply as he gathered Yakov's items. "Not anymore, no. The police carted them off a short while ago. The Prime Minister seems to be serious about his promises." He continued as he bagged the goods. "You know, I've started seeing more business since his election. More gentiles, even."\n\nThat surprised Yakov, even if it was most heartening. After bidding the butcher a good night, Yakov left to return home.\n\nOnly now, he would take the time to enjoy his walk."

 vyatkasuper.15.desc:0 "Although he had worked his whole life to reach the position he now held, Prime Minister Roman Gul could not suppress his nervousness as he entered the Tsar's study.\n\nHe knew that his politics were radically different to the Tsar's own, and he only hoped that his monarch would be willing to listen. As Vladimir welcomed him cordially and invited him to sit, Gul offered his respects, and began to speak.\n\n"Thank you, your Majesty, for this meeting. I know that you and I do not see eye to eye on many things, but I want you to know that both I and my government desire nothing more than to see the Empire brought forward into the modern age."\n\nThe Tsar nodded slowly. "I see, Mr. Prime Minister," he said, somewhat stiffly. "I have...high hopes for your tenure."\n\nGul decided to be direct. "I am pleased to hear it, Your Majesty. I know that I, or rather we, were not likely your personal preference to form government, but we entirely share your views on the aggressive pursuit of reunification. I must stress, however, that the mistakes of the past, the rigidity of policy that allowed communism and fascism alike to divide Russia, will not be permitted to take hold again. And in order to ensure stability, the monarchy must be seen to be supportive of its government's agenda."\n\nThe Tsar was silent for a long moment, and Gul feared the worst. And then Vladimir nodded again, but this time his expression was more thoughtful. "I understand, Roman" he said, clearly having made a decision. "We shall work together."\n\nThe meeting would continue, but when it ended, many hours later, Roman Gul felt confidence, for the first time in a long time, that things were actually about to improve."

 vyatkasuper.16.desc:0 "Sitting behind his small bronze plaque, Boris Smyslovsky fumed. He had just been told: Gul was planning to slash their budget. Significantly. Down to almost nothing.\n\nMen, liberals, like Gul were all the same. Idealists of failed systems, they believed in redirecting resources from security to social programs. In so doing, all they accomplished, all they had ever accomplished, was to expose the state to subversive agents. To dissidents. To communists!\n\nOnce Gul was through with it, the funding that the Okhrana received would barely be enough to maintain basic operations, let alone run meaningful investigations or recruit agents. What was worse, those still sympathetic to the Okhrana's true purpose had told him that Gul intended to demand his resignation.\n\nHim! He who had build the Ohkrana from nothing to one of the most efficient and feared services Russia had ever seen. He who had protected the state and the Tsar from plots innumerous! He who had no intention, whatsoever, of resigning.\n\nBut for all of Smyslovsky's acumen in the world of intelligence, he was no politician, and when he tried to call men he thought his allies in an attempt to avoid the inevitable, none would accept his call. And so, when the call from Gul's office finally did come, he had no choice.\n\nThe Ohkrana had been gutted, and he could do nothing but accept it."

 vyatkasuper.17.desc:0 "Tsar Vladimir III sat at his desk, feeling an emotion he had not felt in a long time - true contentment.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Kadets' election, he had been worried. He did not share Gul's political position, and he had thought the stability he had fought so hard for would be threatened. And yet things had turned out well. Better than expected.\n\nGul had proven a most capable administrator, and his dedication to ensuring the stability and prosperity of both the state and the Russian people could not be denied. Vladimir knew that, with or without him, the Empire would expand, and become a better place for all of its people, Russian or otherwise. It would be an Empire in which he would be proud to see his daughter grow.\n\nAs the Tsar thought of that future, however, he also thought of his past. Of the dark days of collaboration. Of decisions made in error. Of the many questions he had asked himself. And he found that he was closer than ever to answering many of them. The Empire had a long way to go, and he had an ever longer road to follow. But he would walk that road, head held high.\n\nVladimir stood, and as he did so, he saw the drawer. He suddenly realized that he had not taken a pill in many days, and realized further that he did not need to.\n\nThe migraines did not come anymore."

It has always been my dearest wish to serve among the monarchy of Russia as a high nobleman, and it has been among my life struggle. I will pledge my eternal loyalty to you in return for thy lordship. I will also pledge that Omsk will be transformed into the most prosperous in the Tsardom under my rule, and you will see the great bounties of my leadership.\n\nI do request that you remember my servitude for you while you deliberate this decision, and recall how loyal I was to you in times of struggle. If you grace me with your greatness I will surely pay it back in full.\n\nYour esteemed Chief Foreign Minister, Former Prince of Andorra, Former Count of Orange, Baron Boris Mikhailovitx Skossyrevv-Mavrusov."

 vyatkasuper.19.desc:0 "We have received news that our Chief Foreign Officer Boris Skossyrev, sent to the United States on a regular diplomatic mission to the country, has been arrested by US Agents in the airport on his way to return to Russia. Arrested for attempting to smuggle drugs out of the country, he is currently being held in an American jail. One of his assistants has reported back to us saying "he just wanted to have a good time."\n\nSent to further relations with the United States and the rest of the OFN, it appears Boris may not be doing his job that well. We have further reports that Boris spends most of his time parting in America and not actually doing his job. Reportedly, he spends most of his time partying in the states and going to nightclubs. But at this point, what else should we expect.\n\nIt will be costly to get him out of the country free of any charges, but we should have enough good dealings with the US to get him out with only a monetary price. Some of our ministers are saying that we should just leave him there, as he is more of a hindrance than anything. Vladimir III has decided however he will be brought back to Russia. Maybe he even learned something this time?"

 vyatkasuper.20.desc:0 "The memories of the Russian Empire had been ones of absolute powers centralized in the hands of the Tsar, a dutiful ruler dedicated to his people, a sort of parent figure.\n\nAt least it was how some people remembered it to be, or how they were taught to think as such, cases like Tsar Vladimir Romanov, a man born after the fall of Autocracy, one that was still clinging on the idea of the Tsar being a powerful ruler dutifully working for his people's betterment. Yet, that idea was being challenged by Gul and his reforms that ever transformed the Russian monarchy into a constitutional one.\n\nThe Tsar and his Prime Minister were both sat on an Imperial styled couch that Vladimir had come into possession of, a memento of sort of a bygone era that he'd never come to know personally. He'd arranged a meeting with Gul on the matter of privileges accorded to the Tsar's family and himself, as fears of those being reduced, if not outright removed, started to plague Vladimir in the last few days.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty, I understand that you fear seeing your royal privileges be taken away, especially as powers that once were yours until recent reforms are taken away to alleviate Your Majesty's shoulders. However, I can assure you that they shan't be taken away in any circumstance, as you remain the Tsar first and foremost, but also because you are a symbol to the people."\n\nVladimir listened with great attention, nodding to Gul's reassurances while a small weight was being lifted off his chest. Perhaps the Prime Minister had not been entirely honest with him and only time would tell if that was the case, but in this instant Vladimir had for the most part utmost confidence in Gul's words."
