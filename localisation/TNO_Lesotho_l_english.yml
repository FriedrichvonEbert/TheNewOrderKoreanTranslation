POLITICS_MOSHOESHOE_II_DESC:0 "King of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Moshoeshoe II was born Constantine Bereng Seeiso, a descendant of Moshoeshoe I, the great founder of the nation. Educated at Roma College in Lesotho, from a young age he cooperated closely with the South African government, just as his stepmother, acting as his regent in the wake of his father’s death, had before him. Granted full independence upon assuming the throne in 1960, he has so far competently led Lesotho in cooperation with the constitutional government."
