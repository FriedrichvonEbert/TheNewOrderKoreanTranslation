UNITA와 MPLA는 미국 점령에 협조적이고 도움이 되었습니다. 독일과 서로를 상대로 그들만의 영토를 확보했습니다. 하지만, 휴전이 오랫동안 지속될 수 없는 미군 주둔 기간만큼만 유지될 것이라는 것은 명백합니다. 앙골라 파벌과 의회의 과대평가된 기대치를 모두 무너뜨린 라벨은 앙골라의 잠재력을 최대한 발휘하기 위해 모든 외교적 기술을 동원해야 할 것입니다."

Air Force General Lavelle would be the one overlooking OFN Angola and there is no doubt that the work ahead of him will be a difficult one and arduous. The airfields were prime USAF targets, as Lavelle himself could attest, and would require significant efforts to bring online. As of now, there are many unknowns down on the ground. General Lavelle hopes to hit the ground running and to quickly get on with it. The administration and the American people are watching."

 OFN_ANG_the_sudwestafrikaner_secret_desc:0 "Our forces have been inspecting the former RK for resources and assessing the sort of damage done to the region. Notably, our forces have managed to secure Schenck's former residence and headquarters. A quick review of his archives have revealed that Schenck had been working with the rebels in secret. The documents outline something of an "Angolan Plan" through economic and military development. It is advised that General Lavelle ought to see these documents in person due to the sensitive and controversial nature of their contents."
 OFN_ANG_contacting_unita:0 "Contacting UNITA"
 OFN_ANG_contacting_unita_desc:0 "Foremost in Schenck's plans was Jonas Savimbi. CIA contacts have listed him as a capable rebel leader in Angola. Despite having certain goals in opposition of OFN objectives in the region, he and UNITA seem to have the necessary competence and popularity to bring stability and strength to the region. We have arranged a meeting between Lavelle and Savimbi to negotiate the possibility of collaboration and support for one another."
 OFN_ANG_study_the_plans:0 "Study the Plans"
 OFN_ANG_study_the_plans_desc:0 "Military intelligence analysts can at least conclude that Schenck was serious about his Angolan Plan. He drew up everything: contingencies in case of discovery, economic plans to industrialize, and even took steps to develop a bureaucracy to outlast his eventual departure. We are still trying to evaluate the viability of his plans but one thing is certain: the other Mandates do not have the head start that we do. These plans were designed with the natives in mind but he lacked the resources. In our preliminary reading, with the backing of the United States, they very well can become a reality. If the United States has the will to shell out the necessary funding, we would truly have a chance to rebuild this nation from the ground up."
 OFN_ANG_contacting_the_mpla:0 "Contacting the MPLA"
 OFN_ANG_contacting_the_mpla_desc:0 "During the South African War, the MPLA were mostly in the background compared to UNITA. Their membership was low and had barely a partisan presence compared to Savimbi's men. However, times are changing. Their Marxist-Leninist rhetoric is gaining more and more followers. Thus, we have arranged a meeting between Agostihno Neto and General Lavelle for the purposes of discussing collaboration and the future of Angola."

 OFN_ANG_picking_up_where_he_left_it_desc:0 "We can delay it no longer. We have evaluated most of Schenck's archives and we must make a decision: either act or to bury the archive. The optics do not look good. Any administration would no doubt raise up a fuss or even an investigation should they realize that the extent of our nation building exercise is based upon the foundations of a card carrying Nazi. It would be up to Lavelle for how transparent we wish to be with the administration. In any case, it would be an utter waste to bury Schenck's plans. We would be no different than the rest of the Mandates: get in, get the resources, get out. General Lavelle has so far taken a wait and see approach to what must be done but the plans seem that, though ambitious, could very well be a reality in a few years. OFN Angola could very well be the only Mandate that leaves the continent with a stable state when we depart."
 OFN_ANG_training_the_natives:0 "Training the Natives"
 OFN_ANG_training_the_natives_desc:0 "One of the first objectives of a proper stable nation state is security. Angola's "armed forces" are in a sorry state. They were disciplined enough for insurgent operations but it's far easier to harass the enemy than to protect a nation. General Lavelle sees this as the next obstacle preventing a stable Angola and has thus delegated the role to General William William W. Momyer. Although he is a tough man to work with at times, he would surely do a great job to improve Angola's security situation."
 OFN_ANG_meet_with_savimbi:0 "Meet with Savimbi"
 OFN_ANG_meet_with_savimbi_desc:0 "The future of Angola comes to the forefront once again. Of course, Lavelle plans to talk to Jonas Savimbi. Officially, the meeting would be about policy but Lavelle is also probing for his view on the future of Angola. Savimbi is a fighting man but isn't that what Angola needs nowadays? Even now, the country is not yet ready for democracy with the instability and poverty of the region. Perhaps a strong hand will be needed to guide Angola towards a brighter future."

 OFN_ANG_arming_the_warlords_desc:0 "The situation is unstable. Given America's increasing displeasure at troops on the ground, we are tasked with trying to make it work with what limited manpower at our disposal. As of now, we're looking at any number of Nazi holdouts, partisans who haven't come in from the cold, and the general decline of the security situation beyond the cities - and even within the cities. We're simply stretched too thin.\n\nIn order to turn around the rapidly declining situation, General Lavelle has authorized weapon shipments to both UNITA and the MPLA. Given that the administration has tasked us with stabilizing and rebuilding Angola, these orders really aren't that out of scope. We're not the only players in town. The weapons are for Savimbi and Neto to properly start securing the country for Angolans."
 OFN_ANG_establishing_a_native_army:0 "Establishing a Native Army"
 OFN_ANG_establishing_a_native_army_desc:0 "Although the training has been going well, militia units are not ideal for the security of an entire nation. A nation needs an army which is why General Lavelle has formally authorized the creation of the Angolan Armed Forces (AAF). To curry some favor with Savimbi and UNITA, we have selected Commander Demosthenes Amos Chilingutila to head this new organization. A grizzled veteran from years of resistance under the Nazi RK, we are sure that he would do an excellent job."
 OFN_ANG_discuss_with_neto:0 "Discuss with Neto"
 OFN_ANG_discuss_with_neto_desc:0 "Between reforming the military and playing referee between UNITA and the MPLA, today it seems that General Lavelle is geared for the latter. We're looking at a nice meeting between Agostinho Neto and Lavelle, this time focused on policy. Our diplomacy experts have drafted up a few talking points regarding the future of Angola to clarify some of his positions. To be fair, there's a few things we could already guess at: he is perhaps the greatest socialist voice in Angola nowadays. We're hoping that his ideological popularity could translate into some semblance of stability for the budding nation."

 OFN_ANG_consolidate_an_army_desc:0 "The local 'militias' in Angola are far more organized and well-equipped than their compatriots across much of the former Reichskommissariats - capable of operating as a larger, conventional force instead of being an irregular force of guerilla infantry. It is a promising foundation for a unified Angolan military - and under OFN guidance and with American weapons, the Angolan armed forces will become the backbone for the new Angolan state."
 OFN_ANG_heal_the_scars:0 "Heal the Scars"
 OFN_ANG_heal_the_scars_desc:0 "Even if the South African War has ended for the soldiers, the civilians have to live in the artillery moonscapes and minefields left behind. No new Angolan state or people can reasonably flourish in a country that still bears the scars of the last war, and we must make rebuilding Angola's shattered economy and infrastructure a priority if we are to leave behind a functioning state."
 OFN_ANG_clean_the_battlefields:0 "Clean the Battlefields"
 OFN_ANG_clean_the_battlefields_desc:0 "No person knows better than General Lavelle the aftermath of his strategic bombing campaign. Conventional ground warfare on the ground has not helped the situation either. There is a massive crisis of unexploded ordnance. Before we even consider land reform for agriculture, industry, or infrastructure, these places must be cleared out and secured. Everything from unexploded cluster munitions to artillery duds must be painstakingly disposed of. Some of our staff have been tasked with marking out the more important areas to clear out first. Others have begun contacting proper explosive disposal experts and begin training the natives for the task. There is no doubt that the region would struggle with the "iron harvest" for generations later but we must get started today."
 OFN_ANG_rebuilding_industrial_infrastructure:0 "Rebuilding Industrial Infrastructure"
 OFN_ANG_rebuilding_industrial_infrastructure_desc:0 "The beating heart of a country is its industrial capacity - measured not only in terms of factories, but in the technology and distribution networks that allow economies of scale and mass mobilization of resources across vast geographies. Angola is blessed with natural resources, but what industry remains after the war is antiquated and small in scale. Bringing Angola's economy up to its full potential will require a considerable investment of time and effort, but will surely pay dividends later - to the Angolan people, and to their OFN backers..."
 OFN_ANG_communication_across_the_south_west:0 "Communication Across the Southwest"
 OFN_ANG_communication_across_the_south_west_desc:0 "It's frankly a miracle that Reichskommissar Schenck's abortive plan for a revolution got off the ground - beyond a central line of communication between Windhoek and Leopoldville, there are hardly any telephone linkages between Angola's various cities and villages, with couriers still the most reliable method of transporting messages through the country. But for Angola to join the modern world, and to ensure that the Angolan government can keep tabs on the pulse of its people, we must build out a modern telecommunications infrastructure for the country."
 OFN_ANG_nujomas_government:0 "A Graceful Exit for Nujoma's Government"
 OFN_ANG_nujomas_government_desc:0 "The question of Sam Nujoma's "Namibian Government-in-exile" wasn't one that General Lavelle had planned to answer. Revolutionary in outlook and opposed to South African rule, the organization poses a direct challenge to the OFN mission in Africa. While it is unpalatable to our leadership, however, it's popular locally, and an outright condemnation could do real damage to our own standing. For this reason, we've conveniently considered the organization outside of the remit of our Mandate up until now.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not to last. The close ties between the Nujoma and the Angolan MPLA are increasingly forcing the issue, and it seems we will have to take a stance."
 OFN_ANG_rebuild_the_infrastructures:0 "Rebuild the Infrastructures"
 OFN_ANG_rebuild_the_infrastructures_desc:0 "Although the road network in Angola was never very well developed, it was still targeted extensively during the war. The current state of the network is a major hindrance to our operations in the Mandate, and the widespread destruction has put a stop to communication, transportation, and trade and left the towns and villages of Angola isolated.\n\nThis state of affairs needs changing. A rebuilt road network will cement our Mandate, strengthen our operations, and show the natives we mean business. It's time to get to work."

 OFN_ANG_the_south_west_african_reconstruction_program_desc:0 "Much of the Angolan economy was owned and operated by the RK directly, and has now fallen into our hands. Now that we've taken full stock of the industries we found ourselves in charge of, it is time to set in motion Lavelle's plan for their future.\n\nWe will ignore the voices from home calling for their privatization, and instead keep ownership of the enterprises. Through the "Angolan Reconstruction Program", we will then direct their proceeds to development projects across the Mandate, clearly demonstrating our good intentions to its populace."
 OFN_ANG_reconnect_the_cities:0 "Reconnect the Cities"
 OFN_ANG_reconnect_the_cities_desc:0 "As our drive to rebuild the infrastructure of Angola goes on, the country is slowly being weaved back together. While this is a great boon to most of the population, it's also causing tensions in some quarters. Towns and cities getting back in contact also means prices converging and new goods entering markets, triggering complaints and protests from the merchants and craftsmen that are undercut.\n\nWe must make it clear that nothing will come of such protests. The cities of Angola must be always willing to talk with one another, work with one another, and trade with one another. For the benefit of all. It's time to unify their administration."
 OFN_ANG_restart_the_factories:0 "Restart the Factories"
 OFN_ANG_restart_the_factories_desc:0 "Our efforts to reconnect Angola are starting to bear fruit. As the road network expands, goods and people are moving again. Town by town, village by village, Angola is waking up.\n\nThe next step for the country is to get back to work. Now that their access to inputs, labour, and markets is restored, it is time to reopen the factories."
 OFN_ANG_hire_the_natives:0 "Hire the Natives"
 OFN_ANG_hire_the_natives_desc:0 "The purpose of our industries is not only to secure an economic base, but also to provide a stable source of employment for the natives. Now that they're up and running, we should start a drive to hire natives to as many positions as possible.\n\nThese jobs will provide a source of stable income and employment to Angolans. The workers can then go on to spend those incomes purchasing goods from local traders and craftsmen, uplifting the whole economy."
 OFN_ANG_create_an_industrial_foundation:0 "Create an Industrial Foundation"
 OFN_ANG_create_an_industrial_foundation_desc:0 "Prosperity is not achieved overnight, and never haphazardly. An advanced economy relies on connections.

 OFN_ANG_stabilize_the_industry:0 "Stabilize the Industry"
 OFN_ANG_stabilize_the_industry_desc:0 "While the Angolan industry is now up and running and providing jobs and goods to her populace, it is still reliant on our support and know-how. To fully stand on its own feet, Angola needs a domestic knowledge base, both for management and workers. Trade schools and colleges will build that knowledge base, while on the job training and a commitment to sound management will ensure all the progress made is retained. We will stabilize the Angolan industry, so that it can serve the country for decades to come."

 OFN_ANG_the_luanda_office_desc:0 "The work of rebuilding Angola will require more than money and construction in the here and now, but also a comprehensive plan to restructure and establish a sound Angolan state and economy.

We will correct these mistakes with the free debate and deliberations only possible in the free world."
 OFN_ANG_administrative_rework:0 "Administrative Reworks"
 OFN_ANG_administrative_rework_desc:0 "The old administrative apparatus of Angola was fully borrowed from the former Portuguese colonial regime - bare bones, under resourced, and reliant on colonial administrators while leaving the local population with no participation in their own governance.

 OFN_ANG_dierks_proposal_desc:0 "The landscape of Angola is vast and rugged, with miles between population centers with substandard infrastructure. Klaus Dierks, our principal economic advisor, notes that even with our planned improvements to communications and transport infrastructure, it could still take days to move between major population centers without relying on ruinously expensive air transport. He proposes that we decentralize political decision making authority to individual states and municipal authorities. The plan isn't the most popular - our OFN colleagues already have enough trouble negotiating with different arms of the central government - but in order to leave a functioning government behind, it might not be the worst plan."
 OFN_ANG_fix_schencks_mistakes:0 "Fix Schenck's Mistakes"
 OFN_ANG_fix_schencks_mistakes_desc:0 "Wolfgang Schenck, for all of his good intentions, had to work in intense secrecy. He may have dreamt of a free Angola, bringing notables and partisan movements together with the resources he could command, but throughout it all he had to plan for eventual resistance - from German loyalists, from collaborators, from militias keeping their home safe from an incipient civil war. But the OFN operates with a mandate from the people and the international community - to prepare Angola for independence. And if we expect the Angolan people to come willingly on the journey to freedom, they all need to be kept informed, every step of the way."

 OFN_ANG_the_leap_of_faith_desc:0 "The time for decolonization has finally come. What Schenck dreamt of in secrecy, we are now on the doorstep of accomplishing - a free Angola, joining the brotherhood of free nations.\n\nWe can only hope that our efforts to midwife this transition - building infrastructure, laying out a new economy, bringing the various factions together - will be enough to ensure that after we leave, Angola can stand on its own two feet."

 OFN_ANG_setting_up_the_transitional_governance_desc:0 "With decolonization within our sights, we need to address the issue of who leads the future Angolan government. Though we've done our best to make sure all factions are included in the political process, only one can stand above the rest to lead Angola into its new future.\n\nWashington would like to see a future Angolan government friendly to American interests - and other partners in the transition process would much rather see Angola free to determine all aspects of its future policy. The discussion revolves around Jonas Savinbi and Agostinho Neho - and all that remains is to choose who holds the reins of power once we leave. To the others, well, they'll have to figure it out on their own."
 OFN_ANG_balance_the_south_west:0 "Balance the Southwest"
 OFN_ANG_balance_the_south_west_desc:0 "It turns out Wolfgang Schenck didn't organize his push for a free Angolan state through idealism alone. The financial books of the former Sudwestafrikan government are completely and utterly fraudulent - a vast web of overreported performance and inflated requisition requests to fool Germany's bureaucrats while building the foundations of the future Angola.\n\nUnfortunately, Schenck's gambit has left us with a serious problem - namely, that the economic records of the Sudwestafrikan government are useless to us. We will essentially be forced to rebuild the Angolan economy from the ground up while blindfolded - and if our plans to rebuild Angola are to succeed, this must be rectified immediately."

The biggest one, §GUNITA§!, is a democratic movement, led by a commander that can't decide between being a freedom fighter and a militaristic warlord, §GJonas Savimbi§!. He is extremely charismatic, and has managed to get most of the attention abroad. A more discreet, but still fierce, movement is the §SMPLA§!, led by §SAgostinho Neto§!.

Expect more soon." stated Lopez, saluting as he promptly left the room. Diverting his eyes away from the view outside, General Lavelle stared at the document curiously. While he had helped many like it before, this one's condition was not great. With worn edges and a torn cover, it had suffered some mismanagement. Yet, one thing remained the same throughout each folder. Emblazoned on it was the logo of an eagle and shield, surrounding it the words "Central Intelligence Agency."\n\nShifting through the files, Lavelle read each one meticulously. There was only so much they could scrape together, whether acquired from cooperation with UNITA, or dug up from the old Reichskommisariat's archives. Piecing them together however, painted a grim picture of Angola and its people. Reports of UNITA and MPLA guerillas engaging one another, dossiers containing locations of potential Nazi holdouts, and land surveys expressing the unprecedented amount of destruction the South African War had brought upon the geography and infrastructure. Lavelle was stunned at the information. He and the rest of the Luanda Office committee had only arrived a few days prior, yet they'd already been served a large plate of problems to deal with.\n\nShutting the folder, Lavelle rose from his chair and observed the scenery outside. Laying before him was the battered city of Luanda, slowly recovering from its near destruction during the war. Further out was the bay, and by extension, the insurmountable Atlantic. And just like the ocean itself, Lavelle thought, Angola's problems were vast and without end in sight."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.2.t:0 "The Klaus Dierks Report"
 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.2.desc:0 "Going over the papers before him one last time, Klaus Dierks's smile grew wider and wider as he saw his plans finally coming together. Angola was a very disconnected country, having never had much infrastructure in the first place except where necessary to extract resources, a fact that was worsened by all those years of abuse at Nazi hands. With this rural nature in mind, as well as the very diverse cultural makeup of the country, he had developed a plan to overcome that and ease administration for any central government: decentralization.\n\nWhile he had first had this idea for Namibia, with only a few modifications he had made it workable for Angola as well. While his critics with their incessant jealousy might disagree, saying that he was 'placing too much confidence in a single plan' and 'endangering the mandate', he knew that this would only bring prosperity for Angolans. Gathering his papers, he got up to go and present the report."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.3.t:0 "The Compromise for Angola"
 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.3.desc:0 "In the end, the result of the Luanda Conference had been something few had much faith in: a compromise.\n\nNeither UNITA nor the MPLA held significant power over the other, and the new government was intended to be one where both forces would work together equally. To many, however, and in particular to one General William M. Momyer, this was a solution that was clearly never going to work.\n\n"There must be some mistake, sir." He asked his direct superior, John D. Lavalle. "You and I both know that as soon as we leave, this agreement will break down. We'll never find a leader acceptable to both sides, and the differences between the factions are-"\n\n"Impossible to resolve? Yes, I'm aware of this, but what would you have me do? Tear up that whole agreement and tell them to start from scratch? That'd only make things worse!" Lavalle sighed, his head in his hands. Momyer had never been a very vocal man when it came to what he thought. If the situation was bad enough to push even him to bring this up to Lavalle, then the future here was bleak indeed. "It's all we can ask that the peace be kept until we withdraw."\n\nAs silence fell upon the two of them for a moment, Momyer looked unconvinced. Lavalle couldn't blame him; he hadn't even convinced himself. "I just hope you know what you're doing, sir."\n\nAs the door slammed shut behind his subordinate, Lavelle let out a long, tired sigh. Did he know what he was doing? What a question."

The one speaking was named Henrique, a burly man nearing middle age. "They don't plan to choose leave this country, the bastards."\n\nThe man next to him, Alberto, a muscular young man with an oddly gentle smile, raised an eyebrow. "Isn't the fact that you can say that openly proof that the Americans are better than the Germans?"\n\nIn response, Henrique rolled his eyes, as if even asking that was ridiculous. "Bah! There's no such thing as a better master when you're the slave. There might be ones who act nice, but in the end they're all the same." He waved over to the bartender. "Hey, Ernesto! Another round of drinks for me and my friend here."\n\nThat made Alberto chuckle; Henrique was as lively as ever. "You might be right, my friend. They say they came here to protect the peace, but the longer they stay here, the more I wonder what peace they're here to protect."\n\n"Whatever peace makes them money!" Rafael, an older worker close to retirement spoke up. "That's what it always is with these outsiders. Isn't that right, Henrique?"\n\n"You're damn right," Henrique agreed, sipping his beer. "It's always about their profits.""

The African heat didn't take kindly to foreigners, making it hell for the two unfortunate men. "How long do we have to keep relaying the message for, you reckon?" asked Hudson, wiping away his profuse sweat.\n\n"Until we get a response." stated Rodriguez, walking over to the radio. Manning it, he twisted its knobs and adjusted the frequency, listening closely for any response other than pure silence. "Still nothing." Rodriguez noted, lighting a cigarette as he shook his head begrudgingly.\n\n"That was the..." started Hudson as he counted silently, "tenth time we've looped the broadcast? I hope these UNITA folks res-"\n\n"Pipe it, I'm picking up something." said Rodriguez, placing his ear closer to the radio. "Get Mr. Dierks on the line, now."\n\nIn his office, Klaus Dierks sat around hopelessly. He'd hoped to engage in talks with UNITA, but as each day passed with no word from or about them, his opportunity to do so waned. Suddenly, his deskside phone rang. Dierks picked it up lazily, expecting another mundane check by Lavelle or a local administrator's report. What he was greeted by however, was a man's gruff voice, his speech bombastic as he spoke over the line. Dierks couldn't help but grin."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.6.t:0 "The MPLA Connection"
 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.6.desc:0 "It had been several days since the letter was sent, and still there was no response. When the OFN initially attempted to contact the MPLA in order to begin talks with them, it had not taken them very long to find them. What was much more difficult was convincing them to accept working with, rather than against, the OFN. As such, Lavelle had personally written a letter to Neto, detailing his vision of a free Angola where nobody would decide the direction the country took except for Angolans themselves, and how this could best be accomplished through cooperation between the OFN and the MPLA.\n\nNow, after so much time had passed, more than enough for a response to be written, sent, and received, Lavelle was almost ready to give up on the idea of cooperating with them, and prepare for conflict instead. Before he could finally decide on this new course of action, however, an aide ran up to him with a letter in hand, offering a quick salute over an excited face. "He finally replied sir! Agostinho Neto!"\n\nTaking the letter from his aide with a grin, Lavelle opened it up to read its contents.\n\n"To General Lavelle,\n\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. After some consideration, I have decided to accept cooperation with and help from the OFN. However, as a precaution, this agreement will only be maintained to a limited extent.\n\nSincerely, Agostinho Neto\n\nWhile it hadn't been to the extent that he'd wanted, just the fact that he wouldn't have to fight the MPLA every step of the way was quite a relief."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.7.desc:0 "Staring out of the window of his office and seeing the city of Luanda below, Lavelle thought about the situation Angola now found itself in. Although repairs were still incomplete and the fragility of the current politics, every minute that the OFN remained on Angolan soil only further broke down the peace that had been delicately built in the country, and so it had been decided at long last for the Mandate to end and the troops to return home. Before they could, however, there remained something that Lavelle needed to accomplish.\n\nThe Luanda Conference.\n\nThere, the near political future of the country would be discussed, decided, and agreed upon. Lavelle had more than his fair share of doubts about what this would accomplish, given how polarized the people were, and it left a sour taste in his mouth not seeing the reconstruction through to the end, but it was time to take a leap of faith and see what happened."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.8.desc:0 "In an American military camp near Luanda, officers were gathered around a table inside of a tent, two of them standing out from the rest for their heterodox uniforms. Each of the two stood at one end of the table, which served as a divide between them. They were Iko Carreira of the MPLA, and Demosthenes Amos Chilingutila of UNITA, for once working together and not against each other, in order to establish a national army for Angola, from Angola. "I think that is everything we needed to talk about." Carreira told the assembled officers.\n\n"No. Not everything." Chilingutila shook his head and stared at Carreira, as if looking for a reaction. "We still haven't decided how the command will operate. We keep putting it off, but it must be said for this army to function. I still say that officers must be close to their men, not far away and ignorant. Local, autonomous command is our best option."\n\n"Are you some sort of idiot?" Carreira asked, and Chilingutila bristled. "Without a powerful centralized command, our army will fall apart in the heat of battle. What you are suggesting isn't fit for little children, let alone a modern army."\n\nChilingutila clenched his fists and glowered at Carreira, but did not raise his voice when he next spoke. "You would have men be mere puppets, incapable of action on their own and falling over from a gust of wind." After a moment of rising tension, they both started to glance at the increasingly nervous American officers in the tent.\n\n"What do you all think?" Carreira asked. Despite some initial hesitation, none objected when one of them gave the opinion they had been convinced of by one of the two men."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.9.t:0 "A Meeting with Jonas Savimbi"
 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.9.desc:0 "It had been quite a journey, but Lavelle had finally reached UNITA's inland headquarters, where he had been told to go after asking to meet with Jonas Savimbi. Being escorted by UNITA members to the man near the center of the camp, Lavelle found him looking over some papers, in a chair facing a table underneath a tarp, with another chair on the opposite side of the table. "The general is here to see you, commander." One of Lavelle's UNITA escorts announced\n\nThat made Savimbi look up from his work, and he smiled at Lavelle, though it didn't seem sincere. "Ah, yes. Please, come have a seat." After the escorts gave a crisp, admirable salute and Lavelle took the other chair, Savimbi continued. "What did you need, General Lavelle?"\n\n"I was hoping to ask for your full support in the transition to Angolan democracy." Lavelle replied honestly, while studying Savimbi's face for a reaction.\n\n"Democracy! Of course, I will spare no effort to see it through." Savimbi grinned endearingly, and Lavelle began to realize why so many men were willing to fight for him. "Though, if you don't mind my saying so, I have some plans of my own to make this democracy more effective, so that when I take control-"\n\n"You mean when Angolans take control?"\n\nThat made Savimbi pause for a moment. "Yes, that. My plans would make for a more peaceful democracy."\n\n"I see, send them to me and I'll be sure to take a look." Lavelle found he meant it, too, even if he didn't know how useful they'd be. "That aside, it was a pleasure to meet you, Mr Savimbi, but I must be leaving now, for the sake of the reconstruction effort." Upon leaving the camp, Lavelle couldn't help but wonder how, for all his supposed love of democracy, a man as prideful as Savimbi could keep the country both free and functional."

 OFN_ANG_FOCUS.10.desc:0 "After reaching out to the MPLA about having a talk with Neto, they had directed him to Neto's current headquarters, a simple home just on the outskirts of Luanda. After Lavelle knocked on the door three times, the door was finally opened by one of Neto's aides, who directed him to the living room with a smile. Well, at least this friendliness was a good sign, Lavelle thought. Walking into the living room, he saw Neto himself for the first time, a plain looking middle-aged man wearing glasses, sitting on an old couch in the living room. Not at all what Lavelle had expected.\n\nLooking up when Lavelle walked in, Neto grinned and pointed to the seat beside him. "Please, come and sit." He told Lavelle. When Lavelle did so, Neto nodded to himself as though he was pleased, and continued. "I hear you seek my cooperation, General Lavelle?"\n\n"You are well informed; that's exactly right." Lavelle replied with mild surprise.\n\n"It is yours for now, I assure you. Though, if I sense you are acting against the interests of the Angolan people in general, I cannot promise that this cooperation will continue. Is that clear?"\n\nBy 'the Angolan people in general', he most likely meant the MPLA in particular. "Yes, that is acceptable." Lavelle answered, wisely choosing not to give voice to his thoughts.\n\n"If I may say one more thing, I am very thankful for the reconstruction efforts of the OFN. You are providing a great place for the growth of socialism, and you sincerely have my gratitude for that." Neto patted Lavelle on the back and again flashed his grin, though the general couldn't help but feel that Savimbi, too, was biting his tongue.\n\nAs he finally left his short, but fruitful meeting with Neto, Lavelle wondered how a man so devoted to the socialist cause, even if so clearly humble, could hope to resolve the Angolan tensions without violence."

"What... is this...?"\n\nIt would seem that Wolfgang Schenk had been fighting for the same cause as them this whole time: the liberation of Angola. Even high in the ranks of the Reich, it seemed that the Reichskommissar had been a deeply troubled man, and subverted the will of his superiors wherever he thought he could. Though it was far from making up for all the services he had performed for the campaigns of German conquest and subjugation, it seemed that somewhere in Schenk's heart lived some honor.\n\nBefore, the plan for the Mandate had only been the reconstruction and preparation for independence of the liberated territories. Now, Lavelle realized there was a need to go further, to realize Schenk's plans. A new, national Angolan army would have to be created, trained, and equipped to deal with any threats to the peace or danger to its independence. There were risks to this idea, both in Africa and back home, but Lavelle knew that if he let this opportunity slip away, it would haunt him forevermore."

"Ah, Mr Dierks. Please, come in." He told him quickly with a thin smile. "What brings you to my office today? Is something the matter?"\n\n"Nothing's the matter, sir." Dierks replied. "That is, nothing that can't be solved without much trouble." Having entered, he closed the door behind him, making it difficult for others to listen in on their conversation. "The issue is the southern border, with the Namibian refugees there. The government-in-exile of the Namibians, the one led by Nujoma, wields great influence among them, and they're beginning to become... troublesome."\n\nHis smile becoming a frown, Lavelle's brow furrowed. "How so?"\n\n"Nujoma's government is closely allied to the MPLA, so these refugees could disrupt the balance of power within Angola, as well as cause trouble for the South Africans. As you know, High Command refuses to recognize Nujoma as a legitimate leader, so we're left with two options." Dierks cleared his throat nervously, and Lavelle immediately knew neither option was going to be appealing. "We can stand by the position of the OFN and deal with it ourselves, or we can... pass the issue to South Africa. The choice is yours, sir."\n\nAfter a moment of weighing two bad choices against each other, Lavelle finally decided."

Joe remarked.

Adalberto replied.\n\n"So why are they fighting? Is it just that there's only room enough for one ass in the big chair, and Jonas Savimbi and Agostinho Neto both want that ass to be theirs?"\n\nAdalberto let out a brief chuckle. "Yes, that's certainly a contributing factor, but despite the similar name, MLPA and UNITA both have very different visions for a liberated Angola.  UNITA is what you Americans call a 'big tent' party, containing both authoritarian and democratic factions, held together by the charisma of Jonas Savimbi. MLPA, on the other hand, is a more ideologically unified centrist party. Despite having fewer supporters and less international attention than UNITA, MLPA controls most of the cities, and has better leadership overall, so it manages to hold its own."\n\n"Hmmmm... I hope they'll be able to work something out by the time we leave." Joe said, hand on his chin.\n\n"I doubt it."
