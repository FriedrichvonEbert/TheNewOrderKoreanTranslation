#Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_Abd_al_Karim_Qasim_DESC:0 "During his tenure as prime minister of the Republic of Iraq, Abd al-Karim Qasim has earned the title of al-Za'im, the Leader, and even his numerous enemies have to recognize that it is well deserved. Born into a mixed Sunni and Shiite family, Qasim took quickly to the military, serving as a rebel officer during the Anglo-Iraqi War. During the conflict, Qasim became known for his charisma and cunning as a leader, soon rising through the ranks of the Iraqi army and creating a network of allies among the rising pan-Arabist cliques. At the same time, he kept up good relations with the Italian occupiers, careful to work with both camps while truly belonging to neither.\n\nThe unpopular Golden Square puppet regime was finally toppled by the revolution of July 14th, 1958. Qasim established him as a "moderate" and "reasonable" voice of the revolution, and maintained his Italian contacts throughout. The revolutionaries had grand projects of pan-Arab unity and a broad revolt against Italian imperialism - projects which clearly became doomed as the many different factions turned to infighting and the grand army of Fascism gathered on Iraq's borders. Qasim led a military revolt against both sides, and opened negotiations with Rome, through which he was allowed to remain as prime minister of an independent and republican Iraq in exchange for allowing a small Italian garrison and renouncing all dreams of Arab unity - a deal which Qasim was more than happy to take.\n\nFrom there on, Qasim began shaping Iraq in his vision. Pushing progressive and reformist policies, the new prime minister began to carry out land reform, social reform and education campaigns, with the goal of bringing Iraq into the modern age as a modern nation, even if one watched by Italy.  Though bold, his reforms have also been cautious, for fear of provoking the many enemies and false friends which wait in the shadows. And they are numerous indeed - Ba'athists and Nasserists which Qasim once betrayed and perhaps others, even more insidious, wait in the shadows, plotting and scheming the downfall of the al-Za'im."

#Ideas
 IRQ_july_14_legacy:0 "Legacy of July 14th"
 IRQ_july_14_legacy_desc:0 "It has been almost 5 years since the 14th July Revolution, and in many ways it remains unfinished. The revolution began as a popular and widespread uprising against Italian Influence, but rapidly devolved into anarchy, a war of all against all. Communists fought Shiites, democrats fought militarists, and everyone fought the Ba'athists. It was only the military coup of general Abd al-Karim Qasim and the forging of his government of national consensus that brought an end to the fighting. Since then, Qasim has been recognized by every party as Iraq's leader, but not a very powerful one. His rule is based on consensus, that the nation's factitious political parties are individually too weak to unite against him, and that the Italians will be forever desperate to support his regime as a bulwark against German-backed Ba'athism."

 IRQ_dawa_ascendant:0 "Dawa Ascendant"
 IRQ_dawa_ascendant_desc:0 "Much of the political scene in Iraq has been constant for decades. A weak puppet government supported by a foreign power. Pan-Arabists, numerous in their support but opposed by all others. Old men doddering about democracy, young men preaching communism. Opportunists and corruption in the army (and everywhere else). However, inspired by Iraq's economic stagnation and the oppression (both real and perceived) of their faith across the Middle East, Iraq's Shiites are flocking in ever greater numbers to join the Islamist Dawa Party, founded to represent them and their greivances. While the party itself is far from united, its star continues to rise even as Iraq's stability remains questionable, and few can doubt it's not a force to be reckoned with."
 
 IRQ_italian_interference:0 "Italian Interference"
 IRQ_italian_interference_desc:0 "While, on paper, Iraq is arguably the most independent nation of the Italian sphere, in reality the nation remains heavily dependent on its patrons in Rome. Iraq's oil is extracted by the Italians, its army is augmented and trained by Italian advisors, and its politics hampered by humiliating treaties which keep the nation limp wristed and dependent. While politicians of every stripe decry their nation's persistent servility, too many of them benefit too much from Italalian patronage and corruption to do much about it."

 IRQ_ineffecient_oil_industry:0 "Ineffecient Oil Industry"
 IRQ_ineffecient_oil_industry_desc:0 "One would think that the discovery of massive oil reserves would lead to some sort of economic improvement. One would be surprised then, if they visited Iraq. Although Iraq's deserts are home to towering oil fields and its cities stuffed with refineries for th eblack gold, its actual production remains under par. What oil is produced is often stolen and sold on the black market, or lost somewhere in Iraq's maze of bureaucracy, cronyism, and pollution. If, against all odds, a barral actually makes it to shipment, the money will mostly go to the Italians who ship it. Should a spare coin or two find its way back into the nation of its inception, then it will quickly go to line the pockets of the political or economic elite rather than into the hands of anyone who actually found the oil, extracted it, or worked to purify it."

 IRQ_the_spectre_of_baathism:0 "The Spectre of Ba'athism"
 IRQ_the_spectre_of_baathism_desc:0 "As elsewhere in the region, Iraq's Arabs grow increasingly restless, desiring a unified state, free from imperialism and western degeneracy. This is nothing new, and these feelings have been unleashed before, in the July 14th revolution (which drew its inspiration from the uprisings in Egypt and elsewhere). However, the revolution's failure did not defeat Iraqi Pan-Arabism, but instead made it clandestine, efficient, and highly organized through the Ba'ath party. While one might not be able to see the Ba'aths they are there nonetheless. Their posters appear at night despite the government's and garrison's dual efforts to remove them; their slogans are shouted at ever more common protests; and the desert seems to have an inexhaustible supply of these dedicated, angry men, hungry for the power they're sure will inevitably come their way."
