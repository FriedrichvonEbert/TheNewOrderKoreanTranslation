 POLITICS_YUUMJAAGIIN_TSEDENBAL_DESC:0 "Yumjaagiin Tsendenbal was born in poverty in the waning days of the Bogd Khanate, but like the nascent Mongolian People's Republic, he hoped to rise above his humble origins. Studying in both Mongolia and the Soviet Union, Tsedenbal proved to be both a knowledgeable student and a devout socialist. He began climbing the ladder in 1939, when he achieved the office of Deputy Minister of Finance at the age of 23. However, the Japanese invasion and conquest of Mongolia dashed his political ambitions, and the government he was so eager to serve had ceased to exist.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Khorloogiin Choibalsan and the remnants of the government joined the Red Army in retreating to Tuva, Tsedenbal refused to abandon his beloved Mongolia so easily. He fled into the countryside, coordinating partisan cells, shipping supplies, and biding his time for a second Mongolian people's revolution. Thanks to his administrative acumen, he was able to transform what would have otherwise been a disorganized rabble of nomads and deserters into an effective shadow government, waiting for the day where they could return to Ulaanbaatar and resume running the country.\n\nAnd now, that day is upon them. In the chaos of the revolution, Chairman Tsedenbal commands his forces along the front the same way that the now-disgraced Choibalsan did at Khalkhin Gol. And he hopes to achieve a similar victory over the Japanese and their Chahar lapdogs, or he will die trying."
