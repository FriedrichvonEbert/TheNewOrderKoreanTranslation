 RAD_RUS.1.desc:0 "언제나 그랬듯이 시베리아의 춥고 추운 날이었습니다. 눈이 지면을 덮으며 그 아래의 태양을 본 적도 없고, 앞으로도 보지 못할 흙을 감추었습니다. 아르티움이 장화를 신고 모피를 입은 채 한 손에는 새 보따리를, 다른 손에는 소총을 들고 걸어가면서 위의 구름을 보았습니다. 구름이 평상시보다 더 어두우며 폭풍이 올 것처럼 보였습니다.\n\n털과 가죽에 쌓인 눈을 털고서는 그의 금방이라도 쓰러질 것 같은 오두막의 문을 열고 들어가 물건들을 근처의 탁장 위에 조심스럽게 올려놓았습니다.\n\nAfter a quiet moment of contemplation as he remarked over his quiet abode and lit his lamp, he scratched his dog, Sasha, behind the ear and turned on the radio as he did everyday, and frowned as he got nothing besides static.\n\nArtyom quickly started surfing through the few stations he reached, and found nothing but static, static, and more static. After some time, he shrugged, he had expected the old tilting radio tower near the equally dilapidated village to collapse for days now, nothing could be done. The outside world, and all of its wonders, were nothing but a distant thought for Artyom, and after a sigh, he turned off the radio for the last time."

 RAD_RUS.2.desc:0 "The old man sat, like he did many days, just outside of the cabin on the hill in which he had lived for decades.\n\nSlowly, he rocked in his chair, an old, beaten radio sitting next to a pile of books, blaring out hectic announcements about the destruction of Germania, of Tokyo, of London and Rome, and of New York City. Even from his perch on this hill, he could see distantly the change in the color of the sky, some sort of wayward weapon launched into the Russian wastes. The Germans, no doubt. It was always the Germans.\n\nThe man sighed, wiping a tear from his eye, looking at the old red flag which he still hung from the wall next to his door.\n\nIn a well practiced movement, with shaky hands he slowly removed a weathered photograph. He looked at the figures in it, all so much younger back then. They were at their teacher's funeral, all of them. Before it had all gone so wrong... before he had played his own hand in destroying the world...\n\nThe old man pushed the photo back into his coat and turned off the radio. After contemplating the distant sky and wiping away a final tear, he stood up and walked inside, before firmly closing the door behind him.\n\nThe past was in the past, but all had to pay for it."

 RAD_RUS.3.desc:0 "The bombs fell, and the bombs destroyed civilization as the world knew it. It some places, however, civilization had not truly existed, at least not for a long, long time.\n\nIn Western Russia, many died as the Germans, out of spite, dropped any spare nuclear weapons in their arsenal on Russia, perhaps out of a hope that the Russians would not be the ones to win the wastes.\n\nThis did not work, however, for the real damage made by a nuclear weapon is its effect on a society, and the Russians had already built a society well used to German bombs and atrocities. In the time after the bombs fell and the world went silent, the Russias continued as they had, fighting, pillaging, battling one another for land.\n\nIn West Russia, however, large bands of Russians, bandits and mercenaries, settlers and adventurers, all began the long trek west. In a horde they came, scaring off or destroying the struggling communities of Germans holding on in the wasteland, and slowly but surely, they drifted through Moskowien, through the remains of Poland, and into Germany itself."

 RAD_RUS.4.t:0 "The Second Sun" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.4.desc:0 "The SS would be forgotten, in time. Another remnant of an ancient civilization that would be left for the archaeologists of the future to theorize on. However, like many lost things of the last age, they would struggle for survival in this new world, furiously refusing to accept that what they once fought for was well and truly gone. Ashes and smoke, dust and dust.\n\nOne such splinter persisted in the land of Cossacks and grain for two decades after the collapse. The land they guarded was known as having once been a military base, though nobody could quite tell what was on it. The soldiers would shoot any who dared come near, whether the harried German survivors or the bandits of the east, and all the natives knew to avoid it.\n\nThe SS inside plotted, behind closed doors, to create a great second sun and purge clean the filth that inhabited what was once a great Empire. Nobody would ever know this, however, or the story of the one aged man, who in the uniform of evil stepped into the room where these men worked day and night to restore the great tools of war, armed with only a pistol and his faith.\n\nA second sun bloomed across the land that day, and nothing would show that the SS once persisted here besides the simmering remains of the missile base."

 RAD_RUS.5.t:0 "Faith and Fire" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.5.desc:0 "The small church survived the fires which wiped out Tyumen. Isolated as it was and bereft of anything valuable to steal, the building and its congregation survived the decades of hunger and cold that followed. The mayor had perished in the fires, and it was up to the local priest, an outcast of little note, to guide the villagers and refugees through the harsh times.\n\nIt was thirty years after the fires when the old Bishop died, his replacement elected from the priests he had appointed and the man himself given as luxurious a funeral as the village could provide. Sixty years after the fires ended, the first of the Great Warlords, claiming to be a reincarnation of Old Zhukov, strode through the small town square and proclaimed his dominion over what had become known simply as "Church Town" and its inhabitants for a thousand years hence. Soon his rival, the Chairwoman of a new Soviet Union based out of old Yugra, drove him over the mountains and back into Yakutia from whence he came, and she too proclaimed her rightful leadership over Church Town in front of the Bishop's mausoleum. A hundred and twenty four years after the ash fell, when the Fourth Chairman was slain by his own generals, the Archbishop took the opportunity to quietly stop paying taxes to his nominal liege.\n\nA hundred and eighty seven years after the world died, the Church Upon the Hill had become the center of a thriving if troubled trade city, constantly appeasing whichever of the Diadochi demanded tribute that year. A hundred and ninety three years after the smoke cleared, the Metropolitan of Tserkov' na Kholme proclaimed a holy Kingdom of his own atop the ashes of six armies sent to slay him and burn his city to the ground.\n\nThree hundred and two years after the bombs ended what was, a part of Rus was once again subsumed into a greater whole."

 RAD_RUS.6.t:0 "The Cossack" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.6.desc:0 "There had been a time, he was sure, when things were not quite so bleak. If he were to call back to his oldest memories, back when the Tsar had still reigned and Bukharin was but another member of the party, then he could even recall feeling joyous about the way in which the world was headed.\n\nUnder the Soviets things had been harsh of course, but all the same he had continued onwards in the sure knowledge that his nation would travel through the bitter age into one of light and joy. Then the Germans, carelessly, irreverently, callously destroyed everything he had valued in nought but a night. His family dead, his nation sundered - his spirit had broken. But as the old Cossack sat upon the hill, gazing upon the great mushroom clouds in the distance, something inside him awoke.\n\nWhen the villagers flocked to his house with question he answered and organized them into a militia to stop the inevitable bandit raids. When the disparate mix of former soldiers, some still wearing the robes of the vanished Red Army, passed through the village he recruited those of good temperament and spirit. When the long winter ended, an army set forth to bring peace to a motherland long wracked by war.\n\nThe task was not completed in his lifetime, nor that of his successor, or her successor after. But eventually, part of the motherland was peaceful and free from the tyrants who had for so long brought nothing but ruin to its people. For a time. And in the streets of what had once been Moscow, the vigilant traveler might find the lovingly preserved statue of the old Cossack."

 RAD_RUS.7.t:0 "And Just Because He's Human" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.7.desc:0 "What is a man?\n\nIs a man just a human being with intelligence? Is he a man because he can think and feel? No, for a slave can do that as easily as any man. His father had been a slave before the fires blotted out the horizon, beholden to the local officers and whatever bandit king was stronger than the rest on a given day. His death had only bound his family to the servitude he was shackled to in life.\n\nDoes a human become a man by belief, by some secret knowledge that in truth he is no bound to the will of another? His brother had believed that, right up until the moment the guards beat him half to death for talking back and finding he could do nothing. He hadn't lasted so long after that.\n\nMaybe what makes a man is birth? Some arcane and unknowable force that gives other men the power over others? But if that were true then the son of the old Baron would not be working here beside him, half starved and missing an eye. No, no liberation from above was evident, nor was any forthcoming.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that a man chooses. A slave obeys.\n\nAnd Vasily, youngest son of Ivan, worker in the mines, reflected that it might be time to stop obeying the overseer."

 RAD_RUS.8.t:0 "A man would like a little bite to eat" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.8.desc:0 "Hunger was an old friend to the people of the steppe. A gnawing, constant companion for those who lived on the edge of the known world. When crops failed, you felt hunger. When the sheep died, you felt hunger. When the lords and generals came for their taxes you felt hunger most keenly of all. For they took what was not theirs to take.\n\nIn times long past some of the elders claimed that things had not been this way - they spoke of times of plenty, where every man could eat his fill and nobody paid more tax than any other. But who amongst the lords and the army men would listen to the tales of some scum from the steppe? Even the wrath of Allah, raised against their decadent cities like blinding fire, had not been enough to crush them completely, for like rodents they emerged from the earth and rebuilt them.\n\nBut on this night, the young men of the clan were ready to prove to the army men and the lords that it was poor practice to take the food of a starving man and not make sure he was dead afterwards. Readying the old PPSH his grandfather so treasured, the boy watched silently as the column of men marched below the hillside below. It clung to his overalls, a chill presence.\n\nThen at the signal, he moved. Slowly the figures descended into the village - the peace of the night was lost amidst the screams and growing, rank smell of smoke."

 RAD_RUS.9.t:0 "He Wants No Bull and a Lot of Talk" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.9.desc:0 "The bunker was a dark and dreary place for civilization to have been displaced into, a concrete nightmare of dull edges and flat empty walls. The Commissar had been surprised the day he was told that if the worst happened, it would be himself and no other who would take charge of the survivors of Bunker A4. In retrospect he supposed it was no real promotion so much as it was sidelining him to allow the Major to promote his son to the position of regimental Commissar.\n\nBut the world was full of irony, and the Commissar was quite certain that neither the Major, his son or anyone else outside the bunkers was alive. The screams of those poor souls, rent in the inner parts by the aftereffects of nuclear annihilation, had ceased months ago anyway. He'd heard their cries drift into the dead static on the radios.\n\nNo, the trouble that the Commissar was running into was keeping high the spirits of those who were trapped in Bunker A4 with him. Those either selected for their skills or lucky enough to have been near the entrance when the sirens sounded were alive, which put them at a great advantage to their contemporaries, but they were growing restive. He kept up the patriotic speeches as much as he could. He reminded them that their survival was ensured with the rudimentary designs of the complex (at least until the food ran out or the water systems spoiled), and that to continue living both spited the hated enemy and honored the memory of the fallen.\n\nBut if he was honest, he was unsure how much good his speeches did. And if Bunker A4 had its own Commissar doubting the future, what could be said of its soldiers?"

 RAD_RUS.10.t:0 "That Gives No Bread or Meat" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.10.desc:0 "The crops had been poor one year too many. A single year of failed crops and people would curse, but they might go on with their lives afterwards and keep it as a bitter memory. Two years of failed crops was a disaster, but one that could be managed with stored foods and appropriate reductions in the taxes paid. Three years though, three years was dangerous. It implied something supernatural was punishing the village for its sins. Or, as some were whispering in the darker alleys and the tavern, the sins of its leaders.\n\nLocal Party Chairman Mikhail had tried to quell those rumors at first by donating out of his own stock three fine pigs for a village feast, but the villagers had been more interested in the fact that he could so easily give out three of the fattest pigs they had ever seen when the livestock on their own lands was so thin a breeze might blow it over. Boris had never considered himself the most socially observant of men but even he could see that the cauldron of poor decisions might easily boil over if the wrong actions were taken.\n\nWhich was why he now sat in the middle of the street, accordion in hand, singing a song his grandmother had taught him from her youth. The accordion sat uncomfortable in his hands, and he got sore easily, but old habits built from childhood were hard to erode. Quickly the Commissar's tune became steady and his song acquired a rustic strength to it.\n\nAt first the village folk were unsure of what was going on, and then the eldest amongst them began taking up the verse. Then the children, eager to please, added their fickle voices to the harmony. It took time, but eventually all in the village, from Old Mikhail to the drunken beggars, had joined the chorus.\n\nThe talks still took a few days afterwards, but the fire had cooled, and the village folk accepted that another year would be given a chance before action was decided. Everything had calmed, for now."

 RAD_RUS.11.t:0 "Erasing What Was" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.11.desc:0 "It had always been a quiet town, before the bombs. One of relative peace and quiet, situated comfortably in the eastern woods. Yet when the bombs fell, bringing great roaring flame to the cities of men, the peace was broken.\n\nIt was not the bombs that brought chaos to this quiet place, but those within. As the degradation of outside society occurred, the townsfolk felt the effects despite their separation. The cessation of all essential imports, the sudden lack of governance, the collapse of local security forces. Whilst not struck by the bombs, the town was still struck by utter disaster. And that was when the fanaticism erupted.\n\n"Remove all traces! Simple lives for simple men!" the leaders cried. "Let us never return to those corrupted ways!", they would proclaim, in reference to the technology upon which they all had once relied. A wave of anti-technological fervor swept the town. Vehicles were burned where they stood. Books educating upon any topics of technological significance were destroyed. Any piece of post-industrial technological progress was brought to ruin. Even firearms, initially used to enforce compliance with the destructive mob, had their ammunition expended and were in turn destroyed.\n\nYet what initially began as a flare of violent fervor, created the benefit of early adaptation to the new world. Unlike many societies, who would cling to the final operational facets of the industrialized world until it would spell their doom, the village found itself reverting to a rather primitive society within a very short period of time, forced by themselves to adapt quickly to the changing world.\n\nAs the years would drag on, and as the town survived many hardships, the reactionary fervor of days past was all but forgotten. The town would continue to stand the test of time, as progress was made to a brighter future once again. Only the lingering name of the village - Simple Town - was left to bear witness to the chaos which had once rocked it."

 RAD_RUS.12.desc:0 "In the boundless steppes that form the heart of of the great continent, far from the great rivers and mountains, roams a growing nomadic society. The boundless grassy flats of the steppes have long been home to a plethora of different peoples. With the lands so well suited to grazing, pack animals and livestock herds became incredibly abundant. With so few conditions existing to attach the natives to their land, entire societies took to the saddle. Entire populations began to roam the steppes, with few permanent settlements dotted throughout the lands.\n\nThe phenomenon of mobile societies grew to be an increasingly common sight in the great steppe. Some roamed peacefully about the lands, tending to their livestock and moving when favorable, yet others took their mobility to a more aggressive advantage. Talk of roving societies of raiders upon horseback were spoken of in hushed voices. Great bands of mounted warriors traveled between settlements with an ultimatum; to present to them a tribute, or to face the sacking and plunder of their homes - eventually the riders grew drunk on their power and brought torment to all in their reach who remained rooted to their lands.\n\nThe evolution of a mobile society created many woes for the people of the steppes, and those surrounding it. Scarcely could one consider themselves distant from risk. Yet it also created great opportunity for those willing to seize it, by saddle and sword."

Cold, dark, and isolated, one would think the people of this far north land would be melancholy and quiet, concerned only with maintaining their meagre state of survival. Yet, this was never so in these days, in part because of the efforts of the Cirque. No one knew exactly where or when the Cirque was first founded, or what its motivations had ever been. No one knew exactly what a Cirque was, even--but that didn't stop them from enjoying it.\n\nThe Cirque traveled from town to town, settlement to settlement, commune to commune, spreading stories and mirth as they went. Popular with the young and the old alike, their stories sang of ancient ages, long past; ages where man conquered the sky and stars, where the land around them was united under one red banner, then blue, then black, then red again. Their stories inspired a vision for a future in the young and a nostalgia for the past in the old, exciting and invigorating them all.\n\nEach of the plays and dances of the Cirque were a source of hope and comfort to the people of this frigid country. Their songs told not only of the past, but of a vision of the future, one that urged the men, women, and children of the north onwards, to a brighter life ahead of them."

 RAD_RUS.14.desc:0 "No one could remember when Lenin died, and just as many could remember why exactly they guarded his corpse so zealously. For generations, the villagers surrounding the hovel that was once the city of Tyumen worked tirelessly to keep the casket that contained his corpse safe. Once, surely, they had known their purpose. They had known why this man was so important that generations should gladly give their lives to protect him.\n\nBut that was a long time ago, and now they worked day and night to protect little more than a skeleton. They did what they could to keep the body preserved, but the techniques and technology their ancestors had used so long ago had faded from memory. And so the venerated man in the casket had withered and faded until he was little more than bone, hair, and a suit. Even the man's name had faded from memory. The word Lenin remained, yes, but if this was his first or last name, none of them could say. The time had come to lay this man to rest, at long last.\n\nAnd so it was that a grave was dug and the body was lowered gently into the grave. As the people of what was once Tyumen buried the body, they felt a sense of closure. They were ending a chapter in their history. Perhaps a new one would soon begin."

In the olden days did they ravish our lands, burn our fields, and steal our women and children to appease their dark god Nazeh.\n\nBut even in the darkest of times, hope was not lost. Brave men and women stood against the Gormayans -- oh, your many-times-grandfather was one of them, child! He survived even after the Gormayans destroyed his village, even after they left him in their den without clothes to protect against the winter snow, so great was his determination to defeat their evil.\n\nHe escaped from the Gormayans, you see, and found his way to the ruins of his home. From there he built an army to oppose them. They adorned themselves in armor of darkest black, shade of the ash into which the Gormayans had turned their lands. For years they waited, trained, prepared for the moment to deliver their vengeance... and one day, it came. In their own hubris, the Gormayans had weakened and bickered among themselves. The time had come to strike.\n\nAs one, your ancestor and his Black Army surged to meet the Gormayans in battle. Their struggle reduced cities to rubble and nations to ash. But in the end, the Gormayans lay defeated. Your ancestor paid a terrible price for his vengeance, young one, and you must never forget that. The monsters lay dead, but so did the world itself.\n\nAnd so he laid down his arms and worked to rebuild the world, to repay it for his role in destroying it. Our family has always, and will always, carry on his legacy, child, for we have the greatest of sins weighing on our backs."

 RAD_RUS.16.desc:0 "The assembly of the AKM rifle with serial number MX 5807 concluded at the Zlatoust Machine-Building Plant at precisely midnight, where it would be loaded into a box along with several others and assorted ammo and shipped off to its buyer by truck.\n\nHalfway through its journey, the world ended. It would never reach its buyer, as their city had been scorched to magma by a nuclear blast. The driver would turn around and try to find somewhere to take refuge, abandoning the truck when it ran out of fuel. Several weeks would pass before the truck and its contents were discovered by wandering refugees. MX 5807 was taken by a young woman who would go on to use it to lethal effect in defending her loved ones from bandit raids and savage beasts, before her unfortunate demise at the hands of a violent drunk, who would proceed to turn the gun on himself in shame at his actions.\n\nThe gun would lie beside their slowly rotting bodies for days, accruing rust and mildew in the meantime, before being picked up by a wanderer heading for the mountains. In time he would sell it for a bottle of vodka, and the gun's journey would continue. From hand to hand it would pass, but as the years wore on and ammunition grew scarce it became less of a weapon and more of a trophy piece. For twenty years it would hang within the tent of a great warlord as he marched west, before being won in an arm wrestling contest by one of his underlings.\n\nFollowing his master's final defeat, the underling found himself lost and penniless in a foreign land. On Baltic shores he would try to pawn it off as a great relic of old times. Alas, by now MX 5807 was but rusted junk, and merchants would scoff and turn him away. He would die nameless at the edge of what had been the Commonwealth, a kindly stranger taking the time to bury him with his remaining possessions, including his ancient treasure.\n\nWhen MX 5807 saw the sun again, curious faces stared down at it, dusting it off carefully with special tools. It would be cataloged, shipped away and eventually displayed on a shelf in a great hall of ancient knowledge. Countless souls would look upon it, pondering what the pile of ancient shards and rusted fragments could ever have been used for."

 RAD_RUS.17.desc:0 ""For the inhabitants of Uralia, things certainly could have been worse. From what could be pieced together so long after the event, the cleansing flames had not affected the region much at all. At least, if one where to ask a traveler from the east or west, they would paint a picture of devastation that was simply not to be found in the snowy mountains where many had in fact fled to during the Great Exodus. While it is harsh and unforgiving, ask any Uralian if they would rather live somewhere else, and they would look at you with their red-rimmed eyes as if you were crazy.\n\nI had a chance to speak to several Uralians candidly about their history and legends while I was researching for this book, and found that there are many stories to be found in the shadow of those mountains. One legend of note concerned a rumored legion of ghost warriors who have appeared over the long years to cause chaos and violence. There may seem to be something to these rumors, for I have found documentations of entire villages going missing in recent years. However, my book examines the evidence and I believe that the nomadic tendency of the people of the Urals is the cause of these disappearances rather than anything supernatural. As for the source of the legend, I have also discovered interesting information regarding a pre-Catastrophe bandit gang that is the likely inspiration for these myths.\n\nAnother prominent regional superstition I investigated was that of the so-called "Shadow Mountain" where none but the bravest or most stubborn Uralian would dare approach sober. While questioning East Eurasians can often be a difficult task for a foreigner, I was met with even stiffer resistance than usual. Apparently it is an uncomfortable subject, though I confess that my lack of progress in this area makes speculation as to why this is the case difficult. Obviously the claims that a great demon resides under the mountain itself is nothing more than myth, but I remain disappointed in my inability to discover the context and explanation behind said myth..."\n\nExcerpt from "On the Legends and Superstitions of the East-Eurasian Peoples" by Kynrid Atum""

Tears streamed down, washing away the dirt that marred his hands, flowing past the gaps in his fingers; the first time in such long years.\n\n"What are you doing here, mister?" said a voice, childish and distant. "Are you lost?" He looked up, his eyes red. He stared at the child, a boy of nine, for some time, his lips unmoving. No nerve in his body could command them to open. Finally, his throat screeched a pathetic reply, "What?" He drew up the sleeves of his uniform. "Do you see this?" He pointed to his tattoos, tracing the swastikas as they snake their way through his arm. "I'm your enemy! You should fear me!" He strode forward only for his knees to fail him, and he landed face-first on the ground.\n\nThe child laughed. Valdemar groaned on the ground.

The black gold so valued in the old world was hard to come by, so far from the ruins of the Mountain Reich and its vast, arcane facilities. With no source of the strange, flammable liquid to hand, those elders who knew its secrets felt no need to pass their knowledge down to later generations. So it was that the horse, once obsolete to all save the impoverished nomads of the World-That-Was, became a dominant force on the battlefield once more.\n\nOf all the disparate tribes who remained in the harsh steppes north of the Three Seas, none were so fearsome as the Eagle Guard. Riders without compare, the Guard were born of the merging of two older and equally mighty tribes: the White Eagles, exiles from a verdant land far to the west, and the Gorno-gvardia, hard and cold-eyed men of the northern mountains who had come south seeking allies against the wicked Cult of the Hooked Cross. Once thought destroyed in the fires that consumed their original homeland, the Cult had constructed a new temple-city in the frozen north from which a new and horrific empire of slavery and genocide was spreading.\n\nAt the head of a grand coalition of southern tribes, the newly-formed Eagle Guard struck north, leading charge after charge into the howling blizzards. Even as their allies buckled and retreated before the frigid northern winds, the Guard was relentless in their advance. The battle was not yet lost so long as a single Guard and his horse kept fighting - and they numbered in the thousands. With gun, sword and lance, the Eagle Guard thundered through the Cult's lines like an unstoppable force of nature, the name of Saint Mendowicz on their lips. By the time the blizzards began to subside and green returned to the tundra, the Temple of the Hooked Cross was a smoking ruin, and the banner of the Straight and True Cross flew over the palace of the Aryan Priest-King.\n\nThis is the most famous of their tales, but far from the last. Even today, the Eagle Guard spreads its wings across the steppes, banishing evil and Aryan devilry wherever it might be found."

All across the scattered steppe and cold expanses of tundra, men and women woke up, got dressed, and carried on with their day. Many nations continued in some sense, for better or for worse. The Tale of the Black Mountain of the latter.\n\nIn the center of the old land was the Black Mountain. Before the war, the surrounding region was ruled by a maniac, whose perverted experiments lingered in the public memory long after his name was forgotten. The Thinker, as he came to be known, was obsessed with the concept of human purity and the refinement thereof. He believed that athleticism, intelligence, even morality could be made a function of chemical formulas and trauma, observed and tested for through vile experimentation on live humans. The Thinker knew no ethical restraint, exposing his unwilling subjects to boiling heat and freezing cold, unproven pharmaceuticals, or physical torture; nothing was too depraved.\n\nWhen the bombs fell, the Thinker himself survived in his mountain. In the years following the Last War, he used the fruits of the apocalypse to conjure up newer, more horrific experiments. In time, the Black Mountain ruled over the land in much the same way as before the War.\n\nBut for all his depravity, the Thinker never produced anything in the Mountain other than misery. His crimes against humanity went unpunished, as he died in his sleep. Perhaps that is the lot of man.

Major cities in the region were disappearing, and people told tales of utter destruction and chaos wherever these massive explosions were happening. The priest thought he had an idea of what was going on, though.\n\nAndrei grabbed the Bible and quickly looked through its pages. As he did so, he recited verses he could remember, that all had something in common, something they revolved around: the Second Coming. The Day of Judgment by God Himself had come, and those who served him would join him in heaven, while those who did not would burn in hell. Holding the Bible in his hands, he ran to the grand entrance of the building and looked at the town for one last time. Seconds later, he was blinded by the lights.

But when the Great Fire came, that did not matter.\n\nIn a corner of this free nation, four warlords fought endlessly. ere won and lost and won and lost again, and alliances shifted so often, so much that they mattered little. What was all that for? Each believed in something different, unique ways to govern their lands, and unique ways to achieve peace and prosperity. Their thoughts mattered little when the Great Fire torched them all to the ground. They struggled for survival, yet they never deigned to seek help from their enemies. And when the fathers that had led these states for years relayed their knowledge and wishes to their children, their key instructions were simple: do not let others take your town.\n\nTheir children did not let them win, and neither did their grandchildren. For generations after the Great Fire, the wars continued. However, slowly, the lines dividing their beliefs began to fade away. The original ideas from before the Fire were twisted and changed, and the mysterious names to describe them were forgotten with the passage of time. In the end, the four states came to a realization. What were they fighting for? No one could remember, and it seemed that all that they believed in was the destruction of their enemies and nothing else. But their ancestors, who cemented these ideas, were long gone. So did these states come together. Their new leaders came into an agreement, and from then, a new nation was formed. Its goal was to rebuild the ruins of the Great Fire, to survive and prosper, and help those who couldn't. The old "ideologies" were gone, as they were replaced by the mere wish to survive in a dying world."

Just before the fires came, it was said, the last monarch of those simpler times spoke to all the people of the isles through powers long forgotten. For centuries, the people of Britain had protected their monarch through an incantation of power repeated ad infinitum, calling upon God to save them from their enemies and to bring them victory. But in their last act before the end, the monarch had turned this power back upon the people, invoking the words "God bless you all."\n\nIn doing so, the monarch had called upon centuries of druidic power to protect Britain, relenting their own protection and perishing in the process - and it was this final act of love that saved the isles from total extinction. As the Britons began to rise once more into a renewed world, this myth of ultimate sacrifice for one's country would form the basis of a new national epic, an ethos that endured in the hearts of men. It warmed them in the dark times and guided them in the bright ones.\n\nThe legend's variants were indecisive on who this monarch really was.

And so the mob would burn their leader, as they had burned many others. When that did not bring them the promised rapture they would turn on each other, until the few that remained after the bloodshed would return to their homes, resigned to the knowledge that the new world, for better or worse, was here to stay."

 RAD_EU.17.desc:0 "Once upon a time, in the realm of the northern Celts, there lived a great King. As a King he was noble, wise and fair, and his courtiers and subjects loved him for his benevolent character. In time he would take a Queen, one who he would love like no other in the world.\n\nOne day, the Queen fell very ill. The King's physician discovered that she had caught the Tumors, and that she was unlikely to last more than a few years more. Distraught, the King turned to his scholars in the desperate hope of finding a cure. Yet none could be found. And so the King instead turned to the people who loved him so, and promised to whoever could discover a cure for her affliction would be rewarded with whatever was in his power to grant.\n\nA gallant Knight heard of his plea, and embarked upon a quest to find the cure. After searching high and low, first throughout the Kingdom, then the isles themselves, he finally found the answer. An old wise woman told him of an ancient cure held by the old ones, used to eliminate or, at the very least, stem the tide of the Tumors. The secrets of its production had been lost, but stashes of them could still be found if one knew where to look. This great panacea had a name - the Chemo.\n\nAfter further research, the Knight finally discovered a source for the Chemo. He rode far south to the halls of St Bartholomew in the lands of Kent, only to find that its ancient walls had been occupied by the forces of the Hun-Beyond-the-Sea, in some mad effort to retake the isles through an ancient claim. In the name of his King, and in the name of the isles, the brave Knight told the plight of his Queen to all who would hear, and before long he had gathered a small host of warriors to claim the halls.\n\nAfter a long and hard battle, the Knight was victorious, and the invaders were driven back into the sea. Claiming his prize, he returned to Scotland and presented his panacea to the King. The Chemo was administered to the Queen, and though she lost her long flowing hair in the process, she was granted many more years with her beloved. The King offered the Knight anything he desired in return for his brave quest.\n\nIn the end, all the Knight requested for his troubles was to have the honor of serving at his King's side; he would continue to serve him and the people of his Kingdom for all his days."

Her own fate, she could accept, but for little Simon and his big sister Lisa - herself holding Beatrice's other hand - the thought was too terrible to bear. She had visions of them both burning in the flames of Inferno come to Earth, and her mind immediately rushed to where they too might find shelter.\n\nBut she knew that they were right in the heart of the capital, and in spite of the efforts of the panicking crowds around them there would be very little to be achieved by hiding. Images filled her mind of what might happen if they did live. Of Simon succumbing over many weeks to the ravages of radiation. Of Lisa wasting away in a world where all the food had turned to ash. Of them both having to watch as she was dragged away by maddened survivors in search of a slave. Or food. Or worse.\n\nThe world might turn right again, one day. But she knew none of them would live or remain sane long enough to see it. So she did the only thing she could do. She sat down on the steps of the old theater and held her children tight, like she did every night before bed. Through her tears, she told them of how much they made her proud, of how much she loved them every day, and how she knew that they would stay together, wherever they were going.\n\n"Where are we going, mummy?" asked Lisa through shuddering sobs.

Growing up, he had heard the nightmarish tales told by her parents of how their people had once been hunted, reviled, treated as less than dirt by the great blonde beasts who had ruled this land long ago. The boy was himself possessed of a mop of golden blonde hair and shy blue eyes, and he often feared the girl saw in him the monsters that had once haunted her nightmares.\n\nAnd yet on that day, when his beloved suddenly turned to him, embraced him and sealed her love with a kiss, his fears were at last put to rest.

After weeks of debate, they approached it--cautiously at first, but when the first man touched it and survived, their own experimentation began. The carvings on the fallen star, for that was what they decided it had to have been, seemed almost like the letters the oldest members of their tribe knew as the letters of the world before. "N A S A", the carvings read.\n\nOn their second day of exploration, one inquisitive child noticed something new. The top of the thing, which had been covered in rubble, seemed almost transparent. When they pressed their faces to it, they could almost see the form of a man inside. This discovery urged the Flurens on: this fallen star contained another human! They labored for three days and three nights, beating the windows of the fallen spacecraft with rocks, stones, and even a few rusted tools.\n\nOne day, the black barrier gave way, and as the first tribesmen stuck his head in and breathed the dusty air, what he saw amazed and terrified him. The shape they had seen was a man, yes, but a man unlike any ever seen before. He was covered in white cloth, and on his head rested a massive dome, constructed of similar material as the barrier they had broken through before. A skull smiled at them from the other side of the helm.\n\nIt was sorrowful, the tribe reflected. They had thought the man inside the star would be a god, a hero, a sorcerer. But no, he was merely a corpse, for gods, heroes, and sorcerers don't die.\n\nThe craft itself was of far more interest, they realized. The buttons, knobs, and metals that constructed it were wonders, and while they knew not what the craft was for or how to construct another, they took comfort in the fact that mankind had once dwelled amongst the stars.\n\nThe Flurens named themselves in honor of the craft's apparent creator, for they would one day reach the sky above, as the man in the star had.

No one remembered a peaceful time in the history of the island, despite the skeletons of cities and towns that promised that it had happened in the past.\n\nBut the people of the island clung to one hope: the stone. The stone sat in the center of the largest town-state of the isles, and it was whispered among the peasants of the land that whoever could open the safe and retrieve the object within was destined to unite the island, and to become the first and final King that had evaded them for so many miserable years.\n\nMany had tried, and many had failed. The simplest solution was to simply break the stone open, but no matter how hard they tried, the metal wouldn't crack. There was one small hope, however.

Their kings were, for the most part, wise and fair: until their newest king had executed a child for the crime of crying in his presence.\n\nThe people hadn't quite considered the possibility of a cruel, unjust king before. After all, you had to be wise and fair to be a king--that was why they had kings in the first place, surely. At first, they searched for the last king's true son, for surely this brute couldn't have been descended from the wise old man they had all adored as children. But their efforts were fruitless. The tyrant that sat in their village was, by all their customs and laws, the rightful king.\n\nHis claim was true, then, but the people of the village were never content to sit by when a problem presented itself. They armed themselves with the stone axes and picks they had before used to build their homes. Some stole the rusted iron tools the king hoarded for himself, deep in the rusted mine the village had been built around so many years ago.\n\nAs one, the people stormed the King's home, and, carrying him on their shoulders, threw him into the mine. Then they used the tools they had brought to chip away at the very foundations of the ancient mine, and collapsed it in on their tyrant king.\n\nThe people celebrated for three days and three nights, for never again would they bow to a tyrant such as the king they had buried. As they danced and sang, a strange idea formed. No one was quite sure who first whispered it into another's ear, but soon they had all heard of the bold new proposal for their lives.\n\nThey, the people, would come together as a village, and discuss their problems. They would cast their own votes, and whichever ideas had the most votes would be implemented. Never again would a King rule them. The idea quickly took hold upon the youth, and even the elderly found it had a certain romantic charm to it.\n\nThe first vote was on the topic of names. Their prized tradition of having no names was an invention of the kings, some argued, and they should give themselves names as the oldest of their ancestors once did. The vote was passed by a margin of one old man, and the people spent the next month naming one another, and their homes, and their village, and the tyrant they had deposed.\n\nIn the end, though the new form of life had its troubles, the people had started something amongst themselves, a fire burning in their very souls.

Estimates for the date of this disaster range from anywhere between one to three and a half millennia prior to the modern day. There is much evidence prevalent in the historical record that lends credence to the existence of such an event, such as the near complete void of cultural data that has been uncovered past the Shadow Ages, but also recent revelations of advanced technological innovations apparently developed prior to this event - for instance the so called "Nigma Device" that excited archaeologists last year, as well as the many hulking wrecks of ancient steel warships found by divers over the last few decades.\n\nWhile the nature of what we shall term the Post-Antediluvian Collapse (henceforth P.A.C) has been lost to time, a multitude of theories have been posited by those seeking to better understand this difficult era of human history. Creek and Jianqi, et al. posit a notion in their paper "The Population Bottleneck" that, as evidenced by the Hulme quotient of the skeletal structure of bodies recovered from before the P.A.C, humankind experienced a drastic decline in fertility that resulted in a collapsed population and a complete breakdown in societal order. Though the validity of Hulme's theories in bioprediction are disputed, this theory is currently the most widely accepted of explanations for the collapse.\n\nThe issue is far from settled, however. In Konyevske's paper "Radiography in Anthrogeological Studies," she suggests instead that the heightened radioactive state of P.A.C artifacts that have been recovered to date may hold a clue as to the fate of the ancient world; that some radiological event of massive scale must certainly have occurred to cause such an anomaly. Other (though less accepted) theories include a worldwide outbreak of Phage, a collapse of oxygen levels, a significant alteration in solar activity and a major cosmological impact event. More controversial scholars suggest that the Antediluvian world is actually a myth, such as the First World school of historical thought that states..."\n\n- Excerpt from "Ponderings on the Historical Void", Authored by Dr. Gunthir Parlya of the University of New Atiles, Department of Anthrogeology."

Past mountains and hills, through fields and forests, into settlements both great and small, the banks of the Danube weave deep into the heartlands of Europe, and its waters touch the nooks and crannies of the great Heartland of its core.\n\nThey say that in the days of old, civilizations both great and small rose and fell upon the banks of this river. Millions of people relied upon this great waterway. Just as the sun sustains life, so too did the revered Danube.\n\nYet, as the great empires of old faded from memory, the river continued to serve her purpose. As the great stone settlements of days gone crumbled and faded, new ones arose. New peoples settled upon the banks of the Danube, and as time marched onward, their numbers increased. Adventurous men took to the river as curious settlements ventured to contact others, building fragile networks of trade and friendship. In time, river-borne contact between settlements evolved into contact between nations. Different nations would begin to establish a full-blown market of goods on both sides of the waterway, and the winding river started to brim with vessels packed across its breadth.\n\nThe nations of the river rely on this trade. Scarcely can one travel these lands and not be reliant upon goods from other river-faring empires. Truly, the Danube has become the lifeblood of millions once again."

Their search for a mountain passage goes well. They proceed through the range with increasing haste as the rocky slopes and jagged peaks open up into more forgiving terrain. Believing their tiresome journey to be near a successful conclusion, the men become much more jovial.\n\nThen they stumbled across the frozen man.\n\nFrom the thawing winter ice the skeletal remains of a man emerge, half exposed from an icy shelf. Still fully clothed, the man wears peculiar winter garments that are all but alien to the men of the expedition. The arms of the garments bear several strange insignia, which cannot be comprehended by the men. Upon the skull rests a masterfully crafted steel helm. The most peculiar oddity of all, however, is the item that rested partially stuck within the ice.\n\nThe men, in their curiosity, chip away at the ice as to free the rest of the skeletal remains, exposing the legs of the figure as well as the odd item that rested by his side. A length of wood and metal, the men cannot discern the purpose which it might have possibly served. It appears to have no use as a tool in any practicality - no blade or heft to stab and pound, and the mechanisms of the object serve no real purpose other than to make noise.\n\nFollowing a short debate, the men of the expedition elect to carry the remains of the frozen man back to where they came for further study, as well as the odd object the corpse carried with it to its death."

The waves of the sea clash furiously with the great fortification, yet the wall stands firm, as it has for centuries.\n\nDespite the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the structure, it is clear to all that this wonder is not of natural formation.

All over, different people speculate a wide range of possibilities.\n\nSome say the wall was built by the gods, made to hold the terrors of the sea at bay. Most agree that the wall must have been erected by a great ancient civilization, now lost to time. But why would they construct it? Depending on who one asks, some may say that the wall was built to hold the sea in place, preventing a catastrophic flood. Others claim it was erected to bridge the gap between land masses and allow passage overland. Some unlikely theories even suggest that it was intended to drain a sea, or to harness the power of the waves, however that might have worked.\n\nDespite the speculations as to the origins of the wall, it stands firmly against the battering of the waves to this day.

Historians and scholars have since leapt upon the rising studies of this civilization, studying dug-up fortifications, ancient currency, and even some long lost structures, all marked with similar identifiers.\n\nClearly there are thousands of years of history that still lie beyond the present boundaries of our knowledge.

"What are you doing?" exclaims his subordinate. "Leaving." replies Theodor, as he begins to slowly reverse the truck out through the garage doors.

Many hoped this complex would contain a treasure trove of history to be discovered.\n\nYet what was discovered within was much more than many had bargained for.\n\nThrough thorough, multi-year studies, the shocking intent of these ancients has been unearthed. It appears as though the complex was designed as a protective bunker, made to shield the inhabitants from hazards upon ground level. This particular bunker, however, seems to have failed in its purpose, partially collapsing and dooming its inhabitants to permanent entrapment within, until their untimely deaths.\n\nThe true disturbing nature of this site comes not from the untimely fate of those within, but from the organization that controlled it. An organization with a decisive multi-staged organizational structure, they appeared to be one built upon death. Ideals of murder, enslavement, subjugation, and destruction were seemingly held dear by this group. It is unsure if this organization held such ideals due to a religious following that may have existed at the time, or otherwise. It is apparent that they did not exist alone, as signs exist that this group had, at one point before their demise, lines of communication with other external facets of their organization.\n\nA shocking discovery to most, this project has as of yet cast a very grim shadow upon the history of the ancient world."

In a grandiose finale, the new ruler was to be presented with a great dynastic heirloom - one that had passed through the heads of the family for countless generations. It was a peculiar kind of ancient weapon, wielded by the founder of the dynasty in ages past.\n\nThey say this predecessor was an inspirational warrior, wielding not only great skill upon the field of battle, but also an impeccable ability for leadership. Whilst little is recorded of his life story, it is said that prior to a catastrophic event that shattered the empires of his time, he was but a common citizen of a great nation, the likes of which are unimaginable today. Tales are told of his exploits following the great collapse, when he led an alliance of elite warriors under his leadership who provided protection to those under their influence. Unrivaled in combat, his warband grew with each victory, as did his legend.\n\nHis leadership and bravery paved the way for a kingdom that would stand for generations. Now, all that remained of his many treasures was the heirloom: a weapon that, whilst beyond the understanding of modern man, could strike down a foe from great distances by simply looking upon them and activating the mechanism within it. It was a wondrous and slightly unsettling concept that few believed could possibly be within the realm of possibility.\n\nThe young king was ceremoniously presented with the weapon, as the coronation drew to a close.

At the helm of the company was a man clad differently from the rest.\n\nThe curious villagers crowd around the strange arrivals, as the man at the front of the company began to speak.

He continued to speak of the great progress that came with being a citizen of the empire, and of the privileges of being under its rule. Before the villagers have but a moment to ponder the strange speech given to them by a man who could not so much as directly communicate with them, the man then followed with a bold announcement. All members of the village were now under the jurisdiction of this aforementioned empire, and owe to the empire a tithe.\n\nConfused, afraid, and unwilling to defy the metal-clad men, the villagers obliged, fetching whatever belongings necessary to satisfy the demands of the foreigners.

One of the arms was missing, but the broken remnants of the shoulder seemed like it lined up with the other arm, proudly posing hands-on-hips.

Only two kinds of people chose to cross; the desperate and the mad.\n\nThere was also a third sort. They came to the desert, looked at the wastes and the salt-flats, and stayed.\n\nEven before the Deluge, the desert had been home to the unwanted of the world's powers. The first of its inhabitants had not come out of choice, but over many years people had come willingly to escape whatever persecution, legitimate or no, that they may face. Some of them were innocents running from some unjust authority, others were crooks and knaves looking for a place to hide. Regardless of their reasoning, all struggled together to survive in the arid wasteland. Small townships and semi-nomadic bands would form, and over time the Adriani would come to tame the wastes. And where food could not be found by fishing in the Strait or farming what few crops would grow, the greenlands' bounty would suffice.\n\nBandits grew into raiders. Raiders grew into a horde.

Over the years, men have learned to avoid the lake at all costs, lest they too fall victim to the noxious death that lurks over the moor.\n\nThere are varying accounts that speak of why the curse of Widgemeer might exist. Some say that one god or another sought to protect the creatures of the lake from the greedy humans, and so made a place where they could live but man could not. Others say that on the eve of the Götterdämmerung, a great warrior bird fell from the sky into the lake, and that the corruption spreading from the rot of its still decaying flesh and its unborn eggs is toxic to man.\n\nRegardless of the reasons, men keep away, and for the wetland creatures that make the bog their home, Widgemeer is an unspoilt paradise, free from the corruption of the world beyond - until the curse lifts, that is."

The older generations would blather on monotonously about what once stood here, as was their right, but that time had come and gone. The slate was wiped clean and it would be impossible to rebuild what once stood before even if Man really wanted to. All that was really on Shaun's and Mark's minds was what they could scavenge, not the worn-out nostalgia of old men.\n\nWhilst looking over the remnants of the buildings that once stood tall over the city's inhabitants, Shawn noticed a rather peculiar sign...\n "Oi, Mark come over here."\n "The fuck yer wantin'?" replied Mark with snarky intent.\n "Here this sign, what the fuckin hell's a Hacienda?" retorted Shaun\n "Fuck knows." said Mark... "Let's delve in though, could be something useful."\n\nWhat they found there though astonished their minds, for it was like nothing they had ever seen before. The place had remarkably survived the very worst of the bombs and was thus able to convey the richness of its contents. Shawn and Mark found a huge hall, enough to fit a thousand people. They found a series of bars, all choked to the brim with the remains of a multitude of spirits. Some of them were only known to the two in the wistful whispers of old drunks. Finally, they found a series of rooms which held a large array of items Mark and Shawn had constantly heard the old fogies mutter on about relentlessly. They couldn't have missed them if they tried; the objects were described perfectly to the two lads who were transfixed by their sheer number.\n\nRecords, hundreds and hundreds of records."

The field proved mystical in its workings though. The men looked long and hard for the treasure said to be buried here, but found very little in terms of material items. Instead, they had only each other, united in the fear of the boss' retribution should they fail in their task.\n\n"God is punishing us." John stated to Malcolm as they dug through the ground using only their hands.\n\n"What for?" Malcolm asked.\n "Everything" said John wearily.\n\nDays, hours, months or weeks past.

In his town in La Mancha, the windmills were not merely historic landmarks, but essential to provide his neighbors with their daily bread.\n\nWhile he was up in the rafters replacing the broken part, he gazed out of a little window towards his town. The sun was rising in the east. Much of the old town still slept peacefully, awaiting the rooster's crowing. Suddenly the sun grew painfully bright, and Julio shielded his eyes in confusion. This couldn't be the sun, he thought. It was far too bright. A deafening thunder roared across the landscape, and a gigantic plume of dust began to rise in the distance. Before Julio could even cry out, he saw a shockwave tear apart the land and rip the town apart. Houses shattered to pieces with families still sleeping inside them. A historic church, having stood the test of time since the Reconquista, crumbled to dust before his eyes.\n\nJulio's windmill stood just outside the blast radius.

A promise, they said, handed from father to son and mother to daughter, from when the sun shone bright on these snowy climes. Words handed by their great forefathers, who the old crones told had fled that land for reasons nebulous. They shaped their desires into a sacred oath; time had shaped it into tradition.\n\nFor those addressed with it, however, no promise rings more hollow. The Ocean was vast, with no land in sight. Fishermen dared not to travel beyond eyesight of coast, for nothing awaited them beyond but Cap'n Jones and his watery lockbox. Most received the promise in one ear and let it leave out the other, before partaking in the customary po-teen dinner.\n\nOne man, his name lost to history's torn-off pages, kept the promise to heart. In time he became a skilled navigator, having served faithfully in the Scoshan Marine for many years. With the backing of old friends and the "Alban Society", he purchased a sturdy ship, provisions, and the men to man it. So did he proclaim to Halafacks Square: they will depart Eastwards beyond the Ocean, where a land awaits forever green for the sons of Always-White.\n\nMany scoffed and jeered at the tomfool so eager to join a hundred other hopefuls beneath the waves. But some had revealed themselves kindred souls, from many backgrounds, and joined the ambitious expedition. They departed in the fog of morning, heckled and encored in equal measure.\n\nNo one knew the fate of the Victory and her Hundred Braves. Anyone with an opinion filled the blanks as their fancy dictated: either they reached the promised land, or the Ocean smote them for their hubris. Nevertheless, the voyage became talk of taverns and halls across the land; whether or not it succeeded, the navigator and his men are assured to live forever as one of many great legends from the early days of Ka-na-da."

First, a bright, burning light illuminated the ship as if a million spotlights had been trained on it. McDougall had no time to comprehend this before a blast from afar rocked the ship and tore apart the hull. McDougall barely understood what was happening, but he knew what he had to do. He ordered all men off the ship. He organized a swift gathering to the lifeboats. One by one, his crew embarked. After the last men had gotten away safely, McDougall cut the boat's line's loose and remained aboard. The last his crew saw of him, he was lighting up one last cigarette and flicking the match into the leaking oil.\n\nThe crew would soon make it to a southerly island between two greater lands.

However, in a world sent backwards in time thanks to the power of destruction, a symbol can all to easily become a reality, as it in fact did. When the first king of our small portion of Albion adopted the mantle of the old legend King Arthur, he could hardly have anticipated the consequences of his decision. When people are desperate, they may turn to even the strangest of sources for comfort, and when the people came to see the hero-king Arthur, the king saw no reason to disabuse them of their mass delusion.\n\nNow, as living things eventually do, the king died, and the news caused panic amongst the people who had viewed this self-proclaimed legend as their divinely guided protector. It was then that the son of the king made a fateful choice. He donned the robes of his father and addressed the crowds of his subjects who stood nervously at the castle gate. King Arthur was not dead at all, for he was now King Arthur. Just because the holder of title was gone did not mean the title was meaningless or hollow.\n\nKing Arthur was an idea, a model for just leadership and righteous authority. In time, the house of that first king would fall from grace; they had abused their power and position and were no longer fit to hold the role of Arthur. Many more families would at some point or another take possession of the right to hold the title, but all would eventually be found wanting. At last, it was determined that as a true leader of the people, the Arthur should be accordingly chosen from among the people themselves. To be called Arthur is to be the defender of all, it is a responsibility that few are worthy to bear, and yet anyone can, if they commit themselves to a life of selfless devotion to our beloved nation."

It was a grandstanding, and rather egotistical, nickname, but the group could not help but go along with it. For the man commanded... a certain aura.

The growth of their harvests preceded the growth of their numbers, and soon, an impressive length of the Great River, North of the Old City, was lined with dozens of hamlets.\n\nOver decades, the hamlets gave way to villages gave way to towns gave way to a city. A New City, filled with new people who never knew the world before the war. Despite this ignorance, they held on to their past, and their traditions. As the Old City was built over and the settlements long since united, these people had a realization. What once was lost, may someday be found. A council of the city's greatest was summoned, to determine her future. So they determined. Her future would be as her past. What was once called Polska lska would be reborn."

This was the end, and his work had just begun. Standing from his desk, he walked down the cavernous, chilly hallway towards the seed vault. He knew every inch of the massive warehouse, where each and every plant species known to humanity was stored. There were so many he could name from memory alone: over a thousand plant species had been catalogued from nearly every nation. Authoritarian or free, capitalist, communist, fascist, whatever; most nations sent seeds as a last contingency.\n\nErik wondered what seed he should choose as the first to be planted again. He had no access to tropical areas as of yet, so any plants native to that area were out of the question. Scandinavian cold narrowed the shortlist further, and the need to thrive in more temperate areas winnowed the field to a few choice candidates. Wheat, the first crop ever grown by man, would be poetically fitting, but there was no true way to know the best choice.\n\nWalking into cold storage, the superchilled air caressed Erik's face, and he realized that it did not matter which plant he chose; it would be years before any were planted.

The cars left a trail of dust behind them as their wheels grinded against the dry ground. The rough terrain made them constantly go up and down as they raced, and the heat was intolerable. But neither crew would give up, for this was their last chance. Initially, the decorated black car was in the lead, and the distance between the two kept growing. The racers drifted around the rock, creating a large beige-brown cloud that reduced their visibility. The black car grabbed the opportunity, ramming into their opponent, but that achieved little in the end.\n\nThe finish line was clearly in sight. It was right there, no more than a thousand feet away. That was when the black car's engine began coughing, occasionally at the beginning and constantly as they continued. The opponent took the lead, and was coming closer to the finish line. Slowly, the black car ground to a halt. The crew came to the obvious conclusion. Gasoline had ended and, as they could see their opponent winning, taking the last tank and leaving with it in the distance, there would be no more fuel.

Some went back to their hiding spots to continue their life in isolation, far from the civilized world. Some simply took the weapons they had used to kill others for years, and turned them against themselves. A few, who saw beyond their own survival and satisfaction, remained in the areas, to care for those that had suffered and help piece the old world back.

A few of them were skeptical, but most were embarrassed to remember they'd never formally taught their kids much of anything other than how to work, and agreed to her modest terms.\n\nMiss Jackson's curriculum seemed very disorganized, if it even existed at all. Every day she'd gather up the kids from all the houses who were pitching in for her lodging and pool them all together in some ruined old building she had halfway cleaned up a room inside of, to serve as her classroom.

Miss Jackson gave the boy a kindly smile and explained to her class that people used to make tall buildings so they could fit more rooms in a smaller space; back then, space was at a premium, and buildings had to be tall so they could make good use of the spot of space they had. Weeks later, one of the older girls asked her what people used to wear before the world ended, and Miss Jackson calmly explained that they wore most anything they could think of to wear, and that crazy new ideas for clothes swept everyone up in a frenzy every new season to buy all the latest clothes, even if their old ones hadn't worn out. One of her students never asked Miss Jackson any questions, though, and on her last day before leaving town, Miss Jackson decided to single out the quiet boy and ask him what he wanted to know about the old world.\n\nThe boy paused and kept silent for awhile, but eventually he asked, "Miss Jackson, why were all the people back then so silly?".\n\nMiss Jackson smiled, and she told the boy, "They were all so silly because they didn't have me around to teach them.""

Her army was the grandest in the world, and it was an attempt to destroy it that ended the old way of humanity, and reduced our ancient cities to ruin. Germania achieved such strength because she was a mother with many children, who used the best traits of all of them to maintain her preeminence in the world. So many small parts of this old empire all called Germania mother, but each of them still knew that they were their own lands with their own identities.\n\nOne of the most astounding of these children of Germania was Wien, in the south, who held sway over all the land where the mountains rise. Another was Salut, in the west, an estranged sister of Germania, where the people spoke a different tongue from the rest of Germania's daughters. One more was the land of Han, whose founder was the namesake of all men named 'Han' today. He was a legendary sailor from the far north, where the ground ends and the world sea begins, who once made a journey by boat to conquer another land--the island of Britannien--as a gift to Germania.\n\nThough the people of all these countries understand their common lineage from mother Germania, they do not still call themselves brothers and sisters. The Bavars fight ferociously against the tribes of the Wien for their continued independence from them, even as they would call them cousins. So too is it with the rest of what was once Germania: her children have grown up, and share all the same rivalries any two family members might.

Now, it was set to be the launching of their big follow-up tune and it was wished upon by many that they could hopefully surpass their last hit.\n\nAs the band started up, the sound they played conveyed an impending doom using a series of weird, diminished chords.

Instead of training however, the group were so confident in their abilities that they spent most of their time in the bunker partying and drinking. They even ignored what time they were supposed to arise from the bunker to reclaim the land, to instead spend more drunken nights in the cozy shelter.\n\nWhen they finally arose from the bunker after exhausting much of their supplies, they lazily grabbed their weapons and equipment and psyched themselves to stomp any savage who would dare stand in their way. It would be easy pickings most of them thought, how could it not be? They were the chosen ones after all.\n\nAfter opening the bunker door, it only took a couple of steps out in the open for the squad commander to stumble over a tripwire and be blown to smithereens. The rest of the squad, shell-shocked and stunned, were like fish in a barrel for the assortment of hidden away young men and women who gunned down the SS troopers with reckless abandon. Decked out in plain black garbs and tucked away in trees and bushes, the would be future of the Aryan race was nothing short of obliterated by the young guerrillas.\n\nAs one survivor gazed up at the group who had surrounded his near dead body, their faces lacking any empathy for the soon to be deceased man, he could only think to ponder the fate of his homeland now that these degenerates had seemingly come to rule it. Before he could even begin to preach these malicious dying thoughts to the group of youngsters, he was promptly shot straight in the head and left for the vultures along with the rest of his SS squad."

He had next to nothing, suffering from the afflictions of malnutrition and old age, and could only pray the Baron was not too viscous towards his daughter.\n\nAs the Baron sat down at his desk after a long day of riding round and checking up on the plantation, his afternoon coffee was abruptly interrupted by the thuds of boots against wood. His door suddenly burst open and the Baron was soon confronted by the sight of 5 men, their faces covered up with red balaclavas, armed to the teeth with an assortment of guns. The armed band then suddenly riddled The Baron with a hail of bullets, shattering his mug of coffee and leaving the man little more than grisly looking carcass.\n\nThe commotion soon attracted the attention of the peasants living on the land who climbed up to the large hill and into the Baron's estate. By the time they reached his office, the band was long gone with only the Barons bloody body remaining. The old peasant soon discovered his daughter in one of the Barons many rooms, clutching a note apparently left by the armed men.

What instead occurred was a peaceful and pleasant sit down, where compromises were agreed and ideological questions were thankfully settled to meet people's real world needs.\n\nCathalaunia would later become a shining light in the region which sometimes still lived up to the legacy of its violent past. As a hotbed of intellectual discovery, prosperity and peace, Cathalaunia would thankfully signal an abandonment of its dark past.

The seat of Saint Peter was vacant, and the literal seat was incinerated in nuclear fire.\n\nAll the priests in the area gathered together in the Fiore family's barn, the only space big enough to hold them all.

A century later, from the same direction as the first great waves, the raiders had arrived in their long, fast ship, bristling with guns that could destroy a village from beyond the horizon. From their steel stronghold far distant from the shore, they could strike forth at a moment's notice, razing a village to the ground before pillaging its entire harvest in a matter of hours.

He wondered what those people who had caused such destruction that none could even tell how that destruction had been wrought had lived. Perhaps they had all lived in luxury, never knowing toil at all, and this disconnection from the process of life was what caused them to destroy themselves. Or maybe they had lived so fiercely and barbarically that such destruction seemed to them as perfectly normal. Who could say?

Since that day, the two had experienced an inexplicable but almost natural longing to ride the heavens as the old ones did.\n\nTheir work lay before Korren now. The motor engine, a technology only recently reclaimed from the ravages of time, rumbled from within its innards. Four canvas wings, fashioned together by Debyra's own hand, stretched out ready to catch the whirlwind. And in the cockpit carefully designed by Korren over countless sleepless nights, Debyra lay flat on her chest, playfully teasing her brother's endless fussing - though an undercurrent of nervousness colored her tone as well.\n\nThe time was finally upon them. Upon the Peaks of Copper in the land of the Great Lakes, their machine prepared to take flight. Korren stepped back, praying to the Supreme that his sister be delivered safely to their shared goal, just as Debyra began to throttle forwards. The machine rattled towards the steep cliff edge, and like a tottering infant it hurtled off into the sky. Korren drew sharp breaths as he began to fear an error, a misjudgement, some missed and crucial detail that would send his sister careening to her doom.\n\nBut it worked. By the blessings of the Supreme and the Holy Lamb Korren watched as his sister soared. It was but for a few seconds, but as she tasted flight for the first time in countless generations, Debyra's cries of joy echoed out across the fields. Racing to catch up with the machine as it landed roughly but safely upon the ground, Korren embraced his sister, knowing that while much still needed to be done, they had made the first step towards taking back the sky.\n\nFor a brief moment, Debyra had the sensation of being watched from above. Almost as if generations long-dead were smiling upon them. It was a strange feeling, but a hopeful one."

He watched from the top of the hill his church sat upon, down at the lights of the city far, far away. It was so peaceful on these nights, enough for him to forget the constant fear and anxiety that permeated every facet of the last few months. There was no worry about war tonight, only the comforts of freedom and the comforts of the Lord.\n\nHe didn't see the bombers, but he heard them. He thought they must have been from the airport at first--but planes never flew over his hill. Then he thought it was a military exercise. They did seem to be on the highest alert lately. Maybe it was...\n\nThe flash cut him off.\n\nHe flung his hands in front of his eyes and fell backwards out of his chair, lying in the dirt for a moment, blinking fitfully in a futile attempt to clear the blinding white haze that obscured his vision. He wanted so badly to simply lie there forever, to not look upon what awaited him, but he knew that he had to do it. He wearily brought himself to his feet, quaking fearfully, and waited until his eyesight had cleared. What he saw before him caused his heart to drop to his stomach.\n\nThe cloud was the first thing he noticed. They hadn't been lying when they said it was like a mushroom. It was exactly like one, really, but made of fire, dreadful fire, and a thick black smoke that could blot out the sun. He looked down, and all that was before him was rubble and fire.\n\nThis was hell, he realized then. It had to be hell. How could a God be good and allow this? He sank to his knees as he watched, thinking of the families he attended. He thought of the children--how terrified they must have been, in their final moments, before they were consumed by that damned fire.\n\nThe ground quaked beneath him as the smoke rushed towards him from the horizon, but he didn't care. The nightmare would be over soon.\n\nAs hellfire washed over Father Jacobs, he cursed God for letting his children die so cruelly."

 RAD_NA.9.desc:0 "The sands of what had once been the Sonoran were silent for many years after the last bomb fell. Too many to count. Sure, life had endured in the form of a few scattered tribes and gangs, but that was only a pale shadow of the great works that had been built in these dunes years before. The people didn't build, didn't create, didn't dream. They only survived, and they often failed at even that.\n\nAnd so it was for many years, until all at once, civilization rose over the desert once more. The people of the desert, in ancient times so bitterly divided over land, resources, culture, and class, had at last begun to come together to create something entirely new.\n\nNot all was peaceful--bandits still roamed the sands, and the desert was as hot as ever--but the young nation survived. It spread across the deserts of what had once been called southern Arizona, creating a new language, new tools, and new artwork. An independent national identity emerged, for a fledgling young nation.\n\nThe greatest discovery of all was the ruins of a city, right underneath the sands. The people of the desert settled there, in the ruins, and resolved to rebuild it. They would keep building on the pattern of the old, until the city was greater than it had ever been in life. They would finish the great work their ancestors had spent their lives building, and create a new home for their new people.\n\nTo this task they applied themselves wholly, and for generations they labored, and their society grew. Using the tools left by those who came before, they learned once more of science, mathematics, art and beauty. The ash and dust that had once covered the city's streets and buildings slowly faded away, and eventually the lights and signs would once more illuminate the night skies of the desert. The people of the Sonora gazed upon their work with awe, and christened it with the name their ancestors had given it, named for a being that would always rise from the ashes of its death and begin anew. One day they would fall, they knew, but they also knew that life would rise from those ashes, and that was a comfort."

The ancient maps had all been long forgotten, and the stories their elders had passed down spoke only of great sadness and fear to the far east, across this seemingly endless sea. He had believed the stories when he was young, as all of the children did. But when he came of age, something changed inside of him. He wasn't content to fear the unknown, he didn't want to live in ignorance anymore. He would find the east, and see its supposed terrors for himself.\n\nAnd so the young man found himself a crew. It was not so difficult these days as it once had been; large ships and smaller canoes regularly ran along the coast, transporting goods, and many of their crews felt the same wanderlust he did. He searched for a time for a suitable ship, and in the end one was built with the aid of the local elders and the blessings of the holy men. And so they set off.\n\nTheir spirits were high at first. The wind was in their favor, and the mythical east was surely only a few days away. When a week passed and they saw no land, despair slowly began to creep into their hearts, but still they pressed on. They had to know what was out there, even if it killed them.\n\nA month passed, then another, and their food stores were beginning to wane. Some among the crew suggested turning back, even though they all knew they didn't have enough food for the journey that way either. And so they pressed on, though their stomachs ached and their throats grew dry.\n\nWhen all hope seemed lost, one of the sailors waited until the dead of night and crept his way to the bow, thinking that if only he threw himself off the ship, his misery would end much sooner. He had put his foot on the railing when his eyes widened, and he ran backwards, shouting "Land! Land! I see land!"\n\nBefore the boat could lay anchor on the coast of this new, strange place, canoes had already disembarked and brought the explorers to the green shores. And so, for perhaps the first time in years, the people of what was once the Americas would set foot on the soil of the former Old World."

A once proud society laid low by their own terror and angst, they bickered, fought, and slaughtered their own friends and family in the name of just one more day of survival.\n\nThere was only one source of hope and happiness in those dark times: the stories. As was the case with so much else, no one could remember where they originated--no one even knew how they started, or why they were originally told, but it didn't really matter.\n\nThe stories told of ancient heroes, such as the Stark, a man made of iron; Odinson, a man who could control the sky itself; and The American, the truest of all heroes, a man with an invincible shield that protected the innocent. Together, these champions of mankind were said to defend the villages of the innocent and burn the camps of the evil. They weren't gods. They weren't even real, everyone knew that. Yet the stories were beloved regardless.\n\nThese stories united the shattered remnants of the toppled leader of the free world in their hope, and ever so slowly, people began to wonder about what could be, to dream of a better future. At times it seemed like there wasn't a village you could enter without seeing children dashing to and fro, swinging hammers or makeshift shields made of bundled sticks. Even the old were caught in the whirlwind.

So many had perished in the flames of war, and so many had perished in the years of suffering after, that it was simply impossible for most to believe there was nothing after death. And so, a strange tradition began to snake its way northward, from the distant deserts of what was once Mexico. At first, many survivors in the north feared the dead, telling their children stories of vengeful ghosts and ghouls that would steal them away in the night. Beware the dead, they would say, for their unbeating hearts are filled with jealousy for the living, and will gladly drag you down to hell with them.\n\nBut this strange new tradition said otherwise. It spoke of a day where the dead returned to Earth, but not to avenge themselves upon the living. No, the dead returned to view their descendants with gentle smiles upon their faces, to see the world's progress since the end.\n\nThe custom had many names. The oldest spoke of it as 'dia de los muertos', their children called it the Day of the Dead, and their children after them called it The Day the Dead Walked.\n\nRegardless of the name, the peculiar tradition spread throughout the north. Once a year, every year, the people would celebrate those that no longer walked the Earth with them, giving them food, offerings, and telling stories of their exploits: celebrating the lives they had, not mourning the deaths they suffered.\n\nWithin a matter of decades, every year on the anniversary of The War, the people of North America celebrated those who had perished so tragically in the flames.

A horror story told to children who refused to go to sleep all across former America, perhaps, but that didn't make it any less true, to the horror of any brave souls who dared to travel there. No one quite knew how it had started, but the fact remained that a local Warlord had on his person a cache of great and terrible weapons that was said to sear flesh from bone, slaughter hundreds at once, and more terrible things. But his greatest joy was a single weapon, which he called a "nook", that was said to incinerate cities in one single strike. Some said he was a warlock and could open portals to Hell itself, some said he was a brilliant scientist who had harnessed the power of the very Sun, but the eldest of Mountazhnia said the man was merely lucky, and had stumbled upon a treasure trove of weapons from an age long forgotten.\n\nThe fear of these weapons kept the people in line, and the terrible warlord took advantage of this, declaring himself the king of Mountazhnia, ruling with an iron fist. If any spoke out, or even showed the slightest dissent, their own villages would tear them apart out of fear of the King and his great weapons.\n\nAfter years of suffering and torment, finally, the dam broke. First one man stood outside of the King's fortress, rake in hand. Then another man joined him - and another. Eventually, hundreds - thousands stood outside the gate, waiting for their demise. But nothing happened.\n\nEmboldened, they stormed the fortress, and on that day, the "King" of Mountazhnia was brought down, his claims of unstoppable weapons proved false."

Some built their homes in it, some worshipped it, and some tried to emulate it - the ruins of these imitations can be seen today, albeit at the bottom of the sea. But the city of Freigh was born from these attempts, as slowly, but surely, civilization thrived in the ruins of the once great beast.

Expecting to see a local, James was shocked when he was greeted by the faces of two complete strangers, a man and a woman. Before he could so much as utter a simple "Good morning", the couple chimed in. "Please, do you have any fuel? Any at all? We'd be completely in your debt!" the man said in a dangerously maddened singsong. "Well, not much I'm afraid. The gas station is just down that-a-way, about a ten minute walk.

More intriguingly, structure appeared to carry several smaller structures resembling a metallic settlement upon its platforms, but the platform could not be reached without excessive effort and delay.\n\nAs the ship and her crew later arrive in port, they talk vividly of their discovery.

Yet they lacked the means to create such currency -- how, then, could one hope to radically shift the economy of their realm?\n\nMen find a way in time, as with all things.

For years the toils continued, with heaps of coins of all three stored in preparation for their debut.\n\nLong after the proclamation declaring these coins as legal tender, the kingdom soon found itself having become the nexus of the "Coinage Trade". Men became merchants day by day with the influx of wealth and goods across great distances which the trade had brought about.

 RAD_NA.25.desc:0 "The Most Ancient and Honourable Order of the Steel Men would come to be known as one of the greatest warrior orders of the post-Fall era. The mythos of the group stretched all the way back to the times of old, where the Associated Leagues of the ancients had birthed their noble line to pit them in an endless battle against other such groups in the pursuit of the gods' favor. The ancient tales would be of little interest to most, however - the order's feats in the modern age would be a legacy unto themselves.\n\nIt is said that as the Fall was in motion, the Steel Men had been locked in a fierce duel with their ancient rivals, the Cowmen of Dallas. Yet as the world burned around them the two foes joined forces for a time, to aid the men of the fallen city of Pitt. Men and women were granted shelter in the colosseum that had played host to their duel, from the mobs and thieves and fires and floods surrounding them, and from that day onwards the Steel Men would vow to fight for the people in a world gone to darkness.\n\nClad in their black and gold regalia, the Order fought against those who had rejected their humanity in the wake of the end, protecting the weak from those who would seek to exert their will over them. Many of those they protected would come to join their ranks, and the Steel Men would grow into a formidable fighting force. Their legend would only grow; mothers would tell their children bedtime stories of the Men's defence of the Apple from mighty behemoths, fathers would inspire their sons with the tales of their assault upon the Vikings in the northlands. Men became heroes, heroes became legends, and in time the scum of the continent would come to dread the day that they learned that the ancient Steelers were coming for them.\n\nLike most legends, their story would come to an end. The Mad King of Michiana - not yet fully known for his lunacy - would play a most devious trick upon them, and lure them into a trap where his men would slaughter their forces to a man, though not before they inflicted ten cuts for every blow dealt to them. In the end, only treachery could bring the mighty warriors to their graves, and the dead would be remembered in glory forever. Countless knightly orders would invoke their legacy, legitimate or not, and tales of their deeds and courage would be told for countless generations."

Pushed until there was nowhere left to run and slaughtered without abandon, those who survived were either forced to take up the conquerors' masks of language and habit or be cast into prisons called "reservations," where their masters could freely abuse them and deny them a share of the land's bounty.\n\nBut in the end, the greed of the conquerors and their like-minded rivals became their undoing, and the world was reborn in the Seventh Fire. It was not without cost, for the oppressed burned as much as the oppressors did. But when at last the smoke cleared, the empire the masters had built was in ruins, and the gates of their prisons lay open. Gingerly, carefully, memories of the tragic past still burning in the back of their minds, the first men of the continent stepped out into a new world.\n\nSome scattered to the winds, looking to find a new place for themselves in an uncertain future. But others remembered where they had come from, and decided that the time was right to reclaim what had been lost. They willingly walked the trail that their ancestors had been made to walk in blood; this time, however, they were not going away. They were going home.\n\nNone of them knew what would happen once they returned to their old lands. Would they find hope, renewal and peace? Would they be able to restore their ancestors' legacy or be forced to build a new one from scratch? Would they return to being rulers of the lands, or would they be contented with living in a more equal harmony with the others? Time would reveal the answers, but as the indigenous men and women of the continent crested the hills and the valleys gazed upon lost homes for the first time in countless generations, one thing was certain.\n\nTheir destiny was finally their own once again."

Then a city-state in its own right. The people of the city grew rich in trade, and some of its inhabitants ventured inside the depths of the mountain in search of mineral wealth. People began climbing the mountain, living on it, driving past it, and flying over it. The mountain silently watched it all.\n\nOne day, the mountain was bathed in fire. The city in the valley was reduced to craters and empty husks. The few who survived fled to the mountain, hoping to find sanctuary that wasn't there. They succumbed, and their bleached bones were buried by wind and ash. The mountain silently watched it all.\n\nAs time passed, the scars of the earth were painted over.

Their great cities built on stolen land were consumed in a great conflagration. Many of the Mohawk also lost their lives in this terrible calamity; yet some held on. Not many. But enough. Enough to begin filling the land once more. Enough to keep necessary traditions alive.\n\nOne of the most valuable traditions was that of the Three Sisters. The growing of squash, corn, and climbing beans in rotating cycles. These crops work in harmony with one another. The maize provides a tall plant for the beans to climb up. The beans enrich the soil with nitrogen. The squash covers the ground to prevent sunlight from allowing weeds to grow, and further retains moisture in the soil and deters pests. These plants work in symbiosis with one another and combine their strengths to produce a bountiful harvest for the Mohawk nation.\n\nAnd so, with the land once more in the hands of its traditional stewards, it slowly began to flourish once more."

The name of the man so wondrous that such a monument could be built to him was lost to time, having possibly been struck from the monument as early as the End itself. But the collective memories of the old lands would fill in the gaps.\n\nIt is said he was a liberator, a great uniter who struck down a terrible insurrection against his rightful rule. He lent his aid to King Martyn Luther to both free the people from chains and to drive the greedy Romans from the church. He was attacked and mortally wounded by two men hiding in a theatre and on a grassy hill, and yet he still rose again to push for liberty and justice for all the people of the land. He represented truth, freedom, emancipation from slavery and the unity of man throughout all nations. All this and more would be attributed to the figure, who would simply come to be called the Emancipator.\n\nThe years and the elements would slowly wear away at the monument. From time to time, orders and societies would emerge that would attempt to keep the old stones maintained. Men would travel from all over the continent to see it, make offerings and give thanks, even as the old world faded into myth. Time claims all things, however, and as the ages wore on the statue would become more and more degraded, with the head being stolen from it sometime during the later period of the Kolumbyin Republic. Eventually, the statue itself would be lost in a great fire, crumbling to barely recognizable rubble under a pile of collapsed scaffolds.\n\nA great wonder of the world was lost, but the Emancipator's legacy lived on in the hearts and minds of men.

Law and order had collapsed as soon as innocent cities fell prey to the terrible bombs of empires long gone. Civilization collapsed in the chaos following the exchange, and with it the securities many have taken for granted. Those who survived were left to the tender mercies of cruel, evil men, who jumped at the chance to profit off of the battered land's misery.\n\nBut silver lines every gathering of stormy clouds, no matter the shade. Like knights come to rescue the beloved princess, heroes stepped up against the reign of chaos and anarchy that had gripped their homeland. Wearing colorful masks of blues, whites, and reds, these "luchadores" earned fame and the people's undying love as they battled banditos and thugs with the secret art of "La Lucha Libre".\n\nAsk an old abuelo and they will tell you of the luchadores' exploits with the excitement of children eight times their junior. Of how El Santo singlehandedly ended the Tres Marias with his legendary Slam-of-Choke. Of how Mil Mascaras defended Ciudad Rosas from rogue vaqueros by delivering devastating planchas from great heights. Of how the infamous Blue Demon, warlord of the Rio Norte, redeemed himself by forming a "tag team" with El Santo to defeat Comandante Anna, thus bringing lasting peace to all of Mehica. Tall tales, an outsider may say, but they swear to their family name: everything they said was real. They were sure of it.\n\nThrough action, man becomes legend; through the passing of time, legend becomes myth. Tales grow and shrink in size as they pass from generation to generation -- the feats of many may instead become the feats of one.

Unable to control himself, he began to run towards the streaking object.

He did not care, for none who see the face of God shall live. Standing blindly in place, arms outstretched, he recited the verse to all who may hear it, "And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth."\n\nAnd so the vials were poured, and Keith was no more."

Squat and slightly collapsed, it sat along the steelroad's edge. More interesting, however, was not next to the steelroad, but sitting upon it. A vast object, split into multiple interconnected pieces, enforcing its weight upon spindly looking metal wheels.\n\nThe Traveler was intrigued. He had heard of these curiosities before, 'Treyns', they were called. Massive steel vessels that could supposedly carry hundreds and move with the speed of the wind. Fantastical nonsense, he always thought, but there it was; rusted to bits but still intact. He pressed his horse forward to get a closer look.\n\nThe wormlike-vehicle was extremely long, at least 300 paces, and its vast steel body was segmented into at least quint carriages. The Traveler had to see the head of this metallic beast, and perhaps divine what Gods must have built it.\n\nDismounting his horse, the Traveler entered the head carriage. The entire compartment was filled with dials and levers and gauges beyond counting. On the floor of the magnificent machine, lay the shattered skeleton of a man, rotted clothing still hanging from its bones. The Traveler knew, then, that there were no Gods. Not any more.

It had been less than two hours since the White House was evacuated. Clyde, her husband, was gone, likely killed beneath rubble or turned into dust. All she was President of anymore was dust and a hundred million dead souls.\n\nWithout a word, she motioned for the guards to leave; she needed to be alone. They promptly heeded her order, robotically opening the single exit and stepping outside the claustrophobic office space. This was her own fault. All that work to strengthen America, make her great once more, and all Smith reaped of that work was the death of everything she ever cared about.\n\nIn a few hours, she would have to give a broadcast speech to a dead nation, and claim that America would somehow recover. Find some bright side to this mess. She pondered for a moment, and realized that notion disgusted her. No, she would not speak to the nation. There would be no President to speak.\n\nReaching into the desk at which she sat, Smith retrieved a pen, paper, and a 1911 pistol. She always carried personal protection. Now it would achieve the antithesis of its purpose. Laying out the paper on her desk, she wrote a single sentence, placed the pen down, and pointed the pistol's barrel at her temple.\n\nAs the shot rang out through the Presidential Bunker, Secret Service kicked in the door of the President's office to find no killer, only a dead woman and a sheet of paper.

The Peacemaker brought together the people of the valley, showing them what they were doing to one another. He showed them the fields in which they buried their dead, rows upon rows of the aftermath of mothers burying sons, who themselves had interred their fathers, who had most likely mourned lost brothers.

I was in close contact with the dean. It was terrible, the wound. He had been shot straight through the thigh. There was nothing I could do.

One way or another, all agreed that these lands came to be dominated, for a considerable time, by men who called themselves vaqueros.\n\nThe vaqueros were men skilled in the handling of the surviving horses, a priceless means of transport. They were instantly recognizable from their wide brimmed hats and ornate ponchos, to keep the fallout dust at bay. Their primary job was herding surviving livestock, the sheep and cattle who had not perished in the calamity but had gone feral in the absence of their owners. After re-domesticating the beasts, the vaqueros would drive them across the wilds, in keeping with grazing seasons and to protect them from the marauders common in the post-calamity wilderness. Their meat and dairy were precious sustenance, sustaining not only the vaqueros' livelihoods but also the communities struggling to survive living off the sickly, irradiated lands.\n\nIn time the soil would grow fertile again, leading communities to grow and form something resembling a new civilization, with settled ranches and livestock breeding allowing the need for the vaqueros to fade.

The island paradise that we hoped to live out our days in peace upon turned out to be a fetid, tropical hell.

Now I am alone, dressed in navy blue rags and a patchwork cloak of Japanese fatigues. And, alone at last, I can finally tell you the truth. The truth is that I killed them, and us. I turned the key that launched the first strike. It was in my hands, and mine alone, for Billings would not make that choice himself.

The fury that rained down on the cities and towns of the land, purging them of life, saw fit to spare the small farm villages of this tribe, removing from their young the siren call of the modern world and allowing them to grow and expand into the open countryside at their leisure.\n\nThe Dukhobortsy, as they called themselves, spoke a language extremely foreign to any other spoken in this lands, even writing it in a foreign script that their neighbouring tribes could not begin to understand. Their ancestors taught them that they came to these lands from across the sea, fleeing a tyrant in the era before the Great Blinding. Their ways were nearly lost to them, the words of ancient chants bleeding away with each generation as ever more of their kin adapted to the customs of the more numerous tribes around them, abandoning the old way.\n\nThe blinding reversed this, sundering the tribes that once held sway over the Dukhobortsy and turning those tribes' own families to look at the spiritual warriors for salvation. The assimilated became the assimilators, and as foreign men and women adopted Dukhobortsy customs and took Dukhobortsy husbands and wives, new communes of this pacifistic, spiritual community began to spring up amidst the neighbouring plots of their older communities.

A cooperative of farmers, trading crops and equipment amongst each other, and eagerly taking in migrants from more devastated lands to work the fields for fair pay. When the cold winds came and made the land unusable, everyone would come together to keep themselves warm and breathing all winter, sharing fuel, blankets and company to maintain good spirits throughout the stolen half of the farming year.

In this most frozen and inhospitable of environments, at the beginning of the cold season, every year, the people of this wasteland strip themselves of their warm furs, take to an open spot in the ice... and go swimming.\n\nThere is no self-destructive intent amongst the revellers.

To some, their plunge into the water symbolizes their determination to outlive the winter, to brazenly face the cold and emerge alive again at season's end, just as they did from a frozen lake at season's beginning. To others, it is a foolhardy gesture of personal strength, proof that they are local to the region, and that their living here has given them the fortitude to survive this trial.\n\nFinally, to the most insane among those participating, it is an act of recreation. Some of these bizarre people insist that they participate in the plunge merely for fun, seeing neither historical nor symbolic significance in this semi-suicidal act of self harm. They are the ones who smile the widest when they emerge from the water, and who laugh and strike poses as their bodies are lost beneath the white waters beneath the ice, minutes away from death should their friends fail to save them. It is this attitude which most permeates the site of the ritual, turning this event of much archival importance into little more than a jovial game to play with friends.

His best bet was to hide down here, wait for the man to fall asleep, and then sneak out again once it was safe. As fate would have it, though, the homeowner was in quite a rush. Jesse heard loud footsteps moving across the house, as though the man was running. He wondered what the urgency could be, and then heard the footsteps get closer.

If I am never again able to create anything of value, does that bring peace to you whom I abandoned? That cannot be true, I pray that it is not true.\n\nWhen I am asked where I was when the bombs hit, when I am asked what I did to escape the death that caught up so many others, I wish I could give an honest answer. I wish I could say I acted with bravery and heroism. But you know I cannot and have not done either. I tell them that I happened to be in a position where I was relatively safe from the effects of those horrible explosions that shook the world in ways even they were never intended to. I do not tell them about all of the people I abandoned when they called out to me for help and salvation. You looked up to me, and I betrayed you all in order to survive. If I could reverse our fates, I would not hesitate to, but that is simply not possible.\n\nIt is time that I stopped letting these memories and this guilt consume my soul. I have a family now, I have a son. He is so innocent I am moved to tears. Would I have abandoned him too I wonder? It doesn't matter, what matters is: I will not abandon him now, I will never abandon anyone ever again. I will become a man worthy of the life I so cruelly stole from all of you.

The hunt was on, and a prime prey had just presented itself: a large four-legged creature that he remembered his father had taught him was called a "Buck". He had his trusty bow already at his side and an arrow in the other hand, ready to be fitted and fired for the kill at any time. It would only take a few more steps to be in the optimal range, but even so, the experienced hunter took his time to avoid scaring his target. As he carefully moved into the final position, his foot caught on something, something heavy, and he fell ignominiously onto the hard ground. The Buck bolted.\n\nThe hunter grunted in agitation, then turned around to examine what had caused him to fail in his hunt. At first all he saw was the same leaf-covered canvas the rest of the ground appeared to be, but as he began to sift through the piles of now disturbed foliage, his hands found purchase on a most peculiar instrument. It was very oddly shaped, with what appeared to be a grip of some kind towards the back, a long tube extending outward from the front and a curved block of wood from behind. He had never seen anything like it before. Out of curiosity, he brought it up so that the block rested on his shoulder. It felt surprisingly natural, but the hunter still had his doubts about the odd object. In front of the handle was a curved lever of some kind. With some apprehension, the hunter pulled it back.\n\nAn explosion deafened his hearing as a force pushed his entire body backwards several feet. He stumbled and dropped to his knees, his limbs shook like plants in a storm. What was this contraption? He looked toward where he had pointed it, and his eyes widened in shock as he observed that in a tree that had been in the same direction, a smoking hole had appeared. It seemed that this unusual creation had some sort of power to destroy at a level even his bow couldn't match. But so what? It was clumsy, far too clumsy for a hunter of his skill. The noise it emitted had likely alerted all living creatures within the forest, and what use was a weapon that fought back when used? A most unhelpful tool indeed, it seemed to this veteran hunter."

It was only because he, Bishop Alexander Phillips, had made an old friend in the military from his days as young priest that they even had a warning at all. It was thanks to the selfless act of that now almost certainly dead man that he was able to evacuate his Sunday school program. And now, one of those children was missing.\n\nHe ran down the school's hallway as fast as his old legs would carry him, praying with each step that he would find the boy in time. Another student had told the Bishop that James had gone back for something. Was it worth dying over? Obviously not, but the boy was only six after all, nuclear war wasn't something someone his age would easily process. He had almost given up when he found the child, standing nervously in the doorway, seeming as lost and out of place as a frightened calf. He scooped the boy up and with a strength that burned his old body he dashed back the way he came.\n\nHe thought they would make it, it was only a little ways left. Then the ground trembled with a violence man was not meant to know. He saw the open door of the shelter, several children crowded around the opening.

Also unlikely.\n\nHis search continued to net him more oddities, more smothered fires. A further day of searching found him at the entrance of what he guessed to have been an automobile factory. As he opened the door tentatively, he held his gun up, ready for any lurking man or beast.

Some had been lost to the heat and exhaustion, some to the pursuing slavers, and half a dozen had fallen during a scuffle with a gang of marauders they had chanced upon. Still, this forlorn, tattered group marched on, staking everything on a whisper of a rumor of a legend. A New Canaan. In the mines, the story had been passed down from the oldest man to the youngest little girl: a paradise of free slaves who were able to live together in freedom and harmony. A myth no doubt, but better to die in the pursuit of freedom than to go on surviving without actually living.\n\nStill, it couldn't be helped that, dream or not, the group was in a desperate situation.

In those six days, two of the group had passed from hunger, giving up their rations for the remaining children, a last act of heroic sacrifice.\n\nThe sign was dilapidated, only a few letters were visible, an 'S' here, a 'C' there, nothing more than those small clues.

The old sailor was known to his friends and family as a quiet and taciturn man, but if he could have gotten his hands on the fools who had rushed right past the precipice in an insane desire for national power, or retribution, or influence, or whatever other pathetic reasoning leaders of men invent to justify their actions, he wasn't sure he would be able to restrain himself.\n\nDid this mean that all of the men he saw die in the Pacific fell in vain?

He tried to search for some meaning in the madness as a second and then a third evil cloud appeared in the distance, but nothing came to him. No deeper meaning, no inherent truth or noble wisdom on the nature of man.

In a marvelous display of the magic the Templemasters loved to fawn over, the object was able to contain a memory of a long dead Ancestor, and if this vessel really was from the time just before the Sundering, then it was possible that the voice of a man hundreds of years dead was about to be heard.\n\n"...as stated previously, as captain of this ship, I was given direct orders to fire my nuclear ordinance. I have just disobeyed that order; I take full responsibility for all actions of this ship and her crew from this point onward.

I understand that this is a futile gesture, even if we disobey the order, other missiles and bombs will already be well on their way. Nevertheless, I can not participate in this madness..."\n\nThat was all that could be recovered from the Black Box, perhaps the magic had waned in strength over the years. What confused the Aquisitioner was the reference to 'nukes', some type of spell possibly?

Even if he could not understand all of the message, it seemed to contradict the Temple's doctrine significantly. He would need to investigate further, and then what?

Through clever tricks and deals, along with outright theft, the Baron had managed to accumulate a large stash of these powerful artifacts which he used to exact tribute and to police the slaves in his territory.\n\nAlways the type of man to personally abuse those he had power over, the Baron was fond of personally overseeing the slave labor he had mandated, and although he was outnumbered hundreds to one by those with every desire to see him as a corpse, the awe-inspiring power held by even one Fire Spear caused them to keep their resentment in check.\n\nIt was on one of these sadistic excursions that the Baron's luck finally came to a spectacular end. As he accosted one of the "underperforming" slaves, as was his usual, the recipient of his abuse decided that living in such a situation was bearable no longer. Fist connected to jaw, and the Baron tumbled backwards with a stream of curses and profanity. As he pulled himself back to his feet, he leveled his Spear at the defiant slave.

 RAD_NA.92.desc:0 "Ages ago, humankind fought an unending war with the very nature that it inhabited. The humans of the world in those ancient days would use and abuse the environment around them for their own depraved ends, caring nothing for the disastrous consequences their selfishness wrought-both for themselves, and for the other living, feeling beings around them. Mighty, verdant forests were cut down and burned to smolders, innocent animals of all kinds were tracked down to be savagely murdered, and great holes were carved out of the Earth by our simple-minded, primitive forebears, in a useless search for the worthless treasures they thought could be found beneath their feet. Evidently, whatever treasures they found were not enough to save them.\n\nThis age of war that scars our history was called 'civilization', and the Old Mothers tell us that it lasted hundreds of years, entire generations of humans living and dying only to be used as soldiers in the unscrupulous designs of the great foe that led humanity in that era: industrialists. The industrialists waged their campaign of civilization against the forces of nature with cruelty more extreme than any human alive could imagine; in the span of one lifetime, a landscape as far as the eye could see could be changed from a state of perfect equilibrium under the rule of nature, into a hellish nightscape of civilization. Where once stood a tranquil forest, all that would be left would be patches of grass, imprisoned and kept alive by their human masters as a symbol of status and prestige. So decadent were the industrialists that they would pride themselves on which of their kind could imprison the most nature, competing with each other over who could be most spiteful as to dementedly torture the greatest quantity of what was once undisturbed woods. Some of these sickening fiends would seek even greater perversions, turning nature itself into a tool of propagating civilization, perverting nature's gifts to sustain the disease of civilization. These most hedonistic and toxic acts went by a name that only the most brave among us deign to speak aloud: agriculture. The Old Mothers tell us that this unholy rite was what first brought our people away from the true path, and it is this depravity above all others that must never be repeated again.\n\nOf course, the effete and extravagant rule of the industrialists over humankind could not last. Their civilization system was too unstable and too dependent on the bounty earned by its conquest of nature to ever achieve the balance needed to last the ages. As civilization reached a critical mass, holding as its possession more of the Earth than was left for nature, the loot from further conquests became insufficient for civilization to sustain itself. The industrialists turned on each other, fighting with and sometimes even intentionally killing other humans over which method of conquering nature was most efficient, and how Earth's remaining riches ought to be divided. This infighting, the Old Mothers say, was the last act that ended the age of civilization. Using the weapons they fashioned for themselves from the hellish, arcane powers beneath the surface of Earth, they turned on each other and destroyed one another's industry, forgetting their common cause against nature and allowing the mother of Earth a reprieve from the industrialist banditry.\n\nMost of the humans who did not perish returned to nature, and would in the coming generations be educated by the wisdom of the Old Mothers. Teaching us to live off the land and to respect our fellow inhabitants of Earth, the Old Mothers brought us back from the brink of extinction, enabled by nature's grace to keep us alive. So great is nature's love for us that even after we would come as close as we could to slaying her, she could forgive us, and allow us to continue to hold a humble place in her great kingdom. Nature has given us mercy, the Old Mothers say, and we would be wise never to follow down the same path again that had once brought us so close to our end as a species. For, if we do, nature might not extend the gift of mercy a second time."

Chief among it was that of an ancient empire.\n\nThe man spoke of an empire that had almost conquered the known world. An empire whose mighty legions had marched out and bat away the miriad of tribes on its border as if they were nothing but insects. Of the mighty Emperor who had crossed the great river to seize control back from the effeminate senators and congressmen who had stolen it away, and of the brutal civil war and slow collapse that had ended it.\n\nAt the end of the night, the travelers went to their bedrolls to sleep, thoroughly unimpressed about the tales of this 'Empire State'."

East of the Empire state lies many petty kingdoms and tribes, each of whom maintains that it is the very height of postdiluvian breeding and decorum.\n\nFrom Bost to Burleigh-Tarn the people beat their chests and speak proudly of the upright and human dignity of their ancestry. Not even the meanest Potato-serf would dare claim a lineage that did not extend back to at least Christ-Columbus. Should the Emperor himself walk into their village they would not deign to spit at his feet, so young and weak his mere centuries of family seem to those arrogant antiquarians.\n\nIt was in my journeys through the Kingdom of Roads as a humble translator of primitive American that I came across what at first seemed a perfectly reasonable town in Providence. It was small, near the coast and seemed to contain some very impressive albeit unusual examples of pre-Imperial architecture. The style, as you know, favours high, round windows and curves decorated with non-Euclidean geometries.\n\nThe people seemed amicable enough, though wary of strangers in a way that suggested not the cool fear of a typical Roader but the hot, sharp fear of a mangy dog who hears the twang of an arrow in the distance. It was only on my third night of staying in the inn, the Hateful Artist, wherein I realised what was so dreadfully off about the whole place. Every plum one of them was a mutant. From the meagrest six fingered child to the bent backed loping forms of what could have been a woman or a deer once, now not even a doctor could tell I should wager.\n\nSitting there, I felt a cold fear run down my spine. A fear of the other, of a wrongness I had never realised I could feel until that moment.\n\nSo if you dear reader, like me, has lived in fear all his life of the mob, of the mutant-finder, of the strangers cruel glare, then make your way to the little town of Providence, in the Kingdom of Roads."

Atop it's back was a high fin, gird by black rings, and from it's back their also arose a tentacle. This tentacle was stiff and seemingly as dead as the rest of it, yet when a priest approached praying to the Christ-Columbus, it turned with a shivering squeak to bring a solitary square eye to bear upon him.\n\nEchoing whispers emanated from the beast in some tongue know one knew, yet they felt had a certain familiarity. With that, the priest fell, dead of fright. The townsfolk ran, ran from the tentacular eye, ran from the almost-language of the whispers, ran from the great deep one.\n\nThe night a brave man of the town went to spy on the beast, so they should know its purpose, yet when he got there he was frozen in terror at what he saw. From a circular mouth atop its back, two figures came out. Dressed all in black and pale as snow, thinner than any man he had ever seen before and staggering like a mad cow. They spoke in the strange, almost-language, and moaned in pain at the slightest effort.\n\nThe man understood, these were deep men, who spoke the deep speech of the lost city of Atlantis. They had come as priests of their mad lord, the deep one.\n\nKnowing the land was cursed, the people left the beach and the town, never to return. In time the whole coast became a haunted land, where not even the Empire State dared go, and the deep one remained ever vigilant, ever watchful."

She and her pack prowled on horseback or in rusted up engines--whatever they could find and use to move around quickly. They rode through soft rains and radioactive fallout, responding to no man but their prophet: the Messiah, whose voice was so deep and resonant that their words always seemed to be in prayer. The savior of the broken Jagunços, the beaten indigenous, and the damned. Those damned whose ancestors were brought to the New World in chains before being broken by the dynasty supposedly granted their reign by God. The damned just like her. The Antichrist that came to govern this vast nation may have summoned the harbingers of the end, but now she had come to deliver them from him. She was the Counselor.\n\nThe Black Guard rode for years until they arrived at the gates of what was once known as the Imperial City. When the Counselor arrived, the inhabitants huddled themselves in dilapidated homes, starving and godless, in a spiritual exile. Cathedrals stood with no priests, universities with no teachers, and men with no faith in their hearts. Searching for masses to be fed, she found an ancient palace at the center of it all. In these halls she found relics of what was lost to evil in the centuries before. She knew that fate ordained her to wear the ancient crown. The tattered flag, kept still in the museum for over a century of poverty and suffering, would fly once more.\n\nHer crusade would only come to an end many decades later, when her resurrected empire stretched from the Imperial City to the Saints Bay. On her deathbed, she whispered her last words to her successor: rule for the independence and freedom of all. Never again would there ever be slaves. For, as shattered as the world had become, all would once again be made equal upon the return of our Lord. There was no doubt that in the silent air, an immense archangel carried the Counselor into heaven above the city reborn."

Indeed, as the lights of the Earth went out, the heavens became only brighter in comparison, and for the first time in many decades the full splendor of the cosmos could be seen from anywhere in the world.\n\nIn time, man turned their attention back to the stars, first by gazing, then by wondering, and finally by refining. They reclaimed and restored the ancient far-seeing lenses, or else constructed ones of their own design, and began to map the heavens. In their observations, they began to note that certain stars seemed to wander through the skies, like cosmic travellers bound for unknown celestial climes. A word existed for these, though it had been lost in the Deluge, so men simply took to calling them Nomads.\n\nIn the lands of the Andes, a stargazer had become enamoured with one of these Nomads. Where others lazily drifted through the heavens, this one hurtled through the sky many times a night. He would erect his far-seer the moment after sundown to observe its passage, ruminating on its nature and purpose. Was it some lesser moon like the one that also stared down at him most nights? Was it just another star, granted unnatural speed by some divine or possibly eldritch force? Was it an angel? A god watching his flock?\n\nOne night, he got his answer. As he watched his Nomad crest the horizon, he saw with horror that it was aflame, its trail impossibly fast, and getting closer. Breaking into many burning pieces, it crashed down into the nearby mountains with an almighty boom. Racing to the site of impact, the stargazer gazed in awe at the strange and wondrous site before him. The Nomad was no natural object - it was a divine construct! The wreckage of rooms, passageways and incomprehensible instruments were evident in its form, but the greatest find was not the construct itself. It lay within - the skeletal remains of a celestial being."

At first, the outsider faced distrust from the indigenous community but he quickly proved himself capable when he showcased certain new techniques to the tribe. He had brought with him a vast array of inventive arts and knowledge-words that intrigued the tribal leaders enough to keep him around. The fact he had managed to ingrain himself into the culture of the tribe, whilst teaching them of these newfound tactics, was nothing short of a miracle. Yet he was said by some to be a man of miracles. Some of the more mystical Elders whispered he was a gift for the tribe from a higher power. Whatever he was, he was certainly useful now that the jungle had become home to various hostile outsiders who wished the tribe harm.\n\n"The work of a fighter never stops until the enemy lets up." said the Comandante to the youngsters that had huddled around him..."Your work is a protracted one and it is through your work that you will become known as a guerrilla. You will come to understand this term as we progress in your training. For now, I will demonstrate basic combat movements. Now... watch closely."\n\nThe young men and women were transfixed by Enríquez and his workings. He was effortless in his workings and described clearly and plainly what he wished from the youth. Maybe he was a gift after all - he had given this once isolated community a chance of survival in this ever-changing world. One could only wonder about his motivations, but the tribe was grateful anyhow. Was it not said that the weak took what help they were offered?

As the city began its slow crawl to normalcy, its leaders such as King Momo, Thirtieth of his Name, likewise began to rebuild what it had lost: roads, taxes, indoor plumbing... and the ancient festival called Carnaval.\n\nCustoms and ceremonies change shape and adapt under time's pressures.

It was a city in the middle of an entire continent no one hated enough to destroy, and if the men came with Bissonette, it would be theirs to plunder.\n\nAfter an arduous voyage, they had reached a tropical shore. By slowly hacking through the jungle, they battled their way up the great river. They reached a dilapidated small settlement, San Tar Aim. The few inhabitants left in that place signalled, in a language a shipmate from the lands once known as Iberia partly understood, that the great lost city they searched for was a long distance ahead. Therefore, they pressed on, battling currents and terrible tropical diseases along the way. For many miles, the only thing keeping the men from turning back was the fear that the way back was longer than the way forward. However, after all the struggling, and with only a quarter of their original expedition left, they made it.\n\nIt was beautiful. The city was far from full, but there was not a ruin in sight. The land was green with palm trees and crowds gathered to meet the strangers arriving on their shore. The bewildered and beleaguered expeditioners were received in open arms, and were quickly tended to with a great feast shortly after their arrival.\n\nThey came to this place, Man House, searching for plunder to take home. To their shock, what they sought was freely given to them.

And so the slopes went untouched, feeling only the gentle sun-kiss of distant thermonuclear blasts.\n\nAnd in time these mountains would become home to a mighty kingdom.\n\nThe people of this kingdom had once been called 'Sherpa', the people of the east.

It would be these skills that would transform them into the rulers of the heavens.\n\nUnconstrained by the old states that kept them down, the Sherpas would create a nation that linked the two sides of Asia separated by the great mountains, utilizing their unique knowledge of the mountains to guide traders through otherwise impassable terrain. As wealth from the other new kingdoms flowed through their lands, the Sherpas became the dominant force in the mountains, driving trade and commerce across the continent. Their markets became forces in their own right, and then competitors, and finally behemoths of trade greater than the sum of their rivals.\n\nAt the base of Jomolangma, a great capital would be built that would cement the power of the men of the mountains.

Though time and human fault have muddied the finer details of the story, its broad brushstrokes remain universally the same:\n\nIt is said that their ancestors, once members of a great many tribes, sought refuge from the Crimson Days in a tiny island.

All remembered the stories of impassable winds, dangerous demon-weapons from the Old World, and natives who disappeared into the jungle to return at night bearing sharp fangs and sharper knives the Teachers had taught them. The monks whispered that the creatures on the other side of the sea had barely been human in the first place - what was the point of trading with near-animals?\n\nHe settled upon the creative use of mythology to persuade the Lordship of the expedition's importance. With the merchants he had agreed to pool funds with, Miyazaka and Mitsu, the young merchant appeared at the Province Court with a set of very expensive scrolls. All were pre-War, and all were written in the strange flowing set of characters whose interpretation had been lost to time. Some suspected it had something to do with the strange shapings of names in the tongues of the land, and how some namings with the same meanings were said in entirely different ways in court or marketplace. This was Ishiguro's lead: the Lordship was many things, but above all he was curious.\n\nThe Lordship listened patiently to the merchants' promise to return not just with wealth, but with the keys to understanding where the Forgotten Words had come from - and the power that came with reclaiming forgotten names. He agreed to fund the provisioning and the armaments for a convoy of five ships, to be sent to the lands beyond the Southern Diamond.\n\nMonths passed. Ishiguro now sat on the deck, watching the emerald landline in the distance grow ever closer. Details magnified and clarified, and became rivers and mountains and the sparkle of life. Ishiguro prepared the scrolls of calligraphy, a few trade goods from the sculpting and crafting centres of the Central Island, and set off with a few soldiers of the Guard on a little boat, to the shores of the Land of Blood and Gold. Chuugoku awaited, and with it the promise of reclaiming lost memory."

Iron horses that rode under the power of steam, great steel birds that could carry men to the skies, hulks of copper wiring that could be tricked into thinking - sufficiently comprehensible magic slowly parsed themselves back into technological theory, and then into reassuring fact, after countless generations of ignorance.\n\nIt was in the bay of Narasakai that the men of the New World discovered once more the methods of breaking apart the most fundamental building blocks of the universe, and wielding the unimaginable energy contained within. The mood of the men of the great institute was ecstatic as their Divine Heart came alive, its essence sustained by a carefully choreographed disintegration of the elements. The power contained within was comparable to that of the gods, enough to sustain the entire realm perhaps, enough to usher in a new golden era of peace, knowledge and progress for a thousand years and more.\n\nAs the men cheered, an almost imperceptible chill came over one of the researchers. An ancient, unbidden ancestral memory of a power that promised peace but brought only suffering unto untold ages. The man shuddered at the implication of the power that mortals had now been granted. Could men be trusted with the power of divinity? Did they even deserve it? And even if they did, would they use it wisely?\n\nAnd yet where there was fear, there remained great hope. Hope for not just the islands that were their home, but for every man, woman and child of the earth. If one Heart could be made, then others would surely follow, and the world would awaken to an age without want or scarcity. The dark era of the past no longer haunted the minds of men, and under the sunrise of a man-made star, they might finally know peace."

The slopes were covered by pockmark-like craters, while the eastward edge suddenly caved away close to the peak, as if a giant had taken a jagged bite out of the mountain itself. The pristine snow capping the summit accentuated the wounds gouged into the mountain against the cloudless sky.\n\nThe shrine priests had said ruefully that the mountain was the broken spirit of their ancestors, the Japanese, before the spears of light and flame had fallen from the sky, turning night into brilliant day and then an even longer twilight. Presumably, the spears had also defaced the mountain, scarring the spirit of the ancestors in the priests' legends and myths.\n\nFrom time to time, the villager would wonder what the mountain and world looked like when both were still whole. Relics of that time could be found just beneath the surface of the ash plains: a broken blade here, a cylindrical metal skeleton there, or the husk of a treaded iron tortoise, asleep in the soil. Many would bear a set of characters that the priests translated as "IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY, TAKIGAHARA GARRISON."\n\nThe villager shuddered. Despite its utopian abundance, the world that came before didn't seem to be a particularly enviable one, if its inhabitants devoted so much time and energy to killing each other. How perfect could the spirit of a people so consumed by war actually be?\n\nNo, the mountain was what it had always been. If it was the spirit of the villager's ancestors (and by extension, the villager himself), then any mention of scars or brokenness rang hollow. It was certainly not flawless - the giant's bite was too obviously unnatural - but it had weathered what terrible cataclysm that had annihilated his ancestors. Where only rusting relics bore witness to the warlike hubris of generations past, the mountain continued its stark repose, forever changed by the world's passing but renewed in its wake.\n\nIt was a clear winter's day, bordering on the cusp of spring. The villager began the walk down to the ash plains of Gotemba, in the shadow of the imperfect mountain and with the first shoots of new life sprouting beneath his feet."

One step, then another, and another, an eternal march to an unknown salvation. Not for him, but for the Boy, cradled by the Old Man's fragile frame against the uncaring elements. The Boy's parents died so that the Boy might live, even if the body of an invalid was all that remained to honor the parents' last wish: the boy must reach the other side of the mountain, through an endless, freezing climb, while seeing nothing but blurs through a wall of snow and hail.\n\nThe Old Man wore many layers, but the inexorable cold penetrated through all of them, seeping so deeply into his bones such that any sense of touch became dulled and distant.

They told stories of seas that went off into the distance, and of cities built upon the palaces of the gods. They told of godly tools that could hold a river back and create light from dark, and move a ship without the use of sails.\n\nXue was an inquisitive boy. When his friends turned their back to go play with junk and his parents went off to work in the fields, Xue would ply travelers for their stories until they finally broke and spilled their tales. Often, they would be mundane. A friend they knew disappeared in the sea to the east, or they knew someone who knew someone who had seen terrible things in the old palaces. The usual old stuff. Occasionally, however, Xue would hear someone talk of the west, and of the empires unknown, and of men with five eyes and four fingers. He would lean in on the edge of his seat to hear those tales, and those nights, he would never get any sleep. His mind wandered endlessly. What lay beyond the hills, to the west?\n\nOne particular day, a traveler came from a direction Xue had never seen a traveler come from. Over the mountains and the wall, from the west. His skin was dark, like he had rubbed charcoal over himself. His clothes were tattered. In a broken Putonghua, Xue gathered that he had been separated from a caravan. He brought the man back to his family's cottage, where his family took him in, feeding him until his cheeks were no longer hollow and mending his strange clothes. As he rested, Xue began asking him a torrent of questions. Where was he from, who did he travel with, and what laid in the west? The man gave simple answers. He came from a great desert, over the mountains and on a road thousands of li long. Xue was fascinated, and the man was happy to oblige him.\n\nEventually, of course, the man had to leave. Xue begged and pleaded with his parents to let him go with him, but they needed their son on the field. When the time came for him to leave, Xue snuck out of the house and followed him down the side of the trail, hiding in the trees. When he was far away enough from the house, he made his presence known. The traveler was not surprised; adolescence had instilled foolish actions in him, too, when he was Xue's age. Nevertheless, he was not one to turn down such a boy, and let him follow along. The father awoke that morning see his son's bed empty. He knew where Xue had gone, and the family mourned. Even if he was not dead, he was as well as such.\n\nThe boy, on the long road over the mountains, witnessed palaces of the gods of an unimaginable size. Each new town and each caravan held stories teeming with life. He could not travel to every place, but at least he could hear of them and their people, the horizons offering a clue of what lay over."

The journey began from the base, and the small fleet of wooden rafts based on traditional designs set sail before the sun rose. It was not hard to make them, although by the time resources got scarcer. Navigation techniques were well-known; they were spread in the Ocean millennia before everything changed, and the great explosions would not change that. Once they headed out into the sea, they simply had to reach an island and rescue as many people to bring to the safe havens they resided in. However, this day was different.\n\nAll the crew was tired as they approached one of the Big Seven. Sweat ran down their bodies, and waves crashed on the small boat. The weather was bad, real bad. It was not a good way to launch the largest operation yet, a rescue mission in one of the Big Seven themselves. Despite that, the sailors continued, and reached the coast by the afternoon. For hours and into the night, they would work endlessly, with their goal to evacuate as many civilians as possible. They boarded the large rafts made for them in panic, and screams could be heard as they fled the smoldering ruins, battling to get on the boats first.\n\nBut the boats were not enough. The island was big, and before the fires the foreigners had made it into a bustling town, one that could not be carried across the waters of the sea. The locals who were not quick enough broke into tears as the boats departed, with the captains making vague promises to return. But they never did.

His free time, which barely existed, consisted mostly of napping and going for walks in the park; walks in which Riku would look solemnly upon the happy people playing with their dogs, lamenting that his basic apartment did not allow any pets.

Suddenly, if the stories are to be believed, he appeared to halt their sack of the defenseless community. They thought they could push right past him. They were mistaken.\n\nFrom there the tales of the man's exploits spread like wildfire. He drove off bandits in the Western Badlands; he braved the perilous journey across the Northern Mountains to deliver medicine to the sick children of a remote village, and some whisper that he even killed the tyrant Emperor of the South with his own hands. Whether any or all of these tales had any merit, the spirit of the people was inflamed. From every corner of the Islands, old oppressive orders began to collapse.

They told her they were only bringing her back for Christmas, but she knew the truth. They were bringing her back home to die.\n\nIt was inevitable and she had long ago stopped fearing it. When you nurse the modern leper it is only a matter of time before the disease takes you too. A lump the size of a dumpling had formed on her neck, making it hard to eat, but fortunately there was no shortage of people to help her chew.\n\nBack when Nagasaki was not a memory and Japan was more than a myth, she remembered the fear. The fear that one day there would be an agent from the Emperor, one smart enough to see through the metaphors and symbolism. On Ikitsuki they worshiped one God, and he did not need a palace on Earth to live in. For years they had hidden it behind a great fortress of mystery and misdirection, but no longer. Now, at the end of the world, they are free.\n\nThey approach the island now, a spire she did not remember appears first, bright and beautiful. It rings out now, the bells are the most beautiful sound she has ever heard. Jun remembers a promise, long ago. One of the end of the world. A promise of heaven on Earth, where God would banish the sinful and bring the holy to heaven.\n\nWell, it was a queer sort of heaven, but it was better than anything Jun had ever dreamt of as a girl. Yes there was pain, but there was such wonders to be found in helping, in serving your fellow children of God.\n\nA bleak paradise it may be, but a paradise it still is."

I'd play with my brothers across the spaces of our cramped village square, and our giggles lit up the drab grey stones of the parade-square tiles. Now it's just Ling and I, playing in the night, so very far away from my home - and so very near to death.\n\nLing laughs, her face a pattern of shades and brightness. I feel the sudden, unaccountable urge to kiss her, and so I do. Her lips are tart, with a hint of bitterness - lipstick, perhaps. Now she pulls me away from her face gently, like she's back at her father's pottery-shop moving vases, and she whispers, her face cast in serious lines. "Are you sure your friends from the Army will mind?" I nod, smiling. It makes very little difference now. The Kwangtung Army, as of the first launch of tactical missiles from bases in Harbin, has ceased to exist as a functioning force. My friends, if they are lucky, have already melted into the struggling transports back to Kyushu. Those who are not...\n\nI do not consider myself one of the unlucky ones. My family, if they are not already dead, will surely join the Spirits soon. I have not seen them in years - the love that seemed most real to me was shrouded in the smiles and the warm gestures of the girl who found me in Shanghai all those years ago. She is a proud woman now, although we never married. I sometimes regret it.\n\nEven so, what we have is beautiful. Fireflies live lives brief and tender as spring-flowers, but still they dance. I hear the dull whistle of something roaring into the sky, towards the forests ahead of us. I whisper the old poem: "My life/Came from dew/And melts like dew./All of Naniwa/Is dream after dream." And I pull Ling close once more, facing the new dawn for her, as the sun touches down in the forests of Liaoning."

Thousands of men and women -- some dressed in fine silk, others with naught but bare chest and leggings -- trained their eyes onto a regal figure sat on a worn throne. A smaller figure, no less dressed, kneeled in front of him with his head bowed.\n\nBehind them, and in front of the host, rested a lumbering behemoth of steel. It stretched the span of a dozenfold horses, separated into sections tethered to one another by large nails. Trophies and writing adorned its well-oiled sides: tattered banners of defeated, curses in their native tongue, the names of fallen warriors and the honored dead, skulls and bones strung together with cords of hemp. Old men in the robes of monks scatter wisps of incense throughout its length, chanting mantras to their ancestors and gods. None dared to interrupt them as they performed their sacred functions.\n\nThese lands were not spared by the flames of the Purification, yet the steeds of steel with which its peoples built their great cities, and the tracks which these traveled, miraculously remain. Capable of carrying a thousand men across a hundred leagues in speeds faster than any horse, they became the prized possessions of great warlords who now roam the dry plains. Owning one such steed was an honor reserved only to the strongest of K'uan-dong, who had acquired them through many wars spread across many years.\n\nThe monks had completed their rituals when the old warlord rose up, beckoning the knelt man to come closer. Words were exchanged in the tongue of nomads. They did not carry through the wind as they once had, but the host did not need words to know what had taken place -- for as the old man lifted his son's hand to the air, every member of the warband roared and shouted and screamed their exultations to the eternal blue sky."

Stray roots remained at the bottom, rough with pebbles and stones of gravel -- a poorly-made ditch, all things considered. He sighed to himself. It will have to do. He glanced at the body beside his feet. The dead eyes of an old man in a faded olive uniform stared back at him.\n\nThe General was there when the bombs dropped, they said, years before Mama brought him to the world. Quick on his feet, he gathered what was left of the army to the mountainsides while China burned to the ground. Many lost hope, but the General was there to raise their spirits back up. The War of Resistance will continue, he liked to say, just as it had continued even after the death of Chairman Mao.\n\nChina's wilderness disagreed, however. The elements beat upon the ranks like a slavemaster's cruel whip, dragging weakened men with them as the days and months pass. Starvation dealt a second blow, for there was nothing to forage in the harsh hinterlands. An army dwindled into a thousand, then a thousand into a hundred. Eventually, only he and a handful of guards remained by the General's side.\n\nHis final moments remained like a clear film reel on the back of Li Chuang's mind. Shaky hands gently shoving a worn, bloody copy of the Little Red Book onto his chest. Bloodshot eyes filled with tears, struggling to hold his gaze. "Protect the revolution, Hong Xiaogui," he whispered, before his figure stilled one last time. So died the last general of the New Fourth Army.\n\nLi Chuang never truly met Mama before. All he remembered of her were vague noises and the blurry face of a young woman -- his first clear memory was the General teaching him how to write Mandarin. So died then, alone but for Li Chuang holding him upright, the father he never had.\n\nBlinking away tears and breathing deep, the little red devil tended to his filial duties. He gently laid his father onto the poor grave, soiling his trousers with the earth he had dug. Claps resounded in the forest, heard by none but its creatures. The last of their paper yuan, now useless, burned and rose above the canopy. As the General left his war on Earth to rest with his ancestors, his son left their cruel abode and never looked back."

He wore a simple roughspun tunic, worn but well-kept. Never a day goes by without him haggling prices down for some trotters. Old Feng knew about his problems back home, especially the bottle of cheap drink he carries with him all the time, so he always gave in.\n\nNext was Little Li, one of the guards manning the city wall. He always enters with the politeness of a respectful young man, with the right amount of money to buy shoulder and belly, his favorites. They talk about the silly yellow uniform he wears with him, probably acquired from some old ruins, but Old Feng never was one for gossip. Little Li was among his favorite customers, and that's the end of that.\n\nLast was Elder Zhang, among the oldest men in town. He wears silk and enters his shop without saying a word, with meek steps and a hunched back. The butcher never really understood him when he does speak -- his tongue was similar, yet at the same time different, like the difference between offal and rind.

They had built grand estates on terraced rice farms and established a strict caste structure. At the top were the Black Yi, the revered nobility of the Southwest. Beneath them were the White Yi, men who were free, yet common. At the bottom of this structure were the slaves. These unfortunate souls were once foreigners, kidnapped and forced to till the soil for generations. Sweat coated their brows and whips broke their backs, all while the Black Yi would sit in their manors, chattering to each other over tea and dim sum.\n\nYet, when pillars of smoke smothered the sky and men melted to ash, those few left alive in the Southwest had no choice but to huddle together in the manors for shelter. The Black Yi had to till what was left of their fields themselves. All surviving hands were needed in the new world. No one needed the whip to work; the fear of natural death was enough to drive them forward. Everyone left was able to eat their simple meals communally in the old manors, and bunked in them too.\n\nFor generation after generation, this was their way of life. Over time, the people slowly began to forget which among them was once a Black Yi or a White Yi or a slave. After even more time passed, they struggled to remember what "Black Yi" or "White Yi" even meant. Everything the survivors had on their farms was shared in common, and human beings were not among the shared property.\n\nOne thing they never forgot, however, was that the Southwest belongs to the Yi. To those who called it home, however, a Yi was anyone who was willing to work. A Yi was anyone who would share the fruits of his labors with his fellows. A Yi was anyone who devoted himself to the freedom and survival of those around him. Finally, a Yi was someone who helped make the Southwest a home for all his brothers, and would protect that home forevermore."

He claimed that he was the descendant of a great ruler of ancient times who once united these lands in a glorious conquest. What he said likely held little weight, and none would have granted him even a moment of their time - at least, if it weren't for the army at his back.\n\nThe conqueror swept through the lands of the far east, taking hold of vast swathes of loosely controlled territory through sheer force of numbers and sudden, lightning-fast strikes. The unprepared kingdoms and settlements of that land could do naught but surrender, or retreat in the face of an unstoppable foe. Yet it was the seemingly unstoppable nature of this invading force that would be its undoing. Despite the unending petty squabbles between the nations of the east, they were faced with an existential crisis. Their choice was plain to see: temporarily end their rivalries, or face certain subjugation.\n\nOver the months, a grand coalition slowly formed in the face of the conqueror, as every move became ever more difficult for him - ever more a risk. He elected to quash the coalition by delivering to them a decisive defeat, and thus set forth to conquer one last time. Amassing a grand army from all of his subject peoples and nations, he marched to meet the still-forming coalition in preemptive combat.\n\nThe battle promised to be legendary; thousands of men readied themselves to face the enemy, as generals huddled in tents, carefully planning their strategies and tactics for the coming struggle. Yet, as the battle came to action, little of that planning would be put to use. The conqueror was swept off his horse by a conveniently placed arrow, perishing upon the field of battle before the first shields had even clashed. As swiftly as his conquests began, they were undone. His armies scattered and fled, and the lands he once conquered celebrated their freedom. Hardly a conqueror's dream."

Behind the Great Forest, he said, was a lake with no fish, no land and no grass. The town's fishermen stayed away because they thought it was cursed, because why wouldn't a lake have tasty fish and tall grasses? But Chen was a curious child, and so she trailed off the cracked path home and went off into the lake beyond the Great Forest.\n\nThey were right, the lake didn't have grass or fish.

There it was!\n\nThe playground was just as big and long as she remembered it. It laid right next to the edge of the lake, where the not-land met the water, and had -- she counted, one, two, three -- big funny looking boxes with fingers.

Its lhakhangs and statues remain standing, and with them and many others centuries of culture from the days of the Three Great Dharma Kings.

Both burn easily in nuclear hellfire, which was what purportedly happened to the fourteenth of this sacred line. No one precisely knew of the circumstances involved, and no one dared to pry. What mattered most was that the Roof of the World had suddenly lost its guide; should this state persist in these uncertain times, the structure as a whole becomes more prone to collapse.\n\nWith the current chaos, assembling the High Lamas on the direction their search shall take is an exercise in futility.

Gao Guanlin was not a philosopher or a historian, but one thing he was certain: The very concept, the very word known as "Jiuzhou" told of an idea greater than any cause, race, tongue, faith, or man.\n\nThe warlord turned to the east from Simian Mountain's peak. On his way alongside Yangzhe River was a "Xiang River United Army", the host of yet another powerful warlord. To the north his scouts report his ally Dong Junfa being assailed by Xie Dongsheng. Gao Guanlin can send part of his army to assist him, but will leave his rear guard vulnerable to incursions by Hou Yong. He sighed. Even after victory, hard decisions remain.\n\nBut the warlord had made peace with himself long ago. He might fall to poison, age, betrayals, or battles... they did not matter. In the end, Jiuzhou will be made whole once more -- either with him at the helm, or with him left forgotten in a shallow grave."

Through backbreaking labor they negotiated with the river spirits. Sometimes they fought them, sometimes they begged them, but always they came to an understanding. Life was hard, but they got by.\n\nUntil a self-titled bandit king came riding in one day. On a black horse he rode, and in his hand was an ancient weapon. The village wizard called it a wand, a metal rod twisted and infested with thunder demons from the mountains of the east. Wherever the king directed it, people died and animals fled from the howl of the thunder-wand.\n\nFor seven seasons the village suffered beneath the bandit king. The people had no time to negotiate with the river spirits, and the floods destroyed their crops. Desperate and starving, some of the people of the village became the slaves of the king. The men beat their neighbours into submission, whilst the women served him and his bandits in unspeakable ways.\n\nUntil one day, a rider on a white horse came to town. He was clad all in steel, black and red like the flames of the sacred oil. On his shield he bore a white dog, howling to a black sun on a red field. By his side was a long, straight sword of antique make and in his eyes their was burning ice.\n\nHe told the village he was a Knight of the Mad Dog, and he was here to liberate the village. The villagers wept with joy and followed the knight the camp of the king. The bandits rushed the knight, but with speed and disdain he cut them down, until only the King remained. Thrice he loosed the thunder wand on the knight, and thrice the knight gave a howl more dreadful than any the wand had ever given. In six steps, he closed the distance and the king was slain. Slave and villager alike cheered and wept, but the knight just turned and left."

Perhaps they knew the mad dog only slew hanjian-demons, or perhaps they knew not what they were at all, but after seven days and seven nights some four hundred villagers followed the army of Dali wheresoever they went.\n\nOn the eight day, the banner of the black sun flew beneath the ramparts of the city of Iron whales, where whale-breakers dissected the beached bodies of tremendous metal whales, long since dead, and fashioned their sacred Steel boned into holy relics. The Grandmaster of the mad dog knights met with the Queen of red Nam, and his Bifo priests read ancient inscriptions of protection from the ministrations of their Theory-shamans.\n\nThere Grandmaster demanded the Queen submit to the power of the mad dog and allow his howl to banish the Hanjian demon from her realm, but lo the Hanjian twisted her heart against him and she laughed at his justice. With divine rage he drew his sword, but her guards used dark trickery to slay him where he stood.\n\nEnraged by this, a champion of the mad dog challenged the Queen to a duel of honor, yet so cowardly was her court that only a humble farmer who had followed them for seven days agreed to fight him.\n\nSurrounded by trees, the farmer and the knight fought, one with steel and skill while the other was clad in sack-cloth with a wooden cane. You may ask, dear listener, who would win? But you, like the champion, did not know the secret power of the farmer, for he was an ally of the forest, and at his words it sprang to life. Arrows and darts slew the champion, from shadows and dryads came the ambush.

So bound, the demon was willing to strike a bargain it would not normally strike. He came down to the ruins of Guangdong, where the scavengers picked at the concrete monoliths for the wisdom of the ancients, not in thought but in substance.

Sultans and princes raised banners old and tattered in the service of a vanished dream - but the precise contours of that dream had been lost in the harsh dawn of the Burning. One story, as intense and bitter as a bad dream, was preserved. Songstresses and silk-weavers whispered and retold, whispered and retold, whispered - and retold. And so the dream came to life, becoming a popular myth-legend spread in the same folk-theatre circles as the Mahabharata and the Red Plays.\n\nThe story, in its thousand variations, went something like this: Long, long before the present time, in the days when men lifted silver wings and mated with the stars, the Great and Terrible Queen Durga arose, an agent of chaos in a land rent with strife - her seductive promises beguiled the Court into submission, and the ones her words could not reach, her Dark Agents cowed into silence. It was said that her reign brought the entirety of Hind to its knees, stifling the tongues and words of men with arcane orders, killing the Sikhs and Muslims in their temples, seducing the farmers into working for her designs. Some stories recorded that she had tamed the Power of the Sun herself, bringing horror-fire upon the Earth as a gift to her enemies.\n\nMost saw it as a cautionary tale, but as is customary with these stories, some took it as a prophecy. Eventually a warlord arose in the lands far to the West, where the Great Indus touched the sea. His conquests stretched from the Indus to the wetlands of Bengal, and in his consuming arrogance he dared to take upon himself the True Name of Durga, the name that none dared speak. It was a step too far, even for the most loyal of his retinue. The Emperor Indira Gandhi, Second Of His Name, was killed in his sleep in the tenth year of His Reign by Sikh bodyguards angered by His insolence. His empire ripped apart like an old satin sheet - and the tale of Goddess Durga took on one final, terrible twist."

But there was one place it took a little longer to reach than most. The Free-Indian border had been one of the most militarized in the world: the dance of the two countries' guards at a Bengali checkpoint, bristling with weapons and ceremonial swords, had become a regional tourist attraction. In the chaos that swept Jai Hind as the cities torched, the forces leapt upon each other, a frenzy of violence echoing through the poisoned air.\n\nPosterity has forgotten the name of the Free general who, in his wisdom, gave the order to cease fighting and focus the arms and effort of the men still alive to keep the villages safe from raiders and famine. It was a sentiment many on the other side of the Bengali border agreed with. And so the two set their arms aside and began the quiet, painful task of healing the world.\n\nSlowly order came like sense to a drunken head, in fits and starts and aches and pains. Village by village submitted to the rule of the Guards, as they were now known, for security and for the skills the Guards' considerable civilian retinues offered. Brickworks, navigation, the lost arts of medicine. Flowers grew in barracks and rifle ranges converted to terraced fields - rusting hangars and planes and bombs were disassembled for their parts.\n\nEventually the Guards themselves forgot their origin. But for reasons unknown even to them, for centuries after its purpose had been forgotten, two members of the elite Guards would march to each other at the bustling capital city of Checkpoint, wave their swords at each other, and salute a tattered flag upon which could be seen, in faint imprints, the stitched-together pattern of two vanished nations. The composite banner would wave in the afternoon sun, and on occasion the onlookers would feel a strange sadness for something they had never known as they watched it, like watching the colors of the evening fade to dusk-grey."

Not so for the buildings - they are swept away in the blast, momentary pyres to a dying world.\n\nIn the sprawling refugee camps that sprout outside the city the sickness reaches with invisible tendrils, felling men and women and children in heaps like a new plague. The tractors run out of gas to dig the corpse-trenches - by the second week trench-building has stopped altogether. From this point onwards death will be at home, or in massive unsanitary tents, in agonizing pain and shouts heard only to the rest of the dying.\n\nThe wind comes for the survivors. The limited biological weapons stockpiles of the Old World are unbound by the commands of dying generals, and so in the rivers of men flowing to ruralities death comes again by another poison breeze.

This is one of those stories.\n\nIn the hours before the suns touch Indian soil many flee - but the actors and directors of the Indian film industry in Bombay are endowed with the means to flee a little more effectively than most. Raj Kapoor (with American forewarning from loyal fans in D.C.) rushes friends and coworkers into armed limousines headed straight for the mountains. O. P. Nayyar, Suchitra Sen and many other actors seek refuge with armed film-enthusiasts cutting a path through to the refuge of the rural villages. K.A.

(Mehboob Khan refuses to be disturbed, and will be one of a few directors still in the city at the time of the bombs.)\n\nAs the missiles blaze through Bombay the convoys speed through the highways of India, all heading to different locations. But the arm of the state, though shriveling in fire, remains strong: convoys are stopped by barricade guards and set upon by suspicious policemen. Panicking, Nayyar's clique prepares to cut their way out - and are cut down by trigger-happy Army men. Conversely, the Abbas convoy barely makes it to the outskirts of the city before they are torn limb from limb by the hungry poor. Kapoor's limousines, well-stocked with fake visas and real guns, make it the furthest - they are about 350 miles from the city when their convoys at last break down.

Sometimes, mercifully enough, they were simply killed for their pains.\n\nA branch of the Indian Film Society, huddled in expeditious refuge in a village in Gujarat, was caught more or less by surprise. With their charity film-screening events permanently on hold, the group was stranded far from the cities (which were, in any case, torched-out shells) and lacking in supplies. In a desperate attempt to ingratiate themselves with the restive locals, they offered something invaluable: access to their vast collection of Bollywood films, all on handy tapes stored in their belongings. The village accepted, and as the famines and the Black Winter hit the small village the watching of film became an accepted outlet for stress-release and entertainment.\n\nSlowly the tapes failed, one by one, and as generations grew and died the equipment itself became lost to time despite the efforts of the film crew's descendants to maintain the machines. Even so, the ritual of watching a blank screen with the projectors reverentially set up and the spools of lovingly preserved tape had become almost religious. In time, it became an actual religion, and as the descendants of the villagers grew to become a prosperous trading outpost, the prince of the fiefdom enforced the new faith upon the inhabitants of the city - meditating upon a blank screen and sculptures of boxy film-projectors became the subject of intense piety, sacred scriptures and many, many wars."

Those who knelt before him lived. Those that did not were thrown into moats by the hundreds. The Raja extracted a cruel price from the lands he ruled every year, calling every village to send him a man or woman for his enjoyment: if they did not entertain him (which they invariably ceased to do after a couple of weeks, no matter what they offered in flesh or gold) he would execute them. For years this went on, murder after murder, as lambs sent to a slaughterhouse.\n\nA poor village that had recently fallen under the sword of the Raja sent only one man, an aged man nearly incapable of walking. The Raja laughed uproariously at the sight, preparing to execute him and everyone else in the village for their audacity. But the Old Man, knowing the Raja's heart, asked the Raja for a week alone in his quarters, where he would teach him the Sacred Teachings of the Prophet Rao. For a week the two meditated together, seeking wisdom in the Liberation of the People from The Eternal City - the Old Man recited the Scripture of Rao chapter and verse from his tattered village education.\n\nAt the end of the week the Raja walked out in the same body, but with his heart forever changed. He tore his rags before the Court, called a meeting of the lords of the land, and there he forsook his crown. As the empire collapsed behind him, the Raja, now a commoner, took up the robes of saffron and red - he undertook a pilgrimage to the village from whence the Old Man had come, and there he spent the rest of his life preaching the Teachings of Rao, and the Liberation of the People, to the commoners he once abused."

Something would have to give.\n\nAjay's eye was drawn to the local map, for in the past his Household had discovered a few precious quarries and oldtech deposits by scrutinizing the surrounding region. When the Great Fires came they destroyed much, but they had not scorched all the offenders of the Gods off the earth. Perhaps some of them remained to be dug up and sold, or to be used. At least that was the logic the Great-Father of the Clan had used when he began the process of restoring the city, so many decades ago.\n\nAjay's gaze caught something: a dot, obscured by mold and dust, with the markings DELHI on it. A city of the Old Ones, so close to Nu-Delhi, named after the same city he was trying to restore: this could only be the hand of God himself! Leaping to his feet, he called for his master-scavengers to assemble, already preparing the scavenging crews. Yes, for Nu-Delhi to rise, this pretender Delhi would be disassembled, brick by brick, until his family's creation stood complete and beautiful in the wrappings and stones of its sister. Had Ajay been a humorous man, he would have smiled."

In the time since the Desolation, many new creatures had made a place for themselves along the great Ganges, though many puzzled over their origin. For the most ancient of texts that survived the fires spoke only of a few of these beings, such as the elephants, the tigers and the peafowl. Of the great lyon and the fearsome heppo and the elegant zeehorse and all manner of other strange and wondrous creatures, the texts maintained a brooding silence.\n\nThe only explanation lay in the legends. It is said that the gods revealed themselves to their most faithful of believers, and tasked them with the role of the Keepers. They were commanded to build a great menagerie of all the beasts of the earth, even those from beyond their lands. A special place was crafted for each animal, styled after their homes so that their hearts would not grow longing to return. For a time, men of the old nations would come to see their realm and gaze in awe at all the bounty of the earth. And then - for reasons unknown - the world was plunged into a thousand years of darkness.\n\nAnd yet the Keepers did not stray from their sacred task. Through the struggle and the pain, they protected their charges from the forces of the shadow, and from greedy mortals looking for a feast. Even through the worst times the animals grew yet more numerous, and when the light of rebirth finally shone back upon the earth, the Keepers released their flock back into a world that was once more ready for them.\n\nIt is said that the gods still smile upon those who protect the beasts of the world in times of hardship. For every creature, great and small, is as worthy of kindness and respect as the mightiest king."

Their destination, pristine and unmarred, awaits them at the top.\n\nThe Seven Suns had come and gone, purging the mortal plane of both good and evil. Rivers boiled to ash, the works of man became works in ruins, plains of grass burned into ash and soot. The souls of billions departed to their next lives as their bodies burned or fell to wound, hunger, or pestilence. Truly, the world had experienced a great harrowing, from which it might never truly recover.\n\nYet as the fates would have it, the mountains of Himalaya and Bod suffered only the proverbial touch of sunburn. A thousand thousand suns may have engulfed the sky in warm orange glow, but nowhere near the world's highest peaks. Nowhere near their temples, embedded onto their cliffs and slopes as if they were natural extensions. In the end, all that remained of the Buddha's teachings made manifest are those scattered all over the Rooftop and its Plateau.\n\nFinally, their guide arrived and ambled to them, dressed in the warm wools of the Sherpa. With a welcoming smile but nary a word he beckoned them to follow, and so they did in a single, orderly line."

He had resolved to take action, and thus would the tales record how the future ruler of all the world he had knowledge of began his mission.\n\nHe began by gathering the poor, the disaffected, and the outcasts. He gave them respect, and they gave him their undying loyalty in exchange. He gave them a purpose in life, and they returned the favor by fulfilling his. As if by magic, cities and villages fell under his leadership overnight. The people gravitated toward his magnetic charms and almost hypnotic powers of oration. He even took the title of the Gandhi, connecting himself to a legendary figure said to have lived in the time before the Deluge. As the people of every city-state and nation embraced him in turn, he proclaimed himself the Chakravarti.\n\nWith minimal conflict, this former monk had united one of the great peoples of the earth for the first time in centuries. Under his gentle hand, the people no longer had to fear the whims of petty tyrants or have to worry about going hungry, for he planned out his heavenly empire on earth with great care.\n\nWhen he finally passed, he was venerated as a god and the Temple of the Chakravarti remained a dominant influence in the east long after there were none who still remembered the beauty of his words or the appeal of his personality.

It was said that the Theater-Company had been created in the years before the Burning Time, and as the awestruck boy looked on it seemed to him that the impossibly bright robes of red and purple were surely divine in origin. The foreigners spoke a strange tongue to each other - some of the elders whispered that it sounded like the dialects their grandfathers from the South had used - but they were passably conversant in the local tongue. A meeting was arranged with the village head, who granted them permission to perform in the meeting square.\n\nThe play began with a clash of swords: men with their faces painted ghoulishly white pranced around the stage, fighting and hooting at each other in an alien speech. Another group of men, wearing the traditional dresses of actors, came on stage, and were waylaid by the white-faced men - the plates of grain they were carrying spilled across the theatre, drawing gasps from the audience. A young boy about Abhijit's age ran across the theatre stage, shouting for his family: just off his field of vision the white-faced men threw his parents off the stage. Crying men and women marched in chains, with the white men riding them. Here the latter acquired a new name. Englishmen. The makers of Famine and the harbingers of Death. Then, roars and thunder to the East: a great ragged banner, white with a red sun in the centre, rose and felled the Englishmen, to the cheers of all in the audience.\n\nThe men and women in traditional dress came together in the middle of the stage, waving a new flag: this one with yellow and green stripes, with a red-accented tiger in the middle. They sang a song of a land called Azad Hind, and of the freedom of the people of Great India. One final banner was hoisted above the audience, red with white symbols - and the Indian People's Theatre Association, Bengal Branch, saluted the Communist Party of India as a blazing red dawn rent the sky."

It suited our lifestyle well enough though, for most of what we heard about the outside and its worldly desires did not enthuse us. My life had a clear structure, consisting of meditation, study, and chores. My days were consumed by the routine, although I believe that it taught me something new every day, about the monastic life, so that I could teach the wisdom of Buddha, just as he had to his disciples. Yet I only understood it fully on the day the world was set on fire.\n\nI remember that day perfectly, for it was so ordinary and then suddenly so horrifyingly different. From the mountain perch of the monastery, I watched as the cities in the distance exploded and burned. I saw how the villagers rushed up the mountain to seek shelter, lest death came for them in their homes too. I saw all of this, and I ran from it. I was so terrified that I lost all sense of direction. When I finally stopped, I looked up to find that I had wandered into a cavern. Right in front of me, was a tiny statue of Buddha, flanked by two lit braziers.\n\nHad the monastery been destroyed behind me, leaving with me as the last human left? So overwhelming was my fear and despair that I must have fainted. Surely, I had died and was waiting to be reborn. But instead, I watched the rise and fall of empires, through the eyes of mighty kings and wretched labourers. I lived as four good men and as four evil men. I ended the world and then I tried to save it. In the myriad worlds I wandered in, I felt the pain of life cut short, and I felt the joy of death postponed. Last of all, I saw Buddha walk the cracked and ruined Earth, with a lotus sprouting with each barefoot step he took, until the Earth was restored to verdant splendor. He turned his head to smile at me, before I awoke on the cavern floor.\n\nOne of the other monks found me not long after and guided me back to the monastery, quite untouched by the fires. The devastation beyond still saddened me, but I could already see the new world starting to grow, in the hearts of all mankind."

This vast expanse was not the homeland of Arjun, the emperor's family having come from far to the east, from whence the powerful warrior Arjun led his army in its westward conquest all the way to the unending sand in the farthest west. This whole land Arjun made into his own, and left the world to marvel upon its size and upon the hundreds of thousands of men living within it.\n\nArjun conquered this expanse at the tip of his talwar, and this blade that he wielded became the symbol of his office as emperor. When Arjun waged his last campaign against the chariot people and met his first and last defeat, he did not bring the talwar along with him, the blade being kept in his palace, built at the confluence of two small rivers with water that flows green. Arjun's death at the hands of the chariot people was blamed on his conquest proceeding without his holy sword, and so all those lords who had bowed to him and now sought to take over his kingdom converged on his palace. There the greatest of all battles was fought between their armies, ending more lives than all of Arjun's conquests ever had. The twin green rivers of the palace grounds were masked by the red of the blood that was shed, and when the last living vassal of Arjun, the victor of the battle, went to the rivers to wash off the blood from the blade, the waters only stained the talwar red for all time.\n\nThe last lord wielded the talwar in public, to show to the people of Arjun's kingdom that he was the conqueror's heir, that the sword rested with him. But the people remembered their conqueror's sword well, and his talwar was not a red one. Arjun had been merciful in his conquests, and had not taken his weapon to the people of the farms and sullied either his blade's colour or his soul's sanctity with the taking of innocent life. And so the people did not know of their emperor's sword to ever be red, and they knew the last lord was a cutthroat and a liar. The last lord had killed all their masters, and Arjun was gone, so the people returned to their oldest ways, living in peace and simplicity, and remembering for all time that any man whose sword is red is not to be followed."

Those few alive who still reside on the Ganga's shores respect her as they always should have, assigning her their thanks for seeing to their survival of the great fires that scorched the land in that time long ago--and the trials that followed them.

Their stories were always about struggling against the malice of nature and humanity, and after the apocalypse this would only continue.\n\nsAfter the detonations another tribe managed to trudge into the desert, arriving from the south. They hoped to find a little piece of oasis for themselves, if it existed for them to find. The desert, however, showed little mercy toward these newcomers, for she knew that their ways, the ways of roaring machinery and fireballs, were responsible for what happened to the world. In the end, the last survivor of this tribe, sitting alone in the boundless void, laid his head to rest and lost himself in his last nostalgic dream of a dead home.\n\nsA drum of hooves woke him up as he was drifting away. When he opened his dazed eyes, a group of local herdsmen had gathered around him and were whispering in a language that he had never bothered to understand. Then he found that some were pointing at the old swastika-shaped medal on his chest, and their expression quickly changed into disgust. They would want revenge, he thought, for their burning homes, shattered families and all the other sorrows they associated with that symbol.\n\nEventually, the herdsmen fell silent. The eldest one walked up to him and stared at his desperate face. After a moment of dead silence, the old herdsman put his right hand on his old uniform and tore the medal off. Then, a young child approached him, with a water pitcher in his hands.\n\nsThe pilot and the herdsmen never spoke a word to each other that day, but for the rest of his life, the old pilot always claimed that he had heard the most beautiful hymn of the desert in that moment."

Perhaps not as lethal, but just as wicked. They called it the Devil's Breath. And while the other weapons of old became legend, the Devil's Breath remained very real, lying deep beneath the sulfurous earth, waiting for a new master.\n\nIn the lands of Zanzibar, over a dozen tribes fought a bloody, constant battle for control of the Swahili Coast. Their war had lasted for generations, with no side being able to gain the upper hand over the other. The warriors of each tribe fought with many weapons; spears, blades, even a few of the firearms from before the End. Though they fought ferociously, none had the power to break the deadlock.\n\nThen one day, the Warlord Kiira found it, buried in an ancient fortress of the Old World. The Breath of the great Demon H'Tag. His forces unleashed the Devil's Breath upon his foes, hurling their canisters from crude catapults. The mighty forces of his enemies sputtered and died in agony as the fumes of Hell swept battlefield after battlefield. Entire villages vanished beneath a noxious blanket, and by the end of his campaign Kiira sat upon the throne of an empty kingdom; a throne drenched in blood.\n\nHe would sit for barely a year. One of his commanders, horrified by Kiira's actions, did conspire to destroy him. Barring the doors to the palace along with his co-conspirators, he released the last of the Devil's Breath within.

Its toxic waters spread like tendrils through the rivers of Africa, bringing decay to the soil and illness to the people. The tribes of the Basin departed, hoping to find places untouched by hellfire and rot where they could settle down, safe from the terrors of the ruined world. One tribe, its name long forgotten to the ages, traveled north-east. It was said that their ancestors had come from a land that straddled a great river, which stretched up to the very north of the continent. And so, seeing no other option the tribe set upon a journey sure to be long and arduous.\n\nPredatory animals were seldom a problem, as fire kept them away from tribe's camp. Other tribes did not cause trouble, for in those times all humans suffered the apocalypse's fire and through it a kinship was forged, the true killer was starvation. Food was scarce, no matter how far the tribe traveled from the tendrils of the poisoned basin. Water was precious, more so when it had to be boiled to cleanse the worst of its impurity. For months they traversed the rainforests and plains, their numbers dwindling all the while, but just as hopelessness might have set in a peculiar sign restored their courage. A cold, yet welcoming breeze guided them eastwards towards sloping, terrain. The breeze grewer stronger each day, and the terrain more mountainous, until finally opening up to reveal a great, green valley below. For the first time in too long, the tribe ate well. They slept beneath the towering mountains and marveled at the snow-capped peaks lit so brilliantly by the moonlight, the first snow they had ever seen in their lives. It is said that their descendants live in the valley to this day, and that the mountains beneath the moon are just as beautiful as when their ancestors first saw them."

How could the old wheeled machine he kept on his farm possibly fly after all? Yes, it had wings but they could not even flap!\n\nOne day she asked the old farmer as he headed home from the camel races, to which he merely grinned that it was a secret. Fatima thought that he was just lying because he didn't know the answer, to which he only smiled more.\n\nAs she grew older like all children did she forgot about the stories Jabal had whispered around those campfires at night, and focussed more on friends, life, and eventually even a family with the young boy who had once snuck into the stables to pet the camels. Yet life is not a kind mistress, and one day the life of Fatima was changed forever when she looked upon the skies. Hanging like angels, and making a noise like thunder were six flying machines. Moving faster even than the falcons that Fatima raised for the mayor to hunt with. But these machines were not angelic in purpose, and from their bellies they dropped fire and death. The street where Fatima had walked after her wedding day was incinerated, the mayor and his palace were obliterated, and even the camel racing tack was scorched by great plumes of fire and metal.\n\nAt first Fatima could do nothing but stare in horror, until a small buzzing noise emerged from over the horizon. Faltering a smoking, juddering in the air, was Old Jabal and his flying machine. With fire of his own he struck down four of his foes and sent the other two fleeing to the west, yet during the battle he was struck, and when the village reached the place where his machine had come down, they found it intact, Jabal smiling, unmoving in his seat."

He lived in an old tower in the village outskirts, atop the ruins of a structure from before the End Times.\n\nHe was a weird, silly sort, doing and saying all sorts of things men with sense tend not to do and say. Villagers learned to stay away when he falls to his knees and sing in a foreign tongue at some points in the day. But no one had ever seen Imam angry, or without a smile on his face, so the villagers let him stay.\n\nOne day, as he rested on a cedar tree reading a heavy book with beautiful squiggles, a curious child went up to him and asked, "Imam, why do you live in a sorry old ruin?"\n\nTo the child, Imam replied with a gentle old voice: "Allah protects the faithful, son." Satisfied, but not quite so -- Allah? What's that? -- the child trotted back home.\n\nYears passed and the child became a young man. Imam's salt-and-pepper beard had grown more salt than pepper by now, and he walked with a limp as old men do. As Imam tossed what little coins he had to a beggar, the young man went up to him and asked, "Imam, why do you spend your coin on others, but not on yourself?"\n\nImam gave him another smile, and said in a raspier voice: "Allah protects the faithful, lad." The young man remained confused: again with the Allah. Who is Allah? But Mama called for him suddenly, and Imam urged the young man to go.\n\nMore years passed, and the young man became a grown man. Imam no longer left the tower, so weak had he become. Still, he refused to take the medicine the villagers offered. The grown man visited Imam on his sickbed one day and asked, "Imam, why do you not seek help?"\n\nTo that, Imam willed the last droplets of his strength and said meekly, "My time has come, my boy. Allah shall lead me to Heaven. May He protect you as He did I."\n\nAnd so Imam pass away. All of Bar'shib visited his grave that night, paying their respects for kind, crazy old Imam.

Still, it was inevitable that they would be forced to deal with the consequences of such an extraordinary event sooner or later, as they well knew even if none vocalized the thought. They predicted this correctly, although none of them could have possibly imagined their point of contact with the after effects of the destruction of civilization would play out the way it did.\n\nIt was perhaps a week or more after the band first encountered the refugee who relayed the grim news that they came across the boy. His parents had evidently taken him in an ill-conceived attempt to flee the danger by heading into the relatively safe desert. They had not managed to make it very far at all though, and the parents in question lay dead around the small child, as if they intended to shield him in their final act.\n\nFor a group like the band that lived in the harsh environment of the desert by remaining as efficient as possible with all advisable resources, the idea of taking on a non-productive, attention requiring new member was downright dangerous, and yet, looking at the child, the head of the band felt moved to his core. In this time of great suffering for all mankind, it did not matter in the least that the child was not their own, it made no difference that upon his head sat a yarmulke, or that the band was all Muslim.

So did they learn of the war that had begun not an hour ago... and the terrible devices that will soon end it.\n\nKnocks on the door, then the creak of its opening, interrupted his musings. The Brother turned back and saw Brother Iskarios, then Brothers Emil and Ioannes, shuffle towards him. Eventually the whole monastery gathered in the small hall: sixteen, including himself.

The cultivation of grains for bread production kept the fragile web of arable land prosperous, and eventually the Nile became the centre of a bustling trade network just as it had been in ages past.\n\nAs a result, ramshackle ships would regularly try to sail for the fertile Delta. Many, unfamiliar with the complex navigation required to reach the land would run aground in the desert. A solution needed to be built. At the most major town, built in the ancient ruins of a city bearing the name of a great conqueror (although no one could agree if he had once borne the name of Duce or Caesar) a plan was conceived to build a great lighthouse that would guide ships into the harbor.\n\nThe lighthouse was to be a massive structure, over 300 feet tall and carved of pink granite with an exterior of shimmering limestone.

He knew that it sat opposite a land called Egypt, on the edge of a vast desert. They had sailed across the Jagged Sea from the old monastery, resolving to rebuild the Kingdom of God rather than continue to huddle in isolation. One ruined port after another was bypassed - sometimes due to shots across the bow of their ship from coastal guns - until they finally made landfall far to the south of their original destination. The natives were friendly, and the priests among them knew of Christ and His sacred language, as spoken by the knights.\n\nThe knights had gathered themselves and struck out in the direction of the rising sun. They could ill-afford to travel at night, for that was when raiders struck out from hidden places. Many of the weak and elderly had been lost to the merciless sun, but after a month of trekking through the hills and valleys, the knights had finally arrived at a great old city sat on top of a hill. Around it lay sun-blasted ruins of ages past, and the walls that ringed it bristled with men bearing rifles. As the group approached, the drone of a horn being blown reverberated through the clear evening air. The great doors at the top of the road slowly opened with a weary groan.\n\nAthanasius' heart leaped when he drew close enough to see who stood before him in the fading light. Two men - one in white, with a turban; one in black, wearing a long beard and skull-cap. In unison, the three opened their hands in welcome as Athanasius held his own holy symbol aloft: a golden cross, untarnished and gleaming in the light of the torches on either side of the gate.

Maybe God wanted me to live through it - see everything I ever loved go up in smoke. Jesus, what am I still living for? Italy's gone - bombed to ashes along with the rest of the empire, then washed away when the Gibraltar dam collapsed. I think? Someone there could have survived... up in the Alps or the Apennines, maybe. But Italy itself? The nation, the cities... God, even Rome. Destroyed first by fire, then by flood. Everything the Duce built, wiped out in hours. That day, my world shrank to me, my BM-59, my canteen and the observation tower I got posted to. It's not gotten a whole lot bigger since.\n\nStill, at least someone besides me remembered the occasion. That shepherd, Ibrahim, the one from a few weeks ago - he found his way back to me somehow. I suppose the oasis with a tower next to it kind of sticks out in the middle of the desert, but I can't tell one dune from another out there myself. I've certainly never tried straying from the old road into Syria. Anyway, he brought me a field ration. Can you fucking believe that? An honest-to-god pre-nuke fucking field ration, dug up from some half-buried supply station out near Iraq, apparently. The meat was no good - no hiss when I went to open it - but that chocolate was as good as ever, even covered in bloom. The condensed milk was still sealed, too! Preserved chocolate with condensed milk topping: not exactly a birthday cake, but hell if I care. It's been years since I tasted anything that good.\n\nIbrahim said that his tribe found that station, that there's still plenty of stuff there to use. Wants me to go check it out, help them shift it somewhere safe. It might be a one-way trip - think the bike is on its last legs. Maybe it's time, though.

Now all his tribe - the Hisrelites - could do was wander in the desert.\n\nThe oldest members of his tribe told him stories about the World Before when he was a child. This land had a different name, long ago. The people called it the Levynt. It was said that they had great machines, melted from iron and rock, that could carry you anywhere you wished.

The sages and shamans were in accordance that the poison spirits who once blighted the land had passed on, fleeing before the Red Horde's advance. In their wake lay a trove of treasures bestowed by Great Tengri, a blessing for his chosen son: guns, mechanical steeds, and enough food to feed the entire Red Horde for a decade! Yet, let it be known that Kyzyl Khan was no petty warlord who acted in pursuit of wealth - he shared the fruits of Heaven with the people of the riverlands, that they might recognise the just and pious nature of his rule.\n\nLet it be known that it was here, at the crossroads of the world and among the ashes of empires, that the Red Horde found its home.

And that was when the most elderly person in the town came to the rescue. The 80-year old was the grand-daughter of a local warlord, who himself was member of a generation of scientists. When she was a child, she would hear stories about such mysterious devices and their function.\n\nShe met the past-seekers, and the three got to work. Eventually, they cracked the secret: it was on the inside. Of course, opening the belly of such an object seemed difficult, but anything was possible if one was cunning and used the proper knife. Unfortunately, opening the Box up only made things more difficult. An endless bundle of strings, small rectangles and metal parts appeared before their eyes.\n\nIn the end, the riddle of the Box was never solved. However, the children of those who spent years on trying to solve them inherited their knowledge, and their children did as well. And so, generation after generation, just a tiny bit more was learnt about the past the world could never see. Maybe one day, the whole truth would be learnt."

 RAD.7.t:0 "Back in Time" # Hooked up
 RAD.7.desc:0 "The time that had passed since the Event seemed like an eternity. Perhaps that was because there was no one to remember what came before it. Even the oldest of the town's inhabitants had passed away peacefully, and there was no one to relay the experiences from before the Event. And so, it was slowly forgotten. But one small town had the luck of re-discovering it.\n\nIn the area around the central square, a box was discovered in the ground. While some did not pay much attention, those who did soon saw how precious it was. Once it had been opened, it was a window into the life before the Event. Most had no idea of how that was, but all the information they could have asked for was in there: the way of life, culture, technology, even what some guessed were texts and images regarding politics and foreign affairs, but that they could not comprehend. A handful of objects complimented the rest of the content. The box was opened publicly in an event at the local school, and all the residents were happy to attend. The next weeks would be dominated by the "History Craze", as all everyone ever cared about was the past they had discovered. And, as time passed, that knowledge would be relayed and forgotten, like dust in the wind. But the town would make sure to leave its own mark in history. A few days after the discovery of the box, the mayor celebrated the creation of the town's own "Box for the Future", to be buried and not opened until much later in the future. And in the same spot where the original box had been discovered, a new one took its place, as a guide of history for generations to come."

 RAD.8.t:0 "R4O - Online" # Hooked up
 RAD.8.desc:0 "The detonation of thousands of nuclear weapons burned the surface of Earth to a thin layer of ash and devastated the atmosphere with radioactive particles that made the air itself toxic. Above all of that, though, beyond the world that man created and then destroyed, artifacts of humanity still survived, intact. At least one was still functioning.\n\nR4O was the fourth and final in a series of Earth observation satellites, the "Reconnaissance & Observation" line, launched by the United States for dual military and scientific purposes in the 1960's. The satellites proved entirely worthless in doing anything but alerting the White House that certain destruction was imminent once the missiles started shooting, but it would be their observation capacities that would prove more useful to mankind, long after the concept of military utility became moot.\n\nThree of the four, along with most artificial satellites around Earth, would cease functioning after the apocalypse occurred, and eventually come crashing down to the surface in a blaze of fire. R4O's course was expertly placed, however, and most importantly of all, the remote station back on the surface that fed her instructions was both automated and escaped the blasts unscathed. When billions of men and women died on that fateful day, R4O kept right on watching them. It watched thousands of lights that once illuminated the blue marble at night die all at once, the millions of people who once relied on them dead and gone. But it also saw something more interesting. Something more inspiring. Something that gives hope that humanity might still barely cling to life in a few far corners of her cradle.\n\nIt saw a few lights stay on."

 RAD.9.desc:0 "It came upon the world slowly, inch by inch, as if it was afraid to see with its own the terrible devastation. Gradually it shifted, casting a sweeping gaze upon the aftermath of the final exchange. It saw the craters, fires blazing out of control, monumental buildings reduced to rubble. It saw all there was to see as it ventured forth upon a day like no other in history. It saw all there was to see on a day in which it behaved as it had on every in history.\n\nIt saw the sad sight of Paris, the beautiful wreckage of Rome, the bustling ruins of Delhi, the stately debris of London. It saw the greatest and worst of man's works melded tighter into one terrible, beautiful cacophony of sights and sounds and smells. It looked upon the despair and sorrow and horror of a world turned completely upside down.\n\nBut within its all illuminating, all seeing vision, it also saw the triumph and perseverance of humanity. It saw the survival, the heroic sacrifices, and the will to live no matter the challenge. It saw the plants as they looked up in response to its call, it heard the singing of birds and it saw the animals who emerged from their dens as if, with its coming, the fear of all consuming, irreversible finality had left with the receding night.\n\nAs the scattered remnants of the human race saw its arrival, they were filled with a new courage and reassurance, for even after all that had happened, the dawn had still come to banish the black night."

 RAD.14.desc:0 "The first year after the end of all things was the hardest. Mass starvation, disease, radiation - the death of hope. As mankind's light flickered and waned most believed that their demise would be forgotten, as would humanity as a whole. Every accomplishment, every beautiful artwork, every squalling child brought from the womb into their mother's tired arms, all had been a pointless waste. A cosmological oddity soon lost to the ravages of time.\n\nIt started in different ways, in different places, and some took longer than others. But the first commemorations of the old world began a year to the day after the bombs fell - give or take a few sunrises. In Germany, the shattered remnants of battalions would hold mock gun salutes for their fallen brothers, only conserving their ammunition to face the horrors of the end. In America, priests and their flocks found whatever safe places they could to plant hundreds of crosses, to honor the fallen patriots. In Japan, shrines were constructed from scrap metal and rubble and whatever other detritus could be scavenged, to bring peace to restless spirits.\n\nIt was ad hoc, at first, and the people only gave it their effort if they could afford to take time away from survival. But as the years went on, each culture would do their best to keep the memory alive in their own special way. In Britain, survivors would lay out poppies and wreaths of whatever other flowers could be found in memory of the ghosts of Albion. In Russia, men would meet on the day to drink to the memory of the lost sons of the motherland. From the Americas to Oceania, from the depths of Africa to the far reaches of Asia, the dead would be honored.\n\nEven as the last vestiges of the Old World became myth and the memory of what exactly was being commemorated was forgotten, cultures continued to mourn what was lost. The Empire State would devote parades and poems to the ancestors lost to the ancient flame. The Muhlar tribe would hold a great hunt every year on what they believed to be the day of the end. In Zion prayers would be held within the dome of the Third Temple to give blessings to the ancient dead and thanks for their own survival.\n\nOne day, a man would set foot on the moon, and find an ancient, bleached flag. He would look to the Earth, and remember those who had set foot here long before, and say a quiet poem in their memory."

Men made slow strides from their metal vessel and observed a landscape thought unseen by man from anything besides a telescope. Proudly, they jumped forward, flag in hand, broadcasting their words for all to hear.\n\nBut what they saw in the distance surprised them.\n\nThe mission changed, confusion mounted. The explorers ventured far, far, out of where they had originally planned. And there they found another flag, bleached long white by untold centuries on the surface. In that moment, millions of scientists, and historians, and archeologists sat mouths agape, as what was once a fairy tale passed down from time immemorial sat as if in defiance of these new interlopers.\n\nCarefully they removed the flag, and replaced it with their own. The final untouched monument to a lost humanity, brought home to be studied and observed. Perhaps until the next flag would be planted on the surface of the moon."
