 RAD_RUS.1.desc:0 "언제나 그랬듯이 시베리아의 춥고 추운 날이었습니다. 눈이 지면을 덮으며 그 아래의 태양을 본 적도 없고, 앞으로도 보지 못할 흙을 감추었습니다. 아르티움이 장화를 신고 모피를 입은 채 한 손에는 새 보따리를, 다른 손에는 소총을 들고 걸어가면서 위의 구름을 보았습니다. 구름이 평상시보다 더 어두우며 폭풍이 올 것처럼 보였습니다.\n\n털과 가죽에 쌓인 눈을 털고서는 그의 금방이라도 쓰러질 것 같은 오두막의 문을 열고 들어가 물건들을 근처의 탁장 위에 조심스럽게 올려놓았습니다.\n\nAfter a quiet moment of contemplation as he remarked over his quiet abode and lit his lamp, he scratched his dog, Sasha, behind the ear and turned on the radio as he did everyday, and frowned as he got nothing besides static.\n\nArtyom quickly started surfing through the few stations he reached, and found nothing but static, static, and more static. After some time, he shrugged, he had expected the old tilting radio tower near the equally dilapidated village to collapse for days now, nothing could be done. The outside world, and all of its wonders, were nothing but a distant thought for Artyom, and after a sigh, he turned off the radio for the last time."

 RAD_RUS.2.desc:0 "The old man sat, like he did many days, just outside of the cabin on the hill in which he had lived for decades.\n\nSlowly, he rocked in his chair, an old, beaten radio sitting next to a pile of books, blaring out hectic announcements about the destruction of Germania, of Tokyo, of London and Rome, and of New York City. Even from his perch on this hill, he could see distantly the change in the color of the sky, some sort of wayward weapon launched into the Russian wastes. The Germans, no doubt. It was always the Germans.\n\nThe man sighed, wiping a tear from his eye, looking at the old red flag which he still hung from the wall next to his door.\n\nIn a well practiced movement, with shaky hands he slowly removed a weathered photograph. He looked at the figures in it, all so much younger back then. They were at their teacher's funeral, all of them. Before it had all gone so wrong... before he had played his own hand in destroying the world...\n\nThe old man pushed the photo back into his coat and turned off the radio. After contemplating the distant sky and wiping away a final tear, he stood up and walked inside, before firmly closing the door behind him.\n\nThe past was in the past, but all had to pay for it."

 RAD_RUS.3.t:0 "The Horde Rides" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.3.desc:0 "The bombs fell, and the bombs destroyed civilization as the world knew it. In some places, however, civilization had not truly existed, at least not for a long, long time.\n\nIn Western Russia, many died as the Germans, out of spite, dropped any spare nuclear weapons in their arsenal on Russia, perhaps out of a hope that the Russians would not be the ones to win the wastes.\n\nThis did not work, however, for the real damage made by a nuclear weapon is its effect on a society, and the Russians had already built a society well used to German bombs and atrocities. In the time after the bombs fell and the world went silent, the Russians continued as they had, fighting, pillaging, battling one another for land.\n\nIn West Russia, however, large bands of Russians, bandits and mercenaries, settlers and adventurers, all began the long trek west. In a horde they came, scaring off or destroying the struggling communities of Germans holding on in the wasteland, and slowly but surely, they drifted through Moskowien, through the remains of Poland, and into Germany itself."

 RAD_RUS.4.t:0 "The Second Sun" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.4.desc:0 "The SS would be forgotten, in time. Another remnant of an ancient civilization that would be left for the archaeologists of the future to theorize on. However, like many lost things of the last age, they would struggle for survival in this new world, furiously refusing to accept that what they once fought for was well and truly gone. Ashes and smoke, dust and dust.\n\nOne such splinter persisted in the land of Cossacks and grain for two decades after the collapse. The land they guarded was known as having once been a military base, though nobody could quite tell what was on it. The soldiers would shoot any who dared come near, whether the harried German survivors or the bandits of the east, and all the natives knew to avoid it.\n\nThe SS inside plotted, behind closed doors, to create a great second sun and purge clean the filth that inhabited what was once a great Empire. Nobody would ever know this, however, or the story of the one aged man, who in the uniform of evil stepped into the room where these men worked day and night to restore the great tools of war, armed with only a pistol and his faith.\n\nA second sun bloomed across the land that day, and nothing would show that the SS once persisted here besides the simmering remains of the missile base."

 RAD_RUS.5.t:0 "Faith and Fire" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.5.desc:0 "The small church survived the fires which wiped out Tyumen. Isolated as it was and bereft of anything valuable to steal, the building and its congregation survived the decades of hunger and cold that followed. The mayor had perished in the fires, and it was up to the local priest, an outcast of little note, to guide the villagers and refugees through the harsh times.\n\nIt was thirty years after the fires when the old Bishop died, his replacement elected from the priests he had appointed and the man himself given as luxurious a funeral as the village could provide. Sixty years after the fires ended, the first of the Great Warlords, claiming to be a reincarnation of Old Zhukov, strode through the small town square and proclaimed his dominion over what had become known simply as "Church Town" and its inhabitants for a thousand years hence. Soon his rival, the Chairwoman of a new Soviet Union based out of old Yugra, drove him over the mountains and back into Yakutia from whence he came, and she too proclaimed her rightful leadership over Church Town in front of the Bishop's mausoleum. A hundred and twenty four years after the ash fell, when the Fourth Chairman was slain by his own generals, the Archbishop took the opportunity to quietly stop paying taxes to his nominal liege.\n\nA hundred and eighty seven years after the world died, the Church Upon the Hill had become the center of a thriving if troubled trade city, constantly appeasing whichever of the Diadochi demanded tribute that year. A hundred and ninety three years after the smoke cleared, the Metropolitan of Tserkov' na Kholme proclaimed a holy Kingdom of his own atop the ashes of six armies sent to slay him and burn his city to the ground.\n\nThree hundred and two years after the bombs ended what was, a part of Rus was once again subsumed into a greater whole."

 RAD_RUS.6.t:0 "The Cossack" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.6.desc:0 "There had been a time, he was sure, when things were not quite so bleak. If he were to call back to his oldest memories, back when the Tsar had still reigned and Bukharin was but another member of the party, then he could even recall feeling joyous about the way in which the world was headed.\n\nUnder the Soviets things had been harsh of course, but all the same he had continued onwards in the sure knowledge that his nation would travel through the bitter age into one of light and joy. Then the Germans, carelessly, irreverently, callously destroyed everything he had valued in nought but a night. His family dead, his nation sundered - his spirit had broken. But as the old Cossack sat upon the hill, gazing upon the great mushroom clouds in the distance, something inside him awoke.\n\nWhen the villagers flocked to his house with question he answered and organized them into a militia to stop the inevitable bandit raids. When the disparate mix of former soldiers, some still wearing the robes of the vanished Red Army, passed through the village he recruited those of good temperament and spirit. When the long winter ended, an army set forth to bring peace to a motherland long wracked by war.\n\nThe task was not completed in his lifetime, nor that of his successor, or her successor after. But eventually, part of the motherland was peaceful and free from the tyrants who had for so long brought nothing but ruin to its people. For a time. And in the streets of what had once been Moscow, the vigilant traveler might find the lovingly preserved statue of the old Cossack."

 RAD_RUS.7.t:0 "And Just Because He's Human" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.7.desc:0 "What is a man?\n\nIs a man just a human being with intelligence? Is he a man because he can think and feel? No, for a slave can do that as easily as any man. His father had been a slave before the fires blotted out the horizon, beholden to the local officers and whatever bandit king was stronger than the rest on a given day. His death had only bound his family to the servitude he was shackled to in life.\n\nDoes a human become a man by belief, by some secret knowledge that in truth he is no bound to the will of another? His brother had believed that, right up until the moment the guards beat him half to death for talking back and finding he could do nothing. He hadn't lasted so long after that.\n\nMaybe what makes a man is birth? Some arcane and unknowable force that gives other men the power over others? But if that were true then the son of the old Baron would not be working here beside him, half starved and missing an eye. No, no liberation from above was evident, nor was any forthcoming.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that a man chooses. A slave obeys.\n\nAnd Vasily, youngest son of Ivan, worker in the mines, reflected that it might be time to stop obeying the overseer."
 RAD_RUS.7.a:0 "No kings, no lords, only men."

 RAD_RUS.8.t:0 "A man would like a little bite to eat" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.8.desc:0 "Hunger was an old friend to the people of the steppe. A gnawing, constant companion for those who lived on the edge of the known world. When crops failed, you felt hunger. When the sheep died, you felt hunger. When the lords and generals came for their taxes you felt hunger most keenly of all. For they took what was not theirs to take.\n\nIn times long past some of the elders claimed that things had not been this way - they spoke of times of plenty, where every man could eat his fill and nobody paid more tax than any other. But who amongst the lords and the army men would listen to the tales of some scum from the steppe? Even the wrath of Allah, raised against their decadent cities like blinding fire, had not been enough to crush them completely, for like rodents they emerged from the earth and rebuilt them.\n\nBut on this night, the young men of the clan were ready to prove to the army men and the lords that it was poor practice to take the food of a starving man and not make sure he was dead afterwards. Readying the old PPSH his grandfather so treasured, the boy watched silently as the column of men marched below the hillside below. It clung to his overalls, a chill presence.\n\nThen at the signal, he moved. Slowly the figures descended into the village - the peace of the night was lost amidst the screams and growing, rank smell of smoke."

 RAD_RUS.9.t:0 "He Wants No Bull and a Lot of Talk" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.9.desc:0 "The bunker was a dark and dreary place for civilization to have been displaced into, a concrete nightmare of dull edges and flat empty walls. The Commissar had been surprised the day he was told that if the worst happened, it would be himself and no other who would take charge of the survivors of Bunker A4. In retrospect he supposed it was no real promotion so much as it was sidelining him to allow the Major to promote his son to the position of regimental Commissar.\n\nBut the world was full of irony, and the Commissar was quite certain that neither the Major, his son or anyone else outside the bunkers was alive. The screams of those poor souls, rent in the inner parts by the aftereffects of nuclear annihilation, had ceased months ago anyway. He'd heard their cries drift into the dead static on the radios.\n\nNo, the trouble that the Commissar was running into was keeping high the spirits of those who were trapped in Bunker A4 with him. Those either selected for their skills or lucky enough to have been near the entrance when the sirens sounded were alive, which put them at a great advantage to their contemporaries, but they were growing restive. He kept up the patriotic speeches as much as he could. He reminded them that their survival was ensured with the rudimentary designs of the complex (at least until the food ran out or the water systems spoiled), and that to continue living both spited the hated enemy and honored the memory of the fallen.\n\nBut if he was honest, he was unsure how much good his speeches did. And if Bunker A4 had its own Commissar doubting the future, what could be said of its soldiers?"

 RAD_RUS.10.t:0 "That Gives No Bread or Meat" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.10.desc:0 "The crops had been poor one year too many. A single year of failed crops and people would curse, but they might go on with their lives afterwards and keep it as a bitter memory. Two years of failed crops was a disaster, but one that could be managed with stored foods and appropriate reductions in the taxes paid. Three years though, three years was dangerous. It implied something supernatural was punishing the village for its sins. Or, as some were whispering in the darker alleys and the tavern, the sins of its leaders.\n\nLocal Party Chairman Mikhail had tried to quell those rumors at first by donating out of his own stock three fine pigs for a village feast, but the villagers had been more interested in the fact that he could so easily give out three of the fattest pigs they had ever seen when the livestock on their own lands was so thin a breeze might blow it over. Boris had never considered himself the most socially observant of men but even he could see that the cauldron of poor decisions might easily boil over if the wrong actions were taken.\n\nWhich was why he now sat in the middle of the street, accordion in hand, singing a song his grandmother had taught him from her youth. The accordion sat uncomfortable in his hands, and he got sore easily, but old habits built from childhood were hard to erode. Quickly the Commissar's tune became steady and his song acquired a rustic strength to it.\n\nAt first the village folk were unsure of what was going on, and then the eldest amongst them began taking up the verse. Then the children, eager to please, added their fickle voices to the harmony. It took time, but eventually all in the village, from Old Mikhail to the drunken beggars, had joined the chorus.\n\nThe talks still took a few days afterwards, but the fire had cooled, and the village folk accepted that another year would be given a chance before action was decided. Everything had calmed, for now."

 RAD_RUS.11.t:0 "Erasing What Was" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.11.desc:0 "It had always been a quiet town, before the bombs. One of relative peace and quiet, situated comfortably in the eastern woods. Yet when the bombs fell, bringing great roaring flame to the cities of men, the peace was broken.\n\nIt was not the bombs that brought chaos to this quiet place, but those within. As the degradation of outside society occurred, the townsfolk felt the effects despite their separation. The cessation of all essential imports, the sudden lack of governance, the collapse of local security forces. Whilst not struck by the bombs, the town was still struck by utter disaster. And that was when the fanaticism erupted.\n\n"Remove all traces! Simple lives for simple men!" the leaders cried. "Let us never return to those corrupted ways!", they would proclaim, in reference to the technology upon which they all had once relied. A wave of anti-technological fervor swept the town. Vehicles were burned where they stood. Books educating upon any topics of technological significance were destroyed. Any piece of post-industrial technological progress was brought to ruin. Even firearms, initially used to enforce compliance with the destructive mob, had their ammunition expended and were in turn destroyed.\n\nYet what initially began as a flare of violent fervor, created the benefit of early adaptation to the new world. Unlike many societies, who would cling to the final operational facets of the industrialized world until it would spell their doom, the village found itself reverting to a rather primitive society within a very short period of time, forced by themselves to adapt quickly to the changing world.\n\nAs the years would drag on, and as the town survived many hardships, the reactionary fervor of days past was all but forgotten. The town would continue to stand the test of time, as progress was made to a brighter future once again. Only the lingering name of the village - Simple Town - was left to bear witness to the chaos which had once rocked it."

 RAD_RUS.12.t:0 "The Horse Lords" # Hooked Up
 RAD_RUS.12.desc:0 "In the boundless steppes that form the heart of the great continent, far from the great rivers and mountains, roams a growing nomadic society. The boundless grassy flats of the steppes have long been home to a plethora of different peoples. With the lands so well suited to grazing, pack animals and livestock herds became incredibly abundant. With so few conditions existing to attach the natives to their land, entire societies took to the saddle. Entire populations began to roam the steppes, with few permanent settlements dotted throughout the lands.\n\nThe phenomenon of mobile societies grew to be an increasingly common sight in the great steppe. Some roamed peacefully about the lands, tending to their livestock and moving when favorable, yet others took their mobility to a more aggressive advantage. Talk of roving societies of raiders upon horseback were spoken of in hushed voices. Great bands of mounted warriors traveled between settlements with an ultimatum; to present to them a tribute, or to face the sacking and plunder of their homes - eventually the riders grew drunk on their power and brought torment to all in their reach who remained rooted to their lands.\n\nThe evolution of a mobile society created many woes for the people of the steppes, and those surrounding it. Scarcely could one consider themselves distant from risk. Yet it also created great opportunity for those willing to seize it, by saddle and sword."

Cold, dark, and isolated, one would think the people of this far north land would be melancholy and quiet, concerned only with maintaining their meagre state of survival. Yet, this was never so in these days, in part because of the efforts of the Cirque. No one knew exactly where or when the Cirque was first founded, or what its motivations had ever been. No one knew exactly what a Cirque was, even--but that didn't stop them from enjoying it.\n\nThe Cirque traveled from town to town, settlement to settlement, commune to commune, spreading stories and mirth as they went. Popular with the young and the old alike, their stories sang of ancient ages, long past; ages where man conquered the sky and stars, where the land around them was united under one red banner, then blue, then black, then red again. Their stories inspired a vision for a future in the young and a nostalgia for the past in the old, exciting and invigorating them all.\n\nEach of the plays and dances of the Cirque were a source of hope and comfort to the people of this frigid country. Their songs told not only of the past, but of a vision of the future, one that urged the men, women, and children of the north onwards, to a brighter life ahead of them."

 RAD_RUS.14.desc:0 "No one could remember when Lenin died, and just as many could remember why exactly they guarded his corpse so zealously. For generations, the villagers surrounding the hovel that was once the city of Tyumen worked tirelessly to keep the casket that contained his corpse safe. Once, surely, they had known their purpose. They had known why this man was so important that generations should gladly give their lives to protect him.\n\nBut that was a long time ago, and now they worked day and night to protect little more than a skeleton. They did what they could to keep the body preserved, but the techniques and technology their ancestors had used so long ago had faded from memory. And so the venerated man in the casket had withered and faded until he was little more than bone, hair, and a suit. Even the man's name had faded from memory. The word Lenin remained, yes, but if this was his first or last name, none of them could say. The time had come to lay this man to rest, at long last.\n\nAnd so it was that a grave was dug and the body was lowered gently into the grave. As the people of what was once Tyumen buried the body, they felt a sense of closure. They were ending a chapter in their history. Perhaps a new one would soon begin."

 RAD_RUS.17.desc:0 ""For the inhabitants of Uralia, things certainly could have been worse. From what could be pieced together so long after the event, the cleansing flames had not affected the region much at all. At least, if one where to ask a traveler from the east or west, they would paint a picture of devastation that was simply not to be found in the snowy mountains where many had in fact fled to during the Great Exodus. While it is harsh and unforgiving, ask any Uralian if they would rather live somewhere else, and they would look at you with their red-rimmed eyes as if you were crazy.\n\nI had a chance to speak to several Uralians candidly about their history and legends while I was researching for this book, and found that there are many stories to be found in the shadow of those mountains. One legend of note concerned a rumored legion of ghost warriors who have appeared over the long years to cause chaos and violence. There may seem to be something to these rumors, for I have found documentations of entire villages going missing in recent years. However, my book examines the evidence and I believe that the nomadic tendency of the people of the Urals is the cause of these disappearances rather than anything supernatural. As for the source of the legend, I have also discovered interesting information regarding a pre-Catastrophe bandit gang that is the likely inspiration for these myths.\n\nAnother prominent regional superstition I investigated was that of the so-called "Shadow Mountain" where none but the bravest or most stubborn Uralian would dare approach sober. While questioning East Eurasians can often be a difficult task for a foreigner, I was met with even stiffer resistance than usual. Apparently it is an uncomfortable subject, though I confess that my lack of progress in this area makes speculation as to why this is the case difficult. Obviously the claims that a great demon resides under the mountain itself is nothing more than myth, but I remain disappointed in my inability to discover the context and explanation behind said myth..."\n\nExcerpt from "On the Legends and Superstitions of the East-Eurasian Peoples" by Kynrid Atum""

Tears streamed down, washing away the dirt that marred his hands, flowing past the gaps in his fingers; the first time in such long years.\n\n"What are you doing here, mister?" said a voice, childish and distant. "Are you lost?" He looked up, his eyes red. He stared at the child, a boy of nine, for some time, his lips unmoving. No nerve in his body could command them to open. Finally, his throat screeched a pathetic reply, "What?" He drew up the sleeves of his uniform. "Do you see this?" He pointed to his tattoos, tracing the swastikas as they snake their way through his arm. "I'm your enemy! You should fear me!" He strode forward only for his knees to fail him, and he landed face-first on the ground.\n\nThe child laughed. Valdemar groaned on the ground.

No matter what frequency he tuned it to, however, or how hard he smacked it, it received only static. Not to worry.

The black gold so valued in the old world was hard to come by, so far from the ruins of the Mountain Reich and its vast, arcane facilities. With no source of the strange, flammable liquid to hand, those elders who knew its secrets felt no need to pass their knowledge down to later generations. So it was that the horse, once obsolete to all save the impoverished nomads of the World-That-Was, became a dominant force on the battlefield once more.\n\nOf all the disparate tribes who remained in the harsh steppes north of the Three Seas, none were so fearsome as the Eagle Guard. Riders without compare, the Guard were born of the merging of two older and equally mighty tribes: the White Eagles, exiles from a verdant land far to the west, and the Gorno-gvardia, hard and cold-eyed men of the northern mountains who had come south seeking allies against the wicked Cult of the Hooked Cross. Once thought destroyed in the fires that consumed their original homeland, the Cult had constructed a new temple-city in the frozen north from which a new and horrific empire of slavery and genocide was spreading.\n\nAt the head of a grand coalition of southern tribes, the newly-formed Eagle Guard struck north, leading charge after charge into the howling blizzards. Even as their allies buckled and retreated before the frigid northern winds, the Guard was relentless in their advance. The battle was not yet lost so long as a single Guard and his horse kept fighting - and they numbered in the thousands. With gun, sword and lance, the Eagle Guard thundered through the Cult's lines like an unstoppable force of nature, the name of Saint Mendowicz on their lips. By the time the blizzards began to subside and green returned to the tundra, the Temple of the Hooked Cross was a smoking ruin, and the banner of the Straight and True Cross flew over the palace of the Aryan Priest-King.\n\nThis is the most famous of their tales, but far from the last. Even today, the Eagle Guard spreads its wings across the steppes, banishing evil and Aryan devilry wherever it might be found."

All across the scattered steppe and cold expanses of tundra, men and women woke up, got dressed, and carried on with their day. Many nations continued in some sense, for better or for worse. The Tale of the Black Mountain of the latter.\n\nIn the center of the old land was the Black Mountain. Before the war, the surrounding region was ruled by a maniac, whose perverted experiments lingered in the public memory long after his name was forgotten. The Thinker, as he came to be known, was obsessed with the concept of human purity and the refinement thereof. He believed that athleticism, intelligence, even morality could be made a function of chemical formulas and trauma, observed and tested for through vile experimentation on live humans. The Thinker knew no ethical restraint, exposing his unwilling subjects to boiling heat and freezing cold, unproven pharmaceuticals, or physical torture; nothing was too depraved.\n\nWhen the bombs fell, the Thinker himself survived in his mountain. In the years following the Last War, he used the fruits of the apocalypse to conjure up newer, more horrific experiments. In time, the Black Mountain ruled over the land in much the same way as before the War.\n\nBut for all his depravity, the Thinker never produced anything in the Mountain other than misery. His crimes against humanity went unpunished, as he died in his sleep. Perhaps that is the lot of man. To suffer and to toil against terrible powers outside of their control, and then pick up the fragments after their suffering is through."

There, he was awaited by the only man that could possibly be hitting the bell, the only other priest in the town. After hastily greeting him, Andrei asked what was happening, and the answer he got was simple: no one knew. Major cities in the region were disappearing, and people told tales of utter destruction and chaos wherever these massive explosions were happening. The priest thought he had an idea of what was going on, though.\n\nAndrei grabbed the Bible and quickly looked through its pages. As he did so, he recited verses he could remember, that all had something in common, something they revolved around: the Second Coming. The Day of Judgment by God Himself had come, and those who served him would join him in heaven, while those who did not would burn in hell. Holding the Bible in his hands, he ran to the grand entrance of the building and looked at the town for one last time. Seconds later, he was blinded by the lights. In his last few moments, he thought of his family, his home, and above all, Him. The time to join Him in heaven had come. The heathens would be proven wrong."

Assembling the tribal councils of old, and gathering their texts and manuals, the Nenets moved south, bringing life to dying villages and starving people. Refugees from the south were taught the arts of hunting the reindeer and identifying edible plants. City dwellers were instructed in the old rites of preparing mushrooms and purifying melted snow, and former military were taught how to utilize the bow and arrow once the bullets ran out.\n\nWhen the winter lifted, and the brief, weak summer once more caressed the people of the far north, the sun did not fall on a field of frozen corpses, but on a new, toughened and enlightened civilization.

This king related to his followers the tale of a man called Kell - a bandit with a heart of gold who struck back against the corrupt and wicked enforcers of his nation's law, robbing the rich to give to the poor. In a greatcoat and armour of iron, Kell walked the land, delivering justice to the downtrodden and slaying all who would exploit them for gain.\n\nIt was in the spirit of this legend that the descendants of the king's retainers fought back when the yoke of oppression reached out from the west to plant the Red Hook in their spines. Cladding themselves in scrap metal, the Band of Kell fought back against their conventionally-equipped foes with the vigour of tundra warriors emboldened by the spirit of the long-dead patron. Many fell despite their armour, but ultimately they triumphed, shattering the army of the Red Hook upon the shores of the frozen lake.\n\nThe Battle of the Iron Shore went down in legend for the inhabitants of the area. Long after the Band of Kell had passed from the world, the tales of Old Kell and his knights, who traveled from a distant land to defend its people from the evil Lord of the Red Hook, would be the founding legend of a dynasty and the genesis of a kingdom to rival the greatest of the east."

What was all that for? Each believed in something different, unique ways to govern their lands, and unique ways to achieve peace and prosperity. Their thoughts mattered little when the Great Fire torched them all to the ground. They struggled for survival, yet they never deigned to seek help from their enemies. And when the fathers that had led these states for years relayed their knowledge and wishes to their children, their key instructions were simple: do not let others take your town.\n\nTheir children did not let them win, and neither did their grandchildren. For generations after the Great Fire, the wars continued. However, slowly, the lines dividing their beliefs began to fade away. The original ideas from before the Fire were twisted and changed, and the mysterious names to describe them were forgotten with the passage of time. In the end, the four states came to a realization. What were they fighting for? No one could remember, and it seemed that all that they believed in was the destruction of their enemies and nothing else. But their ancestors, who cemented these ideas, were long gone. So did these states come together. Their new leaders came into an agreement, and from then, a new nation was formed.

A great gasp arose from the Scribers as they painstakingly read and checked its content. It was a Book of Danger, one tied to the great horror of the Fire itself, and its magicks and daemonic utterances had to be checked at any cost.\n\nThe little hamlet gathered in the ceremonial public square, so called because it had never before been used except for the rare public execution of a murderer, and the book was gingerly laid with trembling hands at the top of a pyre constructed for the occasion. Chanting in the AnteDoiche dialect - the closest, it was said, to the words spoken before the Fire - the Scribers and the elders of the village threw torches into the pyre, setting it alight. The book crisped and burned quick in the evening air. Fragments of lettering flew up into the sky, their embers like fireflies in the dying light - one large piece of paper, with MEIN KAMPF written on it, rose in the heat like a sigil before it, too, was crisped to black."

 RAD_EU.12.desc:0 "The Baron looked through the ancient floor-plans, frowning as he did so. It was clear, even to the untrained eyes, that the house had once been much, much bigger than its present confines. The titles of this Downing Street, if that was the right name for it, had stretched for many yards across the length of the Old City. Only this house remained, shielded by some act of Providence from the Inferno. It was half-crumbled - most of the back-portion of the house had fallen into itself - and the brick-walls sprouted verdant green stripes, and what must once have been a gate was warped with heat into unrecognizable curves.\n\nEven so, the Baron thought it worth preserving, and perhaps one day restoring. He gave orders for his men to clear the rubble around the site, repurposing them for settlement construction around the rings of the Old City. Perhaps the Wise Men of his House would be of aid in this. He summoned them in the fall to begin plans for restoration of the estate. But the touch of scarlet-plague interrupted his plans, and that fall the House met not to plan, but to mourn.\n\nDecades passed. The house continued to fall in on itself. One day a Sage of the Court paid a visit to what had once been the Baron's prize project. He walked around the grounds of the house, now no more than a suggestion conjured by crumbled walls and broken brick-dust. The gates remained twisted and tangled, their shadows broad in summer light. He made up his mind: he would speak to the King.\n\nMore decades passed. The house began to rise in a haze of scaffolding - strange new stones were erected in place of what had once been sturdy brick, but the outline of the house rose anew into the sky. Elegant curved leaf-patterns, some still bearing the imprints of ancient fire, curled across the estate, metal dancers swept in some wild tune. Children ran through them, laughing. Watching their outlines merge and twist in the shadows of evening, it was easy to forget that the house had been a place of loss - and the past seemed to melt away into the forgiving embrace of the waters of time."

I can tell you that they're there, hiding in the forgotten spaces of the land, just as they always have been. I saw them with my own eyes, and let me tell you, it was truly a sight to behold. Their horses are trained from birth to bear the burdens of armor and heavysuits the Knights wear, meaning they require much more feed than other Knightly Orders. So it was in a farming town that I chanced upon them on business.\n\nThe Knights stole the crowds' hearts as they galloped into the town square. Their brilliant white-red insignia and their Crosses of Lead made them the brightest thing in that town. You could hear the ladies swoon. But what was remarkable was the way in which they moved. I've never seen a troop of riders move with such efficiency, dignity or grace. Nor have I seen men so silent and professional on the hunt, when I had the privilege of hunting with them. But they are a friendly people, make no mistake about it.\n\nI have heard stories about the Knights' origins. Some say they were birthed out of the chaos of the Cleansing, the product of mating between the unyoked war machines and men and women of the land. Some also say that they perform those same rituals still in ceremonies hidden from the face of God. But from what I can tell, the greatest surprise is that these men are perfectly normal, simply well-trained and disciplined. Perhaps the Panzer in their name was an instrument of skill and efficient bloodletting, for they have inherited something of the same spirit. Hell, I might even join them again, just to learn how to ride my steed like they ride theirs."

But an abundance of fear can drive men to madness, and as the world burned and the old world was lost and forgotten, men who had been used to lives of relative comfort became deathly afraid of the world around them. When all the world seems like a beast, wild and savage with the blood of friends and enemies, mens' minds grow dark. They are drawn to the hidden spaces where nightmares lurk, where the past, present and future are all equally terrifying.\n\nA belief would rise in the lands to the west of the great Black Sea, a belief that the end of the world was not an isolated incident but a recurrent one. God had punished man for its wickedness and brought down a calamity upon the earth, much like he had done before when he drowned all the world save for Noah and his ark. God's first punishment had been water, and his second had been fire. Therefore, it would stand to reason that if man did not change its ways, another elemental fury would be wrought upon the wretched sinners of the world.\n\nOne scholarly, pious man would spend three days in study of the Bible, and divined that the next apocalypse would occur within a year. He would urge his growing flock of doomsday theists to rid the land of all that was unholy, that they might be spared the horrors of judgement and be welcomed by God into heaven. His followers would swarm the land, slaughtering those they found to be welcoming the devil's sin and burning icons and texts of an unholy nature. When all was said and done they would join their savior on a hill and await the coming of the Lord.\n\nWhen no third end nor visage of God became apparent, the assembled masses would become confused. Distraught. Angry. Had they convinced the Lord to call off his final judgement? Had they got the wrong date? Had they simply been lied to? The mob's murmuring would become a chorus, and the chorus an unholy roar. Perhaps the man who had led them here was himself a sinner? And so the mob would burn their leader, as they had burned many others. When that did not bring them the promised rapture they would turn on each other, until the few that remained after the bloodshed would return to their homes, resigned to the knowledge that the new world, for better or worse, was here to stay."

As a King he was noble, wise and fair, and his courtiers and subjects loved him for his benevolent character. In time he would take a Queen, one who he would love like no other in the world.\n\nOne day, the Queen fell very ill. The King's physician discovered that she had caught the Tumors, and that she was unlikely to last more than a few years more. Distraught, the King turned to his scholars in the desperate hope of finding a cure. Yet none could be found. And so the King instead turned to the people who loved him so, and promised to whoever could discover a cure for her affliction would be rewarded with whatever was in his power to grant.\n\nA gallant Knight heard of his plea, and embarked upon a quest to find the cure. After searching high and low, first throughout the Kingdom, then the isles themselves, he finally found the answer. An old wise woman told him of an ancient cure held by the old ones, used to eliminate or, at the very least, stem the tide of the Tumors. The secrets of its production had been lost, but stashes of them could still be found if one knew where to look. This great panacea had a name - the Chemo.\n\nAfter further research, the Knight finally discovered a source for the Chemo. He rode far south to the halls of St Bartholomew in the lands of Kent, only to find that its ancient walls had been occupied by the forces of the Hun-Beyond-the-Sea, in some mad effort to retake the isles through an ancient claim. In the name of his King, and in the name of the isles, the brave Knight told the plight of his Queen to all who would hear, and before long he had gathered a small host of warriors to claim the halls.\n\nAfter a long and hard battle, the Knight was victorious, and the invaders were driven back into the sea. Claiming his prize, he returned to Scotland and presented his panacea to the King. The Chemo was administered to the Queen, and though she lost her long flowing hair in the process, she was granted many more years with her beloved. The King offered the Knight anything he desired in return for his brave quest.\n\nIn the end, all the Knight requested for his troubles was to have the honor of serving at his King's side; he would continue to serve him and the people of his Kingdom for all his days."

They labored for three days and three nights, beating the windows of the fallen spacecraft with rocks, stones, and even a few rusted tools.\n\nOne day, the black barrier gave way, and as the first tribesmen stuck his head in and breathed the dusty air, what he saw amazed and terrified him.

They armed themselves with the stone axes and picks they had before used to build their homes. Some stole the rusted iron tools the king hoarded for himself, deep in the rusted mine the village had been built around so many years ago.\n\nAs one, the people stormed the King's home, and, carrying him on their shoulders, threw him into the mine. Then they used the tools they had brought to chip away at the very foundations of the ancient mine, and collapsed it in on their tyrant king.\n\nThe people celebrated for three days and three nights, for never again would they bow to a tyrant such as the king they had buried. As they danced and sang, a strange idea formed. No one was quite sure who first whispered it into another's ear, but soon they had all heard of the bold new proposal for their lives.\n\nThey, the people, would come together as a village, and discuss their problems. They would cast their own votes, and whichever ideas had the most votes would be implemented. Never again would a King rule them. The idea quickly took hold upon the youth, and even the elderly found it had a certain romantic charm to it.\n\nThe first vote was on the topic of names. Their prized tradition of having no names was an invention of the kings, some argued, and they should give themselves names as the oldest of their ancestors once did.

He would simply visit a town with a bag full of strange needles on his person, travel from house to house and ask if its residents require protection from the plague. He administered treatments most bizarre when they agreed: first he would wrap an arm tight with a bandage, then gently pushed the needle of a strange contraption beneath their skin. From there he filled the contraption with strange potions, that they may flow directly onto the puncture wound and into the corpus.\n\nHow the Good Doctor's treatment exactly worked remains a mystery, but those who did found themselves free of the pustules and blisters that mark the plague's presence. As he treated more of the land's people, the plague slowly began to subside. The towns and cities he had saved celebrated merrily, but he never stayed long enough to partake in them -- only a day or two, in fact, before he headed to another place that needed his treatments. Once every town, village and city acquired the Good Doctor's treatments, it is said, he disappeared from the isles and joined its myths and legends.\n\nTo this day, physicians and doctors swear an oath to help all those in need, just as the Good Doctor had."

There is much evidence prevalent in the historical record that lends credence to the existence of such an event, such as the near complete void of cultural data that has been uncovered past the Shadow Ages, but also recent revelations of advanced technological innovations apparently developed prior to this event - for instance the so called "Nigma Device" that excited archaeologists last year, as well as the many hulking wrecks of ancient steel warships found by divers over the last few decades.\n\nWhile the nature of what we shall term the Post-Antediluvian Collapse (henceforth P.A.C) has been lost to time, a multitude of theories have been posited by those seeking to better understand this difficult era of human history. Creek and Jianqi, et al. posit a notion in their paper "The Population Bottleneck" that, as evidenced by the Hulme quotient of the skeletal structure of bodies recovered from before the P.A.C, humankind experienced a drastic decline in fertility that resulted in a collapsed population and a complete breakdown in societal order. Though the validity of Hulme's theories in bioprediction are disputed, this theory is currently the most widely accepted of explanations for the collapse.\n\nThe issue is far from settled, however. In Konyevske's paper "Radiography in Anthrogeological Studies," she suggests instead that the heightened radioactive state of P.A.C artifacts that have been recovered to date may hold a clue as to the fate of the ancient world; that some radiological event of massive scale must certainly have occurred to cause such an anomaly. Other (though less accepted) theories include a worldwide outbreak of Phage, a collapse of oxygen levels, a significant alteration in solar activity and a major cosmological impact event. More controversial scholars suggest that the Antediluvian world is actually a myth, such as the First World school of historical thought that states..."\n\n- Excerpt from "Ponderings on the Historical Void", Authored by Dr. Gunthir Parlya of the University of New Atiles, Department of Anthrogeology."

 RAD_EU.45.desc:0 ""Don" Giovanni cursed both his good and bad luck as the gondola coursed through the lagoon.\n\nRight next to him sat La Dona Bella. The moonlight struck against her pale features and black hair to give both an almost supernatural glow. His head snapped away when the beautiful visage turned to him with a questioning gaze, equal parts shame and headiness filling his mind. Stupid, stupid, stupid!\n\nHe never thought he'd get the talk of the city with lies alone. The uniform wasn't his, not truly, having been acquired from an old ruin. Neither were the "tales of heroism" he had regaled the Dona his either; about half was gleaned from a picture book before the Fall, and the other half was his bluster alone. He sighed and turned to the window, doubt cycling through his mind.\n\nThe lagoon had grown since he first remembered it. Back then it was nothing more than a small lake by the town of Serenisma. As the years pass it somehow grew more and more, just like the edge of the horizon suddenly filled with water, and now they had to use boats instead of carriages to travel its sights. For some reason, however, the new water seemed to fit Serenisma perfectly, like glove to hand. Arches and channels, once old roads, were just the right length for boats to travel and pass through.\n\nHis doubt grew as they entered the inner districts. Fancy houses, homes of high society. Not like the shanties and slums he was accustomed to before Father Grigori had taken him in. As the gondola stopped and slowed into a small wooden pier, Giovanni sighed resignedly. Might as well send the lady off properly. Standing up, the "Don" bade Dona Bella his leave.\n\n"It... it was a pleasurable outing, Dona Bella," he began. "M-mayhaps that we can see each oth-"\n\nHis lips felt the warmth and softness of another. Pulling away in shock, he saw the Dona Bella's pale yellow eyes and her mirthful smile."

Or to pawn them off for a day's meal.\n\nThe scavenger grunted as she shifted the debris of a ruined building in what had once been called Frankfurt. While other, more intact buildings had been picked clean over the decades, these mounds of detritus could hold many interesting finds. Old ratty banners that could be stitched into clothing, scrap metal that could serve as firm construction material, and other sundries that an interested fellow might be willing to trade a bowl of soup for. As her efforts bore fruit and debris was cleared, revealing a crumbled room, a glimmer caught the scavenger's eye.\n\nTaking the bauble carefully in her hands, she marvelled at how pretty it was despite the wear and tear. An old badge, bordered in gold and the faded script of her ancestors - as with most of her village, the script was unreadable to her. And in pride of place in the middle of the badge, was that old twisty cross. The same cross etched into all the ruins. The same cross emblazoned on the ancient hulks of steel that dotted the landscape. The same cross sewn into the banners now worn as a sling by her uncle and a robe by her mother and a dress by her beloved.\n\nIt had been important, once. Perhaps not for the right reasons.\n\nShe wondered whether Old Man Heinrich would add it to his collection in return for some stew.

Then would come the authority of the city restored, who would drive out the gangs and claim the vault for the day Geneve would finally be restored to greatness. After came petty lords, warbands, entire armies laying siege to the city with the express hope of controlling the sacred vault and its divine contents.\n\nFinally there came a great warlord from the Reichslunds. At his back lay a mighty host, and at his side an engineer who had uncovered the secret of black powder. Aiming to put an end to the ambiguity once and for all, he would open the contents of the vault to the outside world, ending untold ages of preservation. After putting the city above to the torch, he stood before the great metal door. With a loud bang the engineer's concoction ignited, and the door was finally sprung free.\n\nThe great lord's heart quivered with anticipation. Would he find untold riches?

It had long since died and its bones lay exposed to the elements - but the young men were filled with the apathy that is the gift of youth.

When people are desperate, they may turn to even the strangest of sources for comfort, and when the people came to see the hero-king Arthur, the king saw no reason to disabuse them of their mass delusion.\n\nNow, as living things eventually do, the king died, and the news caused panic amongst the people who had viewed this self-proclaimed legend as their divinely guided protector. It was then that the son of the king made a fateful choice. He donned the robes of his father and addressed the crowds of his subjects who stood nervously at the castle gate. King Arthur was not dead at all, for he was now King Arthur. Just because the holder of title was gone did not mean the title was meaningless or hollow.\n\nKing Arthur was an idea, a model for just leadership and righteous authority. In time, the house of that first king would fall from grace; they had abused their power and position and were no longer fit to hold the role of Arthur. Many more families would at some point or another take possession of the right to hold the title, but all would eventually be found wanting. At last, it was determined that as a true leader of the people, the Arthur should be accordingly chosen from among the people themselves. To be called Arthur is to be the defender of all, it is a responsibility that few are worthy to bear, and yet anyone can, if they commit themselves to a life of selfless devotion to our beloved nation."

Now, another empire has collapsed, and the monk knew the world would go on, and like their ancestors of old, the priests must preserve as much of the old world's knowledge, for the benefit of the new.\n\nThe local monks and priests would copy down every book in the village, big or small, in languages alive or dead, repeatedly. They would write, learn, and they would understand, so they would remember.\n\nWord got around, and a stream of merchants would come in and sell ink, paper, and books. The villagers were eager to buy, and insisted the travelers leave with a book or two, in the hope that knowledge would propagate throughout the world. And people came from all around not to sell, but to learn, to think, and to discuss. Soon, the village had grown, filled with scientists, artists, writers, philosophers, and students. Now, it would be a bright spot of learning and knowledge in a dark continent, thanks to a distant memory in a foresightful monk."

Whatever even actually once bound the group together was also forgotten, with thanks attributed to the long hot walks across the plains. It mattered little though these days, for the group had found a new purpose and direction in their self-appointed leader. He was a tall, bald man who called himself "The Chief". It was a grandstanding, and rather egotistical, nickname, but the group could not help but go along with it. For the man commanded... a certain aura. Some party members had heard about similar charisma attached to the leaders of the past that had ruled before the dropping of the bombs. Dangerous, oily and oozing charm. However, the group's collective memory had become far too hazy to recall the names or faces of these rulers. Few could even really recall the names of the countries they had once belonged to - if they had belonged to any at all.\n\n"How far do you reckon, Chief?" shouted one of the men trailing off at the back of the party's caravan.\n\n"Ah - not long, my friend, not long at all." The Chief yelled confidently. It appeared to be enough to put the man's mind to rest.\n\nThe group would often encounter a wide range of bandits in their long march to The Chiefs designated location. This was what truly brought the group together under The Chief's guidance. They fought like brothers whenever they entered into a hostile environment and every victory would spur the group on to follow The Chief with even more devotion. Wherever they were heading no longer mattered, as did the duration of their walk. All were content and happy to just keep on walking, seemingly until the end of time."

It had reached the point that there was not a single individual in the community of Ostpar who could even definitively explain what the building was or what it had been used for. They only remembered the warning their parents had given them when they were young, and those very same parents had heard much of the same admonitions from their parents too.\n\nIt was not that no one had ever thought about challenging the local superstition either. A few of the older residents of Ostpar, often in their attempts to dissuade curious youngsters, would tell a story of just such an attempt. An out-of-towner from the east of the Duchy had managed to actually get his hand on the door of the dark complex before fainting from a curse. That was how the old-timers remembered it at least, but no one was ever stubborn enough to find out if touching the door actually caused fainting.\n\nSome claimed the building was the house of an evil spirit, while others insisted that it was the old palace of the first, 'Mad' Duke of Burgundy, a figure out of legend and myth. Most didn't actually care what its original role had been. It didn't bother them if they didn't bother it, and they certainly weren't going to do anything close enough to it that it might perceive as "bothering". One day they would tear it down and salt the earth it had stood upon, they would say in meetings of the village council, but then again, that line had been said so many times that it had lost all meaning.

They were going to die very soon. That was why they were playing Mozart's Requiem. It seemed funny, in a very disturbing sort of way, to the wizened old Conductor, to play such a song. As he picked up his baton, he let out a derisive chuckle, "I'm not sure about you all, but I never imagined I'd go out listening to Mozart myself. I happen to be more of a Schubert man to be honest." A few laughs, a handful of grunts, maybe a sob. It didn't matter one bit to the Conductor if they found his gallows humor funny or not. He had already begun to stir up the strings.\n\nThe music picked up in earnest, all at once like water rushing out from a bursting dam. The Conductor had always preferred to have his orchestra play in smaller venues or better yet, privately, for the music's sake. Yet as heard the strains of the violins, the wave-like rolling of the cellos, what he wished for more than anything was an audience. How they would have marveled, how they would have been enraptured! The frantic, desperate air of inevitable destruction that was given to the playing was elevating this performance high above any that had ever been heard by mortal ears, the Conductor thought to himself as he let his baton drop. They no longer needed direction; they were being carried along by devotion to the craft, devotion to beauty.\n\nThe music seemed to finish as quickly and as suddenly as it had begun, the echoes of the last refrain hanging heavily in the air.

The only real way to comprehend the situation was for the warriors to go see it for themselves.\n\nIn the wake of what was assumed to be total destruction, those who were long assumed to be dead or missing in action emerged from the woods, the mountains and the vaults. But it was not to celebrate the freedom they have earned, nor to reunite with their families.\n\nThe sight of the greatest cities of their country flattened and turned into nothing more than a crater covered in smoldering ruins was too much for many. Some went back to their hiding spots to continue their life in isolation, far from the civilized world. Some simply took the weapons they had used to kill others for years, and turned them against themselves. A few, who saw beyond their own survival and satisfaction, remained in the areas, to care for those that had suffered and help piece the old world back. But for the vast majority of the Resistance, the world had not been freed. The weapons that they saw as tools for power and threats between the Great Powers had been used for the most evil purpose imaginable, and Greece had been caught in the cross-fire."

Perhaps it was some kind of learned experience from generation to generation that enabled anyone born in this land to remember what once stood before. Or, more likely, it was because the old lot never shut up about the past. Whatever the reasons, remembrance still rang strong in the land people now called The Erin. The original name had unfortunately not survived the great fires that kissed the island, but memories of this land's past lived on in the survivors of said attack. When efforts at rebuilding began decades ago, it was made sure of that the restoration of society echoed that of the old.\n\nIn a darkened pub, sat two friends sipping their drinks as the day closed to an end. Hunting was difficult... "As it was once in an age before you know", the elderly among the community loved to say. The two mates, however, were simply reaping what they sowed through a couple of well-deserved drinks.\n\n"A couple more?" said one man to the other.\n\n"Sure, why not, what's the harm?" his friend retorted.\n\nOf course, what transpired would be a wreck of a night.

The people of Feodorstapol were frightened, and assembled around it - armed with weaponry that they hoped to breach its hull and slay the great mechanical beast\n\nIt was then that the man emerged from a hatch, hands raised, bleeding. His uniform was shredded, and in his gloved hand, he carried a metal tablet, inscribed with the wheel emblem of the Great Reykh. With his dying breath, he spoke to the mayor of what is now Feodorstapol, in hushed whispers, and agitated curses. On the tablet, he had hammered the greatest secrets of the Reykh, atomic codes, the means through which Man may conquer the world once more. He spoke until his eyes filled with blood, and his skin began to flake off.

A few of them were skeptical, but most were embarrassed to remember they'd never formally taught their kids much of anything other than how to work, and agreed to her modest terms.\n\nMiss Jackson's curriculum seemed very disorganized, if it even existed at all. Every day she'd gather up the kids from all the houses who were pitching in for her lodging and pool them all together in some ruined old building she had halfway cleaned up a room inside of, to serve as her classroom. The children weren't given any homework to do, or taught anything in the ways of maths or sciences. Instead, Miss Jackson would tell them little stories about the way things worked in the old world, and answer any questions they had about the purposes of any relics of that era they stumbled across.\n\nHer first day in town, a short little boy asked her why so many of the buildings that were around in the olden days were so tall: didn't the people know they'd all fall down some day? Miss Jackson gave the boy a kindly smile and explained to her class that people used to make tall buildings so they could fit more rooms in a smaller space; back then, space was at a premium, and buildings had to be tall so they could make good use of the spot of space they had. Weeks later, one of the older girls asked her what people used to wear before the world ended, and Miss Jackson calmly explained that they wore most anything they could think of to wear, and that crazy new ideas for clothes swept everyone up in a frenzy every new season to buy all the latest clothes, even if their old ones hadn't worn out. One of her students never asked Miss Jackson any questions, though, and on her last day before leaving town, Miss Jackson decided to single out the quiet boy and ask him what he wanted to know about the old world.\n\nThe boy paused and kept silent for awhile, but eventually he asked, "Miss Jackson, why were all the people back then so silly?".\n\nMiss Jackson smiled, and she told the boy, "They were all so silly because they didn't have me around to teach them.""

Before the explosion that rocked the world all that time ago, Germania was the greatest of all nations, larger and stronger than any of her peers. Her army was the grandest in the world, and it was an attempt to destroy it that ended the old way of humanity, and reduced our ancient cities to ruin. Germania achieved such strength because she was a mother with many children, who used the best traits of all of them to maintain her preeminence in the world. So many small parts of this old empire all called Germania mother, but each of them still knew that they were their own lands with their own identities.\n\nOne of the most astounding of these children of Germania was Wien, in the south, who held sway over all the land where the mountains rise. Another was Salut, in the west, an estranged sister of Germania, where the people spoke a different tongue from the rest of Germania's daughters. One more was the land of Han, whose founder was the namesake of all men named 'Han' today. He was a legendary sailor from the far north, where the ground ends and the world sea begins, who once made a journey by boat to conquer another land--the island of Britannien--as a gift to Germania.\n\nThough the people of all these countries understand their common lineage from mother Germania, they do not still call themselves brothers and sisters. The Bavars fight ferociously against the tribes of the Wien for their continued independence from them, even as they would call them cousins. So too is it with the rest of what was once Germania: her children have grown up, and share all the same rivalries any two family members might. The name of Germania and of the wonders she brought to the world will never be forgotten, but still: no man alive today would ever consider himself to be among those ancient ancestors of ours, the Germanians. Germania died when the bombs fell, and her children shall live on in their own names, not in hers."

Perhaps when the world figuratively went to the wolves it did so literally as well. Whatever their source, they were a menace now, but a menace with lots of useful bits for someone resourceful like her to chop off and make use of to keep her alive.\n\nIn a clearing in front of her, near to the horizon, she saw them. A small pack, just six. They'd killed a young deer and mostly picked it clean already. Only the tiniest one was still eating, the runt of the litter subsisting off the alpha's scraps. He didn't have much meat on his bones, but it wasn't his meat that she was after. She crouched down low to the ground and stayed still, waiting for the pack to move on. When they did, she took aim, and killed the young wolf with a single crack shot. The rest of the wolves would obviously have heard her, but they wouldn't come back for the odd one out of the pack.

 RAD_EU.95.desc:0 "From time immemorial, men had met at Mary's Chapel in what was once called Edinburgh. Yet, they did not meet in Mary's Chapel to pray. Mary's Chapel, despite the innocuous-sounding name was a lodge of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons.\n\nThe members of this society had met for hundreds of years, speculating about the moral lessons that could be derived from the working tools of operative stonemasons. Symbols like the hammer, the chisel, the square, and the compass had illuminated their lives and inspired their moral improvement. Their numbers had dwindled for a long time under the suppression of the old regimes, and the fires of the calamity nearly finished them off. Yet, a select few had survived to emerge in the new world.\n\nSurrounded by ruins, the survivors once more had need of the traditional skills of masonry. The craft of constructing great edifices was in high demand, and the survivors of that Lodge used their working tools - so lovingly preserved and replicated over the ages - to revive the operative traditions of Freemasonry. While circumstances forced masonry to once more focus on the practical aspects of its trade, the masons looked forward to a day when the world was enlightened enough to return to speculation about the Divine in the hallways that birthed them."

Their state, whatever it used to be, was not a primary target of the great empires of old. Whatever country they had once served, the words they had given it remained to last: The Legion is our Fatherland.\n\nAs this venerable brotherhood had members from many peoples across many climes and lands, it naturally embodies a cosmopolitan outlook in this new age. Its leadership cared not for divisions of race, which they believed was the primary cause of the catastrophe that doomed the Old World to extinction. It would gather its members together to form polities across the great sea. These city-states welcomed in all those seeking shelter from the ravages of the war, as long as they were willing to pledge allegiance to the Legion, their new fatherland.\n\nThe legionaries and their league of cities would endure as a powerful force in the new world. Never forgetting their military origins, they formed a strong defensive army that protected their civilization from any would-be invaders. The Legion would stand united for many generations, embodying the brightest ideals of a post-calamity world."

Far more than the volcano at the island's centre, the raiders on their ships of metal made life a never-ending trial of misery, hungry winters and fruitless harvests. Their island's history was one of devastation; first, the great deluge had come, washing away all traces of civilization on the coastline. A century later, from the same direction as the first great waves, the raiders had arrived in their long, fast ship, bristling with guns that could destroy a village from beyond the horizon. From their steel stronghold far distant from the shore, they could strike forth at a moment's notice, razing a village to the ground before pillaging its entire harvest in a matter of hours. When they came ashore, they came with gleaming weapons far more deadly and accurate than the antiquated wooden rifles passed down among the scattered farming families.\n\nBut one day, as the lookout in the tiny village of Tantillo reached for his brass horn to warn the villagers of the vessel he had spotted rounding the bay, a long, low whooshing filled the air. Craning his neck to look skywards in the direction of the sound, he saw something glimmering in the midday sun: three triangular objects, fashioned of metal and moving at an impossible speed. In mere seconds they had streaked through his entire field of vision, bypassing the village and bearing down on the ship. As the whooshing grew to a deafening roar, something streaked down from each shape and struck the vessel amidships with a trio of explosions, just like the ones that had torn apart a dozen villages. When the smoke cleared, the vessel was rapidly listing and gushing a black liquid into the sea, while individual raiders abandoned ship to flail in the tainted waves.\n\nWhen the sentry looked back up, the metal shapes were little more than dots in the pale blue sky, soaring ever higher until they disappeared into the clouds. From that day until his last, Fabrini would never forget the angels of iron who had saved his village from destruction with their godly thunderbolts."

After spending some time to gaze reverently at the pale sky, the farmer shook himself out of his contemplative mood and set to his work for the day.\n\nAt noontime, with the sun high above his head and beating upon his neck, he paused in his labor to stretch his legs and eat his lunch. He walked a little ways to his favorite spot to eat on his land, a mid-sized pond that had begun its life as a crater from some long forgotten war. As he ate his meal, he reflected upon the crater, and upon the war that caused it, and upon the Disaster. There was no one left who had actually lived through the disaster, and there was also no longer anyone who remembered anyone who had either. Everything the farmer knew about life before that event came from stories he had heard from his parents as a child, who had themselves presumably been told by their parents, and back through the generations. He wondered what those people who had caused such destruction that none could even tell how that destruction had been wrought had lived. Perhaps they had all lived in luxury, never knowing toil at all, and this disconnection from the process of life was what caused them to destroy themselves. Or maybe they had lived so fiercely and barbarically that such destruction seemed to them as perfectly normal. Who could say? These questions were interesting of course, the farmer thought to himself as he retuned to his fields, but were hardly a real concern of his. No, he would concern himself with feeding himself and his family.

From this chest he pulled forth two ancient bindings of what my father taught me is called 'paper' in the High Tongue.The elder stepped over to the table and opened the bindings and let me examine their script. I could not read any of it, for they were written in the Old Runes. The elder explained to me that the first binding was a collection of the prophecies of the Time of the Gods, and that the second was a record written down by the ancestors of our tribe soon after the Great Fire. The elder admitted to me that he was unable to decipher all of the script due to the age of the bindings and his own imperfect understanding of the Old Runes. I have written the elder's words exactly as he said them to me.\n\n"In the Age of the Gods there was peace upon all the lands, and fire served man instead of killing him, and the light of the city of the gods, Germania, stood like a shining beacon at night through the beautiful magics of Valhalla. There was however, an angel who was not content with this peace, it was a spirit of madness and evil. The angel rallied about him legions of horrible demons to make war upon the gods of Valhalla. He was a tempter of men and angels alike, and was called the Father of Lies, for not even his own legions knew of his true goals. It was his fire that destroyed mankind, his warped pride that has smothered the light." I was greatly troubled by the Elder's words, but he counseled me with wise words.

The people of the desert, in ancient times so bitterly divided over land, resources, culture, and class, had at last begun to come together to create something entirely new.\n\nNot all was peaceful--bandits still roamed the sands, and the desert was as hot as ever--but the young nation survived. It spread across the deserts of what had once been called southern Arizona, creating a new language, new tools, and new artwork. An independent national identity emerged, for a fledgling young nation.\n\nThe greatest discovery of all was the ruins of a city, right underneath the sands. The people of the desert settled there, in the ruins, and resolved to rebuild it. They would keep building on the pattern of the old, until the city was greater than it had ever been in life. They would finish the great work their ancestors had spent their lives building, and create a new home for their new people.\n\nTo this task they applied themselves wholly, and for generations they labored, and their society grew. Using the tools left by those who came before, they learned once more of science, mathematics, art and beauty. The ash and dust that had once covered the city's streets and buildings slowly faded away, and eventually the lights and signs would once more illuminate the night skies of the desert. The people of the Sonora gazed upon their work with awe, and christened it with the name their ancestors had given it, named for a being that would always rise from the ashes of its death and begin anew. One day they would fall, they knew, but they also knew that life would rise from those ashes, and that was a comfort."

The ancient maps had all been long forgotten, and the stories their elders had passed down spoke only of great sadness and fear to the far east, across this seemingly endless sea. He had believed the stories when he was young, as all of the children did. But when he came of age, something changed inside of him. He wasn't content to fear the unknown, he didn't want to live in ignorance anymore. He would find the east, and see its supposed terrors for himself.\n\nAnd so the young man found himself a crew. It was not so difficult these days as it once had been; large ships and smaller canoes regularly ran along the coast, transporting goods, and many of their crews felt the same wanderlust he did. He searched for a time for a suitable ship, and in the end one was built with the aid of the local elders and the blessings of the holy men. And so they set off.\n\nTheir spirits were high at first. The wind was in their favor, and the mythical east was surely only a few days away. When a week passed and they saw no land, despair slowly began to creep into their hearts, but still they pressed on. They had to know what was out there, even if it killed them.\n\nA month passed, then another, and their food stores were beginning to wane. Some among the crew suggested turning back, even though they all knew they didn't have enough food for the journey that way either. And so they pressed on, though their stomachs ached and their throats grew dry.\n\nWhen all hope seemed lost, one of the sailors waited until the dead of night and crept his way to the bow, thinking that if only he threw himself off the ship, his misery would end much sooner. He had put his foot on the railing when his eyes widened, and he ran backwards, shouting "Land! Land! I see land!"\n\nBefore the boat could lay anchor on the coast of this new, strange place, canoes had already disembarked and brought the explorers to the green shores. And so, for perhaps the first time in years, the people of what was once the Americas would set foot on the soil of the former Old World."

And so, a strange tradition began to snake its way northward, from the distant deserts of what was once Mexico. At first, many survivors in the north feared the dead, telling their children stories of vengeful ghosts and ghouls that would steal them away in the night. Beware the dead, they would say, for their unbeating hearts are filled with jealousy for the living, and will gladly drag you down to hell with them.\n\nBut this strange new tradition said otherwise. It spoke of a day where the dead returned to Earth, but not to avenge themselves upon the living. No, the dead returned to view their descendants with gentle smiles upon their faces, to see the world's progress since the end.\n\nThe custom had many names. The oldest spoke of it as 'dia de los muertos', their children called it the Day of the Dead, and their children after them called it The Day the Dead Walked.\n\nRegardless of the name, the peculiar tradition spread throughout the north. Once a year, every year, the people would celebrate those that no longer walked the Earth with them, giving them food, offerings, and telling stories of their exploits: celebrating the lives they had, not mourning the deaths they suffered.\n\nWithin a matter of decades, every year on the anniversary of The War, the people of North America celebrated those who had perished so tragically in the flames.

A horror story told to children who refused to go to sleep all across former America, perhaps, but that didn't make it any less true, to the horror of any brave souls who dared to travel there. No one quite knew how it had started, but the fact remained that a local Warlord had on his person a cache of great and terrible weapons that was said to sear flesh from bone, slaughter hundreds at once, and more terrible things. But his greatest joy was a single weapon, which he called a "nook", that was said to incinerate cities in one single strike. Some said he was a warlock and could open portals to Hell itself, some said he was a brilliant scientist who had harnessed the power of the very Sun, but the eldest of Mountazhnia said the man was merely lucky, and had stumbled upon a treasure trove of weapons from an age long forgotten.\n\nThe fear of these weapons kept the people in line, and the terrible warlord took advantage of this, declaring himself the king of Mountazhnia, ruling with an iron fist. If any spoke out, or even showed the slightest dissent, their own villages would tear them apart out of fear of the King and his great weapons.\n\nAfter years of suffering and torment, finally, the dam broke. First one man stood outside of the King's fortress, rake in hand. Then another man joined him - and another. Eventually, hundreds - thousands stood outside the gate, waiting for their demise. But nothing happened.\n\nEmboldened, they stormed the fortress, and on that day, the "King" of Mountazhnia was brought down, his claims of unstoppable weapons proved false."

More intriguingly, structure appeared to carry several smaller structures resembling a metallic settlement upon its platforms, but the platform could not be reached without excessive effort and delay.\n\nAs the ship and her crew later arrive in port, they talk vividly of their discovery.

Yet they lacked the means to create such currency -- how, then, could one hope to radically shift the economy of their realm?\n\nMen find a way in time, as with all things. A system was devised consisting of three metals: copper, iron, and silver. Laborers worked day in and out, melting down the metals into moulds in which small, round discs are formed. For years the toils continued, with heaps of coins of all three stored in preparation for their debut.\n\nLong after the proclamation declaring these coins as legal tender, the kingdom soon found itself having become the nexus of the "Coinage Trade". Men became merchants day by day with the influx of wealth and goods across great distances which the trade had brought about.

It overlooked a valley, full of life and beauty, and there it watched, silently shading the land below from storms.\n\nPeople had lived in the mountain's shade for as long as there were people to call it home. The mountain had been called dozens of names over the centuries, as people were born and died, as rulers rose and fell, as civilizations came and went. The mountain silently watched it all.\n\nAs time went on, the villages did not fall, but they kept growing. They became small towns, then a single town. Then a city. Then a city-state in its own right. The people of the city grew rich in trade, and some of its inhabitants ventured inside the depths of the mountain in search of mineral wealth. People began climbing the mountain, living on it, driving past it, and flying over it. The mountain silently watched it all.\n\nOne day, the mountain was bathed in fire. The city in the valley was reduced to craters and empty husks. The few who survived fled to the mountain, hoping to find sanctuary that wasn't there. They succumbed, and their bleached bones were buried by wind and ash. The mountain silently watched it all.\n\nAs time passed, the scars of the earth were painted over. Grass began to grow in the valley, sickly, but grew it did. The husks rusted and collapsed, rain and mud filled in the craters, and the bones crumbled into dust. Sickly grass gave way to lush foliage and trees, and eventually it looked like no human had ever lived there.\n\nAnd then one day, a group of humans entered the valley and built a village."

Their great cities built on stolen land were consumed in a great conflagration. Many of the Mohawk also lost their lives in this terrible calamity; yet some held on. Not many. But enough. Enough to begin filling the land once more. Enough to keep necessary traditions alive.\n\nOne of the most valuable traditions was that of the Three Sisters. The growing of squash, corn, and climbing beans in rotating cycles. These crops work in harmony with one another. The maize provides a tall plant for the beans to climb up. The beans enrich the soil with nitrogen. The squash covers the ground to prevent sunlight from allowing weeds to grow, and further retains moisture in the soil and deters pests. These plants work in symbiosis with one another and combine their strengths to produce a bountiful harvest for the Mohawk nation.\n\nAnd so, with the land once more in the hands of its traditional stewards, it slowly began to flourish once more."

Long stretches of time have passed since the world ended, and the heroic actions of men before and during the terrible catastrophe are now enshrined as beloved myth.\n\nOne such myth began in the wastes of old Mehica. Law and order had collapsed as soon as innocent cities fell prey to the terrible bombs of empires long gone. Civilization collapsed in the chaos following the exchange, and with it the securities many have taken for granted. Those who survived were left to the tender mercies of cruel, evil men, who jumped at the chance to profit off of the battered land's misery.\n\nBut silver lines every gathering of stormy clouds, no matter the shade. Like knights come to rescue the beloved princess, heroes stepped up against the reign of chaos and anarchy that had gripped their homeland. Wearing colorful masks of blues, whites, and reds, these "luchadores" earned fame and the people's undying love as they battled banditos and thugs with the secret art of "La Lucha Libre".\n\nAsk an old abuelo and they will tell you of the luchadores' exploits with the excitement of children eight times their junior. Of how El Santo singlehandedly ended the Tres Marias with his legendary Slam-of-Choke. Of how Mil Mascaras defended Ciudad Rosas from rogue vaqueros by delivering devastating planchas from great heights. Of how the infamous Blue Demon, warlord of the Rio Norte, redeemed himself by forming a "tag team" with El Santo to defeat Comandante Anna, thus bringing lasting peace to all of Mehica. Tall tales, an outsider may say, but they swear to their family name: everything they said was real. They were sure of it.\n\nThrough action, man becomes legend; through the passing of time, legend becomes myth. Tales grow and shrink in size as they pass from generation to generation -- the feats of many may instead become the feats of one. But these men did indeed exist, if with exaggerated exploits to their names. Perhaps one day, the tall tales that have honored their exploits will spur men into action when Mehica calls for aid once more."

This was the state of things then, and so will it be the state of things tomorrow... at least, they thought it will. One disagreed.\n\nIt is said in the old chronicles that a man of will and charisma suddenly appeared in the courts and halls of the Great River realms. There he preached of peace and unity, appealed to the sensibilities of his hosts. Why must brother fight brother, peasant work and toil in fear of untoward reprisal, father bury his family wholesale? The path to prosperity, he proclaimed, lay not through fire and sword, but through hearth and spade.\n\nResponses varied from ruler to ruler. Some were seized with bursts of anger and ordered his arrest. Others refused to grant him entry, as word spread of his exploits. Few made show of entertaining his words; even fewer welcomed him with open arms. Those who did became subject to more visits from the enigmatic man, until finally they each received an invitation.\n\nHistory would tell us that from the meeting, its details lost to time, emerged an alliance of mighty and powerful nations that sought to establish order along the Great River. Their exploits in war became the matter of legend, as did the mercy of their rule in peace. Villages tasted safety for the first time, trade along the river's waters skyrocketed, and its old vagabonds and malcontents learned to live fear 'til the end of their days.\n\nThough its strength would rise and wane and disappear in cycles, this coalition will be held in great regard by the generations who grew under its aegis. For many their coming marked a seminal moment in mankind's long memory, where the New World finally pulled itself out from the ashes of the Old -- for wherever hoists the white torch of fable will be blessed with the chance to live free and prosper as the Ancients did."

So, the sea people died, or fled to the comfort of soil, as so many millions had before them.\n\nThere was one ship that did not have these problems. It had all the necessities to remain at sea: atoms for energy, steel for a strong hull, and manpower to take what they wished.

He had heard of these curiosities before, 'Treyns', they were called. Massive steel vessels that could supposedly carry hundreds and move with the speed of the wind. Fantastical nonsense, he always thought, but there it was; rusted to bits but still intact. He pressed his horse forward to get a closer look.\n\nThe wormlike-vehicle was extremely long, at least 300 paces, and its vast steel body was segmented into at least quint carriages. The Traveler had to see the head of this metallic beast, and perhaps divine what Gods must have built it.\n\nDismounting his horse, the Traveler entered the head carriage. The entire compartment was filled with dials and levers and gauges beyond counting. On the floor of the magnificent machine, lay the shattered skeleton of a man, rotted clothing still hanging from its bones. The Traveler knew, then, that there were no Gods. Not any more.

They became like a family, in every way but name. It seems that it was not fated to last, and so they all went their separate ways, scattering like leaves in the breeze. Some went to the graveyards of old, crumbling towers of rock and metal, haunted still by the ghostly outlines of the spirits that once resided within. Others found somewhere fertile, with green fields to spread their roots and bountiful forests to tame.\n\nIn time, these memories faded and were replaced by new traumas, turning what once had been amity to deep hostility in an renewed cycle of bloody revenge.\n\nIt had been many years, and the great scattering had become nothing more than a legend, aggrandized and modified to the whims of the tellers. Family ties were a myth between the bloodlines that now populated the valley known as the Olieoh. There was only war, and the land was filled with naught but cruelty and misery, as the blood of a warrior and the tears of a mother were shed as if they were the same. It seemed the entire valley would be stuck in the endless cycle, as man fought man and brother sought retribution for brother.\n\nThen came the Peacemaker, spreading with him hope and unity. He was aware that those who lived by the sword would die by it without fail, and that the only way to create something lasting was to do so without violence. The Peacemaker brought together the people of the valley, showing them what they were doing to one another. He showed them the fields in which they buried their dead, rows upon rows of the aftermath of mothers burying sons, who themselves had interred their fathers, who had most likely mourned lost brothers. As every village, every band of warriors saw what they had lost by choosing the spear, they found themselves agreeing with the message of peace.

Many scholars would argue against this, citing the uniform language across the river. One way or another, all agreed that these lands came to be dominated, for a considerable time, by men who called themselves vaqueros.\n\nThe vaqueros were men skilled in the handling of the surviving horses, a priceless means of transport. They were instantly recognizable from their wide brimmed hats and ornate ponchos, to keep the fallout dust at bay. Their primary job was herding surviving livestock, the sheep and cattle who had not perished in the calamity but had gone feral in the absence of their owners. After re-domesticating the beasts, the vaqueros would drive them across the wilds, in keeping with grazing seasons and to protect them from the marauders common in the post-calamity wilderness. Their meat and dairy were precious sustenance, sustaining not only the vaqueros' livelihoods but also the communities struggling to survive living off the sickly, irradiated lands.\n\nIn time the soil would grow fertile again, leading communities to grow and form something resembling a new civilization, with settled ranches and livestock breeding allowing the need for the vaqueros to fade.

The island paradise that we hoped to live out our days in peace upon turned out to be a fetid, tropical hell. The Japanese garrison were not welcoming of Americans, despite neither Japan nor America existing anymore, and our struggle was a long and bloody affair that lasted far too long.

The fury that rained down on the cities and towns of the land, purging them of life, saw fit to spare the small farm villages of this tribe, removing from their young the siren call of the modern world and allowing them to grow and expand into the open countryside at their leisure.\n\nThe Dukhobortsy, as they called themselves, spoke a language extremely foreign to any other spoken in this lands, even writing it in a foreign script that their neighbouring tribes could not begin to understand. Their ancestors taught them that they came to these lands from across the sea, fleeing a tyrant in the era before the Great Blinding. Their ways were nearly lost to them, the words of ancient chants bleeding away with each generation as ever more of their kin adapted to the customs of the more numerous tribes around them, abandoning the old way.\n\nThe blinding reversed this, sundering the tribes that once held sway over the Dukhobortsy and turning those tribes' own families to look at the spiritual warriors for salvation. The assimilated became the assimilators, and as foreign men and women adopted Dukhobortsy customs and took Dukhobortsy husbands and wives, new communes of this pacifistic, spiritual community began to spring up amidst the neighbouring plots of their older communities.

To some, their plunge into the water symbolizes their determination to outlive the winter, to brazenly face the cold and emerge alive again at season's end, just as they did from a frozen lake at season's beginning. To others, it is a foolhardy gesture of personal strength, proof that they are local to the region, and that their living here has given them the fortitude to survive this trial.\n\nFinally, to the most insane among those participating, it is an act of recreation. Some of these bizarre people insist that they participate in the plunge merely for fun, seeing neither historical nor symbolic significance in this semi-suicidal act of self harm. They are the ones who smile the widest when they emerge from the water, and who laugh and strike poses as their bodies are lost beneath the white waters beneath the ice, minutes away from death should their friends fail to save them.

His best bet was to hide down here, wait for the man to fall asleep, and then sneak out again once it was safe. As fate would have it, though, the homeowner was in quite a rush. Jesse heard loud footsteps moving across the house, as though the man was running. He wondered what the urgency could be, and then heard the footsteps get closer.

He'd found ways to keep the loan sharks off his back for quite awhile, spinning a different yarn to each one of them about how he'd pay them back soon enough. One he told he was close to having enough and would just need his next month's paycheck (he didn't have a job). To another he was about to accept a sizable inheritance (he didn't have any family). To a third, he offered a favor he never thought he'd have to conduct to earn himself some leniency. Every day he washed his hands an extra time to clean off the guilt of that favor.\n\nNow, though, Jack was out of favors. He was out of excuses. He was also still out of money. The loan sharks were all angling for a different one of his limbs, and Jack knew he'd have to skip town if he wanted to keep himself all in one piece. He was about to make his escape on the day the bombs dropped.\n\nIt all worked out quite well for Jack. When it all happened he had the good luck to be in his basement scrounging for some useful trinkets to pawn for cash before he took off. He stuck around in there for as long as he could before ascending into the post-nuclear wasteland above, finding it just safe enough to quickly make his way out of above ground. The thought occurred to him as he journeyed, suitcase in tow, that his loan sharks probably died along with the work. Them, and any trace of his debts along with them.\n\nHe was free.\n\nHe smirked, and decided not to leave town quite so quick. There still had to be something of use in all the wreck, and if the radiation hadn't killed him already, surely he had enough time to do a little bit of looting? Why not take just one more gamble.\n\n"

The hunt was on, and a prime prey had just presented itself: a large four-legged creature that he remembered his father had taught him was called a "Buck". He had his trusty bow already at his side and an arrow in the other hand, ready to be fitted and fired for the kill at any time. It would only take a few more steps to be in the optimal range, but even so, the experienced hunter took his time to avoid scaring his target. As he carefully moved into the final position, his foot caught on something, something heavy, and he fell ignominiously onto the hard ground. The Buck bolted.\n\nThe hunter grunted in agitation, then turned around to examine what had caused him to fail in his hunt. At first all he saw was the same leaf-covered canvas the rest of the ground appeared to be, but as he began to sift through the piles of now disturbed foliage, his hands found purchase on a most peculiar instrument. It was very oddly shaped, with what appeared to be a grip of some kind towards the back, a long tube extending outward from the front and a curved block of wood from behind. He had never seen anything like it before. Out of curiosity, he brought it up so that the block rested on his shoulder. It felt surprisingly natural, but the hunter still had his doubts about the odd object. In front of the handle was a curved lever of some kind. With some apprehension, the hunter pulled it back.\n\nAn explosion deafened his hearing as a force pushed his entire body backwards several feet. He stumbled and dropped to his knees, his limbs shook like plants in a storm. What was this contraption? He looked toward where he had pointed it, and his eyes widened in shock as he observed that in a tree that had been in the same direction, a smoking hole had appeared. It seemed that this unusual creation had some sort of power to destroy at a level even his bow couldn't match. But so what? It was clumsy, far too clumsy for a hunter of his skill. The noise it emitted had likely alerted all living creatures within the forest, and what use was a weapon that fought back when used? A most unhelpful tool indeed, it seemed to this veteran hunter."

It was only because he, Bishop Alexander Phillips, had made an old friend in the military from his days as young priest that they even had a warning at all. It was thanks to the selfless act of that now almost certainly dead man that he was able to evacuate his Sunday school program. And now, one of those children was missing.\n\nHe ran down the school's hallway as fast as his old legs would carry him, praying with each step that he would find the boy in time. Another student had told the Bishop that James had gone back for something. Was it worth dying over? Obviously not, but the boy was only six after all, nuclear war wasn't something someone his age would easily process. He had almost given up when he found the child, standing nervously in the doorway, seeming as lost and out of place as a frightened calf. He scooped the boy up and with a strength that burned his old body he dashed back the way he came.\n\nHe thought they would make it, it was only a little ways left. Then the ground trembled with a violence man was not meant to know. He saw the open door of the shelter, several children crowded around the opening.

Also unlikely.\n\nHis search continued to net him more oddities, more smothered fires. A further day of searching found him at the entrance of what he guessed to have been an automobile factory. As he opened the door tentatively, he held his gun up, ready for any lurking man or beast. The gun clattered to the floor, its owner forgetting all about it as he stood, mouth agape, at the last thing he would have expected.

Some had been lost to the heat and exhaustion, some to the pursuing slavers, and half a dozen had fallen during a scuffle with a gang of marauders they had chanced upon. Still, this forlorn, tattered group marched on, staking everything on a whisper of a rumor of a legend. A New Canaan. In the mines, the story had been passed down from the oldest man to the youngest little girl: a paradise of free slaves who were able to live together in freedom and harmony. A myth no doubt, but better to die in the pursuit of freedom than to go on surviving without actually living.\n\nStill, it couldn't be helped that, dream or not, the group was in a desperate situation.

In those six days, two of the group had passed from hunger, giving up their rations for the remaining children, a last act of heroic sacrifice.\n\nThe sign was dilapidated, only a few letters were visible, an 'S' here, a 'C' there, nothing more than those small clues. But it wasn't the sign that mattered; it was who was under it. Standing directly under the sign was a man, the gun in his hand pointing down to the ground passively.

Who could have been mad enough to actually unleash such a horror upon the world? The old sailor was known to his friends and family as a quiet and taciturn man, but if he could have gotten his hands on the fools who had rushed right past the precipice in an insane desire for national power, or retribution, or influence, or whatever other pathetic reasoning leaders of men invent to justify their actions, he wasn't sure he would be able to restrain himself.\n\nDid this mean that all of the men he saw die in the Pacific fell in vain? Did his brother's death in England all those years ago really count for nothing? He tried to search for some meaning in the madness as a second and then a third evil cloud appeared in the distance, but nothing came to him. No deeper meaning, no inherent truth or noble wisdom on the nature of man. All he felt in that moment was a deep despair; the despair of a man who believed that the great sacrifices he had seen and endured would ultimately make an impact.

In a marvelous display of the magic the Templemasters loved to fawn over, the object was able to contain a memory of a long dead Ancestor, and if this vessel really was from the time just before the Sundering, then it was possible that the voice of a man hundreds of years dead was about to be heard.\n\n"...as stated previously, as captain of this ship, I was given direct orders to fire my nuclear ordinance.

Nevertheless, I can not participate in this madness..."\n\nThat was all that could be recovered from the Black Box, perhaps the magic had waned in strength over the years. What confused the Aquisitioner was the reference to 'nukes', some type of spell possibly?

Even if he could not understand all of the message, it seemed to contradict the Temple's doctrine significantly. He would need to investigate further, and then what?

 RAD_NA.92.desc:0 "Ages ago, humankind fought an unending war with the very nature that it inhabited. The humans of the world in those ancient days would use and abuse the environment around them for their own depraved ends, caring nothing for the disastrous consequences their selfishness wrought-both for themselves, and for the other living, feeling beings around them. Mighty, verdant forests were cut down and burned to smolders, innocent animals of all kinds were tracked down to be savagely murdered, and great holes were carved out of the Earth by our simple-minded, primitive forebears, in a useless search for the worthless treasures they thought could be found beneath their feet. Evidently, whatever treasures they found were not enough to save them.\n\nThis age of war that scars our history was called 'civilization', and the Old Mothers tell us that it lasted hundreds of years, entire generations of humans living and dying only to be used as soldiers in the unscrupulous designs of the great foe that led humanity in that era: industrialists. The industrialists waged their campaign of civilization against the forces of nature with cruelty more extreme than any human alive could imagine; in the span of one lifetime, a landscape as far as the eye could see could be changed from a state of perfect equilibrium under the rule of nature, into a hellish nightscape of civilization. Where once stood a tranquil forest, all that would be left would be patches of grass, imprisoned and kept alive by their human masters as a symbol of status and prestige. So decadent were the industrialists that they would pride themselves on which of their kind could imprison the most nature, competing with each other over who could be most spiteful as to dementedly torture the greatest quantity of what was once undisturbed woods. Some of these sickening fiends would seek even greater perversions, turning nature itself into a tool of propagating civilization, perverting nature's gifts to sustain the disease of civilization. These most hedonistic and toxic acts went by a name that only the most brave among us deign to speak aloud: agriculture. The Old Mothers tell us that this unholy rite was what first brought our people away from the true path, and it is this depravity above all others that must never be repeated again.\n\nOf course, the effete and extravagant rule of the industrialists over humankind could not last. Their civilization system was too unstable and too dependent on the bounty earned by its conquest of nature to ever achieve the balance needed to last the ages. As civilization reached a critical mass, holding as its possession more of the Earth than was left for nature, the loot from further conquests became insufficient for civilization to sustain itself. The industrialists turned on each other, fighting with and sometimes even intentionally killing other humans over which method of conquering nature was most efficient, and how Earth's remaining riches ought to be divided. This infighting, the Old Mothers say, was the last act that ended the age of civilization. Using the weapons they fashioned for themselves from the hellish, arcane powers beneath the surface of Earth, they turned on each other and destroyed one another's industry, forgetting their common cause against nature and allowing the mother of Earth a reprieve from the industrialist banditry.\n\nMost of the humans who did not perish returned to nature, and would in the coming generations be educated by the wisdom of the Old Mothers. Teaching us to live off the land and to respect our fellow inhabitants of Earth, the Old Mothers brought us back from the brink of extinction, enabled by nature's grace to keep us alive. So great is nature's love for us that even after we would come as close as we could to slaying her, she could forgive us, and allow us to continue to hold a humble place in her great kingdom. Nature has given us mercy, the Old Mothers say, and we would be wise never to follow down the same path again that had once brought us so close to our end as a species. For, if we do, nature might not extend the gift of mercy a second time."

White gravestones gradually disappeared under the green and brown of the ground their graves had been dug into. Tombs collapsed, monuments fell, and slowly the cemetery became nothing besides an extension of the overgrowth of the once proud city.\n\nBut despite this, one last visitor made the rounds. At first he tried to halt the reclamation of the cemetery, but facing its great scope he slowly surrendered this battle. Instead, once a year, the lone visitor made a circuit of the graves, brushing his hands lightly over several, standing by some and laying flowers.\n\nFive decades after the fall, he made his last arrival. An old man, hunched over in age, an old military jacket faded from the constant onslaught of the sun. As the rain poured hard on the cemetary, the man made his way to the grave he always ended his journey on, sat down, and much like the inscription on the grave he faded away."

Not even the meanest Potato-serf would dare claim a lineage that did not extend back to at least Christ-Columbus. Should the Emperor himself walk into their village they would not deign to spit at his feet, so young and weak his mere centuries of family seem to those arrogant antiquarians.\n\nIt was in my journeys through the Kingdom of Roads as a humble translator of primitive American that I came across what at first seemed a perfectly reasonable town in Providence. It was small, near the coast and seemed to contain some very impressive albeit unusual examples of pre-Imperial architecture. The style, as you know, favours high, round windows and curves decorated with non-Euclidean geometries.\n\nThe people seemed amicable enough, though wary of strangers in a way that suggested not the cool fear of a typical Roader but the hot, sharp fear of a mangy dog who hears the twang of an arrow in the distance. It was only on my third night of staying in the inn, the Hateful Artist, wherein I realised what was so dreadfully off about the whole place. Every plum one of them was a mutant. From the meagrest six fingered child to the bent backed loping forms of what could have been a woman or a deer once, now not even a doctor could tell I should wager.\n\nSitting there, I felt a cold fear run down my spine. A fear of the other, of a wrongness I had never realised I could feel until that moment.\n\nSo if you dear reader, like me, has lived in fear all his life of the mob, of the mutant-finder, of the strangers cruel glare, then make your way to the little town of Providence, in the Kingdom of Roads."

Atop it's back was a high fin, gird by black rings, and from it's back their also arose a tentacle. This tentacle was stiff and seemingly as dead as the rest of it, yet when a priest approached praying to the Christ-Columbus, it turned with a shivering squeak to bring a solitary square eye to bear upon him.\n\nEchoing whispers emanated from the beast in some tongue know one knew, yet they felt had a certain familiarity. With that, the priest fell, dead of fright. The townsfolk ran, ran from the tentacular eye, ran from the almost-language of the whispers, ran from the great deep one.\n\nThe night a brave man of the town went to spy on the beast, so they should know its purpose, yet when he got there he was frozen in terror at what he saw. From a circular mouth atop its back, two figures came out. Dressed all in black and pale as snow, thinner than any man he had ever seen before and staggering like a mad cow. They spoke in the strange, almost-language, and moaned in pain at the slightest effort.\n\nThe man understood, these were deep men, who spoke the deep speech of the lost city of Atlantis. They had come as priests of their mad lord, the deep one.\n\nKnowing the land was cursed, the people left the beach and the town, never to return. In time the whole coast became a haunted land, where not even the Empire State dared go, and the deep one remained ever vigilant, ever watchful."

She and her pack prowled on horseback or in rusted up engines--whatever they could find and use to move around quickly. They rode through soft rains and radioactive fallout, responding to no man but their prophet: the Messiah, whose voice was so deep and resonant that their words always seemed to be in prayer. The savior of the broken Jagunços, the beaten indigenous, and the damned. Those damned whose ancestors were brought to the New World in chains before being broken by the dynasty supposedly granted their reign by God. The damned just like her. The Antichrist that came to govern this vast nation may have summoned the harbingers of the end, but now she had come to deliver them from him. She was the Counselor.\n\nThe Black Guard rode for years until they arrived at the gates of what was once known as the Imperial City. When the Counselor arrived, the inhabitants huddled themselves in dilapidated homes, starving and godless, in a spiritual exile. Cathedrals stood with no priests, universities with no teachers, and men with no faith in their hearts. Searching for masses to be fed, she found an ancient palace at the center of it all. In these halls she found relics of what was lost to evil in the centuries before. She knew that fate ordained her to wear the ancient crown. The tattered flag, kept still in the museum for over a century of poverty and suffering, would fly once more.\n\nHer crusade would only come to an end many decades later, when her resurrected empire stretched from the Imperial City to the Saints Bay. On her deathbed, she whispered her last words to her successor: rule for the independence and freedom of all. Never again would there ever be slaves. For, as shattered as the world had become, all would once again be made equal upon the return of our Lord. There was no doubt that in the silent air, an immense archangel carried the Counselor into heaven above the city reborn."

At first, the outsider faced distrust from the indigenous community but he quickly proved himself capable when he showcased certain new techniques to the tribe. He had brought with him a vast array of inventive arts and knowledge-words that intrigued the tribal leaders enough to keep him around. The fact he had managed to ingrain himself into the culture of the tribe, whilst teaching them of these newfound tactics, was nothing short of a miracle. Yet he was said by some to be a man of miracles. Some of the more mystical Elders whispered he was a gift for the tribe from a higher power. Whatever he was, he was certainly useful now that the jungle had become home to various hostile outsiders who wished the tribe harm.\n\n"The work of a fighter never stops until the enemy lets up." said the Comandante to the youngsters that had huddled around him..."Your work is a protracted one and it is through your work that you will become known as a guerrilla. You will come to understand this term as we progress in your training. For now, I will demonstrate basic combat movements. Now... watch closely."\n\nThe young men and women were transfixed by Enríquez and his workings. He was effortless in his workings and described clearly and plainly what he wished from the youth. Maybe he was a gift after all - he had given this once isolated community a chance of survival in this ever-changing world. One could only wonder about his motivations, but the tribe was grateful anyhow. Was it not said that the weak took what help they were offered?

The people native to these lands were sparse, their populations disunited and split apart across various settlements, some at great distances from their fellows. Despite the sparsity of their settlement in the region, it had been their home for millennia. Since the early days of the old world this had remained unchanged.\n\nUntil, that is, the new world laid claim to their home.\n\nVast populations of a previously unknown people flooded into the fertile coastal lands in search of a new home - and a new home was what they found. They arrived in such numbers that they quickly came to dwarf the local population. Simply referred to as "The Outsiders" by the locals, their strange culture rapidly hold of the lands. Within a brief matter of time, entire cities had been established by these people, as the vast fertile lands began to be cultivated by their farmers.\n\nWithin the blink of an eye, a civilization all but alien to the locals had popped into existence. Yet as this civilization of the new world rose, so too did their own fall."

Much had been lost, but all had a chance to begin again, and new societies and cultures would rise in the ashes of the old lands. Innovations were reclaimed or reconceived, art and commerce flourished, and empires would rise. And when the people were once more sufficiently numerous, Pestilence would resume his walk amongst them.\n\nIt would begin in the southern jungles. Men would fall sick and feverish, dying horribly days later from open lesions that would not cease bleeding no matter what. By the time those further up the trade route heard the terrible tales, they too would already have fallen ill. Before anyone realized what was happening, the disease spread far and wide. People lay dying in their homes, at their businesses, in the streets. Even Nihon and the distant Indus did not escape the wrath of the plague, burning through urban and rural climes, through rich and poor alike. It would come to be known as the Red Silence, and to all the nations it was as if the world was coming undone once again.\n\nAnd just as quickly as it came, the Silence would fade away. The dead would be given their due respects where possible, and once more society would rebuild. And this time the destruction was not absolute, for disease can kill a nation's populace but it might leave untouched the nation's institutions. For a time, food would be numerous, wealth would be redistributed, and even the common serf would find himself time to stop, sit and consider his place in the world. And in its contemplation, man would bring forth a new era of thinking. A new wealth of ideas, innovations, and beliefs would invigorate every layer of society. A time of renewal. Of regrowth.\n\nA rebirth."

With nothing but the clothes on his person and the sack on his back, he ventured a great distance along winding paths of stone -- just as the elder instructed.\n\nLam-ang's tribe was one of many hundreds scattered across the Seven Thousand Isles. They had their own memories that run far before the day Kaptan had struck the Old World in His righteous anger. As the blue sky flashed orange and thunder clapped where there were no clouds, searing heat torched the barriers that had kept old grudges at bay. Countless moons had passed since the Kamatayan brought the past to an end, yet the peoples that now live atop its corpse seemed insistent on bringing its dead conflicts with them.\n\nWith the need to wage war comes the need for food and weapons, and with the need for food and weapons comes the need for strong men. For Lam-ang's tribe, only the strongest would suffice, and so the elder decreed: any boy who wishes to become a man must first journey to the Karaang Gubat and retrieve a relic of the elder's choosing. Only when he returns with it will the elder acknowledge him as a man of the tribe. Lam-ang was tasked to find a banner of blue and red, with yellow stars on a field of white.\n\nEventually, after traversing hills and streams and dense brush, he finally found the Matandang Gubat. None of the songs prepared Lam-ang for the sight before him: what he thought was an old village was instead tall pillars of stone and metal as far as the eye can see. Brushing aside the last vestiges of fear and doubt, the boy began the arduous task of finding the proof of his manhood among the ruins his ancestors had left behind."

The Old Man is grouchy in the manner of all convalescent elderly, but there is work to be done: the tea-stand must be set up, the leaves and water boiled to the right temperature, the banner unfurled.\n\nWhen the young girl is bored with the Old Man's calls to clean this or that, she sneaks off, as she is wont to do, into the woods. Once or twice she has found great silvery rust-red machines in the wilderness, with faded insignia on them in blood-red and white. But what they were meant to build or destroy she cannot tell. Today she finds nothing, so she heads to a clearing on the edge of a hill: there she has found something new to watch.\n\nThere is a great space in the plain below, and on it lies a tangle of twisted white and grey stone and metal stretching in all directions, rectangular and messy. Traces of jagged stone still show in places in the ruins, and the roads still retain their blackness. In the skyline there are one or two jagged fingers, and the girl likes to imagine that she is there, in the fingers' vast spaces, touching the sky and flying in the great-wings the Old Man tells her about when he is drunk. But the plain of scrambled-wreckage never comes to life, and she heads home at dusk. Whatever this once was, it is dead as picked-clean bones now.\n\nShe passes a road sign as she returns on the broken road, fingers the sign's strange pattern, and wonders what Y K HAM 25 KM means. Perhaps the Gods meant it to be a ritual, or perhaps a magic phrase? She shrugs and continues on her way. It is none of her business, and the hearthfire of home awaits - there is nothing for her here."

The monks whispered that the creatures on the other side of the sea had barely been human in the first place - what was the point of trading with near-animals?\n\nHe settled upon the creative use of mythology to persuade the Lordship of the expedition's importance. With the merchants he had agreed to pool funds with, Miyazaka and Mitsu, the young merchant appeared at the Province Court with a set of very expensive scrolls. All were pre-War, and all were written in the strange flowing set of characters whose interpretation had been lost to time. Some suspected it had something to do with the strange shapings of names in the tongues of the land, and how some namings with the same meanings were said in entirely different ways in court or marketplace. This was Ishiguro's lead: the Lordship was many things, but above all he was curious.\n\nThe Lordship listened patiently to the merchants' promise to return not just with wealth, but with the keys to understanding where the Forgotten Words had come from - and the power that came with reclaiming forgotten names. He agreed to fund the provisioning and the armaments for a convoy of five ships, to be sent to the lands beyond the Southern Diamond.\n\nMonths passed. Ishiguro now sat on the deck, watching the emerald landline in the distance grow ever closer. Details magnified and clarified, and became rivers and mountains and the sparkle of life. Ishiguro prepared the scrolls of calligraphy, a few trade goods from the sculpting and crafting centres of the Central Island, and set off with a few soldiers of the Guard on a little boat, to the shores of the Land of Blood and Gold.

Iron horses that rode under the power of steam, great steel birds that could carry men to the skies, hulks of copper wiring that could be tricked into thinking - sufficiently comprehensible magic slowly parsed themselves back into technological theory, and then into reassuring fact, after countless generations of ignorance.\n\nIt was in the bay of Narasakai that the men of the New World discovered once more the methods of breaking apart the most fundamental building blocks of the universe, and wielding the unimaginable energy contained within. The mood of the men of the great institute was ecstatic as their Divine Heart came alive, its essence sustained by a carefully choreographed disintegration of the elements. The power contained within was comparable to that of the gods, enough to sustain the entire realm perhaps, enough to usher in a new golden era of peace, knowledge and progress for a thousand years and more.\n\nAs the men cheered, an almost imperceptible chill came over one of the researchers. An ancient, unbidden ancestral memory of a power that promised peace but brought only suffering unto untold ages. The man shuddered at the implication of the power that mortals had now been granted. Could men be trusted with the power of divinity? Did they even deserve it? And even if they did, would they use it wisely?\n\nAnd yet where there was fear, there remained great hope. Hope for not just the islands that were their home, but for every man, woman and child of the earth. If one Heart could be made, then others would surely follow, and the world would awaken to an age without want or scarcity.

One step, then another, and another, an eternal march to an unknown salvation. Not for him, but for the Boy, cradled by the Old Man's fragile frame against the uncaring elements. The Boy's parents died so that the Boy might live, even if the body of an invalid was all that remained to honor the parents' last wish: the boy must reach the other side of the mountain, through an endless, freezing climb, while seeing nothing but blurs through a wall of snow and hail.\n\nThe Old Man wore many layers, but the inexorable cold penetrated through all of them, seeping so deeply into his bones such that any sense of touch became dulled and distant.

They told of godly tools that could hold a river back and create light from dark, and move a ship without the use of sails.\n\nXue was an inquisitive boy. When his friends turned their back to go play with junk and his parents went off to work in the fields, Xue would ply travelers for their stories until they finally broke and spilled their tales. Often, they would be mundane. A friend they knew disappeared in the sea to the east, or they knew someone who knew someone who had seen terrible things in the old palaces. The usual old stuff. Occasionally, however, Xue would hear someone talk of the west, and of the empires unknown, and of men with five eyes and four fingers.

What lay beyond the hills, to the west?\n\nOne particular day, a traveler came from a direction Xue had never seen a traveler come from. Over the mountains and the wall, from the west. His skin was dark, like he had rubbed charcoal over himself. His clothes were tattered. In a broken Putonghua, Xue gathered that he had been separated from a caravan. He brought the man back to his family's cottage, where his family took him in, feeding him until his cheeks were no longer hollow and mending his strange clothes. As he rested, Xue began asking him a torrent of questions. Where was he from, who did he travel with, and what laid in the west? The man gave simple answers. He came from a great desert, over the mountains and on a road thousands of li long. Xue was fascinated, and the man was happy to oblige him.\n\nEventually, of course, the man had to leave. Xue begged and pleaded with his parents to let him go with him, but they needed their son on the field. When the time came for him to leave, Xue snuck out of the house and followed him down the side of the trail, hiding in the trees. When he was far away enough from the house, he made his presence known. The traveler was not surprised; adolescence had instilled foolish actions in him, too, when he was Xue's age. Nevertheless, he was not one to turn down such a boy, and let him follow along. The father awoke that morning see his son's bed empty. He knew where Xue had gone, and the family mourned. Even if he was not dead, he was as well as such.\n\nThe boy, on the long road over the mountains, witnessed palaces of the gods of an unimaginable size. Each new town and each caravan held stories teeming with life. He could not travel to every place, but at least he could hear of them and their people, the horizons offering a clue of what lay over."

At the time, Captain Akihiro Hashimoto had received his orders with only the greatest reluctance and hesitation, but in the end did his sworn duty.\n\nNow he looked out over a cove, at the center of which his former command was grounded, waves gently caressing her steel hull in the early morning light. This was to be its final resting place: an obscure southern island chosen for both its large size and lack of toxic pollution.\n\nHashimoto observed closely from his elevated vantage point as the work took place. People - 112 from his complement, plus the 41 rescued from an adrift freighter they had come across during their months roaming the sea - were being ferried ashore on small liferafts. Following them would be supplies, and eventually material. Already a party was being organized to search the jungle that lay beyond the beach for a place to settle and any other inhabitants, whether they be natives or the remains of an outpost.\n\nBefore that, however, Hashimoto knew there was something he must do. Turning his back to the cove, he approached a small ditch he had finished digging minutes earlier. Stacked haphazardly from the bottom were dozens of flags and shoulder patches, all emblazoned with the Rising Sun. Thoughts swirled in his mind -- thoughts of his family, his home, his comrades, his friends -- as he stared at the pit. All of them were almost certainly gone by now, scattered to the winds like the nation he had once served.\n\nSomberly, Hashimoto gave one final salute, then struck a match and dropped it into the ditch. Flames ate greedily at the gasoline-soaked cloth, and in an instant the dozens of little suns were consumed by scorching heat. He stared, silent, into the fire for several seconds more; then, slowly, he picked up the shovel and gasoline canister he had used and made his way back down to the beach."

Meditating-\n\nA single small bit of laughter cuts the old man off from his trance, and he turns from his duty to the rest of the field. Children from the village run around playing with sticks and jokingly barking orders at each other. Waving around 'swords' with their imaginations, acting dramatic and fighting amongst each other. A 'game'. A war game. There was a time when he was younger he would have thought of it as such a thing. Waving around swords, barking out orders- For a moment, he is caught up in the past once again. Caught up in the noise of screams and explosions, caught up in the smells of smoke and flame, caught up in the colors of soot and blood. The old man pauses for a moment, water filling his eyes before he removes it.\n\nTwo steps towards the children before they pause their play. Many are already aware of his eccentricities. However, he does not berate or scream or roar. Instead, he points to his own sword.\n\n"Hold it like this. Your stance. Like this." He begins, as he holds his own blade with one hand and points to stick with the other. It is no longer a game. Hours pass. Stick meets stick. Slashes, parries, a few small cuts. The children are learning. Good.\n\nThe old soldier gives the first smile he has given in a long time, and with the setting sun to his back recites a single phrase from memory."

He had also refused to take them. Even now, as bombers moved above in the skies, as ships strafed and fired, he refused to fight.\n\nHe was headed home. For if the world truly was at its end, if the men in higher stations had decided to throw the world away, then was blind obedience truly what mattered? He had a wife. A son. Two people he had barely made time for, two people he had moved aside in adherence to duty, honor, and all of the things he had been told made him perfect. Made him a man. And now, they were going to die because the cause he had fought for, bled for, had sent men to die for...\n\nWas all for nothing. All of it was for nothing. All the jingoism, all the horrors he had perpetrated in the name of peace, all the young men he had shouted at and beaten and berated until they became good soldiers- nothing.\n\nFor a moment, the deserter composed himself as he stood at the doorway to his house. For an hour, he consoled his wife and told her everything that was to come. For two hours, he and his son played and chatted and told stories.\n\nHalfway through the fourth hour of his time at home, he saw a single bright and blinding flash out of the corner of his eye and held his wife and child as close to him as he could.\n\nThe end came."

Ever since the raiders had left him at the monastery gates they were the whole world to him, he never left and he hoped he would never leave.\n\nSome men didn't, they stayed in the monastery, farming and meditating on the holy texts until they died and were thrown outside for the sky to take. But Chaag was a good boy, he knew his place. Every month a man had to join the raiders and in return they left the baby boys. It was the nature of things, the way the world worked.\n\nWhere did the tributes go? No one knew. Some said they were eaten by the savages. Some said they were offered up to the sky god and his burning demons. Others said they were just let loose, made to walk the steppe-wastes until the ghosts found them, or worse, the Russians.\n\nBefore he left the monastery, the elders shaved him and washed him, wrapping him in a clean robe.

A lump the size of a dumpling had formed on her neck, making it hard to eat, but fortunately there was no shortage of people to help her chew.\n\nBack when Nagasaki was not a memory and Japan was more than a myth, she remembered the fear. The fear that one day there would be an agent from the Emperor, one smart enough to see through the metaphors and symbolism. On Ikitsuki they worshiped one God, and he did not need a palace on Earth to live in. For years they had hidden it behind a great fortress of mystery and misdirection, but no longer. Now, at the end of the world, they are free.\n\nThey approach the island now, a spire she did not remember appears first, bright and beautiful.

A promise of heaven on Earth, where God would banish the sinful and bring the holy to heaven.\n\nWell, it was a queer sort of heaven, but it was better than anything Jun had ever dreamt of as a girl. Yes there was pain, but there was such wonders to be found in helping, in serving your fellow children of God.\n\nA bleak paradise it may be, but a paradise it still is."

I'd play with my brothers across the spaces of our cramped village square, and our giggles lit up the drab grey stones of the parade-square tiles. Now it's just Ling and I, playing in the night, so very far away from my home - and so very near to death.\n\nLing laughs, her face a pattern of shades and brightness. I feel the sudden, unaccountable urge to kiss her, and so I do. Her lips are tart, with a hint of bitterness - lipstick, perhaps. Now she pulls me away from her face gently, like she's back at her father's pottery-shop moving vases, and she whispers, her face cast in serious lines. "Are you sure your friends from the Army will mind?" I nod, smiling. It makes very little difference now. The Kwangtung Army, as of the first launch of tactical missiles from bases in Harbin, has ceased to exist as a functioning force. My friends, if they are lucky, have already melted into the struggling transports back to Kyushu. Those who are not...\n\nI do not consider myself one of the unlucky ones. My family, if they are not already dead, will surely join the Spirits soon. I have not seen them in years - the love that seemed most real to me was shrouded in the smiles and the warm gestures of the girl who found me in Shanghai all those years ago. She is a proud woman now, although we never married. I sometimes regret it.\n\nEven so, what we have is beautiful. Fireflies live lives brief and tender as spring-flowers, but still they dance. I hear the dull whistle of something roaring into the sky, towards the forests ahead of us. I whisper the old poem: "My life/Came from dew/And melts like dew./All of Naniwa/Is dream after dream." And I pull Ling close once more, facing the new dawn for her, as the sun touches down in the forests of Liaoning."

Thousands of men and women -- some dressed in fine silk, others with naught but bare chest and leggings -- trained their eyes onto a regal figure sat on a worn throne. A smaller figure, no less dressed, kneeled in front of him with his head bowed.\n\nBehind them, and in front of the host, rested a lumbering behemoth of steel. It stretched the span of a dozenfold horses, separated into sections tethered to one another by large nails. Trophies and writing adorned its well-oiled sides: tattered banners of defeated, curses in their native tongue, the names of fallen warriors and the honored dead, skulls and bones strung together with cords of hemp. Old men in the robes of monks scatter wisps of incense throughout its length, chanting mantras to their ancestors and gods. None dared to interrupt them as they performed their sacred functions.\n\nThese lands were not spared by the flames of the Purification, yet the steeds of steel with which its peoples built their great cities, and the tracks which these traveled, miraculously remain. Capable of carrying a thousand men across a hundred leagues in speeds faster than any horse, they became the prized possessions of great warlords who now roam the dry plains. Owning one such steed was an honor reserved only to the strongest of K'uan-dong, who had acquired them through many wars spread across many years.\n\nThe monks had completed their rituals when the old warlord rose up, beckoning the knelt man to come closer. Words were exchanged in the tongue of nomads.

Stray roots remained at the bottom, rough with pebbles and stones of gravel -- a poorly-made ditch, all things considered. He sighed to himself. It will have to do. He glanced at the body beside his feet. The dead eyes of an old man in a faded olive uniform stared back at him.\n\nThe General was there when the bombs dropped, they said, years before Mama brought him to the world. Quick on his feet, he gathered what was left of the army to the mountainsides while China burned to the ground. Many lost hope, but the General was there to raise their spirits back up. The War of Resistance will continue, he liked to say, just as it had continued even after the death of Chairman Mao.\n\nChina's wilderness disagreed, however. The elements beat upon the ranks like a slavemaster's cruel whip, dragging weakened men with them as the days and months pass. Starvation dealt a second blow, for there was nothing to forage in the harsh hinterlands. An army dwindled into a thousand, then a thousand into a hundred. Eventually, only he and a handful of guards remained by the General's side.\n\nHis final moments remained like a clear film reel on the back of Li Chuang's mind. Shaky hands gently shoving a worn, bloody copy of the Little Red Book onto his chest. Bloodshot eyes filled with tears, struggling to hold his gaze. "Protect the revolution, Hong Xiaogui," he whispered, before his figure stilled one last time. So died the last general of the New Fourth Army.\n\nLi Chuang never truly met Mama before. All he remembered of her were vague noises and the blurry face of a young woman -- his first clear memory was the General teaching him how to write Mandarin. So died then, alone but for Li Chuang holding him upright, the father he never had.\n\nBlinking away tears and breathing deep, the little red devil tended to his filial duties. He gently laid his father onto the poor grave, soiling his trousers with the earth he had dug. Claps resounded in the forest, heard by none but its creatures. The last of their paper yuan, now useless, burned and rose above the canopy. As the General left his war on Earth to rest with his ancestors, his son left their cruel abode and never looked back."

He wore a simple roughspun tunic, worn but well-kept. Never a day goes by without him haggling prices down for some trotters. Old Feng knew about his problems back home, especially the bottle of cheap drink he carries with him all the time, so he always gave in.\n\nNext was Little Li, one of the guards manning the city wall. He always enters with the politeness of a respectful young man, with the right amount of money to buy shoulder and belly, his favorites. They talk about the silly yellow uniform he wears with him, probably acquired from some old ruins, but Old Feng never was one for gossip.

He wears silk and enters his shop without saying a word, with meek steps and a hunched back. The butcher never really understood him when he does speak -- his tongue was similar, yet at the same time different, like the difference between offal and rind. He always pays for tenderloin, no giving back change, and leaves without causing a ruckus, back to a house filled with many books.

They had built grand estates on terraced rice farms and established a strict caste structure. At the top were the Black Yi, the revered nobility of the Southwest. Beneath them were the White Yi, men who were free, yet common. At the bottom of this structure were the slaves. These unfortunate souls were once foreigners, kidnapped and forced to till the soil for generations. Sweat coated their brows and whips broke their backs, all while the Black Yi would sit in their manors, chattering to each other over tea and dim sum.\n\nYet, when pillars of smoke smothered the sky and men melted to ash, those few left alive in the Southwest had no choice but to huddle together in the manors for shelter. The Black Yi had to till what was left of their fields themselves. All surviving hands were needed in the new world. No one needed the whip to work; the fear of natural death was enough to drive them forward. Everyone left was able to eat their simple meals communally in the old manors, and bunked in them too.\n\nFor generation after generation, this was their way of life. Over time, the people slowly began to forget which among them was once a Black Yi or a White Yi or a slave. After even more time passed, they struggled to remember what "Black Yi" or "White Yi" even meant. Everything the survivors had on their farms was shared in common, and human beings were not among the shared property.\n\nOne thing they never forgot, however, was that the Southwest belongs to the Yi. To those who called it home, however, a Yi was anyone who was willing to work. A Yi was anyone who would share the fruits of his labors with his fellows. A Yi was anyone who devoted himself to the freedom and survival of those around him. Finally, a Yi was someone who helped make the Southwest a home for all his brothers, and would protect that home forevermore."

What he said likely held little weight, and none would have granted him even a moment of their time - at least, if it weren't for the army at his back.\n\nThe conqueror swept through the lands of the far east, taking hold of vast swathes of loosely controlled territory through sheer force of numbers and sudden, lightning-fast strikes. The unprepared kingdoms and settlements of that land could do naught but surrender, or retreat in the face of an unstoppable foe. Yet it was the seemingly unstoppable nature of this invading force that would be its undoing. Despite the unending petty squabbles between the nations of the east, they were faced with an existential crisis. Their choice was plain to see: temporarily end their rivalries, or face certain subjugation.\n\nOver the months, a grand coalition slowly formed in the face of the conqueror, as every move became ever more difficult for him - ever more a risk. He elected to quash the coalition by delivering to them a decisive defeat, and thus set forth to conquer one last time. Amassing a grand army from all of his subject peoples and nations, he marched to meet the still-forming coalition in preemptive combat.\n\nThe battle promised to be legendary; thousands of men readied themselves to face the enemy, as generals huddled in tents, carefully planning their strategies and tactics for the coming struggle. Yet, as the battle came to action, little of that planning would be put to use. The conqueror was swept off his horse by a conveniently placed arrow, perishing upon the field of battle before the first shields had even clashed.

Both burn easily in nuclear hellfire, which was what purportedly happened to the fourteenth of this sacred line. No one precisely knew of the circumstances involved, and no one dared to pry. What mattered most was that the Roof of the World had suddenly lost its guide; should this state persist in these uncertain times, the structure as a whole becomes more prone to collapse.\n\nWith the current chaos, assembling the High Lamas on the direction their search shall take is an exercise in futility.

Even though news of disasters and war kept coming in, this was a new opportunity to start his admittedly uninteresting life once again. He settled in the house, and while he was in the kitchen...\n\nBlinding light filled the room, just like yesterday. But before he could turn to look what had happened, Zhang faded away as he turned to ash by another nuclear explosion."

It's rulers derived power from the pomp and expense of the plays they performed in. The very government was, in essence, a performance. Each vote was scripted and rehearsed before being presented to a lucky crowd. Rituals consumed every moment of the elite's life. They were left no time to care for the concerns of their subservient or of administrative matters. The act was eternal, the theater the very essence of life. When a great epidemic swept through the land, the stage only gained more pomp, the costumes more jewels, the actors far more dramatic. The gods must reward them for more.\n\nEach elite was consumed more and more with the great ritual of writing, memorizing, and performing a script. Each was drilled into their heads. When there were no longer residents to draw tribute from, they let earthly matters become irrelevant. They simply stopped feeding themselves. In time, the great stage would go quiet."

The world seemed to be collapsing at his feet. His great victory in the east had been hampered by the announcement of the Westerners that the world had an end. That end was to happen any second. So Zongwu sat in his chair and prayed to the ancestors. In the last moments of his life, he hoped for ultimate salvation. What else was there to pray for?\n\nIn the last moment of his life, he had a vision of Dao. His heart filled with joy, and in that moment he fell into a deep sleep. His aides rushed to meet his needs and put him to rest, but the great fires were moving too fast. In a moment, the cloud had swept him into heaven. The corpses of commoners may be found lying across the old cities, but the corpse of Old Leader Gao is said to lie in the heavens, undisturbed and peaceful."

Yet, nothing could have prepared the inhabitants for the utter destruction that the final war would bring upon them. Whole cities reduced to rubble and hundreds of millions of lives extinguished in an instant. To those who survived, the world they now inhabited was so accursed they almost wished they had perished.\n\nMany would make a great trek west. They had heard that in the farther flung reaches of the Middle Kingdom, there were cities and societies that had been left untouched by the great bombs. Pilgrims would regularly pack their things and make a perilous journey westward, crossing imposing mountains and mighty rivers in search of a new home. Some would give up and settle at various points along the great river. Some would make it to the intact ruins of abandoned cities and rebuild anew. And along the way, pilgrims would trade with those who had given up further behind, in the hopes of one day helping those who would one day venture where they feared to tread.\n\nThe ancients had referred to a similar route to the West as the 'Seelk Road'; though none knew what 'seelk' signified, the name itself remained as a new trail of outposts flickered into life on the ashes of a long-forgotten past."

They thought that the being or beings they gave praise to here would make their lives easier, would protect them from harm, or perhaps would simply grant them a new life after their current one ended. They were wrong, and the destruction they brought upon themselves serves as proof.\n\nThere is no god. The people living here in this temple know that fact now. They know that the world is bleak and capricious, and that life is entirely meaningless. They know, and they refuse to let it get to them. They refuse to wallow in sorrow simply because there is no ghost in the sky looking out for them. They are wise, and they understand that the end of the world did not come from a cosmic plan. Rather, it came from bad decisions by stupid men. Bad, stupid decisions that they would never repeat.\n\nThey had purpose now. They travel out from their homes each month, in search of another altar to a god that never existed, to use it not for worship, but for shelter. When the month was up, they would destroy it; knock down whatever kept it standing and watch it crumble and fall. They had been going at it for so many years now. So many temples torn down, so much of past ignorance destroyed. They would keep on going until nothing was left, until nothing remained of these monuments to the sort of idiocy that ended the world. Maybe when all the temples were gone, the suffering brought on to the world by faith would stop punishing humanity for its superstition. Until then, it was time to be on the move again."

When these scraps are sufficient for the powerless and destitute to sustain themselves, or when they are fooled into believing they hold power and that their master is their friend, they will remain calm and peaceable. But when a poor man's stomach tells him that he is starving, and his nose tells him that the rich man above him has food, hell hath no fury.\n\nSo many millions--billions, maybe--had died. So many more were blind or bedridden, reliant on whatever living friends and relations they might have left to help keep them alive. The 'war', if it could be called that, had ended so quickly, and yet its ramifications would be felt for thousands of generations. There had never been a worse calamity to befall mankind. To all those weakened by hunger, whose every loved one was dying of the same, things that might otherwise have been unthinkable to them became sensible and rational in this new order of things. The nuclear apocalypse had muted their sense of morality, and mutated their relationship to dynamics of power. Specifically, they no longer respected the men who had it, the men who had caused this, and they did not care if they lived or died to take what they needed. If they didn't receive it they would die anyway.\n\nThe local administrator wasn't actually Chinese. He was a Japanese man, a settler, who moved over to run this quarter of the country with his extended family, after China's subjugation. Some people had spread rumours he was hoarding food in his estate out in the country, and a few hundred men had arrived at his gates to investigate those rumours. Things got rowdy. The guards shot first, and then things went downhill from there. The walls were climbed over, the gates opened, the crowd stirred up by the hostilities of the men who resisted them. Some people swore they smelled food. What happened when the riot arrived at the front door of the house could not be described as anything more than a massacre. A few bags of rice were found, and ripped open and fought over, but they wouldn't sustain very many lives for very long. Meat, though, was the most ultimate of luxuries in these times, and there was plenty of meat to be found inside the estate. When a poor man's stomach tells him that he is starving, and the world around him tells him that morality doesn't exist any more, the denizens of hell would balk at the sight of what he would do."

Yet the demoralized soldiers of Bashu State surrendered to the last, refusing warlord Shi Qi's desperate pleas to fight to the end. The battle for the City of Ashes, once a stronghold of a long-forgotten regime that had ruled Jiuzhou, has ended.\n\nWhile his troops celebrated their great triumph and spent their spoils of war on drink and wench, Gao Guanlin climbed Simian Mountain. The night's canopy had already blanketed the sky, its starry spots gleaming bright. Across all of Jiuzhou, from the banks of the Pearl River to the Great Wall, the souls of many warlords and their men burned with blazing light -- just like the stars in the endless void above.\n\nBut Jiuzhou was no mere void, one of many that now dot a world ruined by old fires. Jiuzhou was civilization itself, birthed in the fertile soil of Zhongyuan, forged through a thousand thousand years of monumental pain and anguish and triumph. The bond of this eternal struggle and the rule of Emperors created something far different from the concept of "nation". Gao Guanlin was not a philosopher or a historian, but one thing he was certain: The very concept, the very word known as "Jiuzhou" told of an idea greater than any cause, race, tongue, faith, or man.\n\nThe warlord turned to the east from Simian Mountain's peak. On his way alongside Yangzhe River was a "Xiang River United Army", the host of yet another powerful warlord. To the north his scouts report his ally Dong Junfa being assailed by Xie Dongsheng. Gao Guanlin can send part of his army to assist him, but will leave his rear guard vulnerable to incursions by Hou Yong. He sighed. Even after victory, hard decisions remain.\n\nBut the warlord had made peace with himself long ago. He might fall to poison, age, betrayals, or battles... they did not matter. In the end, Jiuzhou will be made whole once more -- either with him at the helm, or with him left forgotten in a shallow grave."

With divine rage he drew his sword, but her guards used dark trickery to slay him where he stood.\n\nEnraged by this, a champion of the mad dog challenged the Queen to a duel of honor, yet so cowardly was her court that only a humble farmer who had followed them for seven days agreed to fight him.\n\nSurrounded by trees, the farmer and the knight fought, one with steel and skill while the other was clad in sack-cloth with a wooden cane. You may ask, dear listener, who would win? But you, like the champion, did not know the secret power of the farmer, for he was an ally of the forest, and at his words it sprang to life.

Sultans and princes raised banners old and tattered in the service of a vanished dream - but the precise contours of that dream had been lost in the harsh dawn of the Burning. One story, as intense and bitter as a bad dream, was preserved. Songstresses and silk-weavers whispered and retold, whispered and retold, whispered - and retold. And so the dream came to life, becoming a popular myth-legend spread in the same folk-theatre circles as the Mahabharata and the Red Plays.\n\nThe story, in its thousand variations, went something like this: Long, long before the present time, in the days when men lifted silver wings and mated with the stars, the Great and Terrible Queen Durga arose, an agent of chaos in a land rent with strife - her seductive promises beguiled the Court into submission, and the ones her words could not reach, her Dark Agents cowed into silence. It was said that her reign brought the entirety of Hind to its knees, stifling the tongues and words of men with arcane orders, killing the Sikhs and Muslims in their temples, seducing the farmers into working for her designs. Some stories recorded that she had tamed the Power of the Sun herself, bringing horror-fire upon the Earth as a gift to her enemies.\n\nMost saw it as a cautionary tale, but as is customary with these stories, some took it as a prophecy. Eventually a warlord arose in the lands far to the West, where the Great Indus touched the sea. His conquests stretched from the Indus to the wetlands of Bengal, and in his consuming arrogance he dared to take upon himself the True Name of Durga, the name that none dared speak. It was a step too far, even for the most loyal of his retinue. The Emperor Indira Gandhi, Second Of His Name, was killed in his sleep in the tenth year of His Reign by Sikh bodyguards angered by His insolence. His empire ripped apart like an old satin sheet - and the tale of Goddess Durga took on one final, terrible twist."

In the chaos that swept Jai Hind as the cities torched, the forces leapt upon each other, a frenzy of violence echoing through the poisoned air.\n\nPosterity has forgotten the name of the Free general who, in his wisdom, gave the order to cease fighting and focus the arms and effort of the men still alive to keep the villages safe from raiders and famine. It was a sentiment many on the other side of the Bengali border agreed with. And so the two set their arms aside and began the quiet, painful task of healing the world.\n\nSlowly order came like sense to a drunken head, in fits and starts and aches and pains. Village by village submitted to the rule of the Guards, as they were now known, for security and for the skills the Guards' considerable civilian retinues offered. Brickworks, navigation, the lost arts of medicine. Flowers grew in barracks and rifle ranges converted to terraced fields - rusting hangars and planes and bombs were disassembled for their parts.\n\nEventually the Guards themselves forgot their origin. But for reasons unknown even to them, for centuries after its purpose had been forgotten, two members of the elite Guards would march to each other at the bustling capital city of Checkpoint, wave their swords at each other, and salute a tattered flag upon which could be seen, in faint imprints, the stitched-together pattern of two vanished nations. The composite banner would wave in the afternoon sun, and on occasion the onlookers would feel a strange sadness for something they had never known as they watched it, like watching the colors of the evening fade to dusk-grey."

We were taught that this land was holy, that the race of Vishnu and Shiva would reign sovereign over the land bequeathed unto us from its beginning: now we faltered. Our faith was lost. Our numbers dwindling, our people starving, our lands burnt into broken ash, all melted into chaos and despair. Even the Scriptures were lost to us, that of Sarvakar and Golkawar and the Palis, all gone with the burning of precious oldpaper for fire or in accidents.\n\nA Teacher, one of the last of his kind, led us across the great dying plain that girdles the Ganges like a priest's belt. The hundreds of us that were left followed his lead through fire and flame, fighting off bandits at night and walking through burned towns by day. It is said some of our kin are still born deformed from the dark magick seeping through the Black Lands we traversed. But we survived, and at last the Teacher called us to halt near a great marbled building: even seared by the flames of the Burning, it was beautiful in our eyes.\n\nAs the Teacher lay dying, racked by great gouts of blood-coughing, he called us to hearken unto the inscriptions of the Dome: to learn the inscriptions and its language by heart, and to take the Dome itself as the new Heart of Hind. How could this, he reasoned, be anything less than a divine temple, built in forgotten ages by holy men to worship our God?\n\nThe Teacher is long dead, and his tomb forgotten, but we of the R'shtri Swaysvak Sanh - the name must remain even if its meaning is lost - have not forgotten his teaching. We have mastered the Arabick, surely the purest, most beautiful language of the Bharat Hindis, and upon the marbled frame of this Ta' Mahal we are building Jai Hind once more, pure, Indian and free of foreign influence. For it is as the Great Avatar Muhammad has said: O India our land - our land is one!"

Dance! For the universe shall find true grounding in the waving of arms made sacred by motion, and by the desire for Oneness of land, Oneness of being, Oneness of heart. God knows who I am! Bullah! To me, I am not known - for I exist not outside the Republic of Souls, binding us all in the Godhead of Blood and Soil. Though the world stumbled and Creation broke in great gouts of flame, the Godhead persists still. And so do we.\n\nWe walk and pray and walk, across the face of God, across this jewel of a Land, to cities and towns and dirt-scrabbling hovels, and we preach the same message, over and over. Gandhi, the Prophet, called for the Union of all the Universe under a pure white spinning-wheel banner, and we shall follow his call in life and death.

But the men arguing against the castes had been there for as long as Nayr could remember, too: sages, Raoist worker-priests, even kings and princes spoke in his father's courts against the system which no one could fully understand or explain, not even those who memorized the Palis. As the parades of his accession drifted past his stage like clouds past a mountain, King Nayr watched the Kingdom unrolled before him. So many united in a common cause - from the heights of the throne, who could tell Brahmin from Untouchable? Still, he knew the politics of the Court forbade him from making such a statement. There was too much to lose, the crown far too ponderous to tolerate such a subtle blow.\n\nFortune came in the form of the Bandit-Kings: Kerah and its merchant-city sisters fell before the ravages of the Tyrant Nameless And Terrible. No longer would Nayr have to remain silent: he issued a call to arms - and the Untouchables rose up to defend the King, aided by Nayr's personal moneys and armaments, including precious Oldworld magicks in the Places of Study. The Untouchables proved themselves fierce as tigers in combat, breaking upon the Tyrant's armies in bloody foam. They pierced through to the heart of the army itself, dragging him from the iron-chariot he rode. At the end of the battle, watching the masses fall away leaderless towards the calving North, King Nayr raised the Untouchable Generals' hands high in victory.\n\nThat day the ancient walls, built so high and so wide in Tam'lnadh, began to crumble, and centuries after Nayr himself had expired they had eroded to the point that no-one could quite recall what Untouchables had even been, other than a guild of warriors unchallengeable in battle and humble in victory. Hind's choked masses, in this province at least, breathed freely, and the air was filled with strange new hopes."

Excepting the recruitment of the occasional orphan or stray beggar from the village's periphery, there was no real body of witnesses to comment on their comings and goings: if you were in the Buddhas, you stayed in the Buddhas.\n\nOne day a little boy from the village decided to sneak into the Smiling Buddha's main encampment, working his way in from the dense forest-canopy that surrounded the camp. As guards marched in and out of the brick-red complex, badly discolored in places with what might have been the application of mismatched paint, the boy watched the routes they took. A strategic opening presented itself, and he slipped into the workings, ignoring the rusted-over sign over that forgotten door: RADIATION HAZARD WITHIN FACILITY.\n\nHe came before a vast array of blackened plastic and glass signs, worn thin and brittle with disuse. It was not hard to imagine, as his father had told him, the lights blinking on and off in the tens and hundreds, although only oil-wicks were left to light the vast room. He was still watching the signs and the black surfaces when the guards came for him, wearing peculiar heavy suits and armored masks.\n\nThe boy took weeks to recover, coughing up blood and losing most of his hair; it took the efforts of the entire village to extricate him from the hospital-prison the Buddhas had left him in. When the boy grew up and had a family of his own, he told his children only one thing:"

It felt - no, it must have been - cowhide, which created a host of problems for Ashgar. He wasn't an observant Hindu, thankfully enough, but the Priests would no doubt raise hell if they found out.\n\nWell, it wouldn't help even if he raised queries about it now. Elder Srinaga wanted the Document handled and put into the Reliquaries as soon as humanly possible - from what Ashgar was given to understand, this invited a great deal of laxity into what the Priests would take in terms of material as long as the Documents were recorded. Hopefully the Elders would take a piece of errant parchment in stride - just to make sure it wasn't immediately obvious, Ashgar made notes to the next Scribe to cure the cowskin after his inscriptions, making its origin less obvious.\n\nNow, for the Document itself. Most of the records had been lost with the Burning and the Deluge, but this copy was still in fairly good working order. Perhaps it had belonged to some old prince-minister or warrior and so avoided the chaos that claimed the cities. Certainly its contents commanded respect from the Elders to the extent that they had been willing to part with a fair sum of coin to write it. Well, if his employers demanded it, who was he to refuse?\n\nAshgar prepared his quill, tapping the inkwell a couple of times, and began to write. "WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having firmly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SECULAR SOCIALIST DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens -" It appeared to be the most boring of scripts, the type that dictated laws and rights.

Bitterly he swore on the name of his ancestors that he would find the traitor-bloodkin responsible for this treachery, but before revenge could be plotted the Project took immediate precedence. For the fifth time in a decade the great Street-Map was assembled from its carefully preserved fragments (why had the Old Ones put such priceless knowledge in such fragile paper sheets? God only knew how they had protected their works of art) and Nu Delhi was plotted out to the last detail, on a carefully handcrafted table made for just this purpose.\n\nThe writings and the street-plottings contained within were added to the Street-Map in annotations of ink, made on side-scraps of paper attached to the main corpus. This was not, however, the main problem. The real issue was one of resource constraints: with existing stonecarving and masonry manpower and supplies it would be insufficient to simply keep relying on the donations of the local Prince, and in fact even the brick and stone deposits they had in reserve were no longer sufficient to accommodate the revised demands. Something would have to give.\n\nAjay's eye was drawn to the local map, for in the past his Household had discovered a few precious quarries and oldtech deposits by scrutinizing the surrounding region. When the Great Fires came they destroyed much, but they had not scorched all the offenders of the Gods off the earth. Perhaps some of them remained to be dug up and sold, or to be used. At least that was the logic the Great-Father of the Clan had used when he began the process of restoring the city, so many decades ago.\n\nAjay's gaze caught something: a dot, obscured by mold and dust, with the markings DELHI on it. A city of the Old Ones, so close to Nu-Delhi, named after the same city he was trying to restore: this could only be the hand of God himself! Leaping to his feet, he called for his master-scavengers to assemble, already preparing the scavenging crews. Yes, for Nu-Delhi to rise, this pretender Delhi would be disassembled, brick by brick, until his family's creation stood complete and beautiful in the wrappings and stones of its sister.

In the time since the Desolation, many new creatures had made a place for themselves along the great Ganges, though many puzzled over their origin. For the most ancient of texts that survived the fires spoke only of a few of these beings, such as the elephants, the tigers and the peafowl. Of the great lyon and the fearsome heppo and the elegant zeehorse and all manner of other strange and wondrous creatures, the texts maintained a brooding silence.\n\nThe only explanation lay in the legends. It is said that the gods revealed themselves to their most faithful of believers, and tasked them with the role of the Keepers. They were commanded to build a great menagerie of all the beasts of the earth, even those from beyond their lands. A special place was crafted for each animal, styled after their homes so that their hearts would not grow longing to return. For a time, men of the old nations would come to see their realm and gaze in awe at all the bounty of the earth. And then - for reasons unknown - the world was plunged into a thousand years of darkness.\n\nAnd yet the Keepers did not stray from their sacred task. Through the struggle and the pain, they protected their charges from the forces of the shadow, and from greedy mortals looking for a feast. Even through the worst times the animals grew yet more numerous, and when the light of rebirth finally shone back upon the earth, the Keepers released their flock back into a world that was once more ready for them.\n\nIt is said that the gods still smile upon those who protect the beasts of the world in times of hardship. For every creature, great and small, is as worthy of kindness and respect as the mightiest king."

Their destination, pristine and unmarred, awaits them at the top.\n\nThe Seven Suns had come and gone, purging the mortal plane of both good and evil. Rivers boiled to ash, the works of man became works in ruins, plains of grass burned into ash and soot. The souls of billions departed to their next lives as their bodies burned or fell to wound, hunger, or pestilence. Truly, the world had experienced a great harrowing, from which it might never truly recover.\n\nYet as the fates would have it, the mountains of Himalaya and Bod suffered only the proverbial touch of sunburn. A thousand thousand suns may have engulfed the sky in warm orange glow, but nowhere near the world's highest peaks. Nowhere near their temples, embedded onto their cliffs and slopes as if they were natural extensions. In the end, all that remained of the Buddha's teachings made manifest are those scattered all over the Rooftop and its Plateau.\n\nFinally, their guide arrived and ambled to them, dressed in the warm wools of the Sherpa.

He had resolved to take action, and thus would the tales record how the future ruler of all the world he had knowledge of began his mission.\n\nHe began by gathering the poor, the disaffected, and the outcasts. He gave them respect, and they gave him their undying loyalty in exchange. He gave them a purpose in life, and they returned the favor by fulfilling his. As if by magic, cities and villages fell under his leadership overnight. The people gravitated toward his magnetic charms and almost hypnotic powers of oration. He even took the title of the Gandhi, connecting himself to a legendary figure said to have lived in the time before the Deluge. As the people of every city-state and nation embraced him in turn, he proclaimed himself the Chakravarti.\n\nWith minimal conflict, this former monk had united one of the great peoples of the earth for the first time in centuries. Under his gentle hand, the people no longer had to fear the whims of petty tyrants or have to worry about going hungry, for he planned out his heavenly empire on earth with great care.\n\nWhen he finally passed, he was venerated as a god and the Temple of the Chakravarti remained a dominant influence in the east long after there were none who still remembered the beauty of his words or the appeal of his personality.

The foreigners spoke a strange tongue to each other - some of the elders whispered that it sounded like the dialects their grandfathers from the South had used - but they were passably conversant in the local tongue. A meeting was arranged with the village head, who granted them permission to perform in the meeting square.\n\nThe play began with a clash of swords: men with their faces painted ghoulishly white pranced around the stage, fighting and hooting at each other in an alien speech. Another group of men, wearing the traditional dresses of actors, came on stage, and were waylaid by the white-faced men - the plates of grain they were carrying spilled across the theatre, drawing gasps from the audience. A young boy about Abhijit's age ran across the theatre stage, shouting for his family: just off his field of vision the white-faced men threw his parents off the stage. Crying men and women marched in chains, with the white men riding them. Here the latter acquired a new name. Englishmen. The makers of Famine and the harbingers of Death. Then, roars and thunder to the East: a great ragged banner, white with a red sun in the centre, rose and felled the Englishmen, to the cheers of all in the audience.\n\nThe men and women in traditional dress came together in the middle of the stage, waving a new flag: this one with yellow and green stripes, with a red-accented tiger in the middle. They sang a song of a land called Azad Hind, and of the freedom of the people of Great India.

It suited our lifestyle well enough though, for most of what we heard about the outside and its worldly desires did not enthuse us. My life had a clear structure, consisting of meditation, study, and chores. My days were consumed by the routine, although I believe that it taught me something new every day, about the monastic life, so that I could teach the wisdom of Buddha, just as he had to his disciples. Yet I only understood it fully on the day the world was set on fire.\n\nI remember that day perfectly, for it was so ordinary and then suddenly so horrifyingly different. From the mountain perch of the monastery, I watched as the cities in the distance exploded and burned. I saw how the villagers rushed up the mountain to seek shelter, lest death came for them in their homes too. I saw all of this, and I ran from it. I was so terrified that I lost all sense of direction. When I finally stopped, I looked up to find that I had wandered into a cavern. Right in front of me, was a tiny statue of Buddha, flanked by two lit braziers.\n\nHad the monastery been destroyed behind me, leaving with me as the last human left? So overwhelming was my fear and despair that I must have fainted. Surely, I had died and was waiting to be reborn. But instead, I watched the rise and fall of empires, through the eyes of mighty kings and wretched labourers. I lived as four good men and as four evil men. I ended the world and then I tried to save it. In the myriad worlds I wandered in, I felt the pain of life cut short, and I felt the joy of death postponed. Last of all, I saw Buddha walk the cracked and ruined Earth, with a lotus sprouting with each barefoot step he took, until the Earth was restored to verdant splendor. He turned his head to smile at me, before I awoke on the cavern floor.\n\nOne of the other monks found me not long after and guided me back to the monastery, quite untouched by the fires. The devastation beyond still saddened me, but I could already see the new world starting to grow, in the hearts of all mankind."

When Arjun waged his last campaign against the chariot people and met his first and last defeat, he did not bring the talwar along with him, the blade being kept in his palace, built at the confluence of two small rivers with water that flows green. Arjun's death at the hands of the chariot people was blamed on his conquest proceeding without his holy sword, and so all those lords who had bowed to him and now sought to take over his kingdom converged on his palace. There the greatest of all battles was fought between their armies, ending more lives than all of Arjun's conquests ever had. The twin green rivers of the palace grounds were masked by the red of the blood that was shed, and when the last living vassal of Arjun, the victor of the battle, went to the rivers to wash off the blood from the blade, the waters only stained the talwar red for all time.\n\nThe last lord wielded the talwar in public, to show to the people of Arjun's kingdom that he was the conqueror's heir, that the sword rested with him. But the people remembered their conqueror's sword well, and his talwar was not a red one. Arjun had been merciful in his conquests, and had not taken his weapon to the people of the farms and sullied either his blade's colour or his soul's sanctity with the taking of innocent life. And so the people did not know of their emperor's sword to ever be red, and they knew the last lord was a cutthroat and a liar.

Alas, the escapade would lose them the Anzac, scuppered by the last of the Japanese shells. Not to be deterred, the crew would spend nearly a year fashioning a New Anzac from wood, canvas and other materials found on the island.\n\nBack on the seas, the men pressed on. Sailing north to Vanatu and then west towards Papua, they would many years hopping from island to island, battling crazed Imperial soldiers, cannibalistic natives, sirens, the Kraken and all manner of other beasts - or so the stories would say. But regardless, the crew would never lose hope of seeing the great Down Under once again. And one bright sunny day, long after the last fires of the end had gone out, they would finally land in Cape Melvine amidst verdant corals and sandy shores.\n\nThe sagas would never really focus on what happened after. Some would return home to whatever remained of their families, in the hopes of providing some semblance of a future for them. Others would wander, and find whatever living could be had in the new Australia. And a few who had come to love the sea that had been their home would simply take the New Anzac and sail back out, never having to set foot upon the cursed earth again."

Trips like this were always risky - Straya was vast, and the towns that were left were separated by thousands of miles of baked earth. He had planned this one carefully, rationed their water, but the lost tyre on the scrublands had cost them valuable time. He craned his eyes - could it be? God yes, a building - he must be here. He eased his foot onto the brake, preparing for the long business of stopping a hundred tonnes of machine.\n\nSamson stretched his aching limbs as he clambered out of the cabin and took in the cargo he was hauling. The three trailers were hitched to a mighty tractor cabin that bore decades of slow wear - but she kept going. Them in the Before sure knew how to build machines, and his father had taught him how to keep her running in thick and thin. It had been his lifeline - and now it was all of theirs.\n\nA small crowd had gathered in response to his arrival. Their leader, a tall aboriginal fella, stepped forward. "What brings you to Mparntwe?" he asked brusquely, in a thick accent.\n\nSam furrowed his brow. "Nothing. I thought this was The Alice?"\n\nThe man snorted. "We do not use your names anymore. This is Mparntwe."\n\nIt meant nothing to Sam either way. "Well whatever it is, we're just passing through. We need water, though, as much as you have."\n\nThe negotiations continued long after - the aboriginal, who seemed to be the only one who spoke English, appeared to show some sympathy after he was explained their situation. They hauled open the doors of the first trailer. The people crammed inside gasped at the sudden burst of light that illuminated their cramped home. They were packed like sardines, some twenty of them and everything they had ever owned, crammed into a metal box.\n\n"We at Perth yet, da?" Sam shook his head. "Not yet. Got us some more water. Make it last." The boy was already snatching at the flask he was holding, and ran back to share it with the grubby, dust caked children that had become his friends in the darkness.\n\nSam spared a few dribbles of water to clear the dust from his windscreen, not that it would last.

It was certainly not seaworthy. Yet, it was the islanders' only hope. They were to starve, or they were to sail. And the ocean beckoned.\n\nEach man, woman, and child united to mend the boat and to install hundreds and hundreds of oars. After years of progress, the taro no longer grew, but the boat was finished. It still rusted, and a large chunk was missing, but oars a dozen feet long protruded into the water. A specially constructed crane applied pressure, and it was off, into the sea. The men, no longer stranded, danced with joy. Onto the sea they cast off, in search of another island. The first they sighted was infested with snakes. One could hardly step onto the beach without one shooting out of the sand. The next island was overpopulated. It was as if they had returned home to an alternate reality, one where they had never had a boat to escape their home. The people there were starved. They only had so long left.

In other words, the thieves intent on relieving Mushtarri's Society of the Altar were running a fool's errand.\n\nEven so, he expected the B'orists to make a terrible fuss about the unexpected loss, and he prepared his statement in skin-parchment carefully. He emphasized that the Altars (more were being found each year, dredged out of pits in the lands to the South) represented not just the Birth-Forges and the Engines of Creation the B'orists believed they were descended from, but a slender connection to the Oldworld - a terrible, irretrievable loss for the whole of Mankind.\n\nPositioning his next words very carefully - B'orists were known for their emotional fragility and occasional bouts of violence - he commented that given the rich body of knowledge stored by the Monks of Moz'bik on this type of Altar was sufficiently comprehensive to understand its value, both as a Divine connection and as an artefact. It was known, for instance, that this Altar was called by the oldname "tanque", and that it fired "kanons", although what precisely those kanons had been or what they had used for their quivers no one could tell. He ended by pleading for time and patience, in hopes of an eventual solution.\n\nHe got his answer in the vivid descriptions of the Altar-Breaking. A group of ruffians from far in the Southlands had placed upon the Altar mounds of gunpowder-canisters, in a village sympathetic to their villainy, and chanting vanished slogans they had detonated the Altar upon a pyre of explosive death, taking themselves with it.

In fact, they were looking to isolate themselves from the world forever and the great fortifications would help deter any invaders or, in the worst case, fight them back. The world after the Event was scary, they said. Allies were few, yet enemies were plenty, and no one could know if the Event could repeat itself, like some legends said it would. For the government, the only solution was to look inwards.\n\nJacob got back up. It only took a few hours until the sector was finished, and with it all of the Wall.

Then he found that some were pointing at the old swastika-shaped medal on his chest, and their expression quickly changed into disgust.

In times past they were mighty warriors who ruled an Empire of their own, with a Caliph in the forgotten city of Roma. They came to the shores of Al-Quds in their fight against the devil raiders of old, the Britishe, and after they drove the Britishe into the seas they stayed of their own accord, till Allah in all his infinite wisdom did strike down their empire and all the sinful kingdoms of old.\n\nEven today the Italien adhere to their own faith, though they are considered a people of the book by most of the more learned scholars. Without their Caliph however their faith is shattered and disunited, and it is unlikely our foes the Desert Foxes can sway them from our side. Indeed, the Italien have ever since their conquest by your honoured grandfather been loyal servants of your house, the horsemen and men at arms they provide in tribute have been part of many a successful campaign and even to this day they man the border forts of the silted channel.\n\nBut oh Sultan of Sultans, be wary of the Italien lest they grow too influential in their dealings within our realm. Never must a single of their Ceptina's rise too far above the others and be a potential threat, nor must they be allowed to solely guard the palace, lest you or your sons find yourselves at their mercies one day.\n\nAs the clerics of old said, keep your allies close, and your enemies closer."

For centuries mankind had a fascination with the beast, even as it was driven from its range in Europe and the Near East, it retained a bastion in Africa. But even there man hunted it almost into extinction, not for any true threat the mighty cat posed to them, but for sport and trophies.\n\nThe German dominion over Africa was good for the lions in a way, sport hunting was something still indulged in by the German elite but they were less thorough about it than the British and French, some individuals like the Reichskommissar Mueller aside. But even though the impact was lessened by the time the apocalypse started the lions of Africa were barely clinging to life in the outskirts of their former ranges.\n\nIn a curious turn of fate however, the nuclear apocalypse that spelled doom for so much of humanity also represented the salvation of the big cats, a few lean years aside much of their range was now human free. Unnoticed by mankind, the lions began to reoccupy their former range, from the scattered Afrikaner territories in the south all the way up to the Nile Delta. It was to be there on the shores of the Red Sea that a single, minor event that had not happened in millenia occured.\n\nA pride of lions twelve strong moved across the silted up canal that had once been the most important trade artery in the world. After three thousand years, lions had returned to the Middle East."

The tribe of the south, however, lived on fertile land, and, though they were sometimes short on water, could grow large amounts of food, and their weavings and dances were also envied by the people of the Lyvan.\n\nIn the past, they had been great enemies; for generations they had fought and died over the smallest scraps, and sometimes even less than that. But the tribes now knew that in spite of all of their differences, the same red blood ran through their veins, the same love for their families filled their hearts, and the same hope for the future permeated their very souls. The violence would end today.\n\nThey clasped each other's arms, embraced one another, and swore on their families that they would no longer war over the smallest scraps of food, but instead protect and feed one another. They were now a family, in their own way.\n\nThe peace could not last forever, everyone knew, but the memory of this day would not be forgotten. For years to come, the two tribes would work together to feed their families, build their own towns and cities, and protect the land they all loved so much.\n\nAnd so it was that the Ya'srael and the Pa'lestin tribes made peace, after so many years of heartache and despair."

"What was life like? When you were my age?"\n\nHussain was silent for a moment. Memories, both traumatic and pure, flooded his mind's eye, and he spent a moment contemplating. Finally, he replied, "It was better, and worse in ways. We had more to eat, a house to call our own. We had a lot of things. But there were bad things as well." "Italians?" offered Masud, innocently, eliciting a chuckle from Hussein.\n\n"Yes, I always did hate their constant marching.

Faltering a smoking, juddering in the air, was Old Jabal and his flying machine.

Imam's salt-and-pepper beard had grown more salt than pepper by now, and he walked with a limp as old men do. As Imam tossed what little coins he had to a beggar, the young man went up to him and asked, "Imam, why do you spend your coin on others, but not on yourself?"\n\nImam gave him another smile, and said in a raspier voice: "Allah protects the faithful, lad." The young man remained confused: again with the Allah. Who is Allah? But Mama called for him suddenly, and Imam urged the young man to go.\n\nMore years passed, and the young man became a grown man. Imam no longer left the tower, so weak had he become. Still, he refused to take the medicine the villagers offered.

Still, it was inevitable that they would be forced to deal with the consequences of such an extraordinary event sooner or later, as they well knew even if none vocalized the thought. They predicted this correctly, although none of them could have possibly imagined their point of contact with the after effects of the destruction of civilization would play out the way it did.\n\nIt was perhaps a week or more after the band first encountered the refugee who relayed the grim news that they came across the boy. His parents had evidently taken him in an ill-conceived attempt to flee the danger by heading into the relatively safe desert. They had not managed to make it very far at all though, and the parents in question lay dead around the small child, as if they intended to shield him in their final act.\n\nFor a group like the band that lived in the harsh environment of the desert by remaining as efficient as possible with all advisable resources, the idea of taking on a non-productive, attention requiring new member was downright dangerous, and yet, looking at the child, the head of the band felt moved to his core. In this time of great suffering for all mankind, it did not matter in the least that the child was not their own, it made no difference that upon his head sat a yarmulke, or that the band was all Muslim.

 RAD_ME.21.desc:0 "Let it be known to all that in the Thirty-Third Year of Empire, I, Kyzyl Khan, conquered this place. With my steeds of iron, I conquered the riverlands of Arrak, laying down the yoke of the Red Horde from mountain to sea. On this very spot, I received the submission of the peasant folk, who swore eternal fealty to the bloodline of Momush Khan, First Khan of the Red Horde.\n\nLet it be known that I was terrible in battle, yet magnanimous in victory. Those who submitted to my rule have prospered as never before. Not even in the Years of Dissolution, before Great Tengri unleashed fire upon this unworthy earth, did the land of Arrak know peace and tranquility such as Kyzyl Khan has imposed upon it.\n\nLet it be known that even the fallen cities betwixt the Twin Rivers are part of the domain of the Kyzyl Khan. The blood of Momush Khan does not fear the dust and ashes left behind by those judged unworthy to walk upon Great Tengri's sacred earth. The sages and shamans were in accordance that the poison spirits who once blighted the land had passed on, fleeing before the Red Horde's advance. In their wake lay a trove of treasures bestowed by Great Tengri, a blessing for his chosen son: guns, mechanical steeds, and enough food to feed the entire Red Horde for a decade! Yet, let it be known that Kyzyl Khan was no petty warlord who acted in pursuit of wealth - he shared the fruits of Heaven with the people of the riverlands, that they might recognise the just and pious nature of his rule.\n\nLet it be known that it was here, at the crossroads of the world and among the ashes of empires, that the Red Horde found its home. Here, the fires of war were tamed to forge an iron-wrought peace, hard-won and well-deserved. Here, Kyzyl Khan decreed that the time for battle had passed, and that Great Tengri's approval had finally been earned. Here, the world began again."

 RAD_ME.22.desc:0 "The first merchant was not much more than a refugee carrying wares. He left his home in the south after the great deluge, but never abandoned his profession. Drifting down the Nile, towards the north, he would trade what little he had for what little they would give. He settled in a little rebuilt village, just north of the first cataract. In time, he would create a family, and a lineage.\n\nHis descendants would float down the same Nile. His son grew to be a hardy young man, and he departed from the little town to the settlements farther north. There he met a young woman. They had three daughters. One was a stillbirth. The other died of malaria just before she became a proper woman. The final one looked south and wished to take the occupation of those before her. She returned to the little village that her grandfather had lived in and watched as the laborers toiled to build a palace, with pillars and swirling friezes that told stories of the gods and the ones before them. At the plaza, she bought the work of these skilled craftsmen. The village was more than just a village, now. Perhaps the woman could sell them for more past the cataracts.\n\nSo past the cataracts she went, into the ancient land far south. The people there were strange and disfigured, of multiple heads and singular limbs. They were the stuff of nightmares. The first of her family to be literate she kept an account.\n\nOn her return to the homeland, she passed on the texts to a group of children, who asked for her to teach them of the lands and of reading. In time, more came to teach the children, and more learned men and women spread stories of lands afar. In time, the most esteemed university in the Old Crescent was founded."

 RAD.14.t:0 "Remembrance Day" # Hooked up
 RAD.14.desc:0 "The first year after the end of all things was the hardest. Mass starvation, disease, radiation - the death of hope. As mankind's light flickered and waned most believed that their demise would be forgotten, as would humanity as a whole. Every accomplishment, every beautiful artwork, every squalling child brought from the womb into their mother's tired arms, all had been a pointless waste. A cosmological oddity soon lost to the ravages of time.\n\nIt started in different ways, in different places, and some took longer than others. But the first commemorations of the old world began a year to the day after the bombs fell - give or take a few sunrises. In Germany, the shattered remnants of battalions would hold mock gun salutes for their fallen brothers, only conserving their ammunition to face the horrors of the end. In America, priests and their flocks found whatever safe places they could to plant hundreds of crosses, to honor the fallen patriots. In Japan, shrines were constructed from scrap metal and rubble and whatever other detritus could be scavenged, to bring peace to restless spirits.\n\nIt was ad hoc, at first, and the people only gave it their effort if they could afford to take time away from survival. But as the years went on, each culture would do their best to keep the memory alive in their own special way. In Britain, survivors would lay out poppies and wreaths of whatever other flowers could be found in memory of the ghosts of Albion. In Russia, men would meet on the day to drink to the memory of the lost sons of the motherland. From the Americas to Oceania, from the depths of Africa to the far reaches of Asia, the dead would be honored.\n\nEven as the last vestiges of the Old World became myth and the memory of what exactly was being commemorated was forgotten, cultures continued to mourn what was lost. The Empire State would devote parades and poems to the ancestors lost to the ancient flame. The Muhlar tribe would hold a great hunt every year on what they believed to be the day of the end. In Zion prayers would be held within the dome of the Third Temple to give blessings to the ancient dead and thanks for their own survival.\n\nOne day, a man would set foot on the moon, and find an ancient, bleached flag. He would look to the Earth, and remember those who had set foot here long before, and say a quiet poem in their memory."
