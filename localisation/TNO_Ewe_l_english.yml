 EWE_idea_language_barrier:0 "The Language Barrier"
 EWE_idea_language_barrier_desc:0 "The young democracy of Ghana was formed from the fusion of the British Gold Coast and French Togoland in the face of the collapse of their respective empires. Whilst the motives behind Raphael Armattoe's diplomatic feat may have been noble, it has as a result left our nation half English speaking and half French speaking, to say nothing of the indigenous languages. Until this state of affairs can be somehow resolved, both the political and cultural landscape of Ghana will remain deeply divided."
 EWE_idea_bloated_high_command:0 "Bloated High Command"
 EWE_idea_bloated_high_command_desc:0 "The creation of Ghana was a peaceful affair, decades of diplomatic effort put towards ethinic and tribal reconciliations to enable our unification. Yet one of the most common diplomatic bargaining chips was promising an abundance of people a role in the new state. Nowhere can this be more seen than in the General Staff, where dozens of generals who know little of modern warfare now bicker tirelessly over every aspect of how the military should operate."
 
 POLITICS_KOMLA_AGBELI_GBEDEMAH_DESC:0 "The politics of Ghana is, in the image of its history, messy. It is a mix of the British colony of the Gold Coast, and of Togo, an ex-German colony that became a French colony, until the war where it got its independence. When the chaos of the bombing period forced both governments to cooperate, they created a nation of two, and the Ghana Republic was born. The local United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) was tasked to build a strong and free republic, and indeed they did. \n\nOr so it is what it looks like to an untrained eye. In reality, a coalition of Ghanian political strongmen called "the Big Six'' controls the UGCC behind the scenes, and by extension everything that matters in Ghanian politics, as there is no opposition to their rule. Even the victory in the 1956 elections of Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, nicknamed "Afro Gbede'', was all part of their plan. Gbedemah had humble beginnings in the timber trade, but by joining the UGCC he quickly rose through the ranks forming friendships with several Big Six members like Edward Akufo-Addo, the previous President, and Kwame Nkrumah, founder of the Convention People's Party. Owing favors to both, Afro Gbede wanted to keep Akufo-Addo as his prime minister, but he also promised complete support to Kwame Nkrumah that he would achieve his vision for an anticolonialist and socialist Ghana, which is at odds with Gbedemeah's liberal and pro-western stance. \n\nThe inaction from Gbedemah's faction led to a complete collapse of his party's support, and has started an enormous rise in popularity of the opposition. Tensions are brewing in Togo while the army is preparing for the worst. Afro Gbede must act quickly if he does not want his schemes to unravel and come crashing down on him and the Big Six."
