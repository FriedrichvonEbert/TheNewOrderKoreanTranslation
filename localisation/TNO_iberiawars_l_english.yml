 iberiawars.998.d:0 "Fernando sat in his office, gazing out the window at his officers frantically preparing the barricades all over the town of Gibraltar. His golden hat and over-ornamented uniform felt heavier than they had in months, and the pleasant buzz of the illicit pleasures of Gibraltar had turned into a wash of cold horror within his head.\n\nWith trembling hands, he stripped the hat off, removing the weight from his head. Next to go was his new golden adornment, dropped on the floor without a care. He continued to stare, thinking about the terrors that were about to descend upon his position.\n\nHe could flee, he knew that. He could run to Italy, or Greece, with his riches, and-\n\nAnd die, when the tidal waves would destroy everything.\n\nAs he thought, a feeling that he had not felt in years slipped over him, hardening his expression like iron. With manic abandon, he tore open his wardrobe, and gazed upon something that had been abandoned since he had taken over in the first place.\n\nSeamless white, with gold braid. It was dusty, and somewhat disheveled from being ignored for so long.\n\nBut now... it was not the time for pleasure. All parties had to end, and his time had come long ago.\n\nHe slipped the old hat back on, and wiped the dust off the crest of the Iberian Navy on the front. With automatic ease, he straightened seams that had been softened by disuse.\n\nNow was not the time for games. Now was the time to be a hero once more."

 iberiawars.1.t:0 "The Basque Republic Declares Independence"
 iberiawars.1.d:0 "It's no secret that the Iberian Union has been riddled with conflict in recent times. Since its inception, the union has been a shaky alliance fraught with over-bloated bureaucracy, conflicts of interests between its member states, and insurgents at every corner. Yet, even with such glaring flaws, the union had managed to stagger on for many years after its formation.\n\nHowever, recently the union has seen a decline. Instability grows, popular discontent rises, and insurgent groups have become increasingly emboldened in their attempts to supplant the weak government's rule with their own; And today, one of those attempts was successful.\n\nThe strike was swift. What was reported to be small groups of mere dozens of radicals became hundreds, then thousands, then tens of thousands. Soon the meager garrisons and police forces had been overrun, and nearly the whole of the basque country stood under the control of triumphant revolutionaries, eager to defend their independence.\n\nWith the declaration of an independent basque country, the Iberian government has been thrown into utter chaos. Initial attempts to contain the uprising have thus far failed, and without  an organized military response soon, a catastrophe will surely be at hand. The fate of the Union lies in the balance, and only time will tell how this conflict is resolved..."
 iberiawars.1.a:0 "Viva Iberia!"
 iberiawars.1.b:0 "Cora Euskadi!"

 iberiawars.2.t:0 "Retaking the Basque Country"
 iberiawars.2.d:0 "The Basque country revolt had thrown our armed forces in the northern region of the Union into a horrific state of disarray. Only through the quick and effective intervention of civilian officials could the various army units be evacuated from the region without falling to the strength of the rebels. The action has allowed the officers to organise a regrouping which has transformed the weakened forces back into a functional fighting force, albeit a diminished one.\n\nMilitary high command has given strict orders to recapture the lost region by quickly seizing the heartlands of the revolt. Their method of doing such shall be to use the units which had fled to advance in a pincer movement through both Bilbao and Navarra at the same time. In effect this would split the disorganised rebel forces hopefully causing great supply issues, whilst also ensuring an encirclement of a majority of their troops which would lead to their capture at minimal losses.  The plan has however been criticised by the senior officers of the reorganised Iberian army units who claim that they simply do not have enough forces to execute the plan in an effective manner. With reinforcements the current problems may be remedied they argue. With the widespread instability across the Union no further troops can however be spared to assist in the mission. With this in mind a hard decision has to hence be made, only one of the pincers can go ahead. Do we either push through Bilbao, which has been judged to likely be the harder affair due to the presence of a majority of the newly formed Basque militias, or go via Navarra, the much longer option which however will have nowhere near the same resistance as Bilbao? With the first plan we could eventually secure a swift and decisive victory but would also risk a devastating loss. The issue with the second is that we ultimately would still need to cross into the Basque region to finish the revolt which may result in us also facing large resistance."
 iberiawars.2.a:0 "Time is of the essence, strike Bilbao!"
 iberiawars.2.b:0 "We must ensure the success of our mission, invade through Navarra."
 
 iberiawars.3.t:0 "Portugal abandons the Union"
 iberiawars.3.d:0 "The chronic instability created by the Basque revolt has spread throughout the entire Union, taking root inside the Iberian central government. The many Portuguese officials whose loyalty was always to their national identity and Caudillo Salazar first began to grumble as soon as the first reports of the revolt came in. The final straw was triggered when Salazar abandoned all hope of maintaining the sinking ship. Caudillo Salazar attempted to escape Madrid without much fuss but was quickly put under house arrest in his local residence in the Iberian capital. Only with the support of loyal followers was the old man able to stage a successful nighttime getaway.\n\nA mass exodus of Portuguese government officials and military personnel followed, leaving behind an administrative vacuum that Spanish bureaucrats hurriedly attempted to fill. Lisbon has now become a hotbed of revolutionary fervour. The cries for independence and self governance are resonating all across the Union. Salazar's public broadcasts have rallied the Porutgues people to form militia divisions to fight alongside the national army against Unionist forces."
 iberiawars.3.a:0 "Viva Iberia!"
 iberiawars.3.b:0 "Viva o Estado Novo!"
 
 iberiawars.301.t:0 "Chaos in Guinea"
 iberiawars.301.d:0 "The fight for independence has proven to be a strong rallying factor for the Portuguese both in the Iberian peninsular and further abroad. Troops stationed in former Portugal colonies such as Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau have also rejected the mantle of Iberian unity in favour of fighting for their old homeland. The regions are now under firm control with Unionist forces yet still unable to recapture them successfully. The former Portuguese empire is enjoying a resurgence despite the instability caused by the Iberian civil war\n\nOne exception, Sao Tome y Principe, where local forces felt compelled to fight the war on the frontlines instead of acting as a glorified garrison, has seen resistance to the re-establishment of Portuguese imperial control. Their abandonment of the colony has allowed native resistance cells to act more freely. The situation has given the PAIGC independence movement renewed strength in their previously futile mission. With their leaders sensing the opportunity as good as any to return from exile a bitter guerilla war has begun to be waged. "
 iberiawars.301.a:0 "This isn't good."
 
 iberiawars.302.t:0 "PAIGC Takes Over Guinea!" 
 iberiawars.302.d:0 "With the abandonment of Sao Tome y Principe by Portuguese military forces, the PAIGC have gained a strong foothold in the region. The expanding harsh guerilla campaign fought by the rebels has incentivised the Portuguese government to take action and also withdraw forces from Cabo Verde and Guinea-Bissau. To keep up the occupation would have required continuous resupply and troop reinforcement, something the newly independent country could not afford in its battle for survival on the Peninsula.\n\nSoon after their withdrawal the PAIGC militias entered Bisáu and Praia unopposed, seizing all important administrative and military buildings. It was not long before the rebels seized the initiative and broadcasted their supposed victory over the European colonisers, calling for all patriotic freedom fighters to celebrate their newfound independence. The loss has greatly damaged our prestige even if it was seen as a necessary move by most observers. Unfortunately some in the armed forces did not share this view and have heavily criticised the decision as an act of cowardice. This faction led by general Kaúlza de Arriaga has called for regaining the colonies at the first opportune moment. They have found support and allies in the north of our nation which is known to be a conservative hotbed. Far more worryingly some towns in the region have begun to plead alignment to a movement calling itself the 'Government of National Salvation' which seems to be acting as a direct challenger for authority in Portugal."
 iberiawars.302.a:0 "Disaster!" 

 A_SPRING.1.t:0 "Orungu Conquers Equatorial Guinea!"
 A_SPRING.1.d:0 "With the ever deteriorating situation on the Peninsula we have been forced to call upon all armed forces still loyal to the Union to fight on the front lines against the traitors. This has meant not just mobilising a large portion of the population but also recalling colonial garrisons.\n\nThe most experienced and willing soldiers in the Iberian holding of Equatorial Guinea have also been transported back to Europe, leaving only a meager unit to guard the colony. With the abandonment however came heightened tensions between the local population and the Iberian administration. It was not long before Orungu troops, who had offered their support to the independence revolt which had been brewing ever since Portugal had seceded,  entered the region and quickly forced the remaining colonial soldiers to retreat. Sensing that the situation was beyond repairable the Iberian mission completely abandoned Equatorial Guinea in favour of attempting to salvage the situation on the homefront."
 A_SPRING.1.a:0 "This isn't good."
 
 A_SPRING.2.t:0 "Sao Tomé Declares Independence!"
 A_SPRING.2.d:0 "In recent days the number of colonial disasters, which had been given life by the chronic instability on the Iberian peninsula, drastically increased. Nearly all holdings which still swore allegiance to the Union were seeing increased tensions with natives and calls for independence.\n\nThe Sao Tomé garrison had made it their calling to return to Iberia and fight for the sake of the dying dream. This however had allowed the opportunity for the freedom fighters which had previously been successfully suppressed to finally rise against those who they declared to be their oppressors. Under the name of the Sao Tome and Principe Liberation Movement or MLSTP for short the various native groups have come together and forced the remaining Iberian garrisons to surrender without much of  a violent confrontation. The guerillas then promptly entered the regional capital and to a jubilant civilian population publicly declared total independence from the Iberian Union."
 A_SPRING.2.a:0 "A less than ideal situation."
 
 iberiawars.4.t:0 "Arriaga's Failed Coup" 
 iberiawars.4.d:0 "Under the cover of darkness, a lone old military truck joined the convoys and the persistent businessmen on the long highway to Lisbon. Neither seeking profit in the late hours nor making its way to the front, it drove into the Portuguese capital with a single purpose.\n\nFollowing the unfortunate but necessary evacuation of Guinea in order to not get pushed into a protracted colonial conflict and to reinforce the Iberian front with hardened garrison soldiers, a military clique of disgruntled officers had formed. Under the leadership of Kaulza de Arriaga the conservative cabal was able to influence a number of towns in the north of the country to support the legitimacy of a new administration, the Government of National Salvation. Its mission was to wipe the stain of abandoning the Portuguese imperial holdings from the national consciousness, ensuring that every soldier and citizen could stand side by side pridefully to fight for a strong country. Loyalists to our regime have leaked plans of the clique to attempt to use their newfound support to successfully carry out a putsch. We also know exactly when they plan to execute their mission.\n\nThe driver gasped in surprise and turned quickly to his passengers. Pointing ahead to the side of the road all could see the two tanks and a large number of military personnel checking each lone passerby. With an angry grumble a man at the back of the truck waved for the driver to turn around. 'Let them have it this way,' he thought. 'Portugal and its soul could have been saved with minimal bloodshed.'"
 iberiawars.4.a:0 "Traitors!" 
 iberiawars.4.b:0 "We shall save the nation!"
 
 iberiawars.5.t:0 "Morocco Demands Freedom"
 iberiawars.5.d:0 "Amidst the chaos arising in Iberia proper, our African colonies have been bursting at the seams with opportunistic revolutionaries. Many are calling for the so-called "liberation" of what they perceive as their rightful lands. No doubt, their true goal is to destroy everything we've spent decades building and return to their former barbarous ways.\n\nHowever, many of the more sane amongst them still recognize that a full  and immediate break from our influence may prove detrimental to their weak, fledgling state. Indeed, without our control, they may lack the necessary defences to resist other foreign powers. Few want to escape from the frying pan should it mean landing in the fire.\n\nUnderstanding this, Hassan II of Morocco has given us an offer: recognize Morocco's independence and gain an ally, or refuse recognition and remain alone against the revolutionary onslaught.\n\nShould we recognize Morocco, we would gain an immediate ally and prevent the opening of yet another front in this already straining war. However, it is unlikely that this alliance would last long past this conflict's resolution, meaning we'd be deprived of direct access to the nation's industry and resources going forward.\n\nEven still, a war with Morocco would be unwinnable in our current state. Our ability to reconquer the traitorous Moroccan state would hinge entirely on our ability to win the ongoing conflict in Iberia proper, which would be much easier with aid from Morocco.\n\nUltimately, after much deliberation, we've concluded that..."

 #to be honest you can make all these morocco events pretty short and ez, p much nobody will see them really
 iberiawars.501.t:0 "Iberia Recognizes Moroccan Independence"
 iberiawars.501.d:0 "We've received word that the Iberian government has accepted our request for independence. While this came as a shock some, King Hasan II was wholly assured that the Iberians would not waste any effort fighting a near unwinnable war in North Africa when their situation at home is so dire.\n\nWith our independence secured, we may now shift our attention to other pressing matters both domestic and abroad. Chief among these are supporting the Iberians in their war effort and securing our newly gained territories.\n\nProviding the Iberians with aid should prove simple enough as, at least for now, the frontlines are far from the heart of Morocco. This should mean producing weapons, equipment, and supplies will be to no detriment of our own. Of course, transporting these goods securely is another ordeal, but with proper planning it is certainly doable.\n\nSecuring our new territories may prove much more difficult. The edges of our kingdom still remain engulfed in conflict, and many are dissatisfied with our government's collaboration with the Iberian State. As it stands our military is unprepared to deal with an organized insurgency, so the best we can do is prepare and hope beyond hope that the situation does not escalate.\n\nRegardless of these issues, now is a time of celebration for the Moroccan people, as we once more taste true freedom after countless years of subjugation."
 iberiawars.501.a:0 "Tremendous news!"
 
 iberiawars.5011.t:0 "Rif Republic Rises Up"
 iberiawars.5011.d:0 "It would seem that even Morocco will not be spared from the mayhem of the Iberian Wars, as after weeks of regional turmoil, the Rif Republic has formally announced their secession from Morocco.\n\nThis declaration comes mere weeks after the kingdom itself was granted independence, and seems to be a response to our government's collaboration with our former colonial masters, specifically targeting Hasan II involvement in the affair. Taking inspiration from the anti-spanish and pro-republican sentiments brought about in the initial Rif uprising decades prior, these radicals seek an immediate break from all Iberian influence as well  as the abolition of Morocco's long standing monarchy.\n\nThough territorially small in comparison to Morocco proper, the Rif rebels hold key Moroccan port cities as well as a relatively large population given their land area, not to mention that they represent an increasingly popular idea within our own borders. These insurgents are not to be underestimated, and must be dealt with swiftly."
 iberiawars.5011.a:0 "Traitors!"
 iberiawars.5011.b:0 "For the Republic!"

 iberiawars.5021.t:0 "Trarza Breaks Off" #dont bother with loc first release
 iberiawars.5021.d:0 "(this event is for morocco, after iberia declared war on them. why dont they wanna be moroccan with us"
 iberiawars.5021.a:0 "(Play as Morocco)"
 iberiawars.5021.b:0 "(Play as Trarza)"
 
 iberiawars.5012.t:0 "Trarza Invades!" 
 iberiawars.5012.d:0 "The Iberian instability has left a terrible power vacuum in the North-African regions formerly under the European colonisers sphere of influence. Local populations have seized the opportunity to attempt a project of self-governance to varying degrees of success. Conflict however never stays too far away given the circumstances.\n\nWe have gained reports form the southern reaches of our nation that a group of insurgents was occupying towns and villages, seizing goods and in general terrorising the local population. From the seemingly reliable information we have it seems that Mauritian nationalist guerillas are attempting to break away the south of our nation in order to unify it with Mauritania Proper. In their mission they have invited further troops from Trarza and have now become a serious threat to our national security. Bloodshed is inevitable."
 iberiawars.5012.a:0 "This is our land!"
 iberiawars.5012.b:0 "We fight for our freedom!"

 iberiawars.502.t:0 "Iberia Declares War!" 
 iberiawars.502.d:0 "The lone man blissfully looked out onto the peaceful waters of the Meditterenean. Leaning back against a crumbling sand dune he shifted his gaze momentarily up at the clear blue sky, watching as a group of hungry seagulls were fighting over a caught fish. Suddenly the screeching birds were drowned out by a loud metallic boom. The man jolted upwards and with wide eyes observed a large squadron of military vessels near the coastline, seemingly on the course for the port of the nearby town he was from. Jumping up he dashed as fast as his legs could carry him. As despite the distance he had been able to spot the flags which adorned the coming ships.\n\nWith some of the instability on the peninsula resolved the Iberian administration had publicly asserted their will to regain the previously lost territory. In particular the colonies in North Africa were vitally important to restore the prestige lost by the civil war. Morocco was on the top of that list and now the Arab nation was in the sights of the rejuvenated Iberian military force. " 
 iberiawars.502.a:0 "Colonizers!"
 
 iberiawars.6.t:0 "Catalonia Revolts"
 iberiawars.6.d:0 "Chaos has spread like a ravenous disease all throughout the Iberian peninsula. Wherever tensions, ethnic or otherwise, had previously taken root, there now were strong explosions of violence and insurrection. The stability which the Union had held onto was shattered, possibly beyond repair.\n\nThe Basque uprising, the first domino in an ever increasing chain reaction, seemingly has motivated other nationalists in the north of our country to also take advantage of the terrible situation. We have gained reports from Barcelona and other Catalan cities that the independence of a new Catalonian republic has been proclaimed. The revolt could have been quickly quelled had our forces stationed in the region still been present and not shifted around to the various new frontlines which had opened up across the peninsula. Some of our divisions had remained yet they seemingly were caught in the intense fervour and have joined the Catalonian independence cause.\n\nAdditionally we now know that the republic is being led by the former Generalitat-in-exile Josep Tarradellas. The troublemaker quickly had returned from abroad to form a new government which would support the revolt. Unless we intervene and return the rule of law to the region this could seriously hamper our war efforts against the other traitors."
 iberiawars.6.a:0 "Viva Iberia!"
 iberiawars.6.b:0 "Visca Catalunya!" 

 iberiawars.7.t:0 "Galicia Declares Neutrality"
 iberiawars.7.d:0 "As the chaos continues to spread throughout the peninsula we have received reports of a new actor entering the stage. One of the tanks brigades we had dispatched to subdue the Portuegese revolt was stopped by local soldiers in Galicia. When our soldiers demanded to be let through they were instead arrested, apparently on the orders of the various Galician governors. Shortly afterwards Galicia blocked access to all roads to and from their provinces. Given the rapidly escalating tensions it was perhaps not surprising that the next proclamation to arrive from Santiago was a claim that the interests of Galicia no longer align with those of Madrid and that the only logical course of action was independence.\n\nThe secession of Galicia puts us in a tough spot. While their treachery can not be abided, our resources are already stretched to their breaking point. We can ill afford to open another frontline at this juncture. Luckily it seems like the Galician government is content to remain within their borders. For the time being we will have to accept their de-facto independence and only return after the current crisis has been handled."
 iberiawars.7.a:0 "It is the prudent thing to do."
 iberiawars.7.b:0 "Free from the tyrants at last." 
 
 iberiawars.8.t:0 "Reformists Protest"
 iberiawars.8.d:0 "The current crisis has become too unsavoury for certain factions within the Iberian administration. Our use of violence to quash the open treason displayed by protestors and independence groups was entirely legitimated through the machination of the state. Some however, prominent members of the reformists within the government, are calling for a different approach with the rebels. An outcry against what has been dubbed a shoot first and think later policy is hampering government action on the daily as the reformists have taken to badger as many responsible officials as possible.\n\nWe cannot however take their suggestions seriously no matter the outcome. The suggested peacefully negotiated outcome would be detrimental to the territorial integrity and legitimacy of the Iberian state, something it truly may not be able to recover from. What they have called work towards a 'more free and fair Iberia' hence really just sounds like more treasonous doubt in the government."
 iberiawars.8.a:0 "Worrying..."
 
 
#(The gist of all these Republican events is that after the reformist demands are ignored, they decide to form a rival government in the south of Spain, that is sympathetic to this cause, as well as invite back prominent exiled politicians with the intent of forming a democratic united front against the federal government. The only difference between the events is the territorial size of the faction.) 

####Please just change literally just a few words. The events should be completely identical except a few tiny words
 
 iberiawars.801.t:0 "The Spanish Republic Splits" 
 iberiawars.801.d:0 "With various factions leaving the government to start uprisings or sow discord in a similar fashion to the treasonous independence fighters, the Iberian government has consequently been left as a rump administration. This rump was however not just characterised by only those loyal to the regime or the Iberian dream, it also featured prominent liberla and reformist politicians. Their calls for a peaceful solution to the ever growing conflict, despite the growing influence, has entirely fallen on death ears. With the accompanying loss of stability the reformers have begun to entirely lose their faith in fruitful Iberian governance.\n\nIn light of this a number of the politicians have drawn parallels to the Portuguese revolt as a sustainable path to divorce from this mess. Rising to fight for better and more durable ideals than what the current administration wobbles on has to be the only choice. Once the initial plans were set in place intelligence had to be gathered on the level of support a new regime on Spanish would hold. For the reformers the findings were not favourable in the slightest. It has been found that the level of democratic ideology in the nation has not increased in the slightest even with the abundance of crisis that authoritarianism was facing. No matter, a better opportunity will not be revealed!"

While they failed to seize complete power they did manage to install themselves as rulers of the North.

Soldiers loyal to him have seized the government and put Milands del Bosch for botching what was supposed to have been a short but glorious conquest. Arrese has promised his followers a new radical leadership, one which shall crush the pretenders and create a bold new Spanish state.

Desperate for any source of legitimacy the conservatives have offered up a radical proposal, restoring the monarchy by offering the throne to Juan de Borbón. While the liberals have accepted the proposal, albeit with less enthusiasm and the socialists are outraged.

Under the leadership of Sabino Fernández Campo a group of generals have couped the government. Arguing that civilian leadership is fundamentally unsuited for the kind of conflict we are engaged in, the generals have enacted a variety of harsh measures to solidify their rule. Curfews, the abolishment of town halls and the enforcement of military governors and state control over the industry are merely some of the measures enacted. While conservative politicians have voiced cautious support for this development the liberals are clearly worried. Worst off however are the socialists.

However as the war drags on our relationship with them has grown more and more strained. Thinking our leadership weak and inefficient Socialist politicians have been gradually withdrawing from our government. When we received yet another report of a loss on the frontline that was the last straw. Organizing themselves into the "Catalonian People's Army" the socialists tried to seize control of the state.
