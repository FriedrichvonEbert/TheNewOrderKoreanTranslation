 POLITICS_REICHSKOMMISSAR_JOSIAS_DESC:0 "발데크 운트 피어몬트 세습공 요지아스는 권력과 귀족층 안에서 자랐으나, 독일 공화국이 선포될 당시 가문의 귀족 작위와 특권의 박탈을 막기엔 무력했습니다. 1920년대 후반 나치당에 입당한 요지아스는 재빨리 SS의 편에 서며 안정적인 승진을 거듭했습니다. 요지아스는 곧 법문을 향한 꼼꼼하고 열렬한 헌신으로 명성을 얻었으며, 부헨발트 수용소장 카를-오토 코흐를 공금횡령 혐의로 기소하기도 했습니다. 서러시아 전쟁이 가까워질 당시 요지아스는 한직인 바르테란트 SS 상급경찰청장으로 재직하며, 힘러의 실패한 SS 정변에 관한 의심에서 벗어나있었습니다. 자신의 명성을 확고히 하는 동시에 라이히의 동부 경계에서 힘러의 눈과 귀가 되고자, 요지아스는 공개적으로 SS를 부정하고 자신의 회원증을 찢어버리는 거짓 다툼을 일으켰습니다.\n\n카우카지엔 국가판무관부가 유격대에 시달리며 새 국가판무관을 필요로 한다는 사실이 알려졌을 때, 훌륭한 업무기록과 진실된 명성을 가진 요지아스가 총통을 설득하기란 어려운 일이 아니었습니다. 그러나 티플리스에 도착한 지 1주도 되기 전, 자캅카스 소비에트 유격대 일파에게 생포당한 요지아스는 사흘에 걸쳐 잔혹하게 고문받았습니다. 요지아스는 자신이 당한 그 모든 고통을, 그 모습을 지켜본 그 모든 얼굴을 기억했습니다. 마침내 구출되고 나자, 요지아스는 "안정화"를 위한 자신의 계획을 꺼내들었습니다. 고속도로와 도시들은 요새화되고, 원주민들은 강제이주당했으며, 비협조적 지역들은 무차별적인 소이탄 폭격을 맞았습니다. 더불어 요지아스는 관료체계와 주둔군을 충성스러운 SS 일원들로 채우며, 은밀히 SS에 재입했습니다. (다만, 그는 본래의 자신의 회원번호를 되찾지 못한 것을 모욕으로 받아들이고 있습니다.) 여전히 할당량에 맞추어 게르마니아로 자원을 보내는 그를 비난하는 목소리는 없지만, 여전히 혹자들은 요지아스가 진정으로 떠받드는 명령이 오스트파리에서 오는 것이라 여기고 있습니다."
 
 POLITICS_KAISER_JOSIAS_DESC:0 "Josias, Erbprinz zu Waldeck und Pyrmont, found himself utterly alone. He had cut off his ties with the SS after feeling slighted by Himmler, he had refused to aid any of the so-called Führers at each others' throats in the Reich, he had alienated the industrialists for frequently trying to exact greater and greater taxes upon their mines and refineries, and the damnable natives would never accept a foreigner ruling over their lands. There was only one thing Josias had left to turn to: his noble heritage.\n\nThe idea was dismissed as madness, both by his family and his closest advisors. An absolute monarch in the twentieth century? What an absurd fantasy! But to Josias, it seemed that there were few other options. Monarchs could rule multi-ethnic states with more ease than military dictators, let alone National Socialists. After all, had the Habsburgs not managed to hold together a cosmopolitan Empire in the heart of Europe for five hundred years? And thus, he ordered it to be done. A crown was crafted, a date was set, a cathedral was chosen, a bishop was found, and a large swathe of the bureaucracy and military who spoke out against it were quietly purged from the government.\n\nNow, the Reichskommissar's official title is His Majesty Josias I, King of Kaukasia, Protector of Kuban, and Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He wears elaborate uniforms, holds court at his palace in Katharinastadt, and hears the petitions of regional governors who must bow before his throne. Although some call it madness, there is method to it: he has taken his duties as a monarch just as seriously as he did as a Nazi, and he seems to have little intent of relaxing oppression against the natives."
 
 POLITICS_PAUL_PLEIGER_DESC:0 "Although Reichskommissariat Kaukasien may have been created as a way to test limited autonomy for collaborating minorities, its continued existence has always been to serve one purpose: to wring every drop of oil and pry every ounce of precious metals from the earth. To ensure this end, the upper echelons of the Reichskommissariat's bureaucracy was filled with mining magnates, oil barons, and other industrialists who would have a very personal interest in maximizing operations. The undisputed leader of this corporate clique is Paul Pleiger, who previously ran prestigious industrial operations like the Reichswerke Hermann Göring.\n\nWhile Pleiger and his ilk have been content to take a backseat while the Reichskommissars kept the natives in line, Josias's recent... eccentricities have convinced him that actions must be taken to keep the Reichskommissariat's primary mission active. Now that cooler heads have prevailed, Pleiger hopes that he and his fellow industrialists are able to keep things steady, keep the oil flowing back to the Vaterland, and keep their many investments profitable for the rest of their lives. Pleiger also has decades of experience in expropriating property from liberated territories, and many in both Katharinastadt and Germania are confident that he can deal with this pesky native problem that not even Josias's heavy-handedness could crush. All he needs is a few years of stability and steady funding, he insists, and everything will settle into a happy status quo that will benefit everyone (and their portfolios)."
 
 POLITICS_HERBERT_BACKE_DESC:0 "Reichskommissar Josias has, unfortunately, met his end. Slain by a cerebral hemorrhage in his sleep, the responsibility of ruling now falls to his loyal lieutenant, Herbert Backe.\n\nBacke was born in Georgia to German immigrant parents in the final decade of the Russian Empire. When the war came, young Herbert and his family were viewed as enemy aliens and imprisoned, not escaping Russia until the Civil War broke out. These experiences generated a deep loathing in Backe for Russians, Germanophobes, and most importantly, communists.\n\nSafely in Germany, Backe became an agronomist, and quickly found political kinship in the rising Nazi Party. He climbed the SS bureaucracy, making a name for himself in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. It was in here where he developed what would later be dubbed the Hunger Plan: the weaponization of agriculture and logistics to keep Germans fed at Slavs' expense, leading to genocide through systematic starvation. When Backe finally ascended to the rank of Minister for Food and Agriculture, he was able to implement his plan with impunity across the Reich's eastern conquests. The blood of millions was on his hands, a price he would gladly claim without remorse.\n\nBacke's position was secure until Himmler's failed coup, casting a shadow of distrust across all high-ranking SS members. Backe refused to renounce his SS membership and was unceremoniously demoted, serving instead as Minister of the Interior for Reichskommissar Josias zu Waldeck und Pyrmont of Kaukasien.\n\nBut once again, Herbert climbed the ranks, gaining his Reichskommissar's trust and ousting his rivals. And he has no intention of relaxing his predecessor's scorched earth policy toward the partisans that plague his Reichskommissariat."
 
 POLITICS_WITTEKIND_DESC:0 "Wittekind Adolf Heinrich Georg-Wilhelm zu Waldeck and Pyrmont has been surrounded by the Nazi elite literally since the day he was born: his godfathers were Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. And as one would expect of any scion to a Nazi nobleman, his father made sure to intellectually and ideologically groom him as his successor. He was sent to an SS-Junkerschüle and trained to be an SS officer, where by all accounts he was a rather bright student. However, he was far more interested in economics and finance than politics or military strategy, so his father reluctantly bade him to go and study business administration in Frankfurt. It was his studies that spared him from having to see frontline combat in the West Russian War, and kept him safely out of suspicion when Himmler attempted his putsch.\n\nWhen his studies were finished, Wittekind departed not to his family estate in Hesse, but to his father's administrative headquarters in Katharinastadt. Here, it was once again that Josias began grooming his son for leadership, but of a far different kind than before: monarchy. Wittekind stayed quiet when his father announced his royal ambitions, believing it to be a practical joke or desperate cry for international attention that would soon be abandoned. But Josias refused to drop the charade, staying fully committed to his role as King of Kaukasia until the day he died.\n\nNow, Wittekind wears a crown he does not want atop a throne he despises in a country he wants nothing more than to abandon forever. But flight is no longer an option. And with the land around him rapidly descending into chaos, King Witteking I will have no option but to fight for his life."
 
 POLITICS_KAUKASIEN_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "The natives of the Caucasus, having grown furious at the German boot on their necks, have risen up in the chaos following the feared Reichskommissar Josias's death. His successor Herbert Backe soon joined him, though thanks to a car bomb instead of a stroke. The surviving members of House Waldeck and Pyrmont have fled the country, and no SS man is willing to step up and fill the power vacuum for fear of making himself a target for partisans.\n\nOutside of the capital of Katharinastadt, the Reichskommissariat is in chaos. Patrols along the roads have stopped, refineries burn, mines are collapsed, and the guards of fortified German enclave towns desperately try to hold off wave after wave of natives eager to exact revenge for twenty-five years of oppression. Numerous groups, whether they are small bands of villagers, defecting collaborators, or entire shadow governments, have come out of hiding and proclaimed their independence from their German overlords. And with nobody in the German hierarchy willing to take the helm, it is likely to stay that way."

 ### Ideas ###
 CAU_tiflis_three:0 "Memories of the Tiflis Three"
 CAU_tiflis_three_desc:0 "The Tiflis Three were the leaders of the Transcaucasian Soviet, a partisan group who launched an organized uprising during the West Russian War. They were captured and publicly hanged in 1961, but much to the Reichskommissar's consternation, the natives have turned them into martyrs and lionized their cause."
 CAU_bergbaureich:0 "Das Bergbaureich"
 CAU_bergbaureich_desc:0 "Kaukasien is renowned not for its land, but for what lies beneath it. The earth offers up endless rivers of oil and tons upon tons of metals and minerals, and the German occupiers partake deeply and greedily in the bounty."
 CAU_shipments_to_ger:0 "Shipments to the Reich"
 CAU_shipments_to_ger_desc:0 "While Ukraine may be the breadbasket of the Reich, Kaukasien is its gas tank. Its oil industry solely exists to serve the Reich's needs and operates on orders from Germania, so it is only natural that everything it pumps from the earth is sent to the Reich to use as they please."
 CAU_stratified:0 "A Stratified Society"
 CAU_stratified_desc:0 "A hierarchy of sorts has arisen in the Reichskommissariat. At the bottom are the "three loathsome pests," Georgians, Armenians, and Circassians, all loathed by the Germans for their continued rebelliousness. Above them are the other ethnic minorities, only slightly less disdained. Then come the German skilled laborers and their families, and on top sit the bureaucracy and army, thoroughly dominated by Josias's men."
 CAU_stratified_less:0 "Slipping Stratification"
 CAU_stratified_less_desc:0 "As time goes on, it seems that there are more opportunities for non-Aryans in the Reichskommissariat's society. Where one may have only once found German engineers and bureaucrats, there is occasionally an Avar or a Chechen pushing pencils. While these advancements are still meager, some take it as a sign that minorities may learn to live peacefully under the Reich's close watch."

 cau.1.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Kaukasien: The Black State"
 cau.1.desc:0 "Although a de jure part of the Großgermanisches Reich, Hitler's influence over Reichskommissariat Kaukasien is only nominal. The man who truly holds power is Josias Georg Wilhelm Adolf, Hereditary Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. That title once belonged to the incompetent fool Arno Schickedanz. When the West Russian War broke out and the partisans rose up, Schickedanz ate a bullet rather than face the courts for his incompetence. His successor, Hermann Neubacher, took a limp-wristed attempt at appeasing the natives, who repaid him by shooting down his helicopter.\n\nThe lessons Josias took from his predecessors, as well as three days of torture at partisans' hands, was that an occupier having sympathy for the occupied will always result in their downfall. The only way to ensure order is through the vigorous suppression of any and all dissent. But Josias's obsessive quest to crush the natives has also led to some ideological compromises: he is a dutiful follower of Himmler's Burgundian system, but many below him are oil barons, industrialists, and other businessmen who don't give a damn about Josias's lunatic SS cult as long as the crude keeps flowing. They oppose wholesale native extermination not out of the goodness of their hearts, but because they're a labor pool that can fill far more dangerous positions and be paid far less than Germans.\n\nHardly anyone is allowed to visit Kaukasien outside of official Reich business, though there is hardly anything worth visiting anyway. Outside of the nice neighborhoods where the German workers live, there are sprawling ghettos, smog-choked industrial parks, and landscapes scorched by Josias's "pacifications." Josias is also fiercely protective of his borders, to the point where some say that he is masterminding plots away from Germania's prying eyes."

 cau.2.t:0 "Death of a Diplomat"
 cau.2.desc:0 "The German diplomat to Kaukasus was found murdered today, gunned down in his apartment sometime last night. The ambassador, who had arrived in Kaukasus earlier this week to discuss the situation of the Reichskommissariat's increasing drift from the Reich, had come unannounced to the German settlers, a move which many predicted had relation to the murder. Germany, is, of course, in shock at the move, but Kaukasian authorities have been quick to begin covering up the investigation, blaming local rebels for murdering the ambassador as a show of force, and have rebuked all attempts by German authorities to investigate the matter.\n\nThis move has solidify the souring relations between the two, but with the Reich in chaos, it seems there is little means to correct this right now."
 cau.2.a:0 "We do not appreciate... unannounced visitors."
 
 cau.3.t:0 "The Ballet of the Masses"
 cau.3.desc:0 "Football remains a cherished tradition tradition of those in the Reichskommissariat, even as it carries the stigma of being the darkest and most secretive of the many German colonies.\n\nNaturally, the Kaukasian-German team was set to win this years national championship, as they have done every year, but instead a shocking defeat was handed to them by the Georgia national despite us making it very clear to them that they were to lose to the superior team. The Georgians claim to have won in solidarity with their brothers and sisters being 'unfairly treated' by the German authorities.\n\nThe situation has been... rectified, and hopefully the Georgian team's replacements will be more prudent next year."

Already expeditions are being prepared for Tibet and Western Anatolia."

 cau.788.desc:0 "A surprisingly disappointed looking expedition leader for the Kaukasian's in Turkey (investigating their laughably called 'Aryan Super City') has announced that the find was, in fact, not evidence of ancient Aryans colonizing Europe. Instead they have announced after the finding of multiple ancient Roman artifacts that they may have found the location of the infamous lost Roman Legion, the Legio IX - Hispania.\n\nWhile this has sparked much interest from the international community, especially as the Kaukasian's then proved their findings with footage of them unearthing several ancient shields, bits of armor, weapons, and several skeletons. The Kaukasians however have been humiliated in the eyes of the international community, and the expedition has gotten far less boisterous in their proclamations of their finds. It seems whatever comes of this expedition from here on out will be far less exciting for them, and word has already come that an angered Josias will possibly be scrapping the dig."

 cau.789.t:0 "An Ancient Calling"
 cau.789.desc:0 "Obergruppenführer Baader, the leader of our now failing Turkish expedition, has sent some strange news. He reports that the archeologists and their guards have reported strange nightmares and dreams, and several have come down with what seems like some form of radiation sickness. They have already procured radiation suits, but their Geiger counters have yet to actually find any sort of radiation poisoning the dig. Instead, they report something much stranger.\n\nBaader claims that while doing regular radio checks, they discovered a strange noise coming over one of the unused frequencies. With further investigation, they found that there is some sort of... signal, or a force, as Baader calls it, coming from somewhere in the site. Baader has already moved forward  on investigating this without prompting, but *has* asked for permission to try and create a form of antenna for this strange force. He believes, that with the proper funding and of course, our support, he could potentially focus this energy into one spot.\n\nThe expedition has begun to get out of hand, but who knows what revelation we can make?"
 cau.789.a:0 "He has our blessing, surely the results shall be interesting."
 cau.789.b:0 "Shut down the expedition, this has been enough of a waste."
 
 cau.790.t:0 "Interlopers"
 cau.790.desc:0 "The Kaukasian dig had been nothing if not controversial, and had gained a permanent garrison of protesters, news commentators, and local police watching the ever-growing amount of soldiers and scientists the Kaukasians have sent to investigate their finds. The most peculiar finding had been what seemed to be a sort of radio antenna that had slowly been erected in the center of the sight, bringing many questions that the international community had been unable to answer.\n\nAnd now it's all gone.\n\nFootage showed the Kaukasians gathering around the antenna, one man flicking a switch. At first, nothing of peculiarity happened, most of the Kaukasians even seemed to be growing bored.\n\nThen, it was like there had been a thunder clap. The sky darkened, the sun seemed to set despite it being the middle of the afternoon, and the entire expedition seemed to disappear.\n\nOver the crater a glowing, swirling vortex of energy sat, and from it spewed... Romans. As if they were the legions of old, hundreds of soldiers came out of this vortex, armed with what appeared to be, of all things, machine guns, rifles, tanks and other armaments. Gunshots were soon heard as these strange visitors opened fire on the remaining members of the expedition, and then at those civilians who had not already begun to ran.\n\nReports are saying that the Turkish military has already begun to engage, and that they are losing."
 cau.790.a:0 "W-what?"
