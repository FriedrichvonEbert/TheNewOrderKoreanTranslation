POLITICS_MCW_SIEGFRIED_KASCHE_DESC:0 "Better the dream not achieved than the one that is twisted, corrupted, and deformed.\n\nSiegfried Kasche had always had one dream. It was always clear and un-compromised - the Reich shall bathe in glory and blood of each and every soul that tried to oppose it - the communists, the degenerates, the Untermensch, the traitors, and the ones who thought that the National Socialist triumph was not possible.\n\nThe dream became twisted.\n\nDespite loyally serving the NSDAP since its inception, despite serving in the Slavic lands - places no Germans should ever find itself needing to touch - on its behalf, despite assuming the title of the Reichskommissar of Moskowien, all his dream did was to lock him down in a prison with keys from it leading to nowhere.\n\nYes, the Slav is enslaved by all the means - from factories to farms. Yes, the Slav is afraid to look up to see the light as there will always be a whip by his back. Yes, the Slavs have degenerated into betraying each other whenever the Eagle wishes - at least in Kasche's mind.\n\nBut this is not enough. And it will never be. The future of Kasche, of Moskowien and its history is locked and can only be changed if the whole prison is destroyed - by the wishes of Destiny or against them."

Noble heritage, military service, one position, another position - the sun's light was still before him, it still showed him the road to the top, the glory that would surpass his death and leave him in history, the riches which he could not predict or comprehend.\n\nIf only he did not waste the time he was given.\n\nLong after being appointed as the key deputy to Kasche in Moskowien, Helldorff could not find a road he could see so clearly long ago. He became, like all the others, the prisoner of Moskowien. This was the end of his road.\n\nWhat was looking like the climbing of the mountain before now looks like being forced to slide in a constant downhill - with all his power, money and connections it is now much more bearable to exist each passing day but, however, the direction of this road looks nothing like the glory, nothing like the deserved recognition. What it leads to is a mess.\n\nThe irrepressible parasites are, in a way, beneficial to the system - its host, however, will always regret not eradicating it when he had a chance.§!"

Bronislav Vladislavovich Kaminski is aware of how this happens, yet he himself became friends with the Devil.\n\nThe son of Belorussia, Kaminski always has dreamed of something greater than himself, his family or his country. It was the idea that made him join the Red Army, it was the idea that locked him up in the cell in Siberia and later on sent to Lokot, and it was the idea which put the corpses of tens of thousands onto his hands. He gladly carries around the dead, smelling the dead peoples' ended opposition to his idea - and asks for more, more and more. For something so simple, yet so grand.\n\nAmong this smell is the oldest smell of them all - of Voskoboinik. His corrupted face is long underneath the face of the Earth, yet Kaminski still walks.\n\n"You will be avenged. For Novaya Rossiya. For you. And for myself."§!"

His place in the Reich earned by the family he took no part in, his power and wealth achieved not by him. From his position Quandt looks on the ones who gave him what he owns, on their graves and ended tales.\n\nSo be it.\n\nSo let them work, so let them lay dead. When the mundane hammering of factories stops, when the list of documents to sign ends, when the day is all but over he looks back at his past and...\n\nHe does not feel regret.\n\nWhat for the people is a prison, what for them seems like a God's punishment and what for them seems like an endless river of blood, war and misery for Quandt is just another chance to climb up higher through his mountains of gold and the Destiny's blessing.§!"

The sound of bullets, now engraved in his mind, reminds of all the fallen, of all the ones whose deaths he was responsible for.\n\nFirst he served the Motherland he knew, the Motherland he loved. Then he saw his Motherland beaten, humiliated and confused. After that She came to ask for his service again - with blood on Her hands, with a Brown Mob so foreign to him commanding Her every move.\n\nHe could not betray her, no matter how she looked.\n\nShe awarded him for defending her in all the wars She has faced. And, seemingly, God has awarded him for refusing to get down on the level of a Brown Mob when dealing with the enemies on the frontlines and his fellow soldiers - now, von Saucken looks above the battlefields he and his men fought so hard to protect their Motherland, chained to a Swastika with thousands of people being just the same. When he looks over the horizon, when sees what the future may look like, he asks himself one question.\n\n"Will it be enough?"§!"

This is what Moskowien was to become.\n\nThis is what Generalplan Moskowien tried to achieve. Forcing the Slav to work himself to death, collaborate and obey while his Masters replace him - all for the Dream, all for the final Triumph.\n\nHow foolish these plans were."

It was dug out of the bottomless pit of destruction and degeneracy by the new hero of National Socialism - Siegfried Kasche.

It is a governing tool created by Siegfried Kasce's Totalrekonstruktion, aimed at encouraging the collaborator activity and solidifying the political system into one body, throughoutly centralised and controlled around its Reichskommissar and the AoDNSDAP. The Ostvolkrat serves as the cheif executive and planning body of Moskowien, starting and enacting its Reichsgezetzes, controlling every aspect of life of every significant group of influence in Moskowien - Fraktions - KVM, UM, OKM, NSPR and SNS.\n\nIt is, however, filled with traitors. Their faces are hardly known, as their motives are, but every single day somewhere, somehow, they betray the AoDNSDAP, Moskowien, their own future, the safety of the Aryan race and Destiny herself.\n\nEither their days are numbered - or ours."
