 #TNO_OPENING_DESC:0 "Welcome to The New Order: Old World Blues! Old World Blues is a demo for The New Order: Last Days of Europe and much smaller in scope than the released mod will be. In this demo, you will be able to fully enjoy four nations: The noble Ural League, the proud communes of Orenburg, the foul bandits of the Dirlewanger Brigade, and the ever-plotting Lysenko of Magnitogorsk.\n\nYou will find these nations fully playable for a bit over five years, primarily for the duration that they are all killing one another. The New Order does not play like many other mods, and is as a narrative experience as much as it is a gameplay one, though you will find the Southern Urals to be fairly gameplay driven regardless.\n\nAll other nations in the mod have had their content removed for the purposes of this demo. However, you will notice the world still changing as the demo progress, giving you hints at what else is to come!\n\nIf you are interested in the mod and like what you see here, please like and favorite the mod, and check us out on social media! You can find links to our Discord, Reddit, and several other sites on the main menu, as well from our Steam page.\n\nThe New Order has been created due to the tireless efforts of numerous developers, contributors, artists, writers, moderators, and a plucky composer. I started this mod over five years ago now, originally for Victoria 2, and it was a very different mod then. Now, for almost two years, me and my team have tirelessly been turning The New Order from a little pet project into something we can all truly be proud of. Over two hundred people have at some point contributed to our project, not counting the numerous donations of work and time given to us by our friends in the HOI4 Modding Coop and beyond, an organization I helped found and am proud to stand by to this day.\n\nWe have faced numerous challenges, but have been blessed with a community that has stood with us through it all. For their patience, dedication, and love, we wanted to reward them and give something back. To our beautiful community, this is for you. Thank you all so much. We are humbled every day just thinking of the great expectations and the amazing support you have given us.\n\nThank you everyone, and please enjoy the demo! There is so much more to come from us, and we hope you will be there along the ride!\n\n~ThePinkPanzer, Lead Developer.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 COUNTRY_INFO_VYATKA: "§G==뱟카 공국==§!\n\nThe near-total collapse of Soviet authority in the wake of the West Russian War has, over the years, resulted in all manner of ambitious warlords rising through the ashes and staking their claim to Russia. One such group is a ghost from Russia's turbulent past: the remnants of the Romanov dynasty led by §WVladimir III§! and his allies.\n\nDuring the West Russian War, the hard-pressed German forces allowed a division of European émigrés loyal to the exiled §WVladimir Kirillovich§! to join the fight against the resurgent §RRed Army§!, where they would play a key role in a desperate Wehrmacht offensive. Although the Germans were eventually forced to withdraw, the monarchists pushed on regardless, and were able to establish a permanent foothold in §WVyatka§!. Now §WVladimir III§! and the émigré cliques oversee the strongest bastion of monarchism in Russia. That being said, §WVyatka§! is beginning to face internal divisions. The émigré cliques bicker amongst themselves and compete for political dominance, while the antiquated bureaucracy of the §WPrincipality§! continues to cause problems as time marches on. The Okhrana, the §WPrincipality's§! secret police led by Boris Smyslovsky, has so far been successful in ensuring stability for the regime, but the question of how much power they should wield remains. These issues will need to be addressed before any serious plans for reclamation can begin.\n\nInternally, the §WPrincipality§! is divided between three émigré cliques of equal import. Firstly are the Constitutional Democrats, led by the émigré §WRoman Gul§!, who represent the liberals. They wish to create a functioning constitutional monarchy, complete with guaranteed rights for minorities. Secondly, the Solidarists led by §WAleksandr Solzhenitsyn§! are staunch nationalists with some authoritarian tendencies. That being said, they still wish for some degree of reform from the antiquated systems of yesteryear. Finally, there is §WVasily Shulgin's§! faction, the All-Russian National Union. §WShulgin§! is a politician of the old school, with a history of service dating back to the days of Tsar Nicholas II. Like the liberals, he favors constitutionalism as well, but does not wish to disrupt the traditions of the old Empire.\n\nExternally, §WVyatka§! is surrounded by potential threats. To the southeast, the madmen of the §RAryan Brotherhood§! serve as the most pressing threat. In the north, the unstable §RRepublic of Komi§! is unpredictable and should be carefully monitored, while the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! stirs. If §WVyatka§! is to unite Russia, conflict with them is inevitable. Meanwhile, raids from the §RTatar§! and §RBashkir§! warlords to the west and south are common but are unlikely to escalate into a full-blown conflict for now. Further to the southwest, however, is §RAndrey Vlasov§! and the so-called §RRussian Liberation Army§! based in §RSamara§!. Unlike the §RTatars§!, they harbor ambitions of expansion and may cause problems in the future if left unchecked. To the east lies the warlords of §GBerezniki§! and §GGayny§!. Although §GBerezniki§! pledges their resources to us, their governor may have ambitions of his own. On the other hand, relations with §GGayny§! have mostly been cordial, and it may be possible to sway them to the cause.\n\nThe §WPrincipality of Vyatka§! now stands poised to undertake the arduous task of uniting Russia once and for all. Will Russia find itself ruled by a Tsar once more? Only time will tell...\n\n§G==특징==§!\n\n* Decide between constitutionalism or the old government.\n\n* Prepare the §WPrincipality's§! armies for conflict with rival warlords.\n\n* Unify the §WRussian Empire§! once more."

 COUNTRY_INFO_SAMARA: "§G==러시아 국민의 자유를 위한 위원회==§!\n\nIn the bloodiest days of the West Russian War, when it seemed like the Reich's hold on Russia was on the verge of slipping forever, the German high command turned to desperate means to stave off the collapse of their front line. Drawn from a range of auxiliary colonial militias of Russian conscripts that were meant to police German-held Russia, the §WRussian Liberation Army§! or §WROA§! was created. In propaganda, the §WROA§! was depicted as a proud Russian army, fighting the §Rbolshevik§! menace of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§!. In desperation, the Germans even allowed the creation of the §WCommittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia§!, or §WKONR§!, as the embryo of a free Russian Republic that would rule over areas liberated by the German counter offensives.\n\nReality was much less flattering to the §WROA§!. Its leader §WAndrey Vlasov§!, a former Red Army general, was nothing more than a puppet of the Wehrmacht's high command. His officers were a a disjointed bunch. Many were also captured Red Army officers, preferring to join the §WROA§! than die in a German POW camp. Others were fascist émigrés, joining the §WROA§! on a great crusade to defeat §RBolshevism§!. The common soldiers were desperate cannon fodder, drafted at gunpoint by the Germans and sent to reinforce the most desperate sectors of the front. Far from being welcomed as liberators, Russian people caught in the conflict area welcomed §WROA§! soldiers with rock and insults.\n\nDespite all this, the §WROA§! pushed on. The soldiers fought with the energy of desperation, and managed to help turn the tide in the sector around §WSamara§!. Soon the §WROA§! found itself beyond the German lines, freed from their former taskmasters. With the war winding down and the §RWRRF§! in retreat, the Germans wrote off their cannon fodder as mutinous Slav Untermensch. The new headquarters of the §WROA§! in Samara were not spared any of the terror bombing campaigns that followed.\n\nSince then the §WROA§! has huddled in Samara, having traded one prison for another. Unable to expand their area of control by the terror bombings, and forbidden to go back home in the west, the common soldiers of the army have languished for the better part of a decade in their garrisons. The §WROA's§! officers, meanwhile, have grown weary of §WVlasov's§! indecisiveness. They argue for a more decentralized leadership, and for the abandonment of §WKONR's§! original democratic mission in favor of a continuation of the §WROA's§! junta. Using general §WSergei Bunyachenko§! as their mouthpiece, the men of the Officer's Committee scheme to take advantage of §WVlasov's§! apathy and old age. However the officers are not all united in ideology. Quite a few have formed a pro-democracy faction, and argue that §WVlasov's§! heir as chairman of §WKONR§! should be §WMiletiy Zykov§!, a former journalist that has maneuvered his way into being the chief propagandist of the §WROA's§! regime in Samara. Zykov argues for the continued struggle to liberate Russia from §RBolshevism§! as well as German oppression. In between all this, many common soldiers and lower ranking officers have grown tired of the high command's bickering and seek to follow General §WOktan's§! goal to use the §WROA§! to build a strong, fascist state... and to enrich the soldiers in the process.\n\nThe §WROA§! is at a crossroad. Loathed by all their neighbors as German collaborators, yet feared for their veteran army and iron discipline, the men of the §WROA§! await the end of the terror bombing. Some seek to redeem their honor by rebuilding Russia. Others seek vengeance on the communists and on the Germans who have ruined their life. Finally, a growing minority simply want to lash out at the uncaring world that has forced them to lose a decade holed in Samara.\n\n§G==특징==§!\n\n*Determine who shall win the power struggle to be the successor of §WVlasov§! as leader of the §WROA§!.\n\n*Finish what the Germans could not do and destroy the §RWRRF§! once and for all.\n\n*Show the world the perils of underestimating the so-called "traitorous dogs of the ROA.""

Regardless of whether they personally tolerate such underhanded tactics, the environment of the §GRepublic§! demands such tendencies, and so, the politicians which survive this unimaginably stressful environment tend to be forged into metaphorical diamonds - master schemers and maneuverers who can manipulate entire parties beneath their thumb.\n\n§BThe Centre:§!\nDespite the wide variety of democratic parties and the issues which cleave movements apart in Komi, the saving grace of the §GRepublic§! is that democracy, too, is a political question and hot-button topic. The intensity of the efforts to tear down democracy has forged the otherwise disparate centrist parties into a ramshackle coalition to preserve the electoral system at all costs, and fight radicalism. The ruling §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party (DSNP)§!, §MUnion of Young Reformers (SMR)§!, and §gSovereign Democratic Party (PSD)§! have all become tempered allies in the environment of the §GRepublic§!.\n\n§P니콜라이 알렉세예비치 보즈네센스키:§!\nThe §GPresident of the Republic§! and leader of the §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party§! since its founding, §PNikolai Voznesensky§! is a rather controversial man. Despite his initial electoral popularity, his constant scandals, often revolving around his abrasiveness, racist comments, or allegations of corruption, have eroded his popularity and cast many members of his party into an unfavorable public light. His friendship with the communist leader §SAndrei Zhdanov§! has come under scrutiny in recent months, and it only remains to be seen whether the 1963 election shall be the end of §PVozesensky§!'s political career, or merely the start of his next term."
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_2_NIK:0 "§M알렉세이 니콜라예비치 코시긴:§!\nA prominent elected Deputy, and leader of the §MUnion of Young Reformers§!, §MAlexei Kosygin§! is famed as a rather quiet and respectful politician, who serves as the chief "peacemaker" within the center. However, his disillusionment with the current composition of the §GCoalition§! is growing with each and every new scandal §PVoznesensky§! finds himself in, and he constantly finds himself looking at his own potential bid for power. Along with his close friend, §gSvetlana Stalina§!, §MKosygin§! forms the "hardline" wing of the centrist coalition - the wing that will never allow for capitulation to the radicals.\n\n§gSvetlana Iosifovna Stalina:§!\nA former §PDSNP§! member who split to form the §gSovereign Democratic Party§! following yet another infamous scandal, §gSvetlana Stalina§! is a rather young and idealistic firebrand who has overcome her reputation as a splitter, and cut out a position as a force in her own right. §gStalina§! forms the trustworthy right flank of the coalition, with a platform that combines a patriotic, security-centered policy with a strong focus on welfare and public works. Her constant praise of institutional power and stability, as well as her desire to stabilize the foundation of the §GRepublic§! by any means necessary, has led to constant accusations of authoritarianism, but her coalition partners tend to dismiss these claims. After all, §gStalina§! is utterly uncompromising - in her eyes, a strong, democratic §GRussian Free Republic§! is worth the cost - no matter how painful the means are to get there.\n\n§xThe Left:§!\nThe §xCommunist Party of Komi§! is notable in that it is the most united political "wing" in the Republic. The infamous §xMikhail Suslov§! has forged an ironclad political machine out of the far left, leading successful operation after operation to stage scandals, shatter the people's confidence in the government, and establish an environment of constant pressure on the §GRepublic§!'s security forces. However, despite its unity, not all is well within the §xCommunist Party§!. The cracks between its leaders are invisible in public, but all too apparent behind closed doors. In the eyes of Party insiders, a conflict between §xMikhail Suslov§! and §rIvan Serov§!'s orthodox faction and §SAndrei Zhdanov§! and §lSvetlana Bukharina§!'s reformist faction is inevitable - all that remains to be seen is how destructive it shall be to the §xParty§!'s very foundations.\n\n§x미하일 안드레예비치 수슬로프:§!\nThe stories that one would hear of Komi's infamous "shadow master", §xMikhail Suslov§!, are awe-inspiring, and wide in scope. According to various citizens of the §GRepublic§!, §xSuslov§! is personally behind nearly every aspect of the chaos in Komi, personally orchestrating street battles, robberies, and blackmailing rings while he plays the violin in his townhouse. Not every story is true, of course, but §xSuslov§!'s reputation speaks for itself.\n\nA famed leader within the WRRF with such a fearful political reputation that §RMikhail Tukhachevsky§! condemned him for couping the government without any evidence, §xSuslov§! has maintained his talents throughout the Russian wasteland, honing them more and more as his career advances. §xSuslov§! is a brilliant man who views the §GRepublic§! as his chessboard - a complex machine made up of interlocking mechanisms of class conflict and civil strife. With every move of his paramilitaries and "unaffiliated" Deputies in the §GNational Assembly§!, he comes closer and closer to his goal - the end of the §GRepublic§!, and the restoration of the §RUSSR§!, with himself as the grey cardinal behind it all.\n\n§S안드레이 알렉산드로비치 즈다노프:§!\n§SAndrei Zhdanov§! is a walking contradiction. He is the leader of the §xCommunist Party§!'s §GNational Assembly§! delegation, and one of the highest figures in the Party - yet his libertarianism and populism seems to fly in the face of what §xSuslov§! is widely considered to want. §SZhdanov§! is a visionary in every way, a fierce, charismatic firebrand - yet he tends to align with §PVoznesensky§!'s government constantly, seemingly missing opportunities to perpetuate the §RRevolution§! that the §xCommunist Party§! so desires. The mystery behind §SZhdanov§!'s motivations and operations raise many questions, but none can doubt his character. According to many centrists across the aisle, if one Communist were to take power, it would have to be §SZhdanov§!. After all... where else could one find such charming, moderate, populist spirit?\n\n§l스베틀라나 니콜라예브나 부하리나:§!\nThe emergence of the daughter of the doomed §RNikolai Bukharin§! within the §GRepublic§! was hardly expected, but it was hailed by many communists as a sign that their movement was destined for greatness comparable to the strength of the old §RVKP(b)§!. §lSvetlana Bukharina§! rapidly rose into the ranks of the §xCommunist Party§!, being elected by unheard-of margins, bringing her unstoppable energy and ambition with her. Despite her comparative youth compared to many figures within the government, and her questionable adherence to the letter of the line that §xSuslov§! promotes within the §xParty§!, §lBukharina§! is most certainly one of the foremost communists within the §GRepublic§! - and the brightest, most radiant rising star among their number."

After this defeat Vasilevsky took up the task ensuring the Red Army would survive, no matter what. Gathering all the men that would follow him, Vasilevsky set out to regroup on the Mongolian steppe where the Luftwaffe could not reach them. There Vasilevsky hoped to regroup on the steppe, pushing out from the East to the West. His aim was to avoid the food scarcity and bombing that those who went north with Voroshilov suffer now. Unfortunately, the Imperial Japanese Army was advancing upon these lands already.\n\nWith their collaborators, the Japanese Imperialists would claim all of Mongolia. Would the Red Army abandon the Mongolian people to exploitation and deprivation? Could Vasilevsky rejoin with his brethren in the WRRF if he did so? An uneasy alliance was made with the remnants of the Mongolian Army, the Mongolian and Tuvan people. All would be treated equal by the Red Army, but the Red Army would have primacy over all else. This was the era of warlords and there could be no other compromise in this regard.\n\nAt first the bond of mutual destruction by Imperialists, a mad king, a rogue army, and the madman exploiting Bukharin's legitimacy for his paranoid insanity kept the Revolutionary Council united in purpose. Tensions mount as opportunities now arise to end this period of stagnation. Therefore, the Revolutionary Council has its attention drawn in two directions. The Russians, made up entirely of Red Army veterans, wish to return to their homeland and restore the Soviet order upon the warlords. The Mongolians, who hold solidarity with the Tuvans, desire to push against the puppets of the Sphere. They sense weakness now that Mengjiang is torn apart in open rebellion and see this as the perfect opportunity to unite the nation. If Vasilevsky is to keep the Council whole he must navigate the desires of both groups.\n\nIt will be no easy task. The Russians and Mongolians are both proud peoples. And they have every right to be, for we are unconquered. We are unconquerable!

As the advance slowed, cracks began to show between the Tsarists and the fascists, and soon the Whites under §RAtaman Semyonov§! seized the city of Chita and officially distanced themselves from the party. If the Vozhd was surprised at this turn of events, he was enraged when former party member §RMikhail Matkovsky§! split the party and set up a rival government in the remote port of §WMagadan§!, posing a threat to the Vozhd's legitimacy and rule.\n\nSince then, based in the small town of Zeya, the Vozhd has become dejected and increasingly paranoid.

That is the party line, the truth the §rNSDAP§! set in the world and that Hitler finally confirmed in the course of the §RSecond World War§!. When victory came, it did so in glory the Reich had not seen in close to a century - her eternal enemies beaten, crushed under the greatest war-machine the world had ever seen. Hitler became the lynchpin of this glory and to this day his name is written with any mention of it, alongside §Rthose innumerable crimes committed in the process§!. What followed was a decade of prosperity and power, where the Reich stood as the unquestioned hegemon of the world - and utter despair and tragedy in the years after, where the people saw it all crumble to dust. The Führer could only watch... watch, and smile. Watch, and cry.\n\n§L마르틴 보어만§!\nThere are few men in the §WReich§! as powerful as §LMartin Bormann§!, Chief of the Party Chancellery. Supported by many and hated by just as many, §LBormann§! has deftly cleaved his way through the byzantine politics that dominate the §WReich§!. Today, he not only stands as, effectively, the spokesman of the §rNSDAP§!, but as the face of the §WReich's§! conservative movement, heartily preaching the values of §rNational Socialism§! and only suggesting minor changes to curb corruption and inefficiency, in contrast to §OSpeer's§! reformism and §gGöring's§! militarism. With his close ties to §rHitler§!, his relative dominance over the §rReichstag§!, and his track record as a loyal supporter of §rNational Socialism§!, §LBormann§! is widely regarded in international circles as the most likely successor to the §rFührership§!.

One of the original members of the §rNSDAP§!, §gGöring§! commands respect in the way that few others can. With the conservative wing of the Party already firmly under §LBormann's§! control, §gGöring§! turned to the §rHeer§!, quickly aligning just over half of the armed forces to his view. Backed by Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, §gGöring§! promises to bring the §WReich§! back to its glory days- not through reforms, but through conquest. Under §gGöring's§! command, the §WReich§! would march on the rest of the world, conquering anyone and everyone who got in its way. This hyperaggressive foreign policy has certainly raised concerns among the international community- a worry that is not helped by §gGöring's§! seemingly good chance to be nominated as the next §rFührer§!. Whether he could pull off all he promises, however, remains to be seen.\n\n§O알베르트 슈페어§!\nDepending on who you ask, §OAlbert Speer§! is either the man who can save the §WReich§! or the man who will destroy it. Few men can boast such fame or such controversy as the §WReich§!'s chief architect, whose current goal is to destroy the system that he himself set up- the system of slavery which, as he claims, is choking the life out of the §WReich§!. Having surrounded himself with the §GGang of Four§!- Ludwig Erhard, Helmut Schmidt, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Henning von Tresckow- §OSpeer§! has taken a decidedly reformist tack, seizing the youth with his promises of general liberalization and a better future. Of course, whether §OSpeer§! is as reformist as both his greatest supporters and his staunchest enemies claim is a much different story, as he himself seems unwilling to go as far as the Gang pushes him to. Though his friendship with §rAdolf Hitler§! gives him a chance to be nominated as the §rFührer's§! successor, it's unclear whether he could back that up with force if push came to shove. . .\n\n§P라인하르트 하이드리히§!\n§RThe Butcher of Prague, the Blonde Beast, The Young Evil God of Death§!- many names have been conjured for §PReinhard Heydrich§!, and yet none of them can accurately sum up the man that is almost universally reviled throughout the §WReich§!.

As head of an organization that is the black sheep of Germany, most see §PHeydrich§! as nothing more that §PHeinrich Himmler's§! puppet on a string, only serving as a figurehead for his nefarious agenda. Technically, §PHeydrich§! is a possible candidate for the §rFührership§!- however, with almost no political power nor popular support, such a choice seems unlikely. In the event that §PHeydrich§! not only is selected as the next §rFührer§!, but secures control over the §WReich§! and defeats his competitors, the world can only quake at the thought of a proud supporter of the §RBurgundian System§! controlling one of the most powerful nations on Earth."

His protege, §YRobert McIntrye§! has served as his Prime Minister, as well as serving as the member of the SNP. However not all is well in one of the last bastions of democracy on the British Isles. §YMacCormick§! is growing sicker and sicker everyday, with his health declining. His death after leading the country for nineteen years could leave drastic results. As parliament discusses bills and other proposals, many of the Scottish people worry that their country could be in a paralyzed state after his death. However, some opponents have used §YMacCormick's§! nickname against him comparing him to the dictators of Europe due to his uninterrupted rule.\n\nWhile it may seem like a one party state due to the dominance of the §YSNP§! for the past nineteen years, there had been two other primary parties who had been biding their time, campaigning to gather representatives in the Scottish Parliament. At the forefront of the two is the §PIndependent Labour Party§!. In the chaos and uncertainty of the Fall of §REngland§!, the §PLabour Party§! had faced fractures and the slow demise. Many of its members had been arrested and detained by the §gGestapo§! as many fled to §BScotland§!. The §BScottish§! branch of the §PLabour Party§! needed reform to stay afloat in this new country. In this, the §PIndependent Labour Party§! was formed, however it had been on a decline due to the stunning popularity of the §YSNP§!. It looked as if it would dissolve until §PWilliam Wolfe§!, a former member of the §YSNP§! had joined and reformed them into the force they are today.\n\nThe smaller of the three, the §OUnionist Party§! led by §OPriscilla Buchan§! is seen more of a rump party than an actual competitor compared to the juggernaut that is the §YSNP§! and the growing popularity of the §PILP§!. However §OBuchan§! and her party are hopeful for the future. §OBuchan§! herself was a former member of the Conservative Party before arriving in §BScotland§!. After much consideration and funding arriving from a mysterious benefactor, the §OUnionist Party§! was formed. While seen as a laughingstock by both the §YSNP§! and §PILP§!, the §OUP§! is a party full of committed members who have been known for being quite large in attendance at the polling stations with the membership slowly growing. Other elements are at play however, and these may leave a lasting effect on §BScotland§! forever.\n\nOne of the largest figureheads in §BScotland§! is the de facto leader of the §QScottish Armed Forces§!, Marshal §QDouglas Wimberley§!. Loved by his soldiers and the local students of the many colleges and universities of §BScotland§!, he has been known for bringing back dedication and pride into the many subjects he likes. Being one of the other founders of the current republic, he has quite the public image. To his more closest friends and advisors, they know that Wimberley can be a paranoid man. While all may seem well to the citizens of §BScotland§!, the Armed Forces are in a constant state of alert. With the §RCollaborators§! on the border, the threat of attack is constant. This ideal has been drilled into the §QArmed Forces§! and is something that the generals and admirals live by. §QWimberley§! is a smart man and will put it on the line to protect Scottish independence and freedom as he sees it.\n\n==특징==\n\nDecide the Future of §BScotland§! as the Last Free Democracy in Europe.\n\nBalance the §QScottish Armed Forces§! with the Paranoia Mechanic.\n\nReunite the British Isles and save §REngland§! from the §RCollaborators.§!"

Perhaps then it is inevitable that they would be subjected to the same depredations they inflicted on a thousand nations at the hands of §gGermany§!. §xEngland§! in this new and untested era is not the same place as it once was, for instead of the traditional power structures it is lead by a loose alliance of all those who want no more war with the Reich. The §gRoyal Party§!. Under §gAlec Douglas-Home§! the party has recovered greatly from the miserable days of the war and the chaos following the 1953 London Uprising by communist revolutionaries. §gHome§! leads the §gModerate§! faction of the RP, the largest portion of the coalition dedicated more to stability than any true ideals beyond that. At his side is §zHarold Macmillan§! and the §zReformists§!, who nominally adhere to democratic principles but are willing to compromise with §gHome§! for the good of §xEngland§!. Also present are the §OHardliners§!, dedicated fascists led by §OArthur Kenneth Chesterton§! who advocate for a state closer to the German model. Despite their differences, all three of these groups have been willing to work together for the sake of §xEngland§!'s recovery. But recovery doesn't meant stability, for another faction exists within §xEngland§!, §eHMMLR§!.\n\nHer Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance is a network of several different rebel groups all answering to one unknown man, allegedly called "the Boss". The organisation itself can be traced back to the aftermath of the 2nd World War, but it wasn't until the defeat and nigh annihilation of the Communist Party of Great Britain at the Third Battle of Cable Street that §eHMMLR§! rose to the fore of the English rebel organisations. §eHMMLR§! proper are dedicated to the return of the person they believe is the rightful monarch of §xEngland§!, Queen Elizabeth II. A somewhat conservative organisation, it is surprising that they allied with the second largest faction, The §RLeft Resistance§!. Led by §RBill Alexander§!, a veteren of the West Russian War, Spanish Civil War and a dozen wars in between, along with being one of the few notable survivors of Third Cable Street, The §RLeft Resistance§! are an eclectic mix of communists, socialists and even most of the old Labour Party united under a common banner and cause. The third piece of the puzzle can be found in §GDavid Stirling§! and his §GCommando's§!. The only rebel group to be in active rebellion from the end of the 2nd World War when he deserted, §GStirling's§! §GCommando's§! are the smallest of the three major parts of §eHMMLR§! but also the best trained and equipped. What sets them apart from their brethren however is their fierce republicanism and an unquenchable desire for vengeance upon the traitors to §xEngland§!.\n\nThese two factions will eventually have to face off, though in what circumstances and when remains to be seen. But the victor will have an opportunity to decide not just the fate of England, but potentially the fate of Britain as well.\n\nFeatures\n\nDecide the fate of England through elections and politicking\n\nReunite the Isles, for better or worse.\n\nPlay your part in the great game between the Reich and the OFN.\n\nEngland Prevails!"

 COUNTRY_INFO_IRE: "§G==아일랜드 공화국==§!\n\nThe twentieth century opened in a dark time for the people of §GIreland§!, subjugated as they were by their overlords in §RLondon§!. But circumstance and stubbornness allowed the §GIrish§! to have a state of their own once more, and for a time it seemed as though peace would be the way of things between the §REnglish§! and their §Gformer subject§!. Then, the §qGerman Reich§! attacked. Through Warsaw, Paris and even London itself did the German boot march, and §YEamon de Valera§!, Prime Minister, leader of §LFianna Fáil§! and the Irish Hero, was faced with the choice of siding with a §Rdoomed power§! or making §Gthe republic's§! place in the §gnew world order§! assured through blood.\n\nThe §Yde Valera§! administration authorised the §GIrish§! invasion with §gGerman§! assistance, of the region known as §ONorthern Ireland§!, the only part of the §Gemerald Isle§! kept under §SBritish rule§!. On the back of a successful and short albeit bloody campaign, §LFianna Fáil§! hasn't merely come to dominate §GIrish§! politics over the past decades but in effect become the sole ruling party. §cFine Gael§! has withered on the vine, whilst the socialist §eSinn Féin§! was banned outright. Yet not everyone is content with the state of affairs, especially §GIrish§! membership in the German dominated §qUnity Pakt§!.\n\n§LFF§! dominance waned during the tumultuous times of the 50's, and whilst §Yde Valera§! is well liked by the average Irishman there are many who began to tire of his rule as once small mistakes began to pile up slowly but surely. Thus when §LSeán Lemass§! suggested that §Yde Valera§! take the more ceremonial position of the presidency where he could retain influence still, it was a trivial issue for the old man to accept, though he cautioned §LLemass§! not to coalition with §SLabour§! before he did so. It must have come as an unpleasant surprise to the elderly revolutionary when the new Prime Minister did exactly that and formed the current government as a §LFF§!-§SLabour§! coalition, with de Valera powerless to stop it. And in the midst of this disagreement §LFF§! has started to show even more vulnerability than before.\n\nNow after a disappointingly narrow victory in the 61 elections, three factions of §LFF§! stand to contest the parties future. The §LDe Valerists§!, supporters of the conservative old guard and §YLemass§!'s support base. The §qHardliners§! of §YNeil Blaney§!, catholic supremacists who are disliked fervently by the north, and §YJack Lynch§!'s awkwardly named §TLiberals§!. Who despite having little in common with the ideology are nonetheless the most reform minded of §LFF§!.\n\nWhat makes these divisions important is that each has a differing approach to the §ONorthern Irish Autonomous Counties§!, the largely protestant former British territories have not taken well to §YNeil Blaney§!'s governance, and terrorism is rife from §OUlster§! to §ODerry§!. Many do not recognise §Yde Valera§!'s signing of the §GRepublic of Ireland§! act which remove §GIreland§! from the Commonwealth, and this leaves the possibility open to §TOFN§! or §REnglish§! interference should they find an excuse.\n\nNow in 1962 §GIreland§! has a future uncertain set before it, one can say it has two visions for it: Fianna Fáil's vision of status quo and stability or the vision of change of Fine Gael.

Nonetheless, on the surface, Japanese hold of the Pacific is firm and secure, only threatened by the vexed postulations the Americans in the east and Germans to the west.\n\n§OThe Co-Prosperity Sphere§!, a geopolitical organization set up to hold together Japanese prizes from conquests, stands tall over Asia to unite the liberated nations under the leadership of the Imperial State. IJA garrisons stand to defend Japan's allies, marching from the banks of the Amur river to the jungles of Bengal, and IJN fleets patrol the eastern waters to guard from foreign incursion.\n\nIt is 1962, and Tokyo rules over The East. The New Order has resettled differences between nations and peoples, with entire civilizations now faced to bear witness to the might of the Rising Sun. However, old habits die hard, and generations will not forget their bitter rivalries with neighboring enemies and resent for their colonial oppressors."

 REGIONAL_INFO_WEST_SIBERIA: "§G==서시베리아==§!\n\nWith the death of the §GSoviet Union§! came the birth of the §WWest Siberian People's Republic§!, a Bolshevik state headed by the authoritarian §GLazar Kaganovich§!. Assigned to the isolated region under Bukharin, Lazar wove webs and forged alliances that put him at the helm of an iron nation. But with time came vengeance, so when §GWest Russia§! launched its infamous war against the §Rfascist aggressor§!, the Republic stood by. But with war came defeat, bitter loss that took its final toll upon the Russian people. City after city, civilization collapsed into anarchy, out of which arose idealist states and the stuff of nightmares.\n\nThe West Siberian People's Republic was thrown into chaos as well, suffering from a lack of initiative and back-stabbings against Kaganovich's regime. The collapse came with no surprise, fracturing into petty warlords:\n\nIn the center sits the steel city of §GTyumen§!, below which gather armies in preparation for the next war. Smoke bellows from massive factories to the sound of marching feet, soldiers heading in one direction, resettled peasants in the other. §GKaganovich§! and §GKhrushchev§! cling against hope that they may repudiate their past mistakes. But to the North lies a greater adversary - §WSverdlovsk§!, commanded by the aging §GGeneral Konstantin Rokossovsky§!. A father to his men, the military junta wields a powerful army but remains relatively apolitical. In its crosshairs is Tyumen, and next, all of Russia. In the South, hugging the wastes of Kazakhstan, sleeps a monster of great malice. The spartan city of §ROmsk§! extends its bony grip across Western Siberia, rallying men whose mere names conjure fear. Like a chessmaster, the §RBlack League§! calculates its every move, but whispers speak of death and a succession crisis.\n\nHigh atop the mountains sits the §Ymerchant republic of Zlatoust§!. Content with one of the largest military complexes in Russia, the merchants of death help arm the armies which may one day lead to their own demise. But the Republic is also home to innovators, its stability and justice attracts many refugees. New rifles pour from modern assembly lines - anyone who wishes to obtain the treasures of the Mountain will have to come and take it. But Zlatoust is not alone - in the North is the §WThief Territory of Yugra§!. A country without laws, ran by bandits and thugs, Yugra launches constant raids for food and ammunition.\n\nCornered against the icy sea is §WVorkuta§!, remnants of the Vortukan Corrective Labor camp. One of the largest §RGULAGs§! in Russia, its prisoners freeze before the guards, themselves confined to ancient structures, feeding on scraps. The last 'warlord' are the §WFree Aviators§!, remnants of the Soviet air corps. Unique in its leadership, the Aviators do not have a functioning government - rather, they are a collection of airfields, the last line of defense against the Lufwaffe's endless onslaught. The Aviators command respect from all factions, but their numbers dwindle every day, until there will be none left. Rumours of Hitler's imminent death and the Pakt's collapse may halt the terror bombings, paving the way for a war of national reclamation.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Mobilize the industry and rally your armies to rebuild Western Siberia, either under the Crimson flag or the Black League.\n\n*Utilize superior industry to conquer Western Russia when the time is right, but do not forget about the Southern Urals.\n\n*Gear for the inevitable war against Germany."

 REGIONAL_INFO_CENTRAL_SIBERIA: "§G==중앙시베리아==§!\n\nCentral Siberia once stood defiantly as the §WCentral Siberian Republic§!, the world's eyes on its capital §WTomsk§! as the young nation strove confidently into the future. Holding most of Russia's remaining industry as a result of Bukharin's Central Siberian Industrial Plan, the Republic was seen as the likeliest candidate for Russian Unification.\n\nIn the end however, it was not German Fascism but the inability of Russians to work together that brought down the nation. Internal strife and a foreign invasion broke the back of the Central Siberian Republic, leaving a myriad of successor states in its wake.\n\nTo the South West, the §WFederation of Novosibirsk and Barnaul§! plots to make good use of its agricultural land and heavy industry to reunite the region. Legendary ace pilot §WPokryshkin§! and his junta had a first row seat to the collapse of the old Republic. They plan not to repeat its mistakes. East of the federation one can find §Wthe Principalty of Kemerovo§!. Led by §WKing Rurik II§!, the small statelets blend of medieval Russia and modernity leaves many confused. Some write off §WRurik II§! as a mad old fool. Others note that his well ran state and well trained army is likely to play an important part in future events.\n\nEast of §WKemerovo§!, another breakaway state led by a former §WCSR§! general can be found in §WKrasnoyarsk§!. The shaky democracy's future is uncertain; what is clearer is that §WNikolai Andreev§! and his fellow mutineers will fight tooth and nail to maintain their independence. Meanwhile, to the §WPrincipalty's§! south one can find the mountainous §WKarakorum Government of Oyrotia§!. Cut off from the §WCSR's§! central government, the small nation of Altai people and Old Believer refugees have united in their effort to avoid bloodshed and oppression for their religious beliefs.\n\nEast of §WKrasnoyarsk§! lies an expanse of villages and free cities. Imagining the area undefended would however be a dangerous mistake, for the §WSiberian Black Army§! zealously defends the region. Adherents of a particularly militarized variant of anarchism, the leadership of the §WBlack Army§! plots its next moves. All of Russia must be freed from statist oppression, beginning with Central Siberia.\n\nFinally to the north, the rump of the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! controls the city of Tomsk and the vast arctic expanses beyond. Many have written off the city of artists and thinkers as soft, decadent and unable to contend with the loss of a majority of its army to secessions and rebellions. Nevertheless, §WPresident Pasternak§! has not given up. Nearing the end of his life, the Poet President plans to entrust the rump §WCSR§! to a new political elite, one able to restore the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! to greatness.\n\nExhausted by war with the §RRussian Far East§! and civil conflicts for a few years, the rivalries of Central Siberia have begun to rouse the various warlords from their fragile peace. There is only enough room in Central Siberia for one nation, one heir to Bukharin's Industrial Cornucopia. The Soviet era's foundries and factories will cause yet more bloodshed as the unification wars begin!\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*§WUnite§! the rich Central Siberian region and use it as a springboard to Russian Reunification.\n\n*§WManage§! your share of the Central Siberian industries, expanding it and dealing with worker right issues as the regional conflict heats up."

 REGIONAL_INFO_FAR_EAST: "§G==극동==§!\n\nThe §WRussian Far East§! is far and away the least populated region in Russia, and contains some of the most treacherous and hostile landscapes in the continent. The cataclysmic collapse of the §GSoviet Union§! did little to change this state of affairs, and even a far flung region such as this is now home to all manner of warlords seeking to stake their claim to Russia.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, §GGenrikh Yagoda§! fled east with the remnants of the Soviet Presidium and reestablished order over the province of §GIrkutsk§!. From there, he has solidified an iron reign over the region that has frequently come into conflict with neighboring rival warlords such as the §RCentral Siberian Republic§!. It was not to last, however, as disaster soon struck.\n\nFrom the Manchurian city of §GHarbin§!, dark forces crossed the Amur and marched north to wage a bloody war of vengeance against §RBolshevism§!. §GKonstantin Rodzaevsky§! and his §GRussian Fascist Party§! were the tip of this invasion's spear, shattering Yagoda's influence in the East and establishing his own regime in the city of Zeya. It wasn't long, however, before Rodzaevsky himself was threatened with collapse.\n\nA "moderate" faction of the RFP led by §GMikhail Matkovsky§! grew disgusted with Rodzaevsky's admiration of the §RNazi invaders§!, and over time came to resent his dogmatic rhetoric. These tensions came to a head, and resulted in Matkovsky's loyalists snatching the key port of §GMagadan§! from Rodzaevsky's grasp. Sensing their chance, §GWhite Army§! remnants based in Harbin secured control over their old stronghold in §GChita§!. With a claimant of their own, one §GMikhail II§!, they plan to restore the monarchy to Russia by whatever means necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, The final threat to §GYagoda's§! power came in the form of a mutiny. Former NKVD officer §GValery Sablin§!, a young and idealistic revolutionary, seized control over the province of §GBuryatia§! and declared an open revolt against Yagoda and the Presidium. As of 1962, this war is still raging, and it is unclear who will come out on top.\n\nTo the north, the region has devolved into total anarchy. Very few have made their homes in this arctic hell, and there is not likely to be much in the way of action here. However, there are scattered rumors amongst the tribes and villages of the north of a §Gpowerful figure§! with the strength to reunify the nation...\n\nThe §WRussian Far East§! is a desolate and bloodsoaked land, and it is not likely to get any better until this wasteland is united once and for all.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Defend the last remnant of the Soviet Union, or bring about its destruction.\n\n*Make the most with what you have in a desolate landscape.\n\n*Be wary of §Gthe North§!."

 REGIONAL_INFO_URAL: "§G==남부 우랄==§!\n\n§WThe Southern Urals§! represent the Russian Anarchy at its best and worst. To the west, §WThe Communes of Orenburg§! constitute thousands of citizens in its anarchic council, while the shrewd management of §WOrenburg§! itself has led to it gleaming brightly as the Gem of the Urals. While dysfunctional, §WOrenburg§! nevertheless represents the achievements of the Russian people even in this dark stage of their history. To the north sits the §WUral League§!, the paramilitary children of Vorkuta, who, after the union of both guards and prisoners in the 50s, have dedicated themselves to protecting the week and needy of Russia.\n\nTo their south, however, lies the §WDirlewanger Brigade§!. They are dastardly bandits, the result of in-fighting in the §RGerman§! ranks during the §WWest Russian War§!, Dirlewanger and his crew of only the most depraved criminals from the SS and Eastern Europe having carved themselves out a petty fiefdom in what was once §WOrsk§!. Their goal? §WOrenburg§!, and the great loot contained within. But he is not alone in this desire, for §WTrofim Lysenko§!, petty warlord of §WMagnitogorsk§!, also looks hungrily westward. The maddened remainder of the Soviet science program with his own pet army in the §W22nd Motor Rifle NKVD§!, §WLysenko§! plots his eventual invasion of §WOrenburg§! for the perfect opportunity to collect thousands of test subjects to create a secret weapon... a super soldier army capable of defeating the §RGermans§!.\n\nWhile §WOrenburg§! and §WThe Ural League§! will make natural allies in their defense against the bandits, §WLysenko§! is a pragmatist, and so is §WDirlewanger§!. It is likely that pacts will form, but the question is ultimately what to do once they outlast their use... and what to do if forces outside of the Urals some day come knocking to their door.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* A §Wshort§!, five year game, aimed at defeating the opposing two (or three) factions in the Urals.\n\n* §WUnify§! the communes of Orenburg or handle Lysenko's waning §Wsanity§!, §Wravage§!

But the glorious years have passed §WGermania§!. Now its grip loosens with every day bickering paralyzes the Volkshalle.\n\nNot all has fallen to the fascist menace, however. At the continent's tip burns defiant the §WUnion of South Africa§!, among the old Empire's last dominions across the seas - certainly the last of what had once stretched from Cape Town to Cairo. Its fortunes have waned since the war's end; with Namibia torn from its grasp and its own people split in three loyalties, Africa's last democracy flickers and wanes amidst incessant threats of secession, rebellion, and invasion. Nevertheless, the Union's men hold firm along the Orange River's banks, steeling themselves with the certitude of a death in defense of their homes.\n\nFor to their north stands a triumvirate of Africa's most powerful men: §YReichskommissars Wolfgang Schenck§!, §YSiegfried Müller§! and §YHans Hüttig§!, viceroys of a third each of the Reich's Mittelafrikan conquests. Though cartographers depict their lands as one contiguous stretch of pitch black the same shade as the Heimat's, each §WReichskommissariat§! cannot be any more different from the rest. Companies and mercenaries the world over loot §WZentralafrika's§! vast wealth unheeded as §YMüller§! eagerly plans his next hunting expedition. §YSchenck§! and his Luftwaffe dance among the clouds far above §WSüdwestafrika§!, heedless of the troubles plaguing his subjects below.\n\nOnly §YHüttig§!, master of the Dark Continent's true Aryan bastion and overseer of a million slaves, casts a frigid eye beyond §WOstafrika's§! borders. Few but his closest advisors can divine the plans lurking in the zealot's mind; with his tendencies, fewer bet they will bring the continent anything but misery and grief.\n\nIt is 1962, and the §WNew Order§! frays at its edges. Old enmities resurge as a thousand plans spring into action. Circumstance binds three desperate eagles into one hesitant, tenuous alliance.

 MOD_FEATURES_TEXT_2:0 "§R==상호확증파괴==§!\n§WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! ultimately takes place during a Cold War, and not a World War. Each of the major three nations: §Wthe United States§!, §WGermany§!, and §WJapan§!, enjoy full §Rnuclear triad capabilities§! as of 1962; locking the world under the fear of §Rnuclear holocaust§!.\n\nAs such, nations are ultimately at the whim of the §Gsuperpowers§! of the world, and they are forever locked against one another without the means to secure an easy victory. Any war between the three §Gsuperpowers§! will inevitably be §RWorld War III§!.\n\nWhen §RWorld War III§! is fought, it can not end well. The sides will fight until one side begins to falter. If a nation feels that it is about to collapse, is unable to continue a war, or has their core territory overwhelmingly threatened then §Rnuclear war§! is an inevitability. If a nuclear strike is launched, it will be a matter of days until thousands of nuclear weapons are deployed in the war. If this happens, it is §Rgame over§!! Luckily, diplomacy is the norm. §RNuclear war§! is rare, extremely so if not playing as a nuclear power, and most nations would rather work through issues instead of fight over them. The §WDEFCON§! tracker in the §RWorld Tension§! menu in the top right will tell you how high the §WDEFCON§! level is globally. The higher this is, the more likely that diplomatic options will fail. At max levels of §WDEFCON§!, war is inevitable.\n\n§Y==PROXY WARS==§!\nThis does not mean that war is uncommon in §WThe New Order§!. On the contrary, war is actually §Gextremely common§! and you will fight several as almost every nation. However, wars are not expressed through direct conflict, but instead normally as §RProxy Wars§!. §RProxy Wars§! are wars between two nations, who are backed by two larger nations using their conflict as a way to battle one another without an outright battle. These can also occur during §RCivil Wars§!, which are also exceedingly common.\n\nDuring a §RProxy War§!, nations at war with one another may find themselves being supported by an outside power. If nobody is playing as the backing power, then units will be gifted to the nation fighting the war. If a player is the backing power, however, they will be able to support their side via the §WVolunteer System§! as in vanilla §WHearts of Iron IV§!.\n\nBe careful however! Proxy wars are dangerous prospects, and can rapidly increase the §WDEFCON§! level! §R'Diplomatic Crisis'§! may be common, and possibly influenced by external actors. One wrong move, and you can cause global destruction.\n\n§Y==DIPLOMATIC CRISIS==§!\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! are randomly fired throughout the duration of many wars and §RProxy Wars§!. A §RDiplomatic Crisis§! is an event chain showing an increase in tension that can escalate to full on global war. Traditionally, this means an event is fired for one §Wparticipant§! in a conflict, allowing them to take some form of loss by backing down from the crisis or gain by pushing against the other power. The defending power will then get the opportunity to do the same, and escalate further or back down. This continues for some time, with the reward increasing but alongside the loss, until one side buckles and backs down. If no side backs down, §Rthis will spark war between both sides!§!\n\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! become more common the higher the §WDEFCON§! level is, and can also be fired during peace time! Remember to put the safety of the world before pride, or to exploit the game of powers in order to encourage the conflict...\n\n§G==NARRATIVE==§!\n§WThe New Order§! and its demo are a §Gnarrative§! based mod. This means that the mod is more story based than any other for §WHearts of Iron IV§!\n\nWhat this really means is that the gameplay loop of §GHearts of Iron IV§! is very different from the one of §WThe New Order§!. Gone is the linear build up towards a war with the option to choose an ideology before then, with an occasional event fired to give you a small boost. Instead, you will be navigating a country much like a §W'Choose Your Own Adventure'§! novel. While there will be plenty of opportunity for war, gameplay decisions, and many many nations have their own mechanics to learn, ultimately the feeling is one of playing a story.\n\nSo please, sit back, relax and enjoy the story while you work through your country. Paths should generally be self explanatory and if you find yourself overly confused please let us know and we'll see what we can do to make it easier in the future.
