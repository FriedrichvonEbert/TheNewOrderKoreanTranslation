### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "Born in 1895, Liu Wenhui is a military man through and through, graduating from Baoding Military Academy in 1916. Returning to Sichuan from Baoding, Liu Wenhui originally joined Liu Cunroi's Sichuan clique, but later joined the Kuomintang in 1926. Quickly rising the ranks of the National Revolution Army, Liu was promoted to Commander of the NRA's 24th Army, and appointed governor of the entirety of Sichuan Province in 1929. Facing fierce competition from more than 5 other warlords, Sichuan Province was exceedingly unstable and a hotbed for conflict. Coalitions, counter coalitions, skirmishes and plotting defined his governorship of Sichuan as he struggled to maintain power. Eventually in 1934 he lost power to his nephew, Liu Xiang, and was kicked out of Sichuan and declared Governor of Xikang province instead. Liu's relationship with Chiang Kai-shek, much like the province of Sichuan itself, was unstable. Far away from the central government, Liu was able to repeatedly deny orders from Chiang.\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, Liu Wenhui was cautious and made sure his troops saw as little action as possible. When the Japanese arrived in Sichuan during their Go-Go offensive, Liu Wenhui, as the strongest remaining contender in Sichuan, rallied his men and retreated far into Xikang, setting up camp in the small city of Ya'an. Liu refused to surrender to Japanese, and the Japanese, seeing no importance in the small mountain province, decided not to follow him.\n\nNow more than a decade after Japan's offensive into Sichuan, Liu Wenhui sits isolated as one of the only remaining free warlords in China. His native homeland of Sichuan lies across the border, and while it may be under the direct control of the central government, Sichuan has once again been plunged into instability with many factions and partisans battling it out for control. While Liu himself would like to see a free China, he faces resistance from many of his subordinates who claim facing Japan would be suicide. It would truly take a miracle for Liu Wenhui to take up arms once more..."

#Events
xik.1.t:0 "Ya'an calls for aid!"
xik.1.d:0 "Shocking news today, as clashes sounded within the central Ya'an police station, resulting in the police within the building being expelled! Fearing a greater uprising the governor immediately called for martial law and urgently called for Wenhui to reinforce the city. These fears however seem to have been overblown, with the only extra disturbances being petty criminals with incredibly bad timing. Nonetheless the police station has now been occupied and barricaded by the group, and wenhui's orders have been requested on how to respond to this siege."
xik.1.a:0 "Who is it that has done this?"
xik.5.t:0 "Siege in Ya'an Police Station"
xik.5.d:0 "Arriving in the city Wenhui has asked for further clarification of the situation, only to find himself more confused than before. The station windows have been covered in Chinese republican flags, images of dragons, lotuses and other nationalist symbols, and even a large hand drawn portrait of Liu Wenhui draped over the front doors. Additionally it has been reported by the recently evicted officers that many of the usurpers were quite young, teenagers and some quite well dressed. Whatever their goals it is assumed by our chief of police that they will soon gain access to the weapons safe if they have not already, and urges us to crush the rebellion before it gains weapons and allies. The police blockade stands ready, whatever we choose."
xik.5.a:0 "It can't hurt to hear them out, order them to account for themselves."
xik.5.b:0 "Whatever their goals, they have far overstepped. Crush them."
xik.6.t:0 "Police Have Been Thrown Back!"
xik.6.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events the initial police assault upon the occupied station has failed to retake the building! Though the initial barricade has been torn down our police were stopped within the doorway as they were pelted from above and crushed by the surprisingly dedicated student mob. Thankfully no lethal weaponry was used despite fears that they may have gotten hold of the armory, but several men have been wounded regardless. Whatever the reason: unwillingness to harm students, shock at the energetic pushback, or just poor planning on the part of our over eager chief two things are clear: we need to train the men in riot control and the occupation is still not over."
xik.6.a:0 "If the police were too soft to do the job, the army will have to take a shot!"
xik.6.b:0 "One more chance for the men to redeem themselves. They were caught off guard is all"
xik.6.c:0 "This is pointless! Let's hear what they have to say: they have earned as much"
xik.7.t:0 "Success in full!"
xik.7.d:0 "Upon seeing the disciplined rows of uniformed soldiers, armed with lethal rifles and grenades, the fight went out of Liao. So, their statement had fell on deaf ears. The gamble had failed: Xikang would continue to be ruled by the shallow, the traitorous and the missguided and China would once more be stabbed in the back. With a heavy heart Liao rose to his feet and with hands above his head walked out of the station: he would not die for a failed cause.\n\nWith his surrender hardliners began to fight with those who attempted to follow Liao crying traitor, coward, and any other insult they could imagine. In this broken unity the troops swept into the station, quickly overwhelming the students with scarcely a shot fired. By the end of the day two students lay dead, one soldier had a nasty black eye and the police station had been freed."
xik.7.a:0 "Finally"
xik.8.t:0 "What to do with the prisoners?"
xik.8.desc:0 "We now have on our hands tens of students of varied well being waiting for their fate to be revealed to them. All that is left is for Wenhui to decide what the price of such insubordination should be."
xik.8.a:0 "Put them in prison until the war is over"
xik.8.b:0 "A public beating should suffice to remind these children to behave"
xik.8.c:0 "Simply expel them from their school, that's where these radicals come from"
xik.8.d:0 "They have learned their lesson: send them back home and let their parents know what happened"
xik.9.t:0 "The bonfire"
xik.9.d:0 "Disaster! The students resolve did not crack upon seeing the arrival of regular troops, and so the business of breaching and retaking the police station began. Room to room Wenhui's army proved more than a match for the amateur students until one made a most ill advised decision. Throwing a Zhdanov cocktail into the mass of soldiers the fire quickly spread out of control engulfing the first floor of the building as the troops quickly retreated from the blaze. The students were not so lucky as their own barricades caught them behind the flames and the police station quickly became a charnel house for the students.\n\nWhile a fire response team was immediately summoned and has ensured the flames will not spread to the city it is yet to be seen how many, if any, will be able to survive the blaze and the building itself has been gutted."
xik.9.a:0 "Horrible!"
xik.10.t:0 "Burying the corpses"
xik.10.d:0 "As the last embers guttered out retrieval work began its grizzly business. Through smoke inhalation, burning and even a suicide not one body has been found alive and most are unrecognizable. It seems that all there remains to do is find a resting place for the bodies."
xik.10.a:0 "Contact the families, it is only right."
xik.10.b:0 "Get rid of these bodies quickly and discreetly. This is not something to remember."
xik.9999.t:0 "Parents Vigil"
xik.9999.desc:0 "Today the families of the deceased have decided to hold a vigil in remembrance of the dead students. Holding lanterns and candles they have taken to the streets in somber silence bringing with them children, elderly and even a few effigies of their departed sons. No slogans, no chants, simply a deep and heart wrenching sense of loss presented to the darkened city. Gatherings of this size are illegal within Ya'an but it may be best to simply let this one pass. Especially as many members are rather affluent members of our society..."
xik.9999.a:0 "Politely, but firmly tell them to disperse. Now"
xik.9999.b:0 "Let them grieve without disturbance. Hopefully that will be the end of this."
xik.9999.c:0 "These people are important. Wenhui shall join them in their remembrance of this tragedy"
xik.11.t:0 "They threaten a bomb!"
xik.11.d:0 "The second attempt at forcing through the student mob has proven far more successful than the first, and after a brief but vicious battle of clubs and teargas most students have either been taken into custody or rendered unfit for continued resistance. Only a handful of students remain in revolt, and in desperation it seems they have turned to desperate measures. Who we can only assume to be the leader has threatened to blow up himself and anyone near him should any attempt be made on the boiler room he is barricaded in, and has put forth his demands for an audience with Wenhui. While it is unknown if the threat is credible most everyone is against Wenhui going any closer to the potential threat fearing an attempt on his life, for whatever reason. However there are a few who say this is the only way to deescalate the situation, and some who still think this was all unnecessary bloodshed in the first place..."
xik.11.a:0 "They're bluffing: breach the room. This ends now."
xik.11.b:0 "There are far better ways to kill a general than this. Let us try to talk the boy down."
xik.12.t:0 "The station retaken"
xik.12.d:0 ""
xik.13.t:0 "The students demand to see Wenhui!"
xik.13.d:0 "The police lieutenant sent to make contact with the besieged has returned somewhat flustered to us. The only message he claims they would give him was "The students shall only present their case to the general Wenhui, not to any third party." At the very least it has become clear that the besieged are students, a fact made all the clearer by the pleas of a bedraggled professor who begged for violence to not be used against his wayward students until being temporarily detained. We still are no closer to understanding the motivations of these students, nor do we know what they will do once Wenhui is in sight..."
xik.13.a:0 "We gave them a chance. Send in the assault." 
xik.13.b:0 "I asked for their statement, and I mean to get it. I'm going in"
xik.13.c:0 "Perhaps their teachers can talk some sense into them. The geologist seems honest."
xik.14.t:0 "Students want to meet elsewhere"
xik.14.d:0 "For the past few hours various faculty from the local university have pleaded with the student rebellion to stand down, or at least open a dialogue with them. It seems that their pleas, backed up by a show of force from the anxious police chief, have had some effect. When the school faculty returned to Wenhui's location the deal offered by the students had been altered. Though they still refused to speak with anyone but Wenhui himself they have agreed to leave the station unarmed on the condition that the general himself appear and give his word that he will hear their case."
xik.14.a:0 "They shall state their demands on our terms or not at all!"
xik.14.b:0 "This will get the students out of their fortifications at least."
xik.15.t:0 "Students refuse to move"
xik.15.d:0 "Perhaps expectedly negotiations have ground to a standstill as the students will hear no more reason. The chief of police has in the meantime become ever more shrill as rumours spread like wildfire across Ya'an and the students defensive measures grow ever tighter. There is nothing more to be done, the students must be dragged out by their hair and into the light of the law."
xik.15.a:0 "So be it: send in the men."
xik.16.t:0 "The Students Manifesto"
xik.16.d:0 ""
xik.16.a:0 "You dragged me all this way, nearly killed my police, and put the whole of Ya'an on lockdown... to lecture me about politics?!"
xik.16.b:0 "Whatever their ideas, it is clear that they are willing to go to extreme lengths to be heard. And that, I can respect."
xik.17.t:0 "How, and who, to punish"
xik.17.d_negatively:0 "This student mob has thrown the city into chaos and beaten our police simply to lecture their leader on politics! An example must be made of them and all eyes look to Wenhui for what the verdict on this insubordination shall be."
xik.17.d_sympathetically:0 "While their actions are treasonous it would be wrong to punish severely simply for an overabundance of patriotism. Additionally it is true that any other means of reaching Wenhui likely would have failed. But regardless the police are livid at this assault on themselves and their honor, and such violent disturbances cannot go without some response from the state..."
xik.17.a:0 "Toss them and their teachers in jail for years"
xik.17.b:0 "Lock up the students for years, punish the teachers" 
xik.17.c:0 "Lock up the students until the war ends"
xik.17.d:0 "Censure the students but no more"
xik.17.e:0 "Let them go free with only a reprimand" 
xik.17.f:0 "Let them go, and agree to a further meeting with their teachers at some point"

xik.50.t:0 "Not what we ordered"
xik.51.t:0 "Confronting the thief"
