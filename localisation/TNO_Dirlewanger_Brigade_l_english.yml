 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_OSKAR_DIRLEWANGER_DESC:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger, the bandit king, is perhaps the single most hated - and feared - man in Southern Russia. Standing at the head of his men, a collection of rapists, murderers, and savages without equal, he terrorizes all unfortunate enough to call the Southern Urals their home.\n\nA lifetime criminal opportunitst, Dirlewanger was imprisoned in 1934 for the rape of an underaged girl, and escaped only this and other later convictions through political connections and, in 1939, by his volunteering for service in the Waffen-SS. There, his depravity was found to be accompanied by a talent for effective, if brutal, leadership, resulting in his promotion to command what would become the first iteration of the so-called 'Dirlewanger Brigade.'\n\nDuring the war this unit, shielded by association with the SS, committed uncounted atrocities in the Eastern campaigns, burning and pillaging its way across Poland and Russia. These actions were repeated in the West Russian War, and what evidence of those actions survives make it clear that Dirlewanger's brutality and criminality only increased with time.\n\nHis life changed dramatically, however, in the aftermath of Himmler and the SS's failed coup. Opening fire on the Wehrmacht units that had arrived to disarm and imprison them, Dirlewanger and his men escaped into the Russian winter, eventually carving out a fiefdom in the Southern Urals from which they could pursue their greatest passions - plunder and blood.\n\nAt this, he and his Brigade are all too effective. But Dirlewanger has grown somewhat tired with ravaging nameless villages, and has his eyes set on the two prizes of the region: the city of Orenburg and the facilities on the Black Mountain. He thinks he would very much enjoy burning them to the ground.\n\nAfter taking everything of value, of course."

 POLITICS_FRITZ_SCHMEDES_DESC:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger is dead. But the Brigade, such as it is, limps on under the command of Fritz Schmedes, the only man capable of attempting to keep it together.\n\nExiled to the Brigade long ago following a dispute with Heinrich Himmler, and although he initially had worked hard to try and escape it, when it turned from a military unit into a bandit force he followed, and adapted. Perhaps tapping to a darkness that was always there, he quickly became almost as monstrous as his commander, working to plan and execute many of the Brigade's most daring raids.\n\nNow, with Dirlewanger dead and the Brigade in near-anarchy, Schmedes leads the crippled remnants that are still loyal, desperately trying to maintain some form of unity. However, with desertions increasing, splinter groups forming, and punitive expeditions increasingly launched against him, it would seem as though his efforts are doomed to failure."

 POLITICS_STEVE_DESC:0 "No last name, just Steve\n\nA Community College Student from Minnesota\n\nHe's very lost\n\nNot all who wander are lost- but Steve is.\n\nSteve is very lost\n\n\n\nStve has hypothermia."

 LEADER_FRITZ_SCHMEDES_DESC:0 "Fritz Schmedes was a good German, a loyal National Socialist, and a true believer in the superiority of the Aryan race. And it all mattered naught, for a dispute with Heinrich Himmler ended with him exiled to the Dirlewanger Brigade as punishment. When the Brigade abandoned the German cause and marched into the Russian wilderness, Schmedes followed. As the once-loyal German soldiers pillaged and raided like the bandits they were once conscripted to fight, Schmedes fought beside them. His seething anger and resentment for being sent here manifests itself in the cruelties he inflicts alongside the Brigade's other officers and men. Even if not by choice, Schmedes is a loyal son of Germany no longer. He is a monster like the rest."

 ORS_cornered_dog_desc:0 "With the fall of Lysenko and the Black Mountain to the Ural League, the Brigade truly is alone, entirely surrounded by those who would see it destroyed, not unlike a cornered dog with nowhere to run. But a cornered dog is extremely dangerous, for it has no reason not to fight with every ounce of strength it has. And the Brigade has a lot of strength indeed."
 ORS_enemies_on_all_sides:0 "Enemies on All Sides"
 ORS_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "We are in foreign lands, surrounded by enemies on all sides. But they don't know the truth: We're not trapped here with them, they're trapped here with us. Let them try and stand up to us, and see where it gets them. Lysenko's soldiers? The League's militias? Orenburg's anarchists? None of them have the guts to stand up to us, and none of them have the ability to fight us at our level besides. They might hide their fear for now, but they cannot do so forever."
 ORS_new_raids:0 "New Raid Preparation"
 ORD_new_raids_desc: "Soon, we will ride forth. Blood, fire, and plunder await, but we must first prepare ourselves.

 ORS_bandit_state_1:0 "Bandit State"

 ORS_to_the_slaughter:0 "To the Slaughter!"
 ORS_to_the_slaughter_desc:0 "Driven into a frenzy at the promise of loot and plunder, the men of the Brigade are on the warpath. On the attack, few can stand against them, even with preparation, and those that do not flee are often burned together with the villages they fruitlessly defend.\n\nAny battle with them will be a savage affair, with wanton laughter following closely behind any victory they earn."
 ORS_band_exhausted:0 "Exhausted Band"
 ORS_band_exhausted_desc:0 "Following the most recent raid, the Brigade is expended.

 ORS_think_tank_idea:0 "The Think Tank"
 ORS_think_tank_idea_desc:0 "At the Brigade's 'request,' Lysenko has dispatched some of his more junior scientists to its camps.\n\nThough they are of course wholly unsuited to any kind of hardships, and cannot be relied upon in any fight, they are very useful at coming up with solutions to problems the Brigade often can't be bothered to think about. That's enough."
 ORS_band_collapsed:0 "Collapsed Brigade"
 ORS_band_collapsed_desc:0 "With the death of Oskar Dirlewanger, the remnants of his Brigade are scattered and fractured, a mere shadow of their former selves.\n\nNo longer capable of operations of any real scale, they wait only for another force to sweep them aside, and claim Orsk for their own."

 ORS_the_black_bandits_of_the_south_desc:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger has led us to victory, and enrichment, against foes weak and strong, time and time again. From our 'service' within the SS, to our escape when the Wehrmacht tried to disarm us, to our capture of the lands around Orsk, he has always shown us the way.\n\nAnd that way is to take. We take what we want, and we want it all. Everything in the Southern Urals - wealth, women, land - belongs to us. It just hasn't been collected yet.\n\nWe're going to correct that."

 ORS_our_backs_to_the_wall:0 "Our Backs to the Wall"
 ORS_our_backs_to_the_wall_desc:0 "These lands might belong to us, but not everyone accepts that. The Ural League, a pathetic collection of communities led by a criminal priest, have hunted us time and again, and though we've evaded or destroyed their parties, more always come.\n\nOtherwise pinned between the madmen to the east, the steppes to the south, and the communes to the west, the League thinks they can destroy us once and for all. But what they don't know is that we have them right where we want them. We'll hold our own, bleed them dry and then, in time, strike back and take Orenburg.\n\nAnd when we do, they will truly learn why the Brigade is so feared."

 ORS_ready_the_boys:0 "Ready the Boys"
 ORS_ready_the_boys_desc:0 "Nobody in Russia, on either side of the Urals, is meaner, tougher, or stronger than the men of the Brigade. It's time to prove that once again.\n\nIn order to provide motivation, some of the previous spoils will be spread around. Loot, liquor, and the provision of women still capable of providing entertainment will remind them of what's to come.\n\nOur next 'expedition' is fast approaching, and they must be enthusiastic for it!"

 ORS_we_ride_or_die:0 "We Ride or Die"
 ORS_we_ride_or_die_desc:0 "Surrounded by enemies, by those who would think to stop us or end our right to plunder, we refuse to die like they so desperately hope! We take! We ride!\n\nWe ride over any man foolish enough to play soldier, over any village foolish enough to arm a militia, and over anyone else who dares to try and stop us. We'll find whatever - or whomever - they try to protect, and load it up over their corpses.\n\nGet ready, boys! We ride for plunder!"

 ORS_keep_them_fresh:0 "Keep Them Fresh"
 ORS_keep_them_fresh_desc:0 "The men of the Brigade are hard. But gorging on plunder, that ever present goal, has a disturbing tendency to turn them soft. A lazy bandit is a dead bandit, and we have no intention of dying.\n\nWe'll keep their beds hard, their barracks barely warm enough, and their liquor share sufficient, but only just. We'll keep them alert.\n\nAlert enough so that, when the command is given, they will eagerly jump for the chance to participate in another 'expedition.'"

 ORS_keep_them_happy:0 "Keep Them Happy"
 ORS_keep_them_happy_desc:0 "The Brigade exists because of enjoyment. Enjoyment of using that which was taken by force of arms from the cold, dead, hands of weaker men.\n\nWhat 'that' is - wine, women, drugs, games, books, or anything else at all - doesn't matter. The boss knows this very well, and so loot will be distributed and revelry encouraged.\n\nA happy bandit is always motivated to remain so, and will cheerfully obey any orders given in that pursuit."

 ORS_prepare_for_the_clash:0 "Prepare for the Clash"
 ORS_prepare_for_the_clash_desc:0 "It's coming, and soon.\n\nA big showdown with the Ural League is approaching, and we are going to destroy them. We are going to kill their men, rape Orenburg into the ground, in every way possible, and prove to everyone that nobody can stop the Brigade!\n\nAnd after that? Without the League around to organize defenses and provide 'advisors' to villages? Well, we'll loot the whole region. Who could stop us?"

 ORS_prepare_new_raids:0 "Prepare New Raids"
 ORS_prepare_new_raids_desc:0 "A lot of people think that the men of the Brigade are simple bandits, capable of nothing more than simple brutality in the pursuit of plunder. Most of those people are dead.\n\nWe may be brutal, and we may want to plunder, but we are no simpletons. Raids must be planned. Loot must be transported. Casualties must be managed. Terror must be applied in just the right fashion.\n\nDirlewanger, and the Brigade at large, have been doing this for years. And we will continue to do so, as we prepare for the biggest raids yet!"

 ORS_gather_our_loot:0 "Gather Our Loot"
 ORS_gather_our_loot_desc:0 "When the Brigade rides, it always returns with mountains of loot. But it also returns with the problem of keeping track of that loot.\n\nShares must be properly distributed, and even with the penalty known, some men always try to take more. This cannot be allowed to continue - every man gets a share, and the size of that share depends on many things. An inventory of all spoils must be meticulously generated, kept, and regularly updated.\n\nAfter all, how else will we know when it's time to go and take more?"

 ORS_prepare_for_the_spoils:0 "Prepare for the Spoils"
 ORS_prepare_for_the_spoils_desc:0 "Though it could not truly be considered a 'problem,' we frequently find that we have trouble storing all of the spoils of our many successful raids.\n\nThis causes trouble - without proper places to store everything we've taken, not only do we need to rapidly distribute or consume it, which causes discipline problems, but we find that thievery increases besides.\n\nTherefore, More depots will be constructed before our next raid. Hopefully, they'll fill up just as quickly!"

 ORS_the_black_bandit_on_the_black_mountain:0 "The Black Bandit on the Black Mountain"
 ORS_the_black_bandit_on_the_black_mountain_desc:0 "Even for the men of the Brigade, rumours about the insane experiments conducted by the mad scientist in Magnitogorsk are enough to give pause. But the boss sees only opportunity.\n\nWhatever else he might be, Lysenko is certainly no friend of the Ural League, and he has large deposits of weapons of all kinds. Weapons we want. We'll try and work out a deal for some of them.\n\nAnd, in time, we can look into what else he might have..."

 ORS_lysenkos_instruction:0 "Lysenko's Instruction"
 ORS_lysenkos_instruction_desc:0 "The deal with Lysenko has worked out even better than we could have hoped. Not only did he have weapons, but among the NKVD soldiers who defected to him there were several actual combat instructors.\n\nThe men of the Brigade may be expert raiders with an eye for the value of anything encountered, but many of them, especially our newer recruits, are woefully undertrained. We've therefore worked out an arrangement to send some of our people to go and learn some basic military particulars from those instructors.\n\nLet's see how much the League likes it when we next run into them!"

 ORS_organize_the_russians:0 "Organize the Russians"
 ORS_organize_the_russians_desc:0 "Dirlewanger might be an old hand at raiding, but he is also just that: old. Old and weak.\n\nOld bandits don't last long, and when they go down, so too does everybody who stays loyal to them. We will make this fact understood to the Russian members - the majority - of the Brigade, and work to bring them to our side. Increased shares, stolen spoils, and anything else necessary will be promised.\n\nWhen the time comes, Dirlewanger, and the few remaining non-Russians who remain loyal to him, will find themselves alone. And easy prey besides."

 ORS_expert_instruction:0 "Expert Instruction"
 ORS_expert_instruction_desc:0 "The Soviets might have lost their grand war against the Reich, but those of us still around from those times well remember how hard they fought, and how many Germans they killed, before capitulating.\n\nThey accomplished this through tough, uncompromising, and sometimes brutal training. Training that we now have access to, courtesy of Lysenko's instructors. And we intend to exploit it. As many of our men as possible will be sent to, hopefully, learn better and more efficient tactics.\n\nIf those tactics lead to more successful raids, so much the better."

 ORS_soviet_stratagem:0 "Soviet Stratagems"
 ORS_soviet_stratagem_desc:0 "The Soviets lost, but as the Russian members of the Brigade make sure to constantly emphasize, they were, and are, masters of deception. Of the maskirovka.\n\nThey used that mastery, many years ago, to sow confusion among both the Wehrmacht and their other enemies. Our enemies are smaller than the Soviets' were, but they are enemies all the same. If we can learn some of these strategies of deception, modify them to suit our purposes, and deploy them on our next raid, we could increase effectiveness significantly.\n\nOr, at the very least, give them less time to hide their valuables."

 ORS_soviet_arms:0 "Soviet Arms"
 ORS_soviet_arms_desc:0 "Many of the weapons secured for the Brigade from Lysenko's Magnitogorsk stockpiles are ancient beyond all measure. Some even bear the double-headed Russian Imperial Eagle!\n\nBut guns are guns, and as long as they can reliably shoot, they can be of value. We will distribute them to the men of the Brigade, starting with the newest recruits, freeing up better weapons for the veterans. If they prove themselves, and turn over the loot they find for distribution as is required, they can earn themselves a better weapon.\n\nAnd if they don't, there's always another recruit waiting."

 ORS_soviet_mastery:0 "Soviet Mastery"
 ORS_soviet_mastery_desc:0 "The Brigade has survived - and thrived - by understanding its environment. When we broke away from Germany, we had to adapt our doctrine, altering it to suit the Urals and our needs for raiding.\n\nWith our new deal in place, Lysenko's instructors are imparting to us Soviet tactics. Some of the smarter men have realized that combining the two - Soviet strength and discipline with the unorthodoxy and unpredictability of raiding maneuvers - could give us a real advantage over those who would see us destroyed.\n\nSo we will."

 ORS_lysenkos_promises:0 "Lysenko's Promises"
 ORS_lysenkos_promises_desc:0 "In exchange for his help, Lysenko demands much from the Brigade. Prisoners who could be put to work - in the base or on their back - or otherwise pressed into service have to be handed over unharmed.\n\nHe's paid us well for them so far, yes, but what else does that madman have, hidden away in his labs? In the depths of the Black Mountain?\n\nIt's time to find out, and see what other items he's willing to offer!"

 ORS_spoil_trucks:0 "Spoil Trucks"
 ORS_spoil_trucks_desc:0 "Our requests for 'alternative' forms of payment from Lysenko have borne fruit.\n\nThe first such form? Trucks, no doubt taken from the motor pool of the formations that defected alongside him. While the origin matters little to us, the effect matters much, much more. More trucks means that more gold, more grain, more women, more everything can be loaded up and brought back to our camps.\n\nTime to find some sleepy village where they can be put to use!"

 ORS_the_riches_of_the_mountain:0 "The Riches of the Mountain"
 ORS_the_riches_of_the_mountain_desc:0 "The Brigade continues to hand over valuable prisoners to Lysenko, and it's long past time that we remind him how valuable our continued assistance truly is.\n\nThere's more inside the Black mountain than he's shared with us so far, much more, and we want it! A little pressure, applied in just the right way, should encourage some additional cooperation and payment.\n\nIf Lysenko knows what's good for him, anyway."

 ORS_the_think_tank:0 "The Think Tank"
 ORS_the_think_tank_desc:0 "Lysenko's given us trucks, guns, and money. So why doesn't he give us back some of what we've been giving him - people?\n\nHe's got all kinds of scientists hidden away in his labs, and some of them must be less important than the others. Why doesn't he send them to us instead? He'll get more prisoners, and we'll get some eggheads that can move to both perform some 'field research' on prisoners and contribute to our own efforts besides.\n\nIt's too good a deal to pass up. We'll make sure Lysenko sees that."

 ORS_loot_the_universe:0 "Loot the Universe"
 ORS_loot_the_universe_desc:0 "Lysenko's made the right choices so far, giving us alternative and useful items for our prisoners, and now he's stepping up his normal payments as well!\n\nHe seems to be learning - the Brigade is happy to sell, but payment - considerable payment - is both required and expected. The latest such payment has arrived - more rifles and equipment, including heavier ordnance.\n\nIt's good stuff. Time to go use it!"

 ORS_lysenkos_strategy:0 "Lysenko's Strategy"
 ORS_lysenkos_strategy_desc:0 "People. It's all Lysenko cares about.\n\nMoney? He could care less. Territory? He has no use for it. Women? Not in the way we want them, that's for sure. No, all he wants are lots of people, marched to the Black Mountain in chains for use in whatever twisted experiments he has planned. Well, if that's what he wants, that's what he gets - as long as he can pay.\n\nIf he can, he can have the people he wants - and we can have the loot, both from them and him, that we want!"

 ORS_testing_our_enemies:0 "Testing Our Enemies"
 ORS_testing_our_enemies_desc:0 "The Brigade is surrounded by enemies. But that also means that we are surrounded by opportunities.\n\nThe Ural League, Orenburg, and countless small villages and settlements occupy the lands around us, all rich with loot just waiting for us to take it. We must be careful, however, as they are all waiting for us to make a mistake. Therefore, we will first test their strength, and see which of our foes offers the best opportunity.\n\nThen, and only then, will we ride to plunder!"

 ORS_strike_at_the_urals:0 "Strike at the Urals"
 ORS_strike_at_the_urals_desc:0 "The Ural League, our most vigorous enemy.\n\nAs much as we hate their pathetic mongrel 'state,' we cannot deny that their militias are effective and their communities well protected. On several occasions in the past they have even defeated us, and this is causing us trouble. We must prove that they are not capable of defending their territory, that they, like everyone else, fall before us.\n\nWe must put them in their place. And we will."

 ORS_strike_at_orenburg:0 "Strike Orenburg"
 ORS_strike_at_orenburg_desc:0 "The communes of Orenburg are disorganized and only loosely held together by shared anarchist ideals. In other words, they are perfect targets.\n\nUp until now, however, they have been the targets of our raids far less than the villages and settlements of the Ural League. This means that, unlike the places we have sacked before, they must be swollen with loot.\n\nTime to show them what the Brigade can do!"

 ORS_strike_at_the_peasantry:0 "Strike at the Peasantry"
 ORS_strike_at_the_peasantry_desc:0 "Though striking at settlements affiliated with either the League or Orenburg could yield good loot, there is one major problem: they can fight back.\n\nThough that usually isn't a problem, right now we'd rather not risk a defeat. The independent villages that dot the Southern Urals might not be wealthy, but they also have no real defenses. There won't be much loot, but there will be some, as well as women besides.\n\nThat will be enough for now."

 ORS_grab_the_healthy_fit_and_strong:0 "Grab the Healthy, Fit and Strong"
 ORS_grab_the_healthy_fit_and_strong_desc:0 "We raid for wealth, entertainment, and many other reasons, but one of the most valuable things we find is flesh.\n\nEvery single person we take captive during a raid can be utilized. Women can be used until they can be used no more, and men can either be put to work or, if they are strong enough, pressed into service. All can serve.\n\nAnd they will serve. Or they will die."

 ORS_draw_out_the_guard:0 "Draw out the Guard"
 ORS_draw_out_the_guard_desc:0 "At every turn, the Ural Guard frustrates our efforts, organizing defenses, training villagers into militia, and even striking at our camps in the night.\n\nIf we're going to, one day, utterly destroy them, and leave their lands open for plunder, we need to sap their strength first, and the maskirovka tactics we have recently learned can help here. A series of small raids should force them to commit their main force to action.\n\nAnd when they do, we will be waiting."

 ORS_the_battle_of_novotroitsk:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk"
 ORS_the_battle_of_novotroitsk_desc:0 "Our gambit worked!\n\nThe raids we conducted on the League's outlying villages have drawn them out, moving to erect defenses around the town on Novotroitsk in anticipation of an engagement. But they still think they will only be fighting another raiding force, and have deployed themselves accordingly.\n\nThey have no idea what's coming."

 ORS_the_second_phase:0 "The Second Phase"
 ORS_the_second_phase_desc:0 "The Ural League's forces were smashed at Novotroitsk, drawn in by our deception, and this gives us an opportunity.\n\nTheir militias are depleted, their defensive lines breached, and their fortresses exposed. We will likely not see such momentary weakness again, and we must move to take advantage. Additional raids will be launched on these fortresses to ensure their destruction.\n\nAnother great raid approaches, and when it does, the League will not be able to interfere!"

 ORS_lessons_of_the_guard:0 "Lessons of the Guard"
 ORS_lessons_of_the_guard_desc:0 "We secured much loot from the League's fortresses, but we also took prisoners.\n\nThough we would usually hand them over to Lysenko, or just dispose of them altogether, we should not forget how useful the training our men previously received was. We'll give them a very simple choice: teach us how the League trains and fights, or die. Surely, some of them will be willing to give us lessons.\n\nAnd then we can, and will, use those lessons against their former friends."

 ORS_ural_expertise:0 "Ural Expertise"
 ORS_ural_expertise_desc:0 "The Ural League captives, those smart enough to take us up on our offer at least, have been very helpful.\n\nThe lands of the League are rugged and mountainous, and they've given us some useful instruction on how to best handle them. So useful, in fact, that some of the Brigade think they should be given an offer to stay, and join us more permanently.\n\nThey can always refuse, of course.

 ORS_maintain_order_desc:0 "The Brigade is a motley crew of ex-convicts turned German soldiers turned bandits and the scum of the southern Urals who also have nowhere to turn to in 'civilized' society. In short, they're fucking animals, and just like animals require constant watch lest they go out of control. Dirlewanger's preferred method is keeping everyone on their toes, if you're more likely to die for stepping out of line than you are in a battle, you won't step out of line. So Dirlewanger claims anyways, when he's sober enough to speak coherently at all. Still, someone once said you catch more flies with honey, and they might be right. Maybe the boys would benefit from an uplifting pep-talk or two. Tell them about the loot, drugs, and women they'll have if they just stick with us and maybe we can keep this whole thing moving forward as long as possible."

 ORS.01.t:0 "The Dirlewanger Brigade"
 ORS.01.desc:0 "The 36th Waffen-Grenadier Division of the SS, better known as the Dirlewanger Brigade, or now as the Black Bandits, is easily one of the most infamous formations ever to exist.\n\nFormed out of a collection of criminals, madmen, collaborators, and whoever else was monstrous enough to join, it was initially designated as a counter-insurgency unit, and quickly developed such a barbarous reputation that even other SS units wanted little to do with them.\n\nIn the aftermath of the West Russian War and the failure of Himmler's SS-led coup attempt, the Brigade fled across the Reich's eastern borders in advance of Wehrmacht units dispatched by Spiedel to disarm them. Settling in around the city of Orsk, the Brigade established a rapacious bandit 'state' that ever since has terrorized and brutalized the people of the Southern Urals in the pursuit of plunder, trading on its German equipment and training to provide a decisive advantage.\n\nFeared and loathed by all around them, the Brigade has three primary objectives: acquire loot and plunder by raiding those around them, assert their supremacy in the region, and, ultimately, utterly sack the city of Orenburg.\n\nConsidering the chaotic nature of Russia in general and the Southern Urals in particular, they may well succeed, unless one of their enemies manages to devise a way to stop them..."

The massacre is near-total, with tens of thousands dead at our hands, thousands more sure to die from exposure or starvation, and more still scattered to the villages and settlements yet untouched - which will not remain so for long.\n\nAs fleeing defenders are ridden down by the Brigade's Kazakh horsemen, and rivers of blood flow outwards from the sacked city, all will know the inevitable fate of those who would deny us our spoils! And all will also know that we will not stop here. All of Russia will bleed before we are through! \n\nFor plunder! For the Brigade! For Dirlewanger!"

 ORS.162.t:0 "Black Mountain Treachery"
 ORS.162.desc:0 "Initially, the meeting with those mountain-top creeps held a tone of optimism. Dirlewanger received an invitation written by Lysenko personally, scribbled in hasty German on brown-stained parchment. Of course Dirlewanger saw through this farce and opted to humor the mad scientist with his presence. At first the meeting seemed cordial by Uralic standards, a lone table amidst the tundra and mysterious meat smoking over a humble fire. Even Lysenko's men were pleasant with their offers of conversation and faux smiles. That all changed in a moment, however, when the Lysenko's rabid dogs released their anger upon the brigade. Amidst gunfire and chaos, Dirlewanger managed to dive into the cab of a Brigade truck and, under suppressing fire from fellow Brigademen, managed to escape unscathed. It was a relief to all the Brigade when he returned as the sole survivor of this horrible act of deceit. One thing is for sure, relations between those mad mountaineers and our Brigade have taken a turn for the far worse."
 ORS.162.a:0 "Outsmarted again!"

 ORS.200.t:0 "Missed a Few"
 ORS.200.desc:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger, leader of the infamous Dirlewanger Brigade, was killed by a partisan group yesterday. As he was on his way to a meeting with Lysenko, a small band of ex-NKVD partisans ambushed him and his men, killing Dirlewanger himself as well as several members of the Brigade.\n\nWhile the Brigade has exacted revenge on the village where this took place, without Dirlewanger at the helm, the Brigade has all but splintered. Various factions have already begun breaking off to terrorize the Urals, though it is likely they will find no quarter anywhere in Russia."
 ORS.200.a:0 "A fitting end to that madman."

 ORS.201.t:0 "Testing Our Enemies"
 ORS.201.d:0 "The efforts of Dirlewanger and the Brigade's senior officers to prepare for the next major raid have been successful.\n\nEquipment has been prepared, plans have been drawn, and the men have been made ready, with the deliberate encouragement of internal disagreements in order to provoke ferocity and a desire for blood. The only question is where to strike, and three options have been presented for consideration.\n\nThe first, and most ambitious, would be to strike the lands around Orenburg, trusting in surprise and skill to overcome their defenses and shatter their illusion of strength. The second, and more obvious target, would be Ural League-affiliated settlements. We fight the League on a near-constant basis, and targeting their morale and resources would be of great help in the future.\n\nFinally, and as a third option, Lysenko has informed us that his forces would not interfere were we to launch a raid against peasant communities within his territory, likely believing it an opportunity to acquire desired prisoners without inciting unrest against himself. They would be unlikely to offer any real resistance, but it is unclear if there would be all that much to gain from them.\n\nRegardless, however, a decision must be made."
 ORS.201.a:0 "Whoever we choose will fall!"

 ORS.202.t:0 "Strike at Orenburg"
 ORS.202.d:0 "Dirlewanger has decided: the Brigade rides on Orenburg.\n\nNot the city itself - we are not quite yet prepared for that - but on a town just across the border. The raid is intended not only to capture whatever wealth and prisoners the town can provide, of course, but also to test the overall defensive capabilities of the state as a whole.\n\nIt is expected that while any individual commune, such as the town, might provide strong resistance, the inherently chaotic nature of anarchism will prevent reinforcement within reasonable timelines. We shall see.\n\nIn any case, the promise of blood and plunder has excited the men as a whole, who eagerly await the battle to come, and the division of loot that is sure to follow."
 ORS.202.a:0 "Ready the men!"

 ORS.203.t:0 "Strike at Orenburg - The Raid Succeeds!"
 ORS.203.d:0 "Our raid on Orenburg was, as hoped, a complete success.\n\nUnder cover of night, our men approached the town from multiple sides, establishing overlapping fields of fire while also acting to block any routes of escape. A small force acted to distract the defending militia and lure them out of established positions, and once that goal had been achieved, our main force, commanded by Dirlewanger himself, fell upon them from ambush.\n\nThe battle was quick, with the militia swiftly overwhelmed and slaughtered, with the Brigade's Cossack and Kazakh riders slaughtering those few who attempted to flee. And then their, as well as the rest of the force's attention, was turned onto the town itself.\n\nEverything of value was seized, large numbers of prisoners were taken for trade or personal entertainment, and intelligence on the dispositions of other communes was acquired. Once completed, those inhabitants deemed too old, young, sick, or otherwise not worth the effort to transport were corralled in the town hall before it was set ablaze along with the rest of the settlement.\n\nAll of the Brigade's objectives have been accomplished - loot, slaughter, prisoners, and terror - and as word of this raid spreads, our dread reputation can only grow."
 ORS.203.a:0 "Fire or Lysenko - which is a worse fate?"

 ORS.204.t:0 "Strike at Orenburg - The Raid Fails!"
 ORS.204.d:0 "The attack on Orenburg was known to be risky, and this time that risk proved too much. The Brigade's attack failed. Utterly.\n\nA failure somewhere allowed for the commune to somehow learn about our impending raid, and they were able to, before our arrival, secure considerable reinforcement. Our attempts at distraction and ambush were wholly unsuccessful, and when our main force advanced out of cover they were immediately engaged by pre-sighted machine guns and overlapping fields of fire.\n\nThe field commander, apparently consumed with rage, ordered continued advance, and though our men eventually overran the commune's outer defenses, they took horrific casualties, and were soon routed by additional militia forces fortified within the town itself. Perhaps knowing what we had in store for them if victorious, very few of our men were permitted to escape, most being shot down as they fled.\n\nDirlewanger himself is furious, and has ordered the commander who gave the order to advance shot, along with any of his senior subordinates who survived.\n\nThough the Brigade can recover its manpower and equipment in time, it is not yet known if we can recover the damage to our dread reputation that this failure has inflicted."
 ORS.204.a:0 "A defeat, to be sure."

 ORS.205.t:0 "Strike at the Ural League"
 ORS.205.d:0  "Dirlewanger has decided: The Brigade rides on the Ural League.\n\nThe League has long been our most committed enemy, and many of our men have lost comrades to them at one time or another, leading to great enthusiasm for any action taken to bring them harm. Harm that is soon to come, as our scouts have identified an excellent target: an occupied prison that the Ural Guard uses for training new militia recruits in methods of village defense.\n\nThough the Guard always fights with determination, and the instructors and senior cadres present at the prison will no doubt do so in even greater fashion, the opportunity cannot be ignored. By killing their recruits we will not only strike at the morale of their rank and file, but may dissuade others from joining them. In addition, our own men will both acquire excellent combat experience as well as improve their techniques for attacking League fortifications and installations.\n\nThe raid will commence soon. To victory!"
 ORS.205.a:0 "We're breaking INTO a prison?"

 ORS.206.t:0 "Strike at the Ural League - The Raid Succeeds!"
 ORS.206.d:0 "Many of the Brigade found the thought of attacking a prison ironic, yet still they approached it with the skill and determination that has made us feared all across the Southern Urals.\n\nIn the dead of night, infiltration specialists, former members of the Waffen-SS, gained entry through the prison's sewer system, and coordinated their assault with that from our main force outside. Attacked from both within and without, the Ural Guard were quickly overwhelmed, many being unable to even reach their weapons.\n\nThough we were victorious, it would appear that the Guard had planned for even such a contingency, as our men, advancing into the fortress, found defensive positions abandoned and evidence of the existence of a number of escape routes. Escape routes that were used when it was clear we were winning.\n\nThough we subsequently inflicted far fewer casualties upon the Guard than expected, we have secured both the base and the armories contained within. We have also proven that even the Guard's most powerful fortresses are not safe from us.\n\nEmphasizing this fact, Dirlewanger ordered the few prisoners taken flayed and hanged from the walls, before we set the buildings alight and retreated with our captured spoils. We have proven our point.\n\nFor now."
 ORS.206.a:0 "The Guard are not invincible."

 ORS.207.t:0 "Strike at the Ural League - The Raid Fails!"
 ORS.207.d:0 "Although we do not yet have all the information, the situation is clear: our strike at the Ural League failed in its objectives. Completely.\n\nBy all accounts, the attack enjoyed initial success, with former Waffen-SS infiltration specialists entering the prison and coordinating their strike on the garrison with our main attack. However, they were unable to secure critical points, including the radio room and armory, in time to prevent the defenders from solidifying their position.\n\nAs a result, the attack turned into a bloodbath, with each position only taken by our forces after a brutal close-quarters fight. Though we did technically 'win,' securing the fortress after many hours and horrendous casualties, the victory can hardly be called such.\n\nMany of our best men are dead, everything of value was either expended or destroyed in the fighting, and the story of the Guard's 'bravery' in opposing our attack is already spreading, no doubt sure to inspire stiff resistance elsewhere. There will, must, be a reckoning for this failure.\n\nDirlewanger will make sure of it."
 ORS.207.a:0 "For certain, there are more deaths to come."

 ORS.208.t:0 "Strike at the Peasants"
 ORS.208.d:0 "Dirlewanger has decided: The Brigade will ride on the peasant settlements around Magnitogorsk.\n\nThough not a particularly dangerous - or lucrative - enemy, and thus unable of inspiring in our men the usual aggression and enthusiasm usually desired for a raid, none can, or would dare, argue that it is not a safe choice.\n\nThough the villages will not have much within them to carry away, absent the people themselves, they should at least provide good sport, and allow us to avoid much planning besides. Lysenko has already informed us that his forces will not intervene, and so we will only need to concern ourselves with whatever pathetic militia the villages attempt to assemble.\n\nIt is time to get to the bloody, and sometimes monotonous, work of killing those who cannot fight back."
 ORS.208.a:0 "A safe choice."

 ORS.209.t:0 "Strike at the Peasants - The Raid Succeeds!"
 ORS.209.d:0 "As expected - the alternative was laughable even to consider - our raid on the Magnitogorsk peasants was a total success.\n\nThe few villages targeted, abandoned by their own supposed protector in Lysenko, stood no chance, with the few men brave enough to pick up weapons killed almost where they stood. The Brigade descended upon them like locusts, often in little more than a mob and absent any real tactics, for such were not needed.\n\nEverything of value, little as it was, was captured, and the people of the villages were processed. Healthy men and women, or at least those women still healthy after our men were through, were loaded up for transport to the Black Mountain, and those deemed unfit were butchered. The children we will keep for ourselves, as new recruits, those made impressionable by youth, are always needed.\n\nWhile we cannot call this raid a great victory, and it will likely be forgotten about in due time, we can at least say that we have profited, and for the Brigade, that is always the goal."
 ORS.209.a:0 "Exactly as expected."

 ORS.210.d:0 "We have no idea how this went wrong. We sent in some of the most brutal bastards the world has ever seen against simple peasants in one of the most unremarkable villages in Russia and yet somehow we were beaten back. Our commanders for once are not even bickering about whose fault this was, all in a shock of bafflement about how this happened at all. The only thing we are certain of is that for simple peasants the village was oddly well armed, and certain villagers oddly well trained in uncommon weaponry. This has caused speculation that Lysenko might have violated our agreement and in fact sent aid to the village in some sort of power play against us. With our defeat however we have no evidence of this, and Dirlewanger is unwilling to press his suspicions whilst the Ural League and Orenburg still exist. For now, we must just lick our wounds, and prepare for next time."

 ORS.211.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk"
 ORS.211.d:0 "Despite all our victories against the Ural League, its Guard, and other organizations, we have yet to secure a decisive victory. Something that can give us the advantage on a large scale. That changes now.\n\nThe Brigade's scouts have reported that the Ural Guard have established a large concentration of forces around the industrial town of Novotroitsk, no doubt in order to protect the extraction of the rare and extremely valuable composite ores that are located there. Ores that are no doubt critical to the League, both for their own military production and for trade to acquire that which they cannot make themselves.\n\nWe must have this prize, and similarly deny it to them. It will be a bloody, and difficult, battle, against some of the Ural League's best fighters, but the reward is worth it. Dirlewanger himself believes it, and that is, in the end, what matters.\n\nWe will prepare our plan, we will engage the Guard, and once they fall, we will unleash ourselves on Novotroitsk, and take everything it has!"
 ORS.211.a:0 "Ready the men!"

 ORS.212.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - The Outskirts"
 ORS.212.d:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk began as our formations approached it, covered by early-morning fog, and began an artillery bombardment of the Ural Guard's outer positions.\n\nGiven the importance of the battle, Dirlewanger had authorized the use of heavy equipment and ammunition reserves not typically accessed, and thus the bombardment, conducted in waves, was one that we knew our enemies did not expect. By the time it ended, three hours later, it was clear that the defenders had been significantly weakened. And then our men were sent in.\n\nThe outer defensive works were quickly taken, but our push into Novotroitsk's suburbs was more strongly resisted, with machine gun fire, from prepared positions, slowing the advance. In the field himself, Dirlewanger ordered smokescreens deployed while flamethrower teams moved to successfully burn out the gun nests.\n\nAlthough it took several more hours to properly secure the rest of the outskirts, the outcome was inevitable, and the Brigade's command post has been moved forward in anticipation of the nest push, into the industrial districts ahead."
 ORS.212.a:0 "This is shaping up to be a good day."

 ORS.213.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - The Industrial District"
 ORS.213.d:0 "The push into Novitroitsk's industrial areas was critical, since, as the Brigade has often learned to its fury, the Ural Guard would sooner destroy what it possesses than allow us to claim them as our spoils.\n\nAnd, so, our advance into the district was started as soon as our hold on the outskirts was cemented, capitalizing on the momentum possessed. Unfortunately, however, a quick victory was denied us, and brutal fighting, often at close quarters and sometimes in melee, carried on through the afternoon and into the night. Alongside explosions that we knew belonged to the Guard's sabotage teams.\n\nAs the sun rose on the next morning Dirlewanger, enraged at the loss of valuable plunder, ordered an all-out assault, leading to yet another long day of close quarters fighting. A day that in the end, however, brought victory.\n\nThe Brigade has secured the district, but at great cost and with much of it left in ruins. A victory is a victory however, and must be capitalized on. The last area of Novotroitsk that must be taken is the town center, and we move to do so.\n\nImmediately."
 ORS.213.a:0 "The boys had a blast."

 ORS.214.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - The Town Center"
 ORS.214.d:0 "Operating from our positions in both the suburbs and the industrial zones, the Brigade began its final push on Novotroitsk's town center, intended to finally break the Ural Guard's resistance, alongside the sunrise.\n\nUsing sniper and artillery fire, our forces frustrated attempts by the Guard to affect civilian evacuation, ensuring future captives while also causing obstructions for the Guard themselves. This distraction also allowed elements to advance closer than before under less fire, and thus when the final assault began, it did so from a superior tactical position.\n\nDespite this, however, the Guard resisted fiercely, and close quarters, room-to-room combat became the norm as we moved closer to the town hall itself. As ammunition was expended, rifles and submachine guns became clubs, and debris was turned into improvised weapons. Indeed, and in spite of the hopelessness of the Guar's position, so determined was their defense that it took two further days to break.\n\nBut break it did. With a final push, a shock element of our own stormed the Guard's command post in the town hall and killed the officers within. Organized defense collapsed shortly thereafter, and as the Brigade's flag was unfurled above it, a great cheer rose.\n\nWe have certainly earned this victory - now it is time to enjoy it!"
 ORS.214.a:0 "Victory is ours!"

 ORS.215.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - Victory"
 ORS.215.d:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk is over, and the Brigade has, once again, emerged victorious.\n\nAs the last of the Ural Guard's positions were overrun, and those few foolish enough to attempt surrender shot where they stood, the aftermath began. Novotroitsk may be a larger settlement than the Brigade is used to sacking, containing far more people, but the procedure remains the same, and our men are very, very experienced at following it.\n\nAny civilians who had aided the Guard were immediately shot, along with their families. The strongest of those who remained were concentrated together, ready for transport to forced labor camps either in the town itself or in our other territories. Buildings were first ransacked for anything of value, and then burned down in order to send a message. Women were abducted wholesale.\n\nIn the town centre, Dirlewanger himself gave a jubilant speech on a balcony overlooking a bonfire - into which the corpses of the Ural Guard were thrown. The valuables and resources of the town will be a great boon to the Brigade, but the boost in morale is potentially an even greater reward."
 ORS.215.a:0 "The Guard should have stayed in their fortresses."

 ORS.216.t:0 "The Battle of Novotroitsk - Defeat"
 ORS.216.d:0 "Despite our best efforts in the planning, preparation, and execution of our attack on Novotroitsk, the Brigade has been defeated by the Ural Guard.\n\nOur men fought like those possessed, taking much of the town, but resistance proved too strong and with their energy spent they were vulnerable to counterattack. A counterattack which the Guard executed the moment they were able.\n\nTo their credit, the men held out, inflicting grievous casualties in brutal close combat, but in the end they were forced to withdraw lest they face utter annihilation. Our defeat, however, is not total, for the town and the extraction works around it are all but destroyed, impeding their war efforts for a significant period.\n\nStill, this is not the victory we wanted. The victory we deserved. And we must now return to Orsk in that most terrible of conditions - empty-handed."
 ORS.216.a:0 "Bloody, and ultimately pointless."

 ORS.217.t:0 "The Second Phase"
 ORS.217.d:0 "We have been waiting for this day for a very long time, indeed.\n\nThe Ural Guard's defeat at Novotroitsk has left them, at least for the moment, scattered and disorganized, unable to mount effective defense or counterattack. As such, the lands they claim to protect, especially along their borders, are wide open for the Brigade to pillage, and pillage we shall!\n\nIn addition to wealth, women, prisoners, and other items of value, Dirlewanger and his officers have issued specific orders to secure any and all military equipment found. We will, eventually, have to face that madman Lysenko, and the fortifications of the Guard contain much, including heavy weapons and artillery pieces, that could help us when that day comes.\n\nIn addition, the other supplies to be captured, especially foodstuffs from the many farms left equally unprotected, will allow us both to replenish our depleted stocks and establish a strategic reserve.\n\nA reserve that will keep us going for some time. Things are looking up, indeed."
 ORS.217.a:0 "Take it all!"

 ORS.218.t:0 "A Second Great Raid"
 ORS.218.d:0 "Victory breeds complacency, and this is no different for the Brigade. Our men, hardened and skilled, are getting bored with the small-scale raids we have made in recent days. Bored raiders are dangerous raiders, to both friend and foe, and the officers understand this well.\n\nThe decision has therefore been made to carry out a second great raid, and secure much new plunder!. And, just as before, there are three primary options for our officers to choose between.\n\nOrenburg, as always, is the great prize of the Urals, bloated with prisoners, wealth, and 'entertainment' of all kinds. Our men speak of it always, often in hushed tones, and would jump at the chance to ride towards it once again.\n\nThe second group of targets lie in the lands of the Ural League. Though not as wealthy, no group in the region provokes more hatred from our men as the League and its Guard, and that thirst for revenge will no doubt motivate the Brigade to new heights of aggression and slaughter.\n\nFinally, and by far the most ambitious, is the third option. It has been proposed to strike Orenburg and the Ural League both. It would be difficult, to put it mildly, and a great risk, but the reward, both in loot and in dread reputation and fame, would be enormous, and would weaken both our enemies besides."
 ORS.218.a:0 "Excitement builds."

 ORS.219.t:0 "Draw Out the Guard"
 ORS.219.d:0  "The Ural Guard, celebrated by peasants as heroes across the Southern Urals, even far beyond the League's borders, are getting too full of themselves. Every time our men enter their territory, they arrive to stand against us, fighting with utter tenacity. But it is time to show the people that the Guard are not invincible, and that nobody can protect them from us.\n\nWe will launch a series of raids into their lands in order to, if they want to keep their reputation of protection, draw their cowardly garrisons out of their fortresses and into the open. Where they will be vulnerable to attack.\n\nWe will pick a time and place, and then when they are right where we want them, we will strike from all sides and slaughter them to the last man. Surrender will not be offered or accepted, and when the people see the bodies left behind they will know they are truly alone."

 ORS.220.t:0 "Demand Double - Lysenko Sends Half."
 ORS.220.d:0 "Lysenko, that freak, received our demand for double payment for the last group of captives. And refused.\n\nThe message sent in response, delivered by a very unhappy looking NKVD officer, detailed this refusal, and further warned us that any additional attempts to 'impress' upon him our position of strength could mean a decisive end to the arrangement we have established.\n\nHe is, at least, smart enough to understand that to leave us empty-handed would be a grave mistake, and has sent half of the originally agreed upon payment. Lysenko still has his usefulness to us, but he should make no mistake that we are not happy.\n\nAnd that we will not forget this insult."
 ORS.220.a:0 "We gambled, and we lost."

 ORS.250.t:0 "Transfer the Flesh"
 ORS.250.d:0 "The deal between the Brigade and Lysenko is, at its core, simple.\n\nWe hand over as many prisoners as possible, captured in our many raids as either a primary objective or as a side spoil, for whatever insane experimentations he has planned for them. In return, he transfers a share of the advanced military equipment and other technological wonders of the Black Mountain to our forces.\n\nThough one could not claim that our men are honest, they are, mostly, content with this arrangement. Some, however, complain. And not without cause. They claim that we are doing all of the work, and taking all of the losses, wily Lysenko sits up on his mountain in safety and with his secrets. They say that we deserve a bigger piece of the pie, and that it would be easy to impress this desire upon him, despite the risk to the deal as a whole that it could bring.\n\nSome of our officers are starting to listen. Should we encourage this?"
 ORS.250.a:0 "Decisions, decisions."

 ORS.251.t:0 "Hand Them Over"
 ORS.251.d:0 "Nobody could, or would, deny that Lysenko is a strange one. That does not mean he is stupid, and he ensures his own security by only ever personally appearing to deal with Dirlewanger himself.\n\nPersonnel transactions are always overseen by one of his functionaries, and today was no different. Our men, arriving with the latest group of captives taken were met by one such functionary, and given the decision not to press for more from the Black Mountain, business proceeded as usual. The chattel were then led away, towards whatever end Lysenko and his mad cabal had in mind for them, and truckloads of equipment were brought forward in payment.\n\nWe were, unfortunately, given no choice in exactly what was exchanged, as Lysenko had apparently already compiled and pre-approved a list. Not all of it is perfectly suited for our needs, but enough of it is, and everything is of sufficient quality besides.\n\nIt will do. For now."
 ORS.251.a:0 "There must be honor amongst thieves."

 ORS.252.t:0 "The Deal Changed - Lysenko Agrees"
 ORS.252.d:0 "Our man at Black Mountain has sent back word that Lysenko has surrendered to our demands for an increased payment for the captives we are delivering. We get the impression he is by no means pleased by our sudden change of heart, but we don't really care if he likes it or not. All that matters is that the madman caved like the cowardly creature he is, and extra supplies will reach our boys from now on."
 ORS.252.a:0 "Slavery is a lucrative business."

 ORS.253.t:0 "The Deal Changed"
 ORS.253.d:0 "Lysenko is, undeniably, a pretty weird guy. He rarely seems to leave his laboratories, more of a cowering creature than a man. He never deals with anyone from our side other than Dirlewanger himself, alway sending one of his equally weird 'assistants' to oversee the transactions between us. Today, as our slavemaster arrived at Black Mountain with our latest haul of captives, it was business as usual.\n\nThat was the case at least until one of the scientists remarked how impressed they were with the number of 'specimens' we were providing, to which our man replied it was easy when we have as many men as we do, ready to fight anywhere, and anyone, at a moments notice.\n\nWorried by the possible implication, Lysenko's lackeys tried to wrap the deal up quickly. But with Dirlewanger's authorization, our man informed them the deal had changed. We have been taking the risks, so we want more than the previously negotiated amount. The 'or else' was not said, but clearly implied.\n\nLyseko's assistant has retreated, claiming the demand can only be accepted or denied by the mad scientist himself."
 ORS.253.a:0 "Brains versus brawn, it seems."

 ORS.254.t:0 "The Deal Changed - Lysenko Stands Firm."
 ORS.254.d:0 "Having sent our slavemaster to Black Mountain, we expected that he would come back victorious with extra spoils now we have decided to confront Lysenko on the matter of the value of our prisoners. What we did not expect, however, was that Lysenko would actually have a spine when threatened.\n\nToday we received the charred bodies of our slavemasters bodyguards, the slavemaster himself having vanished from the face of the earth as far as we can tell. Accompanying the bodies was a written note from Lysenko claiming that the group had attempted to change the regular deal when they arrived, which Lysenko was 'certain was against their orders, going by our previous agreements' and was a simple 'matter of thuggish extortion'.\n\nAs punishment Lysenko 'exterminated' them, and has informed us due to our 'inability to install discipline in our dignitaries' that we will be receiving no payment for this batch of captives at all, which we will not be getting back either."

 ORS.255.d:0 "Our favorite freak Lysenko has caved to our demands for double the payment for the latest batch of captives, the supplies finally reaching us today. Apparently whilst displeased at our extortion attempt, he is of the opinion that the better supplied we are the more of our joint enemies we will be able to kill. He has no idea we will indeed use this equipment to kill our enemies, Lysenko himself among them."
 ORS.255.a:0 "We'll put these to good use alright."

 ORS.256.t:0 "Harry the Stragglers"
 ORS.256.d:0 "The fire of our hearts is consuming the lands of the Ural League, burning hotter and brighter with each passing day. Now their people are refugees, fleeing as fast as their little feet can carry them from our advance. During the days our scouts stalk their columns of broken vermin, trudging forth with sorrow in their eyes and defeat in their hearts. At night, when they seek some small respite in sleep, our men descend to awaken them to a nightmare. We kill their men with savagery, relieve our frustrations with their women, and take their children to serve us. Any supplies they have are taken before we finally just burn it all to the ground. At night our men no longer navigate by the stars, but by the fires across the land."
 ORS.256.a:0 "Ust-Katav will be our north star."

 ORS.257.t:0 "The World Turned Upside Down!"
 ORS.257.d:0 "It was a fools notion, that all those pathetic communes would ever be able to mount any kind of defense against us. They were living in a fantasy, but we have forced them to realize the truth of their utopia. They thought the Ural Guard would protect them, it was as a lie. They thought their leaders would protect them, it was a lie. They thought, at the very least, they could protect each other...but it was a lie. The landscape is filled with the ashen husks of these communes, littered with the dead and pillaged of all valuables. So often we find that their people have chosen to die by their own hand rather than ours when we arrive, and we relish in it for they have finally seen our truth. The fantasy is over, their utopia has fallen."
 ORS.257.a:0 "They belonged in a children's book, not life."

 ORS.258.t:0 "Salt the Earth!"
 ORS.258.d:0 "Ever since there were armies, their commanders have usually realised that an army only marches on its stomach. They may want for much more, but they need their food. We have come across crop fields aplenty in Orenburg's lands, enough to feed our army well. They certainly need it with all the effort they've been putting in to kill these miserable people. But just as our army marches on its stomach, so does theirs. And so we shall leave nothing for them!\n\nOur boys have set to work throwing salt into the earth after we have taken the crops, as well as filling them with landmines. Wells have been poisoned, often by dropping dead cattle inside. Irrigation and waterways have been destroyed. Pipes have been ripped up from the ground, wires ripped from the walls. We have taken the spoils of this land, and now no-one will ever be able to use it again."
 ORS.258.a:0 "We are the end times."

 ORS.259.t:0 "Let All Know Fear..."
 ORS.259.d:0 "We have come to a most delicious realization; we have inflicted such horror and terror on these people that we have begun to cross the line into myth. It all started with a scouts report that a grandmother had told her grandson that if he did not eat, Dirlewanger would come and snatch him away. We kept our ears open, and heard so much more.\n\nApparently our horses charge in with hooves of blazing fire. Dirlewanger has burning coals for eyes, rotten skin and the legs of a goat. Our men have superhuman strength and the genitalia of horses. Our weapons were blessed by the devil himself to inflict as much pain as possible. We take our prisoners and sacrifice them to Hitler, who has ascended to godhood following his death. We are so powerful because we have the ability to raise the dead after each battle to swell our corrupted ranks.\n\nThese are all highly entertaining, but more importantly, are proof that we will live on in history as utter villains, right where we wanted to be. Our names will last a thousand years!"

 ORS.260.t:0 "The Plot Begins..."
 ORS.260.d:0 "As terrifying as the SS truly are, they have one fatal weakness. Just like the rest of us, they are only human. With each year passed, with each battle fought, more and more of the original members of Dirlewanger's brigade have died, forcing them to accept more and more local recruits. Recruits who know all too well the brutality and horrors inflicted upon their country and themselves at the hands of the Germans. The time has come to extract our revenge, bring down Dirlewanger and kick these German scum out of our lands!"
 ORS.260.a:0 "Now is the time, and we will risk everything."

 ORS.261.t:0 "An Offer is Made..."
 ORS.261.d:0 "A man can be pushed, and pushed, but he can only be pushed so far. Many of the Russians in the brigade came willingly to Dirlewanger's banner, seeking an escape from their poverty stricken lives badly enough they were willing to deal with the devil to do so. Already we have enacted terrible raids against Russian communities, done unspeakable things, to say nothing of Dirlewanger's actions during the war. But now we hear he has plans for unprecedented attacks against the Ural League and Orenburg, and the Russians have finally reached their breaking point.\n\nWe don't know how they learned, but they have come to us and informed us they wish to join our plot to murder Dirlewanger. The only condition of their loyalty is that we also kill every single German son of a bitch around..."
 ORS.261.a:0 "...and of course we accept!"

 ORS.262.t:0 "Approaching the Taken..."
 ORS.262.d:0 "Before the Brigade reached Orsk, we went through territory now calling itself 'Nowa Polska', a most curious place filled with ethnic Kazakhs and Poles aplenty. The result was a number of raids that pressed many refugees into our service almost always against their will. These people know just as well as the Russians the atrocities Dirlewanger and his Germans have enacted against innocent people.\n\nWhilst he was on patrol, our plotters met with the leader of the Polish-Kazakh faction within the Brigade and asked them to join us. The man agreed on the spot, and we spent the rest of the patrol through the woodland discussing what part they would play in the scheme. In return, besides the sheer pleasure of having Dirlewanger dead, we have promised that they will be allowed to return to Nowa Polska freely after the deed is done."
 ORS.262.a:0 "The past will come for Dirlewanger, and it will strike hard."

 ORS.263.t:0 "To the Highest Bidder..."
 ORS.263.d:0 "We have secured the support of the two largest non-German factions within the Brigade, but there is another group who might interfere with our plans if we do not bring them over to our side. A number of mercenary groups of all kinds have been brought into the service of Dirlewanger, drawn in by the promises of plentiful plunder, bloodshed and women. Yet these men were bought, they care nothing for Dirlewanger himself. We know, in fact, some actively dislike him. These people sell themselves to the highest bidder, and all we need to do is put in that higher bid.\n\nWe have held secret meetings with the most powerful of these mercenary leaders. As we suspected, they can be convinced to accept a better offer from us and abandon Dirlewanger, but it will not be cheap. After many nights of negotiations, we have come to two deals they would be willing to accept. Either we grant them significant manpower from our faction, to make up for the recruits they would take in Dirlewanger's conquests, or we promise them almost the entirety of Dirlewanger's plunder stores. It's a hard choice, but what will we agree to?"
 ORS.263.a:0 "Give them their men."
 ORS.263.b:0 "They can take their riches, then be gone."

 ORS.264.t:0 "Their Last Meal..."
 ORS.264.d:0 "We have instilled chaos amongst the Germans within our ranks, exactly as we planned. With the Russians, Kazakhs, Poles and the mercenaries committed to our plot it was a simple matter. The Germans simply consider themselves above us, above the most basic and 'dirty' of tasks. As a result, it is from the ranks of our plotters that the food preparation staff are drawn. From there, it was a simple matter to poison the meals of as many Germans as possible one evening.\n\nBy the end of the night it had been announced that some kind of epidemic had been rapidly spreading through the camp with a large number of casualties, including the entirety of Dirlewanger's elite guards. There are a number of theories spreading about what had happened, with the two dominant theories being either the Ural Guard managed to tamper with our supplies or Lysenko had unleashed a new weapon upon us.\n\nBy the time the truth is fully understood, there will be almost no-one alive who cares it was us."
 ORS.264.a:0 "Water water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."

 ORS.265.t:0 "The Assassination of Oskar Dirlewanger."
 ORS.265.d:0 "It had snowed heavily during the night, leaving a crisp morning as Dirlewanger had walked from the latrine back towards his tent. The first blade came as if from nowhere, cutting deep into his side. Then another blade came for him, and another, and then another. One by one they came, and by the time it was over Dirlewanger had been stabbed over two dozen times. Collapsing to the ground, mortally wounded, he could not speak. With the last of his strength all he could do was bring his fur lined cloak to cover his face, hiding his gaze from his betrayers.\n\nBy midday most of the band had left, packing up what supplies they could and heading off in all directions to either form their own bands or go on to their next adventure. All that remained were the empty tents waving in the wind, the embers of the fires and Dirlewanger's lifeless body, left openly in the snow."

 ORS.266.t:0 "Deep in the West"
 ORS.266.d:0 "Our commanders have been arguing for weeks on how best to strike against Orenburg this time around, but none of the presented plans have felt right to Dirlewanger. We want to show those foolish peasants what true freedom is, and so the solution was rather simple Dirlewanger has realised.\n\nWe will send a large force of our boys deep into their territory and then simply...let them loose. We will let them go forth and do whatever it is they feel like doing, consequence free, for an entire week. The only requirements are that they report back to camp once the time has expired, they don't kill any of their officers, and they cause as much trouble as possible."

Not all of our men have returned, some having been lost to clashes with the Orenburg populace, or killed by our own men over disagreements they were finally free to resolve. But among those who have returned, morale has never been higher.\n\nOur officers are reporting that we had been actually underestimating the cruelty our boys were capable of, and when given a week free of consequence let their true colors shine.\n\nVillages have been burned, cattle slaughtered, old men fed to dogs, crop fields destroyed, wells poisoned, countless lynched, riches looted, alcohol abused, and women tortured so badly no-one in the band can claim to be innocent of sodomy anymore. Those are only a small portion of what they managed to inflicted to boot.\n\nThey have brought back riches and slaves aplenty, along with shining smiles that warm Dirlewanger's old heart in these cold lands."

 ORS.268.d:0 "The show these bastards are putting on is getting real old, real fast. 'The Saviors of the Urals' the people call them, the last line of defense between life and, well, us. We have launched countless raids into their territory over the years with mixed success, but this time we will beat them one step back towards their grave. Rather than another regular skirmish, we shall mobilize a full scale raid!\n\nWe shall launch simultaneous strikes against three locations within League territory:\n\nAn old Soviet airstrip turned ammunition depot, an old sports stadium which has been converted into a refugee camp and finally an Ural Guard field command post.\n\nAlongside these strikes, two dozen smaller raids will be launched along the border to keep the Guard distracted from our main targets."

 ORS.269.d:0 "We came, we saw, we set their world on fire! Our great raid against the Ural League has been a success on all fronts, the Guard left reeling from our attacks.\n\nAt the airstrip, our forces assaulted the base fiercely in close combat, savagely overwhelming the ill prepared garrison with knives, glass, and knuckles just as often as bullets. As the blood saturated the soil, we filled out trucks with as much as they could carry before detonating what remained of the ammunition depot, along with the fuel stocks, and destroyed the runway. We didn't find any planes there, but better to be safe than sorry.\n\nOver at the sports stadium, our boys struck in the night. Blocking the exits, they proceeded to throw petrol bombs into the refugee camp inside. The fires spread rapidly across the tents, screams engulfing the nights silence. Anyone lucky enough to manage to climb over the walls were promptly shot as a reward.\n\nFinally, part of our Waffen-SS unit specializing in stealth assaulted an Ural Guard command post. Dozens were killed in their beds, throats slit, along with the assassination of three senior officers. All radio equipment was wrecked and any documents of interest taken, including a couple of maps which will surely prove useful in future attacks.\n\nThe three attacks combined with the smaller distraction raids across the border have caused widespread confusion and terror, along with seriously crippling the Ural Guard for a few weeks at least."

We are here because we are the toughest, ballsiest sons of bitches around and it's high time we remind everyone else!\n\nDirlewanger has authorized simultaneous raids against Orenburg and the Ural League both, splitting our forces in two. It will be difficult, launching these attacks not throwing our full force into either, but the rewards we might take will be glorious.\n\nIn Orenburg we will send half of our boys deep into their territory and then simply...let them loose. We will let them go forth and do whatever it is they feel like doing, consequence free, for three days. The only requirements are that they report back to camp once the time has expired, they don't kill any of their officers, and they cause as much trouble as possible.\n\nThe other half of our forces will be sent across the border with the League and launch three simultaneous strikes against one of their ammunition depots in an old Soviet airfield, a refugee camp based out of an old sports stadium and an Ural Guard command post.\n\nNeither raid will have reinforcements, so it will be do or die. The perfect chance for our boys to prove themselves."

 ORS.275.d:0 "It has been a couple of months since our last exchange with our favorite freak Lysenko. Now following our recent great raid we have fresh captives that he will no doubt be excited to get his hands on. Whilst there are still voices within the band who argue that we should be taking more and more reward with each captive handed over, Dirlewanger has chosen to ignore them. We have more immediate fights against the Ural League and Orenburg approaching, it is not worth antagonizing Black Mountain just yet. As per the deal, we have sent our captives over to the scientists and have received our equipment in return."
 ORS.275.a:0 "A good deal all round."

 ORS.276.t:0 "Abandon the Nazi Salute?"
 ORS.276.d:0 "It has been a long time now since we gloriously served the Führer, but some ways of our former lives have still remained in place. One of these has been the Nazi salute, often accompanied with the phrase "Sieg Heil". Of course, ever since we were betrayed by our country, we have no Nazi Party; the gesture has instead migrated over as a mark of respect and loyalty to Dirlewanger, particularly among the Germans in our band.\n\nWith growing numbers of non-Germans in the Brigade, and the fact that we no longer serve the Reich, a number of our boys are questioning why we are still doing this gesture at all. Should we continue to promote its use or let it fall away?"
 ORS.276.a:0 "The salute is more than a mere gesture, we shall keep it."
 ORS.276.b:0 "We are forging our own destiny without Germany, abandon the salute."

 ORS.277.t:0 "The Oldest Of Us Has Died"
 ORS.277.d:0 "We have few ties to our homeland, back when we were a mere SS Division. Aside from some uniforms, flags and general memorabilia the largest of these connections are the original German members of the Brigade who have always held a special place for Dirlewanger. Yet our oldest member, Karl Wilhelm Müller, has died at the age of 73. Suffering from ailing health for the last few years, he suffered a stroke in camp two days ago which proved to be the last that he could take, finally passing away this morning.\n\nThe loss is being felt hard by the other members of the 'old guard' in the band, but importantly is beginning to raise questions about what exactly will happen if old age becomes brave enough to come after Dirlewanger."
 ORS.277.a:0 "Rest in peace, old friend."

 ORS.278.t:0 "Tensions within the Band"
 ORS.278.d:0 "Our band of merry maniacs is many things, but unified is far from one of them. Within our ranks are Germans, Austrians, Poles, Kazakhs, Russians, Ukrainians and among them criminals, political prisoners, sadists, rejects, concentration camp prisoners and lunatics. That is only a fraction of our composition these days to boot. As it turns out, all these different groups have difficulties getting along and a number of factions exist within the Brigade.\n\nWe have been aware of these tensions for some time due to the issues they have sometimes caused in the field with the following of orders, but this seems to have boiled over last night. After one too many drinks two of these factions came to blows, a massive brawl erupting in the middle of the camp as other groups got involved as well.\n\nCurious as to how it would play out, survival of the fittest and all, Dirlewanger allowed it to continue to its natural conclusion without his interference. By morning, eight were dead and twenty three more injured.\n\nThe surviving lead instigators have been executed for their roles in the brawl, and for now peace has returned. But this has once again raised the question of what exactly will happen one day when Dirlewanger dies and the unifying force of the band is gone."

 ORS.279.t:0 "Downed Luftwaffe Pilot Captured!"
 ORS.279.d:0 "Yesterday the band was thrown into disarray when a large snowstorm flared up seemingly out of nowhere, and moved straight through the camp. This morning we assessed the damage, with our equipment being the main thing affected along with scattered tents and minor injuries.\n\nYet with a clearer view of our surroundings, we have discovered something infinitely more interesting. Searching after some of the scattered equipment our boys discovered a downed Luftwaffe fighter along with its pilot, injured but alive. It would seem that the pilot had been on a terror bombing mission over Orsk when the snowstorm forced him to crash.\n\nInterrogating and torturing him thoroughly, we have learned a number of things about our former homeland. It seems Hitler is still Führer but Germany faces increasing unrest from within, and that there has been a great split between the Reich and the SS. Each word ripped open our old wounds, and the pilot has been hung from the nearest tree."
 ORS.279.a:0 "We'll make them all pay, one day..."

 ORS.280.t:0 "Fire in Orsk!"
 ORS.280.d:0 "Whilst our band moves around a lot to raid, our main base remains in the captured city of Orsk which we return to as needed. However we care far more about loot, slaves and bloodshed than we do about actually running some miserable city and so it largely lacks any form of administration.\n\nIt turns out this is not always to our benefit however, and the lack of oversight as well as the general piss-poor state of Orsk's infrastructure has resulted in a fire. We are not sure how it started, but a number of buildings and lives have been lost to the blaze.\n\nThankfully the majority of our spoils and slaves have been left intact, but the fires did ravage a section of the factory district, impacting what little industry we have."
 ORS.280.a:0 "We'll just have to do some more looting then!"

 ORS.281.t:0 "Cholera Outbreak!"
 ORS.281.d:0 "Life in the Urals is one of extremes for our merry band. We drink alcohol excessively, yet finding clean water is a rarity outside of winter. We feast on the spoils of our raids, yet face rotten and poorly cooked meals in leaner times. Often on the move, our sanitation situation is a complete monstrosity. Combined with how often we deal with the dead, the risk of disease is significant.\n\nUnfortunately one such situation has developed, with one of our few doctors reporting Cholera has broken out in camp. Over sixty men are infected, many seriously with twelve casualties so far. Among our prisoners and slaves scores are infected due to their particularly bad living conditions.\n\nWith the scarcity of medical supplies out here, the numbers are expected to rise and get worse before it gets better. There is little we can do but wait out the outbreak, bury our dead and move on."
 ORS.281.a:0 "Our boys deserved to die raiding, not like this."

 ORS.282.t:0 "The Most Dangerous Game"
 ORS.282.d:0 "Morale has been going steady lately, but it can always been improved and so Dirlewanger has arranged for a contest to be held within the Brigade. All members are welcome to participate, but all who wish to partake are required to pay an entry fee of a certain percentage of their spoil stashes. The winner will then take all of the spoils put into the pot, along with receiving a gift from Dirlewanger himself.\n\nThe game is simple: At dawn a number of our slaves and prisoners will be set free and unknown to them given a three hour head start. Then the contestants are set loose and the aim of the game is to return after twelve hours with as many heads as possible, the man with the most heads wins.\n\nThe competition has been a great success, even if more heads did come back than we actually sent out."
 ORS.282.a:0 "We should do this more often!"

 ORS.283.d:0 "'String him up!'\n\n'Kill the bastard!'\n\n'Cut off his cock and shove it down his throat!'\n\nThese were the cries echoing through the camp as the beaten and bloodied form of our 'guest' was dragged through the mud to the center of camp. We discovered him scurrying through our supplies like the rat that he is, and following a thorough session of torture it was discovered that the man is in fact a spy for the Ural League.\n\nIt's almost a compliment that they find the notion of fighting us daunting enough they want to gage our strength and supplies with subterfuge. We do like it when people pay us the proper respect after all, but this is a step too far.\n\nBrought before all to see, the spy was tied to a pyre and set alight, his screams matched only by the howls of the wolves. We'll dump the body at the border and let it serve as a message.\n\nIf they want to judge our strength, they can do it whilst we're killing them."
 ORS.283.a:0 "I spy, with my little eye..."

 ORS.284.t:0 "Is There a Doctor in the House?"
 ORS.284.d:0 "Today has been a bountiful day indeed. Whilst scouting out the lands of Orsk for any targets we might raid between larger raids on our enemies, we have discovered an operational hospital which had managed to escape our notice.\n\nUntil today, that is.\n\nHearing the report, Dirlewanger immediately ordered the raid and our boys descended. We faced only minor resistance from a civilian force, which we overwhelmed with ease, then went after the spoils. In a part of the world where medicine is difficult to come by, the medical supplies we have captured are worth their weight in gold and then some. Combined with the beautiful nurses we found and the few doctors we have pressed into service this had been a great day for the band. Any patients we found in the hospital have been executed and the building itself set ablaze."
 ORS.284.a:0 "They will serve us, or they will die."

 ORS.285.t:0 "An Excellent Hunting Scene"
 ORS.285.d:0 "There is only so much that can be raided, and as our band has grown so too has our demand for the most basic of goods. The need for meat but more importantly furs to protect us against the bitter winters here led to the formation of hunters within our ranks, responsible for doing just that whilst the rest of us raid, recover and raid some more.\n\nListening to the reports, it appears that we have had a particularly good hunting season this year. A large number of wolf, bear and elk furs have been secured for our stores and will be distributed among those most deserving of Dirlewanger's favor within the band.\n\nA little competition never hurt anybody, and the rewards make themselves clear in times like these."
 ORS.285.a:0 "Out here, a good fur is the difference between life and death."

 ORS.286.t:0 "Winter Attrition."
 ORS.286.d:0 "Prepare as we have, the Russian winters are perhaps our match in terms of their cruelty. So often even the strongest and bravest of men can do nothing against the bitter cold and harsh landscape.\n\nWhilst we Germans are undoubtedly superior to these Russians, we are not invulnerable nor immune to these temperatures. So far the cold has claimed the lives of twenty-seven of our men, usually slipping away from us during the night.\n\nIt is sobering to face our vulnerability and insignificance against these bitter feats of nature, yet we know that once we are through it it will be proof yet again of why we are the toughest, meanest sons of bitches these lands have ever seen!"

Buried within the snow and ice we have discovered a small detachment of T-26 tanks and the frozen skeletal remains of a number of Soviet soldiers. We suspect they must have been on their way to the front during the German invasion of the Soviet Union all those years ago, only to be claimed by the freezing temperatures before they could arrive.\n\nIt is a beautiful though haunting sight, a reminder of who we once were and how far we have come since.

His men have already begun chasing what few survivors remain, but the road to the Ural's riches remain closed for him. His men were too slow, and Lysenko has already taken most of the mountain for himself, ignoring Dirlewanger's demands for his rightful pillage.\n\nEvery gun piled in front of him, every small piece of jewelry and scant scrap of loot only drives his anger further. How dare that bitch of a scientist shun him like this? How dare him!? HOW DARE HE!?\n\nThere will be righteous revenge in time. For now, Dirlewanger looks to Orenburg. After that, who can say?"

We know in our hearts that no-one, no-one, else could have done this but us. All of our efforts have led us here, to this moment, to this great conquest.\n\nThe madman Lysenko was once our ally, and a valuable one at that. But he has finally reached the end of his usefulness to us now that the Ural League is destroyed and Orenburg thoroughly pillaged. Black Mountain is home to technological and scientific marvels that baffle the mind, that belong in novels rather than reality.

Whilst not the force it once was, when combined with the fences, tall walls, minefields and gun nests defending the mountain base, it was not an easy fight. Yet as soon as we pushed into the laboratories, how quickly our boys longed to fight soldiers again.\n\nWe had no idea of the extent of Lysenko's experiments, and our people encountered trap after trap as we attempted to secure the interior. Electric traps which boiled their blood, concussive waves which blew out their eyeballs, poison gas melting their lungs, legions of crazed experiments charging with filthy knives and brute force. The survivors will never forget the horrors of those laboratories, but finally we secured Black Mountain for ourselves. We have captured numerous fascinating pieces of equipment and revolutionary research, along with many of Lysenko's scientists working on the Mountain.\n\nYet captured soldiers are telling us Lysenko became obsessed with not allowing his work to fall into 'uneducated barbaric' hands, and so detonated explosives in many of his deeper labs holding his most prized experiments.

The soldier has made the audacious claim that he is not being provided with enough for all that he does for the raids, and that those who plunder the most should henceforth receive the most. He continues on to claim that the officer refuses to provide the men their fair share, and brazenly states that the officer's own contributions pale in comparison to his, something not represented in the rewards.\n\nNot willing to let his arguments be dismissed, the soldier produces a small sack of 'evidence'. The bag of evidence produced a foul smell that, upon opening, was revealed to be quite a brutal bounty. Inside laid at least a dozen pairs of strung together ears, ones that the soldier claimed to have removed from his victims during the raiding. The soldier continued to rant about how this was proof enough that he deserved far more loot than he was given, and that he demanded rewards to match his far superior contributions to the cause. All eyes were on Dirlewanger to set the precedent for the future."

More than a few in the camp believed this to be the final moments of the officer, as Dirlewanger went on a tirade against him. The officer was insulted in various ways, ranging from being a 'fucking moron' to being 'up for castration and demotion into a human shield'. The smack and storm flowing out of Dirlewanger's mouth was truly a sight to behold for those that were present, as the verbal annihilation of the man went on for a considerable length of time. Dirlewanger was, to say the least, displeased that the officer caused a stir that could disrupt the stability of the Brigade. It is unknown if Dirlewanger hadn't intended to kill the man at all, or if he felt a rare pang of mercy in his heart, but the officer walked away from the incident with nothing more than a fear of being castrated and a constant feeling of imminent execution by Dirlewanger's own hands. Perhaps a stern reprimand was all the man needed."

The triad of officers believe that it was unfair to demote the last offender, instead stating that Dirlewanger should've wrapped up his punitive action with the execution of the bravado filled soldier that was the true culprit for this whole mess. Not necessarily advocating for promoting that officer back to his former position, the three officers instead ask for an assurance of job security in the face of so called minor blunders that they may find themselves wrapped up in. Once again, a request to Dirlewanger leaves him in a position to set further precedent for how the Brigade should act towards the mistakes and inadequacies from those in charge. The officers gulp and shift uneasily, silently praying to themselves that Dirlewanger doesn't sign their death warrant right then and there. Dirlewanger is left to decide."

With a bit more freedom in their actions, and a lot less fear of being put down and shuffled out, the officers have begun to breathe easier. With this newfound lightening of the weight on their shoulders, a general increase of morale has spread from the officers themselves to the soldiers under their command, something appreciated throughout the entire camp as everyone seems to have an extra spring in their step on their way to plunder yet another fearful town of innocent Russians. Perhaps ruling entirely through fear can only take you so far, the officers are left to think, and perhaps the occasional benefit or ounce of freedom is beneficial for the overall effectiveness of your force. In any case, with morale up and attitude improved, the officers can command a bit more effectively as they carve a bloody, rich path across the Southern Urals and beyond."

As another three officers lie dead for dissenting from Dirlewanger's will, hasty replacements were set up to fill their now empty positions. One of these new officers, a former raider with no command experience and only a decent record of slaughter to his name, has caused yet more problems amongst the soldiers. When this new officer sought to flex his new position by taking command of the raid of a small village, he was utterly embarrassed. Reports state that this young officer's orders featured such tactically sound commands as "Charge!", and "Kill everyone!". Of course, when the villagers proved to be more than living scarecrows, his command faltered shamefully.\n\nNow, the men once again complain to Dirlewanger. The constant rotation of execution over the slightest objections, dissensions, and mistakes has caused a severe lack in command prowess among the Brigade. Now that complaints are in such numbers that they can't be solved with a few bullets, Dirlewanger seems to have backed himself into a wall and has unfortunately damaged the strength of his own army. For now, only time will tell if this will end up seriously hindering the efforts of the Brigade's raids, or even the coming war effort against the Ural League. In the meantime, it seems another officer will have to be shot."

 ORS.310.d:0 "After the execution of the bold soldier who caused a ruckus amongst the Brigade, a decision was made to posthumously look into his 'evidence' to see if his words had any merit, even after death. The subsequent investigation into these matters revealed a highly disturbing trend that did not simply die with the man, but one that has infected many of those that sat in the man's division. Within the battalion of the now dead soldier now lies a disturbing, perhaps even communist sentiment.\n\nWhile that man yet lived, his ideas of spreading the plunder more equally permeated many of the soldiers he fought alongside, and investigative action has revealed the communist, despicable, bolshevik, downright opposite to moral ideas that maybe the soldiers should receive a greater share of what they manually loot and steal for themselves.\n\nOf course, this trend is downright alarming, if not completely sinister in nature. Alas, with the circumstances, one is led to wonder why the officers of this battalion did not find it prudent to clamp down on such ideas, especially with the relative ease of which these red Russian ideas were discovered. Two courses of action seem equally appropriate in response; of course, the simple solution would be to remove this radical Marxist thought with the cracks of a rifle, but that could be viewed as a waste of manpower and ammunition. It may be equally advisable to find out why exactly the officers have not already taken care of this, and perhaps find the source of the problem."

 ORS.311.t:0 "A Streak of Red"
 ORS.311.d:0 "The decision to interrogate the officers of the newly discovered 'Bolshevik Battalion' proved to be wise, if only because it produced a harrowing discovery. When the officers were isolated and asked about the disconcerting ideas of their men, the officers eventually let it slip that even they somewhat take the ideas of their men into account. Even worse, the officers claim that such ideas are not isolated to a single battalion of the Dirlewanger Brigade, but are in fact quite common amongst Dirlewanger's entire army! The officers go so far as to claim that it is only the top echelons, Dirlewanger and his closest generals, that believe that the officers should be taking most of the spoils for themselves.\n\nConfronted with such radical, absurd ideas, Dirlewanger is left to wonder if this is all an audacious ploy to make these dissident ideas seem far more spread than they really are, or if this is a real problem that has found itself slithering around the minds of what used to be such brutal, compliant pillagers. After all, such a bluff could be a Bolshevik plot to force Dirlewanger to accept such ideas, when they do not have precedent in reality. On the other hand, the traitor officers could unfortunately be correct, which may place the entire future of the Dirlewanger Brigade in jeopardy! If the Dirlewanger Brigade is to continue its existence, a decision will have to be made to prevent the extremist ideas of loot sharing from spreading. Dirlewanger is left to make a decision on their next move, of course, after splattering these officer's heads on the ground."

While fortunate, the officers did end up wasting significant time and energy searching, interrogating, and shooting our way into the minds of our own men to discover the truth behind these matters. In any case, the Brigade can be sure that the truly evil ideas of sharing amongst ourselves has been stamped out once and for all amongst the men. The fate of the extreme leftist battalion is one of mercy, as to conserve manpower, they have all been forced at gunpoint to renounce their beliefs or be turned into a sludge of grey matter. Of course, the battalion is now no threat to us, their leadership replaced with a stern loyalist and their cursed beliefs humiliated in front of all of them. The Dirlewanger Brigade is thankfully free of the influence spread by the degenerate former Soviet land, and Dirlewanger is most pleased that their efforts to slaughter and plunder all in their path can proceed fresh and unimpeded."

 ORS.313.t:0 "A Red and Black Brigade"
 ORS.313.d:0 "Once again it was wise to look deeper into the post-mortem characteristics of our men. To our detriment, it seems that the officers did not lie at all about the presence of foul Communists in our ranks, and their extent has reached a point where Dirlewanger and his loyal generals can not simply gun down every single transgressor without mercy. It is a common, dreadful sentiment amongst a majority of our men that loot should be shared to the individual achievement of the raiders, and that sentiment is a firm belief in the hearts of our men. The shock and rage present in Dirlewanger is palpable, and the only thing stopping him from going on a killing spree is the necessity of manpower for his grand plans to loot and plunder every single square inch of the Southern Urals and beyond.\n\nLamentably, this means that Dirlewanger is faced with two options to continue the further existence of his brigade. Of course, he can step away from the investigation, and pretend that he never found out about such contemptible ideas present in his men. Then, there is the second option; a step into the darkness that seems to have fallen over all of his men. Perhaps stability would be easiest found if Dirlewanger took some of their ideas in account. While utterly vile, it would be likely to produce an increase of morale in the men, something that may improve effectiveness for our great conquest. It is simply deplorable that the men have found idiotic minds of their own, but yet Dirlewanger stands, forced to take into account the wishes of his band of executioners."

Any pang of mercy that appeared to be present during their last confrontation was visible no longer, as Dirlewanger ordered for a few raiders to guide the officer to the middle of the Brigade's camp, ensuring the maximum visibility for whatever he had planned. As the officer was dragged along to his destination, Dirlewanger made sure to lay into the officer once again, ridiculing him all the way to his stop. The officer's life was officially turned into an example for all of those who, intentionally or not, cause issues for the stability and function of the Brigade's existence. Any questions about what would happen to the officer were answered, as the sharp crack of rifles sent bullets into his skull, ending his life for the viewing pleasure of all present."

 ORS.315.d:0 "Though his life was a near constant haze of devilish excitement and all manner of debauchery, for once Dirlewanger had found a moment of relative quiet, alone in his tent. With little to do, his eyes scanned the space for something to occupy himself, when his gaze fell upon his trusty rifle.\n\nIt was an ancient thing, really. A standard issue Karabiner 98k, one he had owned since his days still on the Reich's leash. Yet despite his men continually acquiring new weapons in their bloody raids, he had kept it and maintained his rifle all these years, and continued to use it to deadly effect. Sitting down with it on the dirty fur mats he used for a bed, he began carefully polishing the grime off of its worn surface.\n\nAs he worked, his mind wandered backwards in time. He traced the rusty trigger, and remembered how his finger had click, click, clicked it in the faces of Speidel's traitorous men, blowing their empty skulls open across the Russian snow. He polished the barrel, and smirked as he thought back to when his men had first arrived in Orsk, when he thrust it down the throat of the last mayor of the city and almost choked him to death before shredding his innards with a bullet. His fingers rubbed over the scratches on the stock, and he laughed at all the Russian peasants he had simply beaten to bloody pulp with it.\n\nHe held the now relatively clean weapon in front of him. To him, beholding this rifle was like looking in a mirror. It had been with him for as long as he remembered. It was why he kept it with him all this time.\n\nIt was a part of him."

 ORS.316.d:0 "As the raiding party set down to rest in the burned ruins of the latest village to face their wrath, Dirlewanger hopped out of his truck and went to get something from the back. As he approached, he noticed that the mud from the recent rains now caked the side of the vehicle. He looked around the village for some useless sot to foist the responsibility of cleaning the vehicle upon, when he found a group of his men roasting the village animals over a fire.\n\nHis gaze honed in on one particular man who had most displeased him. A Khazakh raider, one who had joined the band recently but had constantly hung back in the raids, keeping himself out of danger yet still happily helping himself to the loot afterwards. Dirlewanger calmly ordered the man to approach. He smiled and offered him a cloth and a bucket, and ordered him to have his truck spotless within the hour.\n\nThe coward's face immediately went white, and Dirlewanger's smile grew all the wider. A few of the other men present began to cackle at the poor man, who immediately set to furiously scrubbing the mud off of the weather-beaten metal. Dirlewanger chuckled and wandered off into the village to find loot or some captives to entertain himself with, leaving the man to work like his life depended upon it."

The sides were now completely free of mud, the dust had been polished off the windscreen, and even the interior had been cleared of grime. Dirlewanger checked it all over, once, twice, three times. Finally he approached the man and thanked him for making his truck cleaner than it had been in a long time.\n\n"Of course, I said I wanted it spotless..." he said, that insidious grin returning to his face. The blood left the raider's face once more as Dirlewanger knelt down and beckoned him to come and look. There, just on the underside of the front left fender, was a tiny leftover spot of mud.\n\nA single sob was all that had time to leave the man's throat before Dirlewanger put his rifle to the back of his head and pulled the trigger. The other men watching laughed as two approached to dump the raider's body with the others. After watching the wretch's corpse go, Dirlewanger turned back to his vehicle, only to groan with frustration at the sight of all the blood now splattered over the door. He turned to the man who had spilled booze over him the other day and barked at him to get the mess cleaned up.\n\nThe same rules applied, as always."

 ORS.318.d:0 "Dirlewanger was deep in his cups when he was interrupted by some of his men barging into his tent. Before he could demand an explanation, they dragged forwards a bloodied, tired and emaciated boy no more than fifteen years old. He had been caught at the edge of the camp where the men had beat him up, until he surprised them all by crying out in fluent German.\n\nThe boy feebly pleaded with Dirlewanger, introducing himself as Otto Wagner. He claimed to be the son of a settler family in Reichskommissariat Moskowien, where he had been a petty thug. He and a group of fellow criminals had fled east after being caught filching weapons from the local garrison, but the wastes and the hostile locals of the lands beyond German control had not been kind to them. He was all that remained of that party, and he had eventually found his way to Orsk after overhearing a group of militiamen talking about a group of German bandits based there.\n\nWhether out of genuine curiosity or simply thanks to being too drunk to care, Dirlewanger decided not to spill the boy's guts to the dirt. Remarking that he must be fine Aryan stock to have made it this far on his own, Dirlewanger told the boy that he could stay within the camp. However, he grabbed the boy close and threatened him never to disrespect his new master.\n\nOtto quickly wiped his tears and quietly thanked Dirlewanger and bid a hasty exit from the tent."

He does not complain or talk much, even as the older men roughhouse him around and give him the occasional beating. After all, he does not have anywhere else to be, so for the most part he puts up with getting the scraps from the table and generally being the runt of the Brigade.\n\nRecently, Dirlewanger has become tired of managing the day-to-day humdrum of loot distribution and ammo management. He has decided he would much like a secretary, like the big bosses back in Germany would have, to handle all the boring tedious work while they could spend their time out cracking skulls. Perhaps seeking to finally give Otto some purpose, he unceremoniously dumped a pile of ledgers and notebooks in his hands and told him to get to work.\n\nNot daring to disrespect Dirlewanger, the new secretary quickly took to his duties. Satisfied that the boy was no longer sitting around uselessly, Dirlewanger looked for some more depraved activities to involve himself in now that his responsibilities had been delegated away."

 ORS.320.d:0 "Earlier this morning, a batch of captives destined for Lysenko's labs were brought into camp. The bandits herded them into a pen once used to hold cattle before the resident farmer was unceremoniously impaled on the gatepost. Though officially they were supposed to deliver all of those they captured unharmed to the madman on the mountain, the bandits never refrained from an opportunity to have their ways with defenseless innocents.\n\nAmidst the scenes of depravity and gratuitous violence, Dirlewanger's young secretary Otto approached the pen. He was long since desensitized to the Brigade's antics and watched the horror with a dead-eyed stare. It was then that he noticed a small glimmer from the fingers of one of the captives. Eager to prove himself to the bandits and to take some loot, Otto approached the man and ordered him to hand it over. To his surprise, the man refused. He desperately begged Otto to let him keep it, for it was his wedding ring and the only memory he had left of his wife.\n\nOtto punched him.\n\nAs the man collapsed to the floor, some of the bandits cheered him on and told the boy to hit him again. He stood there, contemplating, but the cheers were growing, so he gave the man his boot in the stomach. He bent over and gave the man another punch. Again, and again. The captive begged for mercy as Otto grew more and more furious, but still he refused to hand over his precious ring. Eventually the man lay cold and lifeless on the ground.\n\nFor a brief moment, the boy stared at the corpse in shock, then, he reached down and plucked the trinket from the dead man's finger and held it aloft for all to see.

One man lay dead, an ornate knife embedded in his neck, while the boy Otto Wagner lay upon the ground peppered with gunshots and a mangled arm.\n\nDirlewanger furiously demanded to know what had happened, to which one of the men gathered around the scene explained that the two had gotten into a fight over loot. Both had wanted the knife for themselves, and when the elder man refused to relent the boy had viciously attacked him. A struggle ensued in which the man brutally slashed Otto's arm before the boy pulled the blade from his own flesh and dealt the killing blow. Before he lost consciousness, however, the elder had been able to pull out his luger and shoot the boy several times, he had missed the chest, but his arms and shoulders caught bullets all over. The old man was shot immediately for hurting his secretary, and shouted loudly at the men around them complete useless for letting Otto get into trouble like this\n\nAfter Dirlewanger had calmed down, he turned his attention to Otto. The boy was truly in a sorry state. The boy's arms was beyond saving, and he was quickly bleeding out. He would certainly never be useful as a secretary again, though with the limited medical supplies available it was possible he could still be saved and made useful as a cook or something similar. But in such harsh climes and amongst such harsh men, the way to deal with a man no longer needed is often a quick and merciful death. and Dirlewanger eyed up his pistol and considered perhaps just putting the boy out of his misery."

They have little in ways of pure wealth, but they always have full cellars, plenty of vodka, and the occasional silver candlestick or gold ring to loot. All in all, the best pickings a raider could hope for without having to brave armed resistance.\n\nSuddenly, the squad comes to a halt at their leader's signal. He silently points to a shallow ravine, as the men gaze in awe. There, staring at them, is an adult brown bear in the middle of hunting for dinner. The men are frozen, desperately hoping not to break the uneasy silence between them and the beast. Finally, the commander leans over to his second-in-command and whispers "I'll go up to it."

After a brief debate, the guards decide to skin it and bring the pelt back to camp as their spoils-it's certainly a unique prize.\n\nOn the ride back to Orsk, the commander decides to have them stop at another ravine, hoping to give their horses a few minutes to recuperate and find some water. They do not notice a small cave around the bend, nor does the soldier guarding the horses notice three fully-grown brown bears lumbering toward them. However, he certainly notices when it bites down on his neck.\n\nWhen the squad does return to camp, it only consists of three horrified and blood-splattered soldiers riding on the backs of claw-raked horses. Neither the commander or his aide are seen, and none of them are willing to say what happened.

It turns out that Siegfried is not the fastest of mounts, but he can get up to a decent speed for a short amount of time and doesn't even flinch at the sound of gunfire. As the men ride out toward a village, hoping to return with plunder and glory, the other squads cheer with raucous laughter as they see Siegfried lumbering by, with plenty of jokes about the commanding having found himself a Russian woman circulating.\n\nAs the squad nears the village, they hear something that is exhilarating yet unnerving: the sound of gunshots fired by some village militia. While this raid will certainly be more dangerous than the usual ransacking of poor farmers' hovels, the presence of a militia means that they have loot worth defending. The commander spurs Siegfried forward, and the horses beside him accelerate from a trot to a gallop. As the squadron begins to open fire, Siegfried suddenly jolts to a stop and slumps to the ground. The commander scrambles off the beast's back to see what could be wrong. Fortunately, Siegfried is unharmed; it seems he just stumbled on a rock. While the commander is relieved, it does raise some concerns about Siegfried's combat efficiency-bears, after all, are neither as fast nor as agile as horses.

The bullets whiz all around, with the militiamen having retreated behind the windows and alleyways of their village. But the men of the Dirlewanger Brigade are experienced enough to successfully fight back against their enemies, and ride through the streets shooting everything that moves. At the front of the squadron is the commander, leading a roaring Siegfried and spreading chaos in the streets.\n\nFinally, the men prepare a charge against the last stronghold of local resistance: the village's tiny, ramshackle Orthodox church. Although most locals scatter at the sight of over a dozen bandits armed to the teeth galloping towards them, several remain determined to the last and fire off a few more rounds from the rifles before being shot or cut down. Most of those bullets fly by harmlessly-except for one. Having been shot in the head, Siegfried comes to a crashing halt, and the commander is thrown to the ground. He scrambles over to his dying mount, cradles Siegfried's bloodied head, and closes his dark eyes for the last time. The commander stands up, pulls out a pistol, and walks towards the cowering villagers taking refuge in the church with determination in his eyes.\n\nThis one's for Siegfried."

Local guards litter the streets and alleyways, their blood seeping into the dirt. Much of his subsequent duties focus on rounding up and executing military-age prisoners, looting winter food stocks, organizing the fair division of war booty among the men, and burning down the tiny Orthodox church where the town's defenders made their last stand. One of his men had lost a horse during the charge, but that was of little concern at the moment as the men were going house-to-house and grabbing whatever, or whoever, caught their eye. This town was a rather ripe reward; the commander himself had gotten a gold-plated pocket watch, a bottle of brandy, a new pistol, a silver Communion chalice from the church, and a few stacks of old Soviet rubles (having long lost their monetary value, but being wonderful firestarters).\n\nOnce the men had their fun, they began making their way back to camp. But as they near the spot where they left Siegfried, the bear was nowhere in sight. There's no blood or sign of a fight, but there are tracks leading off in the direction of the cave where they first found him. Siegfried was wild, after all, and it would be foolish to try and contain him for too long. With a heavy heart, the commander tells his men to ride onwards, knowing that it was probably the last any of them would see of Siegfried the cavalry bear."

 ORS.331.t:0 "A Brilliant Proposal"
 ORS.331.d1:0 "The great, brooding mind of Oskar Dirlewanger had borne a brilliant proposal surely beneficial to his elite retinue; removing the Sieg Heil. Dirlewanger was a man of action, ill-suited to the hamfisted social engineering of the Roman salute. This troop contingent after all was not ever going to be needed for flag waving or flattering superiors; here every man was his own master, master of creating a destiny and legacy for him and his men to follow. Fear as a form of control had always worked on those he had terrorised, so as a logical conclusion it should also work on his men if they rejected his idea.\n\nIn his delusion the crazed officer, who could have likely been a successful Landsknecht in a time both different and too similar to this one, had forgotten the reason his former masters had secured utter subservience from their underlings. The regimentation and drilling had created soldiers of iron wills, and even if they represented their ancestors who likewise pillaged Central Europe with horrifying fidelity, believing them to have the ability to murder and rape for the same reasons was utterly foolish.\n\nThe brilliant strategist had given his all-powerful decree; now he watched it fall into ruin. Every time he gathered his men around him now they stood straight to attention, arms raised at the infamous angle and roared the mantra, some even with smirks on their faces. The non-Germans began to join in, peer pressure blinding them to what they were doing and its meaning to their peoples. Even more worryingly, some of the more senior veterans of his brigade now began to almost take less notice of him, punishing violators of his supreme will with suspicious laxity. But he was still the indispensable commander that would lead his men to glory, so this was but a minor setback. Or was he? His aging mind was playing cruel tricks on him in his clear times before the mist of madness descended again."
 ORS.331.d2:0 "Dirlewanger was a veteran, having served in the Deutschvölkischen Schutz- and Trutzbund, then the SA and NSDAP, finally the SS. His desertion from the glorious Reich in its hour of need was not because of dismissal or hatred for the nation; his resentment of certain Wehrmacht staff would not change his love and yearning for his homeland. And so the decision to keep the tradition of the Sieg Heil, a unifier of Germans worldwide, was a simple one for him, despite having a large foreign presence in his army. When announcing the decision to his troops, he was disconcerted to find reluctance, apathy, even subtle opposition in his ranks. In an effort to uphold his iron authority over the brigade he raised his skinny arm and clicked his heels with the intensity of a much younger man.\n\n"SIEG HEIL!" he screamed, eyes bulging, a single vein on the edge of bursting near his grey hairline. To his dismay and seething anger a few men began to snigger, but most of those gathered around his makeshift platform continued to stare at him with something almost resembling curiosity. The tainted man, half-drowned in madness, had forgotten who he now led. The pure fanaticism had been transformed into bitter cynicism by the Russian wastes, diluting the SS brigade it had once been with men of opportunity and desperation. These were men neither of ideology nor religion; a grouping of nihilistic looters who lived from day to day had no motivation to uphold tradition that had abandoned or abused them mercilessly. Dirlewanger stepped of the podium in silence; punishment would have to follow. His quiet mutterings were lost in the din of his troops reverting back to what they had been previously doing before the former SS officer had given his address, something they were proudly good at, pillaging and raping the small, ruined Russian village."

 ORS.332.d1:0 "With every day in the chaotic Ural steppes of the former Soviet Union, what had once been an SS Brigade slipped further into simple brutality. Their morality eroded to cynical nihilism, one even Nietzsche would have raised his eyebrows at, no longer rooted to any ethical order but their own. Within this shift lay a twisted birth, the mother being the sadistic joy of hearing lost souls begging for mercy as they were raped and tortured, the father being the thrill of death knocking on one's door on a near-daily basis. The endless violence had implanted in the brigade the idea to reject Nazism, certainly a defiled, degenerate ideology, yet still with traditions that withheld certain desires and behaviors.\n\nDirlewanger, despite having deep and even affectionate ties to the twisted ideology that had brought Germany to the heights he had exploited, felt his and the roots of the former SS members of the brigade slowly being replanted into the fertile ground of the banditry of the non-German recruits. In an unsurprising move the alcoholic, sexual deviant of a commander, abolished, or rather forgot, the Sieg Heil, a greeting synonymous with conformity and strict discipline. He was not a man that required the groveling and intricate power play of the Führer, nor were these the times of a settled, organized existence; these were the times of pleasure filled pillage. These were the times of death and glory."
 ORS.332.d2:0 "Despite all the astounding, nihilistic carnage and pillage the rugged men of Dirlewanger's brigade had caused to the Urals, in their merciless hearts they remained loyal to the blood and soil they once fought for. A certain degree of respect, even admiration, was bred and maintained for the distant German Vaterland, thumping SS marches were drunkenly sung, and hardened veterans sometimes recounted sweet and bitter memories of their hometowns, often resulting in laughter and jeering that always just barely masks the universal longing of the exile. The Russian and other ethnic groups that had joined the wandering bandits were often savagely harassed by German SS troopers in their own ranks who had fallen into old routines, only to then be falsely accused and punished by their officers.\n\nYes, the old spectre of Nazism still clung to the hearts and minds of the former 36th Waffengrenadiere. It was difficult to peel off with the weight of traditions accrued to it like barnacles to a wreck, such as the Sieg Heil salute. Dirlewanger had briefly pondered whether it had outlived its functionality but had decided to keep it, to the silent chagrin of the non-German bandits and great elation of the 'aryans'. It would remain along with the now many other quite frankly defunct traditions as a staple of the brigades' identity."

It was during one of these passing periods that it came to him, he had the solution. Dirlewanger would authorize the creation of a truck grand and powerful on a level suited to him. Named after its inventor, the Oskarwagen would become a motorized arsenal of fear and firepower, with a cannon large enough to turn a farm into a forest of woodsplinters. When such divine inspiration hit Dirlewanger, he knew he had to act. Immediately, he ordered four of his burliest brutes to mount the largest gun in their stockpile atop his truck. Dirlewanger waited with eagerness to see the results of his illustrious idea; almost enough to turn his attention away from the execution of a few peasants on his latest raid."

It was a surprise to the men of the camp to find Dirlewanger excited about something that wasn't completely morally bankrupt, and most didn't quite know how to feel about it, but eventually the black band found themselves just as excited as nervous for the unveiling of the great Oskarwagen that had seen so much hype from their leader. Dirlewanger had mandated a few old and broken vehicles to be set up as a target for the gun, and it was with much tension that he personally ordered the firing of the cannon."

The only sound that was heard was Dirlewanger intense laughter, utterly amused at the flattening of the two men. That laughter slowly ground to a halt as Dirlewanger realized that his Oskarwagen was a failure.

The initial motivation, making Dirlewanger's personal vehicle special, was suddenly not so important anymore. New, glorious visions arrived as others faded, truck upon truck with cannons lining up like the old days, barraging helpless villages, and then being able to roll right in and meet no resistance. Squads of four men each, all willing and eager, wanting to pilot their own Oskarwagen into the living quarters of those hiding their valuables.\n\nIt dawned upon him that the Oskarwagen in all honestly was a tank, and that he was about be a tank commander, he lit up as he envisioned all the loot that his plan would bring him."

While such a census had been attempted two years before, it had resulted in completely useless data, the brigade's men seemingly too erratic to be tracked with mere numbers. Despite this previous failure, Dirlewanger doubled down when he was questioned by some brave souls, and with a low growl exclaimed "If you won't count them, then I'll shoot every last one of my men and count the corpses myself."\n\nThis level of urgency has never marked previous headcounts, and almost every bandit has his own personal speculation on why the count is being carried out. The leader himself wouldn't give any answer more solid than just calling it a hunch, which is not making the few soldiers with administrative skills any more confident about the necessity of all this. However, the one thing they fear more than dull bureaucratic work is the wrath of the bandit king, and while everyone might drag their feet, the headcount will nonetheless be carried out soon.

Upon being questioned by the search party, the perplexed leaders among them claimed it had just been a routine raid, but after the most basic of investigations it became obvious that they were trying to conceal what they had gained and not give the usual cut to Dirlewanger. Trying to cut a profit without including the bandit king. A grave mistake.\n\nThis obviously could not stand. Bruised and bloody they were dragged screaming all the way back to Dirlewanger himself, and not only were they forced to give up the entirety of their earnings, they were required to beg for mercy personally.

They had gained considerable spoils and captives in their cruel ransacking, a little celebrating until the search party turned up was therefore not entirely unreasonable. When they were ordered to return back to the brigade, no complaints were noted at first, however it soon became clear that they had intended to keep all their loot to themselves. This led to heated arguments on the way home and even a rather wasteful amount of bloodshed. Upon their return Dirlewanger was dutifully informed of their ill intentions, his fury barely containable. He demanded they turn over the proper share as usual. In an unusually brazen act of defiance, they refused right to his madness contorted face. The cracking mask of humanity finally peeled entirely to reveal a seething insanity as he ordered all of them to be executed as traitors and their loot turned over to him personally.

Their pitiful pleas for death granted by the unjudging crack of the bandit's guns. A few had avoided this disgustingly cruel fate and had been working for Lysenko as guards, but these lucky ones were definitely a minority. One soldier thought to check the men against the list of missing men from the headcount a while back, and sure enough these fifty were on there. They had finally been found, though it was too late for many. Those that were still alive were mostly allowed to re-join the brigade, and they told many a horror story of the experiments and madness of Lysenko. The ones who had become guards were declared traitors and taken as captives, lined up in neat rows with each second one shot. The spared ones, faces covered in snot and tears, had to drag a dead comrade each into the mountain cells they had guarded. Their fates will likely be unfortunate as all they will be able to feast upon are the bodies of their former friends. Examples have to be set to maintain an iron grip.

Some of these men had been missing for years, and the fact that they were found by complete and utter luck shows that it's likely that many of the men missing from the headcount simply deserted, and that a few might not ever be found.

He pulled them out from under a stack of extremely outdated bomb schematics to see what they were. It was a list of names, each one crossed out in either black or red ink. Dirlewanger smiled. It was the years-old list of people who had been missing from the headcount. He read through the pages, looking at each name, but his smile fell away from his face when he got to the third page. There were a few names that were not crossed out but rather circled. The lost that had never been discovered.

How dare they have run from him, and gotten away with it too! Oh, if only he could know their exact locations, find each of them, punish them personally...he fantasized about hangings, shootings, torture, screams for mercy.

As they pillaged every chamber, the substantial art collection it held was treated with utter indifference by the drunken raiders, smashing work after work with no restraint. But for a moment, the decimation ceased as they saw an elderly man standing in front of one painting, sobbing and pleading for its mercy. "Old bastard, what is this?" Dirlewanger barked in confusion.\n\nThe man collapsed onto his knees, begging for his father's magnum opus to be spared. The band looked upon the abstract, meaningless composition, their faces sneering with disgust. "It's just a fucking black square!" a brigadier howled, prompting voracious laughter. They readied their rifles and began to volley hundreds of rounds towards the man and the degenerate art, shredding its paint and tearing its linen. The rampage soon continued until they ended with a lit match.\n\nAs the mansion went up in flames, one of the soldiers saw something in the smoke. Something that appeared to distinguish itself powerfully from the rest, an apparition that contrasted with the sky so severely that it was impossible for a more perfect, more supreme polarity to ever be imagined.

Returning home with a mountain of loot and captives, Dirlewanger proclaimed that the night would see the greatest party in the history of Russia.\n\nThe vodka flowed freely and the loot was spread far and wide. Quickly the men of the Brigade became heavily inebriated, losing whatever remaining restraint they had left. As the sun set, the camp descended into a cacophony of wild celebration, senseless violence and unspeakable debauchery. The captives were brutalized even more than the normal fare for the band, and by morning few would remain alive and even fewer would be happy to be. The night soon devolved into a further haze of chaos as brawls broke out over the dwindling alcohol. For the first time in decades, the streets of Orsk were alive, albeit with the sound of jeers, screams and death.\n\nAs the overcast sky began to lighten with the dawn, the men of the Brigade awoke disheveled, hungover and surly. Blood, feces, and other fluids lay splattered throughout the streets, and the bodies of those killed by either the chaos of the night or by simple alcohol poisoning littered the ground here and there. Minimal effort was made to clean the place, and soon the bandits simply returned to their more cohesive roles of brutality, hoping to avoid incurring the wrath of Dirlewanger and his splitting headache."

Many of the firearms were in a sorry state, not used since the World War and intended only for hunting. Still, a gun was a gun, and even those with hunting rifles made no complaints. They just loaded their weapons and eyed their meager allocation of ammunition nervously. Their stockpile was small enough already, and they still had to make sure they saved one bullet in case of the worst.\n\nThe men looked grim as they took up their positions. Deep down, they all knew they would not live. This was, barring divine intervention, their final stand. Though they could not save themselves, they could still make time for their families. They would make sure their own deaths were the slowest possible as long as it meant they could aim another shot and pull the trigger again.\n\nIn the distance, the faintest hum of motors started to be heard.

The former crack SS troopers and ruthless Russian bandits were now a sorry after-image of their former fear and awe inspiring power, yet still retained their gruesome rejection of any normal moral standards. Not a single poor soul had been left alive after the bandit plague had washed over the small rural community in their search for a suitable place to face their downfall.\n\nSome of their number had deserted, others had been executed, now all that remained were the most determined and steadfast killers that the brigade could offer. Despite this, the men gathering in the strategically untouched village square began to have their first doubts over the outcome of tomorrow's battle. Their numbers had been thinned to an extent worse than at any other time during their rapacious rampage through the Russian plains.

On the contrary, many of them relished in their looting and raping of the Russian wastes. But there were other things they did to pass time, much to the relief of the surrounding villages.\n\nWhat started with a German soldier coming up with an idea for a new drinking game, and the Russian contingent supplying stolen vodka, became a great new tradition. It would be something repeated by the brigade for a long time to come, and in later years, unscrupulous American college fraternities. The true nature of the game will be lost to time, but future renditions will generally agree that a live pigeon, an ink quill, and an anthill are all involved.\n\nSoon after on that fateful first night, the "game" part of the celebration quickly ended, and dissolved into a wild, debaucherous party the likes of which had not been seen in years.

As the two bandits rolled around in the mud drunkenly screaming obscenities and threats at one another, they quickly became the spectacle for all their fellow soldiers that evening.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot cut through the night, bringing the revelry to a sudden halt. One of the fighters knelt on the ground, staring dumbfound at the Nagant revolver that had somehow made its way into his hands. His opponent was lying facedown, a trickle of blood running out of his mouth. The surviving fighter staggered upright and prodded his unfortunate rival with the toe of his boot, slurring "Vanya?

It was then that they saw him.\n\nIn the long grass about fifty meters away was one of those goody-two-shoes Ural Guards, watching the party and presumably counting their numbers to report back. Seeing that he had been spotted, the nameless soldier quickly but calmly sprung from his position and began to retreat over the ridge behind him. Udo, a man who was as supremely violent as he was mentally addled by years of substance abuse, roared with delight at the prospect of an easy kill and gave chase. Not wishing to be left out of the bloodsport, Jörg and the rest speedily followed.\n\nThe hunt was on.\n\nThe men were eager and their weapons were quickly drawn, but the soldier was surprisingly agile as he ducked and weaved amongst the rocks and trees. Numerous shots were fired but none of them managed to connect, prompting Ralf to stupidly attempt to throw his empty gun at their target - to no effect. Eventually, the chase led them to an abandoned Soviet military compound.\n\nGünter and Marc were almost able to seize their prey at the gatehouse, but with alarming dexterity the soldier sprang up and over the locked gate and soon had vanished into the mess of buildings."

Emerging into a small field alongside some old barracks, they soon realized that they were in a rather extensive compound. Their target could be anywhere, and if they were not careful he could simply slip past them and wander out the way they came. Ralf then had the idea to split up and fan out across the compound. The sooner they could locate him, the sooner they could all converge and beat the daylights out of him, after all.\n\nThe men agreed. Jörg, Marc and Ralf agreed to search the barracks, while Günter took Udo to investigate the admin building. When Ershat moved to follow them, Jörg shoved him back and had him guard the gate to make sure their quarry didn't get out that way. If he did try the gate again, they would easily be able to find him by the sound of the Kazakh's screams. Their roles assigned, the three groups split up to hunt for the nameless soldier.\n\nNot one of them noticed the soldier in shadow, peering down at them from the old watch tower. Through the narrow slit of his visor, he observed the groups diverging, noting their paths and memorizing the layout of the base from above. Planning the choke points.

He almost considered leaving them to their wild goose chase and running away. Nobody need know he had ever been associated with the bandits. He could head south, and take up residence with whoever controlled Kazakhstan these days.\n\nOf course, Ershat was a coward who clung to the Brigade because he would rather be with them than against them. So he did as he was told. As always.\n\nSuddenly, his attention was caught by the creaking of wood. Spinning to the source, he saw a dark figure quickly disappear into a small toolshed, the door falling shut behind it. At last, a chance to prove himself! Ershat charged to the shed, preparing to overpower the soldier and present his quarry to those haughty Germans. Busting through the door, he raised his sabre ready to strike, and -\n\nThe shed was empty. There were no windows, and aside from a few piles of old tools there was nowhere to hide. Ershat gazed in furious disbelief at the space, humiliated at his own foolishness and beginning to consider if the Germans had a point.\n\nIt was at that moment he had the strangest inclination to look up.\n\nThere, held up by all four limbs against the walls of the shed, was that infernal soldier, his masked face staring blankly down at him from above.

In this confined space, the unwashed bandit's stench was unbearable. He was nigh useless in the search, the brain-addled fool being more content to smash random bits of furniture. Günter half considered finally killing him and blaming it on the soldier, if Udo were not so freakishly and brutally strong that he might tear him in two.\n\nAs they searched the upper floor, Günter glanced out the window and scanned the camp. It was then he noticed Ershat was no longer at the gate. His foul mood deepened as he made a mental note to relieve the useless Kazakh of several teeth once they regrouped. It was then his ears caught the ever so subtle cracking and splintering of wood from the stairwell. His dash to investigate was interrupted, however, as he almost tripped over the knelt down form of Udo giggling over some leftover nude photographs.\n\nJust before he finally snapped and brained the idiot, his eyes darted to the stairwell and locked directly with the unknown soldier, staring at him with no visible emotion. The two bandits almost simultaneously darted for him, but they would never reach him. With a sudden snap the floor beneath them gave way, and the two plunged down to the first floor. The impact was so great, they broke through this floor as well, landing in a heap on the ground floor.\n\nGünter screamed out in pain, his arm and leg broken in multiple places. Udo lay spasming, a huge splinter of wood penetrating his brain. As Günter cried out for help, the soldier descended the stairs, tossing aside the saw he had used to weaken the boards. His gun out of reach, Günter could do nought but watch as the soldier forced the splinter deeper into Udo's skull with his foot before taking a shovel and smacking it repeatedly over Günter's head."

As he wondered curiously whether the showers still worked, the terrible sound of guttural screams and the distant thwack, thwack, thwack of a shovel echoed out from across the base.\n\nJörg and Marc raced off to investigate the sound, but Ralf felt satisfied that they could handle it. It was just one soldier, after all, what harm could he do versus the wolves of Germany? Entering the dank and musty shower quarters, he tried each shower in turn. Disappointment built as one by one each failed to produce its promised stream, until finally one of them miraculously had a small amount of water left in its tank. The trickle was meager and very cold, but for a bandit so dirtied with filth and the stain of his sins it was a refreshing relief.\n\nAs Ralf washed the water over his face and down his arms, he was blissfully unaware of the figure slowly creeping behind him. Too late did he catch sight of a shadow on the wall, cast by the light through the entry doorway. The shadow of a blade raised to strike. He spun around just in time for the blade to plunge into his chest. The ceaseless masked figure raised his blade and plunged it down again. And again. And again. Ralf screamed in agony, his feeble resistance growing weaker and weaker with each blow.\n\nAs he finally slumped down to the ground, life ebbing away, Ralf watched as the figure calmly turned from the macabre scene and walked out the door. As the last trickle of blood left his body the final dregs of water carried it all away down the drain."

Determined this time to catch the bastard, Marc sprinted from the building, Jörg struggling to keep up behind him. They raced out across the open grass, hoping that a direct and rapid assault would enable them to overwhelm their foe.\n\nWithout warning, a gunshot rang out from behind one of the barracks, the bullet screaming narrowly above Jörg's head and slamming into the grass. Caught out in the open, the two desperately ducked for cover behind the barracks, as Jörg returned fire with his luger. However, Marc was not quick enough as a bullet slammed into his leg and sent him tumbling to the ground.\n\nAs Marc screamed in pain, Jörg turned just in time to see the soldier emerging and striding with unnatural confidence towards them. He pulled his luger up to fire, but cursed as the empty gun merely clicked in his hands. Falling back behind the nearest building, he began to reload, only to realize that he had left his extra ammunition with the raiding party supply.\n\nMarc writhed on the floor as the figure approached.

The chase would also lead him past the shed where Ershat had met his bitter end. Jörg soon realized the true peril of the situation he was in. A pack of six men had hunted one lone wolf, but now only he remained, and the hunter had become the hunted.\n\nApproaching the fence where they entered, he cried out with horror as he saw that his pursuer had even had the damnable foresight to block that off.

Holding his weapon tightly, he swung wildly around the truck and-\n\nThere was nobody there.\n\nA moment's confusion was all he had before he heard the whooshing of air behind him.

He forgot, of course, that his opponent was wearing that thick visored helmet of the Guard. The only reaction from the soldier was a mild grunt of surprise. Amusement, even.\n\nCasting aside his axe, the soldier grabbed Jörg by the neck and began squeezing. Choking for air, he slammed his weapon furiously around hoping to strike some sensitive point. For a brief moment he could see the soldier's eyes through the visor, and saw for the first time the burning, malignant hatred.\n\nWith a sweep of his leg he was able to knock the soldier off balance, sending them both tumbling to the ground.

However, even the greatest soldiers can only do so well with an incompetent commander, let alone a blackout drunk one.\n\nAs the tide of the battle started turning against him, Dirlewanger's aides were terrified to tell him, afraid that he would shoot them in a drunken stupor. Rather, he did not notice until the sounds of enemy gunfire were disturbingly close to his position. Dirlewanger anxiously staggered out of his tent, flopped on top of his horse, and rode off-in the wrong direction. As he neared the enemy lines, the soldiers could hardly believe the sight: their deadliest foe, loping straight towards them and slurring a German drinking song. When he was less than ten feet away from the enemy, he finally realized something was amiss. He vacantly asked, "Wait, where am I?" and the soldier in front of him replied by unloading his submachine gun into Dirlewanger's skull."

He quickly let go of it, but then he saw the drops of blood leading further into the woods. The red trail was blocked by a bush, but not one to be stopped, the mercenary pushed through it. He was quickly drenched in the blood that the bush was soaked with but he continued. It was on the other side of the bush that he found the source. There it was, impaled on a large wooden spike. He recognized Dirlewanger's head, even if it was missing the eyes and a chunk of the lower jaw. Next to the head were the burned remains of his uniform, the stench of urine making it clear that it had been quite ruined even before the immolation. The rest of Dirlewanger's body was scattered about the clearing that the bush had concealed. The majority of his naked torso had been crudely nailed to a tree. There were limbs hanging from trees and half-buried guts in the snow. The mercenary wasn't sure how to react, his only thought being that he didn't want to meet the same fate.

The team's leader, Martin Valker, proclaimed that he had "killed the bastard", and requested immediate evacuation.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports that the higher echelons of the German Leadership are furious with the Shadow Division's diversion from its orders, but if this is true, they seem to have decided to conceal their feelings, and have publicly congratulated and honored the captain.

They attempted to catch up to their leader, only to find themselves increasingly delayed by engine troubles, inclement weather, and harassment by Russian partisans for weeks on end.\n\nWhen they finally found Dirlewanger's steamer, it was half-sunk by the banks of an abandoned Russian village. The rest of the crew were all dead, seemingly killed by bullets and bayonets. The only living man in the village was Dirlewanger himself, sitting emaciated, delirious, and half-dead in a hut. The men brought him back onto one their steamers and immediately headed downriver, hoping to return to Orsk and proper medical services posthaste. However, Dirlewanger's condition continued to deteriorate further, and he finally died less than a day away from Orsk.\n\nThe sight of Dirlewanger's body being unloaded into the brigade's camp immediately sparked chaos, which soon spiraled out into a free-for-all of blood and death.

As Dirlewanger was prepared for operation, his last words before losing consciousness were to his surgeons, telling them "I hope you are all German." He would never wake up again.\n\nThe surgery was ultimately a failure-blood had pooled in his lungs and suffocated him, they said-but it did reveal his cause of death: six shots, a unique type of 7.62mm ammunition used in Nagant revolvers, fired into his upper back at close range. The guards searched the camp trying to find anyone with a matching weapon, and soon they found their culprit: a new member named Ivan Bylinkin, who was caught trying to flee the campsite on horseback. After a brief interrogation, he confessed to the crime, with his hope of northern Russia's Soviet remnants welcoming him as a hero. Among his few possessions were letters drafted to important figures like General Georgy Zhukov and renowned aviatrix Yevdokia Bershanskaya, even asking for the latter's hand in marriage.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bylinkin was quickly executed by Dirlewanger's bodyguards after getting all the useful information they could.

As his life ebbed away, Dirlewanger realized that these were all the same men he had insulted for the final time mere hours previously, apparently led by his own second-in-command, Fritz Schmedes. When Schmedes gleefully went in for the coup de grace, all Dirlewanger could do before his world went dark was feebly curse his men for their ultimate betrayal.\n\nSchmedes then attempted to take control of the Brigade, but fortunately for the people of Russia, many of the bandits refused to recognize his leadership, and violence quickly broke out.

Tales abound from the south Urals of Direwanger being sighted in the depths of the darkest forests, in the dingy alleyways of bombed out cities, atop the peaks of the icy Ural mountains and under the beds of misbehaving Russian children.

A nearby villager swears that something fell from the sky and obliterated the whole camp, while another says that the bandits were all wiped out by plague. One of his soldiers even claimed that he had frozen to death and been eaten by starving bandits, explaining the lack of a corpse.

Reports claim that Dirlewanger left his camp several days ago, hearing of a particularly enticing stash of munitions stored in a mountain complex just Northeast of his territory. He brought with him a small contingent of his most loyal men, and a light pack of rudimentary camping gear. Unbeknownst to Oskar's brigade, as the small convoy vanished into the Siberian wilderness, it would be the last time that their leader would be seen alive. Almost a month later, they had not returned to camp. With infighting threatening to tear the group apart, a reconnaissance group was begrudgingly dispatched to retrieve information on the Bandit King's status. After a week of harsh travel, the recon mission came across a befuddling sight in an area known by natives as 'Dead Mountain'.\n\nWhat had appeared to be the remnants of the band's camp was buried halfway in snow. The large tent had a sizable hole on one of its walls, seemingly cut open with a knife. As the group followed a trail of light footprints down the hill to the edge of a nearby forest, they saw the corpses of two men, huddled around a nearby fire. Their bodies were coated in ice and nearly as pale as the snow they lied on. As they continued into the woods, they found a dark object sticking out of a nearby snowbank. It was the arm of Dirlewanger's malformed corpse, almost completely covered by rocks and ice. Before the group could even return the news to the remnants of the brigade, the brigade had split into rivaling cliques, many of which declared it 'disbanded'."

However, instead of keeping the hated marauder alive, the doctor used this as an opportunity to make Dirlewanger pay for all the misery he brought upon his family and the whole of Russia. Rather than giving him a proper medical treatment, the doctor injected Dirlewanger with what he called 'Sodium Tri-Ethalene', the doses of which were enough to kill a human being.

The man's face, hardly more mature than a child's, was lit by the flames, while Dirlewanger's ancient features were cloaked by the night.\n\nDirlewanger spoke with an icy tone that could freeze over the Atlantic. "Hand it over, boy."\n\nThe Russian bandit, due to the darkness, did not recognize his own leader. "Fuck off, old man."\n\nNo longer willing to deal with this, Dirlewanger reached for his pistol.

He drew his gun with the speed of a man who'd done it ten thousand times before and whipped around to deliver a shot, but for one of the first times ever he hesitated. In the darkness he saw a gaunt, skeletal face staring at him, with eyes just as cold as his own.\n\nIn that brief moment, the seemingly mirrored image of the bandit king lept and tackled Dirlewanger to the ground, pinning the elderly German to the jagged rocks and dry pine needles. Now with a better view, Dirlewanger realized that this wasn't a reflection, merely a man with a passing resemblance that had tripped him up. He tried to escape, but it was too late. The gaunt man bashed Dirlewanger's head in, leaving the monster dead. When his corpse was found, Dirlewanger's shoes, coat, and pistol had been taken away. The killer had been nothing more than a scavenger, not knowing that he was killing the scourge of Russia.

However, in a twist of fate, the universe deigned that this was not to be.\n\nThe next thing anyone heard was a scream, as Dirlewanger's weight on a section of the ladder never meant to hold a full grown man lead to it tipping over, directly onto a patch of waste material from the construction. As a mighty cloud of dust flew from the debris, and Dirlewanger lay strangely silent, the slave laborers hung back out of fear of the Bandit King, pretending nothing had happened to avoid a potential reprisal for the sin of getting in one of the Germans' way.\n\nEventually, half an hour later, while inspecting the construction, one of Dirlewanger's raiders found his body, skull caved in by an unfortunately-shaped log, and legs still lodged between the rungs of the ladder.\n\nOf course, by this time, the laborers were long gone, and heated arguments between the men that found the body had begun to lay the seeds of the 36th's death."

Crestfallen, the squabbling band fled back to their camp, losing several more men to falls and tree wells along the way.\n\nIt was not until days after the band had begun to disintegrate that Dirlewanger's corpse was finally found, frozen solid and half-buried under a snow drift. The Ural Guardsman that located him noticed two things, the first of which was the rot that had already set in across his body, turning an ugly, evil man into an even more ugly ruin of mummified flesh.

He swayed back and forth on the back of a half-scavenged Kettenkrad, out of his mind with bliss, and his men prowled the streets of the town, howling with laughter and drunkenness. They slipped into homes, in the pairs and quadruples, and soon the homes were alive with terrible noise, or silent.\n\nIn the second story of the building once known as a library, a hundred yards off, the sniper cleaned his rifle with a methodical ease. His name would be lost to time, but his deeds would not. He scrubbed the scope one last time, hefted the rifle onto the window-ledge, and aimed. NKVD agents 547b and 547a took their pistols to hand and began walking towards the main street. Their purpose had been made clear in the briefings. Failure was to be followed by termination. There would be only one window of opportunity for the action to be carried out. They reached the square, saw the figure dancing on the Kettenkrad, aimed. A lone gunman who had drifted down the swirl of dust and blood that was Western Russia had also turned up; radicalized by communism, he would be the one the Brigade punished with terrible fury in the final hours before it fell apart. He reached the horrified, staring crowds, pulled out a ludicrously long-barreled pistol, fired from the hip.\n\nThe bullets reached Oskar Dirlewanger and his team in 4.53 seconds, puncturing them in 15 separate places at different angles and rebounding. Oskar was killed instantly. Witnesses reported seeing the largest contiguous chunk of his head fall back, and to the left, before slapping on the pavement like so much rotten meat."

 ORS.483.desc:0 "It started with a small complaint about soreness in his lower back to the camp doctor. It was brushed off however, as being a result of a rough night's sleep, and could be avoided by sleeping face-up the following night. But the next morning, however, the problem did not go away, despite following the doctor's advice. However, it was not a debilitating issue, and it could not impede him from continuing to lead his men. But as time passed, Oskar Dirlewanger's situation continued to worsen. His back pain increased, going from a mild ache to a sharp, stabbing pain every time he walked or bent over. Formerly simple tasks, like riding a horse or firing a rifle, became unbearable tortures. Every time he tried, he felt a pain that he compared to someone holding his back over a bonfire.\n\nDirlewanger soon found himself bedridden, unable to even sit upright without subjecting himself to excruciating pain. He tried his best to continue running the Brigade, despite his camp doctors encouraging him to rest and avoid exerting himself too hard. Frankly, that was the only advice they could give, since they had no clue what could be causing this mysterious illness-was it a herniated disk? A pinched nerve? Some form of polio? They had no idea.\n\nFinally, Oskar Dirlewanger died one morning in his bed, howling with pain. Alcohol and morphine only provided brief respites from the suffering, and not even they could dull the pain he faced at the very end. When his cries finally stopped and he fell limp, the men of the Brigade silently felt relief that their overlord's suffering was over. But as the body grew cold, everyone realized something: Dirlewanger, delirious with pain, had never appointed a successor. Unsurprisingly, arguments about the Brigade's leadership soon escalated into firefights, and the camp fell into chaos that very day."

 ORS.484.desc:0 "In one of his numerous raids in Southern Russia, Dirlewanger heard a tale about a village church that contains priceless icons that the local residents consider to be sacred, but everyone who attempts to steal it from the villagers died a horrible death. Inspired to take another satanic feat of his name, Dirlewanger placed a bet to his fellow bandits to steal these famed artifacts and burn down the whole village, putting an end to this silly and childish legend. As the village was closely protected by a humongous mountainous barrier, Dirlewanger realized that the easiest route to it was lying across the river and assembled a few boats for his last adventure. In his hubris, however, Dirlewanger greatly overestimated the capabilities of his boat he was sitting on. After crossing half the river, his boat couldn't handle the pressure of a sitting crowd and thick bags with equipment. Crackling under such unbearable weight, the boat eventually broke down into tiny pieces, leaving Dirlewanger and his closest men to drown in the frozen river. As Dirlewanger quickly died from a heart attack after the shock from the cold water, his men on other boats could only watch the humiliating death of their leader, while planning to take his place as soon as they reach the shores.\n\nWith the Bandit King's death, the village population can now sleep calmly without fear to be attacked by the marauders, as Dirlewanger's men turned on each other as soon as they reached the land, leaving themselves incapable to launch a raid without their heads being raised on pitchforks by furious villagers, a fate which followed those unfortunate souls who didn't try to escape with captured loot of their former combatants."

They had dealt with resistance before, of course; that was to be expected. But organized fighting had been considered impossible on the part of the feeble Slavic peasant; and yet a group of them stood before Dirlewanger's personal detachment, demanding he leaves.\n\nOskar leaned out of the window of the truck and began shouting at them. "Get the hell out of my way!" He boomed. "Do you want to end up like everyone else who crossed me?!" The villagers looked at each other, smirking before an older man with a funny hat pulled a pistol out from his pants. He opened fire upon the vehicle, riddling the driver with bullets, and the peasants stormed the vehicle, killing the others in brutal close-quarters combat and dragging Dirlewanger out of the truck.\n\nThey threw him kicking and screaming into the middle of a circle formed by the villagers. He stood up, and looked around him, to see the angriest looking people he had ever seen. They stared him down, clutching their weapons, and he slowly assessed his situation. Dirlewanger gulped and closed his eyes. "Make it quick", he muttered, and they obliged."

Once the pillaging stopped, Oskar Dirlewanger and some of his officers went to the victory feast with Lysenko. Thousands of women also accompanied both Lysenko and Dirlewanger's men as the party appeared at the capitol building in Magnitogorsk. The party was both rambunctious and chaotic as thousands upon thousands of bottles of vodka were showered upon the Brigade. Oskar himself was of course delighted with the voluminous amounts of alcohol, and soon: his already terrible alcoholic rampage intensified as he spoke proudly of his brigade and started to ramble nonsense. These ramblings were a diverse mix of wishes, ranging from wanting to ravish every woman in Russia, to acquiring every single bottle of vodka his brigade could ever have. His drinking was coupled with his gorging on fresh chicken and bread that was perfectly created by Lysenko's chefs. He stuffed himself so much in his drunken glee, that he inevitably started choking. Before long, his men also started choking, and then followed by Dirlewanger himself who was also unable to breathe. He then looked up in pure agony and rage and saw a smiling Lysenko at the end of the dinner table, revealing a small vial of arsenic from his pocket. Before the clock struck midnight, every single officer in the Brigade was dead, killed by their own gluttony and wanton desires to pleasure themselves."

The broken and shackled men, women, and children within the experimental facilities have mostly been released from their cells by Dirlewanger's order, though this was only so they could be dealt with in typical Brigade fashion.\n\nSeveral of Lysenko's top scientists were able to flee the carnage, but Lysenko himself stayed to the last, dying in his office after a quick firefight. The dead mad scientist was dragged outside to the cheers of brigadiers and shocked silence of the captured researchers who had not yet been executed. The corpse was decapitated, and Lysenko's oh-so-intelligent head stuck on a pike. As for Lysenko's body, Dirlewanger himself was reported to have said, "leave it on the ground. It will be his last contribution to agriculture."\n\nWith Black Mountain in ruins, and the Brigade likely to soon pillage the area surrounding Magnitogorsk, the balance of power in the Urals has irrevocably changed. Time will tell if Dirlewanger's brigade will keep what they have taken here, but for now one thing is certain: the Urals no longer tremble at the thought of Lysenko.

All is not as peachy as Dirlewanger stated it to be, as while the vast majority of the Ural League's forces are now dead, there are still some who have fled to the wilderness and have reportedly vowed to continue fighting.\n\nThe brigade has become even more violent with the fall of their greatest enemy, and it seems that the Southern Urals have entered a new age of destruction and chaos..."

Its riches have been carted away by the soldiers, its people slaughtered by bloodthirsty bandits, and its leaders imprisoned, tortured, and executed. The Bandit King sits on a throne of the dead.\n\nThis all wasn't particularly difficult, of course. The militias of Orenburg were just that; militias, with no training, no standard equipment, and no competent leadership. Dirlewanger's army is bloodthirsty and barbaric, but no one can deny its skill in combat. The SS soldiers had no trouble gunning down the poor men fighting desperately to protect their homes and families, and any casualties they did inflict on the brigadiers were rare occurrences. For those who fled Orenburg, there was little quarter to be found.\n\nTonight, the men of Dirlewanger's Brigade dine and eat well, for they have well earned it. It will be interesting to see how long this good feeling lasts; whether more victories feed the mood, or defeat at the hands of capable enemies causes rifts within the bandit's camp."

Lysenko was once one of the most powerful leaders of the region. He set out on daring raids into every neighboring state and claimed themselves as the true successor of the Soviet science program. But the Ural League has defeated them, and they have raised their dirtied flags above the former dictatorial state and shown the inhabitants the might of their soldiers. Of course, this liberation is a lie, little more then a facade used as a fabrication for a power grab, but there is little we can do.\n\nAs the Ural League grows in power and Mendriks grows more greedy, we must turn our nation into a fortress. A fortress to resist all attacks. A fortress to retain the freedom of our men and the captivity of our slaves.

Today at exactly 08:00 the Black Bandit arrived with thirty of his best men at Lysenko's compound upon Black Mountain, bringing with them twenty of the choicest prisoners taken in our most recent raids, including a famous Soviet singer, as gifts for the mad scientist.\n\nThe meeting was far from typical meetings held between leaders, lavish dinners exchanged for much more practical uses of time. Upon Dirlewanger's arrival, he joined Lysenko to inspect the 22nd Motor Rifle Division NKVD, followed by a tour of Black Mountain's defensible positions. More excitingly, this was followed by a tour of several of Lysenko's laboratories and demonstrations of technology and techniques. One experiment demonstrated upon a young Polish woman brought particular delight from the Black Bandit.\n\nFinally, the day was concluded with a three-hour meeting between Dirlewanger, Lysenko and their respective translators. The two men appear to have taken a quick liking to each other, and the agreements between our forces and these boffins to finally destroy the Ural League has progressed significantly. For simply handing over the population we seize after our inevitable victory, we shall gain our pick of the countless technological marvels Black Mountain has hidden within for so long."

And the men did not speak, for the men were perhaps less than a quarter of their original number, and those that remained no longer trusted one another.\n\nNo longer was there a great bonfire in the center. There were only tiny campfires made of twigs and rubber scattered around, the small groups that still maintained some kind of criminal camaraderie huddling together, suspicious of every other group. Fritz Schmedes himself watched the scene from his window and sighed. They had to regroup soon.\n\nHe decided it was time for a brigade-wide meeting.

He instantly retreated, but he soon realized he wasn't the only target. The gunshot had triggered a chain reaction of panic, and soon the camp was in an open firefight with every man seemingly for himself. Why they were fighting or what they were fighting for no longer mattered. All that mattered was survival, for petty scraps of food and ammunition.
