  POLITICS_WILHELM_DOMMES_DESC:0 "Wilhelm Dommes never wanted to be in Afrika, and even now thinks only of how to escape it.\n\nAfter spending the Second World War as the only German commander to closely cooperate with the Japanese throughout the war, Dommes had expected a rapid promotion to the Seekriegsleitung. However, the rapid deterioration of German-Japanese relations after the war resulted in a speedy exile to Ostafrika, where his career languished for over a decade. Worse still, Dommes sat out the South African War, crawling in his skin as the American navy prevented his petty fleet from playing any active part.\n\nThroughout Huttig's reign, it was speculated he avoided being purged because the Afrikan Kriegsmarine was thought too irrelevant to bother with. Few, however, knew just how true that statement was. While Africa burned, Dommes used the Staathalter's bening ignorance to plot his escape, but being constantly frustrated by want of fuel. When the Vassallenstaat was reconquered, however, Dommes changed his plans: Quietly using the last of his supplies to relocate what remained of his fleet to the abandoned OFN naval base at Simons's Town, the Konteradmiral procured to secure control of the Cape in the inevitable event of the Reichstaat's collapse, and hand it in a silver plate to his former allies in exchange for rescue.\n\nUsing his influence with Rolf Mutzenburg and Hans Ulrich Rudel, both of whom he saved from execution by Huttig, Dommes painstakingly infiltrated Oberkommando Suidafrika in preparation for making his move. When news of Huttig's death reached Kapstadt, it took little effort to assasinate the hated Chielewinski and recall his troops to the Cape. Merging the late Kolonialwalter's command with his own "Seeverteidigung Simonstown," he has assembled a collection of weaponry ranging from the barely operable battleship Rodney to the most modern armor available to the defunct Queliame regime.\n\nNow that his plan is entering the final stretch, Dommes has only one objective: Survive until his negotiations with the Japanese guarantee him and his men a safe escape route. To this objective, he has established a temporary alliance with the Johannesburg "Republic" and OFN prisoners to the north, which few expect to last, even if it survives the impending ANC attack."
  POLITICS_JOHN_MCCAIN_III_DESC:0 "The son of a leading U.S. admiral, John McCain fought on his father's fleet as a naval aviator during the South African War, falling prisoner during a botched attempt to evacuate civilians from Cape Town at the tail end of the conflict.\n\nDuring his captivity, McCain experienced the horrors of Huttig's nightmare state, but remained unbroken. McCain was slated for transport to camps in the Reichstaat proper when the Boer Republic revolted, creating an opportunity he used to escape alongside his fellow prisoners. Over the subsequent months, he led the successful liberation of camp after camp, becoming recognized as the leader of a growing partisan movement, composed of American, Australian, New Zealander South African, Canadian, and even West Indian POWs which had been left behind.\n\nMcCain's sole objective during this time was simple: Escape Africa and return home. For this, however, he needed weapons. Out of this need arose an alliance between McCain's men and the DeBeers mining corporation. In exchange for acting as the company's protectors from Huttig's vengeance, and aiding the entry of its mercenaries into South Africa, McCain received shipments of rifles and ammunition. Now that Huttig's empire has finally collapsed, this arrangement has become plain for all to see, as McCain has officially pledged his allegiance to the reborn South African Republic and its mercenaries.\n\nMcCain knows that this war is his last chance to escape the continent, as do the tens of thousands of stranded OFN prisoners, who are desperate enough to accept, however grudgingly, the alliance of convenience between The Republic and the German remnants in the South."
  POLITICS_TAFFY_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Only the most insane of men would attempt to actively insert themselves into the hellish nightmare that was Huttig's Africa. One such man was Taffy Williams.\n\nAfter briefly serving in the Zentalafrikan wars during the 1950s, Williams returned to Europe for service by HMMLR during the English Civil War, missing out on the first two South African Wars due to the American blockade. However, Robert Oppenheimer's need for loyal mercenaries to protect the DeBeers-Anglo corporation, and now, to prop up his new "Republic," ensured the Englishman's return to the battlefields south of the Sahara.\n\nSmuggled into Mozambique in the aftermath of the second South African War, Williams was made head of the "DeBeers Protection Forces," an organization that has now become synonymous with the South African Army. In collaboration with McCain's men, also founded by DeBeers-Anglo, Williams effectively protected the company's assets from retribution by the SS until news of Huttig's death came.\n\nFollowing plans carefully laid by Oppenheimer, William's mercenaries easily toppled the disintegrating German administration, installing what is nominally a Republic with Oppenheimer as president. However, it is obvious that the government is little more than a front for corporate dominance, and that, for the moment, it is Taffy Williams, and not the President, who calls the shots."
  POLITICS_CONNIE_MULDER_DESC:0 "Connie Mulder is a disillusioned man. For years, he worked to bring the National Party to power, first as a councilman, then as a mayor, and finally, as an officer during the war. Even more so, he was one of the transvaal Boer's most pro-German politicians, staunchly opposing any expansion of American influence into South Africa. Yet for all of this, he now leads the revolt against those he wished to see rule.\n\nMulder watched in horror as the Boer Republic which he helped bring about was torn apart between its slavish loyalty to Huttig's regime in Queliame, the ceaseless native resistance to its existence, and the extremists in the Volksraad. Slowly but surely, the former teacher established connection with United Party politicians, knowing full well the regime couldn't last. Then came the overthrow of Hertzog, and it was worse than Mulder imagined.\n\nWhen the fragile government collapsed in the face of Malan's coup, Mulder was the only man with connections to both Boer loyalists and United Party politicians, and so he was unanimously elected president of a restored South Africa, with all three votes. In a sense, Mulder is little more than a puppet for the special interests who back his government, whose ultimate end is to restore the pre 1964 constitution. However, he also personifies the factionalism that the reborn South African state suffers from: As a lifelong segregationist, he is at odds with the remnants of the United Party who wish to use the war as an opportunity to end the practice once and for all."
  POLITICS_CONSTAND_VILJOEN_DESC:0 "In theory, Connie Mulder's restored South African government can count on the loyalty of the Union Defense Forces (UDF). As with most things in South Africa, reality is far more convoluted.\n\nConstand Viljoen belongs to a clique of younger officers who despised the Graff's government unwillingness to compromise with the native population. Although he initially defected to the Boers at the outbreak of the War, the entry of the Afrika-Schild and the volksraad submission to Huttig caused him to rescind his betrayal and rejoin the Union Defense Forces. From there, he rose to prominence as one of the UDF's most competent military commanders.\n\nViljoen was intelligent enough to go into hiding once it became obvious that the Schild would win the war. From his internal exile, Viljoen made clear his view that it was the politicians and their racial inflexibility that had lost South Africa, and later the Boer Republic, its freedom. Now in control of the lion's share of the reborn UDF, Viljoen is determined to prevent this from happening again. To many, Viljoen's bizarre claim that a Boer state is not incompatible with majority african rule carry the implication that he wishes for a federated South Africa.\n\nAlmost immediately, the general's insistence on closer cooperation with native African forces caused a break with the Cape Town government, from which the SALF is effectively independent. While Huttig's agents and Malan's Boers remain Viljoen's immediate concern, the General's ultimate aim is to create a new multiracial order that will prevent South Africa from being divided and conquered ever again. If Mulder, the natives, or anyone else proves an obstacle to this, Viljoen won't hesitate to turn his guns on them."
  POLITICS_MANGOSUTHU_BUTHELEZI_DESC:0 "The abject failure of the ANC to prevent a Boer takeover of South Africa proved to be the last straw for the organization's moderate faction. As the ANC's leaders were killed or exiled by Hertzog's regime, the ensuing power struggle for the organization's remnants was won by none other than Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi.\n\nOfficially only the hereditary leader of the Buthelezi tribe, Prince Mangosuthu is the de facto leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the largest ANC splinter group. Mangosuthu and the chief ideolouges of the IPF are steadfast in their belief that the ANC's extremism was the root of its failure, and that only by cooperating with sympathetic white governments will racial parity be achieved. In Spite of this moderation, the IPF goals are no less radical than those of the ANC, and the backlash from the Boer's horrific treatment of South Africa's natives has only further convinced the tribal leaders who prop-up Mangosuthu's government that segregation has to end, one way or another.\n\nThe thin line The Prince has to walk between ideological radicalism and his pragmatic strategy is represented by the unstable alliance of tribes that make up Mangosuthu's political front. While it is little more than an informal arrangement upheld almost entirely by personal loyalty to Mangosuthu, at a disadvantage in industrial capacity and military experience, the alliance nevertheless carries with it the ANC's unbreakable spirit. This makes an arrangement with Viljoen's moderate whites all the more pressing, for should Mangosuthu prove unable to fulfill his promises of a negotiated end to segregation, the IFP's more extremist elements could gain the upper hand."
  POLITICS_BEYERS_NAUDE_DESC:0 "Peace at any cost is the official doctrine of the Carnarvon Defense League, and of its leader.\n\nWhile Beyers Naudé himself was a segregationist long ago, the extremist attitudes of his fellow Boers, and the religious conviction of many ANC members, convinced the theologian that he was rooting for the wrong side. By the time of the Cape Town massacre, the cleric had established connections with underground ANC leaders, something which earned him the ire of Hertzog's secret policemen. Nevertheless, Naudé refused to go into hiding and continued to publicly criticize the government, an act that greatly increased the ANC's opinion of him.\n\nOnce Malan's coup set off Connie Mulder's rebellion in Cape Town, Naudé allies, white and black, seized control of the Northern Cape from the rapidly collapsing Boer security forces. Naudé's deeply religious understanding of South Africa resulted in his calls for a restoration of the pre war constitution, an end to segregation, co-operation between blacks and whites, expelling the Germans, and a federated structure for South Africa. His vision for a reconstructed South Africa convinced just about every major faction that Naudé was their natural ally.\n\nHowever, neither Mulder, nor Viljoen, nor Buthelezi could have predicted the establishment of the Carnarvon Defense League as a neutral zone. Armed to the teeth, Naudé has made it clear that the League will guarantee a safe place for those who wish to evade further suffering from war. Whether the League will weather the storm and remain intact is an open question, but Naudé's position as the most idealistic of contestants for the future of South Africa is already secured."
  POLITICS_KARL_CHMIELEWSKI_DESC:0 "Karl Chimelewiski was always considered to be below average in all aspects except one: Cruelty.\n\nChimelewiski once had a promising career in the German SS, as one of the few Camp Kommandants whose delight in torturing prisoners unsettled even Reinhard Heydreich. However, his excessive graft and violations of SS regulations ended his career with a permanent reassignment to Huttig's Ostafrika. Here, he was no one.\n\nFor years, the disgraced Camp Kommandant tried to gain the Reichkommissar's approval, to no avail. Even his plot to assassinate Ian Smith backfired when it interfered with his boss's plans. A lackluster performance as a Corps commander during the South African war seemed like his last posting, until Malan's rebellion forced Huttig to intervene in the country once more.\n\nSince Huttig's more competent generals were busy administering his domain, Chimelewiski was the only one left to put down the Boer rebellion. With little more than a full division and hatred for the Germans at an all time high, Chimelewinski knows that regaining control of the country is impossible, but he will at least try to evacuate as many German resources as possible before he is beaten back."

 MZB_REICHSTAAT.811.desc:0 "While the start of the war across the border had made the Germans giterry, it didn't make preparations any less necessary. Like all of Huttig's camps for OFN men, Stalag Luft XI was secured at all times by troops of what were once the Operational Garrisons of Ostafrika. Unlike the SS men, these treated American prisoners - the officers at least - semi decently. Nevertheless, it was still a POW camp, and despite his somewhat comfortable accommodations, it was his duty to escape.\n\nThe late fedelweb Blau's FN-LAG proved quite apt for the job of sniping the main guard tower out of existence. Of course, the shots alerted the remaining guards, but by this point it was too late. Half a dozen of them rushed out of the barracks only to meet their doom at the hands of one of their own Schmeisers, courtesy of another careless guard. Now it was time for the final base of his plan: He gave previously accorded signal - torching the barracks - and the remaining prisoners stormed out of their own blocks.\n\nIt wasn't long before Stalag Luft XI became a bloodbath, as the imprisoned airmen overrun their jailors, while the Lieutenant Commander led the few who had secured firearms straight into the camp's administration center, the door of which he made short work.\n\nInside, the smell of burning paper was strong, he could feel it. Indeed, he spotted the man in SS uniform trying to destroy the secret documents, but not before he spoke in his broken German accent, "I should it was..." the butt of the LAG tore a new hole through his face. "Take that you nazi fuck."\n\nWhen SS forces entered the camp the following morning, all they found on the inside of the burnt administration building was a coat, with the owner's name sawn to its back:"

Interrogation of captured Boer authorities have pointed to an initial breakout within the Reichstaat leading to the formation of an organized campaign by remaining OFN prisoners to escape.\n\nFurther investigation into the matter revealed that a large group, numbering around 20,000 under the leadership of American pilot John McCain, are operating across the area, and proved a large problem to the Boer government. The strength of this movement has been corroborated in the latest reports from my units operating on the Eastern Zone of the Vassalenstaad, which have come under attack by his forces. Efforts to liquidate this force have proven difficult, as they appear to be both highly organized and well armed. The source of this weaponry is unknown, but is under investigation."

When Huttig's goons had taken over the country, his Jewish background made him an overnight wanted criminal, but the authorities in the Boer Republic knew better than to arrest the owner of the largest mining corporation. Nevertheless, German rule was not kind to the business of diamond trading. The continuing embargo and arbitrary taxation was cutting into his profit margins. As it turned out, it was cutting into DeBeer's ability to operate at all.\n\n"There's nothing to be done." Oppenheimer said it to no one in particular. No matter what financial wizardry he undertook, there was no escaping the looming insolvency. The time had come to do what he once thought unthinkable, crestfallen, he turned to his secretary. "Ian, tell the Anglo people I accept the offer." His stomach sunk, to merge with his biggest rival while hiding away like a rat in his own mines. All of his efforts to keep DeBeers running through his proxies in the board had been to no avail. A steady stream of tears had already begun to run down Oppenheimer's face when he pulled back his chair. While he was down, he was not out. If anything, he could look to this merger as an opportunity. While he would temporarily lose the absolute control he had over his business, it was hardly the end of the world.\n\nOppenheimer knew one day Huttig's grasp over South Africa would have to slip, sooner or later. Whenever that day came, he would be ready. All that he needed to do now was be prepared, and he knew just who to call."

He'd lost more than enough men to the shrapnel from seemingly random bombing attacks by Huttig's forces to know that. Scurrying under the cover of the trees behind him, Leo Profilet was short of breath by the time he reached McCain.\n\n"They're coming Lieutenant, the Aussies saw them cross the border half an hour ago!" Profilet swap his hand across his face to get rid of some sweat.\n\n"Alright then." McCain raised his FN-LAG and gave a look to the much older John Flynn, another fallen airman whose rank would have made him the leader of the group, if the chain of command existed as it did during the war. Flynn had grabbed his own rifle and was going down the road to join David Winn in a foxhole. McCain gestured the appropriate hand movements to his men on the other side of the dirt road, covered in the same amount of foliage. Their figures merged into the green leaves, with only the most careful onlooker being able to notice the blackness of their gun's barrels.\n\nMcCain waited for their appearance, and then waited some more. So obsessed was he with spotting the figure of a uniformed man on the road that he almost missed the sound of a branch cracking under the pressure of a boot in the trees behind him. A shot rang out, and then some more, one of his men must have spotted the figures descending from the mound. Barely avoiding the bullets himself, McCain managed to shout, "HOLD YOUR FIRE," in time to avoid any serious problems to arise from the incident.\n\n"Are you done yet, Lieutenant?" from behind a bush some two hundred meters up the small hill, the recognizable British accent called out to him. After a few moments of silence, the helmeted figure emerged from the same spot. "Well, would have been a shame to get killed here after all the effort it took us to get into Mozambique in the first place." Why anyone in his right mind would try to get into Africa was beyond McCain's capability to understand, but DeBeers had made him a promise: Help the mercenaries in, and they'd help him get his men out, eventually. By now, the Englishman had made his way down the hill and extended his hand to McCain, right as the other mercenaries rose from their hastily taken cover."

With the American fleet having blocked any action on its part throughout the entirety of the South African War, it had gained little of status or glory in the eyes of Hans Huttig. Even after that it proved too small to have a major contribution in helping the beleaguered SS to combat the endless numbers of uprisings that assailed it. Worst of all: It was falling apart at the seams\n\nIt had been years since the last shipment of spare parts from the Heimat, and the ships of the Afrikaner Kriegsmarine, already old in 1962, were beginning to malfunction. Boiler breakdowns, broken hydraulic systems on turrets, and leaks had long been a problem, and the inadequate dockyards of Kongo and Mozambique were not helping the situation, either. Germany had never invested into these ports with the intention of making them into self-sufficient naval bases, and the consequences of that were now beginning to show. The atrophied machinery of the steel behemoths which once guarded Deutsch-Afrika desperately needed maintenance, and there was only one place in the continent were it could get it.\n\nFor Wilhelm Dommes, it was ironic that the last refuge of the fleet would be Cape Town. For the two decades, while his career had stagnated in Ostafrika, he and Rolf Mutzenberg spent many a general staff meeting planning the glorious day in which the Kriegsmarine would take the largest port south of Suez. Now, he led the decrepit remains of an outlaw fleet into indefinite mothballitude.\n\nLooking out from the bridge of his flagship, Dommes saw Dar es Salaam fade away into the distance. He would have taken the opportunity to desert, he'd worked with the Japanese during the war... still on friendly terms with some of their admirals... but there wasn't enough fuel. For now, all that remained was to reach Simonstown Naval base scavenge whatever the OFN had left behind and hadn't been destroyed during the reconquest of the Vasallenstaat."

Dommmes gave a look at the subaltern gunnery officer, who in turn transmitted the orders through the Doktor Goebbel's intercom system. It took a minute before the 260mm guns of the cruiser roared into action, spewing out their shells into Cape Town's slums. The other ships moored at Simonstown, as well as those in Robben Island followed shortly thereafter, even the repurposed hulk of the HMS Rodney joined in. Dommes dreaded the act of having to do this, he'd seen enough killing in his lifetime, but he could not afford to lose Cape Town, or else his plan to return home would be ruined.\n\nIt took thirty minutes of shelling until the ground forces reported that the ANC rebels had surrendered. Dommes was lucky insofar as the uprising was spontaneous, he'd feared that it would have taken leveling the entire city in order to maintain control.

Being pressed into Reichskomissar Schenk's SS, his Khoisan people performed gallantly in the war, when their outdoors skills and knowledge of the land made them capable of ambushing even the most talented American units. Yet none of that mattered to Hans Huttig, who saw them as nothing more than pests to be exterminated.\n\nBut Huttig didn't know why the Khoisan managed to survive this long: They understand that Man is a weak animal. Mankind will never be as strong as a lion or as fast as a leopard, but no other animal has the will of humans. We rely on our persistence to endure in the wildness, and Matoka's people persisted in the bush like a cleaver prey evades their predator.\n\nNow its time for Africa's oldest people to go out on the hunt again, waiting in silence for days until their prey walk right into the set trap.
