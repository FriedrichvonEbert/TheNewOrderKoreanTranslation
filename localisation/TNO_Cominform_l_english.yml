 socintern.0.t:0 "사회주의 인터내셔널의 총회가 이제 준비되다"
 socintern.0.d:0 "Ever since the creation of the Socialist Internationale, work has been on going to prepare a great assembly. There, representatives of the world's socialist parties would be able to gather to discuss issues and propose various motions. Today, the work is complete and the Assembly is ready!\n\nMembers of the SocIntern will be able to propose motions, and vote on them through a secret ballot. The addition of the Assembly to the organization's charter will no doubt prove to be an important tool in the struggle to advance Socialism internationally."

 socintern.1.d:0 "An invitation has arrived today from [FROM.GetNameDef] inviting our ruling party into the Socialist International as associate member. This new organization, often shortened to the "SocIntern" is meant to bring together all those who fight for the rights of workers and the advancement of mankind toward socialism.\n\nOur party has received an invitation of associate membership; this position would allow us to observe the organization's meetings, and perhaps in the future join it fully. The [FROM.GetAdjective]s await our reply as to our decision concerning joining the SocIntern or not."

 socintern.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 회원국 지위를 받아들이다"
 socintern.3.d:0 "We've received news that the ruling party of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the Socialist Internationale as a full member. We can look forward to seeing their contributions and proposals in the SocIntern's meetings."
 socintern.3.a:0 "환영하오, 동지들!"

 socintern.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 제휴국 지위를 받아들이다"
 socintern.4.d:0 "We've received news that the ruling party of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the Socialist Internationale as an associate member. Their presence as observers on the organization's meeting will let them gauge our progress, and in time perhaps the closer ties between our nations will lead to their growth into full membership."
 socintern.4.a:0 "환영하오, 동지들!"

 socintern.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 초대를 거절하다"
 socintern.5.d:0 "Sadly, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] will not join the Socialist Internationale. Representatives of their ruling party have politely but firmly turned down our invitation to join the new organization and its fight for workers' rights and socialism. Perhaps [FROM.GetNameDef] will show more interest in the future; for now joining the SocIntern is simply not within their priorities."
 socintern.5.a:0 "유감스럽군."

 socintern.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef]로부터의 초청"
 socintern.6.d:0 "Good news! It seems like our brothers in the global socialist movement have recognized our contributions to the struggle against capitalism and socialism and have been invited to the Rykov Conference! This is our chance to hobnob with the highest placed leaders of the proletariat, and encourage the networks that will broaden the success of the great revolution (and the prestige of our own nation).\n\nAlready our diplomats and party officials are competing for coveted spots among the guest list, hoping to be the ones to represent their nation among the emerging global movement. Without a doubt, we will demonstrate to our allies that we are a true partner in the march for justice and equality."
 socintern.6.a:0 "우리는 기꺼이 참석할 것이다"
 socintern.6.b:0 "우린... 바빠."

 socintern.7.t:0 "리코프 회의"
 socintern.7.d:0 "Excellent news! The Rykov Conference has been a splendid affair. The parties invited were cordial and honest, as old enmities were swept beneath the tide of global revolution. The minor disputes that occurred were quickly settled by the conference chairs, and on the whole the meeting was both productive and enjoyable.\n\nIf the conference is any indication, it appears that the ideological force of Socialism will once again return to the global scene. Let the worldwide enemies of the proletariat and popular justice tremble before the awesome power of the allied socialist nations!"
 socintern.7.a:0 "국제적인 이상이 인류를 통합하다!"

 socintern.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 소인테른의 회원국 지위를 요청하다"
 socintern.8.d:0 "Every day seems to bring new triumphs for the nations of the SocIntern. Our ranks are expanding, our economic output is expanding, and even the nations most submerged in the filth of fascism and capitalism are beginning to feel the first tremors of the socialist earthquake.\n\nWe have recently received yet another application for full membership from the nation of [FROM.GetNameDef], whose people have felt the siren call of the global revolution. No doubt their presence among our faction will strengthen our capabilities against the enemies of the proletariat worldwide."
 socintern.8.a:0 "우리는 기꺼이 받아들일 것이다."
 socintern.8.b:0 "우리는 그들과 관계를 맺을 의사가 없다."

 socintern.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 우리의 신청을 받아주다"
 socintern.9.d:0 "When our nation first began its path towards membership in the SocIntern, many called it a fool's errand. After all, the power of the bourgeoisie is formidable, and their will to crush any stirrings among the proletariat absolute. But in spite of the odds and naysayers, our ruling party vanquished its foes and now dominates local politics. Even this victory appeared fragile until recently we received word that our government's application to the SocIntern has been accepted. We are now acknowledged as an equal by the greatest socialist powers of the world, and stand besides them in their struggle."
 socintern.9.a:0 "훌륭하군!"

 socintern.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 우리의 신청을 거절하다"
 socintern.10.d:0 "Terrible news! It seems that the leadership of the SocIntern has been corrupted by the very forces of capitalism and revisionism that they claim to fight against, how else can we explain their rejection of our application for full membership?\n\nHopefully in time, the winds of change will displace these two-faced fools and replace them in the movement's leadership position with nations more committed to the global revolution, but until then it seems that we must struggle against the capitalist oppressors on our own.\n\nPainful as it might be to be separated from our comrades, we must continue onwards, until one day our fellow proletarian governments see the light and acknowledge us once more."
 socintern.10.a:0 "유감스럽군."

 socintern.11.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 소인테른의 제휴국 지위를 요청하다"
 socintern.11.d:0 "The winds of change, the basic forces of economics, and the inevitable victory of the socialist revolution cannot be rushed. Attempting to bring about our final victory before its time will only delay the day of triumph -- as the Bukharinists learned to their sorrow. Therefore, although it is saddening that they had not considered themselves worth of full membership, the application of [FROM.GetName] to join the SocIntern as an associate nation is still cause for celebration. We must now determine whether they are worthy of this honor, or if their form of socialism is insufficient for the needs of the global proletariat."
 socintern.11.a:0 "우리는 기꺼이 받아들일 것이다."
 socintern.11.b:0 "우리는 그들과 관계를 맺을 의사가 없다."
 
 socintern.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 우리의 신청을 받아주다"
 socintern.12.d:0 "Excellent news on the diplomatic front. We have recently received an official communique from the SocIntern high council formally accepting our nation into the pact as an associate member.\n\nThis is good news for our government, we are now poised to either join the organization in full should we consider it useful for our interests, or to leave with few repercussions if it is not. We can only hope that our new allies understand our position, and are able to win our trust."
 socintern.12.a:0 "훌륭하군!"

 socintern.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetName]이/가 우리의 신청을 거절하다"
 socintern.13.d:0 "Tragic news from the diplomatic front. It seems that the fools in the SocIntern leadership have rejected our membership in their special club. Although we had hoped to head off this scenario by requesting membership as an associate rather than in full, even this was not enough for the so-called "leadership" of the organization. Despite this humiliation, our nation has not abandoned our commitment to the workers of the world, though we will have to find alternative channels to express it."
 socintern.13.a:0 "유감스럽군."

 socintern.0.t:0 "총회가 개최되다"
 socintern.0.d:0 "Ever since the creation of the Socialist Internationale, work has been on going to prepare a great assembly.

 socintern.0.a:0 "만국의 노동자들에게 영광스러운 날이로군!"

 socintern.14.t:0 "상호 불가침 조약이 제안되다"
 socintern.14.d:0 "It is time for the SocIntern to consider a new proposal. One of the nations has proposed a mutual non-aggression pact between all SocIntern nations. They argue that the revolution must not fall to infighting, and that this pact is the first step towards making the SocIntern a viable force within global politics. Of course, not everyone agrees, and some claim that this would be both a waste of time, and that this pact would unfairly restrict the sovereignty of the member nations."
 socintern.14.a:0 "매우 흥미롭군."
 socintern.14.b:0 "발의안을 찬성하자."
 socintern.14.c:0 "발의안에 거부권을 행사하자."

 socintern.15.t:0 "상호 불가침 조약이 거부되다"
 socintern.15.d:0 "It appears that the General-Secretary of the SocIntern did not agree with the reasoning behind the mutual non-aggression pact. Whatever their reasons were, the motion has been vetoed. If the General Assembly does not vote to overturn the veto, the proposal will fail and be shelved for now. If we overturn the veto, the proposal must be voted upon once more in the General Assembly to see if the motion actually passes or not. As it stands currently, we can either vote to overturn the veto, vote against overturning the veto, or abstain from voting."
 socintern.15.a:0 "번복되기를 빌며 투표하자."
 socintern.15.b:0 "거부권을 유지하는데 투표하자."
 socintern.15.c:0 "기권하자."

 socintern.16.t:0 "서기장의 거부권이 무효화되다"
 socintern.16.d:0 "The General Assembly has voted, and the results are clear: the General Assembly has voted to overturn the General-Secretary's veto. This means that the mutual non-aggression pact has survived, and will pass on to the General Assembly, where the motion shall be voted upon once more. While the General Assembly could vote against the motion, many agree that the motion's chances of passing are fairly decent."
 socintern.16.a:0 "Onto the vote."

 socintern.17.t:0 "거부권이 유지되다"
 socintern.17.d:0 "It appears that the General-Secretary's decision will not be opposed by the General Assembly, and that the veto will not be overturned. The motion for a mutual non-aggression pact has been killed, and some of the delegations seem disappointed with the outcome. However, what's done is done, and the motion will be shelved for now. The mutual non-aggression pact may be proposed again in the future, but for now the SocIntern must turn their attention to other matters."
 socintern.17.a:0 "아주 좋아."

 socintern.18.t:0 "불가침 조약에 대한 투표"
 socintern.18.d:0 "The proposal for the mutual non-aggression pact between all SocIntern members has reached the General Assembly. The debates from earlier have been revived, attempting to sway votes to their side at the eleventh hour. The proponents for the motion claim there is no valid reason to oppose such a motion, claiming that only traitors to the revolution would refuse to sign such a thing. The opponents claim that it is not for the SocIntern to determine such matters, and that it should be up to the individual nations to determine their own diplomacy.\n\nEventually, the debates and arguments ended, and the vote could finally occur. Now is the time for decisions to be made. Do we vote in favor of the motion, against the motion, or abstain?"
 socintern.18.a:0 "찬성에 투표하자."
 socintern.18.b:0 "반대에 투표하자"
 socintern.18.c:0 "기권하자."

 socintern.19.t:0 "불가침 조약이 통과되다"
 socintern.19.d:0 "The General Assembly has finished voting, and it seems that the General Assembly has decided to pass the motion. Now all members of the SocIntern shall have mutual non-aggression pacts between them, preventing them from going to war with each other. Some proponents of the motion claim that this is a key step towards a truly international revolution. While it is still far too early to claim or suggest such ideas, the proponents of the mutual non-aggression pact still have reason to celebrate. With the motion passed, the matter of the mutual non-aggression pact has been resolved, and the SocIntern can turn its attention to other matters."
 socintern.19.a:0 "세상은 평화롭다."

 socintern.20.t:0 "불가침 조약이 거부되다"
 socintern.20.d:0 "The General Assembly has finished voting, and it seems that the motion has failed. There shall be no mutual non-aggression pact between SocIntern nations, and the proposal will be shelved for now. This is not necessarily the end of such a proposal, and it may return in the future. However, for now the delegations must be content with the current vote's outcome, as the SocIntern turns its attention to other matters."
 socintern.20.a:0 "연대에 대한 타격인가?"

 socintern.20.t:0 "총회가 휴회하다"
 socintern.20.d:0 "The matter of the latest proposal has been concluded, and the decision finalized. Regardless of the outcome or the opinions of the delegations, there is nothing more to say on the matter.\n\nAs such, the General Assembly has gone into recess until the next proposal is put forth. The assembly has been adjourned, and the various delegations return to their respective embassies and governments to report the events of the meeting. They also return to discuss their plans for the future regarding the SocIntern, and the next assembly will likely be just as eventful as the last."
 socintern.20.a:0 "알았다."

 comecon.1.d:0 "When our comrades are in great struggle, it is upon us to come to their aid. The common people of [From.GetName], from the miners and soldiers to the bureaucrats and generals, are in a great struggle. The bourgeoisie of the world, from the black fascism of the Germans, to the decadent imperialism of the Japanese, to the capitalistic slavery that inhabits and infests the American spirit; all stand tall and oppress the worker. In their moral struggle against these corrupt powers, the siren song of nationalism and greed promising an escape from unideal circumstances, the [From.GetNameAdj] people called out for aid from the rest of our International.\n\nWe have spared no expense, providing resources beyond measure to our allies, most of all being our camaraderie.

There is often not enough food, not enough work, not enough for the common [From.GetNameAdj] worker to thrive. We have worked hard in maintaining and building our Revolution, but we must humbly call upon our Comrades abroad for aid. If we can build up our industry, our economy, our people, then we can ensure the prosperity of every [From.GetNameAdj].\n\n- On Behalf of the [From.GetNameAdj] People\n\nNow, we have our choice.

Before we can smile at the fortune of our government and people, we must decide what we shall dedicate our new resource to.\n\nWe can add it to ourLiquid Reserves, gaining significant financial boons, however this gain will be only in the short-term.\n\nWe can dedicate it to a variety of long term programs, which would grow our humble economy overtime.\n\nWe can cement our dedication to the socialistic promise, and distribute the wealth to the humble worker, which would greaten the equality of our society.\n\nUltimately, we must decide what to do with the funds, and we will..."

These funds will be used for the economic development of our fellow socialistic nations, from construction and investment, to social aid packages that lift the Humble Worker out of poverty. If we need the financial support during a time of great economic crisis, or out of the simple need to fund development projects, we are able to withdraw funds. For now, though, we are presently depositing funds for our comrades across the world to use.\n\nNow that our humble donation to the fund has been agreed upon, the only question remains is the size of our contribution."

Of course, our present ambitions may require a larger amount of financial support.

 comecon.10.d:0 "The Fatal Flaw of the capitalist ideology, reduced to its basest element, is the inherent subsidization of greed within the hearts of men. This subsidization draws from the degenerative focus on competition, where only the "fittest" can survive. The common claim has been that competition drives forth innovation, and the success of American industry has been pointed to as proof of such. There is a new argument, though. This American technological prowess exists not because of competing corporations, searching to squeeze out every last dime of the humble worker's labour, but in spite of them.\n\nToday, we join something larger than petty, barbaric fighting over knowledge that could be shared. Today, we find that cooperation will bring us the international socialist future that all of us have dreamed of, by way of technology. Today, we join our comrades across the globe, and join the COMECON Scientific Bureau. Our cooperation is our strength, not our weakness, and the people shall be ascendant."

There are different ways that we can use the resources that we have been given, we must simply act on them. The most simple of ideas is creating a new facility somewhere within our nation for industrial production, the Blueprints and Funds being put towards the construction of a factory. On the other hand, we have the ability to learn more about productivity and efficiency, using the blueprints and these foreign experts as ways to teach more innovative methods to our domestic forces. A third option, as well, is that we may simply use the funds to massively produce more equipment for our ever-beating economy.\n\nThe choice remains, what shall we do?"
