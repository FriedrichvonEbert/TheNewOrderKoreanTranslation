 socintern.0.t:0 "The Socialist International's Assembly Is Now Ready"
 socintern.0.d:0 "Ever since the creation of the Socialist Internationale, work has been on going to prepare a great assembly. There, representatives of the world's socialist parties would be able to gather to discuss issues and propose various motions. Today, the work is complete and the Assembly is ready!\n\nMembers of the SocIntern will be able to propose motions, and vote on them through a secret ballot. The addition of the Assembly to the organization's charter will no doubt prove to be an important tool in the struggle to advance Socialism internationally."
 socintern.0.a:0 "A glorious day for workers of the world!"

 socintern.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Offers SocIntern Membership"
 socintern.1.d:0 "An invitation has arrived today from [FROM.GetNameDef] inviting our ruling party into the Socialist International as associate member. This new organization, often shortened to the “SocIntern” is meant to bring together all those who fight for the rights of workers and the advancement of mankind toward socialism.\n\nOur party has received an invitation of associate membership; this position would allow us to observe the organization's meetings, and perhaps in the future join it fully. The [FROM.GetAdjective]s await our reply as to our decision concerning joining the SocIntern or not."
 socintern.1.a:0 "We would gladly accept."
 socintern.1.b:0 "Accept associate status."
 socintern.1.c:0 "We have no desire to associate ourselves with the SocIntern."
 
 socintern.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Offers SocIntern Associate Status"
 socintern.2.d:0 "An invitation has arrived today from [FROM.GetNameDef] inviting our ruling party into the Socialist International as associate member. This new organization, often shortened to the “SocIntern” is meant to bring together all those who fight for the rights of workers and the advancement of mankind toward socialism.\n\nOur party has received an invitation of associate membership; this position would allow us to observe the organization's meetings, and perhaps in the future join it fully.

 socintern.2.b:0 "We have no desire to associate ourselves with the SocIntern."

 socintern.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts SocIntern Membership"
 socintern.3.d:0 "We've received news that the ruling party of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the Socialist Internationale as a full member. We can look forward to seeing their contributions and proposals in the SocIntern's meetings."
 socintern.3.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"

 socintern.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts SocIntern Associate Status"
 socintern.4.d:0 "We've received news that the ruling party of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join the Socialist Internationale as an associate member. Their presence as observers on the organization's meeting will let them gauge our progress, and in time perhaps the closer ties between our nations will lead to their growth into full membership."
 socintern.4.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"

 socintern.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Declines Our Offer"
 socintern.5.d:0 "Sadly, it seems that [FROM.GetNameDef] will not join the Socialist Internationale. Representatives of their ruling party have politely but firmly turned down our invitation to join the new organization and its fight for workers' rights and socialism. Perhaps [FROM.GetNameDef] will show more interest in the future; for now joining the SocIntern is simply not within their priorities."
 socintern.5.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 socintern.6.t:0 "An Invitation From [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 socintern.6.d:0 "Good news! It seems like our brothers in the global socialist movement have recognized our contributions to the struggle against capitalism and socialism and have been invited to the Rykov Conference! This is our chance to hobnob with the highest placed leaders of the proletariat, and encourage the networks that will broaden the success of the great revolution (and the prestige of our own nation).\n\nAlready our diplomats and party officials are competing for coveted spots among the guest list, hoping to be the ones to represent their nation among the emerging global movement. Without a doubt, we will demonstrate to our allies that we are a true partner in the march for justice and equality."
 socintern.6.a:0 "We would gladly attend."
 socintern.6.b:0 "We're... busy."

 socintern.7.t:0 "The Rykov Conference"
 socintern.7.d:0 "Excellent news! The Rykov Conference has been a splendid affair. The parties invited were cordial and honest, as old enmities were swept beneath the tide of global revolution. The minor disputes that occurred were quickly settled by the conference chairs, and on the whole the meeting was both productive and enjoyable.\n\nIf the conference is any indication, it appears that the ideological force of Socialism will once again return to the global scene. Let the worldwide enemies of the proletariat and popular justice tremble before the awesome power of the allied socialist nations!"
 socintern.7.a:0 "The International Ideal unites the human race!"

 socintern.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Seeks SocIntern Membership"
 socintern.8.d:0 "Every day seems to bring new triumphs for the nations of the SocIntern. Our ranks are expanding, our economic output is expanding, and even the nations most submerged in the filth of fascism and capitalism are beginning to feel the first tremors of the socialist earthquake.\n\nWe have recently received yet another application for full membership from the nation of [FROM.GetNameDef], whose people have felt the siren call of the global revolution. No doubt their presence among our faction will strengthen our capabilities against the enemies of the proletariat worldwide."
 socintern.8.a:0 "We would gladly accept."
 socintern.8.b:0 "We have no desire to associate ourselves with them."

 socintern.9.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts Our Application"
 socintern.9.d:0 "When our nation first began its path towards membership in the SocIntern, many called it a fool's errand. After all, the power of the bourgeoisie is formidable, and their will to crush any stirrings among the proletariat absolute. But in spite of the odds and naysayers, our ruling party vanquished its foes and now dominates local politics. Even this victory appeared fragile until recently we received word that our government's application to the SocIntern has been accepted. We are now acknowledged as an equal by the greatest socialist powers of the world, and stand besides them in their struggle."
 socintern.9.a:0 "Excellent!"

 socintern.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Declines Our Application"
 socintern.10.d:0 "Terrible news! It seems that the leadership of the SocIntern has been corrupted by the very forces of capitalism and revisionism that they claim to fight against, how else can we explain their rejection of our application for full membership?\n\nHopefully in time, the winds of change will displace these two-faced fools and replace them in the movement's leadership position with nations more committed to the global revolution, but until then it seems that we must struggle against the capitalist oppressors on our own.\n\nPainful as it might be to be separated from our comrades, we must continue onwards, until one day our fellow proletarian governments see the light and acknowledge us once more."
 socintern.10.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 socintern.11.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Seeks SocIntern Associate Status"
 socintern.11.d:0 "The winds of change, the basic forces of economics, and the inevitable victory of the socialist revolution cannot be rushed. Attempting to bring about our final victory before its time will only delay the day of triumph -- as the Bukharinists learned to their sorrow. Therefore, although it is saddening that they had not considered themselves worth of full membership, the application of [FROM.GetName] to join the SocIntern as an associate nation is still cause for celebration. We must now determine whether they are worthy of this honor, or if their form of socialism is insufficient for the needs of the global proletariat."
 socintern.11.a:0 "We would gladly accept."
 socintern.11.b:0 "We have no desire to associate ourselves with them."
 
 socintern.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Accepts Our Application"
 socintern.12.d:0 "Excellent news on the diplomatic front. We have recently received an official communique from the SocIntern high council formally accepting our nation into the pact as an associate member.\n\nThis is good news for our government, we are now poised to either join the organization in full should we consider it useful for our interests, or to leave with few repercussions if it is not. We can only hope that our new allies understand our position, and are able to win our trust."
 socintern.12.a:0 "Excellent!"

 socintern.13.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDef] Declines Our Application"
 socintern.13.d:0 "Tragic news from the diplomatic front. It seems that the fools in the SocIntern leadership have rejected our membership in their special club. Although we had hoped to head off this scenario by requesting membership as an associate rather than in full, even this was not enough for the so-called "leadership" of the organization. Despite this humiliation, our nation has not abandoned our commitment to the workers of the world, though we will have to find alternative channels to express it."
 socintern.13.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 socintern.0.t:0 "The General Assembly Opens"
 socintern.0.d:0 "Ever since the creation of the Socialist Internationale, work has been on going to prepare a great assembly. There, representatives of the world's socialist parties would be able to gather to discuss issues and propose various motions. Today, the work is complete and the Assembly is ready!\n\nMembers of the SocIntern will be able to propose motions, and vote on them through a secret ballot. The addition of the Assembly to the organization's charter will no doubt prove to be an important tool in the struggle to advance Socialism internationally."
 socintern.0.a:0 "A glorious day for workers of the world!"

 socintern.14.t:0 "Mutual Non-Aggression Pact Proposed"
 socintern.14.d:0 "It is time for the SocIntern to consider a new proposal. One of the nations has proposed a mutual non-aggression pact between all SocIntern nations. They argue that the revolution must not fall to infighting, and that this pact is the first step towards making the SocIntern a viable force within global politics. Of course, not everyone agrees, and some claim that this would be both a waste of time, and that this pact would unfairly restrict the sovereignty of the member nations."
 socintern.14.a:0 "Intriguing."
 socintern.14.b:0 "Approve the motion."
 socintern.14.c:0 "Veto the motion."

 socintern.15.t:0 "Mutual Non-Aggression Pact Vetoed"
 socintern.15.d:0 "It appears that the General-Secretary of the SocIntern did not agree with the reasoning behind the mutual non-aggression pact. Whatever their reasons were, the motion has been vetoed. If the General Assembly does not vote to overturn the veto, the proposal will fail and be shelved for now. If we overturn the veto, the proposal must be voted upon once more in the General Assembly to see if the motion actually passes or not. As it stands currently, we can either vote to overturn the veto, vote against overturning the veto, or abstain from voting."
 socintern.15.a:0 "Vote to overturn."
 socintern.15.b:0 "Vote to maintain the veto."
 socintern.15.c:0 "Abstain from the decision."

 socintern.16.t:0 "General Secretary Veto Overturned"
 socintern.16.d:0 "The General Assembly has voted, and the results are clear: the General Assembly has voted to overturn the General-Secretary's veto. This means that the mutual non-aggression pact has survived, and will pass on to the General Assembly, where the motion shall be voted upon once more. While the General Assembly could vote against the motion, many agree that the motion's chances of passing are fairly decent."
 socintern.16.a:0 "Onto the vote."

 socintern.17.t:0 "The Veto Stands"
 socintern.17.d:0 "It appears that the General-Secretary's decision will not be opposed by the General Assembly, and that the veto will not be overturned. The motion for a mutual non-aggression pact has been killed, and some of the delegations seem disappointed with the outcome. However, what's done is done, and the motion will be shelved for now. The mutual non-aggression pact may be proposed again in the future, but for now the SocIntern must turn their attention to other matters."
 socintern.17.a:0 "Very well."

 socintern.18.t:0 "Voting on the Non-Aggression Pact"
 socintern.18.d:0 "The proposal for the mutual non-aggression pact between all SocIntern members has reached the General Assembly. The debates from earlier have been revived, attempting to sway votes to their side at the eleventh hour. The proponents for the motion claim there is no valid reason to oppose such a motion, claiming that only traitors to the revolution would refuse to sign such a thing. The opponents claim that it is not for the SocIntern to determine such matters, and that it should be up to the individual nations to determine their own diplomacy.\n\nEventually, the debates and arguments ended, and the vote could finally occur. Now is the time for decisions to be made. Do we vote in favor of the motion, against the motion, or abstain?"
 socintern.18.a:0 "Vote in favor."
 socintern.18.b:0 "Vote against."
 socintern.18.c:0 "Abstain from the decision."

 socintern.19.t:0 "The Non-Aggression Pact Passes"
 socintern.19.d:0 "The General Assembly has finished voting, and it seems that the General Assembly has decided to pass the motion. Now all members of the SocIntern shall have mutual non-aggression pacts between them, preventing them from going to war with each other. Some proponents of the motion claim that this is a key step towards a truly international revolution. While it is still far too early to claim or suggest such ideas, the proponents of the mutual non-aggression pact still have reason to celebrate. With the motion passed, the matter of the mutual non-aggression pact has been resolved, and the SocIntern can turn its attention to other matters."
 socintern.19.a:0 "The world at peace."

 socintern.20.t:0 "The Non-Aggression Pact Fails"
 socintern.20.d:0 "The General Assembly has finished voting, and it seems that the motion has failed. There shall be no mutual non-aggression pact between SocIntern nations, and the proposal will be shelved for now. This is not necessarily the end of such a proposal, and it may return in the future. However, for now the delegations must be content with the current vote's outcome, as the SocIntern turns its attention to other matters."
 socintern.20.a:0 "A blow to solidarity?"

 socintern.20.t:0 "The General Assembly's Recess"
 socintern.20.d:0 "The matter of the latest proposal has been concluded, and the decision finalized. Regardless of the outcome or the opinions of the delegations, there is nothing more to say on the matter.\n\nAs such, the General Assembly has gone into recess until the next proposal is put forth. The assembly has been adjourned, and the various delegations return to their respective embassies and governments to report the events of the meeting. They also return to discuss their plans for the future regarding the SocIntern, and the next assembly will likely be just as eventful as the last."
 socintern.20.a:0 "Noted."


 comecon.1.t:0 "Aid for Development"
 comecon.1.d:0 "When our comrades are in great struggle, it is upon us to come to their aid. The common people of [From.GetName], from the miners and soldiers to the bureaucrats and generals, are in a great struggle. The bourgeoisie of the world, from the black fascism of the Germans, to the decadent imperialism of the Japanese, to the capitalistic slavery that inhabits and infests the American spirit; all stand tall and oppress the worker. In their moral struggle against these corrupt powers, the siren song of nationalism and greed promising an escape from unideal circumstances, the [From.GetNameAdj] people called out for aid from the rest of our International.\n\nWe have spared no expense, providing resources beyond measure to our allies, most of all being our camaraderie. In this act, we have ensured that our comrades abroad are freed from their struggle, and that they can develop their paradise."
 comecon.1.a:0 "Building the world."
 
 comecon.2.t:0 "COMECON Aid Arrives"
 comecon.2.d:0 "Our comrades within the SocIntern, the COMECON, have decided to provide us with aid! Large supplies of currency, in reliable gold and silver, have crossed our borders and shores and into our stores, all thanks to our cooperation with our comrades across the globe. While this aid has been provided to us, and though we are very thankful, we must hold off on the celebrations. Before we can smile at the fortune of our government and people, we must decide what we shall dedicate our new resource to.\n\nWe can add it to ourLiquid Reserves, gaining significant financial boons, however this gain will be only in the short-term.\n\nWe can dedicate it to a variety of long term programs, which would grow our humble economy overtime.\n\nWe can cement our dedication to the socialistic promise, and distribute the wealth to the humble worker, which would greaten the equality of our society.\n\nUltimately, we must decide what to do with the funds, and we will..."
 comecon.2.a:0 "Deposit the money into our reserves."
 comecon.2.b:0 "Utilize it for direct economic growth."
 comecon.2.c:0 "Invest it to increase the standard of living."

 comecon.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Request for COMECON Aid"
 comecon.3.d:0 "A communique has reached us, from our comrades in [From.GetName]:\n\nComrades,\n\nThere are whispers of counter-revolution in the streets, whispers borne of the despair one feels when chained by struggle, like the chains of tyranny we once felt. There is often not enough food, not enough work, not enough for the common [From.GetNameAdj] worker to thrive. We have worked hard in maintaining and building our Revolution, but we must humbly call upon our Comrades abroad for aid. If we can build up our industry, our economy, our people, then we can ensure the prosperity of every [From.GetNameAdj].\n\n- On Behalf of the [From.GetNameAdj] People\n\nNow, we have our choice. Many within our government are in favour of aiding our fellow revolutionaries abroad, however some believe that our resources could be used better here. Ultimately, we must make a decision."
 comecon.3.a:0 "We would gladly provide."
 comecon.3.b:0 "We cannot do this at this time."

 comecon.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Aid Declined"
 comecon.4.d:0 "We have received a communique from our foreign comrades who we requested aid from:\n\n"Comrades,\n\nWhile your request for financial aid is very important, it is our deepest regret to inform you that we simply cannot spare room in the budget at the moment. With the people inside of our borders requiring food and industry themselves, our armies needing outfitting, our roads being paved; it is unfortunately impossible for us to alleviate your struggle in this time. Our commitment to our comrades abroad is as unwavering as the eternal spirit of the Humble Worker.\n\n- Your Brothers in the Global Revolution."\n\nIt seems that we will have to wait to receive the aid that we desire."
 comecon.4.a:0 "Better luck next time."

 comecon.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Aid Approved"
 comecon.5.d:0 "Our comrades within the SocIntern, the COMECON, have aided us as requested! Large supplies of currency, in reliable gold and silver, have crossed our borders and shores and into our stores, all thanks to our cooperation with our comrades across the globe.

 comecon.5.c:0 "Invest it to increase standard of living."

 comecon.6.t:0 "Funds for COMECON"
 comecon.6.d:0 "For the success of socialism and equality abroad, we have elected to put a portion of our budget towards the future prosperity of our comrades within the COMECON. These funds will be used for the economic development of our fellow socialistic nations, from construction and investment, to social aid packages that lift the Humble Worker out of poverty. If we need the financial support during a time of great economic crisis, or out of the simple need to fund development projects, we are able to withdraw funds. For now, though, we are presently depositing funds for our comrades across the world to use.\n\nNow that our humble donation to the fund has been agreed upon, the only question remains is the size of our contribution."
 comecon.6.a:0 "Deposit 1% of the budget."
 comecon.6.b:0 "Deposit 2.5% of the budget."
 comecon.6.c:0 "Deposit 5% of the budget."
 comecon.6.e:0 "Deposit 7.5% of the budget."

 comecon.7.t:0 "Funds from COMECON"
 comecon.7.d:0 "For the success of socialism and equality abroad, the COMECON has a Mutual Monetary Fund. These funds are used by those who are developing their nation for the good of their people. This can be simple infrastructure projects, to social aid programs. The decision of what to do with the funding is up to the withdrawing government, and ours has elected to harness some of the built-up financial power of the COMECON. Whatever we remove from the fund will aid us in our present projects, however there will be less to draw from for our future comrades. Of course, our present ambitions may require a larger amount of financial support. It is ultimately within our judgement, now.\n\nWith our withdrawal has been approved, the only question remains is how much we require."
 comecon.7.a:0 "Withdraw 10% of the fund."

These funds will be used by those who require the resources to keep the Revolution burning, and our contribution may be absolutely vital in the years to come. If we need the financial support, in the future, we will be able to withdraw a portion of the funding ourselves during our time of great need. Of course, only those who are waging war for the good of the Humble Worker may access the fund, to ensure the sanctity of its usage.\n\nNow that our humble donation to the fund has been agreed upon, the only question remains is the size of our contribution."

 comecon.9.d:0 "For the defense of socialism and equality abroad, the SocIntern has a Revolutionary Aid Fund. These funds are used by those who require the resources to keep the Revolution burning, and we fit the criteria required, considering the conflict we are now waging for the good of the Humble Worker. Whatever we remove from the fund will aid us in our present battles, however there will be less to draw from for our future comrades. Of course, our present struggle may justify a larger amount of financial support. It is ultimately within our judgement, now.\n\nWith our withdrawal has been approved, the only question remains is how much our struggle requires."

 comecon.10.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Investment in the COMECON Research Bureau"
 comecon.10.d:0 "The Fatal Flaw of the capitalist ideology, reduced to its basest element, is the inherent subsidization of greed within the hearts of men. This subsidization draws from the degenerative focus on competition, where only the "fittest" can survive. The common claim has been that competition drives forth innovation, and the success of American industry has been pointed to as proof of such. There is a new argument, though. This American technological prowess exists not because of competing corporations, searching to squeeze out every last dime of the humble worker's labour, but in spite of them.\n\nToday, we join something larger than petty, barbaric fighting over knowledge that could be shared. Today, we find that cooperation will bring us the international socialist future that all of us have dreamed of, by way of technology. Today, we join our comrades across the globe, and join the COMECON Scientific Bureau. Our cooperation is our strength, not our weakness, and the people shall be ascendant."

 comecon.11.d:0 "Blueprints, Experts, and Funds. All three have been sent to us by our Comrades abroad, and with them we can bolster our industrial capabilities. There are different ways that we can use the resources that we have been given, we must simply act on them. The most simple of ideas is creating a new facility somewhere within our nation for industrial production, the Blueprints and Funds being put towards the construction of a factory. On the other hand, we have the ability to learn more about productivity and efficiency, using the blueprints and these foreign experts as ways to teach more innovative methods to our domestic forces. A third option, as well, is that we may simply use the funds to massively produce more equipment for our ever-beating economy.\n\nThe choice remains, what shall we do?"
 comecon.11.a:0 "We can use this to jump-start our manufacturing."
 comecon.11.b:0 "Invest it in quality industrial equipment."
