 POLITICS_MALDIVES_MIKE_HOARE_DESC:0 "It is with some sort of humor that the Indian subcontinent, where Thomas Michael Hoare was born, has been the site of his greatest accomplishment in his long career of warfare. Born in Calcutta in 1919, Hoare joined the London Irish Rifles at 20, when the Second World War began. In his time as a soldier for the British, he fought in the unsuccessful Arakan Campaign, and then, ironically, against the Azad Hind in the early stages of the final Bengali Campaign before the British withdrew from India - and Hoare with them. He then served in the British Isles Campaign before they fell, and moved to South Africa, where he became a safari leader - as well as a soldier-for-hire.\n\nHoare found his way into Zentralafrika in the late 1950s, and performed multiple missions for the Reichskommissariat, including anti-partisan operations. During the South African War, he continued to serve Müller's forces, fighting against American forces just as he had done against partisans. After that was done, he roamed the world, serving no single man nor country. That is, until he received an offer from his old home: India.\n\nHoare's latest mission is far from standard. In typical fashion, he was put in charge of the force that would sieze the newly-independent Maldives for the Azad Hind Government. However, instead of taking off and leaving after his work was done, he would remain in a governmental role as leader of the Maldives. Few were surprised when Hoare was found to be in charge of the Indian troops - after all, the Azad Hind is known for its use of soldiers of fortune - but they were shocked to find him taking on a role of governance. Hoare's job description has changed, as the decision lies before him - shall he serve as an ally of the Maldivians and the Indians, or shall he show the inhabitants of his new realm why people call him Mad Mike Hoare?"

 maldives.6.t:0 "Enemy Approaching!"
 maldives.6.desc:0 "It seems our newfound independence is not welcomed by all, as we have received reports of Indian National Navy ships in the Bay of Bengal, on their way southwest - to the Maldives! They no doubt intend to seize our small country and to make it nothing but a glorified military base, from which to threaten Delhi from the south, as well as the east.\n\nWe have two options in defending our independence against the Free Indians; Firstly, we can merely tough it out alone, hoping that we are strong enough to repel the invaders. Secondly, we can turn to the Organization of Free Nations, offering to give over military bases - including the valuable archipelago of Diego Garcia - in turn for protection. This option, however, threatens our way of life, letting the Americans and Australians into our country, in a practice some politicians even go so far as to say would only be the first step in restoring our status as a British colony. At the end of the day, however, the choice is the President's alone - and the people of the Maldives can only pray he makes the right one."

 maldives.9.t:0 "The Maldives Cries For Help!
 maldives.9.desc:0 "After a successful independence referendum, the tiny island chain of the Maldives has found independence under the democratic government of Ibrahim M. Didi. However, the Azad Hind, more than happy to capitalize off of the Republic of India's distraction in Tamil Nadu, has sent the Indian National Navy on the move to the Maldives, in the hope of annexing this small island chain. If they are to succeed, it not only gives them an enormous strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean, but also allows them to funnel troops into the Deccan Peninsula from the Maldives, opening up another front to defend in the inevitable war between them and the Republic of India.\n\nThe two options on the table are rather simple: we either agree to support Maldivian independence against the Azad Hind, or don't. Doing so would give us the aforementioned strategic advantage in the Indian Ocean, with access to East Africa, Indonesia, and the Arabian Peninsula, as well as an ally in India. However, we are somewhat preoccupied with matters at home and in international conflicts, and there always exists the possibility that this could open up a dangerous conflict with the Azad Hind, and perhaps the Co-Prosperity Sphere as a whole. What shall we do?"
 maldives.9.a:0 "We must defend the Maldives!"

 maldives.10.t:0 "The OFN Backs Up the Maldives!"
 maldives.10.desc:0 "It seems that our fears have come true, as the Maldivian capitalists' squeals for help have not gone unanswered. The western pig-dogs have made their return to the subcontinent, but this time they are not British, but American. Already, they have begun construction of so-called "military bases" - in truth, only treaty ports to further be expanded upon. Even more cessions, such as the archipelago of Diego Garcia, have been promised by the Maldivians to the western invaders.\n\nOur liberation of the islands sits at a knife's edge, as naval force is no longer on the table. On one hand, we may continue to bring the island into our hands via use of PMCs under our control. This would be a good way of seizing the islands from below, rather than a direct invasion, but it would still bring us into conflict with the OFN. On the other hand, we could give up now, at the cost of prestige - but saving human life in the process."

 maldives.11.t:0 "Refugees From Tamil Nadu"
 maldives.11.desc:0 "As the Tamil Tigers continue their terror war on in the Deccan Peninsula, refugees from the area, as well as Ceylon, have begun to make their way across the world. Many have merely gone to other parts of India, but some have instead fled to other countries - such as the Maldives, where one group of refugees has arrived.\n\nThe arrival of refugees has triggered a debate in the government over what to do. Some, such as the more liberal parties, argue for the need to bring in the tired, the poor, and those fleeing from conflict. Other, more conservative groups say that this will destroy Maldivian culture, and that the Maldivians will be colonized by Tamils and Hindus. At the end of the day, however, and end must come to this bickering, and the government agrees to..."
