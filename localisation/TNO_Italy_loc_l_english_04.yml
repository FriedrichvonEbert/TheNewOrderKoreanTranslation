 ita_italian_hegemony:0 "Italian Hegemony"
 ita_italian_hegemony_desc:0 "Unlike other players on the world stage, we aren't satisfied with just "surviving". No! We shall rise above the mass of petty nations squabbling over the leftovers, and take part in the true banquet of the world powers! Of course, we are no fools, and wouldn't risk sending the entire world into a third war, not after what we have seen...\n\nStill, there are other ways Italy can exert her influence and, with careful planning, become the hegemon in Europe, especially since the Reich seems to be busy clawing itself apart... We shall send out our envoys, and weave a solid web of alliances with which to protect ourselves and our interests."
 
 ita_over_hungary:0 "Over Hungary"
 ita_over_hungary_desc:0 "Hungary is the textbook case of a country which overestimated its own strength, and made far more enemies than what it could take on at the same time. After greatly increasing its territory during the last war, thanks to German backing, as soon as the Reich was busy fighting for its collective survival against the Russians, the very same nations they abused - Romania, Serbia, Slovenia - took their sweet revenge, regaining all lost territories and then some.\n\nNow, what remains of the "pearl of the Danube" is a broken shell of a country, held together by fear and desperation. Still, one can find diamonds even in the rough, and the Hungarian people are proud, their traditions still solid: Hungary can still rise from its ashes, if helped a kind-hearted country they would be forever indebted to... Hmmm, what country could it be..."
 
 ita_lubiana_budapest_railway:0 "Lubiana-Budapest Railway"
 ita_lubiana_budapest_railway_desc:0 "If we want to have a constructive relationship with Hungary, we first have to bring our countries closer.\n\nLiterally.\n\nConnections between Italy and the Magyar nation are obsolete and inefficient: instead of small roads and Victorian-era locomotives, we shall build a modern railway between Budapest and Lubiana, connecting Hungary to our national rail system so that our trains can go all the way from Rome to the Pearl of the Danube without having to change carriage. Of course, we will ask for nothing in return. Nothing physical, at least..."
 
 ita_review_agricultural_trade_barriers:0 "Review Agricultural Trade Barriers"
 ita_review_agricultural_trade_barriers_desc:0 "Both Italy and the German Reich are very protectionist in food tariffs. This, coupled with Hungary being landlocked, and thus unable to export its products outside Europe, has strangled the Magyar agriculture: harvests from the fertile Danubian fields rot under the sun with no one to buy them, and the farmers despair as they lose everything they worked so hard for.\n\nIf we want to make a good impression on the Hungarian people even more than its government, we can lessen the trade barriers we have put on agricultural products, especially corn and meat: with a bit of breathing space, the economy should start recovering. It would be such a pity if we were to suddenly reinstate the barriers, but we are sure that such an eventuality can be avoided... with the right insurances."
 
 ita_our_protective_wing:0 "Our Protective Wing"
 ita_our_protective_wing_desc:0 "Hungary is weak, and in desperate need of protection. With a weak government, and an even weaker army and police force, forces within the country agitate, trying to rip the nation apart at the seams: the German nationals wish to secede and join the Reich, while the liberals prepare their forces for a coup against the legitimate government.\n\nTo a country in such a pitiful state, it would be mercy to extend our protective wing to them: a declaration of support from our minister of foreign affairs, a batch of military supplies for the army and the police, and - best of all - a detachment of the SIM to uncover and remove all threats to the central power. Of course, it's not as if we expect anything for this selfless act of generosity..."
 
 ita_review_the_italo_magyar_friendship_treaty:0 "Review the Italo-Magyar Friendship Treaty"
 ita_review_the_italo_magyar_friendship_treaty_desc:0 "Italy and Hungary have been very close in the past: from the Italo-Magyar Friendship Treaty of 1927, to the Rome Protocols of 1934, our two countries always cooperated closely. During the war, our soldiers fought side by side in Russia against the communist beast, but after the victory, when the Axis fell apart, Hungary chose to remain by Germany's side.\n\nThe alliance has withered with time, but it has not died yet. It's time to breathe new life into the Friendship Treaty, and let our nations become close once more! Hungary will surely see the good in our proposal: after all, it's not as if they have a choice..."
 
 ita_invest_in_MAVAG:0 "Invest in MAVAG"
 ita_invest_in_MAVAG_desc:0 "The MAVAG, or "Hungarian Royal State Railroads' Machine Factory", is a state-run company that produces transport vehicles ranging from locomotives to cars and trucks. Today it is famous for being one of the last big factories still active in Hungary, after all other industries have gone bankrupt: should it fall too, it would be the final nail on the Magyar economy.\n\nThat is, if we don't invest into it. A couple million liras is nothing for the IRI's budget, but it should be enough to save the company from its creditors and give a small but powerful boost to the entire country's productive sector. Of course, it will take much more than that before the Hungarian economy is fixed. The coffin is still there, the main difference is that now we are the ones holding both nails and hammer..."
 
 ita_an_outlet_for_hungarian_goods:0 "An Outlet for Hungarian Goods"
 ita_an_outlet_for_hungarian_goods_desc:0 "With Hungary's agriculture back on track, and its industry on the road towards recovery, the small nation's market will soon be flooded with goods it has no hope to buy or sell. In Italy and the countries within our sphere, coincidentally, there are tens of millions of potential customers who will surely appreciate the finest products of Magyar ingenuity!\n\nOf course, integrating Hungary's trade so deeply with ours has a very small, almost negligible consequence: should their government selfishly decide to turn their back on us again, trade between our countries would end, and with it, the entire Hungarian economy, but after all, why would they ever want to leave..."
 
 ITA_hungarian_trade:0 "Italo-Hungarian Trade"
 ITA_hungarian_trade_desc:0 "As part of our noble efforts to integrate our European sphere of influence, it would no doubt benefit our nation to revive and strengthen trade between Italy and Hungary. While our merchants are uncertain about the feasibility of this venture -- perhaps disturbed by Hungary's instability and persistent poverty -- a few subsidies and subtle hints about state contract opportunities will soon set them right.\n\nAs in the days of the Roman Empire, the trade of Europe will flow freely along the great roads of the continent. The trucks and trains will be loaded to the brim, and bring the best of Italian goods to our neighbor to the North. As they do, they will also deliver the prosperity of our great nation, and loyalty to our government and sphere."
 
 ita_new_weapon_shipments:0 "New Weapon Shipments"
 ita_new_weapon_shipments_desc:0 "Low funds for research and development, and the collapse of the country's armament industry has left the Royal Hungarian Army in a sorry state. Divisions are undermanned and underarms, with most soldiers being given barely their service rifle and uniform: automatic and squad weapons such as SMG, HMG and mortars are a luxury reserved for the (few) elite troops, and the artillery is few and obsolete, often dating back to before the war! It is evident that, in such a state, it would take but an armoured division for Hungary to capitulate.\n\nLucky for them, they have a guardian angel always looking for them: Italy shall generously provide modern equipment to the Magyar army, and the training necessary to use it! However, weapons need ammo to work properly, and of course, munitions supply will be the topic of a long discussion. A long and profitable discussion..."
 
 ita_review_semmering_agreements:0 "Review the Semmering Agreements"
 ita_review_semmering_agreements_desc:0 "Stipulated in 1931, the Semmering Agreements were an effort to establish a common economic area between Italy, Austria and Hungary to both increase trade and industry, and - though less evident - establish a united front against potential German aggression. The Agreements ended the same way as the Rome Protocols after the Anschluss of Austria, and our policy towards Germany changed dramatically.\n\nNow that the Reich is once again our rival in Europe, we shall review the Simmering Agreements, further increasing the economic cooperation between our countries! How sad would it be if Hungary refused, and we were forced to call back all our investments at the same time..."
 
 ita_joint_credit_institutions:0 "Joint Credit Institutions"
 ita_joint_credit_institutions_desc:0 "Banks are the cornerstone of modern economies. With their ingent cash reserves, they can grant loans to those with great ideas, but not enough resources to turn them into reality. The Hungarian banking sector collapsed, together with the rest of the economy, after the German crash in the 50s, and now the government doesn't have the means to build a new one.\n\nWhat a coincidence that the IRI has expressed the intention of investing in the underdeveloped regions of the Balkans! We shall give our companies the green light, and establish new joint-ventures between our banks and the surviving Hungarian ones, breathing live anew into the Magyar economy. Guess who owns 51% of all shares..."
 
 ita_the_regency_question:0 "The Regency Question"
 ita_the_regency_question_desc:0 "While the relationship between the Blocci Nazionale and the Italian Monarchy is complicated to say the least, our attitude to the Hungarian Regency need not be the same. The Hungarian government has long been divided between hardline fascists, no doubt respectable in their nationalist fervor but concerningly close to the Hunnic enemy, and the nation's royal remnants.\n\nAs our influence in Hungary grows by the day, we must soon decide how to advise our client state on this issue. Allowing Hungary to keep the monarchy might win us some more friends among the country's upper crust, but might also give them a symbol to rally behind should our relations ever sour."
 
 blocchidiplo.1.t:0 "Italian Hegemony"
 blocchidiplo.1.d:0 "For ten thousand years Europe has been the center of the world. The birthplace of civilization, the home of philosophy, art, and culture. And for ten thousand years, Rome has been the center of Europe.\n\nIt was Rome that gave birth to an empire that define the continent for centuries to come, it was Rome that brought the uncivilized tribes to modernity. Rome was the birthplace of the renaissance, the center of christianity, the eternal city and the birthplace of untold millions. As Rome is the capital of Italy, likewise Italy is the manifestation of all that Rome has accomplished in the world. For centuries the Italian people were subjugated and divided, having fallen prey to false ideologies and scheming neighbors. However, its people remained proud, and dreamed that they would one day restore their nation to glory.\n\nThe Fascist revolution was the first step towards that destiny, the reforms of Ciano the second. Now it is time to complete this grand project, and remind the continent of Rome's power.\n\nFrom the Dardanelles to Gibraltar, from the sands of the Sahara to the plains of the East, we will spread the light of civilization. Wherever it is found, degeneracy and madness will be driven back to their hovels. We will defeat the perfidious hun, cowardly socialists, and all others who stand in our way.\n\nThe world will know the strength of the Italian nation and its people, and Rome will remain its center for ten thousand more years."
 blocchidiplo.1.a:0 "Italy is the greatest!"
 
 blocchidiplo.2.t:0 "Over Hungary"
 blocchidiplo.2.d:0 "Poor Hungary. So far from God, and so close to Germany...\n\nThe years since the end of the war have not been kind to Hungary. Whilst Hungary fought alongside us, and the Germans, during the war, soon after the victory the cracks started to appear. When the Italo-German split happened and the Axis fell apart, Hungary decided to remain aligned with Germany.\n\nPerhaps this was the wrong choice, as afterwards, Hungary soon found itself in conflict with another former ally, Romania. This conflict did not end in Hungary's favor, and its territory was dismembered. Worse yet, Germany expelled it from the Unity-Pakt for its insolence, dealing a death knell to both the country's economy and its standing in the world.\n\nTo say that Hungary today is in dire straits would be a massive understatement. With the economy in utter ruin, the regent's hold on power threatened by pro-democracy factions and the German-Hungarian Volksbund alike, Hungary today is the very definition of a failed state.\n\nHowever, their pain may yet be our gain. With the economy in complete shambles and the country being a pariah amongst its rapacious neighbors, there is strong resentment towards both the influential German minority in the country, and the nation-state of Germany for its role in Hungary's predicament.\n\nIn other words, the country is fertile ground for Italian influence..."
 blocchidiplo.2.a:0 "Italy is the greatest!"
 
 blocchidiplo.3.t:0 "Italy Proposes New Railway"
 blocchidiplo.3.d:0 "The Italians have come to us with a proposition.\n\nThey want to construct a new railway, leading from Lubiana to Budapest. They claim that this will increase trade and travel between the two cities, leading to an economic boon for all involved. A win-win scenario, or so they say.\n\nOf course, there's probably more to it than the Italians are saying. Increased trade will undoubtedly lead to our economy becoming further intertwined with Italy's, for good or for ill. To say nothing of the fact that the actual railway will most likely be constructed and operated by Italian companies... Do those concerns outweigh the benefits?\n\nShould we accept?"
 blocchidiplo.3.a:0 "We accept! Let the construction commence!"
 blocchidiplo.4.b:0 "We refuse!"
 
 blocchidiplo.4.t:0 "Hungary Agrees to Railway"
 blocchidiplo.4.d:0 "The Hungarians have wisely agreed to the new railway from Lubiana to Budapest! Now we can get to work constructing it and further link our economies together! Everybody wins! Soon, the cities of Rome and Budapest will be sisters, despite their distance, and the peoples of Italy and Hungary brothers.\n\nWith this new link to serve as the main artery of our great alliance, we can rest easy knowing that our northern flank is secure for the foreseeable future. Unyielding in its loyalty to those who serve it well, the Italian sphere shall always defend our clients. In this way we will protect their prosperity, and of course, our own."
 blocchidiplo.4.a:0 "Great!"
 
 blocchidiplo.5.t:0 "Hungary Refuses Railway"
 blocchidiplo.5.d:0 "Bad news! The Hungarians have refused our generous offer of the Lubiana-Budapest railway!" Why their government, thus far amenable to our influence has proceeded with such a damaging and foolhardy course of action, we can only guess. Most likely, their leadership has fallen under the influence of the psychotic German beast, or naive nationalists who think that they can succeed without our protection.\n\nWhatever the case, this is certainly a blow to relations between our nations. Perhaps it's time to consider more direct action to insure that our interests in Hungary are secure. After all, just as any good parent should not hesitate to discipline disobedient children, we must make sure that the members of our sphere keep heed of their own best interests, and ours of course."
 blocchidiplo.5.a:0 "Blast!"
 
 blocchidiplo.6.t:0 "Italy Proposes Reduced Trade Barriers"
 blocchidiplo.6.d:0 "It appears the Italians have come to us with an offer.\n\nIn the interests of free trade and for the benefit of both our economies, they have proposed reduced tariffs and trade barriers on Hungarian agricultural products. In other words, they want to make it easier for our farmers to sell their produce in Italy.\n\nThis certainly seems like a good deal, and our strong agricultural sector would undoubtedly benefit tremendously. But, as always, there may be more to this deal than meets the eye. This would cause our economies to become further intertwined, for better or for worse. It would also make us more dependent on the whims of the Italian market.\n\nIs the potential economic benefit worth accepting? Or should we decline?"
 blocchidiplo.6.a:0 "Free trade will benefit us both. We accept!"
 blocchidiplo.6.b:0 "We refuse!"
 
 blocchidiplo.7.t:0 "Hungary Agrees to New Trade Barriers"
 blocchidiplo.7.d:0 "Good news! Hungary has wisely agreed to our generous offer to reduce trade barriers for Hungarian agricultural products! This will benefit Hungary, and more importantly, it will benefit us! A true win-win for all involved!"
 blocchidiplo.7.a:0 "Great!"
 
 blocchidiplo.8.t:0 "Hungary Refuses New Trade Barriers"
 blocchidiplo.8.d:0 "Bad news! For whatever reason, the Hungarians have foolishly declined our generous offer to reduce trade barriers for Hungarian agriculture!"
 blocchidiplo.8.a:0 "Their loss!"
 
 blocchidiplo.9.t:0 "Italy Offers Protection"
 blocchidiplo.9.d:0 "The Italians have approached us with an offer.\n\nItaly has offered to issue a guarantee of our borders. Meaning that, should we be threatened by an aggressor, Italy would defend us and our territorial integrity.\n\nThis sounds like a pretty good deal, especially with the chaos engulfing both Europe and the world. In these turbulent times, it is good to have a strong protector.\n\nOf course, this would also further align us with Italy, and could risk the ire of their northern enemy, the Germans. After all, they would not take kindly to Italy gaining a foothold on their doorstep...\n\nSome argue that it would also erode Hungarian sovereignty by making us dependent on Italy.\n\nBut perhaps it's worth it, for the sake of self-preservation?"
 blocchidiplo.9.a:0 "We accept. In this chaotic world, we need a strong protector."
 blocchidiplo.9.b:0 "We refuse! We do not need Italian protection!"
 
 blocchidiplo.10.t:0 "Hungary Accepts Our Protection"
 blocchidiplo.10.d:0 "Good news! The Hungarians have wisely decided to accept our offer of protection! This will further align them with the Italosphere, and increase our influence in Hungary!"
 blocchidiplo.10.a:0 "Great!"
 
 blocchidiplo.11.t:0 "Hungary Refuses Our Protection"
 blocchidiplo.11.d:0 "Bad news! The foolish Hungarians have declined our most generous offer of protection! Their short-sightedness knows no bounds! Well, when the Germans come knocking on their door, they can't say that we didn't try to help them!"
 blocchidiplo.11.a:0 "In the future they will rue this day!"
 
 blocchidiplo.12.t:0 "Italo-Magyar Friendship Treaty"
 blocchidiplo.12.d:0 "The Italians have come to us yet again with an offer. This time, they are offering a "Friendship Treaty", saying that they wish to solidify and strengthen the once-strong ties between our countries..\n\nA more accurate term for this would be a "non-aggression pact." In other words, Italy will not start any conflict with us, and neither will we with them. Whilst not a formal alliance, it would definitely be a sign of closer ties with Italy. Geopolitical ties, at that, as opposed to simply economic ties. The Germans would undoubtedly not take kindly to this, however...\n\nIs it worth it?"
 blocchidiplo.12.a:0 "We accept the Friendship Treaty!"
 blocchidiplo.13.b:0 "We cannot risk provoking the Germans..."
 
 blocchidiplo.13.t:0 "Hungary Accepts Friendship Treaty"
 blocchidiplo.13.d:0 "Good news! The Hungarians have wisely accepted our most generous offer of a friendship treaty! This will solidify and strengthen the ties between our two countries, and further draw Hungary out of the German sphere and into the Italosphere!"
 blocchidiplo.13.a:0 "To a future of friendship!"
 
 blocchidiplo.14.t:0 "Hungary Refuses Friendship Treaty"
 blocchidiplo.14.d:0 "Bad news! The Hungarians have turned down our most generous offer of a friendship treaty between our countries! Their reasoning is that they do not want to risk provoking the Germans."
 blocchidiplo.14.a:0 "Blast!"
 
 blocchidiplo.15.t:0 "Italy Offers to Invest in MAVAG"
 blocchidiplo.15.d:0 "While our history with the Italians is certainly...mixed, we can't deny that they've got plenty of money and not enough (apparently) to spend it on. Although they have a deplorable tendency to interfere with other nations internal affairs, they at least prefer to do it with gold rather than lead. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that the nationalist Blocci Nazionale led government has offered to massively increase their investment in MAVAG, our state-run railway company.\n\nThe potential benefits of this investment cannot be overstated, but neither can its risks. Our government maintains only tenuous control over Hungary's hinterlands, and with the financial boost the Italians offer, we could integrate the countryside with a modern rail system, and help to bring our nation into the future. On the other hand, this could be the foot in the door of the "heirs of Mussolini" desire to eventually reduce our nation to nothing more than a Roman puppet. One way or another, we should have a reply for the Italians soon, lest they think us indecisive."
 blocchidiplo.15.a:0 "Accept"
 blocchidiplo.15.b:0 "Refuse"
 
 blocchidiplo.16.t:0 "Hungary Allows Investment"
 blocchidiplo.16.d:0 "Excellent news from Hungary! It seems that the government there saw the light, and has intelligently agreed to allow us to invest in the state-held railway corporation, MAVAG. This is an excellent day for both our peoples. Italy receives enhanced infrastructure in an important trading partner, and a worthwhile long-term investment, while Hungary receives the benefits of a modern transportation system, and a powerful ally in a dangerous region.\n\nOf course, this is also an opportunity for our nation to grow ever stronger within our rightful Mediterannian sphere. Once tenuous, our dominance over the region will only grow stronger, and soon we will be a power equal to the world's greatest nations."
 blocchidiplo.16.a:0 "Acceptance by an ally"
 
 blocchidiplo.17.t:0 "Hungary Refuses Investment"
 blocchidiplo.17.d:0 "Terrible news from Hungary! It seems that the government there has listened to its false friends over our sage advice, and refused to allow us to invest in the state-held railway corporation, MAVAG. While the Hungarian refusal was supremely polite, and described at great length that nation's continuous respect for their "great Italian ally", we cannot be cozened with such tricks. This is an insult, plain and simple.\n\nAlthough certainly a setback, this isn't the end of our campaign to expand our influence North. One way or another, the Hungarians will see reason, and join their Italian brothers in a glorious mediterranian union. They just don't seem to know it yet."
 blocchidiplo.17.a:0 "Refusal by refuce"
 
 blocchidiplo.18.t:0 "Italy Wants Hungarian Goods"
 blocchidiplo.18.d:0 "The Italians have once again come to us with an offer.\n\nThis time they want to make it easier for us to sell Hungarian products in Italy, by lowering tariffs on Hungarian goods entering the country. This will lead to increased sales of Hungarian goods in Italy, and thus, more money for Hungary!\n\nOf course, there are some who claim the Italians have ulterior motives, as accepting would undoubtedly tie our economy further to that of the Italosphere. We must ask ourselves if that is worth the increased revenue from sales in Italy."
 blocchidiplo.18.a:0 "Free trade will benefit us both. We accept!"
 blocchidiplo.18.b:0 "We refuse!"
 
 blocchidiplo.19.t:0 "Hungary Accepts Lower Tariffs"
 blocchidiplo.19.d:0 "Good news! The Hungarians have wisely decided to accept our most generous offer of lower tariffs! They will make more money as Hungarian goods flow into Italy, and we will tie their economy further into that of the Italosphere! A true win-win for all involved!"
 blocchidiplo.19.a:0 "Free trade is the route to prosperity for all!"
 
 blocchidiplo.20.t:0 "Hungary Refuses Lower Tariffs"
 blocchidiplo.20.d:0 "Bad news! For whatever shortsighted reason, the Hungarians have foolishly declined our most generous offer of lower tariffs on Hungarian goods! Whist this is a setback for our plans, it will undoubtedly be an even bigger setback for them and their already-shambolic economy! Someday they shall wish they accepted!"
 blocchidiplo.20.a:0 "Their loss!"
 
 blocchidiplo.21.t:0 "Italy Offers Weapon Shipments"
 blocchidiplo.21.d:0 "Italy has come to us, this time with an arms deal. They are offering to sell us Italian arms at a great discount.\n\nConsidering the woeful state of our military, this could be a great boon to us. Our military's equipment, after all, is either lacking, obsolete, or both. And in today's chaotic, dangerous world, it is imperative that our military is as strong as it can possibly be.\n\nOf course, this will further increase Italian influence in our country, and risks making us dependant on Italian arms to defend ourselves. Some argue that would be a threat to our sovereignty.\n\nShall we accept the deal?"
 blocchidiplo.21.a:0 "We need to modernize our military. We accept!"
 blocchidiplo.21.b:0 "We do not need Italian arms."
 
 blocchidiplo.22.t:0 "Hungary Accepts Weapon Shipments"
 blocchidiplo.22.d:0 "Good news! The Hungarians have wisely decided to accept our arms deal! This will be a great bargain for them, as they will now get fine Italian weapons for great prices. More importantly, it will be beneficial to us, as not only will we make some money off this, but this will further draw Hungary into the Italosphere!"
 blocchidiplo.22.a:0 "Great!"
 
 blocchidiplo.23.t:0 "Hungary Refuses Weapon Shipments"
 blocchidiplo.23.d:0 "Bad news! The foolish Hungarians have decided to decline our most generous offer of an arms deal! An irritating setback for our plans for Hungary, to be sure. It will, however, undoubtedly be an even bigger setback for them whenever they're invaded again! They'll wish they had Italian arms then!"
 blocchidiplo.23.a:0 "Their loss!"
 
 blocchidiplo.24.t:0 "Italy Proposes New Semmering Agreements"
 blocchidiplo.24.d:0 "First it was minor. A little rail investment here, a trade investment there, nothing to be worried about. Now, our Italian "ally" has become so daring as to propose a new "Semmering Agreement" that would all but reduce our nation into an economic client state. While there may certainly be benefits of drawing ever closer to Italy's abundant natural resources and powerful military, we risk losing our essential liberties for only a little temporary security.\n\nOn the other hand, dare we refuse. The Italians have cultivated powerful friends in our government, and far outclass us in military strength and international connections. We have long faced a narrow ledge with an abyss on either side, and it appears that we have run out of walking space. One way or another, we must now take the plunge, and hope that our nation emerges intact."
 blocchidiplo.24.a:0 "Accept"
 blocchidiplo.24.b:0 "Refuse"
 
 blocchidiplo.25.t:0 "Hungary Accepts"
 blocchidiplo.25.d:0 "Superb news. It seems that our Hungarian friends have seen the light, and intelligently consented to our new proposed New Semmering Agreements. This will give us increased weight within Hungarian mercantile circles, and give preference to Italian goods at every level.\n\nIt seems that despite the obvious loss of sovereignty accompanying this agreement, the Hungarians wisely understand that their nation has no future on its own. Afterall, they are not Hungarians as Hungarians, but rather members of a greater and glorious Mediterannian history. It seems we have succeeded in reminding them of this history, and of the strength it holds for the future."
 blocchidiplo.25.a:0 "Great!"
 
 blocchidiplo.26.t:0 "Hungary Refuses"
 blocchidiplo.26.d:0 "Bad news! The Hungarians have foolishly rejected our "Semmering Agreement"! They apparently want to cling to their delusions of "maintaining their sovereignty", rather than accepting the reality that Hungary, nestled between Italy and Germany, cannot stand on its own.\n\nThis will be a setback to our plans for Hungary. We will have to find another way to tie their economy to the Italosphere, through coercion or otherwise..."
 blocchidiplo.26.a:0 "Blast!"
 
 blocchidiplo.27.t:0 "Italy Proposes Joint Credit Institutions"
 blocchidiplo.27.d:0 "Our banks have long reflected the sorrowful state of our economy. That is, they are insolvent, failing, and barely avoiding collapsing entirely, somehow. However, this cannot last forever. Sooner or later, something will give.\n\nUnless, of course, the Italians step in.\n\nThe Italians have approached us with a deal. Being far wealthier than us, they have proposed providing our failing banks with a vast amount of credit, in effect propping them up and preventing the whole house of cards from caving in.\n\nBut, of course, there's a catch. Nothing in life is free, after all. In exchange for propping up our failing banks, the Italians are asking for a controlling share of the banks in exchange. In essence, they are asking us to relinquish control over our own banks over to them, in return for their financial support in preventing their collapse.\n\nEssentially selling our banks to the Italians would be a grave national humiliation and would further erode our sovereignty. But perhaps it is the only way to preserve them at all... "
 blocchidiplo.27.a:0 "We have no choice. We accept."
 blocchidiplo.28.b:0 "Hungary's banks belong to Hungary alone! We refuse!"
 
 blocchidiplo.28.t:0 "Hungary Accepts"
 blocchidiplo.28.d:0 "Good news! The Hungarians have wisely decided to accept our most generous offer of a rescue package for the failing Hungarian banks! Italian credit shall start flowing into Hungary, and shall revitalize these failing banks, and prevent what remains of Hungary's financial system from completely collapsing.\n\nOf course, we scratch their back, they scratch ours. They have, in return, agreed to give us a controlling share of their banks as part of the bailout. This will further entrench our control of the Hungarian economy and solidify their place in the Italosphere."
 blocchidiplo.28.a:0 "A win for everyone, and us especially!"
 
 blocchidiplo.29.t:0 "Hungary Refuses"
 blocchidiplo.29.d:0 "Bad news! The foolish Hungarians, in their hubris, have refused our most generous offer of credit for the failing Hungarian banks!\n\nHow they plan to prevent their banks from collapsing is beyond us, considering the dismal state of the overall Hungarian economy. But that is not our problem. When the Hungarian banks end up collapsing entirely, we shall be laughing!"
 blocchidiplo.29.a:0 "Their loss!"
 
 blocchidiplo.30.t:0 "A New Regent"
 blocchidiplo.30.d:0 "There has been a significant escalation in Italian efforts to influence our country. Istvan Horthy, son of the late Regent Miklos, has gathered enough support around him to carry off a palace coup and replace Bela Imragy as Regent. Istvan is not merely a foreign puppet. A moderate, competent man, he enjoys support among key people in our government and the general public. On the other hand, few doubt Istvan would repay the Italians' kindness once in power.\n\nRegent Bela has denounced an effort to replace the legitimate Hungarian Leader with a 'marionette imported from Rome'. His supporters have rallied, setting aside their own squabbles to preserve themselves.\n\nAs a silent and bloodless battle is waged, the slightest effort will tip the balance..."
 blocchidiplo.30.a:0 "Istvan prevails and becomes Regent!"
 blocchidiplo.30.b:0 "Bela defeats the coup and remains Regent!"
 
 blocchidiplo.31.t:0 "Our Candidate For Regent Won"

Italy and their puppet, the French State, have issued a statement in which they denounce the German language as inferior to Romance languages in every way. In a detailed announcement, written by so-called 'linguistics experts' and endorsed by the two governments, the German language is described as "crass, generally incoherent, and essentially a bastard dialect". It goes on to outline the inferiority of our contributions to literature, and concludes with a footnote discouraging "the teaching of German within our territories, unless this is to draw out the deficiencies of Germanic in comparison with Latin-derived languages".\n\nOur foremost cultural eminences agree that the statement is a grave insult. Not that this was difficult to elicit."

This is a moment to savor, as our agents report in that we at last have cemented our influence over the French nation.\n\nWe are brother nations. Although we have not always gotten along in the past, we share a common history and a common purpose. One of us was humbled by the Second World War, the other was launched by it into the ranks of the great powers. One of us was humiliated by the Burgundian monster, the other remains the only bulwark between it and the mediterannian. In Himmler's scourge and his crumbling Hunnic neighbor to the east, we share common foes. Against these monsters we shall build a new pact, to rosound through the ages!"

 ita_the_pride_of_italy_desc:0 "Italy is a modern nation, a democratic nation, and one possessed of proper patriotic pride. The BN's victory in our country's first democratic election has proven our people's martial spirit, and their commitment to an Italy that stands shoulder to shoulder with the great powers of the world, and faces them as an equal.\nBut to do this, we must first have a military worthy of a great nation. Thankfully, with just a few small improvements, the Regio Escrito will serve to take our national spirit into the future. Having performed admirably in the Second World War, and since battle-hardened by our long conflicts to maintain our grip on the Italosphere, Italy's military is truly the pride of the fatherland."
 
 ita_professionalism_is_key:0 "Professionalism Is Key"
 ita_professionalism_is_key_desc:0 "Although the consensus within the BN is that the Fascist era was (mostly) a markedly positive experience for the nation as a whole, it must be admitted that it brought with it a minor decline in the professionalism of the Regio Escrito. The PNF much preferred to focus on strengthening and expanding the MSVN over the questionably loyal military, and often maintained its grip on its monopoly of force via less savory economic means.\n\nHowever, just as great Ciano brought the Italian state into the post-war era, we shall continue his legacy by bringing Italy and its army into the future. No longer will soldiers lounge indolently around their barracks, no longer will they bedeck themselves in jewelry stolen from foreign lands. Italy's new military will be well equipped, well clothed, and the envy of nations the world over."

With a gun, a head full of propaganda, and a little encouragement, even a peasant scooped from the fields of Milan a couple weeks earlier could serve admirably in any of our frontlines across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nUnfortunately, it's a different world now. The conflicts of the modern, require a flexible, mobile, well-trained infantry capable of maintaining order and squashing partisans in equal measure. In order to make sure that Italy is prepared for this reality, our government has ordered a military-wide increase in training standards. Next time the enemies of Italy dare to challenge our supremacy, they will be faced not with the corrupt inefficient conscript army of old, but a fully operational modern military force."
 
 ita_assessment_and_testing:0 "Assessment and Testing"
 ita_assessment_and_testing_desc:0 "To make sure that Italy's military is prepared for whatever military engagements are required, our government has begun a program of unannounced and carefully calibrated inspections and testing. We will see to it that every gun is assembled in exactly the correct manner, that every soldier salutes exactly as instructed in the military guidebook, and every button on every uniform is perfectly matched to regulation.\n\nThe officers may grumble at this intrusion on their authority, the rank and file might make jokes about half-trained government bureaucrats, but in the end, this program will only benefit our nation and its soldiers. Naturally, if all of those inspected have nothing to hide, then they have nothing whatsoever to fear."
 
 ita_find_the_motivated:0 "Find the Motivated"
 ita_find_the_motivated_desc:0 "Although Italy's army is by no means small, and the sphere of nations in which it serves vast, our nation has struggled to find proper recruits to replace those who are killed or wounded serving their country. More particularly, we're struggling to find volunteers who see military service as a sacred duty, and not just a means to make a quick buck or an outlet for vicious desires.\n\nRectifying this issue won't be easy -- the lines at military kiosks grow ever shorter, and the number of body bags returning from the colonies has a tendency to dissuade even the most fervent of recruits. However, with a wide-scale propaganda campaign, we have no doubt there'll be more soldiers than uniforms to clothe them or guns to arm them with in no time! Which might be another problem we need to address."

In order to transform the Regio Escrito into a military truly worthy of Rome, we must find those who are truly possessed of a fighting spirit, and meet rigorous requirements for mental and physical fitness before hand. They will not be easy to find, but within crooked alleyways and ramshackle hovels, we will find them nonetheless, these sons of the New Italy, our diamonds in the rough."

Once more one hears the national anthem sung not just on national festivals, but every day. Once more the streets are festooned with the tricolor, and buildings with the portraits of the three heroes, Mussolini, Ciano, and Almirante.\n\nHowever admirable, this patriotic zeitgeist does us no good unless we make use of it. Our government will begin a program of promotion for the military, especially the recently expanded special departments. The airwaves, radios, and billboards will be blanketed with the sounds and sights of brave young men in uniform, valiantly defending their homeland. Naturally we will make an equal effort to prevent those scum-like journalists who seem to have no other purpose than to denigrate their nation producing any more of their accursed "investigative journalism" and "award winning" pictures of body bags."
 
 ita_a_special_force:0 "A Special Force"
 ita_a_special_force_desc:0 "The Italian military grows more modern by the day. What was once a poorly motivated army of conscripts is now a truly professional fighting force, which can stand equal in equipment (if unfortunately not in size) with the greatest nations of the world.\n\nAs the next step in this program, our government has launched an initiative to create a "special forces" unit, made only of the best and brightest culled from elsewhere in the military. While the commanders of those units complained bitterly, we don't need them. What we need is an army that can fight the conflicts across the Balkans at the same time, an army that can win the battle and the people alike, an army worthy of Italy."

But although the American, German, and Japanese historians might scoff even at the world of brave Balbo or the brave fanaticism of the MSVN, even they can't help but acknowledge the incomparable might of the Adra.\n\nOfficially the Royal Air Force Brave Destroyers, the ADRA are a force that rules the ground and skies alike, bringing death and destruction to all of Italy's foes. With the ADRA on the field, no enemy bridge was left standing, no airfield intact. Though the force has faded somewhat in the years since the war, we will revive it once more, to strike fear into the hearts of our enemies."

Just as Hannibal lost half his army (and all his elephants save for one) trying to cross our ancient mountains, even the most advanced panzer will concede before its icy peaks and steep ravines! Mountain warfare provides unique challenges and opportunity, and it's the only situation where infantry still holds the upper hand: with no armoured forces, only a fraction of air support, and only light artillery - often still horse-mounted since not even trucks can climb such inclination - capable of providing any help, it's a priority that we train our mountain troops to the highest degree.\n\nLuckily, our Alpini are among the best mountain infantry in the world! Tested in fire and blood, on the Alps during the First World war, and in icy Russia during the Second, they still serve with pride and loyalty. With an increase in funding, we will make sure that they are one step ahead of our enemies: all will fear the Black Feathers!"

From the Iberian Peninsula to Crimea and Egypt, the Regia Marina can easily support amphibious landings across our waters, but these are extremely dangerous operations, with our men exposed to enemy fire until they reach safe positions on land: despite our navy's support, hundreds, if not thousands of men can die before even being able to see their enemy's face!\n\nAs such, we need to grant proper funding and training to our frogmen: with modern protected boats and amphibious vehicles, they will suffer far less casualties in the landing phase, and with superior training and personal weaponry, they'll be able to quickly overwhelm the enemy, granting us a swift victory, and fewer names to inscribe on monuments.

Balbo will surely be proud of us!"

No! The Regio Esercito must be capable of deploying on any ground, without being impeded by terrain difficulties or the weather conditions, and still be able to fight effectively, coordinating with all ground, air and naval forces present on site.\n\nBy developing sturdy, effective and adaptable equipment, further improving the training regime and including local guides and experts in our larger units, we'll make sure to achieve the highest possible result, no matter the circumstances."

Under heavy pressure, we were forced to convert two civilian cruisers into our first carriers, the Aquila and the Sparviero: though the two ships still serve the Regia Marina with honour, it's evident that we need "proper" carriers if we want to face the other world powers on the same level.\n\nOf course, we will need suitable carrier planes, from fighters to naval bombers and close air support, to maximise the efficiency of our sea air support."

In battle, they also provide a mobile shield around the more powerful, but cumbersome, capital ships, preventing enemy destroyers from delivering their payload, and fending off enemy aircraft with powerful dual-purpose AA batteries.\n\nAs the power of air forces increase, it's vital, now more than ever before, that our destroyers follow the latest improvements in design and armaments, to protect our fleet from any threat, and strike swiftly and lethally against any ship so foolish to let them close in!"

Thanks to these foolish doctrines, rewards and promotions are based almost entirely on patronage and seniority rather than performance. This results in an airforce of old men and toadies, more interested in faking battle reports than actually fighting.\n\nWe will slash through these outdated ideas with vim and vigor, and replace them with a system of carefully calibrated rewards that assures that new ideas are actually incorporated into the Airforce, and the best pilots have the opportunity to spread their capabilities to others.\n\nSoon the rot will be purged, and the Italian nation will rule the skies of the Mediterannian as it does the sea and the land."

Unless these problems are immediately rectified, we risk losing what capable talent our nation does possess\n\nThankfully, the BN has always been committed to proper reform, and so we shall implement new standards and regulations to keep our Ace's doing what they do best.

#Scorza 1970s Events#

scorzaseventies.1.t:0 "An Alpine Meditation"
scorzaseventies.1.d:0 "The fire crackled and danced, the light from it illuminating the otherwise cold and dark room. In an old chair in front of the fire sat an old and tired king, a cup of tea in his hand. He sipped it as the wind outside caused the window's to creak and moan, little frost angels appearing and just as quickly melting away by the heat emanating from the fire.\n\nA door creaked open and his son entered, slowly taking a seat next to the king in order to not derail the old man's train of thought. As he gazed at the man's tired and unfocused gaze, the Crown Prince without even thinking reached out and took his father's hand. \"Come to bed father, it's getting late. Whatever is troubling you so, I'm sure sitting here and staring off into the fire isn't fixing it.\"\n\nThe old man didn't react for an uneasy couple of seconds before slowly, he turned his head to look at his son, a tired look in his eyes. \"I can't... I haven't managed to have a good night's sleep since that man, Scorza, survived the latest round of protests. He's planning something, I can sense it, and I... I feel as if I'm playing chess against a man who I can't even see the pieces of. No matter what I do I... I... need to get some sleep...\"\n\nWithout another word, the old man got up from his chair and made his way to his room, leaving his son alone with the dying fire."
scorzaseventies.1.a:0 "Surely it's just an old man's paranoia."

scorzaseventies.2.t:0 "A Letter to the Youth" # Scorza and the PNF publish a new doctrine of fascism, formalizing what they've done as fascism, giving ground to their reformism being part of fascist doctrine
scorzaseventies.2.d:0 "\"Students and children of Italy, lend me your ears and your hearts for just one moment!\"\n\n\"I have, since the moment of assuming power, strove to prove only one thing: that fascism is not a decrepit doctrine of your parents and teachers, but instead a doctrine for all Italians including you. It is undeniable that the civil, political, and economic victories given to you by my leadership have made the Italian people the bane of the world. From the decadent dance halls of New York to the poverty ridden slums of Bangladesh, all silently wish that they could have had the good fortune to have been born an Italian. Tell me, are these fruits something that a decrepit and fixed dogma could have produced? The answer to that is of course, no.\"\n\n\"Fascism is a living, breathing idea, one that has changed for today's generation just as it will change for the generation after us. Fascism can not die for it is eternally living. Fascism can not be displaced and rejected by the future for it is the future. Fascism is an ideology that will never falter, never stumble, never be replaced. It is the only ideology that can truly guide Italy to the destiny she deserves.\n\nI will end this letter by promising that the best days are still ahead for not just us, but for fascism itself. Avanti Italia!\""
scorzaseventies.2.a:0 "Signed, Duce Carlo Scorza."

scorzaseventies.3.t:0 "Scorza's Absurdity" # Term limits established for Il Duce, this was surprisingly done by Scorza, this is weird? Is he planning something?
scorzaseventies.3.d:0 "When the rumor had first reached his hotel room in Rome, the New York Times foreign consultant who received it had skimmed it, written it off as a prank, and then proceeded to crumple the report up and toss it into the trash. The very idea that report had suggested was, to put it bluntly, completely and utterly fucking absurd. An authoritarian fascist state such as Italy, one that refused to leave behind the 1930s like much of the world had outside of its Duce's often strange reforms and proclamations about fascism was a consistent actor, a rational actor. The idea of such a state changing its entire system so radically by implementing something as ill defined as term limits? Total poppycock.\n\nSeveral days had passed without any updates to suggest such a policy was truly to be implemented and, much to neither his future shame nor pride, the foreign correspondent had more or less written off the rumor. And then, at only a little past eight in the morning, he was awoken to the sounds of students marching and cheering in the streets. Opening the blinds, he peaked through to see a mass of young fascists and veteran blackshirts, some carrying portraits of Scorza and others waving around letters. As he stared at this demonstration, amused, he picked up his hotel room's telephone and dialed the correspondent for the Washington Post.\n\n\"Morning Jack.\" \n\"Morning Steve\" \n\"Hey, do you know what the demonstrations are for today?\" \n\"You haven't heard yet man? It's the strangest thing I've heard in all my years of working this beat. Scorza himself went on the radio this morning and announced that he's putting a limit on how many years someone can be Duce, it's got the youth all abuzz with hopes for further reforms.\"\n\nThe foreign correspondent was silent for a long time before speaking again."
scorzaseventies.3.a:0 "\"What?\""

scorzaseventies.4.t:0 "Greeting the Future" # Huge rally with Scorza leading, he's looking frail but as excited as ever!
scorzaseventies.4.d:0 "The old man stood at the back of the rally, his grandson excitedly cheering the man taking the stage in front of them. A new generation of Blackshirts stood in front of Il Duce, ones who had never known the struggles of the earlier days, experienced the first march all those years ago which brought Il Duce to power in the first place. It filled his old heart with joy to see the youth follow the same light that he had all those years ago.\n\nHis mind began to drift as he thought about it, images appearing in his head as he did so. 1922, the year it all began, Blackshirts marching proudly through the streets of Rome as the radios played news of the King's capitulation. Fourteen years later, the triumph in Ethiopia. His mother had been so proud to see her boy returning as a war hero. Another nine years later, the victory celebrations in Rome, Mussolini raising his hands in triumph as he declared Italy victorious. On the stage, Scorza raised his own hands in victory, and unnoticed by the old man, his grandson cheered.\n\nSeveral years later, Il Duce had died, Ciano was in power now. Chaos in the Mediterranean, uncertainty for the future of the movement he had dedicated so much to. More rallies, more bombs, war in the Orient as the Turks stabbed us in the back. He was there at his son's funeral, the other members of his squad and old blackshirts in attendance with him. Another year later, the triumph of Scorza fills his heart with hope once more, more marches, more victories, more pride in his homeland with every passing day. On the stage, Scorza calls out to the youth, who enthusiastically cry back, swearing their allegiance to fascism.\n\nEven more years, his grandson becoming active in party politics much to his quiet pride. The years begin to blur as the man thinks through it all. He looks up at Il Duce on the stage. He looks frail, so frail, just like him. His Grandson, God bless his soul, had gotten so excited by Il Duce's declarations that he had pushed through the crowd to cheer on the Black Shirts. A smile crept onto his face as he watched this, a single tear running down his cheek."
scorzaseventies.4.a:0 "A lifetime of service."

scorzaseventies.5.t:0 "Fascism for the Common Man" # Fascism begins to have representation of the common man, an odd advancement in doctrine, but no one seems to oppose this radical ideal.
scorzaseventies.5.d:0 "The pamphlet had arrived in a specially marked envelope, the PNF symbol clearly printed on the outside of it. Similar envelopes had, over the past week, been sent to nearly every household in Italy deemed \"politically palatable\" by the party bureaucracy in line with the directive sent down from the top. Some of the bureaucrats who compiled this had, naturally, been bewildered by the implications of the order but, it was not their place to question the wisdom of Il Duce.\n\nWhen anyone would open the envelope, they would find a simple pamphlet folded in half. Unfolding it, a simple introductory message was present, informing them that they had been selected to help influence the future of fascism within Italy. Several rows of questions were present, each one offering a different proposed policy and a scale going from \"Very Unfavorable\" to \"Very Favorable\" in order for the person filling out the pamphlet to offer his view on the matter. Questions had, of course, been carefully drafted in such a way to ensure a \"desirable\" response from the voters while also not appearing to be clearly biased towards any position. It had taken quite a few frustrating nights to achieve this, but as they say, nothing good can be produced without a little elbow grease."
scorzaseventies.5.a:0 "The common man can have his democracy, and we will make sure they choose correctly."

scorzaseventies.6.t:0 "Controlling the Party" # Threaten the opponents of our efforts and maybe bribe them (conservatives)
scorzaseventies.6.d:0 "It had been a busy week for his squad, far busier than even during the riots and upheaval of the oil crisis. Every Monday a new letter was delivered to an unmarked post box with a list of names, most of them no name minor bureaucrats and officials within the PNF. Each name would be underlined with one of three colors, the number of colors oftentimes corresponding with any other equipment given to his squad with the letter.\n\nIf a name was underlined in red, the order was to find and intimidate the person. Couple bruises, maybe even a broken bone if they were being stubborn. Just enough to get them to shut up and follow orders. If a name was underlined in gold, the order was to try and bribe them, usually with auxiliary funds provided for the mission. Course, some people weren't interested in being bribed with money, so if necessary additional names would be provided for prostitutes, drug dealers, and anything else that's exotic. Finally, if a name was underlined in black... well, it didn't take much to figure out what that meant.\n\nLooking at the list he had received today, he saw five names. Three were underlined in red, a group of local politicians who hung around at the same cafes and smoked the same cigars, each one more conservative of a fascist than the next. Next name was underlined in gold, some local stockbroker. A few gold coins had been provided with the letter, ones that looked like they dated all the way back to when Venice had a Doge, so that seemed self explanatory enough. Final name was underlined in black, some local policeman and hardline fascist. He pitied the poor man as he drew his gun and loaded it. Policing could be such a dangerous profession."
scorzaseventies.6.a:0 "Discipline will be maintained in these trying times."

scorzaseventies.7.t:0 "Dual Meetings" # "the plan" comes together, scorza meets with Borghese, Umberto gets more weary, forshadow to him calling Sogno
scorzaseventies.7.d:0 "At exactly six in the evening, two cars departed from two different residencies on two different sides of Rome. In one car traveled Junio Borghese, a close friend and ally of Il Duce, and in the other car traveled the Crown Prince of Italy, a look of worry on his face. Both had vastly different reasons to travel to meet their respective confidants, yet like most things in politics, it would be lying to say that they weren't connected. As they traveled, both men were left to their own thoughts as their respective drivers navigated the often busy and twisting streets of the capital.\n\nBorghese, an old man who still burned with passion and love for Fascism, considered every angle of the plan he had been sent last night in a letter. It was bold, to be sure, but such boldness was necessary to push Italy forward onto the world stage. It would take much effort to build the web of networks the Duce had asked for, but for him, no effort was too large to protect the ideology he truly loved.\n\nFor the Crown Prince, his trip was much less pleasant. Every mile of it he was left thinking about his father and his state of mind, and the letter a servant had slipped to him when they were sure any prying eyes weren't watching. It was from his father to a certain general -which one he couldn't tell due to the name being written in code- requesting an urgent meeting with him at once. He had no way of knowing for sure why his father had done such a thing, but he had a pretty good guess.\n\nScorza. That damned rat was constantly scheming and plotting something, and whatever he had cooking this time, it certainly could not be good. He had succeeded all those years ago to shut the page that was about to turn, and he would be damned if he was going to allow him to do it again. Leaning forward, he told his driver to step on it."

scorzaseventies.8.d:0 "It had taken every ounce of skill the party bosses had to force through the new directive sent down from the top. Many had felt almost helpless when first reading it, unsure exactly how they were to so fundamentally change decades of passed laws and indeed, the very constitution itself in the time allotted to them. Still, it was quite clear that failure in this matter was not an option, especially with the number attached to the notice. \"1-49\", or as some quickly recognized it to mean, January 49: the month Caesar crossed the rubicon.\n\nWith an iron grit of determination, the party bosses set to work implementing the directive. Every favor earned through years of service was called in, a virtual media block out was carried out to ensure the King's allies would be blindsided when the announcement was made. Eyes were kept on every individual member of the team responsible for the entire operation, as even the slightest slip up could mean the failure of the gambit. A couple close calls were made, perhaps the closest being when one of the bosses had gotten careless with a secretary at lunch and had spilled the beans. It took a new wardrobe, an all expense paid trip to New York, and a bonus to her elderly father's pension for her to agree to keep quiet on it.\n\nFinally, after much hard work, it became time to step up to the plate. In a shock media announcement, Il Duce made it clear that in an unprecedented move, he had amended the constitution to strip the royal court of all direct ability to influence policy. Within minutes, the Bosses' work came into effect. Local challenges to the change were strangled in the crib before they could get off the ground, embarrassing media challenges were silenced, and protests were kept at a minimum. When it was all over, they drank a toast to themselves and a job well done."

scorzaseventies.9.d:0 "At around 10 in the morning, it was first discovered that Edgardo Sogno, well known royalist and military general, had gone missing. By 10:20, the news had reached the office of Il Duce, setting off a frantic series of searches and phone calls to members of the military brass across the country. By 10:45, the news had reached the now isolated royal court, catching the already irritated and gravely suspicious King off guard. By 10:58 his son, having received an urgent call from the man, arrived to find him lying on his side on a sofa. Initially panicked by it, it took until 11:02 for his father to calm him down enough for the two to talk. This is the conversation they had, as later testified by them:\n\nUmberto II (U): \"Thank you for coming as I requested my son, I'm not sure I could face the coming trials without you.\" \nPrince Vittorio Emanuele (VE) \"Please father, it was nothing. What is it that you need from me? I can not lie to you, I have been very concerned of your health recently.\" \nU: \"My Son... you are truly loyal to me and your country, far more than I could ever have expected. It is my great shame to admit to you that I have lied to you and deceived you. The letter you showed me several weeks ago, addressed to that General? I sent that to General Sogno, to discuss taking action against Scorza-\" \nVE: \"Father, you should have told me!\" \nU: \"And for that I am sorry, I should have trusted you then as I do now. I have been informed that the General has now gone missing, and I do not truly know if that is a good or ill omen for us. A great battle is approaching within this country, and I truly do not know if it is even possible for us to win. I am truly sorry my son, I should have done more...\""

scorzaseventies.10.d:0 "By the dawn of the next day, it had become obvious to the King and his Son that whatever had happened to General Sogno, it was almost impossible to imagine it had been anything pleasant. Despite this, for several more days they still held out hope, waiting on the off chance that their worst fears would be proven wrong. Eventually, even they had to face the truth, as many other Italian conservatives, anti-Scorza fascists, and other dissenters would: no one was coming to their rescue. With a dejected sigh, the Crown Prince drove home from his father's residence, a lingering dread in the back of his throat.\n\nFor several decades after the fact, the Sogno Incident as it would come to be called remained an intensely debated topic for not just the usual conspiracy theorists and crackpots, but for many mainstream academics as well. Some would come to claim that the obvious explanation was the best one: Scorza had simply found out about the man's plan and arranged for him to disappear into one of the regime's many black holes in Africa and the Balkans. Another favorite explanation would come to be called the Brazil theory, claiming that Sogno had, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, simply fled to South America to live out in peace there away from the power games being played in Rome. Still, even more wild explanations would come to be offered as well, claiming things as wild as a Burgundian connection, a plan by the Japanese Kenpeitai, the involvement of New York Mafia Dons, and at the very fringes of the movement, alien abduction. It remains impossible to say what truly happened, but the fact remains that for the dissenters against the Fascist orthodoxy enforced by Scorza in Italy at the time, Sogno's disappearance simply became one more addition to a long list of disappointments."

Despite this, for several more days they still held out hope, waiting on the off chance that their worst fears would be proven wrong. They were at the end of their wits when the garrison in Rome rebelled alongside several others across the country. The Golpe Sogno as it would come to be called surprised nearly everyone across the political spectrum, the King who requested it most of all. Scorza and his allies attempted to fight it off with everything they had, to the point of even calling on the students to rise up and fight for them in the streets but ultimately, with the army rallied behind him, Sogno's success was inevitable.\n\nIt was as a triumphant hero that Sogno was received by the King at his residence, a virtual army of bureaucrats, aides, and guards accompanying him to the meeting. The two sat together in the king's parlor as reporter after reporter snapped photos of the two together for papers across the globe. As it slowly began to calm down, the King turned his head and spoke to the General. \"So General, what is the next item on your agenda?\"\n\nThe general looked back at him, a hint of surprise in his face as he smiled. \"You don't seem to understand the situation, your majesty. I am just a general but you are the very king of this nation. The question isn't what are my orders for you, the question is what are your orders for us?\"\n\nAs he listened to the man speak and the sounds of protesters in the distance, a frown began to form on Umberto's face."

scorzaseventies.12.d:0 "The elevator slowly descended down to the first floor, several guards standing within it along with Il Duce, their faces steely and their weapons prepared as always. Scorza himself stood behind them, his face and hands wrinkled and saggy with age, but his uniform and eyes as bright and burning as always. The entire elevator was, to put it simply, at a loss for words with everything that had transpired in the hours prior to the ride. On the side of the elevator, a speaker chimed in to announce that it was 5 in the afternoon, and before it had even moved on to its next announcement, Scorza's mind had begun to wander to everything that happened.\n\nIt started at the beginning of the day, the big announcement and press conference where they had announced the long suspected final step in his plans for fascism. Evidence had been found, he claimed, proving the King and certain members of the general staff had been in cahoots for a plan to forcibly remove the legitimate government from power and institute a policy of slavish obedience to the Germans. It was clear then, he continued, that Italy could not prosper under such circumstances, that something had to be done. He paused then for dramatic effect before dropping the long expected bombshell. \"The Italian monarchy, a reactionary and anti-fascist institution, must go!\"\n\nThe news had polarized Italy like he had expected, and it had taken every previous precaution taken to ensure no mass upheaval would occur. For some time he had felt the very tension in the air itself, constantly wrapping itself around him and his allies and squeezing them for dear life. It was just when he was about to lose hope that the good news had come to him: the King and the royal family had boarded a plane and left for Washington.\n\nThe breaking of that news had finally cut the tension, and with a triumphant look, he had greeted the crowds from the same balcony Mussolini had stood on all those years ago to announce the creation of a new nation: the Italian Social Republic. As the crowds roared with approval and patriotism, he knew that somewhere out there, his predecessors in the party were looking down on him with pride in their eyes.\n\nAs the elevator finally reached its destination, he reached up and wiped a single tear from his cheek. He was an old man now with not much time left, that much was obvious, but he had accomplished everything he set out to do. Fascism had won its victory over Italy itself."

scorzaseventies.13.d:0 "He sat alone in his office, a small glass of wine and ashtray his only accompaniment for the dreary hours of the early morning. Despite the great triumph he had overseen with the creation of the Republic, Scorza hadn't had a good nights sleep since, an unknown feeling weighing on his mind. As he moved to pour himself another drink, a gust of wind shook his window, turning his attention towards it.\n\nWalking over to the window, he made sure to secure it, while at the same time, he gazed out at the landscape of sleeping Rome. The streets were mostly empty, the houses dark, and the markets silent. Only an old man and his dog walked the streets at this hour, the man's face and hands weary but his clear love for the dog obvious. As Scorza watched the man, he felt a strong desire rising up within him, a will that he and the man could switch positions. He had accomplished so much in his tenure, he was sure of that, but in this moment he was just an old man, one who's youth had long faded away. He closed his eyes to break his gaze at the old man, but the idea refused to go away.\n\nWhen he returned to his desk, he opened a drawer and took out a sheet of stationary and a pen. Part of him screamed for him to stop, to turn back and face the power and wealth surely ahead of him, yet even more told him to finish what he had begun. The party had been hinting at it for years, and he had resisted them. Now, he was not so sure if he would.\n\nWith lingering doubt, Scorza began to write his letter of resignation."

Their whispers of change and promises of everything to everyone can be as destabilising as any number of car bombs planted to sow terror. Enough!

It was less than a decade ago that Ciano stuffed the party with his reformers, and if the worst offenders have since been displaced, we must act now to ensure the instability plaguing Italian minds does not enter the party as well.

There will be no complacency. If we must impose martial law, then the Army will be ready, and if it comes time to bash in the chests of their kinsmen, the Army shall carry out the order.

Instability, insurrection and disorder are not merely the actions of sinful men - they serve the Prince of Darkness himself, and the partisans act as the perverted lapdogs of the enemy of Christ.

This should do much to reassure not only the King's traditional allies among the landowners and the industrialists, but also the Government and the civil service itself. For if Carlo Scorza is committed in full to the cause represented by the King, then how could he be expected to do harm to Italy?

He must remind them, as they sometimes forget, that Italian dominance is the basis of everything they hold dear; that the appeal to pride in Italy is no mere trick, but the fullest expression of their deepest desires; that without Italy and without the Italian Nation they are nothing.

Despite Carlo Scorza's promises, he has failed to ensure stability and peace. For if the anti-fascists have tanks, God knows what else they possess at their disposal, and how far they will go to achieve the destruction of Fascism in Italy. For the honest breadwinners amongst our population, who spend their energy everyday to earn a better life for their children, the worst thing is not knowing.

Already, politicians and government officials are reaching the Agide by plane, boat and rail much like they had done not so long ago. News teams are sent and arrive long before any delegations do, and the whole of Italy sits in waiting to see in what way Scorza shall lead them.\n\nFascism has always been a fickle thing, and there is no doubt it needs defining.

Showcasing to the Italian people the rich history their nation has in its ideology alone, it has reinvigorated a sense of national pride amongst a percentage of them.\n\nOf course though, some groups that would see Scorza fall detest this as a poor propagandist effort that fell flat on its face, and with their words they carry support.

Frustration and confusion now rule the lower party, but they are all but unbeknownst to the true reasons as to why they cannot achieve what they want.\n\nThe upper party has become gratuitous for Scorza's actions, and not only will the PNF remain in its old ways, but it will also be more loyal to the state and the government it services.

As Duce Scorza put in an announcement earlier this week, "Rome may be dead, but her legacy is eternal. Let us secure this legacy as ours, once and for all!"\n\nComparisons have been drawn to every faucet of Italy's power projection. Infantry divisions marching through the sands of Africa to legions treading in the forests of Germania. Proud battleships sailing throughout what remains of the Mediterranean to triremes doing battle with Carthage. In general, the public have adored these contrasts and a renewed interest has been found in Roman history and the wellbeing of Italy's empire as a whole.

In sharp contrast, the Regio Esercito has time and time again turned away from the powers in Rome in favour of supposedly democratic politicians like the traitor Ciano, or the King who wishes to see his own nation corrupted. These being the thoughts of Scorza have inevitably led to the MSVN, or Blackshirts, being favored heavily for conducting operations within and without Italy, becoming a sort of second army in their own right.

nscorza.13.d:0 ""The Carabinieri serve officially as the gendarmerie of the Kingdom of Italy, or military police. As a result, they hold most of their loyalties towards the monarchy and reformist factions, but this is currently acceptable. A detachment of these men will be sent into Verona to suppress protests and cover up the failed Second Verona Conference, and best of all, without any bloodshed! Duce Scorza clearly knows how to play these factions against each other."

nscorza.14.t:0 "A State of Panic" # Scirza declares a national emergency, somewhat of an overreaction, but there are traitors within the PNF that threaten the stability of italy. They are to be dealt with. (DONE)
nscorza.14.d:0 "Once again, Italy was in a present state of extremity and panic, something the nation had become used to by now. However, this time, there wasn't much to actually panic about. Scorza has declared a state of emergency country-wide due to recent protests at Verona and political failures currently ongoing, which is seen primarily as an overreaction. Many say there is a deeper level to this decision however, an attempt to take administrative action and root out dissenters within the PNF itself. Of course, anybody who says this mysteriously disappears by the next morning, but it is probably nothing to worry about."
nscorza.14.a:0 "Entirely necessary!"

nscorza.15.t:0 "Bloody Hands" # Verona is cleansed. Blood on the regimes hands this early only shows that they have the guts to do what Ciano couldn't. Italy's road to redemption has started, and Scorza will pave the way to make the ride smooth. (DONE)
nscorza.15.d:0 "Screams rang out across the courtyard for hours after the carnage ended. Friends and family clutched their dying loved ones as the fires were stoked even higher, crowds being beaten and forced to scurry away as bodies were trampled over. It seems the Carabinieri have gone far from our expectations. Damage control and information suppression is now in effect.\n\nScorza and his administration has declared that 4 protesters have been killed in riot control at Verona by military police. Instead of decrying these actions, they have instead declared blood on their hands this early is simply indicative of their willpower to see Italy's destiny through, unlike Ciano. People are outraged, but it is doubtless Verona is cleansed. Scorza has shown he means business."

nscorza.16.t:0 "Paint the Town Red" # The army is sent in to deal with Verona dissenters, they get kind of fucked up, more people in verona die (keep death toll low, like 8 max, possibly lower) but the army failed their mission, make the title vague dont have it be like 'failure at verona' (DONE)
nscorza.16.d:0 "Verona was beginning to become a town stained with blood, chaos and death. Protests and riots have begun to spill over into the surrounding countryside like a deluge of violence. Inevitably, more soldiers are required to contain the situation, but today it proved too much. A detachment of the 4th Infantry Division Livorno was overrun by an onslaught of rioters after a brutal melee battle, resulting in even more deaths. The army was forced to retreat to the city outskirts and lick its wounds as the riots devolved into somewhat of a siege. 3 infantrymen and 5 rioters have been reported dead, bringing the grand total of dead to 12. The actions being conducted at the city have become notorious throughout the world, and by connection, so has the Scorza administration for its brutality. Instability has begun to take hold, but Scorza's iron rule will keep things in check for now."
nscorza.16.a:0 "Ready for battle!"

nscorza.17.t:0 "Nothing Happened" # Nothing occurred in Verona, there were some dissenters, but through Duce Scorza's wise words it was resolved. There was no military intervention, there were no traitors. Scorza is saving the Italian regime.
nscorza.17.d:0 "A campaign of disinformation, disorientation and confusion is treading Italy. The disastrous events which occurred at Verona are now being erased from history and memory. No books or records are allowed to contain even a shred of information about the city's recent history. Those publicly speaking about it suddenly shut up the next day, or are never found again. Bribes and threats, back alley deals and murders. Everything is being done to stop the flood of information, every track covered by the OVRA and paper trails leading to dead ends.\n\nThose who remember the chaos of those short few weeks keep it to themselves, or face the brunt force of Scorza's regime. Slowly and surely people will forget and a new story will be written. There was no intervention, there were no riots. Scorza is Italy's leader, he will lead it to victory!"

nscorza.1400.t:0 "Onto Business" # Scorza has worked out the council (be vague, event fires no matter the outcome), now it is time to move on to the many questions the new administration faces: economic, social status, domestic issues, global issues, european influence, etc. (DONE)
nscorza.1400.d:0 "After a tenuous few months, Scorza has finally worked out his council on the path he has designed for Italy. The administration will bend and obey his every order and command at a whim. With an obedient government, Scorza has turned his eyes onto the problems strangling Italy at the moment. The shambles of an economy which barely crawls along, bruised and beaten by the horrors of Atlantropa. The many social issues that plague the everyday lives of Italy's sons and daughters, women's rights, minority recognition, and much more.\n\nDomestic problems, political and not. Divides which tear apart at the very fabric of the Italian nation and consciousness. Italy's prominence on the world stage, her empire and influence. And, of course, the issue that is the European continent. The hungry wolf of Germany baring its teeth to her north, a reckless and delinquent Balkan peninsula to her east, treacherous and backstabbing "allies" challenging her dominance of the Mediterranean. Italy surely has many problems, but Scorza shall see her through them, one way or another."

nscorza.18.t:0 "Man's Partner" # The question of women's role in society, some opt to rebrand for a better look of italians overall, some opt for maintaining the patriarchy (DONE)
nscorza.18.d:0 "Women comprise half of the entire population of Italy, yet have always been placed on the sidelines of any administrative action. Given leeway whenever convenient, like the suffragette movement. Fascism has always put them in the place of housewives, child bearers, homemakers, whatever else to disadvantage them. But Duce Scorza sees the issue inherent within this form of thought. For Italy to function as a united nation, its population must share control amongst themselves, equal opportunities so everyone may bring Italy to her full potential.\n\nUnfortunately, and inevitably however, there are those who disagree. Those who wish to maintain the patriarchy which Mussolini held up. Scorza will go along with either, it is simply a matter of deciding once and for all what role women will play in society. One option will upset the other, as always."
nscorza.18.a:0 "Women, can't live with them, can't live without them!"

nscorza.19.t:0 "The Idol of Desire" # The Female Face of Fascism, hard to find one, there's debate over who it should be, yet theres not really a notable female fascist figure within italy that people can agree on. (DONE)
nscorza.19.d:0 "There have been new social endeavors to bring women to the forefront of society and national administration, but one problem remains. Fascism has always been built around the prominence of a single figure in the middle, and in this situation it is no different. To propagate the further empowerment of women within Italy, there must be a leader of their movement, a female face of fascism, as some have said.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that there is no real person to fill this role. While there are of course female figures that have spearheaded certain divisions or individual movements, there is not yet one that can be agreed upon to lead the entirety of "feminist fascism". This problem must be rectified quickly lest any momentum built up thus far be lost."
nscorza.19.a:0 "If not strongman, is it strongwoman?"

nscorza.20.t:0 "In Kitchens, Not Offices!" # Fascism Feminism is made up, it isnt real. The patriarchy will stay. (DONE)
nscorza.20.d:0 "Recent endeavors to empower women within Italy have ultimately fallen flat on its face in favour of the patriarchal status quo. Shortcomings, mishaps and a lack of public support have seen the movement stopped in its tracks by the powers in place and their wide conservative support base. The idea that the entirety of "feminist fascism" is infact made up and never had any bearings in reality has been pushed to every informative faucet in the nation.\n\nThose that still remain on the sinking ship bicker and fight as leaders jump and funding moves away, specifically Carlo Scorza and his administration, who have conceded and moved to support the patriarchy. It seems the dream of equality will remain that, a dream."
nscorza.20.a:0 "What a stupid idea, anyway."

nscorza.25.t:0 "The New Face of Fascism!" # The everyday female is the face of fascism! Every day is a fight but the italian woman stands strong. Based fascism. (DONE)
nscorza.25.d:0 "Few think progressive when they hear the word fascism, let alone when they hear the name Carlo Scorza. Yet, expectations have been blown aside once again. New propaganda posters and brochures have been printed and posted into every major city throughout Italy. All are attempts to push the new and successful feminist rhetoric which has dominated the Italian social and political atmosphere for weeks on end.\n\nThese words speak of the Italian woman, brave in the face of everyday challenges and the patriarchy, pushing forwards to bring glory to Italy. "The new face of fascism" have become words famous, the catchphrase of the feminist movement. Few ever expected the women's rights movement to pick up traction in an ideology so far right as fascism, and yet here we are. Beyond the obvious propaganda benefits of this, this also opens the door for interesting military and economic avenues not possible before. Perhaps, eventually, women could march alongside men on the battlefield or work hand in hand on the factory floor. A whole new world has opened up, all thanks to Duce Scorza!"
nscorza.25.a:0 "That was unexpected."

nscorza.26.t:0 "The Modern Housewife" # Women are meant to answer to their husbands or be trained to do so. (DONE)
nscorza.26.d:0 "The history of the dynamic between man and woman has, for the most part, always been one of dominance and subservience. Husband and wife. There have been concessions when necessary to keep up war industry or the smooth pace of society, yet things have always stayed relatively the same. Recent developments have attempted to change that, with support unseen before in modern history. But still, it has all failed. The patriarchy remains in place, and will for much longer to go.\n\nBecause the patriarchy remains, so must its ideas. The wife is meant to obey the husband, as such has been the way for centuries, and so must be the way it is. Public announcements, propaganda and demonstrations speak these words, demanding the train of progressive change be stopped, and so it has. Been blown off the track, it seems. The wife will stay home and tend to the familial unit, and the husband will work his job to provide for the family. It mustn't change."
nscorza.26.a:0 "Some things stay the same."

nscorza.31.d:0 "Italy is the way it is today because of the actions of men since dead or driven to old age. Now a proud eagle spread across her rightful domain of the Mediterranean, without them she would've stayed an irrelevant continental power playing second fiddle to Britain, France and Germany. There are those however that have strayed from the light present within the teachings of these men, the detritus of decades of decadence taking a toll on the psyche of the Italian population.\n\nThose that would wish to see all Italy has been built upon, all that was striven for in the Great Wars destroyed shall be silenced and buried as they deserve. Soldiers will parade through the streets, stamping down on protest. Tanks will roll in grand columns, crushing dissent beneath their mighty tracks. Disrespect towards the modern founding fathers of Italy, and as a whole the nation, will receive no tolerance."
nscorza.31.a:0 "Patriotism is not optional."

nscorza.33.t:0 "The Ways of the Future" # the future is decided by the minds of today. we must listen to the youth and their thoughts on reforming fascims (DONE)
nscorza.33.d:0 "The youth of the nation will inevitably rise to lead it, and with it come their ideas. The old guard cannot stay in power for eternity, and succession must be aligned before all is too late. The youth of the party hold many thoughts on how to better fascism to fit the modern reality, and as a whole ready Italy for the challenges ahead of her. Theirs is a noble cause, and one we have ignored for too long.\n\nOld and tired leaders shall be replaced by those more keen and fit. The minds of today will power the engines which drive forward administration and keep things on track. Failing theories will be buried and in their place those prepared for the modern day. The legacy of the past must be kept sacred and remembered, but decrepit fossils cannot manage a young state."
nscorza.33.a:0 "Out with the old, in with the young."

nscorza.34.t:0 "If It Ain't Broke"
nscorza.34.d:0 "Italy is great, and always has been. The same practices which were born after the slaughter of the First Great War saw Italy through the uncertainty of the interwar period, and claimed for her an empire of gold in the Second Great War. These practices have kept Italy the way it is for decades on end and show no discernible signs of failure. Those reckless younglings that would see Mussolini's legacy torn asunder in favor of untested, untrue theories mustn't be allowed anywhere near an administrative office.\n\nThe men who run the PNF shook hands with Mussolini, were the ones that forged fascism in the flames of the March on Rome. They were the ones that sent brave men to fight and die in the hills of Greece, the plains of Yugoslavia and the sands of Egypt. They, and they alone, know how to run Italy, and how fascism is intended to be. Notions of reform and change are overrated and childish. The current course will be stayed and bring us through this storm, as it had many before."
nscorza.34.a:0 "Why fix it?"

nscorza.35.t:0 "The Man in the Vatican" # the vatican is not a fan of our fascist policy, we must work out a way on how to deal with them (DONE)
nscorza.35.d:0 "Scorza's administration and fascism as a whole has deep rooted support within the Catholic Christian population base of Italy, but much of this support is based around a single man, a single city.\n\nThe Pope, the ruler of the Vatican City, has always held a distaste for the authoritarian tendencies of fascism and as a result his beliefs have spread throughout Christianity. Whatever the Pope says is liable to be followed in close stride by all of Christendom, and Italy is no different.\n\nOf course, the Pope cannot simply be assassinated and it be covered up as a fall down the stairs. We must convene a meeting of the minds and figure out a method to deal with him. Perhaps it's time to finally finish 1870. Maybe not."
nscorza.35.a:0 "Those siege walls can't stand up to bombers!"

nscorza.36.t:0 "A Crumbling City" # we shall not bend to the church. we must move our population away from the thoughts of the petty city of the vatican (DONE)
nscorza.36.d:0 "The Vatican is always working in the benefit of the Pope. Never professing the truth or working for the Italian people, or Christendom itself. The Pope is a liar, cheat and most importantly a scam artist! Him and his city cannot be trusted, not by Rome and not by Italy.\n\nSuch were the words of Scorza as he made a public address earlier this morning. Years of building tensions between the Vatican and the Italian administration have finally come to a head as Rome has severed most ties with the Holy See and declared the Pope untrustworthy. All of this comes from a fresh campaign to pull apart Italian Christianity and the Pope in light of the realization that the Pope wields much influence over the population, and any hateful rhetoric directed towards fascism will inevitably wash over the people of Italy.\n\nA campaign like this is audaciously ambitious at best, but Scorza and his administration remain confident they can pull off such a monumental societal transformation."
nscorza.36.a:0 "The Pope and Christianity are one and the same!"

nscorza.37.t:0 "The Concordat" # fascism only got this far due to the concordat. we shall review it and see where to go from here (DONE)
nscorza.37.d:0 "The relationship between Italy and the Vatican is one born in the short but chaotic War of 1870, which finalized the unification of the Italian peninsula. The Pope, once upon a time presiding over central Italy, is now limited to the Vatican City, in reality a "state" the size of a palace. Hiding behind the city's massive stone walls until 1929, the Pope eventually conceded to signing a deal and maintaining the stability of the church.\n\nThe Lateran Treaty, better known as the Concordat was created in Rome and finalized the borders between the Papal State and the Kingdom of Italy. Since the rise of fascism, a tense but amicable existence has continued to exist until now. Scorza's attempts at pushing at the Pope have brought things to a breaking point. It is decidedly so then that the Concordat shall be reviewed and the next few decisions taken based upon that. The Papal relationship must be preserved, for the wellbeing of Christianity as a whole."
nscorza.37.a:0 "The church is nothing without the Pope."

nscorza.38.d:0 "Italy, as it stands now, is a very diverse nation in every way imaginable. Arab Muslims buy from Italian Christians in bustling street markets. Agnostics marry devout theists, Chinese traditionalists converse with Alpine pagans! Italy is a nation that holds many different beliefs, many different ethnicities and many different people. To consign itself to a single following would be dismissive towards the many other citizens who serve under the Italian banner.\n\nAnd so, as it is today, Italy is a secular nation by decree of Duce Scorza. A move considered radical by many more conservative elements in Italy, it will serve as an unexpected solution to the current Papal crisis. By not playing to the Pope's games of religion, Scorza will inevitably win either way! Of course though, this has placed quite a few divides within the nation, but it is hoped time will mend any differences and bring the whole country onto a brighter future. After all, we are all sons and daughters of Italy, why not act as such?"
nscorza.38.a:0 "Is this the right move?"

nscorza.39.t:0 "Servants of the Flag" # The state is whats important, everyone here is under the PNF, not everyone here is catholic (DONE)
nscorza.39.d:0 "Every one person who lives and breaths and dies in Italy has swore a silent oath to the flag, to serve the nation forever and always, till death ends their duty. The state, the nation, is the one that controls everything, not the church. Every citizen of Italy exists under the watchful eye of the PNF, not the Pope. Our policy should reflect this truth. Devout religion is a thing of the past, nationalism and service to the state is the present! The bible shall be replaced with the manifesto, the priests' robes with uniform and medals. This entire Papal charade is nothing but the death throes of an increasingly irrelevant church, one being smothered by the boot of the state. Everyone will be a part of the PNF, not everyone is a part of the Catholic Church."

nscorza.40.d:0 "The reality of our situation is that the church is and always has been a staple of Italian culture, society and nation, and is liable to be for many more years to come. We cannot simply wash away its grand influence over the population, or replace it with another following. It is the unfortunate truth that we must come to terms with the Pope, and find a solution beneficial to both our parties, lest more chaos be wrought from this little dispute.\n\nA meeting has been scheduled in the mountainous village of Foce between representatives of the government and the Vatican. It is expected a deal will be reached, as it was in 1929. A deal must be reached for the greater good of all Italy. We do not need to like them, and they do not need to like us. We simply need to coexist, and uphold our own dues to the Italian people. Once all of this is cleared up we may move on to greater and better matters."

nscorza.45.d:0 ""A silent bird followed just outside Scorza's view for the whole car ride from the airport. Swooping and diving under, between and beside street posts, canopies, people and cars it followed on. Not a single chirp could be heard from its beak the whole way through, but Scorza knew it was there. A black bird. One with a sharp, vantablack beak and ruffled feathers. Piercing beads sat in its eye sockets, jumping back and forth between people and objects.\n\nScorza knew what the bird was. He was never a very spiritualistic man, but he knew it was a sign. A herald. A messenger of things to come, events to follow and the path to be tread. So many things were left to be completed, and he had only begun. He would see Italy through them all, swooping and diving under, between and beside war, famine, crisis and death.\n\nAnd yet, there was a solemn feeling to it. The bird did not sing, the bird did not cry. What was it trying to tell him? Had he done everything right? Was everything truly going to be okay? He had conquered so many problems by now. The women's rights movement, the youth of the party, the church. Everything was solved by him, everything was solvable to him, unlike Ciano. But, there was still a longing for those times. When the urgency was not there, where they dined on fine wines and fat meats every night knowing the next morning would be good. When everything stood still, and just for a moment, it remained outside a blur.\n\nWhere the car screeched to a halt in front of parliament, Scorza's mind did not. Stepping from the car to the pavement, a silent brush of the air could be heard overhead. The black bird soared and flew into the sky, flapping against the breeze, desperate yet determined to go on. And over the parliament's arch did it fly, disappearing from sight. There was so much left to do, and so little time."

Failing to rise up to the horrors of Atlantropa, Italy was plunged into recession by his refusal to take action. Of course, this is just what Scorza would like people to believe. In reality, the economy began to stabilize shortly before the end of Ciano's tenure, but still it is in shambles.\n\nDuce Scorza has drawn up a plan to pick up the pieces left over by the previous administration, but it still needs review and further agreement before it is put into place. A meeting will be convened between the biggest whigs of the economy to decide just how to push Italy forward on the inevitably rocky road ahead of her."

It is no wonder the Italian economy runs at a pace so terribly slow, the men running it likely had their education in the 19th century! These old men will finally be put to their retirement and new, young and ambitious bureaucrats brought in to fill their seats.\n\nNot only the economic echelons will be receiving such swapping either, bureaus of information, police and administration will also receive some light overhauls to push for a better Italy overall.

Regardless of if they are old or prepared to drop dead from their chairs at any moment, they simply need more funds to carry out their work. Any efficient bureaucracy requires a lot of money to stay well oiled, and this is no different. More extreme funding will be transferred to administrative departments so that starving programs may finally get some cash.\n\nIf those in charge do not have the money to do what they must, all of Italy is lost to chaos. It is what makes the world go round, after all. And yet, there are those who protest these actions. They say the system must be overhauled, but their mewling shall be silenced.

nscorza.80.d:0 "The Institute of International Political Studies, or IIPS, has brought up a very important topic relevant to Italy's modern dilemma. Her standing on the world stage, the way the other powers look at her: as a strong and proud empire, or a second rate pawn. The institute itself, mostly just college kids who never figured out what they want to do, has brought forward legitimate choices.\n\nIn olden days, Italy had created a balance of relationships between foreign powers, powers which could make or break Italy's rise to prominence. The Entente and Central Powers in the First Great War, France and Britain in the interwar. The Axis and Allies in the Second, choosing definitively a side only when convenient. The situation Italy faces now is not too different, simply another balance of power between the superpowers of the world. Italy must just nudge the powers off each other to get what she wants.\n\nThere is another proposition however, one more radical. Italy does not need outside help anymore, for she is a powerful empire with domains of her own! Our foreign diplomacy should be modeled directly around what Italy wants and what Italy demands, her sphere and her influence. No more playing second fiddle, no more answering the wishes of other nations. Italy will stand on her own legs.\n\nEither option has their individual merits and inferiorities, but a choice must be made, and be made soon. The vultures are closing in around Italy, and a path must be carved to get out of the chaos to soon ensue."

At times, it can feel as though there is no real way to manage all of it from Rome. But, such thoughts must be dispelled. Italy's empire first must not be thought as overstretched for it to cease being overstretched.\n\nAs such, colonial administrations and vassal governments have been ordered to start integrating their processes with Italy so operations may be run closer and most importantly, smoother. From the towering Alps, to the ruins of Athens. From the grandeur of Rome to the most holy land. From the ancient pyramids of Giza to the sea slums of Mogadishu, the Italian eagle stretches, and proudly does so.

The unfortunate reality of the situation however is that we cannot take full advantage of the resources present within the empire unless our colonial administrations tie their economies even closer with us.\n\nAs such, more departments will be merged and more administrative cheques marked as defunct.

As such, it is only fitting for the entire empire to share the one currency. By making every nation in the Italian sphere trade the same banknotes, many of the processes which circulate money and resources throughout the empire will be much easier.

itapartyunity.2.t:0 "Unity is Everything" # BN and FD are coalitions of rightists and leftists respectively, though their coalition is strong now, it might not always remain that way
itapartyunity.2.d:0 "Politics is a game of balances, of compromises, and where necessary of ruthless betrayal. Above all it is a game of unity, and of coming to an agreement with the right people so that the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. The coalitions making up the Blocchi Nazionali and Fronte Democratico contain a diversity of personality and thought which may appear surprising to the uninformed outsider, who may expect a more cohesive identity to linger behind the surface. Even among groups as ideological as the BN and the FD, however, the importance of convenience and compromise remain central. A man in another country once said that a house divided against itself cannot stand, and whatever we think of the person who said it, it is hard to fault the words."
itapartyunity.2.a:0 "Differences must be overcome, for the greater good."

itapartyunity.3.t:0 "The FD Collapses" # FD officially collapses due to the being ousted by De Lorenzo following the Piano Solo (this only occurs if the FD was previously incharge)
itapartyunity.3.d:0 "After De Lorenzo implemented Piano Solo, ousting the government led by the Fronte Democratico from the halls of power, it was difficult to imagine any outcome other than this. Torn by internal disagreement over what to do now, with previous ideological and personal gaps bubbling to the surface, the Fronte Democratico has collapsed under the weight of its own inflexibility. The leftist coalition's demise is a heavy blow to socialist and social democratic politics throughout Italy, and indeed much of Europe, as a leading flame of the worker's movement is snuffed out."
itapartyunity.3.a:0 "The working man bows his weary head."

itapartyunity.4.t:0 "The BN Collapses" # BN officially collapses due to the being ousted by De Lorenzo following the Piano Solo (this only occurs if the BN was previously incharge)
itapartyunity.4.d:0 "Ferocious arguments, desperate midnight conversations and open recrimination have led to the inevitable. After being ousted from power by De Lorenzo, the Blocchi Nazionali has collapsed, and with it a hope for post-fascist unity in the new order augured by the transition out of old-style fascism. Although some demagogues attempt to rally their troops, saying that the fascist ideal embodied by the BN is not yet dead, it is difficult to imagine the disparate and fiercely competitive elements making up the grouping coming back together."
itapartyunity.4.a:0 "Out of power and out of time."

itapartyunity.5.t:0 "The Fronte Democratico government dissolves" # FD collapses due to "political faults" (coalition got too lopsided and party unity busted), "a new government" will take charge, dont refer to the gov
itapartyunity.5.d:0 "After endless ideological squabbles and factional backstabbing, the Fronte Democratico coalition has proven unable to withstand the strain. The coalition is no more. A new government must now take charge of Italy's destiny, whilst the architects of the coalition's failure lick their wounds and attempt to pick up the pieces.\n\nCarried for a while through sheer stubbornness, the political press will look to interpret why the FD coalition fell at the moment it did, and what could have been done to prevent it. No doubt this will prove an interesting thought experiment for those who treat party politics as a sport. The actual consequences, on Italy's workers and businesses, will no doubt unfold in the longer term. On that front many will give their perspective, but one thing is clear. The fallout of the FD's failure will appear far beyond the claustrophobic halls of party politics."

itapartyunity.6.t:0 "The Blocchi Nazionale government is no more." # BNcollapses due to "political faults" (coalition got too lopsided and party unity busted), "a new government" will take charge, dont refer to the gov
itapartyunity.6.d:0 "Despite the impassioned appeals to national unity and calls to a higher cause made by the Blocchi's party men, the BN coalition has as of today ceased to function. The government's collapse will be answered by a new government taking charge, whilst those who failed to uphold the outgoing administration recriminate and apologise in equal measure.\n\nAs the successors of the fascist legacy in democratic politics, the Blocchi Nazionale have always had a fine tightrope to walk. How harshly they will be judged for failing to hold this coalition together is for the historians. Nevertheless, the immediate consequences are clear enough. The incoming coalition will have to pull together, if not the enthusiasm, then the grudging consent of the segments of Italian society which put the BN in power (and if not, to pretend to do so). Meanwhile the Blocchi attempt to move forward, and to figure out what went wrong."

Knowledgeable, ideally, about the subject itself and the administrative politics surrounding it; able to lead and work with others, certainly. But above all, a civil servant must be loyal. For this reason we have removed the previous project leader for the Italian nuclear programme, giving him an appropriate position to keep him quiet. The decision now falls on us to appoint a new lead, one superior to the previous. If we choose the correct leader for the job, we can drive the project of nuclearisation forward that much quicker.

ITAOIL.2.d:0 "Oil is not a resource like any other. An abundance of it can create a nation where none existed, prop up an army without any other loyalty and pave a road through the desert. A lack of it can crush empires.\n\nThe crisis in the Middle East has threatened Italy's oil, and subsequently, the Italian Empire itself, not to mention the living standards of millions of Italian families. Whilst the geopolitics of the Middle East are incredibly complex, we must involve ourselves in the evolving crisis lest it go against our interests and in doing so, threaten the existence of the Fascist regime itself. Whatever we must do, whoever we must work with, we shall do so without hesitation."

ITAOIL.10.t:0 "Economic Slowdown" # economy is slowing down 
ITAOIL.10.d:0 "While the Italian economy has never been in the best of shape ever since the Atlantropa project drastically curtailed our trade, recent events in the Middle East have not had an encouraging effect. Uncertainty in the markets, coupled with rapidly rising oil prices, and unrest in our sphere of influence has slowed the economy to a crawl.\n\nAs long lines begin to appear around gas stations, and shareholders sell off stocks, the first cracks have started to appear. It is evident that the current crisis in the Middle East must be dealt with, and soon before it sends our Empire crashing into the doldrums of an economic depression."

ITAOIL.11.d:0 "The oil crisis has severely hit our country's economy. Therefore, the government is proposing emergency measures to balance the budget.

This is needed to stabilize the region and get the top suppliers of oil in the world running again. In the first few months of these proxy wars, we have seen little domestic opposition to these interventions. However, we are starting to get reports of protests around the country, advocating for no more intervention. We must end these conflicts quickly, or start dealing with these protests. If we do not, the country might turn against us and we can no longer try to reassert our control over the Middle East. "

ITAOIL.100.d:0 "For a while now the best minds in our propaganda departments have worked to justify Italy's involvement in what is, at its heart, an oil war. In doing this we have used every trick in the book - arguing for national interest, for doing the right thing, and for getting involved before our enemies can. These efforts have paid off, and we are seeing a general mobilisation of public opinion in favour of Italy getting involved in the war. Having the people behind us will be crucial in the days ahead."

ITAOIL.101.d:0 "Our best minds in the propaganda departments have worked to justify Italy's involvement in the Oil War, but for whatever reason, barely a ripple has been felt on the public consciousness. Arguments which work have been met with arguments to the contrary, and while Italian are not against our involvement in the war, they are not really in favour of it either. In short, our propaganda efforts have had little to no effect, and should we go to war, we will do so in the name of an apathetic nation whose imagination has not been captured."

ITAOIL.102.d:0 "We have attempted to mobilise the public in favour of involvement in the Oil War, but these efforts have more than failed - they have actually done significant harm. Our public opinion czars now tell us that Italians are more cynical than ever, seeing involvement in the war to be a waste of lives, resources and time which harms them directly. We need not necessarily act according to this, of course, but to go against the public will not be without cost. Perhaps it would have been better to keep quiet altogether."

ITAOIL.105.d:0 "Our efforts have borne fruit. After an intensive propaganda campaign aimed at spinning the narrative in our favour, showing the people that our cause in the war is just, we are informed that the Italian public has rallied in favour of war. Whether they believe the war is glorious or a tragic necessity is another thing, but as we have so forcefully explained, we are in the right, and that is enough. Those who decry another imperialist war or claim that peace would be better are ignored or treated as fools. What is important is that the facts on the ground are known by all, and that the just war goes on - why argue with lone voices in the desert?"
ITAOIL.105.a:0 "We fight because we must."

ITAOIL.106.t:0 "Their hearts and minds are lost" # Failure on spinning the narrative, many civilians believe this is just another imperialist war, even though we're in the right 
ITAOIL.106.d:0 "Our efforts have been in vain. After an intensive propaganda campaign on the matter of the war, aimed at showing the people that our cause is just, we are informed that the Italian public simply does not believe we are in the right. Whether they say so in the street or behind closed doors, Italians are largely united in seeing our effort as yet another imperialist war. We shall continue trying to show them they are wrong, but now their mind is made up, there is little we can do. We must grit our teeth and carry on, despite our people's cynicism and their pig-headedness."

There government officials explained that the government was dealing with the situation. That any disruption in the oil situation was expected to be temporary and that the government was already enacting its plans for the crisis. Any followup questions were, of course, met with the response that the government had the situation well in hand but that state secrets regarding military affairs in the Middle-East were, for obvious reasons, not up for disclosure.

Most of our diplomatic experts believe such a deal could be workable, yet a good number of them are skeptics. However pragmatic the Dawa leaders are, they remind us, these men view no step as too far in achieving their objectives.

For it is not enough to bury Fascism. Now we must build everyday what it means to be independent and free, and reap the benefit from opening up to all those of goodwill.

For Japan and the US, despite their assurances of benevolence and friendship, are clear in their intent. Both see themselves as a first rate power attempting to gain influence over a second rate one.

#Ciano Democratization Events#

demitaly.40.t:0 "An Address to the Grand Council" # Ciano speaks to the grand council of fascism alongside Umberto, Umberto is clearly making Ciano speak in this manner but Ciano covers that with the results in Verona, the nation will be following a different path. Many members agree with him, notably Amintore Fanfani who has been eyeing Umberto's talking points on democracy.
demitaly.40.d:0 "Galeazzo Ciano smiled with his mouth, but not with his eyes. He had come into the chamber with King Umberto, and as the men present stood to attention Ciano paid notice to the way they addressed the monarch, bowing their head slightly as they shook his hand or making eye contact. Their respect for the King, or lack thereof, would make a big difference in their opinion of what Ciano had to say. At best, everyone present would go along with what was said, and at worst they would leave the room with reservations, which would set things back significantly.\n\nThe Duce spoke at some length, going over the talking points presented to him by the King. Democratisation would be complex and fragile, even with the systems and handover to be put in place, because to his knowledge no country had ever transitioned from Fascism to democracy. Verona had changed things for the better, Ciano said to the men present, trying to will himself to believe it. He had the full support of the King in saying this. To continue as things were before would be to risk a continuing stagnation and the dissolution of Italy's status in the world, rendering it a second rate power forever to be picked at by greater nations. Something had to give, and that something was the Fascist system designed by Mussolini for a time long past. Ciano scanned the faces of his audience. Amintore Fanfani's eyes gleamed as he listened. The man's smile was unnerving. He was not alone, and many of those present nodded solemnly. Others looked on unmoved, with faces which betrayed disappointment but not surprise. Yet no one interrupted.\n\nOnce he was finished, and had given a few curt instructions, the Duce followed King Umberto out of the room. Out of earshot of the others, the King grasped his hands in his own. "Well done," he said simply, beaming. Ciano returned the smile. Yet once more it was in his mouth, not his eyes."
demitaly.40.a:0 "Many sleepless nights to come."

demitaly.41.t:0 "The Christian Democrats Prepare" # The Christian Democrats! Seemingly the most popular party, though Ciano may wish for a more conservative party, Umberto on Ciano's side is happy to see the contenders in the upcoming election
demitaly.41.d:0 "According to our sources, the Christian Democrats are preparing for a contentious electoral campaign. Everything indicates that this coalition, a moderate grouping of centrists, democrats and conservative elements bound by an idea of Catholic politics, will win power once the election arrives.\n\nThe Duce is not entirely pleased with their ideas, seeing them as too conciliatory to moderate leftist voters, but King Umberto is reportedly a firm supporter. Whether they will manage to push their advantage and implement their ideas remains to be seen."
demitaly.41.a:0 "Let's see what the favourites can do."

demitaly.42.t:0 "Meeting with the Parties" # Umberto meets with numerous factions in one day, he's tired out but still giddy about the reformation of the Italian system
demitaly.42.d:0 "Umberto II was tired, but happy. As he sat down to have something to eat - dining alone for the first time in days - he reflected on the meetings with the political factions of the past few days.\n\nAll those who came to meet him had been respectful and, with a couple of exceptions, seemed intelligent enough. The Monarchists were, as expected, almost embarrassingly earnest in their professions of undying loyalty. The Christian Democrats were particularly interesting conversation partners, genuinely soliciting his views on a number of issues and then providing their own ideas. Aldo Moro had something of a radiant quality about him, with the quiet confidence of a man who knows he is the favourite to lead his country into democracy. The socialists were more courteous than he expected, with Pietro Nenni speaking at length and then observing the King carefully for his reaction. Umberto was under no illusions as to the republicans among their ranks, but Nenni artfully steered the conversation elsewhere whenever the King raised the issue. Of Almirante, with his ties to the PNF and his known views, he did not know what to make entirely. Yet the man was charismatic, even if he was the quietest of all the politicians he had spoken with over the past days.\n\nUmberto could be proud of what he had achieved. Italy would democratise, whatever the regressive elements among the PNF had to say about it. And he would be there to see it through."
demitaly.42.a:0 "A firm hand to lead Italy to freedom."

demitaly.43.t:0 "The Democratic Front's Hopes"
demitaly.43.d:0 "The left bloc is ready. For forty years they have survived on nothing but the hope of eventually abolishing Fascism and establishing a worker's government in Italy, and now that Fascism is withering away, they see this as a matter of fate. Their leader, Nenni, has moderated his socialist views to become more acceptable to the middling body of the Italian electorate. Time will tell whether this strategy will pay off, and whether the renewed hopes of the socialists, some of whom have only returned from exile recently, will bear fruit."
demitaly.43.a:0 "The workers of Italy hold their breath."

demitaly.44.t:0 "A Roundtable of Parties" # Meetings with all of the democratic leaders, they do thing alongside fascists who are worried about the complete upheaval of the system, Ciano is a mediator with sympathies to the fascists while Umberto is there on side of the democrats
demitaly.44.d:0 "Ciano rubbed the tiredness from his eyelids and looked up."If there is nothing more to add," he said. "I propose that we bring this meeting to a close. And thank you, gentlemen, for agreeing to come here on such short notice." But someone cleared his throat, and Ciano raised his head wearily. "Would you like to speak?" The person who interrupted did speak, at length, and Ciano actively stopped himself from nodding along. It was a grand old man representing the PNF interests, though not a party man himself. The democratic leaders that, at this meeting, only parties intending to run for election and civil servants of importance could attend. This had led to the awkward situation of a group of nominally independent civil servants speaking in defence of the PNF.\n\nIn any case, the PNF's man rambled on. He spoke about the threat to stability, of moving too quickly and throwing out the good of Fascism with the bad, and of letting down the hardworking members of the civil service through an imperfect democratisation. Ciano remembered the King, and held his tongue. He was here to mediate, and was determined not to give any of the Blocs - the right wingers, the Christian Democrats or the Left - cause to say he had been unfair. Ciano was sympathetic to the gentleman's points, he said carefully. Certainly democratisation would not occur at any cost and would not throw away everything of use. He was certain the party leaders agreed also on this - Ciano felt them getting angsty, with Nenni bursting to speak. Yet they should not be afraid, added Ciano quickly, to strike forth. No democratisation process could be perfect, and that should not strain their will to make the necessary change. With respect to the esteemed gentleman, who he knew to be an excellent leader of men and servant to his country, there would be no change to the plans. Ciano felt an audible shudder as he said this. He was starting to sound like the King.\n\nThe King himself congratulated him after the meeting, through his private secretary. "Do not let the short sighted hold back what is best for your country," said the man to him before slipping away. The Duce returned to his office, fighting the lingering uncertainty in his gut, and shut the door."
demitaly.44.a:0 "Just fifteen minutes before the next meeting.. "


demitaly.45.t:0 "The Gift of Democracy" # On to the next set of reforms! With a democratic system worked out, it seems democracy may be a gift that others will see soon, Ciano really is on the fence, but Umberto is still happy.
demitaly.45.d:0 "It was almost complete - the project that would be Umberto's legacy and that of Ciano, whether the latter was proud of the distinction or not. A workable democratic system and carefully planned out methodology for the transition had been plotted out. Now all that was left was to wait, in the unbearable silence that moments such as this carried, and hope for the best. The King had decided he would spend the moment on his own to the best of his ability. When he managed to get away from his hangers-on he lingered in a balcony, looking out over his Rome as the lights of the evening began to turn on. It was always beautiful, the most beautiful city on earth - thought the King - and today it would change for the better, although you would not know to look at it. Despite Ciano's doubts, which he continued to express to His Majesty even today, Umberto had faith in his people. Forty years ago his father had given Mussolini the keys to power, and now the son would return those keys to the people, to do with them whatever they chose. Perhaps they would choose wrong, but Umberto had more faith in them than that. They had received the gift of democracy, and whatever happened next that meant something."
demitaly.45.a:0 "The King stayed to look down onto his city until it grew dark."

#Hot Autumn Events#
hotautumn.1.t:0 "Strike at FIAT!"
hotautumn.1.d:0 "The city of Turin woke up to another day of work - the most important industrial centre of northwestern Italy prepared to see the trams scuttle around the city, filled with men and women heading to their jobs, the smokestacks start to emit their dark columns of smoke, and the middle and upper classes were heading to their comfortable jobs at the many, many factories of the city. And yet, this was not to be another day of work - a strike of FIAT workers was scheduled for the day. Per se, this was not a rare occurrence - numerous strikes had been held during the summer, usually starting and ending in the span of twenty-four hours and controlled by one of the major trade unions, CGIL, CISL and UIL. And yet, this time it was different.\n\nInside FIAT, tensions had been rising for a long time. Dissatisfaction with the trade unions, viewed as bureaucratic, inefficient and all too eager to compromise with the employers, was creeping among the workers, and the continued prosperity of Italy seemed to bless everyone with its golden touch, except the many working class families of Turin and other working class cities. Rent and commodities became more costly and yet wages remained the same, the working hours were long and extenuating, and contracts were always at risk of being rescinded for mysterious and inscrutable reasons, at the whim of those sitting in the offices upstairs. Frustration turned into resentment, and resentment quickly became anger when FIAT announced that numerous contracts would not be renovated at the end of the year, resulting in many workers losing their jobs.\n\nWhen the strike began, it took everyone by surprise. FIAT, the largest car factory of Italy and one of the most important in the country, ground to a halt. The strikes spread like wildfire to numerous other factories across Turin, and it became clear that they wouldn't end at dawn. In the span of a few days, numerous impromptu workers' organizations and committees were formed, declaring an all-out strike. One of the most important industrial hubs of the country was shut down. Of course, the police were quick to mobilize to prevent the strikes from turning into riots, and the trade unions hurried to retake control of the situation. For now, the air is tense, and nobody knows how the situation will develop."
hotautumn.1.a:0 "We can surely talk this out."

hotautumn.2.t:0 "Strikes Spread Across the Country!"
hotautumn.2.d:0 "In the days following the proclamation of the strike at FIAT, many began to realize that Turin was merely the first spark in the tinderbox. Soon, similar strikes were announced in the other major industrial centres of northern Italy, Milan. The working class district of Bicocca, in the northeast of the city, home to numerous important factories such as Pirelli, became the location of numerous strikes and worker protests. The strikes were so prominent and widespread that even the most reluctant trade union, CISL, was tentatively forced to support them for fear of backlash, and the central committees of UIL and CGIL have released a statement giving full support to the strikes.\n\nThe emergency isn't limited to Milan either - Genoa, Florence, Rome, Taranto, and every other industrial city in Italy, even smaller towns, are beginning to flare up with strikes. Every working class sector is involved, from steel mill workers to railway workers, and even other categories such as schoolteachers and nurses are beginning to set up strikes of their own, as the snowball is rapidly picking up speed and size. Their demands are as varied as the many groups they come from, ranging from more stable contracts to better wages and reduced work hours.\n\nWith the police deployed at most locations where the strikes are taking place, the government is confident that no other direct intervention is necessary, and with the trade unions now regaining control of the situation, it's only a matter of time before negotiations begin between the unions and the employers. While they will of course be forced to make concessions, a deal will surely be found in the end, and while many in government are worried about communist or extremist infiltration, a direct intervention from the government could easily do more harm than good."
hotautumn.2.a:0 "This is a sign of a healthy economy."

hotautumn.3.t:0 "The Strike Escalates!"
hotautumn.3.d:0 "It seems like the early hopes for a peaceful resolution to the strikes are being dashed one by one, as strikes around the country escalate in violence and demands. Workers' control of the factories and workplace democracy are only some of the demands and slogans that are starting to be chanted - in Milan, workers attempted to violently occupy the Pirelli factory and were stopped by a police cordon, and in Turin, clashes with the police began after the workers started to accuse the police of being "fascist dogs". The most worrying development of all, which has exacerbated the situation further, is that it seems like communist agitators coming from universities and other youth movements are infiltrating and becoming influential among the striking workers.\n\nCommunist red banners are being raised in marches and protests, as students and workers march together. Universities are once again becoming inflamed with riots of their own, and frequent police sweeps barely seem to amend the problem, as law enforcement forces are starting to be stretched thin in numerous cities. Communist groups are once again starting to occupy classrooms and even entire buildings of universities, and the reaction from fascist groups has infallibly caused numerous clashes among students, some of which resulted in serious injuries and deaths.\n\nPolitics is, as always, divided and torn on how to deal with the issue. Representatives from Democrazia Cristiana have argued that the government should act as a mediator between employers and trade unions to quickly resolve tensions, while the Fronte Democratico has proposed enforcing the demands of the trade unions to safeguard the Italian worker. Finally, the Blocchi Nazionali have warned about the ever present communist menace, and have demanded a hardline stance against the red snakes that crawl in the underbelly of the Italian cities. With the government so bitterly divided, the situation seems more unstable than ever, and with no hope of a quick and peaceful resolution in sight, the Italian economy has started to suffer too."
hotautumn.3.a:0 "This is terrible!"

hotautumn.4.t:0 "FUAN Tries to Occupy the Statale"
hotautumn.4.d:0 "The situation in Milan, already plagued by strikes and riots, has further deteriorated. Following a major clash between right wing and left wing students, the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale, Italy's major right wing student organization, has attempted to occupy a few classrooms in Milan's university, the Statale. Barricading themselves in, the students of FUAN have employed their advantageous position to repel the assaults of their left wing counterparts who attempted to dislodge them. In response, various left wing student groups have declared occupations of their own, and the Statale has been turned into a warzone.\n\nClashes have been violent and relentless, with bottles and rocks being flung by both sides and bloody confrontations happening with crowbars and wrenches being used as weapons. The university's rector has attempted to negotiate with the students to attempt to calm things down, but it appears like his efforts are going to be fruitless. The police have already cordoned the university, and an intervention might be only hours away.\n\nNo comment has arrived from the leaders of FUAN and the representatives of the Blocchi Nazionali, the coalition FUAN is associated with - this leads many to believe that the situation has deteriorated because of radicals within the organization acting independently from their superiors. The chaos at the Statale is only yet another step of Milan's descent into chaos, and many worry that anarchy will soon spread to other universities of Italy, as it did during last spring."
hotautumn.4.a:0 "This is madness! Madness!"

hotautumn.5.t:0 "The Police Clears Out the Statale"
hotautumn.5.d:0 "Following recent events, the rector of the Statale has issued a formal plea for help to the Polizia di Stato and the authorities, asking them to restore order in the university. With any semblance of negotiations breaking down, the police charged into the university, flushing out the students from the university and its surroundings using copious amounts of tear gas, batons and water cannons. Both FUAN and left wing students have been targeted by police, leading to some condemnation coming from many political representatives regarding perceived brutality.\n\nNumerous students have been gravely wounded following the police action, with dozens of them taken into custody by police. Numerous dangerous weapons, including makeshift bombs and a few guns, have been seized, but this new crackdown has done little to defuse tensions - both sides, leftists and neo fascists, accuse the other of collaborating with the police, and the political debate is only getting more heated, as leftist politicians accuse the Blocchi Nazionali of harboring neofascism and radicalism in FUAN while BN politicians accuse the Fronte Democratico to allow communist infiltration in student groups close to their coalition.\n\nWhile the university has been pacified for now, the streets of Milan remain chaotic. Numerous students from leftist groups have now left the universities and are actively agitating the striking workers, spreading communist propaganda and calling for unity between workers and students to change the system. Meanwhile, the city's right wing has not sat idle - local sections of the BN have expressed their condemnation of communist violence in the city and have announced that they won't stand idly while the reds attempt to overtake Milan with the police and the politicians' complacency."

hotautumn.6.desc:0 "Autumn has begun, and it's not an ordinary season. Everywhere in the country it feels like a subterranean fire is rising, its excruciating heat boiling the atmosphere from the very depths of the earth. An entire town in Campania revolted over a factory being closed; Padova's university has become the theatre of occupations and clashes; numerous left wing associations and local party headquarters in Milan have been firebombed; fascist students have been attacked and given a bloody beating by communist ambushes; and the strikes, all over the country, are only getting bigger.\n\nThe Hot Autumn is upon us, a grand opera of tragedy and conflict. Many are those with stakes in the struggle, and many are being swept into this hot, searing wind that is blowing over Italy. A worker, striking for a fairer job that will let him care for his family in peace; a representative of a Catholic trade union, who sees the world around him slowly consumed by flames; a young idealistic neofascist, who with his fellow students hope to bring Italy back on the right track; and a police officer, standing on the thin line between anarchy and repression.\n\nAll of their stories intertwine, meeting and abandoning each other, as the threads of human lives do. But each and every one of us can only follow one thread in our mortal lives - and so a choice must be made between one of these four crossed destinies."

hotautumn.7.d:0 "The news arrived like a blast of icy wind. Written in a cold, matter of factly language, the same communique was delivered to dozens and dozens of workers and employees at the large Pirelli industrial complex, a behemoth of smokestacks and work sheds dominating the Bicocca suburb of Milano. The job contracts that were supposed to last for at least another two years had been rescinded, and will be renegotiated - numerous workers were being laid off as the industry was being restructured - pension plans might be in jeopardy - wages will be rediscussed, and likely cut.\n\nMario Calabrò received the very same letter from the hands of a foreman. Reading it in the dim light of his apartment, his wife by his side, as the kids were already asleep. His family, his house, all were now at risk. If he were to be laid off, there was no other option - they would have to move back to Mario's home town, in the deep South. Milano was a mirage - a promise of work for everyone which had attracted many people like him, hoping to escape the poverty of the rural Italian south. Milano was an alluring monster - chewing people and devouring them whole after a lifetime of backbreaking work in the factories.\n\nIt didn't take long for a reaction to blow up, especially with strikes already underway in Turin. At first timidly, labour associations and trade unions announced their intention to protest - the first banners were hanged, the first strikes began. The leaders of Pirelli, captains of finance and shining examples of Italian industriousness, reassured that everything would turn out fine and that contracts would soon be renewed. Still, the situation was already largely out of Pirelli's control, and when the vast majority of factory workers in Bicocca crossed their arms in a strike, Mario was among them."

hotautumn.8.d:0 "In all truth, Mario Calabró had never intended to be part of the demonstration in Bicocca that night, although it was also true that his sympathies were firmly on the side of those assorted laborers, students, and even teachers who made up the bulk of the group. He had previously joined similar events over the past few weeks after learning just how precarious his employment situation was. All the same however, on that cool night Mario Calabró, long-suffering factory worker, was only interested in returning home to his family as quickly as possible. That was why he, in a decision that was made so quickly the man himself did not even consciously process it, chose to take a route home that was supposed to be ever so slightly shorter. That choice to shave a few minutes off of his nightly commute would prove to be the most significant of his life.\n\nHe started hearing the shouts two blocks out after leaving the factory. At that moment, he could have changed his mind and gone his regular route, or he could have made another detour using some third way to avoid any unpleasantness. He chose neither option because, as he reasoned to himself as he walked along the sidewalk with his lunch pail dangling at his side, it was likely a noisy but relatively small gathering of his fellow workers and he could easily cross to the other side of the street and continue unimpeded. He wanted to catch his children before they went to bed, and to do that, he needed to move quickly. He had been working longer and longer hours recently with the economic troubles and he was seeing his family less and less. To a devoted family man such as he, such an arrangement was frustrating to the point of maddening but he had no alternatives if he wished to keep his job.\n\nHe ought to have been tipped off to the reality of the situation when the noise kept increasing the entire time he walked, but his concentration on arriving back to his home as soon as possible was damoening his perception of the outside world. That was why he was stunned to discover that instead of the few grizzled factory workers and fresh-faced students he had been expecting there was a veritable horde of angry protestors choking up the street. It only took a single sweep of the grim, determined faces for Mario to realize that he had just walked into the beginnings of the kind of riot that can shake the course of a nation."

hotautumn.10.d:0 "There were many things Mario expected from striking, such as police opposition or even fascists countering them. However, he never expected that college students would join them spontaneously. In almost the blink of an eye, Mario went from being surrounded by his fellow workers to being surrounded by strangers who waved communist banners and sang revolutionary songs.\n\nIt was almost surreal, having communist university students walk side by side with men who had fought the USSR. Mario found himself talking to one of the students, a girl from Torino named Anna, and found something surprising. Unlike how the communists seemed to be portrayed, the girl was surprisingly eloquent, and she did not constantly speak about the bloody murder of all the bosses in Italy. It was a stark contrast from the communists at Biocca and Pirelli, who tended to be much more aggressive in their methods.\n\nHowever, before Mario could ask Anna to elaborate more on some of her views, they were separated by more groups joining the strike. While this strike had once merely included factory workers, it now held nurses, teachers, students, and so many more different types of people. Mario felt inspired. People from completely different walks of life were joining their strike, people that Mario would've never interacted with otherwise. They were all united, chanting slogans, waving revolutionary banners, and singing songs which undoubtedly made old Mussolini turn in his grave. Maybe there was hope after all for him and his family."

hotautumn.11.d:0 "Throughout his whole life, Mario had never attended political meetings. He'd never been the most political man, so attending a meeting of communist students, of all things, was a brand new thing for him. Mario felt out of place, to an extent. While there were a few people there his age or older, the majority of the attendees were in their 20s - some seemingly even younger. Red flags and banners calling for proletarian - student unity were draped on the walls, as scrawny kids sporting red handkerchiefs and wide smiles exchanged talks with big, brawny steel mill workers.\n\nSoon enough, one of said scrawny kids, wearing a big pair of glasses and an eskimo jacket, took the floor - but his words were soon enough to convince everybody in the room that he was no ordinary youth. "We are here today because we are united in a common struggle. The Italian working classes and the Italian students share a common goal, but moreover, they share a common enemy - the ruling classes, the padroni. Your bosses are the same people who, a few scant years ago, gloated at the sight of blackshirts marching in the streets, saluting them as they beat up, incarcerated, and tortured the proletarians who dared raise their heads against the regime."\n\n"Now, the same thing is happening once again. All over Italy, the working class is once more locked in a deadly struggle with their bosses - with the only slight change that this time, your bosses hide under a facade of democracy as they beat up, incarcerate and torture those who defy them. The politicians representing you used to be fascist bureaucrats and supporters! Do not be deceived, my comrades - ours is not a democracy, for democracy cannot be handed down by those who rule from above. Democracy is won in a struggle - a struggle we must be organized, prepared for, a struggle we must win at every cost! Democracy is a rifle on the shoulder of the worker!""

He had always brushed them off as radicals who should be ignored. However, Mario saw it all in a different light now, for he had seen the possibility of a future where the world could truly be free. He had hope of a time where there would be no more nights where he went to bed hungry, no more times when him and his family were destitute. That glimpse of a possible future, however small it may be, was worth pursuing in the mind of Mario.\n\nThe dream of revolution grew not only in Mario's mind, but in the minds of many members of the Fronte Democratico. The communists, once only a small subsection of the party, grew like wildfire. The rank and file grew more and more attracted to these radical ideas, and the moderates of the FD were drawn into more and more bitter conflicts with the radical leftists than ever before. These conflicts, as the Hot Autumn raged on, would only weaken the unity of the party."

Armored vans, horses, shields, batons, guns. "They're going all out on this one" said a kid who couldn't have been older than seventeen, spitting on the ground. "They're scared." Calabrò looked to the other side of the square - what seemed like a ragtag assortment of striking workers, angry students, even a few women. Some carried signs wishing death to the ruling classes, others hid zhdanovs under their coats, possibly with the hope of giving a bit more credibility to that threat.\n\nThe standoff lasted for around four hours. Bottles and rocks were hurled at the police - the police fired back with tear gas. Calabrò felt the burning rise up his nostrils before he was handed a handkerchief soaked in water, and he wrapped it around his mouth and nose as he saw a young girl climb up the barricades and throw a rock at a cop who had advanced a bit too close. Hit on his head, he fell to the ground before being carried back behind the ranks as the policemen regrouped. When the police charge finally happened, the protestors all fled through side alleys, leaving battered barricades and a few burning cars behind. Calabrò finally got home, dirty, broken and exhausted."

hotautumn.14.d:0 "Mario wanted desperately to embrace the idealism of these students, of their communist ideology. However, he knew it was impossible. Political and social equality sounded great, but actually achieving these goals would be nearly impossible, especially considering that the Italian government would fight tooth and nail against communist revolutionaries. The idealism of the students was infectious, but Mario had inoculated himself. He would strike, yes, but he would strike only for bread, and not anything more.\n\nMario's rejection of communism and radicalism was not unique. All throughout the Fronte Democratico, the moderate leftists and the rank and file workers rejected the call of communism, and the voices of the radicals were isolated more and more as fewer and fewer people listened to them. The revolutionary ideals of the communists gave way to the rational pragmatism of the moderates, unifying the party under the cause of bread."

In an orderly manner, the workers and representatives of the unions - CGIL, CISL and UIL - marched on the streets, shouting their slogans, waving their flags, displaying their banners, and loudly proclaiming their demands to the seemingly uncaring buildings and streets of the city. Calabrò took part in this wholesome endeavour - he shouted and shouted like the others did, and yet nobody seemed to answer. Even the long cordons of police seemed bored, and rather annoyed at most.\n\nAt the end of the day, a representative from a union, perhaps CGIL, addressed the workers. "Workers, comrades, what we are pursuing here is not utopias - we are building the foundation for a better life! A fairer pay! A safer workplace! And as we exercise our hard won democratic right to protest, we are assured that the government will need to heed our requests! Soon, things will change!" Calabrò, like the others, shouted and cheered at the news. Many other marches, many other protests like that one would take place - making the same demands, asking for the same things, always speaking to the same uncaring faces of policemen, buildings and streets."

hotautumn.16.d:0 "Milano is a big city - and despite this, news still spread fast. Some say that the idea of the rally was first proposed by student groups, then passed on to small, independent unions. From there, it snowballed. Steel workers, farmers, miners, nurses, teachers, soon enough association after association announced they'd show up. Finally, the big ones - CGIL, CISL and UIL all announced they would take part in the rally, likely out of fear of losing every little crumb of credibility they had left. And soon enough, everybody seemed to be heading for Rome.\n\nThe government had been cautious - some urged for letting the protest happen, others demanded it shut down. Eventually, to ease tensions, the mass strike was allowed to happen, with an extraordinarily large police and military deployment. Milano, Torino, Taranto, Genova, the centres of insurrection had seemed to slow down - as everybody was busy preparing for what was to come. Signs were made, bigger than ever - new slogans were crafted, catchier and more appealing - meetings were held, speeches written, fists raised.\n\nCalabrò was not enthusiastic about the idea of the rally at first. The train ticket was costly, but then a friend of his, with contacts in CGIL, offered him a free one. He was afraid his wife would complain, but she actually encouraged him to go, even tentatively smiling. All his friends and colleagues were planning to go. After all, a little bit of hope never hurt anybody."

hotautumn.17.d:0 "This time, it was different. This time, the crowd was bigger, far bigger than any crowd most people there had ever seen before. This time, the shouts of the thousands of workers, students, women, elderly men, former political exiles, immigrants, ex colonial subjects, homosexuals, idealists, dreamers, fighters, all the oppressed, the shunned, the weak - their shouts echoed in the very halls that had held up the foundations of the Italian state ever since it was conceived. The Fori Imperiali echoed with the cries of the downtrodden - and the ancient stones answered with silence.\n\nIn response, the state was not afraid to flex its muscles. Tanks, APCs, armed soldiers, entire phalanxes of policemen and Carabinieri armed to the teeth, even some helicopters circling the skies of the Eternal City. There were many moments in which the crowd was about to erupt into violence - as if a spark would be enough to set Rome ablaze. But that spark never came. The rally came and went, shouting its cries into the halls of power - and the halls of power answered with silence.\n\nIn the end, politicians climbed their stages, as they always do. Promising solutions, promising that the people's voice has been heard. A few years ago, when the country was hopefully looking at a new future, this would have worked. Now, one crucial thing changed - once silenced, the Italian people were allowed to have a voice, and it was learning to use it too. Now, many were starting to learn that a voice wouldn't be enough, and more incisive methods were needed to make a point. Young leftists were ever more disillusioned. Frustrated. Angry."

hotautumn.18.d:0 ""It sounds like a waste of time to me." These men in their fancy suits and combed hair provided stark contrast to Mario's own light blue denim clothing. He normally wouldn't wear his protective gear outside of work, but someone had suggested it might make a statement when the union representatives arrived. Instead, he just felt silly, sitting at this desk in front of these suits.\n\n"I assure you, Mister Calabrò..." The head suit reassured the steel worker as he already had so frequently in this conversation. "It will be most beneficial, to both the union and to the workers who make up the union.." He gestured towards Mario. "Such as yourself."\n\nMario Calabrò had his arms crossed over his chest in quiet, but weakening defiance. "There's more important things going on. What would a debate solve? Much less a debate between union boys. Just... Have your debate, why should we care?"\n\n"Transparency, Mister Calabrò. Transparency, participation of the workers in the affairs of the union, expanding your perspective... You ask why you and people like you should care, I ask you instead, why shouldn't you?" The representative leaned back in his chair at the end of his explanation.\n\nThe two sat in silence for an uncomfortably long amount of time, though the Union Suit sure didn't seem all that disquieted as Mario mulled over the offer in his head. With a final sigh, he let his shoulders slump. "How long do you expect it to take?""
hotautumn.18.a:0 "An hour, two at most."

hotautumn.20.t:0 "Roundtable with the Workers"
hotautumn.20.d:0 "The steel workers had their collective suspicions going into this, but they had to admit, it was certainly more entertaining than they had expected. The suits up on the stage had debated things like union policy, union dues, and issues facing the CISL itself. Really, it was enough to put the most politicized laborer right to sleep, that is, until the topic of reaching out to the other unions came around.\n\nThe CISL might be considered radical by Italy as a whole, but they were nothing compared to the outright socialists and communists in the CGIL. There was bad blood between the CISL, who looked to reform the system, and the CGIL, who advocated tearing it all down and starting anew. So, the yawning and droopy-eyed audience began to blink and sit up straight when the mediators asked the fancy suit men as to whether or not the union should join forces with the CGIL.\n\n"We broke off from the radicals for a damn good reason!" The suit sitting furthest to the right was making a real show of this. He might not have, had his compatriots seated on the other side of the forum admitted to understanding some of the benefits of such an alliance. "If they'd had their way, they'd have forced us into this crisis long ago!"\n\n"The need for solidarity and unity supersedes individual political disagreements in times like these!" One of the other speakers- the most eager among them to work with the communists, notably- rose to the defense of the idea. "If we back down and negotiate with the corporations now, they'll think that the working class can be easily bullied! Pushed around!"\n\n"So you would sell the worker's soul to the rabid communists instead?"\n\n"The only soul on sale here sir, is your own."\n\nThe crowd listened, and as the voices lowered and the fire and fury cooled, a prevailing attitude took hold of the crowd. The people cry out with one voice, and they say..."

hotautumn.21.d:0 "The debate all but ended there, though like with most things related to the union suits, it took a good while for the debate itself to figure that out. In the end, the men in suits shook hands, some murmured words between each other, and went their separate ways. The speaker who railed against an alliance with the CGIL took one last look over the crowd who had been swayed significantly in the other direction.\n\nMany workers had walked into that meeting hall without much of a mind to the upcoming Union elections, but by the time he left, he had decided. He'd stop by the union offices next week, and the CISL would hear what he had to say.\n\nWhat made them so different from a CGIL auto worker? He didn't join this Union for the politics, for the purity of its ideologues or any of its particularly high-minded ideals beyond what they said they stood for. The rights and privileges of the average worker, and how could that be achieved if they refused to work together?\n\nAnd so, when the time came to vote, he'd vote for solidarity and not division. A united general strike was a strong general strike, and the parliament up in Rome would certainly have to listen to them. Social Democrat, Christian Democrat, Socialist, Communist, what difference did it make when wages were low for all of those workers, regardless of their personal political inclinations? This fight was the fight for all workers, for all laborers, and he was part of the whole, weren't they?\n\nFrancesco's debate appeared to be a success, and Mario walked away from the debates with a greater sense of solidarity with his fellow worker than ever before. Should CGIL agree to it, they and CISL would stand, linked arm in arm, and the unions would in turn lock arms with the workers they represented, both those unionized and otherwise."

hotautumn.22.t:0 "The Unions Unite"
hotautumn.22.d:0 "CISL reaching out to CGIL was only the first step into forming a broad coalition for all workers. The radicals in the CGIL were nothing if not unpredictable. The union was made up of far leftists- communists and socialists, some even whispered that some anarchists were connected to the Union as well, though that was simple gossip. They were revolutionaries- both of the violent and voting sorts- and revolutionaries were hot of head and quick to anger, everyone knew. Would they react favorably to the offer? Would bad blood get in the way of progress?\n\nFrancesco Inceli leaned forward, hands steepled together, foot tapping rapidly on the ground. He was already running disaster scenarios through his head. CISL had been less than eager to join in on the General Strike than CGIL was, and even the UIL seemed more enthusiastic about it than CISL had been. Could they go to the UIL if the CGIL refused them? Or perhaps they could spin a refusal to earn the attention of their workers somehow... If only...\n\nMario Callabrò sat back in his chair, arms crossed over his chest. It was time to see just how dedicated to the cause these Socialists were. Would they put aside their personal grievances to join forces with him, and men like him? He didn't see any harm in their alliance if it went through, but why should it bother him- or anyone like him- if the communists would not work with them? They could do this on their own, but it would be better to do it together, even a blind man could see that.\n\nThen, the doors opened, and three figures stepped into the room, practically flying on their feet. The first figure had a CISL pin on his chest, and stepped to the side with a wide smile on his face. The second, a pin with the CGIL symbol proudly placed on his own chest, practically swept into the room, walking right up to Francesco who was still standing up. The third entered at a much more relaxed pace, leaning against the doorframe.\n\nOnce face to face with Mister Inceli, the CGIL representative wasted no words, instead he grabbed the man's hand with a firm grip, and pressed his lips to Francesco's cheek, a display that caught the CISL rep off-guard, much to the amusement of the workers that filled the room behind them. "We are told that you are the man to thank, Mister Inceli!"\n\nFrancesco blinked as he recovered his senses. He looked around the room, and then past the Communist representative. "We?"\n\nThe last man stepped through the door frame, his UIL pin becoming visible in the light of the room. He extended a hand towards Francesco Inceli and smiled faintly.

Francesco never thought he'd see the day. He never thought he'd want to be part of it either, he recalled- with a little bit of shame admittedly- how he'd rail against communism and socialism when he was younger, when Virgilio was still just a tyke. Oh, he never thought that the people were anything more than idiots duped into a system that was incapable of standing up to pressure of any sort. But then he spoke here today, he spoke of the disparity of wealth between the working man and the rich man. He spoke of safety regulations and the insane expectations placed on workers for their productivity. And when he looked among the masses gathered before him, he could not tell who was a Socialist and who was not. When he waved his goodbyes to the crowd to make room for the next speaker, all of the workers made their approval known. Mario Callabrò had never thought he'd see the day, but not only was it here, but he was standing here, in the midst of it. Many of the CISL faithful had not attended the rally, something of an ironic striking of the strike, out of political convictions, but many more workers found their sense of worker unity and allegiance when the call was made. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw some of the fellow rally attendees stumble and fall, some shouts and harsh words were said. By the time Mario made it over to help the fallen man to his feet, the stumblers were already gathering themselves.\n\n"Some jackass was shoving their way through the crowd towards the exit." The fallen worker muttered as he rubbed his head. A bump, nothing more. "I can't see him anymore, he must've been in a hurry, I suppose."\n\nNone of the men recognized the man as someone from any of their unions, but the matter soon gave way to introductions and banter, as men of all three unions continued to mingle and build bridges."

Any man would be exhausted.\n\nShaking hands once more with the representatives of the CGIL and UIL, he accepted the cheek kisses- socialist fraternal kisses, he was told- begrudgingly before waving his farewells. He stepped down from the stage, and into the crowd that still filled the block even as many of them were filtering out to leave. He was often sidetracked, shaking hands and accepting rough-handed pats on the back from the workers as he made his way, slowly but surely, towards his car parked behind the stage.\n\nThe silence and stale air of the interior of his car was welcome. He'd never liked driving much, the car was too small, too restraining, and always smelled too much like an old man. Tonight though, those features brought him a strange sort of comfort. He leaned back, and allowed himself a moment to stare up at the moon and rest.\n\nIt simply wouldn't do to fall asleep here, though. Home was''t far, and more than anything else, what he wanted was his bed, and some real, actual, restful sleep. He stuck the key in the ignition and turned it.\n\nThe engine turned over once, twice, and then it made a clicking noise.

His opponent and his cohorts in turn, received sparse applause and an awkward, oppressive silence once their statement was finished. It was clear to all in the building what direction this debate had swung the decision in, and it wasn't what Francesco had intended at all.\n\nThe vote came just over a week later, and while generally agreeing on most of the proposed policy changes, the results made it clear that any attempts at aligning themselves with the other Unions would not be tolerated by the workers themselves, voting a crushing eighty-five percent to maintain their own policies at the expense of solidarity.\n\nThe skies might have been clear outside, but a shadow still seemed to loom over Francesco. What more could he have done? Why was he so stupid as to put it to a vote? The individual worker didn't know the big picture, and you can't explain something like that over the course of an hour. There was no time to dwell on the past though, he had to plan for what would come next.\n\nPlanning that Mario was already beginning. The debate stirred something in him. Why was there such a concerted effort to align CISL with the Socialists, exactly? What game was CGIL playing with CISL and its common men? He didn't know, and he didn't like such an overt attempt at manipulating them.

For the past couple weeks, he had been speaking to union workers and advocates all over Milan, claiming that the Communists not only tried to infiltrate the CISL, but that they attempted to manipulate the vote. Mario Calabrò was no fan of communists, but he was no wackjob either.\n\nThe accusations were at first met with suspicion and skepticism. It sounded like a fascist conspiracy theory, but an idea repeated often enough and with enough conviction eventually takes on a life of its own. What if the Communists really did have the CISL suits in their pocket? What if they really were plotting to subsume the Union into their own for political gain?\n\n"I was like many of you at first. I didn't believe the rumors, the gossip, the mutterings about Communist influence and manipulations. Wrote it off! After all, I even had friends in the CGIL, why would they ever turn on me?" He was a gifted speaker, and with this dramatic pause, he had the gathering of workers practically standing on their toes, eagerly anticipating the rest of the speech.\n\n"But it was fortunate I'd have those friends! For one of them, conscience won out over ideology, and he told me of the plan that was being whispered between them. I still didn't believe him, until he took me to their headquarters and had me listen in on a conversation! It was true! Now that they've failed to open the door into CISL through the vote, they are making plans to infiltrate our ranks and spread their revolutionary ideology!" Mario could feel his own blood rising involuntarily, as much as he knew this man was speaking nonsense, he was still an effective speaker, and there was something about his message that he seemed to want to believe, but he couldn't put his finger on it.\n\n"Well, what about it then, men?" He held out his hands to either side. "Are we going to roll over and allow them to use us for their own ends?!" An open ended question, one that was answered with anger and frustration from among the crowd.\n\nBut then, something he didn't expect. They were red-faced in their rage, and they began to filter out of the room the speech was taking place in.

One voice said, his demands punctuated by a stone thrown to land at the feet of the opposition, doing nothing but eliciting a reply from the other side of the aisle.\n\n"Perhaps you should heed your own advice, suckling little pigs!"

The supporting shouts and follow-up jeers were interrupted when the CISL workers rushed the aisle to attack the CIGL workers head-on.\n\nWhere once insults and jeers were being exchanged, fists and feet took their place. The communists fell back at first, surprised at the sudden ferocity of their assailants. But with their numbers and their indignation, they rallied quickly, and met them with as much gusto as workers could muster.\n\nThe fight had only barely begun- and without any side gaining any seeming advantage in the short duration- when the flash of lights and wail of sirens interrupted the brawl. Like cats caught fighting in an alley, the workers scattered and rushed away from the arrival of the police officers, who rushed onto the scene with batons raised.\n\nA small skirmish, in truth, but all across the North of Italy, such suspicions and tensions flared up in isolated cases such as these. Workers stand as opposed to one another as they do to their supposed enemies as the Hot Autumn blazes on."

hotautumn.28.d:0 "News has come out of the parliament in Rome, in the midst of the General Strike across the North of Italy. While members of Parliament skillfully avoided directly crediting the Strike itself as the primary catalyst for the passing of a recent bill, the Italian people were not fooled. This was a victory for the Workers, not a gift from a benevolent ruling class.\n\nThe breadth of the bill was expansive, covering most of the most pressing issues that the leaders of the striking Unions cited as their primary purposes for the strike. Poor wages and deteriorating infrastructure, inadequate social safety nets and even worse safety conditions, the list was long, and the proposed bill couldn't possibly cover it all. Now union leaders will need to decide if the government's response to the crisis is adequate.\n\nUntil then, the workers will remain on strike, and they, along with the protesting students and police, will remain active in the streets. In spite of the news, tensions are still high across the country, and few have much of any hope that any unenthusiastic legislation is going to put an end to the crisis any time soon."

A mixture of arguments and conversations tore through the CSIL office like a knife through butter. Francesco Inceli eyed the list of names and numbers across his desk, and gave a sigh.\n\nThe union was large, and it was a target. Allegations of corruption were common as were the occasional threat from many groups. The left wanted more entreaties, the right wanted them to bash Bolshevists- and the phones never stopped ringing. It was in times like these that Francesco did his best to remain calm; for he had calls to make.\n\nSpecifically there were three things on his mind, though he had enough time to do them today .\n\nA call to Milan, where a roundtable would be offered and workers negotiated with.\n\nA call to Rome, where investigations were being made into the unions.\n\nAnd finally, a call to home. His son and he had several disagreements, but there was always the possibility that the two could reconcile. There was hope."

hotautumn.30.t:0 "Call Milan"
hotautumn.30.d:0 ""I'm telling you, Francesco, they won't go for it." The voice on the other end of the line sounded exasperated, tired even. They'd been arguing in a circle for going on eight minutes, though it sure felt longer. But neither Francesco Inceli nor Timoteo Sartor could exactly just hang up the phones and do their job without coming to an agreement of some kind.\n\n"Then the strike's going to peter out if we can't organize this damn thing. The companies will come back in once one Union settles and leverage us back down into the pavement." Inceli's rebuttal was weak, he knew, but it was all he had, and he wasn't wrong either. His point just failed to address the opposing point. Inceli replied, leaning over his desk with a desperate expression that bled into his voice.\n\n"You overestimate how much trust they have in us.at the end of the day. Any agreement we come to with the Communists will be suspect. They'll think we've sold them out if we make any kind of accord in private rooms and phone calls." The grumbling came through on the other side, entirely right in his assertions too. "They don't trust us, Francesco."\n\nFrancesco fell silent for a long time, allowing the quiet to dominate the line for nearly an entire minute. Sartor was about to speak up when Inceli suddenly broke the silence. "What if it wasn't up to us?"\n\n"You mean we lie to them and say that we were approached first? Or..."\n\n"No, I mean, make it a broad union vote, rather than an internal decision. There's a few issues the Union's voting on in a few weeks, why not make opening up lines of discussion with the other Unions one of those issues?"\n\n"And what happens if they don't vote for it? "\n\n"We can try to convince them. They're good men, by and large, and should listen to reason when reason presents itself. Maybe we have a rally beforehand, or a debate, perhaps? Let them make up their own mind, and pray to God that they make the right decision.""

hotautumn.31.d:0 "Even when they happened through a cable, discussions with the leadership of CISL followed a sort of liturgical ritual. After a bored telephone operator redirected his call, Francesco waited patiently and devoutly for a voice to answer him. As the responder demanded to know who the caller was, Francesco answered - and then he had to wait again to be redirected to the proper office, with a buzzing hum ringing inside the phone. Finally, a booming voice, with a very distinguishable Roman accent, rang out - "Ah, I've been expecting your call!"\n\nAfter the ritual small talk about the foggy weather of Milano and the sweltering heat of Rome, as well as an exchange of completely irrelevant news about the respective families, Francesco heard the question he was expecting - "So, what can you tell me about the situation at Bicocca?". What could be told about an entire district in open revolt, where brutal riots are becoming the norm and blood dirties the sidewalks? For once, Francesco decided to be extraordinarily blunt. "Well, the situation might be somewhat inconvenient right now, but I'm sure everything will soon be under control."\n\n"That's what I wanted to hear!" said the bellowing voice of his superior. "See, I was right when I noticed you. From now on, you can consider yourself in charge of the CISL section for all of Pirelli - and if any of those other boring Milanese pansies try to stop you, just tell me and we'll shut them up!" Francesco swallowed, the noise he made covered by the laughter on the other end of the line. "Now I have to go, I'm terribly busy these days - apparently a bunch of goddamn communist students set fire to a factory shed in Roma Nord and they're trying to pin it on us! Can you believe it?! Anyway, good luck in Milano - and remember, don't disappoint me! Buonasera, ciao, ciao, cia-". A click was followed by silence - and the liturgy ended."

hotautumn.32.t:0 "The Rotten Union"
hotautumn.32.d:0 "Originally founded in 1918, the Italian Confederation of Labour was the first major Catholic inspired trade union in the country - and was quickly shut down by the fascist regime. During the Italian transition to democracy, it was reorganized as the Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions, or CISL for short, and quickly rose to prominence as one of the major unions in the country. Unlike the other major unions, suspected of being dens of socialists or, God forbid, communists, CISL has always been the union for the upstanding, respectable Italian worker and foreman - a man such as Francesco Inceli.\n\nCISL has always been openly and unapologetically closely affiliated with DC, and some of its critics say that the habits of the party were quickly reflected by the union - some of its other critics say that this is in fact because CISL is nothing more than a DC sock puppet. Many workers, even those who shared the views of the union, felt that CISL was not acting in their interests, but in those of the party. Combined with the somewhat embarrassing instances of corruption going on in the union, this severely harmed the legitimacy of CISL in the eyes of those people it was meant to represent. Despite this, CISL was still one of the biggest unions in Italy, and was often able to dictate its line to other, smaller unions such as UIL.\n\nThese and more facts roamed around Francesco's head as he sat at his office desk once again, staring at his phone, while the white bakelite box stared him back. Corruption was an issue that could be too hard to tackle, and doing it in this delicate situation could be counterproductive - but it would go at great lengths to rehabilitate CISL's image in the eyes of workers, and possible ease tensions as workers will be more willing to let CISL negotiate a solution to the crisis. Another, much safer, option would be to instead use CISL's political weight to convince a smaller union, such as UIL, to work in tandem with CISL and safeguard the latter's position as the main anti-socialist trade union. Two phone numbers, hastily written on a note, sit on Francesco's desk, waiting for a decision."

Demotions and expulsions became the norm, and quite a few prominent names in the local section of CISL received a visit from the Guardia di Finanza. And amidst all this, Francesco Inceli sat content in his office, taking the chance to fill the spots left vacant with men he trusted.\n\nA ring filled the hot, humid air of the office. Francesco picked up the phone, greeted by the voice of one of his colleagues. "What the fuck do you think you're doing?!" The man on the other side of the cable was talking faster, and breathing ever faster. "There's goddamn Fiamme Gialle in my office! They're taking my papers! This all started because of you! You're just trying to get us all in trouble so you can fill our positions with your friends, don't you?! This is not the last you hear from me!

Representatives from DC and even some members of FD spoke in front of an audience of CISL and UIL bureaucrats, reassuring the people that a peaceful resolution to the current crisis would be found through dialogue and mutual understanding between labour, businesses, and government. A victory against radicalism, for sure - and as the glasses of the politicians touch each other in celebratory toasts, the riots in the streets of Italy show no sign of subsiding."

"Francesco Inceli, I'm with CISL. I'm calling to speak with Representative Diolo?"\n\nAnother waiting period just long enough to be irritating, but not long enough to actually be inconvenient, and then the line was picked up, answered by a voice hoarse and whispery. "Nestore Diolo, UIL." Representative Diolo sounded older than he was, but he was still an old man by union standards.\n\n"Nestore. It's Francesco. Again."\n\nThe silence on the other end of the line was deafening, but eventually, Nestore did respond. "Mister Inceli. How can I help you?" He spoke in an even, cool tone, one tinged with suspicion- well-earned suspicion, admittedly.\n\nGod above, Francesco hated doing this. He'd have to veil his disgust for the time being though. "I have, erm, found myself in charge of the local offices for this branch of the Union, Nestore, and it's come to my attention that your own Union's branch here is having some... Funding problems, is that correct?"\n\nHe was met with a silence more telling than any audible confirmation could be. Idly scratching down a note, he nodded to himself before clearing his throat and continuing. "If, maybe, you and your union would be willing to do something for us, we could help with that."\n\nAnother long silence. Francesco could practically hear the walls of ethics built up around the old Union Man crumbling in that silence before he rasped out his reply. "Very well then Mister Inceli. Let's hear it...""

hotautumn.36.d:0 "Workers' Solidarity only goes so far these days, it would seem. Francesco Inceli was enjoying his morning mug of coffee while looking over Le Conquiste del Lavoro, and the news within was somehow the more bitter of the two. It was good news, if you stood far enough back, but it did not sit well with the Representative regardless.\n\nThe story was about the Communists in the CGIL accusing the UIL of corruption with regards to recent negotiations with Fiat, where they adopted an uncharacteristically conciliatory stance towards the company. Of course, UIL was corrupt, but not in the way that the Communists were accusing them of. If you listened to CGIL, you'd believe that the UIL was taking bribes from either Rome or Fiat, to moderate their position, but in reality, it was CISL they were being influenced by.\n\nIt took a few more private conversations, and of course, promises of financial and political support should UIL adjust a few troublesome policies in order to be more in line with that of CISL's. They had overestimated how much the results of the deal would satiate the workers, the bribe money had gone to good causes, most of it anyways. The UIL was able to keep its various worker programs and its newsletter funded as of late, but that seemed to matter little and less for their own workers, who saw the recent compromises as a stain upon the Union's name, and suddenly, their support of the union was wavering.\n\nThere was a joke somewhere in the workers revolting against the Union, but while that wasn't the intended effect, CISL would benefit. UIL would never admit to bowing to another union, that may not be enough to kill one of Italy's largest unions, but it would absolutely test its limits. So in effect, while the other two largest unions in Italy bickered, CISL could stay, aloof and seemingly focused on what the union was founded to do in the first place.\n\nAll he needed to do was strongarm innocent and hardworking men into taking the fall for his politicking. Maybe another cup of coffee would distract Francesco from that fact..."

hotautumn.37.d:0 "Francesco Inceli adjusted the tie around his neck and straightened his back. This may very well be the most important speech he makes in his life, and he wanted to impress. While the crowd may not be the teeming masses of CISL's workers, they were many of the local and regional leaders of CISL, among the brass of the union, no men were closer to the pulse of the average worker- and there was no one in the union they trusted more to be honest.\n\nHe stepped out and stood behind the podium and put on a solemn, serious expression. "Friends, let me firstly thank you all for taking the time to meet with me today. I know many of you had to drive a long way, your labors have not been overlooked." The appreciation did not seem to elicit much of a reaction, but it was there more for sincerity's sake anyways.\n\nHe continued. "I understand- we, understand- that the union, is not perfect. It cannot be perfect, for despite all our lofty rhetoric, we are only human at the end of the day. I know, it must be shocking for you to hear a man in a suit admit that out loud." That at least gathered a few isolated chuckles. He was winning them over, but slower than he'd hoped.\n\n"But... We didn't sign up for perfection, now did we? Perfection is something that only exists in fantasy and dreams. This is why perfection is the domain of the revolutionary, and not the reformer. We know you have heard the recent news, and we want to reaffirm, with all of you, our continued commitment to constant ceaseless improvement. Not just in the workplaces and in conditions for the workers, but also in our own conduct, our own management, and our own effectiveness as a Union."\n\nThere were no smiles, no cheers, no enthusiastic applause, but they were nodding, nodding! There was still plenty of speech to go, but he was already through what he expected to be the roughest patch. Francesco could feel his own confidence solidifying as he glanced back down to his notes."

Things have only gotten worse for CGIL and UIL in the weeks following the start of the Strike, and they certainly didn't seem to be improving, or even in much of a position to effectively negotiate.\n\nCISL on the other hand? Business as usual, really, and not only that, but they were able to take advantage of the chaos and grow as a union, continuing to entrench themselves as the dominant Union in Northern Italy as the Strike wears on, grabbing more and more of the Government in Rome's attention as they did so. If there was going to be anyone who could bring this strike to an end in favor of the working man, why not CISL?\n\nThe General Strike was far from over, but slowly but surely, many opinions began to turn. With CISL hard at work, some of the worse-off workers could even return to their jobs without worrying too hard about compromising the strikers' negotiating position."

He'd heard the news of the barricade at the Statale and how the situation had grown more volatile since it began, but he- as much as he was ashamed to admit it- was too distracted with the General Strike to check on his son Virgilio, a student at that very university.\n\nAnd more distressingly? A member of the gang that had occupied the campus and was running that barricade. He needed answers, and could feel his own desperation mounting as he dialed the college's number once more, and sat in tense anticipation as the phone rang... And rang...\n\nAnd was actually picked up this time. He practically gasped as the voice of a young woman came on the other side. "This is Gia, with the Statale, who is this calling?"\n\n"Francesco, uh Francesco Inceli. I'm calling after a student, Virgilio Inceli?"\n\nSilence for a moment, save for the distant muttering of "Gia" with others that she was apparently standing with. After a moment of this, her voice returned to the line. "You're in luck, Mister Inceli. Virgilio was seen leaving the campus, he was going to the train stations, it looked like. No one knows where he-"\n\nThe phone hit the cradle at what must have been record speed, and within moments, Francesco Inceli was in a dead sprint, jacket, hat, and briefcase held close against his chest with the same arm.

The other sporting a leather jacket, a shaved head, and a fasces pin.\n\nFor a moment there was silence. Father was the first to break it.\n\n"Are you alright? I heard what happened at the Stalale."\n\nOf course. He had seen what had happened on the TV and wanted to make sure if his precious little boy was okay.\n\n"I'm fine."\n\nThe silence returned, colder and emptier than before. This time, Virgilio spoke.\n\n"I came to see if you had changed your mind."\n\n"About you joining that group of Nazi performance artists? Of course I haven't."\n\nThe words came out faster and harsher than Father first had intended. When he spoke again, there was a quiver in his voice.\n\n"But you're still my son."\n\nThe silence was deeper than ever, an abyss between father and son like a thousand boxes of emptiness in a forgotten warehouse.\n\nThen Virgilio spoke once more."

He declared, raising a hand towards the doorway, his gaze growing harder as he spoke. "On one side, is socialist suffering and death! On the other is a national restoration for us and generations to come! If only I had a father who fought to push the nation towards restoration with me!"\n\nHis father tried to speak up, he reached out to put a reassuring hand on Virgilio's shoulder, but the youth slapped it away, stepping forward in turn with an accusing finger to poke into his father's chest. "It's not too late." He whispered, a voice trembling with emotion. Rage? Sorrow? Who was to tell? "Come with me, to the barricades. We'll destroy the socialist threat, we'll save Italy, father."\n\nAnother chasm of quiet emerged between the two, even as they stood close together, eyes locked, neither of the two willing to blink first. It would only be an exhalation from Virgilio's father that broke the stilled air.\n\n"No matter what." He whispered, stepping back, eyes cast meekly to his feet. "No matter what Virgilio, you are still my son." And then he turned on his feet, from the balcony, back and into the home.\n\nThere would be no time for tears. No time to rage or shout. With trembling fists and burning eyes, Virgilio turned from home and began the trek back to the barricade. This was good, he decided. After all, in the fight against evil, there is no greater weapon than anger. Unfettered, righteous rage burned in like a fire in his belly, and he'd be all the greater a warrior for it, and all Italy would bear witness, he knew."

A herd of animals might act erratically, but it's always a response, you can always tell that there's something pushing them in one direction or another, at the end of the day. But when the situation gets as crowded and the tensions rise as high as they did at the barricade tonight, cause and effect leave the realm of the material and become something arcane, ought not be understood because it cannot.\n\nAnd like the force of nature it was, the protests and the barricade broke the tension. Did someone throw something? Did the shouts and insults finally strike a nerve? Did someone move too erratically, too suddenly, and unleash the cascade of violence? Was it the fault of the left, or that of the right?\n\nDoes it matter?\n\nIt was all consuming, the suddenness and completeness of the outbreak. All at once, the masses of protesting students rushed forward, with little else but fist, branch and stone to wield against their foe in the barricade. Chants and shouts erupted as the sides clashed together in a violent cacophony.

So they were the greys.\n\nThe blacks were the police. Forced to spend weeks in full riot gear carrying heavy batons and guns, their nerves were at the breaking point. The officers, brave, exhausted, extraordinarily corrupt protectors of the innocent Italian public, wanted the disorder to end at any cost.\n\nWhen the leftists charged, it was for them a heroic and radical action to defend the Italian workers. For the FUAN, it was the inevitable clash of ideologies necessary for a strong national future.\n\nFor the police, it was an excuse.\n\nAs if they were a single great beast from the stories, the black armored line roared and surged forwards.\n\nThen there were no more colors, no more sides.

It was a scream of years lost, a scream that expelled and breathed out his hatred he held deep inside, a scream that banished the rage and violence that he had allowed to permeate to his core.\n\nHis father hugged him all the tighter in response, and after a few seconds that lasted an eternity, he slowly led Virgilio into his home- their home. After leaving the pale-faced, tear-eyed youth on a chair, his father prepared a kettle of tea for the two of them, and they continued to speak.\n\n"I don't know where to continue from here."

"Back before you well and truly lost your way, we'd often argue, and you often told me that when evil rose, it was the duty of good men to stand against it, that anything else only abetted such evils, yes?" He leaned back. "If you unleashed this beast of hatred, of rage and violence, then if you are to start being a good man, it is up to you to stand against it."\n\n"I don't think I can, the barricade is still up and there are many more of them than there are of me." Virgilio rubbed an arm uncertainly as he spoke, in spite of the heat.\n\n"Words, Virgilio, are action." His father declared emphatically. "Violence does not cure violence, so perhaps it's time for you to give the strength of words instead of fists."\n\nVirgilio mulled that over in his head a few times after hearing that, and his brows knit in determination as the vision grew clearer. He knew what he had to do."

hotautumn.46.d:0 "For the first time in recent memory, Virgilio saw the world with clear eyes. And when he saw the world around the barricade, he saw madness. Slogans and chants were being thrown across between the Socialist protesters and the fascist barricade, threats of violence and denunciations filled the air, and what once sounded sweet to the ear had a harshness to it that he couldn't detect before.\n\nA deep breath in through the nose and out through the mouth, Virgilio steeled himself as he snuck his way around the protesters to return to the barricade, where he was greeted with shouts of approval and ecstatic greetings from his comrades.\n\n"Virgilio! What took you so long? We had thought you might have fled! Glad to see we are wrong!"\n\n"The reds are growing agitated out there, have you heard anything that can help us?"\n\n"What is the nation saying about this? Are they rallying behind our example?"\n\nVirgilio tugged at his shirt collar for a moment, and spoke slowly and with a measured tempo. "The nation remains as divided as ever." He admitted, glancing at the faces of his compatriots. It was clearly not what they wanted to hear, they wanted to hear of a fascist nation, reinvigorated by their actions here. He'd have to lay it on thick. "Some think what we are doing here is admirable, while others scold us for our defiance and belligerence."\n\n"But surely, we are doing good work here, right Virgilio? The ones who stand with us aren't sitting idle, right?"\n\nVirgilio's silence struck them more severely than any words could. Where once fiery, impassioned eyes once glared hatefully at the enemy across the way, now they glanced uncertainly between one another. They were looking for that fire, that fury that up to a few moments ago, they all shared.\n\nThere was none to be found."

Where once they could navigate the chaos and confusion of the times with the help of their firm faith in the Fascist ideals of yore, the foundation on which their strength was built was all at once rocked.\n\nThe uncertainty, the fear, the panic immediately set in. They looked to Virgilio for guidance, and he spoke with a resigned voice. "There's nothing for us here. When the sun sets, we can slip away, we can pretend like-"\n\n"Pretend like nothing happened, Virgilio? When did you turn so craven?" A voice piped up from behind him. He didn't recognize the man, but evidently the man recognized him.\n\n"I... Yes. I think it's pretty clear that-"\n\nThe man interrupted him, stepping between Virgilio and the other students. "Pretty clear that your belly is weak and your spirit quails in the wake of challenge. You want to know why no one has rallied? Because all we've done is hide behind wood and stone!"\n\nOnce again, Virgilio could feel his blood rise and the bile build up in his throat. But this wasn't like before, it was different on some level he couldn't quite identify. "And what would you propose instead?"\n\nThe provocateur shot a fist up into the air. "We take the fight to the Communists! We rush the reds, prove our valor, and drive them off before us! Then all Italy will see that she still has strength!"\n\nIt was strange. He'd said much the same before and often, had he sounded so deluded before? How many people must have written him off as a madman? How many people might have been right to do so?\n\nVirgilio glanced over towards the rest of the students and sighed. "This was a mistake. All of this. Those of you with something to live for, come with me." He turned and began to walk, and could hear the meek shuffling of feet, about half of those gathered, he reckoned.\n\n"And those of us with something to fight for will stay! Go home you old women, to your knitting and rocking chairs! Us men will fight for you even still." The remaining half turned and went back to the palisade."

It wasn't even particularly close either, against the socialists' overwhelming numbers and the police with their riot gear and their batons, spirit proved to be of little use as a weapon or as armor.\n\nIt was them, the true Sons of Italy, the salvation of the nation and those who carried the spirit of Mussolini with them, who sulked away from the battle. For now, they had no choice but to hide their shame and the humiliation of their failure here.\n\nBut that was only for the time being. The fascists would hide their face, they'd slink off, but they'd go home. They'd reflect on their defeat here, and if their spirits didn't quail, it would be a source of rage, of fury, fuel for the fire in the belly.\n\nThey'd take that with them to their dorms, to their homes, their villages and their communities. It would burn inside of them, and it would serve as a hundred beacons for those with a similar spirit, a familiar rage as the bloodied Fascists.\n\nLet the reds celebrate for now, they can have their repetitive songs and girlish dances. While they're patting themselves on the back, the Blackshirts will nurse their wounds and prepare for the next round. They will learn from their mistakes and be more prepared for whenever the next confrontation occurs, in whatever form it does.\n\nAt least, that's the hope anyways."

hotautumn.49.d:0 "Virgilio Inceli awoke, looked out the window of his dorm, groaned, and felt angry.\n\nIt was unseasonably warm for this late in the year, and the poorly ventilated dorm was baking. Of course it wouldn't matter if there was any money in the school budget for some half decent air conditioning, but there wasn't. The school probably had wasted all the money on keeping the union workers happy, and the economy had been in the trash since the democratic transition anyway.\n\nHe got dressed, and walked to his first class, History of Italian Politics. The professor was a degenerate, a coward, probably a secret communist, and worst of all, a woman. Inceli thought about her, and he felt hateful.\n\nOn his way, a group of radical students was holding a demonstration in the main university thoroughfare. Their proud red banners caught the sunlight as they strutted back and forth, and they had a partisan sort of bravery about them as they chanted slogans. If Virgilio had been with his friends, brave companions of the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale, they would have chased the leftists back to their hidey holes. But they were busy, and he was alone, so he slunk away and proceeded.\n\nIt wasn't that Virgilio Inceli was reluctant to join in the struggle for national redemption-- it's just that he was indecisive. Many of his fellows were meeting with the national organization, trying to persuade the Blocchi Nazionali to find its balls. They had asked him to come, and he had demurred. They had had high hopes for Almirante. He had been a rising star in the PNF before its dissoltion but now he seemed nothing more than a tired old man... Others were at the new front, fighting the new battle with sticks and rocks against the communists and their police collaborators.\n\nAs Virgilio Inceli joined the class, his thoughts were still on the strikes, the meeting, and the future of the nation. But they strayed from this as well, and moved on to other things. Feelings he had half forgotten. A home, a father who didn't understand. Having comrades, but not friends. And as the class came to its end, and Virgilio Inceli stood at the building's threshold, struggling to make a decision, he felt lonely."

hotautumn.50.d:0 "Home for Inceli was a quiet middle class district on Milan's outskirts. It wasn't a long trip, but he took his time nonetheless.\n\nVirgilio had been surprised at how easily his compatriots in FUAN had accepted his departure. He had expected that they would plead for him to stay -- to accompany the leadership to Rome and the BN meeting, or to the barricades to strike down the Bolshevik protestors. But they had accepted his flimsy excuses with a smile and a wave. Perhaps they had never put as much faith in his leadership as he thought.\n\nHe'd show them. He'd show everyone. His father would be the first -- he'd see the error of his ways, and by tomorrow he'd be with them at the barricades. DC, CISL, all the spineless traitors, would be neutered, and Inceli would get the credit for destroying one of the three loathsome oppressors of the Italian people.\n\nVirgilio thought back to their last conversation when he told his father he'd joined the FUAN. He'd expected him to be proud, hadn't he always said that Socialism would be the first thing to destroy Italy? Hadn't he, like any good citizen, had a poster of Il Duce on their dining room wall? But FatherFirst Inceli had changed. He had been infected by the same weakness that permeated the rest of the nation.\n\nSo father and son had parted in rage and tears, one to join the most effeminate and corrupt of unions, the other to join the bold youth restoring the nation to greatness. It didn't matter. Inceli would show him. This time, with the streets filled with fire and radicals, he'd have no choice but to see the light.\n\nThe train pulled into the station, and Virgilio Inceli stepped off shivering slightly, undoubtedly from the excitement of teaching his father the truth of the National Revolution. Or perhaps the cold."

hotautumn.51.t:0 "A Long Afternoon"
hotautumn.51.d:0 "It was a long bus ride to Rome, and a longer wait as the BN's security checked and double-checked Virgilio Inceli's clearance.\n\nWhen at last he was reunited with his comrades in the FUAN, it was a while after noon and Virgilio Inceli was thoroughly agitated. This was, it must be noted, not entirely to his detriment, as the FUAN was the sort of organization where furious agitation paid silver. Gold, if it was particularly insipid furious agitation, rooted in the general angst of everyday life and directed at the "enemies", whoever that might be at any particular time.\n\nFUAN, or at least the significant portion of its central committee present that the meeting, was a place of speeches, a place of rage and rabble rousing, a place of daring political maneuvers against the vile enemies of the Italian nation. These usually ranged from the traitors and cowards in Rome, vilified from a safe distance in the organization's weekly newsletter, to the on-campus radicals and leftists, enemies of all decent people and positively destroyed and eviscerated regularly by the scathing cartoons drawn by second-year Mario Salvini, often accompanied by Inceli's scathing editorials.\n\nBut the FUAN was more than just a group of noisy kids. They were the forefront of the national revolution. They were the Italian future. Their actions were more than just pranks and name-calling, they were bold moves to defend the people.\n\nAnd they were more than just pranks and name-calling. More often than not, when a strike escalated into violence, it was FUAN on the front lines. When heads needed to be kicked in, FUAN was the steel toed boot that did the job. There were whispers that some of their radical members had bought arms illegally, and were willing to use them. The actions of these few daredevils were spoken of in hushed tones, but awed ones nonetheless."

hotautumn.52.t:0 "Representatives from the Party"
hotautumn.52.d:0 "In the city of Rome, birthplace of European civilization, there was a building. The building was owned by the Blocchi Nazionali, a party that stood for the defense of Italian civilization, nationalism and democracy hand in hand, and definitely not Fascism.\n\nIt was not a grand building. On the outside it wasn't nearly as impressive as the concrete behemoth that served as the party's headquarters near the cities center. This building was made out of cracked brick, and graffitied heavily by all varieties of dissident ne'er do-wells. The inside similarly lacked the many creature comforts of the BN headquarters, being notably devoid of the in-house bars and smoke rooms that the BN's main locus' spartan exterior hid so well.\n\nStill, it was a building that the party put to good use. There were leaflets not yet ready for release that needed storage, certain items devoted party loyalists which were...inappropriate to store in a public place, and meetings that might be best kept out of the view of the commons. It was for this purpose that the building was used one warm fall day, as representatives from the BN's central committee met with the "grand council" of the Front of National Action of University Students.\n\nThe room was uncomfortably warm, and with great reluctance the students removed their black jackets. A few of them had sewn in small Fasces or depictions of Mussolini onto the breast pockets, and they grew glum as they discarded the wonderful attempt to challenge the BN's transition to non-fascism.\n\nThe BN representatives were, for the most part, exactly as Virgilio Inceli had expected. A bunch of old men in suits who harrumphed at the most mild suggestions of direct action, and wrung their hands in response to the FUAN's zeal.\n\nThe meeting also went about as well as he had thought it would. The FUAN proposed a direct series of counter-demonstrations against the counter demonstrations, and the BN looked shiftily from side to side. The FUAN demanded permission to openly use the words "communist", "bolshevik", "traitorous", and "bourgeois" in referring to their mutual enemies. The BN fiddled with their ties. The FUAN wanted the BN to formally support their right to use violence in self defence, the BN declared that it was time for a lunch break.\n\nWhen they returned, Inceli decided he had enough of this. It was time to bring matters to a head, and find out where the party's true loyalties lay. He cleared his throat and began to speak."

hotautumn.53.d:0 ""You are either with us, and our quest for the National Revolution, or against us"\n\nThe words had seemed powerful and daring in Inceli's head, but out loud they seemed only pithy. Even his compatriots on the FUAN side of the table seemed embarrassed. As the silence following Virgilio's pronouncement grew, they glanced at his hands, his feet, anywhere but his eyes, wide and scared, or the red pouring into his face.\n\nThen the uncomfortable silence was broken by applause.\n\nFrom the far end of the BN's side of the table there was one man, who while equal to the others in age and demeanor, differed from them radically in appearance. He wore a tight black turtleneck, somehow more imposing then the student's black leather. On his lapel, he wore not just the fasces but also the knife and skull. it was he who applauded, his hands meeting in sarcastic enthusiasm, the cruel lines of his face wrinkled in enthusiasm. When he spoke, the other BN reacted with curious mixtures of exasperation.\n\n"Absolutely! These youngsters might need some guidance, but they've got the right idea! The nation has gone to hell, and we need their vigor to bring it back. Believe, Obey, and Fight, that's what we need! We need to meet violence with violence."\n\nThe stunned silence returned, but before the students could react, one of the suits spoke in a tone of crisp dismissal.\n\n"The meeting is done. We appreciate the work of the FUAN, but we must ask you to vacate party premises immediately."\n\nMoments later Virgilio Inceli and the others were outside the building, a few of their jackets left behind in the haste of failure. The morning heat had evaporated, and fat mournful droplets had begun to fall from the sky.\n\nInceli supposed that he should feel angry. That he rally his compatriots against the weak and traitorous BN and their hollow bourgeois democracy they supported. But he felt only sadness of failure, and only disappointment in their eyes."

hotautumn.54.d:0 "Fate arrived for Inceli in the form of a small manila envelope, battered by its journey through the labyrinthian Italian mail system. He was not the first to receive such a missive, nor had he enitirely given up hope that he would be spared.\n\nFirst it had been the crazies. The contrarian lunatics who cling to every patriotic organization like mussels to a whale. The ones who spoke admiringly of Farinacci, of Hitler, even of the "discipline" of Burgundy. A few of them had somehow wormed their way into leadership in the FUAN, and when they received the letters no one spoke out, because after all, they were lunatics. Then it was the spineless. The ones who sought ever greater power for themselves, and were willing to ally with anyone and say anything to increase their own power. They would in one meeting make bold claims of the violence necessary for the restoration of Italian strength, and in another wring their hands about every scrape and bruise the FUAN meted out to its bolshevist rivals. When they received the letters of dismissal no one spoke out, because they were weak. Inceli had let himself hope then that the BN had some potential afterall, that they were merely acting to refocus its sister student organization, and that any day now they'd apologize for their conduct at the meeting and invite the remaining leadership back for further planning. But then it was the honorable. The true scions of Italian Nationalism, the ideological heirs of Mussolini, who sought to once more raise the people's patriotic consciousness and shephard in a return to glory. When the letters came for them, there was no one left to speak out. No leadership council to speak of except for the BN's puppets and toadies.\n\nVirgilio read the words one more time, his vision blurred with tears of rage. "While the leadership of the Blocchi Nazionali appreciates your contribution to the nationalist student movement, we have decided it is for the benefit of the movement for you to vacate your leadership position immediately."\n\nHe threw the letter aside. He would fight them. He'd go around the city, find all the representatives of past and present and rally them to action. FUAN's ex-leadership was rapidly accumulating an alphabet soup of splinter groups. Inceli would be their unifier. They'd go to the BN's offices and MAKE them see the way.\n\nIt would fail. They'd be arrested. There was nothing he could do.\n\nThe national students movement was defeated. He could do nothing.\n\nHe had failed."

It was a hungry sort of silence. An expectation. The sort that waits for more.\n\nVirgilio lowered his voice, making it quite, conspiratorial, dangerous, intimate: "We want the same thing. A free Italy. A strong Italy. We have made mistakes -- I am the first to admit it. But our enemies outnumber us ten to one, and have foreign support as well. If we are to triumph, it must be all of us together. It is either unity, or death."\n\nHe had them. A few of the oldest and slimiest representatives writhed in their seats, but they were by far a minority. One member of the party -- seated on the edge of the table and wearing the famous black turtleneck and pin of the MSVN went so far as to chuckle appreciatively.\n\nThen the center most delegate spoke: "Well... I think we should be able to arrange a meeting with our senior leadership. We'll let you know when."\n\nPart of Inceli wondered if this might be a trick, if the call would never come -- but it did.\n\nThe meeting was late at night, and at a mansion not a dodgy, crumbling office. The best the party had to offer. It was roses and chandeliers for the FUAN this time, not cracked streets and broken windows. They filed past well equipped security guards and into an office decked with splendor, complete with marble pillars and plush leather chairs.\n\nAnd there in the middle, Almirante.\n\nInceli had had doubts about the BN leader's sincerity before, but seeing him in the flesh, he knew that they were mistaken. The chairman was somehow wise as well as bold, kind and yet fierce. When he asked, softly but firmly for the FUAN's loyalty, Inceli was only too willing to give it.\n\nItaly would be strong again. Italy would be great again. The nation would rise once more, with Almirante at its head."

hotautumn.56.d:0 "The change didn't come all at once, nor was it so abrupt and dramatic as to be all that noticeable unless one was paying close attention to the state of FUAN as a whole. It was for just that reason that Inceli thought little of it when the local block leader and known provocateur actually spoke out in favor of a more moderate approach like the BN had been pushing for. When he saw that the man was perspiring a great deal, he put it down to some fair weather cold.\n\nHe didn't notice when the recruiter stopped haranguing non-members about the "Bolshevik menace" and "red terror"; he didn't notice when the district representative began to extort the position of the BN men and began to turn on his former allies, branding them, "Extremists who threaten to besmirch our message." He had no way to see how much healthier the representative's bank account had suddenly become, no way to see the bruises on the recruiters' sides.\n\nHe took notice when, almost overnight, the secretary for the FUAN branch of the city of Rome changed his position on working with the BN. Where he had only a few hours ago railed against the proposed rollback of aggression against suspected and known communist groups and individuals, he was now delivering a speech on the benefits of working with the established party to convince the people that Communism was not the answer to their problems. With horror Inceli began to remember every small hint, every change in behavior, every temper that had recently seemed to cool. He had taken it for granted that the last true believers of FUAN would hold firm against those who wished to use the name and legacy of fascism for their own selfish ends. He had been mistaken, and with every day passed, he could see that the rot of BN was ensnaring more and more prominent members of the leadership. He felt shame and disgust well up inside him, alongside the bitter taste of defeat. It was time to go back to the university, there was nothing he could do now."

Its occupants filed out heads hung low, exhausted from their trip and the failures they had experienced in its duration.\n\nBut, despite their bad news and long faces, they were greeted at the university with a hero's welcome. Inceli quickly found himself surrounded by a crowd of admirers and a bottle of wine pressed into his hands as they urged him to recount the details of his trip to Rome. In the haze of good drink and companionship, the details of the trip began to change in his mind. The BN's attitude was not defeat -- it was merely a setback! The FUAN was not broken, it was merely reorganizing to rise again!\n\nInceli listened to his friends and spoke to them in turn. They spoke of the grandeur that Italy lost -- and would no doubt regain. All of the undesirables that filled the streets like rats would be cleansed. The legions of Rome would march once more into the world, to firmly discipline the traitors and barbarians that threatened its conquests.\n\nThere, surrounded by his partners in heroic struggle, listening to a drunk first-year rambling about a group called the "nuclear army" or somesuch, Inceli felt content."

In some places, it wasn't the negligent art of malcontents, but intricate murals of bright futures and desolate wastelands alike, with a curious pagan symbol in place of the sun.\n\nThe FUAN was dead, but the dream of its members and their romantic quest for an Italy that never was had never been stronger. It was a dream that grew more radical and dangerous by the day as its members found ever more energetic channels with which to express their beliefs.\n\nIf they could not have the Italy they wanted -- the respected great power and prosperous fascist economy still described in too many textbooks -- then they would have no Italy at all.

Like this morning, when his usual route to the headquarters was disrupted by the prancing and shrill shouting of protestors.\n\nBeing late also meant he had to endure the slight of the meeting already having begun by the time he arrived. He had to pretend like nothing was wrong when his arrival prompted everyone else to turn and greet him, interrupting their discussion with empty pleasantries and mocking smiles, all the way until Virgilio took his seat.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, Virgilio was none too pleased to realize that they were planning demonstrations of their own.\n\n"Is this what we're reduced to? Pickets and slogans?"\n\nIt was telling just how eager his comrades were to justify their decision. "Don't think of it like that. Think of it like this instead:"\n\nAnother cut in, as if they'd rehearsed the damn thing. "We can only benefit by playing along with the democrats for the time being. We have- as it stands- something of a public image issue, and if we show ourselves to be reasonable and willing to work with the system that we have now, we can start to repair that image."\n\nAnother piped up. "How can the media slander us and call us thugs and brutes if we're out there with signs and protesting peacefully like the rest, after all?"\n\nVirgilio's arms were crossed over his chest, and he slouched some in his chair as they made their case. He didn't like it any more than he did at the start, but he had to admit that the plan had some merit. Not a great deal, but some.\n\n"I'll... Bow to your collective wisdom. So, what's the plan then?"\n\nThe speaker practically beamed as he was allowed to continue. "I was just saying that I've spoken with the police. They'll form a perimeter to-"\n\n"The police?" Virgilio's voice betrayed more of his incredulity than he'd meant to.\n\n"Yes, the police. As we said, we're trying to appear legitimate and law-abiding. They can both protect us if the communists try to antagonize us. They'd be willing to fight us alone, but riot cops with shields and batons?

As he continued, Inspector Ovidio turned towards Inspector Constantini and whispered with all the subtlety of a tank.\n\n"Where'd the kids find this one anyways?" He remarked, narrowing his eyes skeptically towards the stage. "He's good. Looks professional too. I had kind of assumed one of them would be up there, not someone who looks like he could sit in Parliament."\n\nConstantini tilted his head and tapped his own chin lightly with his own baton. "I've seen him before, I think." He muttered idly. "He does a lot of these speeches, I've walked by him before on my way home."\n\nThey were joined by an unexpected third voice, that of one of FUAN's student leaders, Virgilio Incelli, had moved his way towards the rear and apparently overheard them. "That's Pino Romualdi, he's from the BN, try to show a little respect."\n\nOvidio shrugged nonchalantly, seeming to not even notice the student's aggressive body language and tone. "He's just a speaker. Trying too hard to look and sound like the old Duce too. Someone should tell him he has a microphone and doesn't need to yell so loudly."\n\n"Well... Maybe it's inherited."

"Besides, maybe if you two listened to his words instead of his volume, you'd learn a thing or two about strength."\n\nConstantini felt an eye twitch involuntarily. "Maybe he could use some of that strength to tell us before he shows up unannounced next time. The speeches were supposed to be over by now."\n\nHe felt an instant sense of regret for having said that, but that was nothing compared to the look of abject hatred that young Incelli offered him instead..."

hotautumn.61.t:0 "Escalation"
hotautumn.61.d:0 "In that moment, Incelli simply stopped thinking. He would allow raw instinct take over, all the thinking in the world had only produced a farce, but now he'd produce action. He stormed up to the Inspector, and shoved him backwards. "And what do you care? Huh? Go up there, go stop him."\n\nThe Inspector was caught off guard by the display and wasn't prepared to respond when two more officers from the cordon stepped forward, placing themselves between the student and Constantini with their batons brandished.\n\nBy now the scene had captured the attention of all of those gathered, the speaker was talking to part of his own personal security, while the fascist students stood behind Virgilio, who stared between the two officers. One of them held out a hand and simply demanded that the young man hand over his baton.\n\nIt all happened so fast, the sound of a baton's crack against flesh and bone, the immediate roar of approval from the fascistic students, the cries and shouts of dismay from the officers, the sound of rushing boots across the cobblestones and the sidewalks. The officer who had demanded the baton clutched his snapped forearm against his chest, but soon enough, there would be too much going on to help the poor man.\n\nAll across the square, Incelli's comrades surged forward and followed his example, the police had expected some hostility, but quickly, the situation spun out of their control. On all sides, students and police officers wrestled and charged with batons in hand, the sounds of violence as varied as it was bloody spilling into the streets around them."
hotautumn.61.a:0 "This is out of control..."

hotautumn.62.t:0 "Charge"
hotautumn.62.d:0 "The police, in spite of the surprise of the sudden charge of the students, held their own in the ensuing scattered fights around the block. Only a small number had fallen, most often to head blows and arms struck by batons, while they continued to hold against their assaulters.\n\nAs for the students, for all of their ferocity and their zeal, they were still students and not fighters. As soon as they had rushed the officers, some were already falling back, while others had rushed the exact opposite direction, towards the stage that the politicians and speakers had already vacated. Few paid them any sort of mind, however, as the battle raged, and the tide began to shift.\n\nThe better-equipped and more well-prepared forces of the police began to, one by one, drive off their attackers. The handful who had fallen to blows to the head, arms, and bellies were dragged behind the cars, and now it was starting to become the police who chased the protestors and not the other way around.\n\nAs if the situation hadn't gotten bad enough for the FUAN, the din of the fighting was quickly drowned out by the roar of engines, the pressure of tires on cobblestone, and the rumble of armored vans storming into the square.\n\nThe panic quickly mounted among the students, but to their credit, they did not merely flee and disperse. Instead, they turned and they rallied, back to where the students who had turned back earlier had run to. When they emerged from behind the stage, they had discarded their batons and now their blood-caked knuckles carried pistols and rifles in their steads.\n\nSoon, the streets would ring with the song of gunfire."
hotautumn.62.a:0 "We didn't mean for any of this to happen..."

hotautumn.63.t:0 "Chaos"
hotautumn.63.d:0 "The square looked empty, save for the half-collapsed wooden stage and the armored cars and vans that formed a perimeter of safety for the officers. Crouched behind the protective vehicles, the police officers formulated a plan to drive out the students from the square and restore order.\n\nThe students whose presence they felt, but they could not see. Scattered among the buildings in the square, behind trees and within bushes, the rebellious students held their rifles and pistols close to their chest. From their hiding positions, they watched the semicircle of armored vehicles and waited, fingers and feet drumming impatiently against walls, cobbles, trees, and their weapons.\n\nTheir patience frayed. Plans came to fruition. The silence of the square was filled with tension and unease, and both parties waited for the other to make the first move. The silence was first disturbed, but not broken, by jeers, shouts, and insults from one side to the other, but still, the tension did not break. That didn't happen until the first gunshot.\n\nIt was impossible to tell whose gun fired first, but the result was all the same. The boots of the law stormed the square, and the amateur shots of the students filled it with the song of gunfire. Lead cracked and splintered against the road and sidewalks, as officers fired back against students and into the shadows.\n\nIn groups of two and three, police moved through the square and the storm of bullets that filled the air around them. The fight would need to take place building by building, tree by bush by shrub. The work has only begun, and already there were grunts and shouts of pain as the bullets found their marks regardless."

hotautumn.64.t:0 "Death"
hotautumn.64.d:0 ""Stay close." Ovidio muttered as the two of them proceeded cautiously deeper into the alley. The Inspectors had their pistols drawn and held at the ready, pointed down by their legs as they tread further and further from the safety perimeter. "Don't want to fuck it up in the final moments, right?" He offered Constantini an unconvincing smile.\n\nThe operation was in fact, wrapping up. The absolute overkill that the police forces had brought into the square meant that the poorly armed and untrained students couldn't hold out forever. Rather than facing arrest, most of them had fled, though it was noted that there were a number of students who were staying and taking potshots at the officers who remained.\n\nInspector Ovidio had sworn up and down that he'd seen a shape rush from some of the brush and into an alley straddling the square that the broken-up demonstrations had taken place in. So far, there wasn't much to suggest that anyone had been down this way, but if there was one thing these militant students were good at, it was hiding. Maybe Constantini would have a joke for that if they weren't also armed. "Keep your voice down. Echoes."\n\nConstantini's eyes scanned the walls and windows above as he proceeded, now alone against an unknown for. Slow, measured movements from one windowsill caused the Inspector to jump, turning his pistol skywards.\n\nThe cat on the sill stopped in the middle of its grooming, its leg high in the air and feline eyes glaring judgmentally down to the officer. Constantini lowered his pistol, and gave a slight chuckle. He must be losing his-\n\nThe sound of the gunshot and the crack of a bullet against cobblestone blended with one another, but he didn't have time to consider that before the sharp, shattering pain struck him in the side of his knee. He fell with a shout that must've been audible as far as the Vatican. He could just barely register the pain when his head struck the wall.\n\nOvidio was saying something as he cradled Constantini's collapsing form, but he couldn't quite hear it. Even as blood ran from his head and onto Ovidio's leg and the cobbles beneath, Constantini couldn't keep from chuckling.\n\n"It was just a cat, Ovidio." He laughed, his voice weakening by the moment. He got the last word in, "Just... a dumb cat..." before his chuckles faded into a rattle."

hotautumn.65.t:0 "Silence"
hotautumn.65.d:0 "Before turning away and rejoining the rest of the students to watch out the remainder of Romualdi's speech. Eventually, the man's speech would run its course, and while he offered one final call to action to his steadfast audience, there was a sense of palpable relief that washed over both Student and Officer.\n\nQuickly- with perhaps a bit more haste than considered polite- the police went into formation to provide an escort for the FUAN students to leave the square. Curiously, however, the students didn't only take their time getting ready, they didn't seem to really be moving or preparing much at all. The gathered audience, even as Romualdi and the other speakers prepared to go on their way, just stayed and milled about listlessly in the square.\n\nInspector Constantini peered at the sun that threatened to set behind the horizon, and then back to the formed line of officers. Letting his shoulders slink, he nodded to himself before walking up and towards the gathered students. He reached out to tap the shoulder of the nearest one, and once again, was met with the scornful gaze of Virgilio Incelli.\n\n"Mister Incelli." Constantini maintained an even, diplomatic tone to his voice, though he suspected his face betrayed how tired he was at this point. "The cordon is ready to escort you and your compatriots out of the square, we were wondering when-"\n\n"That won't be necessary." Came the curt reply of Virgilio, cutting off the officer and leaving both silent as the Inspector processed what had just happened. Virgilio gave a brief glance back to his fellow students who didn't know what game Virgilio was playing. Not that he could blame them, he didn't know what he was trying to accomplish, save for stepping on the pig's toes.\n\n"Not necessary?" Constantini tilted his head towards the youth. A way out if he wanted to take it, but the offer only emboldened young Incelli.\n\n"Entirely unnecessary. We're not leaving. Our point has not yet been made." He crossed his arms and maintained eye contact with Constantini. "Feel free to go home yourselves, however. We can handle ourselves without you."\n\nWith a deep sigh and a shrug, Inspector Constantini turned back towards the cordon. He was going to require a few more opinions on this..."
hotautumn.65.a:0 "Firm resolve or senseless stubbornness?"

hotautumn.66.t:0 "Fear"
hotautumn.66.d:0 ""They're students. Practically children. If they don't want to move, then make them move. You're police, act like it damn it."\n\nThat response wasn't what Constantini had wanted to hear from headquarters. He had hoped that the chief might be willing to negotiate with them, but the terms were clear. This disorderly behavior went beyond the protections of their right to gather together and right to protest, and they would just have to obey.\n\n"Well, they came prepared. If we're going to force them to go anywhere, we're going to need some backup..."\n\nThe FUAN on the other hand, was not of a mind to negotiate, nor were they of a mind to obey. It had taken a bit of time, and more than a bit of reinforcing, fiery rhetoric to sway the other members of the FUAN over to his side. But in spite of their general spinelessness, Virgilio Incelli would gain ground.\n\n"It is about time we practiced a little of what we preached. It's time we showed these corrupt officials what Italian strength and spirit looks like in action!" Came his final rallying cry, met with the scattered shouts and hoots from the rest of the student body. He turned, and with the helmets and flags of the FUAN standing behind him, he faced the baton-wielding police officers.\n\n"Any chance you'll rethink this insanity?" Constantini offered one last time, an empty hand extended in a gesture of goodwill towards the man on the other side of the gap. "If you go now, there won't be any consequences. It'll be as if we parted ways the way we were supposed to."\n\nThis was met only with a shake of the head from Virgilio. "We will not back down." He opened his mouth to speak further, but was interrupted by the hum of engines and the sound of tires over cobblestone as armored vehicles moved in to surround the square.\n\nThe gathered students took a tentative half-step back at the sound of the armored cars, but before Incelli could reply to the display, he was interrupted again by the whirring of rotors.\n\nConstantini squinted up towards the heavens, and muttered to himself with great incredulity in his voice. "...The machine gun might be overkill...""
hotautumn.66.a:0 "This has certainly escalated."

hotautumn.67.t:0 "Retreat"
hotautumn.67.d:0 "The field of battle was ready. The forces stood ready with their banners and flags, their helmets and weapons, their ranks and files. The only problem now was that the helmet, flag and baton stood across from armored cars, a helicopter, and machine guns.\n\n"Virgilio. Please." Came the last plea from Inspector Constantini, he had set down his own baton, though the gesture was awfully futile seeing as his words were still backed up by machine guns. "Just stand down."\n\nVirgilio looked towards the Inspector, and then back over his shoulder. He looked towards the rest of the FUAN, the fear on their faces as they watched the helicopter hover in the air, and the officers began to take cover behind the cars, discarding batons for firearms.\n\nConstantini looked back over his own shoulder, towards the questioning and uncertain faces of the security cordon. Would they have the bellies to fire on these students? Would the students actually be stupid enough to fight? He watched a man silently remove the magazine from his pistol, thinking that no one was watching, and he watched another consciously move to the side to create an avenue.\n\nTension filled the air, and all that it waited for was a single twitch, an errant movement, a single spark to set off the entire scene. But what it got instead, was the clatter of a stick against the cobbles, at the feet of Virgilio Incelli.\n\nHe had made a big show of casting down the weapon, before turning back towards his compatriots, who all at once filled the square with the noise of dropping wood, and the furling up of flags and banners. Some who stood without their weapons chose to cast down their helmets or throw off their gloves and armbands instead.\n\n"I think..." He began, projecting his voice to the gathered students. "We have made our point. The sun is setting, let's go home, before the keepers of the peace escalate the scene further." The venom in his voice could be felt throughout the square, even as officers backed off and away."
hotautumn.67.a:0 "A new miss..."

hotautumn.68.t:0 "Quiet"
hotautumn.68.d:0 "The mood in the FUAN headquarters was noticeably depressed when the rest of the leadership slinked in and found their chairs. Virgilio had been there for a short time, though he exaggerated his lounging position to make it look like he had been waiting for much longer. When they walked in, he slowly lowered his boots from the desk and leaned upright, hands folded over the table.\n\n"To say that did not go according to plan would be an understatement." Virgilio began, to the lukewarm mutterings of agreements from the rest of those in attendance.\n\n"Our image is going to take a while to recover." One of them replied.\n\nAnother spoke up as well. "And there's no way the police are going to allow us any more public gatherings after that display." He shook his head, practically trembling in anger. "And the media is already slandering us, as if we had been the ones responsible for-"\n\n"What has happened, has happened." Virgilio sighed, placing his hands on the desk and rising from his chair. "We can't change it, whether the demonstrations were a bad idea from the start or a good idea simply turned ill is entirely immaterial. What matters now..." He pointed a finger to the desk to emphasize his speech. "Is where we go from here." The gathered leaders fell silent as Virgilio did. They glanced between each other, and eagerly searched the ceiling and floor for the ever-elusive answer to the question, the question that was eventually vocalized. "So... Where do we go from here?" Virgilio stood up and looked around at the sullen faces of his compatriots. "The way I see it, there are only two directions we can go. Either we can keep doing this... participation thing that the democrats want from us, until we fade into the margins of history books and soon, off their pages entirely..."\n\nHe paused for effect, and to allow the chance for the darkness on their faces to lift, replaced by rage and frustration, that twisted their visages. He held up a fist as he continued. "Or we can change our tactics. They want to use guns? We'll use guns. They want lead? We'll fill the streets with it. If Italy must bleed so she can live, then so be it, but we will not allow our nation to perish under the faltering gaze of limp-wristed bureaucrats and vampiric politicians."\n\nAll at once, depression gave way to anger, and anger gave way to resolve. As one, the leadership of the FUAN stood and gave a Roman Salute. For Virgilio. For the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale. For Italia."

hotautumn.69.t:0 "A Morning at Work"
hotautumn.69.d:0 "Being a member of the Celere Units is not an easy job, and being an officer in them is even harder. The pay is little, the hours long. The screams, bottles, rocks, slogans thrown at you, hammering against your body while your men, standing by your side, entirely depend on you for orders and instruction. Communists, fascists, united by their hatred for you. The adrenaline mounting, the heartbeat pounding like drums, the charges, the batons falling, the smell of tear gas and water cannons, shouted orders, the intoxicating miasma of violence.\n\nLiving like this is not easy, and the downtime can be the hardest part sometimes. Showing up at the local commissariato at the break of dawn, exchanging small talk with coworkers over a cup of coffee, the endless stashes of paperwork. And while Milan burned, its police officers slaved away at paperwork, like nothing of note was happening outside. The units of the police and the Carabinieri were stretched thin across the city - Bicocca, the industrial area, is still ablaze with constant strikes and small scale riots, while the Statale, much closer to the city centre has been recently pacified, but trouble is still brewing under the ashes.\n\nInspector Adriano Constantini looked away from the papers, out of the window on the streets. The sky of Milan had that soft azure hue, so typical of the Lombard landscape. Adriano picked up the cigarettes from the desk, right next to his badge, and lit up one, smoking in long, slow drags. This was going to be a long day."

hotautumn.70.d:0 "For the past few days, a set of documents had been in common circulation regarding some strikes that were soon to take place. Today, however, he found that those dossiers had been replaced with a new set. "Milan FUAN 'Demonstrations and Rally'" was printed along the top, and it took the Inspector a few moments to figure out what it was referring to.\n\nThe students, the Mussolinites, that's right.\n\n"What's with the change in assignment?" Constantini asked, flopping the dossier on the neighboring desk of Ovidio, another Inspector in the Celere Unit. He started awake, almost tipping over his lukewarm coffee at the sound of the paper meeting desk.\n\n"Oh, the strike?" Ovidio muttered, adjusting his glasses and wiping something from his mouth with a sleeve.\n\n"It says here that it's a uh... A demonstration." Constantini pointed out. "Why did we get switched over from the Pirelli?"\n\nOvidio shrugged as he looked over the dossier. "They can't call it a strike I guess, because they're students, not workers. Dunno who would panic about the books going unread for an evening, so they gotta give it a different name." He leaned back in his chair and handed the dossier back to Constantini. "They asked for a cordon last-second. I guess we were the only unit they could send."\n\nConstantini glowered down at the dossier and shook his head. "You'd think that a bunch of Fascists proclaiming their strength or whatever would handle their security themselves." Though as he spoke, he realized how glad he was that they weren't taking such matters into their own hands, for once.\n\nOvidio's reply mirrored his own internal dialogue. "Better us doing it than them. They're Nazis in all but name, they'd be certain to overreact if any of the Union men confronted them, and we'd have to go in anyway." He kicked his feet up on the desk, risking that lukewarm cup of coffee once more, and relaxed his hands behind his head. "Better we be there to keep the children from hurting themselves, am I right?"\n\n"I'm a police officer, not a babysitter."\n\n"You act like there's a difference.""

hotautumn.71.d:0 "Another day, another mountain of paperwork done, and yet the amount never seemed to end. Inspector Constantini put down the remnants of the last cigarette in the ashtray, letting out a long sigh. Days like these were boring, but a welcome moment of quiet after the chaos of the last period. As the inspector prepared to leave for home, the phone on his desk rang, echoing through the almost empty corridors of the local commissariat.\n\n"The orders have been changed, inspector Constantini" the voice on the other end of the line said. Receiving a direct call from the commissar was not a common occurrence, especially at such a late time of the hour. "Your men won't be needed at Pirelli tomorrow." A major strike was planned, and Constantini with his unit was supposed to be part of the security cordon. "Also, all documents regarding the Pirelli situation have been placed outside your clearance level." The call abruptly ended, and Constantini stood with the phone in his hand as it beeped, without even having the time of saying "yes, sir."\n\nThis was far from ordinary. The Celere Unit was never one devoted to investigation, and instead was the rank and file of the police - the grunts who do the dirty work. And yet, something went off in Constantini's mind. Why would the plans change, all of a sudden? And why remove dossiers that were commonly circulating until only hours ago? As Constantini was walking home, his mind raced. Perhaps it's nothing, but it might be worth asking around tomorrow at the commissariat."
hotautumn.71.a:0 "A cop must obey orders without question."

hotautumn.72.t:0 "Strange Information"
hotautumn.72.d:0 "Inspector Constantini hung up the phone, and the room was once again filled with silence. And yet, his mind was racing, echoing with the voices he heard in the last round of phone calls. San Donato, Rogoredo, Sesto San Giovanni - from his colleagues and friends in almost every single working class district of Milan, similar news could be heard. Orders changing suddenly and seemingly with no rhyme or reason - experienced officers replaced with new people from outside the city - and the plans to contain the disorders, carefully crafted by the local commissars of the Polizia, being scrapped in favour of much more dubious ones.\n\nThe upper command of the Polizia proved its lack of competence or knowledge of the situation on the ground many times before, but such egregious mistakes were simply unprecedented. Constantini looked at the large map of Milan hanging in his office - a pentagon shaped mass of a city, apparently twisting and turning, its roads and streets intersecting at strange angles to mark where the many different overlords of Milan started to shape it in their image during the city's long history. All around the city centres, the districts where the strikes and disorders were most prominent, all marked in red, stretching like a ring of fire around the white blot in the city centre - the Duomo, San Babila, the Statale.\n\nThe current plan to deploy the police forces was a tragedy waiting to happen. The Celere units were ordered to take positions in bottlenecks and narrow streets, where there'd be no way to effectively contain the riots and a violent, head on clash would be inevitable. Somebody upstairs was doing his job outstandingly poorly, and something had to be done before the inevitable happened."

hotautumn.73.t:0 "Rumors from Above"
hotautumn.73.d:0 "Corruption in the police is a strange subject - even before that word appeared in Constantini's mind, the mere smell of that concept, its vague precognition, caused a sort of freeze reaction. And yet, there were few other explanations to the series of egregious mistakes the police command of Milan was committing, and none of them very plausible. Somebody, somewhere, was consciously and deliberately setting up a massacre in the streets of Milan, presumably with some sort of other goal.\n\nPolitics and police are a pairing which often made its appearance in some shape or form - but for the first time, inspector Constantini was directly involved. His men were on the front line in Milan - they would likely be the ones forced to kill, or be killed. And yet there was very little Constantini could do - the only things he had were rumours, conjectures, not conclusive evidence. And even then, what could a lowly inspector do against something happening above him in the chain of command?\n\nStill, another question was how and why somebody was trying to cause a violent escalation of the already tense situation in the city. The most obvious culprits would be the communists - by making violence increase, they could paint their own dead as martyrs and further gain popularity among the masses. But the police was not exactly known for its communist sympathies, and it could also be that some sort of right wing organization was attempting to cause the death of a policeman or two, in order to justify a harsher crackdown on leftist violence. It could even be organized crime, attempting to cause further chaos in order to keep the police busy, leaving them free to do their business. Or maybe it was all a complicated ploy by the police command, who was hoping to gain a martyr in order to be able to ask for more funding from the government. Constantini's mind buzzed with possibilities and conspiracies forming and dissolving in the span of seconds, against the backdrop of rising frustration, anger, and fear."
hotautumn.73.a:0 "It can only be hoped that these are all just baseless conjectures."

hotautumn.74.t:0 "Growing Suspicions"
hotautumn.74.d:0 "Constantini turned off his tv, a cheap new model purchased by gutting his last paycheck, and drew a long sigh. Newspapers, from L'Unità to the Corriere, and RAI broadcasts over radio and televisions all told the same story. In the evening of yesterday, the police clashed with rioters and protesters in Sesto San Giovanni. Zhdanov cocktails and rocks were being hurled against the police like drops of rain, as what seemed like entire legions of angry, dispossessed workers, university aged would-be revolutionaries, and even women and children from the poor parts of Sesto pressed against the police. Eventually, the police was unable to contain the riot, and ordered a counter charge to repress the chaos.\n\nIt was like fingers snapping, and then for one second it was silence. Water cannons, tear gas, screams, batons falling on skulls - the police charged. Finally, gunfire. Policemen had opened fire on the crowd with live ammunition, leaving several people lying dead or wounded on the streets - and then, someone fired back. A policeman dropped to the ground, a puddle of blood forming around him as he wheezed his last breath while his comrades tried to remove him from the streets. More policemen were wounded, but at least the crowd was dispersed, as in what seemed like seconds the people fled in all directions, into buildings, narrow roads, and some seeming to vanish into thin air. Soon, only the macabre spectacle of a devastated street, with smoke, bodies, and burning cars, was left to the eye of the policemen, and of the press.\n\nAs predicted, the scandal was huge. Politicians from even the most unsuspectingly moderate parts of the political landscape were lamenting the deaths of so many people, and calling for more funds being directed towards the police and more extraordinary powers going their way. The most respectable members of the upper echelons of Italian high society were disgusted at the awful display of violence Italy had become a theater of, and wished for a return to orderly and quiet life in which workers and students would just behave like good citizens of the kingdom. The right wing was starting to openly remind the Italian people that things like these didn't happen in an earlier, more orderly time. And Constantini sat in his living room, staring at the ceiling, with that familiar buzzing sensation in his mind."

Under their stony visage, many had several emotions agitating their thoughts - anger, sadness, and a remarkable feeling that their friend's death was entirely avoidable.\n\nInspector Constantini was also present at the funeral, in his uniform, but far from the first rows of the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie - going unnoticed among the crowd as Milan's archbishop delivered his somber sermon. While saddened by the death of his colleague, Constantini did not attend the funeral out of a desire to pay his respects, but for a more personal reason. He wished to meet an old friend of his - also an inspector, attached to the police unit present at the riot in Sesto San Giovanni. Perhaps he could give more answers.\n\nAs the archbishop gave his final blessings and the coffin was escorted out of the church, the crowd started to slowly disperse, piece by piece, in the busy, crowded streets of Milan. In the noise, Constantini managed to reach his friend, who had a stern look on his face. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, fitting for two old acquaintances meeting at a funeral, Constantini began asking questions - who gave the orders that resulted in a senseless death, and why?

hotautumn.77.t:0 "The Fires of Biocca"
hotautumn.77.d:0 "In normal times, the Bicocca district of Milan was surprisingly calm despite its industrial nature. It was filled with bustle but never raucous; echoing with thousands of the footsteps of laborers, young and old, but never so obnoxiously that it brought the storied city any shame. As the dawn began to shine upon the many steel and concrete beasts that housed the beating heart of the city's economy, there was, as usual, a fair amount of noise, but it was not the pleasant kind that indicated work was carrying on as usual. Instead, shouts of rage and the crackling of flame consumed this national center of educational and economic achievement. Such riots were all too common in these uncertain times, Inspector Constantini reflected as he deliberately adjusted the holster containing his standard-issued firearm for maximum visibility, but what worried the seasoned officer was the sheer scale of the conflagration that was currently consuming most of the quarter at the moment. The entire city's police force had been mobilized the previous night, and he had heard from a friend in the security ministry that special riot units were being deployed from as far away as Calabria to help suppress the riot before it became an even bigger embarrassment to the nation.\n\nNot that it would probably help much, the Inspector thought grimly as he stepped into a waiting car with a fellow inspector and a beat sergeant who explained that he had been called up to help direct the out of town reinforcements to their designated locations.\n\nThe trip to the edge of the riot was spent mostly in quiet, which was fine as far as Constantini was concerned, he wasn't really in the mood for talking. Only two incidents of note interrupted the drive. Above the background din of riotous jeers and the broadcast demands of the city and police officials, the crack of gunfire pierced through the morning air. The inspector vaguely remembered having been told that the rioters did not have any firearms. It seemed that supposition was now out of the window. The second incident did not involve gunfire, but was far more worrying in its own way. As the car began to slow down as it approached ever nearer to the blocks where the rioters made their voices heard, the sergeant related an uncomfortable piece of office gossip: several known anarchists and radicals who had been under the government's watch had all seemingly slipped off their handlers and were, at present, unable to be found."

hotautumn.78.t:0 "The Shot"
hotautumn.78.d:0 "A raging mass of rioters surged once more against the line of police that, while determined and substantially armed and armored, was growing more outnumbered by the hour. Most of those facing off against these enforcers of order were laborers native to industrial Bicocca who had finally broken under the backwards labor policies still common in factories across the nation. Some were young, well educated students, believers in the theories of Marx and Engels, idealistic rebels against the system they had grown up into, the system they were certain was a broken mess. A few key figures, dispersed throughout the sea of discontent, stood out starkly from the older men in working clothes and the students in the fashions of the day. These gentlemen were grim, grey faced and dark-eyed; some bore distinct scars and all wore outfits as badly worn as the most overworked of the factory men. The police, blind as they were to the happenings within the riot's territory, had no idea that it was these determined and militant pugilists who were at present building up the rioters' fury and passions with their denouncements of the rich and powerful.\n\nDespite the tough talk from the hardliners within the crowd, the general mood of the assembled discontented citizens seemed to be cooling as the sun progressed in its upward journey. At least, so it seemed to Mario Calabrò as he watched one cluster of students trickle out from their peers and surrender to the waiting police. He could hardly fault them, they were hardly more than children after all, and even his deep commitment to the protest he had willingly joined couldn't stop him from worrying for the safety of his young comrades who were not much older than his eldest son. Still, it seemed as if not everyone felt the same way, and his heart sank at seeing how this small defeat had engaged the greater mass once again into anger and action, only this time it was not righteous fury directed against the capitalist and fascists bastardi but towards some youths who had made what was likely a sensible choice for their own safety. Men like Calabró had nothing much left to live for, but those students still had a future if they were smart enough not to waste it. One of the apparent ringleaders of the rioters hurled particularly vicious insults at the departing deffectors, and before he was given a chance to remunerate the scoundrel, the agitator drew a pistol and fired a single shot."

hotautumn.79.d:0 "Inspector Constantini felt a splatter of something liquid slap his face with enough force to make his eyes shut involuntarily. When he reopened them, the riot officer he had been conversing with mere seconds ago was on the ground and bleeding uncontrollably from a wound in his shoulder. The mass of police and rioters turned slowly, almost apprehensively, as the inspector's urgent calls for medical attention began to sound through the packed street as everything seemed to grow ominously silent. As the inspector waited tensley for any sight of responding medical personnel, something caught his attention from his peripheral vision. A group of rioters who had up until that point been almost up against the protective shields of the police were now backing away, slowly and without any fanfare, but they were backing away. Perhaps the rioters were coming to their senses, and maybe, just maybe one incident of tragic violence would prove to be a blessing in disguise. The Inspector was considering this as one of the officers across from the falling-back rioters took a slow, deliberate step forward.\n\nHe could see exactly what was about to happen, see it as if it had already happened and there was nothing he could do to prevent it. He could prevent it though, if he could only get there in time. The only problem was the man bleeding out in front of him. Leaving him unattended to cost the officer his life, and it would be Constantini's fault. The choice was painfully clear, and the answer, unfortunately, was equally so.\n\nHe was running as fast as his legs would carry him to the advancing officer, waving his arms, calling for him to stay put, but in the end he was too late. A brutal shove from the officer's riot control shield sent one of the rioters sprawling on the ground, blood pooling from the back of their head where it had cracked against the street. Another long moment of silence followed, and then with cries of mingled rage, resentment, and even fear, the line of police disintegrated into a counter-mob hell-bent of punishing the riot with any means necessary to avenge their fallen brother. Adriano Constantini could only look on in horror at the unfurling violence."

hotautumn.80.t:0 "The Fire Rises"
hotautumn.80.d:0 "Inspector Constantini never imagined he would hear such sounds outside of the Final Judgement, although at that precise moment, he was half convinced that that was what he was witnessing. Any semblance of order was rapidly dissolving as the riot police charged with the reckless abandon of rage and fear. They were met with an ever-increasing amount of gunfire from previously concealed firearms. If the rioters had not premeditated such violence, it was clear to the inspector that they had been prepared. The shots, however, were not all coming from the side of the rioters. Constantini looked to the rooftops of the surrounding buildings and spied at least half a dozen police sharpshooters, all of them either firing or picking targets.\n\nConstantini turned in the direction of the mobile headquarters, preparing to sprint the few blocks separating him from a chance to find someone able to restore order. The sound of an explosion and second later a chorus of cries to rival the damned stopped the veteran officer where he stood. Pale, he turned slowly around to face the source, and was met by flames rising from a score of buildings, creating a corridor of fire surrounding protests and police alike. Of course, the inspector realized, the protestors had been armed from the beginning, and guns were not the only weapon a rioter would come prepared with. He caught the glint of light as another Zhdanov cocktail sailed in an arc that seemed almost lazy, like it was no more a tool of chaos and death than a football. It flew into a storefront window and the facade was alight almost instantly. The gunfire had slowed for a fleeting moment after the first few buildings went up, but it was now starting up once more in earnest. The pops of small pistols from the rioters and the cracks from police rifles created a terrible harmony of destruction and violence. If anyone had the power to stop this, the window to do so was closing quickly. Trying not to think about the pain and death he was essentially fleeing from like a coward, Constantini took off for the headquarters unit. Maybe they would have an answer he told himself; maybe they would have a contingency already prepared; maybe; maybe; maybe. The word rattled around in his mind as he pushed his legs to move faster."
hotautumn.80.a:0 "Can anyone stop this madness?"

hotautumn.81.t:0 "No Good Deed..."
hotautumn.81.d:0 "At first, Mario had not believed that the police would allow the block to burn. Surely, he reasoned, they would call off the mob, and the police really had descended into a mob by this point, and allowed the protestors to disperse without further violence to allow fire teams to save what they could from the conflagration. He soon realized how naive he truly was. The police were by this point in no more control of their emotions than the rioters had just before the officer was shot. Mario Calabro was a peaceful man, a family man, but in his deepest heart he had to admit to himself that if he had the chance to get ahold of the scoundrel who fired that deadly shot, he would not be responsible for his next actions. Despite the not insignificant desire to exact justice upon the guilty man, all Mario was really focusing on was finding a way to escape the chaos and return to his family.\n\nThe police seemed hellbent on making that as difficult as possible however. He could faintly see through the smoke and to the tops of several of the non-burning buildings farther back. There were at least half a dozen sharpshooters perched atop them like gargoyles, and every few minutes one would fire a shot in the direction of the riot. Most of the time the shot cracked pavement or road. Most times. The way he had come into the street was in hostile hands as it were, and so Mario scanned in the opposite direction. While free of snipers, that way was no less anarchic with the masses of fleeing protestors who were attempting to make a desperate stand against the better armed police away from the fires. Dangerous as it was, Mario had little choice, and he began moving as quickly as he could without inviting unwanted attention onto himself.\n\nDown at this end of the street there was no fire or smoke, but that only meant that those with firearms had clearer sights to kill with. Bodies already littered the ground and wounded men and women roiled in agony on sidewalks or slunk into alleys only to collapse alone. Mario saw just this happen to a boy no older than sixteen, and his fatherly instinct compelled him to step in. He had made it within a few meters of the alleyway entrance when the screams began to intensify. Shots and canisters of gas whizzed by Mario's head and his resolve faltered, a nearby building's open door seemed to invite him in to weather this storm, but that would mean abandoning the injured young man."

hotautumn.82.d:0 "The world seemed to sway and dip in slow motion as Mario Calabro first slumped, then collapsed, against the wall; a smear of blood from where the man's head had slid followed the body down to the cold ground. For a moment, or perhaps several for Mario could no longer sense the passage of time, there was an all encompassing blackness. Muffled shouts, muted crashes, and even the sound of gunshots from what felt like blocks away assailed the ears of the ill-fated laborer. From a foggy corner of his mind, Calabro wondered if it was due to the almost guaranteed concussion or if the violence had actually moved, and he began to wonder which option concerned him more, but the complex thought proved impossible to keep and it dissolved.\n\nHe opened his eyes when he felt the warm metal touch his cheek, and with his first sight since falling to the ground, Mario Calabro witnessed a vision of hell. He was not the only one lying on the ground, there were at least a dozen others. Some were groaning and attempting to crawl away or squirming meekly like birds with broken wings. Several, however, lay still and showed no signs of consciousness or even life. With an effort, he cast his eyes around his immediate surroundings. He saw several spent bullet casings strewn around the area, and realized it had been one of them that had hit his face. An empty gas canister lay near his feet, a blood-splattered dent clearly visible.\n\nHe thought about his wife, who would have to somehow navigate life without a husband. He thought about his children, who would have to grow up without their father. What had he or his family done to deserve such punishment? He wondered if he would receive any answers in the end, or if all would be consigned to oblivion. His hand felt heavy and numb, but he managed to place it into his pants pocket, and trembling, withdrew a worn photograph. Mario Calabro looked intently at this precious image, smiled weakly, and died."

hotautumn.83.d:0 "With a rising horror Mario Calabro watched as the young student, a boy in his early twenties by his appearance, clutched his side as dark red blood began seeping down his shirt, then his trouser leg, and finally puddled at his feet. By the time the youth fell, already beyond saving, to the ground, the crowd had discerned the location where the shot's effect had landed. However, as far as Mario could tell, none besides himself had actually seen the shooter from his obscured position. It occured to the unlucky worker that without a clear idea of the real culprit, the already agitated mass of protestors would naturally rally against... He spun, and began to wave wildly around in an attempt to alert the others as to what he had just witnessed but things were already moving out of anyone one person's control.\n\nThe frustration and anger that had already been pent up inside the people from not just this protest but countless others and behind that, the economic uncertainty forever looming in the dark like some boogeyman, finally seemed to be spilling out. Clusters of the riot control officers were being faced down by dozens of approaching workers and students armed with sticks and pipes. Rocks began to pelt the protective shields which were the only thing protecting the officers from the enraged crowd. Things were going to get ugly, and get ugly very soon.\n\nSome of the police seemed ready to hold their ground to the bitter end, insane as the idea seemed to Mario, while others were already buckling under the pressure and giving ground quickly. He watched from the entrance to an alleyway, unwilling to directly participate but equally unwilling to leave before seeing the conclusion of such dramatic events. It was clear enough to him that the police were taken completely off-guard by the shooting and were in total confusion as to how to respond. He prayed silently that they would just retreat before any more blood was spilled."

hotautumn.84.d:0 "The Inspector had no intention of letting things advance any farther than they already had. The protest was quickly devolving into a riot with the death of that young man and there was a real possibility that major violence could erupt at any minute. The police had to pull back, Constantini was convinced, if there was to be any hope of a cool-off happening. That was why he ran down the blocks to the temporary headquarters with an intensity he hadn't displayed since the academy all those years ago. He had handled situations of life and death before, it was true, but he had never been so sure that the fate of hundreds of lives were hanging in the balance as he did now. There was no time to spare.\n\nThe mobile headquarters unit had changed in the relatively short time he had been away at the front lines of the protest. Several portable barriers had been erected blocking easy access to the tents and armored command vehicle that had been borrowed from the army. Around the perimeter, armed officers stood at the ready with rifles and at each tent entrance there were two sentries posted with machine guns. Apparently the brass was getting mighty paranoid, but given the situation Constantini had just left, he could hardly blame them. The tent farthest back was likely where the police chief and his aides were coordinating the response. The inspector jogged up to the tent's guards and flashed his identification before disappearing inside without waiting for their response.\n\nThe chief looked pale and exhausted, and for Constantini, seeing the normally resolute and unflappable man reduced to this state frightened him more than any mob ever could. When he had entered, the head of Milan's police was in rapid fire conversation with one of his subordinates, but the Inspector's sudden appearance in the tent halted that conversation as all eyes turned toward this newcomer. Not wanting to waste any of the precious time he had, Constantini took advantage of this and began to address the chief directly. He had one shot to convince the man that pulling out would prevent further escalation, and he would need to speak quickly."
hotautumn.84.a:0 "Time is running out!"

hotautumn.85.t:0 "The Silent Stand"
hotautumn.85.d:0 "Constantini watched from a distance as the line of officers, once more adhering to their discipline and bolstered by the men on either side, reformed the tight shield wall that they had begun this fiasco in. He silently thanked God for giving his tongue the power to persuade the chief that this was the right course of action. He had been met with initial resistance of course, none of the brass had been happy at the thought of appearing to retreat in the face of a riot. He had, luckily, been able to persuade them that keeping the police where they were would only allow the mob to encircle and destroy the riot officers and that would look even worse for the city.\n\nFor a group that had just been surrounded by scared, angry rioters eager to exact vengeance, Constantini thought the men were doing a damn good job of keeping it together. Most of the protestors, for their part, were letting the police pull put unmolested. Most of the mass had been young students and workers with families to feed, not exactly the picture of zealous fanatics willing to risk life and limb for an already finished battle. Still, there were some shady characters peeking out from the front of the crowd. They looked like they could be trouble if left unwatched, so Constantini motioned a nearby lieutenant to make sure that didn't happen. He paused long enough to make sure the instructions were relayed properly down the line -- he didn't want a trigger happy sniper getting the wrong idea and ruining everything -- and then he began to walk briskly but calmly back to the site of the mobile headquarters.\n\nThey had packed away the tents when he arrived and were beginning to load the last of the equipment into the armored vehicle. The car he had rode from the station was nowhere in sight, so the Inspector pulled himself into what seemed to him to be one of the most uncomfortable seats ever devised by man. It reminded him, he realized, of the days he had ridden in another machine quite like this one, back during the war. He was a young man himself then, no older than most of those students. He wondered, idly, if those kids would one day reflect on this protest as merely a half forgotten piece of some long, grueling war."

hotautumn.86.d:0 "The night was a cloudless one, and silver-white ribbons of light cascaded into the still, silent offices of the Milan police headquarters. Except, the offices were not quite empty, not yet anyways. Inspector Adriano Constantini took another sip from a cup of black coffee as he attempted to fight off the oncoming fatigue. Only a little bit longer, he thought to himself as he pulled another piece of paper from the pile sitting atop his desk like some ancient Roman temple. Only a little more and then that will be it for tonight. Having been heavily involved in the incident the papers were now almost exclusively referring to as the "Bicocca Fire", it was to be expected that the Inspector would have a good deal of paperwork to work through. Expected, and annoying as hell.\n\nStill, the mountianload of reports he was being forced to fill out were probably going to be helpful in the very near future. As officials all over the country from Sicily to Venice were discovering, stamping out one flame would not be enough. Given that tensions in the country were running so high they could be cut with a knife, perhaps they should not have been surprised when similar demonstrations began to pop up in most major cities with industrial centers. Even when those were put down, some more peaceful than others, things did not improve. In fact, the riots and protests were merely the beginning. The political factions of Italy were mobilizing for something big, he was sure. The socialists cheered on such displays of disobedience while the remnant fascists and conversative blocs railed against the 'death of civilization' and the foreign saboteurs some claimed were behind it all. The moderates were having their own hell of time in even trying to figure out what message to put forward. It was, in a word, chaos.\n\nConstantini looked at the clock and blinked, then rubbed his eyes before checking again. He had spent almost an hour in his own thoughts all the while doing nothing to reduce the number of unfinished reports still on his desk. The old cop sighed and glanced at the empty cup. As if in response, a yawn came to his lips and passed unheard by anyone except himself. There was no use staying any longer, the papers would still be there the next morning. The chaos too would greet him in the morning, like an old friend."

There had been a noticeable change, however, in the quantity and quality of the supplies he would get since the beginning of the war.

His previous pleas for weapons, armor, aircraft, anything at all meant to help the war effort were met with nothing but vague promises of "additional support," from his Libyan superiors. That is, of course, if he wasn't outright ignored. He knew that the current situation was unsustainable: every gun lost to the scorching desert sands was one that wouldn't be fighting against the advancing Iberian forces, or repelling the ever-increasing bandit hordes targeting his scant supply convoys. Appealing to his superiors just hadn't been working; he needed a new strategy. Dialing a number of senior officials in the PNF, he was prepared to explain the situation and make yet another plea for supplies — suddenly, the phone line connected.\n\n"What the hell are you doing, Castellano?"
