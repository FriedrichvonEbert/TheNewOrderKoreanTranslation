NPP의 통합 전선에서 균열이 나타나기 시작하고 있으며, 각 카운티에서 주까지 공화-민주당은 이미 그의 입법을 확고히 하기로 약속했습니다. 하지만 미국의 억압받는 사람들은 이제 그들이 그의 형제에게 했던 것처럼 그에게 희망을 바라봅니다. 잭이 마지막 순간에도 결코 그만두지 않았고, 바비 역시 그만두지 않을 것입니다."

RFK는 특히 그들의 사회 자유주의 정책과 복지 국가에 대한 진보적인 견해를 놓고 공화당과 협력하겠다는 새로운 정책을 발표했습니다. 공화당은 본질적으로 그들이 할 수 있는 어떤 과단성에도 응할 수 밖에 없는 상황에서 케네디의 관대한 손을 간절하게 움켜쥐었습니다. 이제 NPP와 공화당이 손잡고 일하면서 우리는 마침내 옛 미국 정치의 죽음의 고비를 잠재울 수 있습니다."

Tense negotiations in the dead of night, dim lamplight and lit cigars illuminating sheets of paper crisscrossed by red ink. Speech after tiring speech in a hundred cities, thousands of hours drained away, all to harden wills, turn hearts and sow doubt. Few but for the NPP's far-sighted envisioned that the day our efforts bear fruit would come -- yet here it is, in its sempiternal glory.\n\nOur past acts have flirted with, but not quite achieved, the concept of universal healthcare: total coverage for all citizens, free of charge. Years prior, even some within the party would balk at the costs involved for such a program, let alone the wisdom of granting free and unrestricted healthcare paid for by the federal government. But the administration persisted, slowly winning hearts and votes, until the National Healthcare Act finally stands before Congress, ready to be judged for its worth. If passed, the mechanisms for the most robust universal healthcare system in the world shall soon be put into place.\n\nThis is a significant victory for both American democracy and the people it serves. Whatever happens, congratulations for having reached this point."

Voting Americans now approach the ballot boxes confident that their voice will be heard in the halls of Congress.\n\nWhat no one can fathom that fateful day in '64 has been realized in under a decade, enriching the American's life and freedom like never before.

Among the honored dead count his own brother, John Kennedy. Deprived of life by a madman's barrel, he had nevertheless kept America from bleeding further after the bastard Nixon tore bloody gashes at its neck. Most importantly he restored faith in America's democratic institutions following Nixon, overseeing what would have been a return to normalcy; indeed, many believe he would have succeeded and more had tragedy not struck as it had.\n\nJack had always been a vocal believer in doing what was right. No doubt about it: he would have been proud of Bobby were he alive to see what his little brother had accomplished.\n\nThe President has scheduled a short trip to his brother's resting place.

Obstacles remain for the colored man to hurdle, ones which had centuries to entrench themselves into the American system. Invisible or otherwise, they pervade and corrupt the very institutions which proclaim to deliver liberty and justice for all.\n\nFor now, we shall revel in this seminal moment in America's history.

As pressure mounts both within and without the NPP for President Kennedy to pass the Civil Rights Act -- whether to succeed or to fail -- negotiating with the Republican-Democrats becomes an increasingly attractive option.\n\nBut compromise entails sacrificing principle for convenience. For a Party long defined by its commitment to its own agenda, the former is something it cannot afford.\n\nLet the Republican-Democrats stew in their own hypocrisy. The NPP can march forward to the future simply with the support of its ranks and the integrity of its Congressmen."

It stays true to the words it enshrines, offering wide-ranging guarantees to all Americans irrespective of race, faith, sex, and creed -- desegregation in both public and private establishments, workforce quotas, abolishment of poll taxes and literacy tests -- duly enforced by the federal government.\n\nDespite protestations against "forcing the Act through without sufficient discussion" echoing in both aisles of Congress, President Kennedy could not have asked for a better bill. Getting the votes to ensure its passage is still an obstacle to hurdle, however, and whether or not he can ever ink his signature on the first page remains to be seen."

 ###### BIPARTISANSHIP EVENTS


 bobby.bipartisan.1.t:0 "The Beginning of a Beautiful Friendship"
 bobby.bipartisan.1.desc:0 "America is divided more than ever, on seemingly every issue-- economic policy, military interventions, civil rights, and just about whatever else you can fit on the nightly news. Now more than ever, however, we must bring Americans together, and create a more free, equal America.\n\nThat said, a "free, equal America" requires a lot of work to turn from fantasy to fact. The first step is securing bipartisan support in Congress, and our best bet is some kind of coalition with the more liberal Republicans. Let's show the Republicans that our values are quite similar by working on a War Powers Act together, which would limit the President's power to unilaterally plunge America into war, like in South Africa.\n\nIf they learn to like working with us on this, support for a future Civil Rights Act would be almost guaranteed!"
 bobby.bipartisan.1.a:0 "We must keep the prize in sight."

 bobby.bipartisan.2.t:0 "The First Draft"
 bobby.bipartisan.2.desc:0 "Congress, and really all of politics, is a tricky game: How far do you push your morals in favor of pragmatism, what's a vote really worth, and more.\n\nWith this bill, we're faced with a certain decision we must make as we draft the WPA. Do we make the Act as clear and direct and possible, or do we leave a few loopholes here and there? Making an airtight bill would certainly be the more moral choice and perhaps be the most popular, but if we leave even a few loopholes we could satisfy some of the warhawks in Congress."
 bobby.bipartisan.2.a:0 "Sometimes we have to focus more on what's realistic rather than what's right."
 bobby.bipartisan.2.b:0 "We came here to prevent another South Africa. Close the loopholes. "

 bobby.bipartisan.3.t:0 "The Democratic Ambush"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.desc:0 "Some of the Democrats in Congress have sprung an amendment onto the War Powers Act! They want to let the President send "training forces" without needing Congressional approval. If we let this amendment through, the whole Act becomes meaningless, since the President could still just send whatever forces he wanted under the guise of his "training forces"!\n\nAt the same time however, if we did let this amendment through, we could count on a much larger base of support in Congress.\n\nWhat should we do about this?"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.a:0 "The hell are they doing, absolutely not!"
 bobby.bipartisan.3.b:0 "Well, it couldn't hurt to have a bigger majority."

 bobby.bipartisan.4.t:0 "The Democrats Speak Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.4.desc:0 "After our refusal to incorporate their amendment, the Democrats have raised a major stink nationwide, and the latest numbers seem to suggest it has affected our polling.\nHowever, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Although the Democrats are throwing their little tantrums, the Republicans are publicly applauding us for sticking to our guns, and LBJ even called to say congratulations! Who knew such a dreadful man had a heart!"
 bobby.bipartisan.4.a:0 "The Republicans are all that matter."

 bobby.bipartisan.5.t:0 "The End of the Honeymoon"
 bobby.bipartisan.5.desc:0 "Some diehard dove Republicans have raised hell over our decision to incorporate the Democratic amendment in the War Powers Act. For now, these Republicans are mostly on the fringe, but it could spell disaster down the line. We can't go back on the promise to go for the Democratic amendment, but we do have to make sure that we don't rock the boat too much in the future so our coalition stays secure. We need to make sure the Republicans can and do trust us!"
 bobby.bipartisan.5.a:0 "So much for reaching across the aisle..."

 bobby.bipartisan.6.t:0 "The Passing of the War Powers Act"
 bobby.bipartisan.6.desc:0 "With the recent Senate vote, the War Powers Act is on its way to Robert's desk, which means a victory for us and our coalition. Hypothetically, this should mean that we've achieved a great success for bipartisanship in America, but it just seems like we've dug the party trenches even deeper. We set out not only to prevent another South Africa, but to show America how to work together again, and while we got the job done in the end, the cracks we got along the way are worrying.\n\nStill, what's done is done, and we must look towards the future and not the past. There will likely be another opportunity to showcase bipartisanism soon, and to guarantee the Republicans that we're the people to work with when it comes to civil rights."
 bobby.bipartisan.6.a:0 "A win is a win, onto the next bill."

 bobby.bipartisan.7.t:0 "Grumbles in the NPP-FR"
 bobby.bipartisan.7.desc:0 "Some far right members of the NPP are complaining that we give the executive branch too much power in the War Powers Act-- they fear that we'll do the same when it comes to civil rights, which they view as undue government tyranny.\n\nThis is, of course, absurd, but we could count on more complete Congressional support if we alter the language of the Act somewhat, even if we might scare off a few Republicans."
 bobby.bipartisan.7.a:0 "Well, a little alteration couldn't hurt."
 bobby.bipartisan.7.b:0 "We can't go back now, send the bill to the floor."

 bobby.bipartisan.8.t:0 "The Elephant Blows its Trunk"
 bobby.bipartisan.8.desc:0 "After altering the language of the War Powers Act to please the NPP-FR, the Republicans are worried we'll just bend over to the NPP-FR when it comes to civil rights! They're concerned we won't stick to our guns and get a square deal for all Americans, with LBJ himself trumpeting this line from every talk show in the nation. Unfortunately, it's too late to back out of the alterations, but hopefully the Act will still make it out of Congress with the new FR support. This does not bode well for our future cooperation."
 bobby.bipartisan.8.a:0 "Why does bipartisanship have to be so hard?"

 bobby.bipartisan.9.t:0 "The Right Speaks Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.9.desc:0 "Our recent refusal to tone down the War Powers Act in accordance with the NPP-FR demand to alter the language of the Act has earned us some respect with anti-segregationists and civil rights leaders, but it has also led to Strom Thurmond and George Wallace decrying our so called "undignified, callous, and immature conduct.'' Thankfully, this hasn't led to any serious implications, and what limited impact it has led to will most likely fade with time. We have even had some of our Republican colleagues speak out to the press in support of our Administration after refusing to let them in."
 bobby.bipartisan.9.a:0 "Why does bipartisanship have to be so damn hard?"

 bobby.bipartisan.10.t:0 "Drafting the Enviromental Protections Act"
 bobby.bipartisan.10.desc:0 "America has always been a land of progress, with each new era bringing new innovations and opportunities through the wonders of science and industry. But progress comes with a cost. The ravages of unchecked development has waged devastation upon the great beauty of nature, and the skies choke with smog just as the land lies awash with waste. Something must be done to ensure that we do not squander the bounty of our great country.\nOur newest bill would introduce a slew of environmental protections and regulations aimed at reducing the impact of human development on the natural world. Businesses and government institutions would be encouraged to monitor and reduce their reliance on polluting chemicals, inefficient practices and irresponsible waste disposal, among other such ills. Certain incentives to help encourage the adoption of green policies are also included in the bill, including increased taxation on pollutive products and subsidies for organizations that adopt environmentally-friendly initiatives.\nBefore we submit this bill, we must figure out our strategy. Our cooperation with the Republican-Democrats has presented an opportunity we may be able to exploit in this matter. A number of Democrat senators have expressed a great passion for the cause of environmental protection, and if we were to offer them a seat at the table to help draft the bill, we could shore up their support for when it comes time to vote. On the other hand, their passion may prove rather... counterproductive, as they will certainly request that we include even stronger protections that may not prove as palatable to the rest of the government.\nThe decision lies with President Kennedy, who is willing to pursue any avenue in the interests of defending America's natural beauty."
 bobby.bipartisan.10.a:0 "Invite the Democrats to the table!"
 bobby.bipartisan.10.b:0 "In times like this, it's best to be safe."

 bobby.bipartisan.11.t:0 "A Firmer Hand on the Environment"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.desc:0 "The Democrats have been eager to work with us in developing the Environmental Act, and lengthy discussions about the bill's contents have taken place over the last few days. As expected, however, our decision to include them may come at a cost.\nWhile they have welcomed the protections offered by the bill, the Democrats say they do not go far enough, for they claim that sufficiently wealthy and powerful organizations would freely be able to ignore the regulations if the profit remained sufficient. Rather than a carrot, we need a stick, they say. Among their proposed amendments include rendering certain particularly ecologically-damaging practices illegal, with significant fines and sanctions for those companies who continue to engage in them. In addition, they also seek the creation of a government watchdog that would be able to investigate organizations that flaunted environmental law and enforce fines on those they find in violation of the regulations.\nThough these suggestions would certainly make a difference for the environment, there are many who would balk at such an interventionist approach. Passing the bill with their amendments attached may prove even more difficult than if we had just tried to do it alone, and it may be better to quit while we're ahead and cut the Democrats back out of the discussions. Opening the door only to slam it back in their faces, however, might not be the best look for us."
 bobby.bipartisan.11.b:0 "It will be tough, but they're right. Make it stronger!"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.a:0 "Surely there is a middle ground here?"
 bobby.bipartisan.11.c:0 "This was a bad idea, reject the amendments."


 bobby.bipartisan.12.t:0 "An Avalanche of Calls"
 bobby.bipartisan.12.desc:0 "When President Kennedy opened the morning paper to find the draft of the Environmental Act staring back at him from page 3, he had cursed under his breath. Some careless staffer must have left a copy lying around for any old gumshoe journalist to find, and now the full draft of the bill was available for all to see. Already there was some consternation in the papers about the Democrats' amendments, and President Kennedy groaned at the knowledge that he had no doubt drawn the ire of some very powerful people.\nAt half past nine, the first phone call arrived, and they would seemingly never cease until well into the evening. Many different people could be heard on the other end, but they could have essentially been considered the same - all a bunch of lobbyists. Lobbyists for Mobil, Pacific Gas & Electric, Chevron, all manner of names that held so much clout in places that they really shouldn't. The calls were generally brief, but equally terse and all with the same message. 'Stop it.'\nThe demands of the lobbyists were simple. Dilute the terms of the bill and cease trying to cut into their profits. If the government refused, they vowed to use whatever resources were at their disposal to drown the NPP in bad press and flood the heartlands of the oil and energy industries with ads attacking the party. Heartlands like the Southwest and the Midwest, where the companies were essentially institutions in their own right who the working man looked to to provide his daily bread. Certainly, not men who would take kindly to their great corporate benefactors not being able to create as many jobs due to government meddling.\nBy sundown President Kennedy was no longer hiding his cursing. He knew he was in a bind, and was faced with a choice. If he continued down this path, he'd almost certainly lose some of the Midwestern states and quite possibly the next election. But was the defence of the natural world and the great green Earth that he and three billion people shared not more important than votes?\nWith one final expletive, he picked up the now silent phone and called the bill drafting committee, ready at last to inform them of his decision."

 bobby.bipartisan.13.t:0 "An Offer from the Right"
 bobby.bipartisan.13.desc:0 "As heated discussion over the strengthened Environmental Act continues, one might have expected the Far-Right sister faction to the Center NPP to be the angriest voice of them all. Yet discussions between the two broken halves have proven oddly civil. The Right is aware of President Kennedy's intentions and passes no ill judgement on his commitment to the environment. In fact, the most recent talks saw senior Far-Right leaders offer up the possibility of them supporting the bill through both branches of government. In return for concessions, of course.\nThe heartlands of the Right's voter base rely on industries that utilize un-green practices, and while tackling the pollution of the land we live in may be a moral imperative, it should not come at the cost of the average working man who put their faith in our party. So say the Far-Right, the clear solution is to press the regulations on a national scale, but allow certain exemptions at the state level so that more traditional industries can keep their overhead manageable. This, along with some other business-friendly amendments, would take the harsh bite out of the bill in the eyes of many businesses and business interests.\nWe need support to get our radical plan through, and perhaps allowing a few dissenters to cut themselves loose of the regulations is acceptable if most of the nation will still follow them. But it does leave a sour taste in the mouth..."

For shame, Mr President."\nLyndon B. Johnson's words today echo the frustrations heard within both factions of his party. Having brought the Democrats to the table, only to turn them away immediately upon the realization that their desires may be bad for the NPP, has been regarded as an insult and a betrayal not just to the Democrats, but to their Republican allies as well. Having previously agreed to cooperate with the R-Ds on matters such as these, so readily cutting them off may not have been the most stellar optics for us.\nJohnson and his allies in the halls of power have banded together in an alliance that threatens to tear apart the agreement between our two parties. They are demanding that we reopen negotiations and take the Democrats' views on board before they consider voting for the bill along with further input from the Republicans, and they are making it very clear that they will make things very, very difficult for us if we refuse.\nOur image in the eyes of the R-Ds does not look good right now, and yet if we acquiesce and are seen so willingly bowing before the demands of the opposition, the loss of voter confidence in us could be very damaging indeed. Today is a stressful day for President Kennedy."

With the only formality remaining being the signing of the bill into law by President Kennedy's own hand, a new dawn awaits this fair land of America. No more will selfish corporations be permitted to blindly squander the natural beauty of our country in the name of a quick profit, nor will the government itself turn a blind eye to the abuses against fair Mother Nature.\nNot only is this a great day for our natural splendour, but also a great day for everyone in the halls of power. Our close cooperation with the Republican-Democrats in getting this bill through proves just how much the government can achieve when it stops bickering amongst itself and instead finds common ground. Many with the R-D party ranks (and, perhaps more pertinently, within their electorate) have come to look upon us with ambivalence, if not outright favor, where before would have only been hostility.\nIn the future, we may well be able to count on their votes to back up our own. A few quiet polls and queries amongst Capitol Hill representatives has revealed that polls across the country have shifted as well."

 bobby.bipartisan.16.desc:0 "The first draft of the Environmental Act has arrived in Congress, and debate is already well underway. While it has been well received amongst certain members of the Center and the Republican-Democrats, others are less enthused. Some have called the bill "anti-business" and an attack on the values of the American free market, claiming that the extra costs it would cause to businesses would only lead to less jobs and a worse economy. The bill has spent the last few days under intense scrutiny from the subcommittees, and we remain far from a consensus.\nPrivately, representatives of our party's Far-Right faction have met with President Kennedy to discuss certain... adjustments to the bill that could potentially make it more palatable to them and their voters. These adjustments include granting exemptions from our proposed regulations to certain key businesses - primarily in NPP voting areas - while still "gently encouraging" more efficient practices overall. Not only would this quiet the criticisms of the more pro-business voices in Congress and help move the bill along, it would also shore up support for us amongst white collar voters who wish to see their companies prosper.\nOf course, taking the teeth out of the bill would render our whole endeavour somewhat pointless. Nonetheless, our ability to pass the bill as things stand is uncertain, and is a weak bill that passes not better than a strong bill that fails?"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.a:0 "What use is a law if nobody follows it?!"
 bobby.bipartisan.16.b:0 "They have a point. A few exemptions can't hurt."


 bobby.bipartisan.17.t:0 "The Republicans Lash Out"
 bobby.bipartisan.17.desc:0 ""A good bill, a great and necessary bill, made weak and toothless just to bow to the wishes of big business!"\nThis was the assessment of one Republican congressman today following our adjustment of the Environmental Act, and his words have been echoed by many other progressive Republicans on the floor. Safe to say, they are not happy with us acquiescing to the Far-Right's suggestions, and indeed many who formerly supported the bill now seem determined to vote against it in indignation.\nSome of the Republicans have demanded that we restore the original draft of the bill to be debated. While we have clearly lost a lot of support, going back now would perhaps place us in a worse position than to begin with, for not only will we have rankled the Republicans, but we will also have reneged on our word to our Far-Right colleagues. Still, perhaps their passion shows that the bill as it once stood had more of a chance than we thought."
 bobby.bipartisan.17.a:0 "God damn them, let's just dig up the original draft."

###### CRA EVENTS


 bobby.cra.1.t:0 "The Door Stands Ajar"
 bobby.cra.1.desc:0 "The time has finally come to discuss civil rights on a national level. Our new Civil Rights Act is not as comprehensive as it could be, yes, but it has almost guaranteed support from the more liberal Republicans, which more radical legislation might not have. Plus, we most likely can count on support from moderate Republicans if we treat them with a certain level of respect. When it comes to civil rights, we most certainly need every iota of support we can muster.\n\nWith this bill, we stand ready to help America live up to the dream of a free nation where all are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness! The only real roadblock is all of the so-called brilliant minds and wonderfully colorful personalities of Congress, especially from the "patriots" of the NPP-FR.\n\nWe owe it to Americans of all races, colors, and creeds to do our damned hardest to get this Act passed, and to create a nation where we can really finally say that everyone is created equal. We've certainly got our work cut out for us, but it's worthwhile work indeed."
 bobby.cra.1.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

 bobby.cra.2.t:0 "Slamming the Door"
 bobby.cra.2.desc:0 "We are done making compromises and half-promises. We are done living in a nation run by the few, working against the many. We are done putting up with racist, anti-American behavior. We are done accepting token excuses for lynchings and burnings. We are opening a new chapter of American history with this Civil Rights Act; the Act secures freedom and equality for every single American, no ifs, ands, or buts.\n\nWhile any moral, rational person could see this bill is the right thing to do, we have to deal with Congress here, so morality and rationality are essentially off the table. In fact, we've already gotten massive pushback from the NPP-FR. They're moaning about the usual- federal tyranny this, states' rights that. Absurd arguments of course, but we are going to have to find a way to counteract them. The Republicans have also begun to mumble about the perceived radicality of the Act, but we should be able to court some liberal (and perhaps moderate) Republican support if we play our cards right.\n\nIn any case, we have a long and difficult road ahead of us, but at the end of this road is a society better than the Founding Fathers could have even imagined all those years ago."
 bobby.cra.2.a:0 "Time to go to work."

 bobby.cra.3.t:0 "Into the Jaws of Democracy"
 bobby.cra.3.desc:0 "It's been long and grueling work to get to this point, but we can finally say with no small amount of pride that the Civil Rights Act has officially reached the Senate. It's a small victory, and we still have miles of  the winding halls of bureaucracy to guide our bill through, but it is a victory nonetheless.\n\nNo time to celebrate however, because our bill in now firmly in the gaping maw of American democatic republicanism. In order to debut on the Senate floor, the bill must pass the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is currently headed by one James Oliver Eastland, a bonafide, card-carrying, rabid segregationist. Under normal circumstances, we might just let him have his way and delay the bill in perpetuity so we don't rock the boat too much. However, these are not normal circumstances.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act must be made into law if these United States are to continue to call themselves the defenders of freedom, equality, and true democracy in the dark fever-dream of this world. As such, it is necessary that we get this bill past Eastland and onto the Senate floor. What option should we pursue?"
 bobby.cra.3.a:0 "Give LBJ a call..."
 bobby.cra.3.b:0 "Eastland can not be avoided... Send it to committee."

 bobby.cra.4.t:0 "The Phone Call"
 bobby.cra.4.desc:0 "Lyndon Bains Johnson. LBJ. Landslide Lyndon. Jumbo, in some circles. Love him or hate him, he just might be the most effective Senate whip in American history. He runs the damn Senate like his personal kingdom, and it might as well be. When LBJ dies, that man will just give Saint Peter "the Johnson Treatment" until they let him in. He might not be able to sell snow to an eskimo, but goddamn if that eskimo isn't gonna end up with a few pounds of snow one way or another.\n\nMore to the point however, he's an influential, powerful, experienced political figure, and he's sympathetic to the civil rights cause. He was the obvious choice to help the Civil Rights Act get through Eastland's Committee, and he's come up with a rather ingenious solution. According to a few archaic by-laws and regulations, we could just push this bill right past the Judiciary Committee and out to the Senate floor!\n\nLBJ's help is greatly appreciated, but at the same time, if we go for his plan and force the bill into a vote, we'll piss off the NPP-FR even more, and they may end up filibustering the bill. If they do filibuster, the Act is dead in the water, and who knows where we stand? Do we take a risk and hope they don't filibuster, or do we just pray Eastland lets the bill through?"
 bobby.cra.4.a:0 "Go with the Jonhson plan."
 bobby.cra.4.b:0 "The chance of a filibuster is already too high, we can't do this."

 bobby.cra.5.t:0 "The Act's Debut"
 bobby.cra.5.desc:0 "Johnson's plan went off without a hitch. Our little loophole is being tied up as we speak, but we shot the Civil Rights Act clear through the Judiciary Committee and right onto the Senate floor. Johnson just goes to show that there's still such a thing as a good Republican, one who's willing to work across party lines for what's best for the American people.\n\nUnfortunately, we were right about pissing off the NPP-FR. Eastland and Thurmond have been spending what seems like every waking moment complaining to the press. Funny how every single thing we do is a "tyrannic scandal, unseen since the time of Benedict Arnold"! In any case, we weren't counting on the NPP-FR vote.\n\nThe bill's on the floor, but it's not quite time for it go to vote. All we can do now is court a few more votes and pray that the NPP-FR doesn't filibuster."
 bobby.cra.5.a:0 "Fingers crossed, this is a new dawn for America!"

 bobby.cra.6.t:0 "The Chairman's Choice"
 bobby.cra.6.desc:0 "It was a tough choice sending the Civil Rights Act off to Eastland's Committee, but it may have been the right call in the end. He is, as to be expected, pulling out all the stops to prevent the bill from leaving Committee and tearing holes in the bill wherever he can, but he's taken a break from being a professional belligerent ape to make us an offer!\n\nEastland will actually let the bill through the Judiciary Committee if we adjust the bill a bit more to his liking! While we would obviously prefer that the bill stays complete, Eastland's alterations aren't as extreme as one might expect. They would weaken the Act certainly, but it would still be a major win for civil rights and a clear framework for future legislation. Plus, it would obviously get us out on the Senate floor.\n\nThat said, Eastland's alterations come with more downsides than just a weakened Act. A weaker Act means less Republican support, and the actual fight on the Senate floor will end up in rhetorical Battle-of-the-Somme style trench warfare, plus there's always a threat of a filibuster. Do we take Eastland up on his offer?"
 bobby.cra.6.a:0 "God damn him! Make the changes!"
 bobby.cra.6.b:0 "God damn him! We will not yield another inch!"

 bobby.cra.7.t:0 "The Filibuster"
 bobby.cra.7.desc:0 "Today has been a massive failure for the American civil rights movement. After all our work just getting the Civil Rights Act on the Senate floor, the NPP-FR and Dixiecrats alike, led by Strom Thurmond, have staged a massive, truly legendary filibuster. Strom's been going for 14 hours and he doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon! Hell, there's a rumor that they've got a trashcan in the Senate cloak room so he can piss without ever technically leaving the floor. It almost makes you wanna say that you admire his dedication, if it wasn't dedication to such a heinous cause.\n\nAnyway, more to the point, the Act might just be about dead in the water if we can't somehow scrape up 60 votes to override them. Though it pains me to say it, we may be forced to rework the Civil Rights act into a more palatable form. It seems like it's back to the drafting room. Again."
 bobby.cra.7.a:0 "Damn them!"

 bobby.cra.8.t:0 "The Magic Total"
 bobby.cra.8.desc:0 "We need to somehow get 60 votes to counteract Strom's little tirade against the Civil Rights Act. 60 may not sound like too much on the scale of national governments, but out of 100 Senators... well, we've got work to do. The clear and obvious place to start is with Senators who are right on the very edge. Give the right people a little nudge and we should (hopefully) have our 60 votes in no time. In theory.\n\nThe question then becomes who do we target? There's essentially two options that we have: do we go for the more moderate Dixiecrats, and tack on some federal support for their home states? Or do we scare the more moderate Republicans into supporting the Act by warning them this is the last real chance for an American Civil Rights Act? Either way, we just have to pray to God, Allah, Buddah, Vishnu, and George Washington that we can get this filibuster overturned and this bill passed."
 bobby.cra.8.a:0 "We've got a much better chance winning over the Republicans."
 bobby.cra.8.b:0 "If we can win over the Dixiecrats, this vote is a done deal."

 bobby.cra.9.t:0 "Negotiations with the Republicans"
 bobby.cra.9.desc:0 "We've recently met with several influential Republcian leaders over guaranteeing Republican support for the Civil Rights Act (and, more immediately, to counteract Strom's filibuster). The Republicans mostly support the concept of a Civil Rights Act, so negotiations went fairly smoothly.\n\nThat is, until LBJ, that damned crazy cowboy, downright demanded that we strengthen the Act if we want his support. Given the fact that he's Republican party whip, it might make sense to give into his demands. Plus, a stronger Civil Rights Act isn't really much of a bad thing, is it?\n\nThat said, while we might have greater Republican support if we acquiesce to LBJ, it could have unforeseen consequences towards NPP party stability and solidarity. It might be the better option to simply tell the Republicans that the current Civil Rights Act is the only option, even if we lose some support."
 bobby.cra.9.a:0 "It's time to strengthen the Act"
 bobby.cra.9.b:0 "We cannot risk the Party fracturing"

 bobby.cra.10.t:0 "Negotiations with the NPP-FR"
 bobby.cra.10.desc:0 "We've recently opened negotiations with the NPP-Fr over the Civil Rights Act. The FR are mostly against the Act right from the get go, so the negotiations were a bit touch-and-go right from the start. That said, they've sent out a list of demands that, if we incorporate, will mean we are all but guaranteed Congressional majority (assuming the Republicans play ball with this new bill).\n\nThe FR alterations are about as extreme as to be expected, and will totally defang, declaw, and tar and feather the Civil Rights Act. They do keep a few token tennents in the bill, but to be frank, this new Act would come nowhere near our original goals.\n\nWhile working with the FR would create a potentially more Congressionally popular Act, it would also complete gut the whole point of the Act. It may be wise to reject the FR demands and instead attempt to work with the Republicans."
 bobby.cra.10.a:0 "Let's just agree to work with the NPP-FR"
 bobby.cra.10.b:0 "We can't water it down any more, maybe the Republicans will be more amicable"

 bobby.cra.11.t:0 "A Welcome Surprise"
 bobby.cra.11.desc:0 "As soon as the Civil Rights Act hit the Senate floor, everyone tensed up for the obvious, inevitable filibuster, most likely from Thurmond and his ilk. The thing is, however, that filibuster never came! The Act is set to move into voting procedure very soon, and all without a hitch!\n\nThis is a big win, not just for us, but for the American people. We can focus on directly securing votes and generally preparing for the final vote on the Act without scrambling to react to some absurd, 24-hour long filibuster, and that means that we have a much better chance at passing the Civil Rights Act. We're therefore ever closer to reaching that perfect America enshrined in the Constitution-- a land where all are equal and free, judged by their conduct of action and content of ideas, not color of skin.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act is very far from a done deal, and we can't yet put our feet up and pat ourselves on the back. We can, however, breathe a sigh of relief that we have to jump one less hurtle on the road to a fair, free America."
 bobby.cra.11.a:0 " Looks like Strom knows when to shut up!"

 bobby.cra.12.t:0 "The Final Vote"
 bobby.cra.12.desc:0 "This vote on the Civil Rights Act has not been days, weeks or months in the making.\n\nIt has not been years, or even decades in the making. This Civil Rights Act has been generations coming. It's been coming since the first slave ship landed on the shores of Virgina.\n\nThis is a bill that has been sung on the plantations and in the "Colored Only" meeting halls. This is a bill that rode the Underground Railroad. This is a bill that fought and died at Gettysburg, waving the banner of the Union and of abolitionism. This is a bill that marched with Martin Luther King and his 250,000, demanding freedom and equality under American law.\n\nWe stand now on the precipice of a new era of American history. This new era will surely be one of true American patriotism-- a nation coming together to celebrate our commitment to freedom, equality, and brotherhood. Because are we not all Americans? Are we not all deserving of the same opportunities and rights?\n\nIf we pass this Act, we will have one thing that they will never have in Germania. We will have a nation united and working tirelessly toward a true, free democracy. And we promise you this: Democracy will always win in the end.\n\nNow, we just have to hope that the Senate agrees."

Earlier today, the United States Senate voted narrowly to pass the Civil Rights Act, and it is now sitting here, right on my desk, ready for me to sign. I wanted to take the time to explain to you what this new Act will do after I have signed it. This Act will secure a solid, equal chance for Americans, regardless of race, color, or creed.

All the hope we had for a better America, one truly by the people, of the people, and for the people has evaporated, as though it were a pleasant daydream of some fantasy world.\n\nWhat do we do now? What is there to do now? This was our dream, our goal, our destiny to claim. This was the last solid chance that civil rights are going to get in this country for the foreseeable future. And it was squandered. Where does one go from there?\n\nMartin Luther King Junior had a dream. That dream is dead. Malcom X promised freedom by either ballot or bullet. The ballot is failed.

He said that he would let the Civil Rights Act, in its unedited entirety, onto the Senate floor, since he believes that "Any Senator with half a brain will shut that bullshit down as soon as it goes to vote".\n\nIt's not entirely a so-called "good-faith" offer. Eastland expects that if he does this for us now (or if he "goes against every moral and logical fiber in my being for you un-American sissies"), we owe him some, unspecified favor ( the "very least you could do for making me break my own moral code").\n\nThe possibility of us owing Eastland a favor is honestly a terrifying one.

While MLK and Malcom X have certainly had (and continue to have) their differences (MLK emphasizes peaceful protests while Malcom X champions civil rights "by ballot or by bullet"), they certainly agree that civil rights is the most important issue that these United States face, and agree that a joint request to speak to RFK will have more weight and importance than two seperate requests.\n\nFrankly, they're right. Combined, they have the weight of most of America's black population behind them. That level of public support is hard to ignore. Plus, it's just the right thing to do to get the perspectives of actual civil rights leaders as we attempt to pass our own Civil Rights Act.\n\nOn the other hand, inviting them to the White House will certainly lead to an outcry from certain, choice elements in Congress.

After they exchanged a few terse pleasantries, Thurmond got down to the meat. "Listen, Bobby.

Get to the damn point."\n\nA touch of irritation scraping at his Southern faux-geniality, Thurmond continued, "We oughta smooth things over, is what I'm saying. I'm willing to finagle my boys in Congress into supporting your civil rights legislation, but there ain't no way they'll swallow it the way it is now. You want this thing to become law, Bobby? You want your legacy to be civil rights? You wanna get those negroes voting National Progressive for the next hundred years? I can make that happen, but only if you play ball and make a few changes to the bill. Tone down some of them more... forceful clauses. You do that? I'll get it through Congress. Now I'm done hanging like a fish on a hook. You can make a few compromises and we can be all buddy-buddy like the Rep-Dems, or I can bat every single one of your bills outta the Senate like I'm Babe Ruth. What's it gonna be?""

Suddenly, he slammed a manila folder onto the table. Refusing to give them the satisfaction of a flinch, Kennedy leaned forward to read the title. He wasn't surprised to see it was the latest draft of his nascent civil rights bill.\n\nTurning his head to exhale, Wallace drawled, "Senator Thurmond and I have been reading this over. Now, Bobby, don't you reckon it's a little soon to be pushing all'a this? Now I don't know about them fancy boys up in Massachusetts, but the good people of Alabama ain't too fond of sudden change, especially when it's goin' against the overwhelmin' view of the state."\n\n"Well, gentlemen," began Kennedy, not getting any further before being cut off by Thurmond. "Now, now, Bobby," said Thurmond, as though he were talking to a disobedient child, "we ain't done speakin' yet. Now, George and I have been in Washington for a good deal longer than yourself, and ol' Jack, god rest his soul." Was that the slightest of smiles on Wallace's lips? Kennedy felt his jaw clench. How dare they drag Jack into this!\n\nTaking a drag, Thurmond continued, "Sometimes, you gotta give a little, if you want your friends to stay friends. Loosen the ol' belt, so to speak. Now, why don't George and I make a few revisions to this here draft, send it through in the morning?" He bared his nicotine-stained teeth to Kennedy, a smile utterly without mirth."

"Well, Senator, they are my party brothers. I thought it was understood that I'd try to work things out within the party before we approached you. Understand how this must look for me; we don't want Southern voters to see us crossing the floor and wonder why they voted National Progressive."\n\n"Instead of votin' Rep-Dem?

It also doesn't hurt that he has dirt on every Republican who's ever so much as breathed in the Capitol Building during his time as Senate majority leader.\n\nOf course, this detente with the Republicans has not come without its price. Johnson has made it abundantly clear that he will tolerate no further deviation from the tenets of our partnership, which means an end to co-operation with our right-wing party brothers, or, at the very least, an end to co-operation that Johnson knows about. Nevertheless, our relationship with our erstwhile allies has become shakier than ever, and it's unclear how long it'll last, or what Thurmond and Wallace will do when they find out about it.\n\nEnjoying a glass of scotch in the solitude of the Oval Office, President Kennedy hopes to God he can keep all those juggling balls in the air until his civil rights bill gets through Congress."

Rumour from the Capitol has it that the usually genial Carolinian flew into an incandescent rage when he was informed, shouting himself hoarse.\n\nWe're in the mud now. Thurmond has instructed all the members of the party's right-wing faction in Congress to boycott our legislation, voting absent on all of our bills. Not only that, but him and most of his lackeys are refusing to take calls from the White House. It's not likely he can keep this up forever, unless he wants to go down in the public's eye as an obstructionist dinosaur hellbent on fracturing the party for a petty personal grievance, but he can certainly keep his tantrum going until civil rights comes up for voting.\n\nAll we can do now is pray that we made the right choice and that our alliance with the Republicans will get us through this.

Exhaling, Kennedy slowly descended from the clouds into the Oval Office. Back to reality, with its harsh lights and painful compromises.\n\nKennedy felt his knees pop as he stood, followed closely by the crack of his spine as he gave it a much-needed stretch. In a minute he'd call for his secretary to bring the draft to the typing pool so they could clean it up and copy it, but for now he was simply happy to enjoy the quiet solitude of the Oval Office at twilight, where nobody was trying to take something from him.\n\nAt the realisation that it was, in fact, twilight, the President did a double take, striding to the windows. The sky had that rich saltwater taffy colour it only got for a few minutes as the sun sank below the horizon. Had he really sat there tapping away for six hours?\n\nWell, now came the hard part: getting it through Congress. No matter the terms, there would always be bastards in power who wanted nothing more than to spend their lives trying to keep black people down. Well, he thought as he sat back down, fuck 'em.

Nevertheless, despite his reservations, Kennedy had decided to try and compromise with Thurmond, get his boys to vote for civil rights, even if the bill had to be redrafted to be less ambitious than he had hoped. Changes could be made, as the years flew by. It wasn't a betrayal.\n\nAt least, that's what he told himself. As soon as Kennedy had taken the bait, Thurmond had reeled him in, making more and more outrageous demands, refusing to negotiate in good faith. "...and another thing, Mr. President, I reckon we oughta allow private schools to choose their own students. Shit, it ain't up to the government to force privately-owned, god-fearing institutions to take Negroes against their will."\n\nPresident Kennedy massaged his forehead between thumb and forefinger, receiver pressed to his ear. He could tell that Thurmond was trying to strongarm him. With every concession he was promised he only got more bold. It was fairly obvious that he was trying to whittle away as much of the bill as he could. Kennedy would have to let him have a few wins, but Thurmond seemed determined to gut it. It wouldn't surprise him if the Senator had a copy of the bill and a pair of scissors in front of him right now.\n\nPresident Kennedy took a deep breath while Thurmond continued to rattle off changes he wanted made. The bill getting toned down in exchange for the reactionaries' aid getting it through Congress was a given, but could he allow them to rip the heart out of it? To castrate the dream he had spent so long working towards?"

The National Progressive Party was like a creche full of squabbling toddlers, and he the teacher put in the unenviable position of forcing them to behave. Whose idea was it to form a party of segregationists and progressives, anyway? He supposed he could blame the bastard Thurmond and Henry Wallace for that one.\n\nStill, they could work together, from time to time. He wondered if it was worth the necessary compromises. The civil rights bill would get through Congress and pass into law, but had the cost been worth it? In the end, he'd stood strong, refusing to compromise on the central points, but Thurmond had still wrung some drastic changes out of him like dirty water from a dishcloth.\n\nBut that was the nature of compromise. Nobody got what they wanted and everyone ended up unhappy. Slumped in his chair, the President wondered if he should have worked harder to get Johnson and the Republicans on his side, rather than trying to co-operate with his party brothers. It would certainly have led to stronger civil rights legislation.\n\nWell, what was done was done. There was no use castigating himself for what he couldn't change. All he could do now was push the amended bill through Congress and hope that more progressive senators would be elected in the future."

His face was burning with humiliation. Here he was, the goddamn President, and a Senator of his own party was having more of an impact on the bill than he was. And Thurmond didn't even want it in the first place. He'd basically castrated it, tearing out everything that made it righteous, leaving only token changes, minor reforms, ineffectual promises, and plenty of loopholes for Southern governors to exploit to their hearts' content. It was a massacre.\n\nAnd there was nothing he could do. The President wanted to vomit right there on the Resolute desk, disgusted at his own weakness. He'd tried to negotiate in good faith with Thurmond's reactionaries and this was the price he'd had to pay. It was better than nothing, but not much better. He'd gone into this trying to achieve the dream of equality for every American, and that dream had been sacrificed on the bloody altar of realpolitik.\n\nThe President sighed, holding his head in his hands. Millions of African-Americans looked up to him to save them, to pull them into the light, and he'd as good as betrayed them.\n\nWhen that bill passed Congress, they'd see just how wrong they had been to put their trust in him."

Speaking from a Baltimore publicity event this morning, President Kennedy said "Americans elected the NPP to root out the injustices of this great nation of ours, and I will not turn a blind eye to the crimes of those cancerous individuals eating away at our own party. Rest assured that those responsible for this travesty will be found and made to answer for their actions, and those groups within the party that seek to contravene our goals will be cast down".

And now he was being attacked by the men closest to him, the men who were supposed to be his allies.\n\nHumphrey had been repeatedly voicing his concerns with the use of the FBI to silence the enemies of progress, and although he was of little concern, he was getting louder. Harder to ignore was Ramsey Clark, the man Kennedy himself had raised from obscurity to the lofty position of Attorney General. Both of them objected to the ongoing COINTELPRO program, foolishly claiming it was totally unethical and eroded the essential freedoms of all Americans. Neither of them could be trusted. Was everyone on his side turning from the cause of justice?\n\nWas it Robespierre who said you couldn't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs? Did they think their ideals could be realized without getting their hands dirty? The President's hand tightened around the glass. For the greater good, Clark needed to be silenced. Something had to be done."

For Christ's sake, he's ten years younger than Clark and they don't even look alike!\n\nNow he's lying in a hospital bed and threatening to sue. He saw their faces, so we'll have to give him a big payout to shut him up and keep this out of the papers. We probably shouldn't try that again, but we've got to silence Clark as soon as possible.

As Humphrey screeched about "dirty tricks" and "due process", Kennedy rubbed his aching forehead. It felt like he had a diadem around his head which kept tightening with every furious remonstrance.\n\nApparently, one of Hoover's latest incompetents had gone to Humphrey instead of Kennedy to consult him about the plan to slander Clark with an outrageous scandal and Humphrey, irritatingly ethical bastard that he is, immediately disavowed the plan and called the White House to yell about it. The President seems to have been able to convince Humphrey that it was Hoover's idea and he hadn't heard about it yet, but he knows he's on seriously thin ice. One more fuck-up and we're in serious strife.\n\nFinally able to end the one-sided tirade, Kennedy hung up. Leaning back in his chair, he wondered how long it would be until Humphrey connected the dots between this and his use of the FBI to silence the reactionaries in the party. Kennedy yelled for his secretary to bring him an aspirin and dialled Hoover's number, intent to fix this crisis and shut Clark up before this gets worse than it already is.\n\nKennedy listened to the dial tone.

Always the same time, always the same room.\n\nAlthough we haven't actually caught him doing anything yet, it certainly looks unseemly. Even with no actual evidence, people could easily draw their own conclusions if the photos of Clark entering that motel were to be anonymously sent to the Washington Post.

His legacy would remain untarnished by the occasionally pragmatic things he had to do to secure it, and he was now free to continue his crusade against injustice. So what if he had to circumvent the strict lay of the law a few times? That was hardly criminal. All's fair in love and war, after all, and if the rightists were determined to stand in the path of progress then they deserved to get cast down.\n\nYes, he thought, feeling the strange, powerful lightness of triumph rising in his chest.

When one of our agents confronted Clark at his office with our knowledge of his habitual motel visits, he immediately became furious and threatened to call the police if he didn't leave.\n\nAll our attempts to silence Clark have been total failures and we're in serious strife. If we don't do something drastic within the next few days, it's a certainty that Clark will leak our crimes (and Kennedy now couldn't think of them as anything other than crimes) to the press.\n\nKennedy felt his gorge rising just thinking about it.

 bobby.justice.3.t:0 "Sins of the Father"
 bobby.justice.3.desc:0 "Exposed to the foibles of Washington from a young age, Robert Kennedy came to realise early in life that America is a land of contradictions. Many of his father's fellow senators professed to value freedom and liberty above all, while simultaneously denying the fundamental rights of a great many of their own citizens for no reason other than the colour of their skin. The Civil Rights Act is a step in the right direction to right the wrongs of his forebears, but compared to the many injustices plaguing America, it seems but a drop in a vast, vast basin.\n\nSitting in the Oval Office, nursing a tumbler of scotch, the President wonders why he doesn't feel any sense of accomplishment. He'd changed the lives of millions, and yet it felt like he'd hardly done anything at all. So many terrible things were still happening across America. School segregation, redlining, FBI harassment, it seemed like the list kept going on and on, an unassailable mountain of obstacles.\n\nKennedy felt resoluteness rising in him, buoying him up even as he felt like sinking. He was the President now, and he had power, the power to do what was right. I can't rest, he thought, as he downed the scotch, until I get it all done.\n\nEven if it kills me."

No matter the cost, all traces of reactionary dissent must be purged from the government so that nothing and no one stands in the way of justice for all Americans."

 bobby.justice.5.desc:0 "Nobody said reforming the nation would be easy, but it'd be a whole lot less painful if our own employees weren't actively scheming against us. Using the FBI as his own personal army of spies, Hoover has become one of the most powerful and feared men in the country, covertly infiltrating government organizations all across America, allegedly amassing a huge quantity of blackmail material, and carrying out clandestine and often illegal operations. In essence, they're a shadow government within the government, infesting our institutions like dormant tuberculosis bacteria, just waiting for the conditions to be right for them to awaken.\n\nThis has to stop. Though he should be our obedient underling, Hoover has effectively become a rogue spymaster with an unprecedented level of power and clout, and his interests are very often at odds with our own. He's far too entrenched in the FBI to be effectively neutralized, but perhaps we can give him a bit of his own medicine to get a leash on him and stop his unethical operations.\n\nThere have been unseemly rumours about Hoover and his long-time protege Clyde Tolson floating around for decades, involving all-male parties and furtive visits from handsome young men in the middle of the night. Hoover may like dirty tricks, but two can play at that game. Let's fling his closet open and see what skeletons fall out."

Even more interestingly, we got some pictures of Hoover and Tolson meeting with a pair of handsome young men in the hotel bar and taking them up to their room.\n\nAll you have to do is a little bit of digging and all of a sudden you're turning up yellowed old skeletons all over the place.

From the records that remain it appears that Hoover has been using the FBI as his own personal army, sending agents to acquire blackmail material on important figures and extrajudicially pursuing suspected criminals.\n\nAmong the less shocking stuff, in a number of redacted files, our agents have uncovered evidence of a secret program called COINTELPRO. We don't have all the facts so far, but it appears to be an intelligence gathering program focused on somewhat vaguely-chosen "enemies of the nation", most notable civil rights leaders. Hoover apparently authorized the use of illegal tactics to gather information on these people and to harass them into silence and inaction.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a complete and total violation of the victims' rights and is a subversion of everything President Kennedy stands for.

Kennedy's chair creaked back as he looked at each of them in turn- Hoover, Humphrey, key members of his cabinet. He turned to the aides clustered around the wall and asked them to leave. When he was alone with his most trusted underlings- as well as Hoover- he began.\n\n"Mr. Hoover, so far we've discussed the principles and functions of the COINTELPRO program. And for now I'm letting you off the hook." The President had hoped Hoover would visibly show relief, but he just sat there blankly like an Olmec head. "However, it strikes me that it would be a colossal waste of resources to simply cancel the program."\n\nThat got some odd looks from Humphrey and the others. Hoover narrowed his eyes in appraisal. Kennedy continued, "It has occurred to me that with minimal difficulty this program could be repurposed to... investigate... certain reactionary elements that oppose the goals and ideals of this administration. Including the enemies of justice within the party."\n\nEveryone in the room looked taken aback. Humphrey stared at the President open-mouthed in surprise, internally furious Kennedy hadn't consulted him beforehand. Hoover, after a moment of inaction, smiled knowingly. "Of course, Mr. President. Why, it would hardly take any time at all. All you've got to do is write me a list." His toadlike grin stretched out his every wrinkle.\n\nKennedy nodded blankly. "Very good, Mr. Hoover.

Kennedy tracked him with narrowed eyes.\n\n"It seems you've made some decisions I wasn't consulted on," began Humphrey acerbically, tossing Kennedy a sidelong glance.\n\n"I am not beholden to you, Hubert," replied the President dryly, holding himself tall. "Not every ruler feels the need to consult their vizier before every little decision."\n\nHumphrey stopped stock still and spun to Kennedy. "Good God, man! Can you hear yourself? You're speaking like a Roman Emperor, a petty Caesar!" His face was becoming ruddy. "You want to use Hoover's goons to investigate our own party? It's vile! I won't condone it! The purpose of curtailing injustice is lost when you achieve it through the methods of a tyrant!"\n\nKennedy remained coolly detached through Humphrey's tirade. He took a sharp breath. "Hubert, would St. George have tried to slay the dragon without a sword? We can't stay on the high road when our enemies prove that they are willing, again and again, to stoop to the dirtiest tactics available to them. A weapon is just a weapon, it is neither good nor evil, only a tool for the man who wields it to impose his will on the world. We will use the FBI to purge the enemies of justice from America. That's all there is to it." And with that closing remark, he turned on his heel, opened the door, and strode purposefully from the room.\n\nHumphrey's shoulders slumped.

This epidemic of racist violence against American citizens by the men who are being paid to protect them must be stopped.\n\nThis morning, President Kennedy gave a speech at the Capitol virulently denouncing the systemic racism of law enforcement, and promising to root out the un-American racists entrenched within the nation's police.

"Do you two," began Kennedy, barely keeping his rage in check, "know who you're talking to? I'm the goddamn President! I have no choice, this has to be done if we want to keep Thurmond and Eastland's minions in check. When the President does it, that means it's not illegal. Believe me, this is the right thing to do, the only thing to do! This is how we save the nation!" He raised his arms above him and stared up at the immaculately whitewashed ceiling.\n\nLater, when he was seething alone in the Oval Office, Kennedy found his thoughts circling invariably back to Clark and Humphrey.

It's like they've already forgotten about Nixon.\n\nWe have everyone in Washington, literally everyone, going for our throat. Our friends have distanced themselves and even our staunchest allies won't return our calls. Thurmond's coterie have been screaming themselves hoarse all day and, most worryingly, the President has already received numerous death threats. The Kennedy Administration teeters on the edge of annihilation as discussion of impeachment begins behind closed doors.\n\nIn the Oval Office, the President sits slumped in his chair.

Kennedy sighed, looking around at the room that had once played host to both his father and his brother. How would he be remembered now? As a stalwart of civil rights, an enemy of injustice and a champion of progress, or as a cowardly, corrupt slimeball who used his power to contravene the Constitution and to send an army of spies against his political adversaries?\n\nKennedy clenched his hands into fists and sat up. No, he couldn't let himself fall into despair. For God's sake, he was the President! I have to move forward, he thought, as he picked up the phone. This can't be the end.

Now Clark was out of the picture, there was nobody to stop the expansion of COINTELPRO and his campaign to end injustice could continue unimpeded. After all, a weapon is just a weapon. In the hands of a good man, it is an instrument of good. Now nobody would ever know he had done it, and his legacy as an icon of progressivism was ensured.

Restricting redlining will be very unpopular with business owners and bankers, as well as the wider white population in general, but the unpopularity of our policies has never stopped us from trying to do the right thing before.\n\nTo deal with redlining, we could either do what's right and go hard on banning the practice , erasing every loophole, or we could try and preserve some of our political capital and put some small but meaningful restrictions into place instead.

This morning, one such incident arising from integration pushback appeared on the front page of President Kennedy's newspaper, making him cringe from something other than his morning grapefruit.\n\nApparently, a pair of black teenagers whose family has recently moved into a previously redlined suburb in Atlanta attempted to order lunch at the local greasy spoon diner and the owner, one Lester Maddox, refused to serve them and asked them to leave. Despite this obviously being illegal since the passing of the Civil Rights Act, Maddox's supposed right to choose his customers has become Dixie's cause du jour, and Maddox has already appeared on several right-leaning Southern radio stations bemoaning the sudden change in his community's demographic makeup.\n\nWe have to respond to this quickly before it spirals out of control, to make it publicly known that the regressive racism of Maddox and his ilk has no place in modern America.

In this modern age, African-Americans still lack many of the resources and opportunities provided to their white brothers. This should not be so. This great nation was founded by men of many backgrounds and cultures, who came together to create a common bond between them all, to create a nation in which all would have the same rights and privileges and could enjoy freedom and liberty without impediment. America was founded on the principle that all of its citizens would be free and equal, and the freedom of all of our citizens is diminished when not all Americans are equal. Are we to say that this is the land of the free for all but those with black skin? From now on, when some of the less enlightened say that black children should be excluded from white schools, we will respond with a resounding 'No'. In our ongoing fight against injustice, we will promote the integration of schools across America, so that all of our nation's children are privy to the same essential rights and opportunities."\n\nThe press pounced on that like hyenas on an injured gazelle, knowing full well that discussion of integration would stoke the flames of controversy.

Leroy could hardly believe his eyes as he was shown the vast collection of equipment his new school had for experiments. His teacher taught the class the basic principles of chemistry by showing them how to make 'elephant toothpaste'. Leroy oohed and aahed alongside his new classmates as the black goop shot out of the tube.\n\n12:30: English Literature. Every student was handed a copy of Huckleberry Finn, which Leroy was surprised to learn was his to keep. At his old school they never had enough books for everyone. The students took turns to read it aloud, and he felt everyone's eyes on him when the boy next to him suddenly stopped as he came to the word "nigger". For a moment the boy seemed to be at a loss for words, then he skipped it over, and the tension abated. It made Leroy feel awkward.\n\n4:30: Hometime. Leroy said goodbye to the trio of boys he'd befriended at recess and made his way outside, trying to ignore the eyes of some of the other students and their parents boring through him like a drill. He'd known from the beginning that being the school's first black kid wasn't going to be easy, but he was sure he'd be able to win them over in time. As he walked home, he resolved to push himself harder at school than ever before.

Despite their pretensions at self-determination, states are still heavily dependent on federal funding to stay afloat, particularly poorer Southern states.

He's trotting out the usual arguments of states' rights, calling us undemocratic for imposing new law and order standards federally rather than leaving it up to the states. \n\nTo one experienced in politics, Goldwater is clearly trying to position himself as a tough "law and order" politician to the public, most likely a preamble to a Presidential run in '68. Goldwater as President, there's a sobering thought. Thankfully, for the time being at least, he's powerless to prevent the cause of justice and our bill sailed through Congress, making our prison reforms law. Thousands of unjustly treated convicts will now experience a greater quality of life and have access to the same rights as every other American, no thanks to Goldwater."

A crucial battleground in every election, the pendulum of the Midwest can make or break Presidents, their allegiance aligning from candidate to candidate like the swinging of a metronome. \n\nUnfortunately, it appears as though the favours of the Midwest have swung thoroughly in Goldwater's direction. Over the last few weeks, he's been touring around the Midwest giving speeches at town halls against the President, a particular focus being our recent prison reform bill, which Goldwater has presented to his malleable audiences as being weak on crime and perilous to the idyllic existence they hold dear. \n\nGoldwater's managed to stoke the reliably gullible Midwesterners into a fury. Protests have been held against our reforms in almost every major city in the region as Midwestern sentiment towards the President turns sour.

On the radio they were saying there'd been riots in Detroit and Des Moines, whites intimidating black students and breaking the windows of black-owned businesses. \n\nIt seemed like the President was trying to make things better for them, but with everything he did that should have been good had the opposite result.

Their wives and daughters weep on television screens all over America.\n\nThe South is ready to explode, and the rest of the country isn't much better. People are in an uproar over what they see as the government murdering people who were protesting against their breaking the First Amendment.

 bobby.9.desc:0 "John F. Kennedy was a major politician and the leader of the Democratic Party's fledgling social progressive circles. Throughout his life and career, he earnestly advocated for these forward-looking ideas during his time in Congress. A champion of the growing civil rights movement in the United States, he rallied young voters to the cause of political equality as well as the need for a government that actively provides for the welfare of its citizens. Shortly after Nixon's resignation, he ascended to the presidency but was shot weeks later.\n\nHis brother, Robert F. Kennedy, has now ascended to the presidency and plans to continue his father's legacy where he left off. In his various appearances before the public, he has made it clear that he will govern with the same ideals and principles espoused by his brother. The struggle for civil rights and the fate of segregation, a topic about which John F. Kennedy was especially vocal, defines a large part of his campaign. Robert Kennedy has heralded the proposed Civil Rights Act as one of the cornerstones of his campaign, vowing to pass the bill during his term.\n\nAlso important is Kennedy's economic policy, also largely inspired by his father. Under his leadership, he claims, the federal government will actively work to combat poverty through welfare programs, state grants, and other initiatives. It seems his brother's socially progressive agenda will ring true in all of his actions as president."

They quickly got confirmed what they long had believed, that the other person was of the worst character imaginable, rude, brash and too highly thinking about himself. The meeting was planned and arranged for by one of the Republican party leaders, and worst of all, there were going to be more of these meetings.\n\nWhen the President came back to the White House he said:\n"He has some, actually, only a few, good ideas, but what an awful man, the less I see him, the better."\nDespite the harsh comments, the meeting was actually somewhat constructive and they managed to work out some ideas, and a note about it was circulated in the party.

Without the reactionary bigwigs in the party, President Kennedy knew he had little hope of wrangling Congress or getting his legislation through. It often seemed strange that he had to draft a civil rights bill alongside people who were so staunchly against the cause of justice, but American politics hadn't been the same since the war. In his quiet moments, he often found himself wondering what Jack would have done. What his father would have done. Would they have worked with people like this, to try and better America? Was it worth whatever price he'd end up having to pay?\n\nPutting on his brave face, President Kennedy held individual meetings with each of the reactionaries' strongmen (and woman) to hear their thoughts on the bill. Careful not to make any promises or acquiesce to any of their demands (pardon, 'suggestions'), the President assured them that he valued the party's unity above all, and that he would not go ahead with civil rights legislation without the full support of the party.\n\nPrivately, he knew it would cost him. But what? What compromises would he have to make to bring equality to every American? And after all had been said and done, would it be worth it, in the end?"

Which has priority above all. Burke has time and again emphasized how he is in the cabinet only to maintain security interests and make sure that government policy will comprimise more important strategical goals, and during the war in South Africa he was in charge of the Congo landings that effectively broke the stalemate and guaranteed OFN victory. Minister of interior 'Scoop' Jackson overheard the conversation and intervened to object any replacement of Burke, Burke would not have been able to convince the other top officers to go through with the Congo plan unless he knew he had the President's support, having such a qualified military man on top of our government is a benefit, argued Scoop.\n\nClaude Pepper, former nominee for vice president has been suggested as a possible name, he has long been a member of the Party and knows his ins and outs of the Dixiecrats, having stood on the ballot with now, Speaker of the House, Strom Thurmond in 1960.

The passage of the Civil Rights Act is an extraordinary step forward for all of us but, today, our struggles are not over. While the equality we strive for has now been codified, we must maintain our commitment to the downtrodden across America and refuse to withdraw into complacency. Unfortunately, we must still come to terms with the root of the issue.\n\nAcross the country, the remnants of prejudice continue to fester, many unabated by the legislation we have passed. While the blatant and ugly efforts of states to segregate the races of America have been dashed, the echoes from earlier times have nonetheless persisted. To many, these institutions are a fact of life, for good or ill, but our nation was not founded on the principles espoused by America's founders. I call on all citizens of the United States to look at ourselves and our society critically, and question some of the things we take for granted. The un-American attitudes of racist groups have lost their stranglehold on politics, but that does not mean they have been vanquished for good.\n\nConfronting these uncomfortable aspects will not be comfortable or enjoyable, but it is something we must do as a nation if we ever plan to move forward.

After a brief photo op in the Oval Office, Dr. King, the President and their wives had met for a private dinner away from the cameras, to strengthen their relationship in the eyes of the public and discuss the cause for civil rights.\n\nKennedy liked Dr. King, and wondered if, in another life, free from the shackles of politics, they might have been friends. In this life, however, they both had responsibilities pulling them apart, King's to his community and Kennedy's to the welfare of the nation. Nevertheless, they agreed on the absolute necessity for racial justice and that the right to equality is deserved by all Americans. King was no radical; he understood realpolitik and knew that Rome wasn't built in a day, but the President could still see the yearning for a better future behind King's eyes.

After a youth spent as a petty criminal, Malcolm X had found religion in prison with the Nation of Islam, quickly becoming the organization's public face and a major spokesperson for racial justice. Though differing from many other black leaders due to his racial separatist ideals, Malcolm X has over time become one of the most prominent and outspoken figures fighting for racial equality.\n\nNot to mention the most controversial, no matter which side of the debate you're on. As he sipped his coffee (wine, of course, would be haram), listening to Ethel and Malcolm's wife Betty exchanging stilted small talk at the other end of the table, Kennedy wondered if meeting with Malcolm X had been such a good idea. Malcolm X seemed skeptical, and frankly, Kennedy couldn't blame him. After hundreds of years of getting sidelined by white politicians, why should Malcolm X trust him? Kennedy wished he could somehow show the man what lay in his heart, his genuine commitment to justice, to racial equality, to bettering the lives of African-Americans.\n\nIn the end, both men left feeling frustrated.

Chicago, in short, is the embodiment of the American dream. Growing up in New England, from time to time you would hear the term 'Yankee Ingenuity' get thrown around.

Standing here in Chicago, all I can see is Yankee Ingenuity."\n\n"However, there is a poison to all hard work. Some would see workers given nothing if it meant that their own pockets might get a little deeper. Workers of all kinds, deserve rights. They deserve the right to unionize.

To all those affected by racism, I say that your fight is not forgotten. Civil Rights is not limited just to the African American communities-- it extends to all peoples, of all colors, who have been discriminated against by our twisted system.

I stand here, in one of the most peaceful, beautiful places our great nation has to offer, to say that no matter how divided we may seem, we are still an indivisible union, connected through soulful bonds that may never be torn apart. Every year, millions of people visit this place. As such, it remains, and forever shall remain one of the great bonds that tie our union together. We are a nation of one people, one heritage. Regardless of race or creed or color, we are not simply Americans, we are America itself."\n\n"Standing in such a place as this, we may be reminded of the words of our forebear John Winthrop to his shipmates aboard the Arabella, as they were traveling to the New World, for a new life. 'We must always remember,' he said, 'that we shall be as a city upon a hill-- the eyes of all people are upon us.' Today, as always, the eyes of all people remain upon us, anxiously studying the American Experiment. Be it through our politics or our culture or our faiths, in all levels of government we must be constructed of men and women of resolute strength, aware of the trust placed in them by God and the freedom-loving peoples of the world. Our endeavors, as with the men of the Arabella's endeavors, will not be judged upon the basis of the color of our skin, nor the nature of our God, nor the ideology to which we owe allegiance; rather, we will be judged by the world be build for future generations, be it terrible, or righteous."\n\nAn hour or so later, once the reporters had asked their questions and the few tourists and shaken the President's hand, Bobby Kennedy returned to the Lincoln Continental he had been driven to Yellowstone in. He turned to Hubert Humphrey, who sat beside him. "That took a bit longer than expected. I've decided we're going to Washington next.

I'm not sure how poorly it could've gone in the first place, considering how well we poll here, but every single talking point hit the nail on the head. The people out there loved every minute of the speech."\n\n"Sure," replied Humphrey, "I think what we all said out there should help us a bit here in Washington. At least prevent us from losing the state as a whole. So, what's next after we finish this nice little dinner?"\n\n"We've got the rest of the West Coast to cover. I was thinking...""

These people lived right on the doorstep of the Japanese ports on the Pacific Ocean, and were obviously eagerly anticipating some anti-Japanese rhetoric. Bobby Kennedy shuffled his papers on the podium and began to speak.\n\n"People of Portland, I see among you many expectant faces. Of course, the West Coast has faced the greatest and most troubling humiliation and anger from the Japanese Treaty Ports brought about by the now-void Akagi Accords. Many of your industrial sectors are also under duress, and with such difficult times upon us recently, it is no wonder that the main line of American politicians have failed you in leadership. I can promise you that with the National Progressive Party at your side, the City of Portland, the State of Oregon, and the entirety of the West Coast will be brought out of these difficult times unsullied by pain or scarred by poverty."\n\nKennedy continued with and without his speech notes, simply giving a run-of-the-mill speech to please the overall masses. These past few weeks must have been hell on his writers, and the most recent ones really needed a little spicing up. In any case, the people seemed to love it, as they always had.\n\nAfter another hour or so of on-and-off speaking in Mount Tabor, Bobby once again hopped back in the black Lincoln Continental of the Presidential Motorcade with Vice President Humphrey alongside him. "Well," began Humphrey, "we couldn't go along the West Coast without hitting California, now could we?"\n\n"No, we couldn't, Hugh," replied Kennedy, "I've got two drafts for a speech in San Francisco.

Some said Houston, for its great population; some recommended San Antonio, for a trip to the Alamo; some called for Austin, for its place as the state capital. Bobby himself eventually had to intervene, deciding to visit Austin. On the steps of the Texas Capitol, thousands of people- of all races- looked on. Beside Kennedy stood Lyndon Baines Johnson, the famous Texan politician, and former opponent of RFK's presidential run.\n\n"People of Austin, before I begin, I want to thank all of you for the warm welcome I have received, not only from your city but also your leaders. I of course speak of the man beside me, Lyndon Johnson, one whom I greatly respect. In divided times, such as we find ourselves in presently, it is easy to see only the name of the party, and not the name of the man who follows it. It is easy to dismiss someone as 'other' because of the party line. However, I say that a man is loyal to his own convictions, and, as such, should not be judged upon the party with which he sides. I see the actions and policies of your Congressman Lyndon Johnson and I am moved and inspired by them. He has fought for the torch of Civil Rights as much as any Progressive, so why should I not call him friend?"\n\n"The actions of Lyndon Johnson reflect the whole of the State of Texas, and they will not go unnoticed, nor unappreciated. The only way that we can achieve true equality in this great nation is through the spirit of unity that ties all Americans together. Only through unity, may we achieve equality. So, together, I believe that the Republican-Democrats and the Progressives may yet carry the torch of Civil Rights not individually, but together."\n\nBobby continued to give short speeches intermittently with Lyndon Johnson, as well as the Governor of Texas John Connally, for more than an hour. When the whole affair had finished and all attendees had shaken hands for unity or somesuch, Robert's throat was dry and sore, and his hand ached from the crushing grip of LBJ. He hopped back into the jet black Continental with Vice President Hubert Humphrey. "Next stop: Alabama," he said.\n\n"Wallace is gonna give you shit, that's a given," said Humphrey, "we could rub it in his face.""

It had everything: a full bathroom, bigger than some inner-city apartments; a king-size feather bed; radio; mini-fridge; even a TV! Unfortunately, the TV only had a few channels, so Bobby chose the news as background noise while he read about the latest developments in Europe. Regardless, after a long day of giving fiery speeches in Montgomery, Alabama, it was nice to relax for a few minutes. \n\nIt was quite the miracle he had the television turned up at all, as he heard his name said. Intrigued, Bobby increased the volume. "...overnor Wallace claimed President Robert F. Kennedy came to Alabama this week only to slander him and the entire state of Alabama. Wallace said that he had served the state of Alabama faithfully for many years and would not let a 'Yankee upstart with no political experience' tell him or his constituents how to live or run themselves. He also said 'Kennedy is trying to break the unity of the NPP and the State of Alabama'."\n\nBobby turned off the TV, his lips curling into a frown. He expected and hoped for an outcome like this. This was just the opportunity to kick Wallace down a couple of notches. If Wallace wanted to play ball, he'd soon learn a simple truth."

The Montgomery hotel had been pleasant, but with George Wallace's comments, it was time to leave. With fresh-polished shoes clacking down the marble foyer, he could see the entourage of press standing outside.\n\nWalking through the revolving glass door, Bobby stopped before the press. He eyed them up with a smile as they begged for comment. An NBC reporter shoved a microphone in his face, asking what he thought of George Wallace's recent claims about his speech yesterday. Bobby straightened his tie. "It is my opinion," he said, "that Governor Wallace is being slightly hyperbolic and hypocritical."\n\n"I have spent the better part of my life making a career out of politics, when he claims I am new to it. He claims that I am attempting to divide the National Progressive Party and his state; rather, when I spoke yesterday, I was drawing attention to injustice, which should be unacceptable to the party and to Alabama. As for 'dividing his state', I do not believe his state was ever behind him in the first place. As I recall, the last gubernatorial election in Alabama had a little over 300,000 registered white voters, and less than 20,000 black voters, even though black people comprise a quarter of Alabamans. When election day rolled around, there were almost 290,000 votes cast by white voters, and less than 2,000 by black ones. Draw your own conclusions from that, but I say that I could not divide the State of Alabama against George Wallace because it never truly was united behind him in the first place. Good day."\n\nWith that, Kennedy and Humphrey passed through the mob of press and hopped into the black Lincoln Continental. "Wow," Humphrey said. "Wow is right," replied Kennedy, "I'm sick of Wallace's shenanigans. Now, I'm still on the fence about going on to Florida. I thought maybe we could head back to Washington.""

He looked out over the city of Knoxville, Tennessee, where they had stopped for the night. The wind on the hotel balcony they stood on was strong, but almost balmy. It would have been perfect had it not been for the day's events. "I couldn't get a word in edgewise. Every time I opened my mouth he would scream over me. Made me look like a goddamn fool. I've already gotten calls from 3 party members, all from different wings. They asked me what the hell happened."\n\n"I know," said Humphrey, "it's a rough business, especially when dealing with an animal like Wallace."\n\nBobby sighed, watching the distant flashing light of an airplane as it silently moved across the night sky.

In front of him, he reckoned there were about 10,000 people, most of them young, and a lot holding surfboards.\n\n"Before I begin, I want to give my appreciation for the very warm welcome that I've been given by the beautiful city of Miami," Bobby said over the muffled laughter of the few who got  the joke. "The people of Florida are a diverse and freedom-loving group. This state saw, and continues to see, migration from all over the country. You have a bit of Southern values, Yankee ingenuity, and Western free-spirit. You are a microcosm of the diversity of America..."\n\n"...Despite the presence of totalitarian and communist regimes less than 100 miles from here, you have managed to maintain the freedom-loving nature that binds our union together in the darkest of times. If that nature is to be maintained, these communist elements must not be allowed to set foot on American soil."\n\nAfter speaking for more than 20 minutes, Bobby was hot, sweating, and unbelievably thirsty, he excused himself from the platform and left with his entourage of Secret Service and aides in tow.

Bringing a country together was hard work, and who knows how successful he would be in the first place.\n\nHe walked over to the massive swivel chair that sat between the windows and the desk. He sat down, kicking back and breathing in an atmosphere of relaxation. The charity for all campaign had seemed to be a nominal success, but it was hard to tell so soon after all the work was said and done. Bobby didn't think a campaign like that had ever been attempted by a sitting president. So many hours going over fine details with dozens of different speeches with dozens of writers.

Despite attempts to pass the bill as quickly as possible, resistance in both houses was strong and excessively prolonged, with senator Barry Goldwater filibustering the act for nearly ten hours before conceding defeat and allowing its passage.\n\nThe Social Security Act is the next addition to a laundry list of recently passed welfare programs, part of a greater initiative by President Robert Kennedy to expand the government's role in financial aid. By creating a system by which the government can dole out financial benefits to retired or disabled citizens, Kennedy has promised to create a safety net that any American can fall back on once they can no longer take care of themselves. To prevent widespread abuse of these benefits, the age at which citizens are eligible to start collecting money has been set to 65.\n\nAlready, critics of Social Security have spoken out in protest of the bill, accusing the act of being heavily flawed. Chief among their complaints is the mandatory contribution by Americans to maintain the system, which they say creates another unneeded burden on the working class. Still others have called it an example of excessive government overreach, something many Americans see as dangerous. Nonetheless, popular support for the act has been widespread, and many lawmakers consider Social Security a victory. Last night, President Kennedy held festivities with his cabinet in celebration."

Through earmarks, categorical grants, and other means, he has recently cooperated with Congress to send million of dollars to food banks and shelters in all parts of the United States. Millions of dollars from the federal government will now be used to provide meals to America's poor so no American goes hungry.\n\nThis act has garnered widespread support from both sides of the political aisle, with many praising his initiative. Democratic lawmakers, have been especially supportive, with many voting for and often supporting President Kennedy's food bank programs. Senator Lyndon B.

Civil Rights has been one of the most divisive issues in American discourse this century, and it is time to finally put it to rest by passing a strong Act to end the practice once and for all.\n\nOur supermajority in congress means President Kennedy will face no challenges there, giving us a lot of freedom in deciding the final contents of the Civil Rights Act. While congress won't pose any difficulties, however, our own party might prove trickier to handle. The Far-Right wing is already concerned about their waning influence, and are firmly against Civil Rights. We can't let them stop us from passing a strong bill, of course, but we might want to show a modicum of restraint in how fast and hard we push desegregation. They still command a lot of influence in the Southern States. Influence which, if we push them too hard, they might turn against our administration.\n\nWe have three drafts for consideration. All of them end the practice of segregation, ban Jim Crow laws and prohibit discrimination of Americans on the basis of color. The first of the drafts contains no further provisions. The second option aims to also empower the disenfranchised by mandating equal representation in state senates and positions and equal funding for schools. The third and most radical of the drafts aims to also counter the effects of segregation by mandating action policies for political offices, all official institutions, university admissions and officer ranks in the military. All three options will surely anger the Far Right, but the more radical drafts are sure to cause a much stronger reaction. How far shall we go?"

After all the talks, and the schmoozing, and the gladhanding, and the endless fucking heart-rending compromises, Thurmond and his goons were just going to dig their heels in the mud and refuse to move, like an ornery camel. All that work wasted, just so the right-wingers of the party could keep their flagging dream of a segregationist future alive. So much for bipartisanship.\n\nBipartisanship.

If he did this, he would forever alienate the rightists by cutting them out of the legislative process of his administration.\n\nEh, fuck 'em, he thought.

Why is it that in a country with the grandest skyscrapers, and all the land to build and grow communities, still have tens of thousands of homeless people? Why is it in a nation with the best schools and hospitals that even our enemies leaders send their children to study in or to have their cancers cured, have illiteracy at all or have millions dying in pain and misery?\n\n "The simple fact is that for far too long, we have expected every American to lift themselves up, to climb up and out of the deep trench of poverty by their own merits, strengths and abilities, to join the American Dream that we all share. That system, which we call a meritocracy and take such pride in, has a great flaw though. There are some people who, no matter how hard they work, how hard the struggle, how much they save, how careful they are with their health, are struck by the misfortunes of fate, and are cast down into that pit of despair, unable to scramble out. In the White House, I receive stories like these, every day via letter and telegram, as I visit every state and city and county. It is heartbreaking to want to help those that, through little or no fault of their own, have been pushed into that trench of poverty.\n\n "So, instead I say let's help those that need it, everyone in that deep, dark hole that they were dumped into. Those that are sick, we should heal. Those that have been maimed, we should lift up. Those that are homeless, we should shelter. Those that are scraping by, we should give a helping hand.

And yet, there he stands, balding head gleaming under the television lights and slick with sweat.\n\nHe doesn't speak about segregation or states' rights, to the relief of the countless enemies that he's already made. He acknowledges his unelected status, he says all the important shibboleths of unity and patriotism. He eulogizes Robert Kennedy, America's latest fallen prince. Without any knowledge of who Strom Thurmond is, the casual viewer might feel confident in this new president. Their anxieties might be soothed for the moment.

But in order to even begin the process of expanding healthcare to more people, Bobby has to get his party onside to support him, which is easier said than done. While everyone in the party is generally in favor of increasing health spending and getting more doctors and hospitals, it's the nitty-gritty details that are causing issues that will have to be dealt with.\n\n There are three general directions the president can go: he can pitch his idea to cover the largest number of Americans as possible, an almost fully national health system that many other nations have been establishing around the world. The problem is that some of the more radical members of the C-NPP may be a bit iffy about the more vague and generalized terms, and the fact that it wouldn't be a full, government run and managed health insurance system.\n\n President Kennedy can also focus on specific areas of the nation that have worse health systems due to their intrinsic poverty and lack of development, such as Mississippi and Alabama. While the FR-NPP will undoubtedly support this measure, the lack of support in struggling cities in the north or rapidly growing cities in the west will be seen as a slap in the face.\n\n Finally, the President can instead focus this as a civil rights issue, that this new plan will help African Americans and other marginalized peoples in the US, as they are usually denied the same health coverage and benefits that white people so easily receive. Most of the party will support this measure, though it will come at the expense of support from the FR-NPP, especially the segregationists that have already made such a nuisance and fuss over schools.\n\n All in all, there is no easy answer, but Robert Kennedy has to make a choice."

His letter, simply titled, 'Is this what we voted for?' has received a fair bit of attention from the media, coinciding with President Kennedy's recent decisions in respect to Japan.\n\nThe letter addresses fellow right leaning NPP members, urging them to reconsider reelecting President Kennedy.

Their joint call pleads for President Kennedy to take into consideration the wishes of his fellow party members, and to heed their advice and inclinations.

For too many years have police officers been allowed to take a -break- for 6 months while recovering, and then come back to the force as if nothing ever happend. For even more serious cases, early retirements have been the norm.\n\nThis is not and never was okay, it is a custom that systematically gives police officers the freedom to exercise their power beyond their mandate. It pardons police officers who accidentaly shoot innocent people, and even worse crimes. Kennedy's sent a clear message to the police in our nation that such action will no longer be tolerated.\n\nThe note was leaked to the press and progressives across the country celebrate the President's clear voice in such matters. Republican-Democratic voters are more sceptical, conservatives in the Democrats argue that the President should not interfere in the judicial branch, that the president should keep his powers limited to the executive domain. Republicans on the other hand are more concerned with how this might limit police efficiency. The results of Kenney's routines are of course yet to be seen, may they be good despite any criticism!"

The instructions on the letter were simple: For the next year, you will be receiving the same amount of money every month. There was no catch: no requirements, no stipulations to how you may spend this money: bills, clothes, housing, or just saving it, all was fine. And best of all, it would be tax free. The important thing was to keep track of what you did spend it on, and at the end of every month, they would receive a phone call and envelope with a short questionnaire to fill in, to be mailed back.\n\n Soon, the rumors began to spread that the government was just giving money to random people, which quickly began to work it's way back through the political grapevine, and soon the "Citizens Basic Income Experiment" was exposed via the Washington Post. The President has defended the program in a White House press conference, stating that the goal of the Citizens Basic Income was to provide a baseline, guaranteed income that would help the poorest Americans make ends meet, and that it was just a year long trial to see the results.\n\n The opposition has come from two sides: Those in the Democrats and the FR-NPP who denounce "government handouts" to random people, which would be incredibly expensive, especially in the light of all the other Social Security programs Bobby has been pushing. But there are some in the C-NPP and the L-NPP who say that RFK hasn't gone far enough: he should be paying even more money, to more people, for longer.\n\n Facing this backlash, the President has to respond, and quickly."

He may see the President as not doing enough or going too slow in efforts to reform the American economy and society, and with hundreds of thousands of supporters throughout the US, but focused especially in the Southwest, his influence could sink or swim the efforts to reform America.\n\n But the only way to get Chavez's support is to talk to him and convince him."

This is just a small step on the way to true equality and justice, but we support the President's efforts to advance our rights."\n\n This was the best outcome possible from the meeting, as now many labor leaders in the C-NPP and supporters are vocally supporting RFK's new acts and laws, as Chavez's full-throated endorsement is just the sign they needed."

I cannot in any good conscience support Kennedy's agenda at this time."\n\n This is a huge blow to President Kennedy's plans, with many of the union men of the C-NPP now recoiling and declining to endorse President Kennedy's new acts, as Chavez's denunciation has given many in the party second thoughts of working with RFK."

Each speech, from the big auditoriums of the cities to the small stages at county fairs, convinces more and more people that the plan, while big and bold, will undoubtedly help millions of Americans that need it.\n\n In Cleveland, Ohio, as Bobby Kennedy climbs off the stage after giving another speech at the Public Auditorium, he is greeted by a huge crowd of supporters and well wishers, as Secret Service agents keep out a nervous eye, aides hurry up to follow the President, and news photographers and reporters from local newspapers and from the Associated Press hustle up to get a good shoot as he begins to glad handle the crowd.\n\n It was the later group that Bobby was most concerned about, as the pictures that they took would be printed in newspapers around the country. Therefore, even before he walked out on stage to give his speech, he was discussing with advisors what to do when he was done. It was important that he got the right look, the right message across on who he would first shake hands with first, undoubtedly the most likely image to be seen tomorrow morning from coast to coast.\n\n Should he shake hands with a man in the crowd with a FR-NPP button pinned to his chest, an average Joe to show that he was willing to work with his entire party? Or perhaps the head of the Cleveland chapter of the NAACP, to show the strong bond that RFK has with the African-American community? Or maybe the head of the Typographical Workers Union Local 53, which is one of the oldest unions in the city, to show solidarity with the working class?\n\n It had been in the back of the President's mind from the moment he started his speech, and now, with fractions of a second to think, he stretches his hand out to thank..."

Everyone of us needs to pitch in to help the underprivileged and poor, the sick and broken, so that everyone can reach their full potential. For only then, when all Americans, in all 50 states, in every community great and small, help their neighbors, family and friends, can we finally defeat the disease and scourge of poverty that has plagued humanity for thousands of years.\n\n "So I call on all Americans, from New York to San Francisco, from Minneapolis to Houston, and all the points in between: your communities need you. Volunteers and donations are needed for an innumerable number of organizations tackling everything from school lunches to adult literacy to homeless shelters. Donating your time or your money, or both, is a great way to tell your community: 'We will not leave you behind. We will help you. We will keep you warm, fed and safe.'"\n\n The applause as Bobby Kennedy finishes his speech is deafening, as he waves to the crowd and showing off his famous smile. Statistics already show that the poverty rate in America is decreasing with the boost to welfare, the support for medical services, and the improvement of labor rights. For the cherry on top, the National Progressive Party, which is famous for not agreeing on anything, somehow has all come together to support the President's work.\n\n All in all, a job well done."

It is imperative that we break the cycle of poverty and lift our poor and dispossessed out of that dark abyss. It is our duty, as rulers, as fellow Americans, to ensure that all our people can rise out of poverty and be provided with the opportunities they need to pursue happiness.\n\nOn his journeys across America, President Kennedy has seen poverty as no other politician has. Children starving in Mississippi, farm workers treated like slaves in California, blacks across the South living in utter destitution. He saw it all, and behind the proud faces of the men, he saw the shame, the desperation, the resignation. He saw the emptiness in the children's eyes, eyes from which the light had long ago guttered out, and thought of his own children.\n\nThose images of pain and degradation remained with him, consuming his waking thoughts, haunting his dreams. He knew he had to do something, for whenever he closed his eyes he saw those dark, shrunken faces, crying out for their saviour.\n\nBut Rome was not built in a day. The President knew to his eternal consternation that poverty was, like everything else, twisted into a political issue by the cruel vipers of Washington. The aid of Wallace and his cronies could be vital to the success of his first salvo of anti-poverty legislation, but would their support be worth the price?"

It seems that he'd prefer government revenue to gather dust in a vault somewhere, but what would be the good of that?

On my travels across this great nation, the world's richest, I have seen into the abyss of poverty that so many of our brothers and sisters are born into and die in, a miasma of depression from which there is no escape, even for the willing, who are not provided the tools and resources to better their lives. It is a fallacy, too often espoused by the callous and uncaring, that people who are in poverty choose to be there, or are rightfully deprived of the means to the pursuit of happiness due to their colour, or class, or faith. When any American denies to extend a helping hand to his fellow citizen, he denies America. Some are happy to turn their heads, or to snatch crumbs out of the mouths of the hungry, but I will not stand idly by while American children starve, while American women die in childbirth, while American workers are paid too little to support their families. We are better than that. We have the means to lift every American out of the depths of poverty, and I intend to make that beautiful dream a reality. In the coming years, my administration will dedicate itself to the creation of innovative new agencies and programs to provide much-needed welfare to impoverished Americans nationwide. We shall not rest until every American is provided the means to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, those three unalienable rights that have been denied to all too many. Thank you, and God bless the United States of America."\n\nIn his darkened mansion, a man watched the President's address.

While they almost universally support Robert Kennedy as President, there are two wings that have their own interests and policy goals. While often allied on many issues, the few conflicting points are just that much harder to deal with.\n\n On one hand, you have the union guys: labor leaders seeking to expand the power of worker's unions in the face of the big corporations and hostile moneyed interests, protecting and increasing the rights to collective bargaining, safer working conditions, and job security. On the other hand are the social welfare proponents: seeking to strengthen the "safety net" to catch those that fall through the cracks, tackling poverty and homelessness, and giving every American the chance to make a decent living, usually through higher taxes on the rich.\n\n The problem is that it's damn near impossible to push both agendas at the same time, partially due to the opposition that would come from those rich and powerful fatcats that would rather keep their power over the workers and their vast fortunes away from those that need it. So that leaves the President with two options: either focus his political capital on trying to boost pensions for the public and private sector that will help unionized workers, or to increase the federal minimum wage to help those stuck on the bottom of society.

But the speech has also outrage from across the nation. Many citizens are considering what the President has said as little more than slander, painting all the cops in the nation based on a few bad apples.Police unions from New York to Los Angeles are in an uproar, denouncing the President and vowing to use their resources to support politicians that actually give a damn about the police and public safety.\n\n Even in the National Progressive Party, RFK has received major blowback. Some in the FR-NPP have denounced the President, saying that he's not patriotic enough to support those that preserve law and order. Some have even shifted their loyalty from the NPP to the Democrats in response. Meanwhile, some members of the C-NPP, especially those that are really more concerned with the threat posed from outside the nation by Japan and fascism than with civil rights in America, are moving into the FR-NPP camp, thinking that the President has gone too far. After all, police forces from the FBI to county sheriffs have been busy trying to root out the dangers of spies and agitators, and it's not helping to have their methods and motives questioned.\n\n Needless to say, the speech may have done a lot to expose the bad aspects of the men (and the slowly increasing number of women) who police the nation and their power, but the political cost to Bobby Kennedy could have been much stronger than he could have anticipated."

Sol could hardly call him a conservative, but he'd not quite lived up to the promise of liberal reform he'd embodied back then either.\n\nSol was too old to believe in a messiah, but he couldn't help but feel faintly betrayed. Yet, he supposed, it was hardly uncommon in America to say one thing and mean another. Shit, they were better than the Nazis, but even so they were a nation of swindlers and con-men at heart. Still, perhaps the President was just having trouble getting things done with all them dumkopfs in Congress? It was probably easier for him to make his brothers' wives get along at Yom Kippur than it was for Kennedy to keep the NPP together. Nevertheless, Sol couldn't see himself getting fooled into wasting his time at the ballot box again.\n\nThe bell rang over the door, right on time. "Mrs. Stein, shalom!

She'd basically marched all her neighbours to the polling booth to cast their vote for him, and this was how he repaid his staunchest supporters, with empty platitudes, unfulfilled promises, and outright lies?\n\nMore fool she, Diana thought, for believing a white man would prove their deliverance. They were all alike, only interested in using black folk for their own gain. Diana could feel the room breathing as one, every person there as incandescent in rage at their betrayal as she was. The main lesson they'd taken from Kennedy's deception was that they would have to be their own salvation, take matters into their own hands to free their communities from the Klan devils that ran the state, because the President wouldn't.\n\nFace contorted, the speaker continued. A representative from the leftist faction of the NPP, Kennedy's patchwork quilt of a party, he said they were committed to civil rights and racial equality, that a significant portion of the party leadership were black. They even had black women in decision-making positions. None of the others had that.\n\nFeeling her resolve harden, Diana decided to investigate this group further.

After a few years of toil, Frank met a new guy at the plant who began to speak quietly to the others about labour rights, and that most forbidden topic: unions. Eventually, he invited Frank and some of the others to a meeting. That was how Frank Gordon became a communist.\n\nOf course he'd had the nagging sensation that they were just using him, but all the suits in Washington did was smile and lie. He grew to hate them with a passion that burned within him like hot coals, that everlasting fury becoming the only thing keeping him going, day after day, one miniscule paycheck after another.\n\nAt first, Frank had thought Kennedy to be just another smiling white snake like the rest of them, but when his wife became a fervent supporter of his, Frank had been forced to reevaluate him. His policies had begun to affect his own quality of life, raising his living standards to a level he'd never thought possible. All those years the bosses grew fat off their toil while they could barely scrape enough together to pay the bills, and what had the communists accomplished other than talking endlessly?\n\nFinishing one door and moving to the next, Frank decided to begin stepping back from the communists.

But there are some members of the C-NPP, and even further to the left, that say the bill doesn't go far enough: there will be some, like the elderly and disabbled, who will have to jump through hoops and may struggle to get the aid they need, so the restrictions should be even further loosened, and the payments increased even more.\n\n But over all, it seems that most congressmen were willing to support the Social Security Act, which will expand the number of people that can receive it, cut the red tape that drains so much money from a system that is supposed to help people who have fallen on hard times or those too old to work any more, and not belittle and humiliate them. The SSA, first and foremost, is to be a safety net to catch those that fall through society's cracks: the poor, the homeless, the injured, the elderly.\n\n In a statement released to the press after the announcement of the passing of the bill, President Kennedy said that he will be signing the law tomorrow to make it law, and thanked all those that voted in favor of the act for their "...compassion, humanity, and care for the less fortunate in our nation that would otherwise be cast aside or ignored.""

The opposition from fiscal hawks, free-market advocates, small-government supporters and the lobbyists of the health insurance and healthcare industries was too much, and public support, while generally in favor of lower cost healthcare, more access, and more accountability, turned against the NHA that would have ensured those reforms. Instead, the old status quo, of denying care due to inability to pay, lack of access because of unprofitability, and the stream of fraud and malpractice allegations, will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\n It remains to be seen if universal healthcare will ever be given to the American people."

As the wind rushed in from Lake Michigan at the soup kitchen on Lake Paulina street, chilling him to his bones, he cupped the bowl delicately as he turned into the shelter, not wanting to waste a single drop before he could guzzle it down. \n\nHe didn't make eye contact with the young woman who had handed him the bowl. She was younger than the usual crowd manning the soup line, who would sometimes look at Alfred with a mixture of disdain and self importance. Charity, they called it; and while Alfred was grateful to have a square meal a day on the freezing streets, he'd prefer it if it didn't come with a side of pitying condescension. \n\n"You forgot this!" A tug on his elbow brought Alfred back to his senses, as the young woman from the line pushed a bundle of crackers, an apple, and a few sachets of powders, stamped with 'Vitamin Supplements - American Economic Opportunity Commission' on the side. "For the soup. You won't catch a cold or the flu with that." \n\n"Thanks," Alfred grunted, pointedly refusing to pick up the vitamins. "Don't you have things to be doing?" \n\nThe lady blinked, but never broke eye contact with Alfred, before replying:"

 USA_har_68_harrington_presidency_desc:0 "They said it couldn't be done, but for the first time in American history, a self-declared socialist (even if some in his party disagree) has been elected to the White House. Michael Edward Harrington Jr, centre-left firebrand of the NPP, was raised to the Highest Office on a platform of workers' rights, progressive legislative reform and what Harrington describes as a "Fight for the Poor", a comprehensive assault on the poverty and lack of institutional support faced by many of America's faceless poor.\n\nThe latter will involve comprehensive welfarist legislation on a scale unseen in American politics. Unemployment funds, veteran pensions and assistance for the handicapped and aged have polled well with audiences, and will likely be keystones of the Harrington agenda.\n\nThis root and branch reform is expected to consume the majority of the President's term in office and will face stiff opposition from Harrington's many political enemies, including many from within his own party's conservative and radical right-wing faction. But if the earnest young ex-Catholic knows anything at all, it's how to wage a just war - and this war will be the most righteous of all."

 USA_har_68_shake_things_up_desc:0 "One of Harrington's first goals for his new administration will be simple: to make his presence known. The Beltway is full of those who would deride and oppose his efforts to bring reform to the systems that shelter them; in a coordinated mix of meetings and speeches, Harrington intends to make it clear that the lobbyists, cronies and career politicians choking America will be shown no quarter in his efforts to save it. Class privilege, money politics, the wealthy elite; everything will have to go. There will be no sacred cows left untouched in the pursuit of justice for the American people.\n\nIn this, Harrington will be met halfway by those loyal to his cause in his party. A slew of proposals regarding radical reforms to judicial terms, healthcare and pension reform are already being drafted by NPP-Left and moderate members, blowing the winds of change all the way to the Capitol Hill. Of course, he could also use this as a method of parsing support for his programmes and policies within the R-D front; for enemies are best kept closer than friends, especially ones who happen to agree with you..."

His policies will target the weak, vulnerable and faceless of American society, the "other America", and to drum up support from restive urban Evangelicals and religious ruralites Harrington has emphasized the essential continuity of welfarism with the teachings of the Bible and human decency. The aim is to make the hand of the state benign to the American mind, drawing from the Social Gospel of earlier decades to do so.\n\nOf course, this morality will serve a somewhat less innocent role in pinpointing potential sources of support for the planned legislative reforms being drawn up in NPP-Centre headquarters, and certainly might help in easing some of the more aggressive policies we have planned under the noses of voters. The American people know better than to look a gift horse in the mouth; and this horse now rides with the Eagle and the Cross, bright enough to blind any stray eyes that might wander too near."

Behind every threat, however, stands an opportunity; if we make efforts to ensure the Party stands together, we might find ourselves better-positioned to push legislature through in the halls of power. Intimidation and threats of expulsion from the Party might convince the majority to toe the Party line, and talks with Wallace and Thurmond will help ensure the major power brokers in our own party stay loyal.\n\nAfter all, wasn't it Lincoln who said that a house divided cannot stand? We might have to promise dilution of some of our most incendiary reforms in the bargain, and our own support base won't be happy about this, but unity comes at a cost, and the NPP can't afford to sacrifice its legislative power on the altar of ideological purity..."

Our ability to keep a consensus running amidst what some have described as "political schizophrenia" will surely be hailed as a great work of political maneuvering; only time will tell if it will be enough. No one knows how the Rep-Dems will react to a United NPP, of course, but the sheer weight of support for the bill might entice establishment mavericks to jump on the bandwagon."

It simply wouldn't do to neglect such a valuable source of political capital, and nothing gets the American people cheering faster than a rare display of cross-aisle unity.\n\nMeetings between Lyndon Johnson, Congressman Rusk and Harrington's staff will begin this process of reconciliation.

The fact that neither side agrees on precisely what those reforms will entail only adds to the mystique surrounding this sudden bipartisan shift.\n\nThe next logical step would be to make what is already obvious public knowledge: by consolidating the support of what some are describing as the "Newer Dealers", Harrington's circle will be able to force a confrontation with the conservatives in the NPP, but on his terms.

The popular support we will gather will be critical to mustering support against a conservative establishment hotly opposed to "big government" intervention, and sweeping aside any of our own party with personal reservations on the programme.\n\nIt will also act as a decision point for many of the political figures who have remained indecisive in their support for our programmes; by forcing them to take a stance for or against the Fight, we will bring their real sympathies and prejudices into the light of day. Our own advisers suggest that this will work to our advantage.

It is not lost on us, of course, that these movements expect concrete policy measures that benefit their causes in return for their support.\n\nHarrington's aims to conduct a series of widely publicised policy debate meetings with prominent figures in the Progressive "front" from trade unions to senators, solidifying their support for our cause while assuring them that their needs will be met in our subsequent legislation through debate over our planned programmes.

Meetings with the leaders of the AFL-CIO and the influential Brotherhood of Teamsters, as well as leaders from our own government's public sector unions, will assure the labor movement of Harrington's support, and provide a platform for valuable discussion on Harrington's increasingly public workplace rights policy agenda.\n\nThis is not going to come without its challenges, however; the labor movement is known for its socialist tendencies and our association with them could risk alienating the more conservative parts of our already fragile voter base. Pundits threaten economic disaster if we allow the power of unions to run roughshod over the market.

The co-option of his base to our own could prove a powerful statement to the labor movement in America, as well as a personal moral victory for the unabashedly pro-worker Harrington over the establishment he despises. The plan outlined in the Oval Office is to meet with him first privately and then in public with his fellow Farm Workers' Union heads, assuring him of our support.\n\nIt will be difficult to placate an already worried America about the nature of the talks, of course, and many on the airwaves are already railing against the "Red takeover of America" implied by such a bold move by the POTUS, but Harrington built his campaign on the promise that he would not forget the poor, and promises are the lifeline of politicians in America."

It's high time we began talks with the Senate powerbrokers to ensure a favourable outcome to our proposed bills - at least on paper. Senators Lyndon Johnson and McGovern on the RepDem side of the aisle are difficult to work with and it's likely we'll have to smooth over many of our personal grievances to make a deal with them viable, but they seem to be the best option we have to reach a divided Congress.\n\nHarrington's plan is this; to emphasise the "unity" of the New Progressive Movement, he will lead closed-door talks with LBJ, McGovern and other RepDem senators, smooth out the...kinks in our relationship, and leave arm in arm with the Senate in his pocket. Some of our own in the Centre say this plan is wildly optimistic and might leave us prone to attack by the fringes of our movement, but it seems like the best opportunity we have to sway the halls of power to our side - and inaction is something we simply can't afford."

As a representative of the interests of the people, these organizations are our best bet for reaching the common man directly, outside politics and the workplace.\n\nThis should be fairly easy to accomplish in theory, but as with everything else there are complications in practice; who do we meet and what do we prioritise?

Whether we follow this up with said reforms is up to the administration at large, but a sizeable minority of the Centre are against further strains on an already ballooning legislative agenda, and our political capital grows more fragile by the day.

More pragmatically, he will promise increased spending on education and infrastructure for America's rural stragglers, and even an expansion of farming subsidies to ease the burden of America's breadbasket.

 USA_har_68_the_right_to_water_desc:0 "The only thing more key to human survival than food is water. Empires have risen and fallen over who controls it. Certainly the American people have a right to the lifeblood of humanity? The way President Harrington sees it, there is no right more basic than the right to water. Through discussion and debate, President Harrington can certainly show congress that water is a key, basic right of the American people."
 USA_har_68_the_right_to_shelter:0 "The Right to Shelter"
 USA_har_68_the_right_to_shelter_desc:0 "Perhaps more controversially, President Harrington believes the American people have a right to shelter. But don't they? The American dream promises a family, a job, and a house. Famously, President Hoover promised "A Chicken in Every Pot and Two Cars in Every Garage". But what of Americans with no pot and no garage? Don't they deserve the same opportunity? Thus, a right to shelter. Surely, Congress will agree."

 USA_har_68_the_hunger_bill_desc:0 "Think for a moment, on how many Einsteins have died in the gutter. How many Shakespeares? How many Washingtons? Did they not deserve the same chance as their successful counterparts? In President Harrington's America, there will be no more lost art, no more forgotten breakthroughs. In President Harrington's America, we will say that every man was created equal and we will mean it. The government is there to protect and provide for the American people, and through the Hunger Bill, it'll finally be doing that. The American people have certain inalienable rights. The right to freedom of speech. The right to vote. And now, the right to sleep soundly, knowing that they will not have to find their next meal out of a dumpster."
 USA_har_68_managing_unemployment:0 "Managing Unemplyoment"
 USA_har_68_managing_unemployment_desc:0 "What good is an economy without workers? To secure positive, fair, and free working conditions for the people of America, we must first secure them a job. If we can give every American a good, stable, and most of all, fair job, than we can give America a strong, and truly equal, economy."
 USA_har_68_job_corps:0 "Establish the Job Corps"
 USA_har_68_job_corps_desc:0 "Every American deserves a solid opportunity to learn important skills to join the workforce, especially our young people. President Harrington plans to create a "Job Corps", to teach Americans from the ages of 16 to 24 the value of good work. They will spend about half their time working in National Parks, to help maintain and improve said parks, and spend the other half improving both their basic academic education and their job specific vocational training. In this, we can make sure a new generation of Americans gets the same, if not better, opportunities than their parents."

 USA_har_68_tackle_abusive_practices_desc:0 "Our Founding Fathers secured this nation as one of freedom, equality, and liberty. Why then, are these very concepts crushed daily by the boot of lopsided employer-employee relationships? Though, it's hardly as far as we must go to really free the workers of America, for now, we can at least seek to crush overtly abusive practices."
 USA_har_68_unemployment_benefits:0 "Building the Safety Net"
 USA_har_68_unemployment_benefits_desc:0 "We must make sure every American is protected, and we certainly cannot throw throw those who either cannot work or who are simply between jobs under the bus. We need to create some kind of "safety net" for Americans who need it. There are those in America who cannot afford to get a job. The price of gas, a nice outfit, childcare, "team building exercises". The prices rack up, and soon, people can't break out of the cycle of poverty. President Harrington says no more! Through a system of unemployment benefits, all Americans will have the basic means to survive while finding work."
 USA_har_68_paying_for_it_all:0 "Paying for it All"
 USA_har_68_paying_for_it_all_desc:0 "While the concepts of a "Job Corps" and of unemployment benefits are noble, and downright necessary, they are concepts that can be somewhat expensive.

 USA_har_68_paying_their_fair_share:0 "Paying their Fair Share"
 USA_har_68_paying_their_fair_share_desc:0 "In America (and, in fact, the world), most of the wealth is tied up in the bank accounts of the super wealthy, people with so much sheer wealth, they could never realistically spend it all. Rather than wait for all this wealth to trickle down, which would be downright absurd, we must take proactive action, and secure funding for our welfare programs by making the superrich pay what they owe."

 USA_har_68_consider_cutting_the_military_desc:0 "Imagine a different world than our own for a moment. Imagine that the United States Armed Forces were able to invade Europe and crush the gray menace. Imagine that the United States of America were left the sole hegemon of a war-torn world, policing and rebuilding countries that cannot rebuild and police themselves. Now pull your head out of your ass. That world is far, far, away from our own. The US is decidedly not the sole hegemon of the world, and we are definitely not using our armed forces to rebuild Europe and Asia. We simply don't need such a large standing army, especially when you consider the fact that large scale conventional war is essentially dead in the water thanks to M.A.D. At most, our army is going around the world containing the rise of facism through smaller proxy conflicts. With the sheer amount of money tied up in the military, wouldn't it make sense to downsize our bloated military, and use the freed up cash to pay for programs that can help Americans right now?"
 USA_har_68_how_much_to_raise_taxes:0 "How Much to Raise Taxes?"
 USA_har_68_how_much_to_raise_taxes_desc:0 "Americans are fundamentally good, friendly people. They like helping people, especially their fellow countrymen. The flip side of that coin, however, is that Americans are not very fond of taxes. It's a delicate balancing act; new programs are generally supported, but new taxes are reviled. However, with the experts in the Harrington Administration, we can surely walk that line, so less fortunate Americans are protected, and the quiet grumbles of more fortunate Americans stay quiet."
 USA_har_68_drawing_up_a_budget:0 "Drawing up a Budget"
 USA_har_68_drawing_up_a_budget_desc:0 "With some major questions settled, it's time to actually create a formal budget proposal. This is our opportunity to really show the American people our priorities. With this budget, we can now put our money where our mouth is, as it were."
 USA_har_68_social_security:0 "[Root.GetHAR_social_security_bill]"
 USA_har_68_social_security_desc:0 "The unemployment benefits program is a great start to securing a better future for Americans, but maybe it needs to be expanded into a larger "social security" program in order to more comprehensively assist more Americans to get what they really need. Presidential nominee Franklin D. Rosevelt proposed a similar program back in the 30s, and while he was unsuccessful in securing the presidendency, the people have chosen President Harrington, which means that America is clearly ready to try the "social security" idea."
 USA_har_68_pushing_the_businesses:0 "Pushing the Businesses"
 USA_har_68_pushing_the_businesses_desc:0 "Some American businesses haven't been too happy about the new push towards better working conditions. They talk about profit margins, and Atlas Shrugged, and bureaucracy. The simple fact of the matter is that they will continue to grumble and argue for the foreseeable future, and we must apply some pressure to make sure all of America's workers are getting the solid deal we promised them."

 USA_har_68_amend_the_fair_labor_standards_act_desc:0 "Though the FLSA passed back in the late thirties, it was a near thing. In order to pass, the bill had to be cut down, and while it is a good baseline, it simply doesn't go far enough to help American workers. We must go back in and use any spare political capital to amend the FLSA to give real assistance to the working man."
 USA_har_68_working_to_solve_poverty:0 "Working to Solve Poverty"
 USA_har_68_working_to_solve_poverty_desc:0 "The symptoms have been treated. Any man can tell you the worst part of a fever is the terrible fatigue that leaves him stricken in bed, unable to eat or to laugh or to do the things a healthy man can. Just as it is with poverty, where gnawing hunger and the listlessness of unemployment leave a man just as stricken. Now, thanks to Harrington's policies, even the lowliest man can be assured that he can eat and have a reasonable chance of picking himself up.\n\nThe systems we have established should ensure that the symptoms of poverty continue to be treated for the foreseeable future. In time, the true elimination of the causes of hunger and woe should be properly addressed, but for now the poor man can rest easy."
 USA_har_68_an_america_for_all:0 "An America for All"
 USA_har_68_an_america_for_all_desc:0 "With the end of his second term drawing near, Harrington intends to once and for all define the legacy he shall leave to America. Over the last few years, the NPP has fought hard for racial equality and economic mobility for all Americans, and the President means to ensure that this ethos is maintained past his time in office.\n\nTo this end, he intends to give one of his last speeches as president at the University of Chicago, where he studied long ago. As he gives his blessing to the graduating Class of 72', he will inspire them, and hopefully all the young minds of America, with the promise of a better future that all should seek to strive for."
 USA_har_68_an_end_to_poverty:0 "An End to Poverty"
 USA_har_68_an_end_to_poverty_desc:0 "If there is one legacy future historians will attribute to President Harrington, it will be the end of the curse of poverty afflicting the lives of American citizens. Though it may still exist and continue to do so, our citizens can rest assured that poverty is no longer a pit without escape, but a simple bump in the road on the path to the American Dream. With all afforded the right to healthcare in times of illness, food in times of need, freedom from racial prejudice and ready access to work and education, ascending from the darkness needn't be a Sisyphean task any longer.\n\nThe time approaches for a new president, but the efforts Harrington has made will not be in vain. America can move on into the future as one society, undivided by wealth or opportunity. In time, this may be seen as the moment that America truly fulfilled its reputation as a land where anyone can make it to greatness"

 harrington.2.desc:0 "President Michael Harrington stood in the oval office, scratching his chin, ruminating the day's events, as well as his plans for the future. When he had come into the presidency, he had campaigned on party unity heavily, trying to inextricably tie the groups such as the Far Right to the Progressives. It was unlikely to ever work, and it was very difficult so far. Strom and his cronies had trouble cooperating with anyone, the stubborn bastards, and the future of the NPP seemed in question.\nRepublicans or the Right, that was the question. Should he pick the Republicans, it could possibly dissolve the NPP as a whole; the "big tent" would be set on fire, so to speak. Regardless, a decision had to be made. Harrington picked up the phone to his personal assistant. "Francine," he said, "I'd like to schedule a meeting with Strom Thurmond.""

"You've got to be out of your goddamn mind," he said, "you're too out there for us, and for our supporters, Harrington. You really think we'll all just roll over for socialism? Hell, why not declare Debs one of the founding fathers? Carve his face into Rushmore and hail the People's Republic of America?"\nHarrington, sitting opposite Byrd, took a sip from his coffee mug. "I think, perhaps, you are being hyperbolic."\n"Hyperbolic!" interjected Strom Thurmond, "You're one step away from a goddamn communist!"\nJeane Kirkpatrick leaned forward, looking at the President. "Listen, Mister President," she began, "understand our position: our supporters and your supporters are totally distinct groups. We need a good reason to give our support to you."\nHarrington kicked back in his chair, eyeing the men and woman opposite him. "Well, what can I do?"\n"Resignation and suicide seem obvious choices," deadpanned Thurmond.\nKirkpatrick rolled her eyes. "A fully anti-Japan stance," she said, "Saber rattling, military funding; anything to piss off the Japs. That, and hold back on some of the more radical elements of your platform, like a universal basic income. That would probably calm down some of our voters."\nHarrington rubbed his eyes, sighing. There could be no victory without sacrifice, in the end. "Alright," he said, "I can work with that.""

"You've asked me that several times already," he said, "my answer's the same: go with the Far Right. We're already radical enough in their eyes, if we don't at least make a gesture of getting along, the entire National Progressive Party might just collapse away into dust."\nHarrington sighed, "the more I ask you that the less confident I am that it's the right choice."\n"Then why ask me? Listen, Strom and Byrd would absolutely rally behind you if we-"\n"If we what?" Harrington interrupted, "If we gave up on our campaign promises, you mean. Even then, Byrd would be a hard sell, and Thurmond's not even worth trying."\n"Don't give up on him so easily," Howe replied, "he's a dog with no bite. Throw him a bone and he won't even bark."\n"The man said he'd 'sooner be in Tokyo with Tojo than in Hell with Harrington'. The Far Right- and Thurmond- are a no-go."\n"So," Howe began, "Republicans it is, then."\n"Republicans it is," agreed Harrington, reaching over to the phone. There was a meeting that needed to be called."

 harrington.5.t:0 "A Foregone Conclusion"
 harrington.5.desc:0 "Michael Harrington sat at the head of the long meeting table. Exquisite mahogany, carved, and surrounded by what must have been a little over a baker's dozen of politicians he all knew by name. McGovern, Dole, Rumsfeld, McNamara, Gore, Rockefeller, Ford, and several others. "So, gentlemen," Harrington began, "I've brought you all here today because I believe we share common interests, and may work together for those interests. I am officially asking for the support of the Republican-Democratic party going forward. Our administration needs more support to pass its legislation through Congress, and I am of the belief that an agreement between our two parties may be reached."\n"So what do you want us to do?" replied George McGovern, "I'd be willing but I won't just blindly follow you."\n"Think of it more as a bipartisan agreement for the common good," said Harrington.\n"Absolutely not," interjected McNamara, "you really think our party would rally behind you? When I tell this to the Democrats in Congress it won't be pretty."\nDole was the next to speak, "hey, now, let's not be too hasty. Yes, the President here might have a few radical ideas but we could get some serious legislation passed with this alliance."\nSeveral murmurs of approval went up around the Republican side of the table, but the few Democrats remained silent until Donald Rumsfeld stood up. "Listen to yourselves! You'd rather break up the party for some progressive pipe dream than focus on what really matters? I won't add any more fuel to this fire. Goodbye."\nWith that, he stood and walked out of the room, followed by McNamara and an inconsequential senator whom Harrington couldn't remember the name of. "Let them go," said Bob Dole, "they'll come around sometime or another. Mister President, I'm all for this alliance. Despite your more radical policies, I have great respect for you and your dedication to the well being of America. However, I'm not so sure my compatriots have such convictions. Please, give us a few minutes to discuss this."\nHarrington obligingly left the room, checking his watch every minute or so. Two minutes, four minutes, seven minutes, nine. It went on and on and on until suddenly the conference room door gently opened, with the entourage of Republicans filing out. Bob Dole stopped and looked at the President, nodding gently."

 harrington.6.t:0 "Polarized"
 harrington.6.desc:0 "In recent weeks, several of the Far Right wing of the National Progressive Party have officially walked across the aisle and joined the Democratic Party. In addition, the Democrats have decidedly grown closer to the Far Right in response. It appears that this sudden, extreme action is in response to a conference held between leaders of the Republican-Democrat Party and the Harrington Administration, in which the Republicans and the President agreed to work together. The few Democrats invited to the meeting, including Robert McNamara and Donald Rumsfeld, quickly left after they claimed the President was not interested in making compromises.\n\nThe new alliance between the Republicans and the Progressives is already visible in Congress, with the two groups voting almost unanimously on their legislative proposals. A fiery speech given by Strom Thurmond in the most recent Senate vote showed just how far the NPP has split over this issue, with Thurmond calling the President a "traitor to the party". Despite the large political shakeup, and the new counter-alliance seemingly between the Far Right and the Democrats, it appears that most poor and middle class Americans are warming up to the Harrington Administration. The same however, cannot be said for their wealthier employers, who stand to lose millions from the President's social programs."

 harrington.7.desc:0 "President Harrington has become increasingly tired with the inflexibility of the Senate. Passing his reforms in the Congress turned to be a very difficult task, encountering the inflexibility of the conservatives and even the moderates. So he decided that instead of dealing with an increasingly hostile Congress he would go back to his roots. A tour across the country will be organized to talk to the common folk and listen to their problems. This will allow to create popular support for his Progressive agenda and improve his image among those communities more hostile to him.\n\nThe reactions to the so called People's Path were mixed. Progressives applauded the President's decision of staying true to his ideals of being the "People's President" and they hope this tour can gain sympathy for the progressive cause. Some moderates sympathetic to Harrington's program voiced their concern about the project, arguing that the President should stay in Washington to focus on passing his reforms and deal with other problems. Non-progressives were more critical about it, defining the entire thing as nothing but a vanity project. Some conservatives went so far as to call the tour an attempt to "create a socialist personality cult".\n\nHarrington ignored the critiques and focused on organizing his ambitious tour. After all, these people bothered to put him in the White House. Why not return the favor?"

 harrington.8.desc:0 "President Harrington made a stop at one of the many charity centers of New York City to address the poor and the helpless. Harrington felt confident in his ability to speak to the poor: all those years of activism on his youth weren't in vain. "Look, fellas. I'm not here to make a campaign or anything like that. There are no journalists, no photographers and not even bodyguards" Harrington wasn't entirely honest with that one: they were two members of the Secret Service infiltrated inside the crowd to avoid any lunatic doing something funny. "I'm not gonna tell you "vote for me" or any of that political crap.You tell me your names and I'm gonna sit on this chair and just listen to what you have to say."\n\nAt the exact moment that Harrington sat on the chair, a hundred hands raised up and the entire room filled with the voices of dozens of people. "One at the time, please" requested Harrington. A crippled man with a long beard went first: "I'm Jack. I lost a leg fighting the Nazis in Wales. They rewarded me by screwing my fucking pension. I've been homeless for ten years." Another woman with small children on her lap was next: "I'm Brenda. My landlord expelled me and my kids from my house. I don't know what do." Then, a young black man: "I'm Terry. I'm a drug addict in recovery. People refuse to hire me and call me names on the street. I feel like I can't change anything."  Every single one of the seventy souls inside the room started to tell their stories for the next two hours.\n\nHarrington was out for words at first but he finally got up from the chair to deliver an answer. "This is outrageous. How can people suffer like this in the richest country on Earth? I'm gonna do everything I can to solve this and I'll resign in shame if I can't change anything!" The entire room cheered him, as Harrington thanked the people for his support. Local newspapers tracked the people on the meetings weeks later, reporting that their situations have improved a lot since then. President Harrington's approval ratings went through the roof in New York, with a similar result in other big urban centers."
 harrington.8.a:0 "The poor won't be left alone ever again"
 harrington.9.t:0 "Harrington Addresses the Middle Class"
 harrington.9.desc:0 "After leaving behind the big urban centers behind, Harrington wanted to address the middle classes to further push his progressive agenda. This stop in particular was particularly com: a community in Florida filled with conservative middle-aged people, a place where Harrington is really unpopular. The speech was nothing special with Harrington talking about the importance of helping fellow citizens, specially the poor. Some voices of disapproval could be heard when Harrington talked about the importance of everyone doing their part to end poverty as it was interpreted as an attempt to raise taxes. The interesting part came when Harrington announced that he would be taking questions from the crowd. His aides warned him that it was a risky strategy: if the discussion gets heated, the right-wing press was going to eat him alive.\n\nFortunately, Harrington was ready for that. The questions were mostly conservative talking points that he already heard a million times, so he had no problem answering then. However, the moment that most resonated from the event was the exchange that the President had with one person in particular. An elderly man wearing a cross-shaped necklace asked: "Why should I give my hard working money to lazy people that don't contribute anything to society, Mr President?"\n\nHarrington decided to make a gamble with his response. "I have noticed that you are a Christian, isn't it?" The man nodded proudly. "Well, while I admit I'm not a big religious person myself, I'm a bit familiar with Jesus's teachings. Didn't Jesus talked about the necessity of having compassion and pity for the poor? And knowing what he did with the merchants at the temple, I don't think he was very fond of the invisible hand of the free market." Harrington exclaimed. The reaction was mixed, with some outright booing the President but others laughing a bit. Conservative newspapers fiercely criticized the President for using Jesus to "push his heretic communist agenda", but the liberal media celebrated Harrington's witty comments on religion. The President is sure he made a good impression."

 harrington.10.desc:0 "Harrington's next stop on his People's Tour was the rural communities on the countryside. A good chunk of the rural farmers of the Rust Belt supported Harrington, so now he has to prove them that he is willing to support his campaign promises. Harrington addressed a group of corn farmers in Iowa to talk about the necessity of investing in the rural industry. He promised that more funding will be invested in subsiding the farms, improving infrastructure and creating new schools across the state. "Agriculture is one of the main cores of America, so iit would an injustice to leave you behind just like that." In what was already a recurring trope for Harrington's tour, a voice could be heard from behind the crowd. "I voted for you and now my crops are fucked, you asshole."\n\nThe Secret Service was ready to push the troublemaker out of the crowd when Harrington ordered them to stop. "Do you want to come here to talk about it? Seriously, I'm interested" Harrington exclaimed. The farmer eventually arrived to the podium and the President asked what his problem was "Those rats just fucked my entire harvest and now I don't have a penny. What am I supposed to do?" Harrington thought about it for a few seconds and eventually delivered an answer. "Those who have the same problem right now, rise your hands" At least a third of the people present raised their hands. "Well, I didn't see the rat infestation coming, but that's not excuse. Not only am I going to invest in better pesticides, but also compensate those farmers that lose their crops. What do you think?" Harrington exclaimed extending his hand. The farmer smiled and shook Harrington's hand with satisfaction "That sounds like a pretty good deal!" The event made a really good impression on the rural regions, guaranteeing a solid support base for future reforms."

 harrington.11.t:0 "Harrington Addresses the Rich"
 harrington.11.desc:0 "Harrington's last stop on his People's Path was the hardest of all. Harrington's final obstacle was the people he fought his entire life: the rich. His objective is to ensure support for his ambitious program of expansion of funding for small and medium farmers. He managed to pressure some of the Governors of the Rust Belt to help him, but now he needs the support of the most powerful rural and manufacturer businessmen in the country. A reunion was planned in Washington to address the issue, where Harrington had to negotiate with his mortal enemies for hours.\n\nThe fat cats started to talk first. "With all due respect, Mr President your actions have greatly affected our interests" a man with a cigar exclaimed. "Your aggressive rhetoric only alienates our good will to negotiate. My associates and I want to make sure that this deal will be beneficial to us." another bald executive said. Harrington immediately fired back. "Gentlemen, this can end in two ways. We associate in this project, improving your profits and we both benefit from it or we do nothing, the farmers suffer and you lose your chance for a good business. I'm open to negotiation, but I also need your compromise."  The executives were actually surprised that Harrington was willing to listen to their demands to come to an agreement. Maybe that pesky Socialist is not that dumb after all.\n\nAfter hours of negotiation and deliberating the details, the businessmen accepted moderate support for Harrington's project. "Well, Mr President my colleagues and I decided to support your project. We are confident that this partnership could benefit both parts. However, we also hope that you will respect our interests the same way we respect yours. Have a nice day." Harrington now needs to work on the bills, but after such a long tour through the country and dealing with the bourgeois he decided to take a few days to rest first."

 harrington.12.t:0 "A United NPP?"
 harrington.12.desc:0 "In recent weeks, dozens of Far Right politicians of the National Progressive Party have come out in support of President Michael Harrington, capped off today by Robert Byrd and Jeane Kirkpatrick announcing that the Far Right caucus is now standing fully behind the President and his policies. This comes as a surprising announcement to the nation, especially Far Right voters, who voted in strongly against the progressive candidate last November. Byrd himself even said that he would sooner join the Republicans than see Harrington- whom he called a communist- in office.\nNow however, the political situation appears to have shifted in favor of the Progressive Center, with the Far Right voting along in their most recent piece of legislation. Not all on the Far Right appear to have caved, with several Congressmen and politicians continuing to vehemently oppose the current administration. This group notably includes Senator Strom Thurmond, who had this to say: "I don't know what my party is doing, siding with a godless bolshevik like our current president. It saddens and angers me, and I will not give in to the tyranny of the majority; I will continue to fight for what's best for America."\nRegardless of the outliers, it appears that most of the Far Right wing is now cooperating with the Harrington Administration, and their voters appear likely to follow suit. How President Harrington was able to garner the support of a faction that has been strongly opposed to him in the past remains unknown, but a deal was likely made; one that may require the breaking of the President's campaign promises."

And everybody will be needed to mobilize voters, antagonize fence-sitting legislators, turn out to protest in favor of the administration, and help construct a coalition that the president can rely on.  Some will certainly find it distasteful, but the Harrington administration represents the best chance for radical material gain in the history of the American left.  The White House is betting that America's activists and organizers will decide Paris is truly worth a mass."

Plenty of unions, spearheaded by the Reuther brothers' United Auto Workers, threw their whole weight behind the Harrington campaign.  But others, like the IBEW, UMWA, and SMWIA, all have leadership that is much more suspicious of the President.  Many of them have powerful machines that the NPP's political efforts rely upon, which they are loath to give up and which we would regret crossing.  \n\nThere are a number of ways we could deal with America's unions, but they pretty much boil down to two major options.  On one hand, we could bank on the UAW and other progressive unions to give us more of their support.  They're more ideologically aligned with us, and are more reliable, especially in the North, but there may be backlash from moderates elsewhere in the country, which could bode poorly for our future efforts.  On the other hand, we could reach out to more moderate unions, and calm their worries about our administration.  However, it's unlikely that we have the time or the political capital to address both."

The United Farm Workers had been harrying agriculture tycoons across the Southwest for years, and their brand of grassroots labor organizing appealed to the White House.  They would be valuable allies, if Harrington could convince them.  \n\nCesar Chavez's eyes never looked away from Harrington's.  Chavez looked kind and understanding, and he was, but he was weighing and balancing every word the president said.  Every now and again, he looked to Dolores Huerta, the master of outreach and organizing, gauging her expression.  They both heard the president say the right things, about what the DOJ and congressional allies could do, about how much he admired their efforts and principles.  He made commitments to investigate abuse and mismanagement.   \n\nAnd after two hours, Chavez and Huerta nodded."

The Centrist NPP legislators who form our base of support have generally been supportive, although we've received more than one exhortation to "be careful".  The Far Right, on the other hand, have been even more livid than usual.  They see it as a betrayal of the party, and of the principles that we all ostensibly share.  At least one of the staffers manning the phones in the West Wing has broken down in the bathroom after the third expletive-laced rant from a member of the Alabama congressional delegation.

He's a progressive, yes, but also one with a strong pro-war streak.  And he's a reliable, if occasionally critical, backer of the administration.  This makes him the perfect candidate for a congressional go-between.

However committed they both were to a better future, Hall had studied at Bukharin's schools, and Harrington had protested Bukharin's government.  \n\nHall began to speak again.  \n\n"Mr. President, we do represent a number of interests that are vital for NPP political success in the future.

President Harrington was always happiest in spaces like this, full of people fighting for a more just world.  He just wasn't used to having everybody's undivided attention.  They all spoke frankly.  It was refreshing, hearing about the struggles of activists, instead of fighting with Washington bureaucrats and pork-shovelers.  One of the activists, a young graduate of Mount Holyoke who had worked to desegregate her school back in '65, stood up and spoke for the better part of half an hour, picking apart America's foundations with the skill of a surgeon.  \n\nAfter the meeting, outside the library, a professor from MIT asked for her name.

Based on how it was written, it's clear that said list was written by someone in contact with the White House previously, and that they're a member in good standing of the NPP's Far Right faction.  Every news agency worth their salt is digging for more information.  Who is this "Forrest Carter" person?  How did they get so close to the administration?  One thing is certain, though.

With every thought came another pen stroke, another massive change to the face of American life. Nevertheless, while hope pranced through the President's mind, the constant thoughts of a snake in the grass lied in the background. These thoughts persisted until the President's work was interrupted with some soft knocking at his door. Getting up to answer, President Harrington was greeted by Vice President Howe, who received a pat on the back from Harrington as he said "Irving, you surprised me! Come, sit down, I wanted to look at that report you told me about." With a smile, Howe and the President sat around his desk. \n\n "Michael,I have to admit, it's hard to imagine all those out there that get affected by this work. You're non-stop, you know that?" Irving asked, before setting a manilla folder onto the President's desk. Harrington flipped open the folder to peer into the reports laid inside. Reports, graphics, and measurements, all of which showed another slither of what lies in the grass: former southern C-NPP members defecting to the Populist branch of the FR-NPP or even the Republicans. One paragraph noted that the words "chaotic" and "exhausting" had been one of the most common trends in phone polling in regards to the fitting words describing the Presidential administration according to the American public. \n\nThe reactions of the United States provided concern, but he knew this wasn't the end. "Well, nothing like a morning filled with reports of defection." Harrington said, rubbing his chin. "Well, Mike, you know one concrete fact as well as anyone after all these years: people don't like change. Like ripping the band-aid off a papercut, you know?" Irving said with a bit of a chuckle. Harrington sat back in his chair as he reviewed the reports again. "You know, us two have probably dealt with more papercuts than any of these people, what a way to throw a fit, right?" the President said, compelling the Vice President to offer a few more bits of laughter in regards to the happiness of the President. "Don't worry, we'll get through this, if we got to the Presidency, we can get through anything they want to throw at us, right?" Harrington asked, offering his hand.

Harrington finally put his pen down and offered a small chuckle, saying, "People, fickle, huh?" before chuckling a bit more. Yet, as the President took some time for himself, work always seemed to find him as another set of knocks rang against the door of the Oval Office. \n\n"What's it look like out there on the front lines, Irving?" Harrington asked, as Vice President Howe stepped forward. Irving offered a smile and a handshake in return "Well, uh, Michael, another report came in about the defections in the South, a followup from the other day." He said, unveiling another set of reports. President Harrington took a while to carefully read through the set of paperwork, and once again, new punches thrown at his optimism came with every page. The numbers were accurate, as bases of his support continued to make moves towards joining the Republicans and the Far Right of the NPP. A bit of confusion filled him upon seeing a new growth of defections in the Rockies rather than the South. And a bit of shock came as he saw that some had reported their "tiredness" bringing them towards the Left of the NPP and the Yockeys on the other side. "What...what's going on, Irving?" the President, sounding a bit beat up, bit still cheery. The Vice President took a few seconds for the President to get his worries out before speaking, saying "Michael, you and I have worked a long time to get people to sympathize with the Progressive movement. But what's one of the biggest responses we always got whenever we made a speech or published an article?" \n\nThe President took a few slow breaths before responding, working towards building up his cheeriness once more as he thought of the years that had flown by alongside his best friend, Howe himself.

Originally, he could offer some understanding towards the citizens' concern for the rapid change, even if it helped them, because hey, change can be difficult. But now, concern has seemingly transformed into daggers launching into the President's back. \n\nHarrington watched onward as news had already predatorized the entire affair revolving around the divisions beginning to form within the NPP all across the country in regards to his cabinet's successes. Finally, the South had begun to slow down the numbers retreating towards the Far Right: if only because the majority of those willing to defect had already done so by now. And yet, as the President watched onwards, he could only feel icy betrayal as the newscaster pointed to other areas of the United States, pointing towards new, emerging areas of political upheaval. Scenes of protestors gathering in the Rockies to combat his "aggressiveness" in changing the political atmosphere, with one group leader proclaiming that "the President has frustrated the government with his radical attempts to flip the table on them as he continuously butts head with the Congress to try to get these ridiculous proposals out. They're tired, and we are too!" Every word blended together to deliver a punch to the President's gut, as he watched the black and white television broadcast images of his foundation of support, the Midwest, his own homeland, Missouri, and the Pacific, acting in defiance with small gatherings looking to turn against his actions. Every demonstration, every showcasing of the American people's exhaustion with the conflicts in Washington, every banner, every sign, every action against President Harrington served to cut away at the strings of the President's heart. "Had he not done what was right?" the President thought as he saw images of a Yockey rally in Kentucky and a brawl breaking out between C-NPP members and some Democrats and FR-NPP members in Minneapolis. \n\nWith a few knocks on the door, Vice President Howe entered the Oval Office to deliver news of the broadcast to the President.

The South had solidified their antagonistic approach to the administration, as the wave of what the critics and opposition call "exhaustion" had moved the Rockies to change. Yet even so, the venomous trail continues to seep forward, as the baseless claim of frustration has begun to sprout throughout the Pacific and the Midwest more and more. As the President continued to flip the pages, the bruises to his self conscious continued to ride his mind, causing him to relive the feelings of the television broadcast from so long ago, the feelings of loss, of betrayal. Suddenly, as Harrington walked behind his desk, essentially falling into his desk chair, a rush of more memories flooded his mind once more. This time, not with the icy feelings of the betrayal of his constituents, but of the warm connection he shared with them. Those countless hours he spent meeting up with dozens, if not hundreds of workers across the United States of America, all in desperate need of care and concern that Washington was not willing to provide for the hardworking support of the American government and economy. No, they would prefer to cut the NPP apart, leave the power to the Left who are organizing riots as we speak and the Yockeys who are going to be tearing the constitution apart the second they get close to it. \n\nAs the President brought his palms to his face to try to wipe the anger and frustration from within him, his eyes became fixated on a particular part of one of the articles in the corner of the page.

The phone line cut soon after before Harrington had the chance to respond. \n\nThe President sat leaned over his desk, silent despite his Vice President having been here to listen into the entire conversation. "So, who was that, Mike?" Howe asked. "One of the Senators of New York, another gone from the East Coast." He said in near monotone had Irving not caught the strings of emotions tied to the President's anguish. "Fuck." Harrington stated, pushing away from his desk as his face grew redder by the minute.

"Well, Mr. President, unfortunately, being tired and angry isn't going to solve the departure crisis we're seeing with members of the C-NPP, or the growth of the Yockeys across the South." Irving responded. "How bad is the party looking at this point?" Harrington asked. "Well, the South is already out of the question, every sympathetic man in the South has turned to the FR-NPP, the Democrats, or over to Yockey. The Rockies have slowed their defections, if for the only reason that there isn't any left on our side to switch over to the Republicans. Meanwhile, the very base of support you started out with, New England, the Pacific, and the Midwest are all turning over for the first time." Irving said. Harrington got up from his desk to pace around the Oval Office upon hearing the dreaded reports. "Mike, walking around the damn office isn't going to help stop Gus fucking Hall from taking all our support!" Irving barked. \n\nHarrington froze upon hearing his Vice President. Gus Hall?

In particular, Harrington had his eyes glued to the piece of paper that had made its way to his desk. A political cartoon, a source of humor for some active within the divided political world of the United States of America. For others, such as the United States, all he saw was scorn and insults as it depicted a gross misrepresentation of him taking money from blue collar white workers in the South and throwing it into a bonfire adorned with a sign marked "Welfare Program." \n\n"The daily newspaper in Mississippi seems to have taken a liking to you, Mr. President." Howe said. "What the hell did they do that for? I made these programs for them, Irving, for fucking them!" Harrington said, tightening the grip in his hands to vent his frustrations. "Easy, Mr. President. It's because Yockey's taking control across the South, and as the Far Right loses membership every day, Yockey burns your work across the South." Even as Harrington listened on, he had read the reports, he had watched the news, heard the people. Yockey may have been a bastard, that much is true; however, Hall was right on the other end of the spectrum, stealing away from the social democracy Harrington had built around himself to feed to his "proletarian" dreams. The NPP, the government, the whole damned country had been engulfed in this wildfire of partisanship and extremism. "Irving, I have a question." Harrington asked, in a tone mixed with resolve yet sorrow, as the Vice President braced himself. "Did I do all of this? Is it really my fault?" Harrington asked. Hearing the drastic question from the President, Howe took a long few minutes to think over the question. Howe knew that more than a superior, Harrington was his best friend. Someone who celebrated all their successes with him, and launched their platform into the spotlight. Someone who struggled with all their failures alongside him, and helped Irving get over all the obstacles they came up against. \n\n"Michael. It doesn't matter whether it's your fault or not.

An exhaustion seemingly grew out of the peaceful change, stable economics, democracy, and logic that Harrington so desperately tried to forward under his Presidency. Rather, all that America could muster to show to the public was the hate inside their heads. \n\nWithin the South, hell had broken out by the name of Francis Parker Yockey. The seemingly compliant Far Right wing of the NPP dominating the South had been drawn, quartered, and cannibalized by the extremists marching across the streets, advocating for the support of Fascist influence to "undo the decadence found within the system of government within the Republic," as one rally leader proclaimed in Georgia. The bastards marched up and down roads, busy intersections, anywhere and everywhere they could find attention to, and brought havoc wherever they went, forcing the African-American populations of the United States into hiding. Even the madman himself had gone up to stage, with Yockey mounting a podium and advocating that they must "rescue the ideals of Western Civilization as it decayed with the growing disgust present in the world." \n\nMeanwhile, in the North, all who had remained to support Harrington were living in the shadow of a continuously growing name for the Progressives of the United States: Gus Hall. The Communist, seeking to dually overthrow the "shackles the United States' government binds to the American worker," as a news reporter within New York City had stated. Rallies displaying Communist propaganda through the streets of the industrial north brought together the suffering workers that, alongside the unmoving political figures of Washington, hadn't remained loyal to him after working so hard for them. The Progressives of the United States had become dominated by notions of extremism and anger, but even so, wasn't the rest of the country engulfed in the same fire? \n\nEverywhere President Harrington looked, he saw a nightmare of what was meant to be a country of freedoms. Now, radicals occupied the streets as blood, tears, and fire rocked the governmental system, with only the moving forward of time able to tell what lied ahead."

Exhaustion had turned to frustration, and with frustration came action, all until the cycle repeated until one thing was left to unite the spirits of the citizens of the United States of America. \n\nTerror. \n\nAcross the South, hardline Yockeyites had swelled in number, as they continued to ravage the notions of a free and diverse society within the United States.

As the Far Right within the National Progressive Party, the former rivals for Harrington and all of the C-NPP, continued to die, a greater enemy seemed to take its place, a monster, no, an abomination. A beast of a man who sought to undo the hundreds of years of American history to raise Hell: Francis Parker Yockey. On the other hand, how could Harrington merely frame his dread around the South when the very supporters who chanted the name "Harrington" for the sake of progress now march the streets in a flood of red. The factory workers, the office writers, the hard-working American populace who had toiled for years at the behest of an unfair system attempting to strangle such poor souls out of their earnings, the ones who Harrington thought of and fought for within each and every day of his political career.

Head of a minor department within the Office of Education, he's come a long way from his days of organizing in the Jim Crow South.  But he hasn't abandoned his radical instincts, as a policy brief submitted today reveals.    It's a series of amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, boosting overall funding by nearly twenty percent, while adding a long set of funded activities.  Arts electives, black and Hispanic history courses, more funding for facility improvements, and more, are all on the list.  It would raise the already-substantial price tag of ESEA, but it would certainly please numerous teachers, students, and education activists across the country."

None of the union representatives are particularly intimidating at first glance, but all of them hold the keys to one of America's biggest structures of power: education.  At one point, Jacqueline Vaughn, a Chicago union delegate with kind eyes and a spine of iron, raised her coffee cup in a toast.  \n\n"To President Harrington.  We of the Chicago Teachers' Union have no permanent enemies, and no permanent friends, but you're coming very close to the latter, sir."\n\nSmiles, chuckles, a smattering of applause.  But she meant it.  Ever since the passage of ESEA, with its major new extensions of funding and support, it's become clear that the teachers' unions of America are firmly in the Harrington camp.  How to use them is another matter, but for now, it's good to have them on our own side."

And you would be wrong, as an open letter to the White House from NYC unionist Albert Shanker has demonstrated.  The letter thanked the Harrington administration for their "admirable work on behalf of the teachers and students of America", but went on to note a number of areas in which the administration could improve.  Improved facilities, more funding for the arts and cultural histories... it escaped nobody's attention that these policies were first laid out in the Brisben proposal.\n\nClearly, the unions are looking for more, but getting them on our side will be easier said than done.  It might anger some of the party's conservatives, who have already raised a fuss about where, exactly, the ESEA's funds are going.  But it might also mollify progressives and labor leaders who see the Shanker letter as an indicator of the administration's resolve.

It does make sense; the government doesn't charge kindergartners for the privilege of attending their neighborhood school, after all.  Numerous progressives are clamoring for this policy change, to ensure that college placements are based on merit alone, and that no student should have to worry about tuition fees at a state school.  But, by contrast, every fiscal conservative worth the title has come out of the woodwork to talk about how the additional funding would have to come from someplace else.

Filled with disgust, Harrington picked up the phone on his desk and pressed a number. "Please get Maurine and Orville in my office immediately." \n\nThe two secretaries walked in just a few minutes later, seeing their President with a heavy stack of papers sitting in front of him. "Good morning, Mr. President." said Maruine Neuberger. "Good morning, as well, Mr. President, may we be of some assistance?" an inquisitive Orville Freeman echoed behind her. "Good morning, to the both of you! Please, take a seat, we have much to discuss regarding this piece of legislation." \n\nThe next hour and a half consisted of arguments filled with yells that could be heard throughout the West Wing. \n\n"Neuberger, look at the statistics, hunger is up in America by 13% since the Akagi Accords, and that's not even considering Black citizens! This program has to be eligible for everyone, whether it's the workers, the mothers, or the veterans, all of them are starving out there!" Orville barked. "I understand, Orville, but our hands are tied for the most part. Our economy has been thrown for a loop for the longest time, and part of getting these hungry people food will have to be maintaining a stable economy, unless we seek to get rid of all of our food. All of them ought to be taken care of, but I'm not sure if we could afford to include everyone in the program, the destitute of course, but it's tough beyond that. President Harrington, I'm sure you understand?" \n\nHarrington took a deep look at both of his Secretaries.

With each line came another comment from one or the other, and with each paragraph came another argument. Until finally, the elephant in the room came crashing down on the desk between them; the targeting and focus of the Food Stamp Program. \n\n"President Harrington, with all due respect, we need this bill to go above and beyond what the United States history has done for the hungry in the past! Supermarkets are exploding around the country, and it's common logic that offering Food Stamps to be used in such huge markets will guarantee that the poor and hungry can get something to eat, they need this, Mr. President! Besides, we ran on a campaign of guaranteeing these people food, we'll be the laughing stock of the National Progressive Party if we don't commit to this!" Secretary Freeman hammered out. "And what about those markets, Orville, do you think they'll feel righteous in handing out their profits to the needy? Mr. President, I assure you, I want these people to be fed as much as any, but forcing the free market to go too far may result in them firing back and withdrawing any sort of support for our re-election or even the NPP as a whole!

It seeks to introduce a new system to aid the poor and hungry throughout the nation by allowing such citizens to obtain federally-given Food Stamps, which are to act as currency in the form of obtaining food. The President has reported that it took a "long, long time" to tweak the details and include everything that he and his administration desired to have in it. Harrington has claimed that "this Program is the foundation of a new era for American citizens, one in which mothers, fathers, veterans, and children will never have to fear with the looming question of 'Will I go hungry tonight, again?'" \n\nHaving said that, the Harrington administration has given its full backing behind the President. "President Harrington has spent countless hours with us examining the bill, it covers everything he wanted to and more, it's genius to say the least." Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture, commented. "We, in the Harrington administration, offer our full support for the President in his desire to pass the bill. We were selected by the President himself to be the finest minds to plan out the success of the poor and the average citizen alike." commented Maurice Neuberger, Treasurer. \n\nLikewise, the bill does not go without a number of critics in the public sphere as well, as numerous Congressman in the Republican-Democrat party, and even the Far Right branches of the National Progressive Party have voiced their concerns and even fears with allowing such meddling in the free market. Backing them up, several large supermarket chains have protested the bill, citing it as a "tyrannical restriction on our successes."

President Harrington, the main backer behind a wealth of welfare reforms in the United States, has regarded such guarantees as being centrally linked to a truly "free, fair, and just" human society, and has made ambitious steps forward in his pursuits for care for every American citizen, whether they be the average worker or the poor man left out on the street, whose situation may change with each passing vote tonight. \n\n Many within the administration collaborated with the President for the past few months in composing such legislation. Particularly, Orville Freeman, the Secretary of Agriculture who worked diligently with the program on other progressive reforms, comments, "Tonight, Congress will decide the fates of those lowly men, women, and children who lie on the streets, cold at night. Every unfortunate soul, scarred by the horrors of the Second World War, the plagues of economic difficulties, or otherwise, they will know if we, as a society, have learnt to care for such folk, or leave them in the dust as so many presidents have before." \n\nOnce more, however, not everyone is in favor of the President's actions; while some may call them "progressive," Republican-Democratic Congressman, as well as several of Harrinton's constituents in the National Progressive Party regard them as "simply radical." Even his own administration cites anxieties, as Secretary Neuberger raised several concerns, most likely in regard to the cost of the programs that President Harrington has worked on; however, she declined to comment tonight.

On the other hand, the US Chamber of Commerce has taken the lead in opposing the bill.  They have their own letter-writing campaigns, and much more imposing fundraisers.  The Chamber has been calling Medicare the first step on the road to tyranny, a waste of money, a handout, and plenty of other things besides.  The sizable tax burden that's been plastered across the editorial pages of half the country's newspapers hasn't helped the administration's case much.

"Campaign donors and other business owners are having a fit, executive employees are taking a hit on all phone lines." He continued, rushing towards another office. \n\n"Damn it all!"

If we sit on this we are just going to keep losing more support, should we go through with the full increase or not?" Secretary Neuberger was overwhelmed with the sudden demand of her, but managed to come together. "Well, Mr. President, I must admit that although it is quite the unpopular strategy, it would generate a substantial amount of income to come in for the Treasury. Furthermore, while I'm no campaign manager, people are sure to appreciate a Social Security net, and if taxes are to provide funds for it, then I would have to say that some would be appreciative at least." \n\nHarrington pinched the bridge of his nose to deal with the stress of it all. Neuberger was always one to provide legitimate facts, but he'd be damned to say that this would not come to make his next election a whole new pain in the ass. Having said that, maybe this is just what we need though, to rally those appreciative enough of it to his side to help with the Social Security program?"

Constant thoughts about his political readings, his viewings of the suffering of those in labor, and the uncaring of their superiors towards their difficulties. No kidding why so many are hungry out there, can't even get a break to eat, can they? Harrington dwelled on his thoughts, and finally sat down after the hour of time he had to battle with himself. Finally, he grabbed the phone, and punched in that ever familiar number. "Mr. President? It's eight in the evening, can I help you?" Secretary Neuberger replied over the phone. "Listen, it's about the Social Security bill. I think I finally want to add in the amendments to the Fair Labor act in it, could you come in?" Silence came in through the phone for a few moments. \n\nGive me half an hour to get there, Mr. President. \n\nThe President's Secretary came in through the Oval Office just a minute early. "You don't joke around with time, do you?" Harrington said. "Mr. President, I appreciate your humor, but this could completely change the situation. Adding those amendments could cause the business owners to lash out far worse than ever before, and we are already taking in deep crap from them, what makes you think giving them more hell is going to do for us?" With that, the Secretary's respectful disposition faded to the back, as Harrington thoughtfully nodded. "Madam Secretary, my senior communications advisors have instructed the danger in it, that the bill is already facing the threat of death without the amendments. But let's face facts, Mrs. Neuberger. Every day, those hard-working Americans that we are trying to look after up here are not getting any respect for the work they do, nor any way to move forward from their suffering.

Harrington has brought up the disastrous effects of economic recession before, and remarked that "the guarantee of a Social Safety economic network could provide unheard of success for the American citizen, and bring forth a new era of prosperity and care for the public sector, with workers and business owners alike being able to benefit from the program's successes." \n\nWith that in mind, many White House executives have exhaustedly doled out their support for the President's bold actions lately, in particular, Secretary Maurine Neuberger has offered extensive work in lessening fears regarding the bill. "Seeing President Harrington every day, I know that this piece of legislation is something that comes from deep within him. To see the success of American citizens without a cost to their freedom, time, or effort. He believes in the American Dream, and just knows that it takes a great amount of care and unity to see that we may prosper together." \n\nWhile Secretary Neuberger's words indeed spark emotion, the opposition cite a lack of any form of unity in the bill. Many of Harrington's critics, including several Democratic Senators, cite that such a program will bankrupt American reserves, while a wide range of far right Congressmen in the National Progressive Party see this as a "direct violation of American economic traditions." No one is quite sure as to the chance of success for President Harrington's bill, but emotions are high with everyone present."

harrington.93.desc:0 "Washington wasn't all that different from academia or the lecture circuit, President Harrington was discovering. Congress didn't lack for opinionated men and their pet theories and projects, even if Harrington thought they were dearly misguided. \n\n"Mr. President, even if everyone here's on board with your program, we're going to have to convince the people that we're on their side." Vice President Irving Howe said. "We get the people supportive of our reforms, the less opposition the R-D's will be able to put up." \n\nHarrington nodded. It wasn't rocket science - he'd promised America a presidency of the common man, and he would keep his promises. The only question was where to start. \n\n"What about the veterans?" Defense Secretary William Winter stated. "America has thousands of men who served in South Africa and in the Pacific. Nobody's going to object to us treating our heroes right." \n\n"A Home for Heroes." Nobody would question the need to repay America's soldiers for their service; the far right of the NPP would be ecstatic, and the R-Ds would be hard-pressed to say no. And if the veterans got a fair deal from the government, then the people might come around to being included eventually."

harrington.94.t:0 "The Veterans Service Act Goes to Congress"
harrington.94.desc:0 ""It's good. Send it through." \n\nHarrington looked up from his dog-eared copy of the proposed Veterans Service Act, giving his affirmation to the latest draft. Approval in hand, his army of aides scattered out of the Oval Office to carry the draft to Henry Jackson in the Senate and to other key lawmakers in Washington. \n\nOutside the White House, the night grew darker as the clock chimed midnight. Harrington rubbed his eyes, dry from the strain of reading through the draft. He'd taken a close look at every line - this first act, the one upon which everything else would follow, would be perfect. Senator Jackson would ensure that the rest of the draft would go through Congress, to take care of the rest. \n\nIt ought to be easy, Harrington thought. Everybody loved veterans, and the NPP could finally stick it to the R-Ds for not only being soft on the fascists, but ungrateful to its soldiers. Education subsidies for veterans, increased access to healthcare, disability payments to the injured - who in their right mind could oppose this? \n\nHarrington sighed. It'd been an exhausting night regardless, and it would only get harder from here."

harrington.95.t:0 "The Senate Votes for Veteran's Benefits!"
harrington.95.desc:0 "The news from the Senate floor was largely encouraging, if the floor speeches were any indication. As Defense Secretary Winter had pointed out, nobody was going to be so gauche as to criticize a bill to treat America's veterans well. The Center and the Far-Right of the NPP were broadly in support, and mounting a full-throated defense of the bill. The R-D's, for that matter, were speaking in broad platitudes about the bill's provisions, hailing the intent of the legislation. \n\nBut the details were a different question. Time and again, Democratic senators - and even a few Republicans - had asked about money. Money, money, always the money. Harrington had been in Washington long enough to understand that when people wanted to criticize you quietly, they would ask about the money - a fitting fig leaf to disguise a lack of concern for America's soldiers in the language of responsibility. \n\nThe debate wound on, and Harrington resisted the urge to call the Senate leadership for an update. Politics was a numbers game, of course, but they'd been careful to package everything in a way that couldn't be opposed on the merits. There'd been endless whip counts, fine-tuning of individual clauses, hypothetical debates. Harrington's NPP had left nothing to chance..."

harrington.96.desc:0 "Dear Mr. President,\n\nOn my first night working as a nurse, in 1961, a man pulled a knife on me.  I was working at Los Angeles County General Hospital, but they changed the name a few years back.  Anyway.  The man's name was John.  A cab driver had found him collapsed a few blocks away from the hospital.  A few minutes after we had brought him in and put him up in a bed, he pulled a switchblade and was holding it against my throat.  It turns out that he didn't have a cent to his name, and couldn't pay for services.  Guess he thought taking a hostage would help his situation somewhat.  We let him go, and I never saw John again.  The police shrugged it off, when they finally showed up.  Just another homeless wino, they said.  Would probably turn up dead in a week, they said.\n\nWhen I saw that Medicare had passed, I thought about John.  Working as a nurse, you see a lot of people's worries.  I saw John's that night.  And I hope that with this law, I never have to see that sort of worry again."

I am the oldest of eighteen children from Lewiston.  My father, Gerard, worked in a mill.  He beat me, and when I was eleven, I ran away from home.  For two years, I lived on the streets.  I worked in whatever job I could get.  Shining shoes.  Washing dishes.  I've slept in the back room at strip clubs and horse stables.  But I survived.  Eventually, I became the only person in my family to graduate high school.\n\nI wanted to go to college intensely.  But at Husson, the entrance test was in English, and I was terrible with it.  So I went to my state representative, Peter Snowe, and he helped convince the admissions people to let me take a test in French.  I passed, and they accepted me.  Now, I'm studying for a business degree.  I write for the school newspaper.  And thanks to the Higher Education Act, I don't have to worry about the cost.  I am working hard and making something of myself.  And you helped with that, Mr. President.  So, thank you."

My parents never spoke it around me, although my cousin works at a school in Zuni Pueblo that teaches it to little kids.  I hope to send mine there someday.  When I was growing up in Gallup, though, my parents didn't spend much time caring about school.  My father was a dishwasher, and my mother a hotel maid.  The highways were being built, and with them came travelers, tourists, all of those people.  It brought money and jobs, but nobody got rich.  Not even close.  My parents drank.  They never did drugs, but most of my friends had at least one parent who did.  We were all desperate.  Once I left home, I moved across town with the boy I'd met at Gallup High.  He ran off three years later, to work construction in Albequerque.  Left me with two toddlers and barely any way to make ends meet.  But when I could vote, Mr. President, I voted for you.  Your efforts have helped me get enough food on my table, and not get tossed out by my landlord.  I know a lot of folks around here who feel the same.  So, thank you, Mr. President.  You helped."

My grandma called you a dirty Red the first time she ever saw one of your advertisements.  She called you an atheist, and a bunch of other things.  But last year, her husband, my grandpa, passed away.  He had worked as a janitor at the Big Y headquarters for years and years.  Grandma had always been worried about keeping the house-she had been raised in it, you know-but now she gets his pension benefits and doesn't have to worry anymore.  I don't think that she'd ever admit it, but I know that I'm grateful.  So thank you, Mr. President.  I'm glad that you did what you did."

 harrington.201.t:0 "The Quiet Americans"
 harrington.201.desc:0 "President Harrington sometimes takes a walk along the grounds of the White House: in the first weeks of his term he made the bold move to begin walking around the D.C. Metropolitan Area's seedier districts, the streets that the Secret Service make sure to lock down every Presidential Address. He continues that tradition on an infrequent basis, when he can spare the time, greeting the lower-income constituents of the Beltway and treating them to a meal - he takes pains to remember all their names. Sometimes the name is all you have, he thinks. In any case, Harrington has little fear of blowback from these men and women: his policies have shifted the window on public discourse and treatment of the poor more than any other president in American history. Although he has savaged his Cabinet, nearly driven the Chambers insane and generally raised hell to do so, he has no regrets on the matter.\n\nTonight he takes a slightly different route, walking in another direction: same streets, different people. The lights dim, the streets narrow and fill with the casual refuse of American life, broken condoms and filled trash-bags. The other America is here, where the normal Americans aren't, and their response will tell him more about his success as a President than any pundit or analytical group. He walks into a cafe, its dull neon aesthetic glinting in the streetlights, and begins to probe. Is the government doing okay? Do you feel safe? Do your children feel safe? What do you think? "The fridges are still empty most days, the schools aren't working thanks to all the new fancy rules, the kids still walk to school afraid. But I hear it's worse in Mississippi. I hear it's worse in the Black Belt. I hear it's worse in Detroit. I hear the President's working to help but -"\n\nHarrington goes to bed that night and lies sleepless, even into the chill hours of the Potomac dawn. The cry of herons follows him, vast and boundless, into the gray morning light."

 harrington.202.desc:0 "The cracks in the NPP had been there for a long time, traceable to the moments of its inception. Simply put, the average National Progressive is a schizophrenic, his disparate personalities united only by a hatred of the Japanese threat. Many were willing to band around the cause of pushing the weak, spineless Republican-Democrats out of the White House. But the tension could only be ignored so long - and now it is beginning to splinter the very ground under which the President sits.\n\nAs Harrington's presidency becomes increasingly focused on its internal policymaking, and the cries of Big Government grow ever louder from the street-tops, the NPP is beginning to reconsider its loyalty to the man it has propelled to office. If a candidate refuses to toe to party line, bullying his party-members into submission and pushing an agenda that appears increasingly radical, well.. Loyalty can be defined, but it can also be redefined - created, but also withheld. The Rightists in the NPP led this charge, attempting to negotiate with Harrington to tone down his radical interventionist policy, but to no avail.\n\nIn a series of closed-door meetings the inevitable comes to pass. The Far Right-NPP moves across the proverbial floor, denouncing the Harrington Presidency as a nest of traitors, snakes and vipers dedicated only to turning America decadent, weak and prey for the foreign invaders. They are accompanied, alarmingly, by a pronouncement from a series of Baptist churches in the American South and West, declaring much the same thing: but this time they go further. For the first time in American civic history, a pastor declares the incumbent American President an Anti-Christ, dedicated to giving the American way of life over to the devil. This is an unpleasant surprise: it will not, however, be the last."
 harrington.202.a:0 "The Old Order screams as it is strangled."
 harrington.203.t:0 "Doubt In The Aisles, Fear In The Pews"
 harrington.203.desc:0 "The editorial is simple and damning: President Harrington is going too far. His policies are well-intentioned, no doubt - here the author pauses for dramatic effect, evaluating Harrington's personal history and his party's policies in an objective light - but are they really what is best for Americans at this point in time? Harrington's reformist sentiments extend not just to pension funds and social safety nets, but to education, to urban design, to the structure of the job, to a hundred other things that define the American way of life. How much can the apple tree be shaken for its fruits before the trunk tears itself apart in the tension? The author goes on to note that the worrying lack of progress on many of Harrington's Moral Battlefields, his areas of focus where the American poor are concerned, does not reflect a lack of effort on the Administration's part. The bureaucrats of the American government are simply trying to barricade policy they see as alienating and dangerous, not to mention tedious. They might even be right.\n\nThe sympathy the author exudes is possibly the most insulting thing about the article: it is clear that in other circumstances, the author might even have supported Harrington for his conviction and unshakeable belief in the need for a government with a heart. It is with profound sorrow that the author announces his doubt, so profound it acts as a final spit in the metaphorical coffin. He pronounces, with a magisterial and terribly condescending grace, that Harrington is 'the President we deserve, but perhaps not the President the nation needs right now.' Perhaps the editorial would not be so damning, nor its effect so profound, if it were not for the name attached to it: the editorial is written in the unmistakable style of, and signed off by, Lyndon B. Johnson, staunch Republican, cold-eyed reformist and (until today) the biggest ally Harrington has across the aisle policy-wise. If the Johnson is wavering, then Harrington's cross-aisle support is under threat as well: and another card is taken out of the already trembling house."

 harrington.204.t:0 "A Quiet Divorce Is Hardest To Bear"
 harrington.204.desc:0 "The parting of longtime partners is always bitter. Long-time enmity dissolves to wistfulness and sorrow, and the hopes undergirding that enmity are sublimed into a greater regret - it is said that things are most beautiful in retrospect, and perhaps the main engine driving that beauty is not the joy those things brought, but the sorrow of having to leave them behind. So it is in a quiet room in the locked doors of a hotel a few miles from D.C., as a long-time partnership dissolves - this partnership is not a matrimonial one, but it brings with it its own emotional baggage, and a fear of the future, that would not look out of place in any family court.\n\nThe Republican faction has officially renounced its support for Harrington's policy and by extension his administration: LBJ himself has spoken to the press about the mounting and eventually unbearable tensions the President has wrought on his nation through misguided and hasty policymaking. In a defiant shot back across the aisle, the President has in turn accused Lyndon of being the worst of allies, a moderate too enamoured of the vested interests he hides behind his back to support real change. The answer is clear: a break in public must be followed with a split in the alliance which once held Harrington's Congress together, and helped push through most of his policies.\n\nThe parting of longtime partners is always bitter, and tinged with sorrow: but the uncertainty is far more visceral than either of these. Harrington wonders, as he walks out of that hotel room into the bright day of the Beltway, what lies ahead for the country, and for himself. The ground trembles and quakes, but there is no time to stop. The programme, after all, must be finished - for Harrington has bright dreams for his country still, and the most dangerous visions are those that remain untarnished in the face of failure."

 harrington.205.t:0 "Crack The Heavens, Split The Seas"
 harrington.205.desc:0 "The Centre-NPP has always been an eclectic blend, to use the politically correct terminology. Progressivism is a potent motivator, but its unifying power has always been in doubt, and within the C-NPP there have always been strains of divergent thought about the extent and importance of the reforms officially proposed under their platform. Harrington's newfound aggressive stance is one that has shaken significant parts of this unstable base: talking about Social Security and reforms to labor security are quite different from what has been accomplished, what has been done and what remains on the table. There is talk of radicalism, of overreach - the Good Old Days are definitely gone, as are the smiles that accompanied it.\n\nBobby Kennedy sums it up best: in a speech given at Party Headquarters (publicised by media after the event in lurid fonts) he comments on "the devil we know, and how he turned out to be the devil we don't know so well after all". The reference doesn't even bother with explicitness, which in itself stands as a testimony to the splits occurring within the Progressive front. It's all out in the open now, and so when Harrington hits back with a demand for party unity and a call to "stay on course, lest we drift apart and then astray", no-one is surprised. Acrimony is the order of the day, after all, and just as with any breaking family, it might even be taken as a sign of affection.\n\nOne thing is certain: if things go on like this, well... the President is a strong man and no one can say he is a coward, but he is not a miracle worker. Lapsed Catholicism aside, no Savior will descend on fiery clouds to help him where even his own party has deserted him. Ironic, given the circumstances: Golgotha is far away - but for Michael Harrington, Good Friday is here."

Crack-crack-crack go the ceiling fans in a dozen meetings, called and cancelled for working groups that have dissolved into the fractal chaos of the C-NPP. Crack-crack-crack and the rooms are silent, save for the slow sizzle of burning stares and desperate notes, written in the knowledge they might already be irrelevant. Crack-crack-crack and the President walks into hushed Cabinet meetings where the Party is mentioned less and less, and Our Men mentioned more and more. Nobody smiles, few greet the President, many outright argue with him. After the anguish there is silence, and the fans, and the silent face of the black night outside.\n\nCrack-crack-crack go the ceiling fans, and with every whir a Party dies. The Rightists are long gone, the Republicans have left, the Progressives have crumbled, the radicals are increasingly silent (although a Representative Yockey and his followers are vocal in their agitation). Slow amputation, but an amputation nonetheless.\n\nThe Republican-Democrats can only watch in awe as their biggest rival for the hearts of the American people calves and splinters from within, unsure whether to mourn or celebrate. The cliques are forming, along lines carefully predetermined by alignment on policy platforms and collaboration: the only thing they can think to agree on is that none of them will ever work with Harrington's Men Of The People (or Yes-Men, to use the derogatory term) again. The C-NPP is a party in name and in physical presence, but the facade is all there is now. Everything else burns as the President watches a government torn asunder. And there is no end in sight."

The Overton Window has at least shifted sufficiently for the Left-NPP to begin filling in the cracks (and there are more cracks every week) in the President's circle of Advisors, to compensate for the crumbling Progressive base that Harrington relies on. Chavez himself has begun to take on an increasingly accommodating position, speaking up for the use of Presidential executive orders where legislative means prove non-viable (and since President Harrington doesn't control Congress, the former is looking like an increasingly appeal long option).\n\nCertainly there are very few cynics left in the Cabinet, and even fewer remain in the President's graces: in what appears to be a reactive fit of paranoia the President has even begun expelling those he seems unfit for the Party and an enemy of his agenda from his personal space (although he really doesn't control much beyond his personal desk anymore). Those who are left are forced to withstand an environment of constant stress and fatigue. Too much work, too few hands, and the cameras and paparazzi grow louder every day, their chorus more insistent.\n\nAfter a 25-hour board meeting titled Resolution To Current Affairs (Legislative Means And Procedures), Harrington reportedly collapses from stress and overwork at a conference reviewing the continuing failures of Education Reform in the Southern states. The press are ushered out, but the photos of the President lying supine on the desk hit a nation's vital signs like a brick. Something is wrong with the United States of America..."

(Last week the papers published a photo of a Guardsman wrestling with a protestor: it was bad optics for all, and if the Molotov cocktail in the protestor's hand had been dropped...)\n\nThe hooded figure making his way down the alley gazes at the signs, the paint still drying in bright flecks and stripes: HARRINGTON GET OUT! COMMUNISM NOT WELCOME HERE! WHO PAYS FOR US? The crowds holding it aloft are not Bankers or corporate suits, of course. No, these crowds are the middle and lower classes: from the West Coast drawls and the New England polish he hears in the babble, some of them have come quite a long way. He listens attentively, asking questions: here at the end of all things he can at least ask for clarity.\n\nThe poor speak to him as they never have before. Collapsed companies, drying-out towns and burnt-out Teachers, slowly slumping local economies. Reforms to education impacting thousands of students, some of them poor, some of them their families' last hopes. Broken homes that only receive a perfunctory brush with federal welfare, and are left to rot. Whispers of the President's inaction towards certain parts of the civil rights movement - is he a bigot? And regret, regret for President Harrington and for the nation he dragged into the furnace of good intentions, endless regret and the scent of lost futures.\n\nAll these come out into the open, and revelation brings its own senseless and ineffable calm.

My position gives power, but it also bestows vision. I see the tired young mother, struggling at her workplace against the invisible sexism that chokes her career and her family; I see the tired old farmer, yoked to the agriculture companies that rob him of his due share. I see the fearful young Negro walking on the city streets, knowing his every breath is a threat to those who would seek his harm. Their struggle to live, work and play is my struggle as well, and I will make it our struggle; for if the other America dies a quiet death just off the television screen, I, your President, will have failed at leading this one. And the struggle that defines these forgotten ones is not just one of poverty, but of culture, soul and spirit; therefore it will be my task, and my privilege, to bring true and lasting reform to the system which shackles with crime, unemployment, despair and low health.

Indeed, if the child were to recommend that we leave him at the roadside to live or die, any parent would rebuke him! The desire to protect the commonweal is ingrained in the nature of man itself. Yet because our country's business halls and public offices deem poverty a sin and helplessness an untreatable illness, we have all become hypocrites! We rob the beggar of his right to healthcare and safety, the mental patient of his right to equal and proper treatment, and the criminal of his right to redemption and restoration to the world.\n\n"My question, friends, is this: when your children grow old enough to see you as an equal, to know your accomplishments for what they are, will they call you a hypocrite too? Someone who knew his duty to his fellow man, but spurned it because he was weak, afraid, or simply had too much to lose?...And that terrible title of hypocrite; will you deserve it?"

He had requested such modifications be made, but it never truly sunk in that the office was his now. With his head so far into the clouds, the President hardly heard the knock at the door he should have been expecting. "Come in," he said, snapping out of his trance.\nIn walked an older, slender man with deeply greyed dark hair. Harrington had been expecting Glen H. Taylor, having called him only a few days ago, and now he had finally arrived. "Mister President," he said, sitting down across from Harrington, "I understand from your call that you're looking for me as a cabinet member?"\n"That's right, Taylor. A President needs a cabinet, and I've dallied for too long on the formation of mine. I want you to be my Secretary of State."\nTaylor looked taken aback. "Really? You want me to be your Secretary of State? I just don't know; I was a politician for only a few years back in the '50s, and now I'm just a middling activist and businessman. Why me?"\n"During your tenure as a Senator, you put up some of the most fierce opposition to the far right that I've ever seen. You're determined, hardworking, and educated. I need people like that in this administration. I need people like you."\nTaylor sighed, rubbing his chin in contemplation.

Would like anything? Coffee? I've got some freshly brewed."\nHe needn't have said anything about the coffee; Harrington could smell the roasted, bitter flavor from just outside the door. He must have made it in anticipation. A thank-you, most likely, for choosing him. She was on to him; he had never said anything about a cabinet position over the phone. "I'd like a cup, yes," he finally said, "with sugar, but no cream."\nShe obliged him, returning with a delightfully sweet but decidedly dark cup of liquid. "It's very clear to me that you know why I'm here," said Harrington.\n"Indeed," she replied, "so, what position do you want me for?"\n"Secretary of the Treasury."\nNeuberger raised an eyebrow. "Treasury? Well, I suppose that is what I would be most qualified for."\n"You're intelligent, respected, and you won't back down a fight with Wall Street or any other business interests because yours don't align with theirs. We'll need someone like that for the war on poverty. I think you're quite well suited."\n"Well," she said, "I suppose my answer ought to be 'yes'.""

That can't give away much about my intentions, right?"\n"Respectfully, sir, a Lieutenant Governor does not typically engage in meetings with the President of the United States. If you wanted to see me in person, it would be for something important. So, what do you want me for?"\n"Secretary of Defense."\nWithout missing a beat, Winter replied, "Of course, I accept. I figured that's why you were here so I've had some time to mull it over in my head, but, tell me, why not someone more experienced? I only reached Lieutenant Colonel, and even then I never saw much combat."\n"True, but you got that rank for something. Plus, you won Lieutenant Governor as a progressive Democrat in the most southern, hard conservative state that there is. You're a leader; you inspire people. That's got to count for something.""

While stressing that the ultimate decision rests with the President, senior NPP figures emphasized that 'all options remain on the table.' \n\nMembers of the Republican-Democratic Party have expressed skepticism towards the President's confrontational foreign policy, viewing the endeavor as naive adventurism.

We have to fortify and invest in the OFN, an unbreakable rock for the Japanese to break themselves upon."\n\nThe Director of the CIA sighed.

The legacy of President Joseph Kennedy's failure to build up America's military continues to haunt the Pentagon; proponents of this plan argue that the buildup of military equipment needed to support a future war must start today, even at the expense of other industrial or economic priorities. They warn that ultimately, America will go to war with the military it has, rather than the military it wants. \n\nThe Secretary of Commerce takes a different tack, arguing that fostering the growth of America's civilian industrial base would yield accelerating dividends in the longer-run. The wholesale diversion of American industry into military production, they argue, would be monstrously inefficient and create a hypermilitarized economy like that of Germany or Japan, a nation of free men enslaved to their guns.

In addition many of the former Dixiecrats in the party are openly sympathetic to isolationist stances and only pay lip service to containing Japan. We now have a difficult choice ahead; promptly reinstating the draft and enact war preparation measures to ensure our nation is protected against the many foreign threats and ready to act swiftly like a pouncing eagle, or to try to gradually build support for these things through a fierce media campaign while optimizing our industry for wartime production.

USA_Together_Forever_desc:0 "The 25th anniversary of the OFN is coming up soon. We should make this a grand occasion with a joint military parade in DC, celebrations in each member country and televised speeches from each head of state. It is important, in these dark times, that people around the world are reminded that the Torch of Liberty still burns bright in the New World and that the bonds of men cannot be broken by the bootheels of tyrants! We have fought them for a quarter century and we'll fight them for a century more if we have to."

USA_Canada_desc:0 "Our friends to the north are our most important allies after the fall of Europe. Bound by a common language, culture, and origin, we stand proudly together in defense of the ideals once born from the Magna Carta in ages gone by. Sadly their economy has struggled without the old Commonwealth trade. As their most important trade partner, we should help them out with cross-border investments and discounted trade deals, that should get the old lion roaring again."
USA_Guyana:0 "Our New Friend"
USA_Guyana_desc:0 "A young lady from Guyana was recently brought to the White House by her brother, a staffer at the Guyanese embassy. Tearfully, she explained that the difficult economic conditions in her home country had driven her town to the verge of starvation, and how countless settlements like hers are almost cut off from the coastal cities due to bandits and wild animals stalking the roads. This could make for good optics, given our past... issues with Guyana. Let us issue an official statement about how touched we were by the story and promise a nice fat foreign aid package for the Guyanese government, to be invested into integrating the countryside into the modern industrial economy. That should win us some hearts and minds."
USA_New_Zealand:0 "Our Old Ally"
USA_New_Zealand_desc:0 "New Zealand is small and isolated, and following the loss of her mother country, isolated besides from Australia and the US. Let us remind them that we will never forget their sacrifices during the last war and their importance in the conflicts to come.

We're sadly far from that world, but we can still feel pride in the alliance we have created. In twenty years we have turned a loose coalition of traumatized survivors of the world war, mostly former colonies cut off from their homeland, and turned it into a true alliance of freedom fighters, mobilized and ready to fight tyranny wherever it may encroach upon our shores. Let us take a step back and review our proud past before thinking about where we will take the OFN in the future."

So, for the moment, we should endeavor to destabilize the Sphere to distract the Japanese, weaken their economy and tie them up in foreign conflicts. The CIA recommends targeting the "soft underbelly of the Sphere," the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia. All of these nations have strong resistance movements and difficult terrain that makes them perfect for prolonged guerilla warfare to tie down and weaken the Japanese. Let us make contact with them."
USA_Set_Up_The_Networks:0 "Set Up The Networks"
USA_Set_Up_The_Networks_desc:0 "Our initial contact with the resistance movements have been promising, but we will need an extensive network of spies and informants to keep tabs on the true strength and positioning of both our enemies and our allies.

USA_Preemptive_Sabotage_dsec:0 "The Japanese are onto many of our resistance friends. To limit their movement in the region and hinder them redeploying their forces to effectively counter the coming operations, commando teams must be sent in to quickly sabotage infrastructure where the Resistance don't have the manpower or equipment to do it themselves. The Japanese should be severely slow to respond to any crisis, not to mention short on supplies. This will buy us some breathing space and allow the endangered resistance friends to reposition themselves."
USA_Meet_The_Resistance:0 "Meet The Resistance"
USA_Meet_The_Resistance_desc:0 "The Filipino Resistance initially refused our cooperation, unlike the movements in other countries. For some movements it was a simple matter of not being informed of our attempts to contact them, either through isolation from other groups or because they do not trust foreigners. However, for many others we appeared as cowards who abandoned them to Japan at best, and as little better than the Japanese at worst. Many of the older fighters fought against our own troops once upon a time, and though only the most ancient of the members remember the Spanish, many of the Filipinos saw our actions during and after that war as naked imperialist aggression. Luckily, our effectiveness in sabotaging the Japanese and the enthusiasm of the other resistance movements in the regions have convinced the larger Filipino resistance groups to finally meet with us and discuss how we can help them in liberating their country. We better prepare. "

USA_Train_The_Militias_desc:0 "Before the Germans invaded them, the British were highly successful at training select European resistance fighters into fierce commandos, who could then be parachuted back into their homelands to direct the most dangerous sabotage missions and help train the regular partisans back home into a true threat to the Germans. Some of these British-trained networks, like Milorg in Norway and the Home Army in Poland, still fight on today, twenty years later. Let us emulate this success by bringing key Asian resistance figures stateside for intensive training, so they can return to their home countries with knowledge of the most modern drill, combat and sabotage training procedures available in the greatest country in the world. Before long their ragtag militias will be hardened partisans who won't stop killing Japanese until the last sakura is burned to ash!"

For the moment they are scrambling their garrisons to protect critical areas like Java and south Vietnam, this leaves us a nice opening in the Philippines to further impress our new Resistance friends. Operation MacArthur will see another wave of sabotage actions, this time concentrated in the Philippine archipelago. The zaibatsus have as expected pulled their strings in Tokyo to have the Japanese garrisons protect their factories, meaning the factories of the collaborationist regime are now more exposed than a naked Japanese man at the NPP national convention! Time to teach them the price of treason."
USA_Contact_The_Holdouts:0 "Contact The Holdouts"
USA_Contact_The_Holdouts_dsec:0 "An unexpected development in the Philippines, as the CIA have received information from several Resistance groups that elements of the old government still survive in the jungles of Mindanao. While key government officials like the President were evacuated to Australia during the collapse of our army there at the start of the war, many more junior ministers and civil servants of the Commonwealth remained trapped in Luzon. Many of them were released or outright ignored by the Japanese during the war, but in the wake of the Akagi Accords, many of them disappeared, which we thought was due to a purge by the Laurel administration. However, now it seems that dozens of them were warned of the incoming purge and were evacuated by the Luzon-based Hunters ROTC guerilla group to rural Mindanao. On the basis of the former cadets of the Hunters and surviving Army remnants, they formed the Provisional Government of the Army of Mindanao (PGAM). If we can reconnect them with the old exile government in DC, we have a real shot at restoring a legitimate alternative to the collaborationist regime! Their territory is tiny and their fighters fewer than four digits, but combining their small sliver of freedom with the legitimacy of the old regime will prove a powerful symbol. The rest of the Resistance may be less happy at us trying to revive the old regime, though."

They might even have a realistic chance at toppling the government and free the country. Until now our contact has primarily been with the larger groups on Java and Borneo, but perhaps we can make contacts with these smaller groups on the other islands too. If we can help forge a unified front against the Japanese, we could launch a devastating blow against the Sphere."

However, using the remote villages of the PGAM as a nighttime drop site for crates full of weapons and plastic explosives, we can ensure the gear is easily smuggled in backpacks, cars and fishing boats to all of the Philippines and Eastern Indonesia in significant quantities. We can also contact our friends in Vietnam to see if a similar solution can be found at the other end of the region. Soon, our friends can sabotage and attack as often as they want!"

Our early overtures towards them were met with great interest, as they see the NPP as fellow travelers in the journey towards a more equal and free society. It is time to contact them again and express our desire for a broadened and active relationship."

Giving the Viet Minh intelligence about the government's troop movements and soft targets, they can show their incompetence at maintaining a unified and secure state for their citizens.

We have set Asia aflame, and the Japanese, impoverished by their kleptocratic economy and sluggishly reacting under their corrupt and bloated imperial administration, are struggling to bring their enslaved "allies" back into the fold. Slowly, but surely, the simmering tensions and resentments in the Sphere are coming to a boil, and formerly cowed groups in China, Siam, Korea and the Pacific are smelling blood in the water. The match we threw helped ignite the explosion of violence against injustice in Indonesia, and now we can sense something big on the horizon, the true end of the hegemony of the setting Sun. It may take us years or even decades to get there, but America will not rest until the Japanese clutch is broken and Asia is free for the first time since the colonial era began. The bells of liberty will ring out from Singapore to Peking! For America! For Freedom!"

bobby.100.desc:0 "The ride to Arlington National Cemetery had become a familiar one to Robert Kennedy. He knew every bump, every stop, every turn on the roads that led him to the place where he had celebrated his greatest triumphs and dealt with his most devastating defeats. As the guards gave their familiar salute towards the presidential convoy going into the complex, he remained lost in thought, desperately trying to push away what he had come here to do and instead focus on the memories he had made there before. Like that night Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, after having to move heaven and earth to finally deliver the promises of America to so many, and had fallen asleep beside him open bottle of champagne in hand.\n\nThose feelings of warmth were the only thing that powered him to get out of the car and walk over to the calling flame, but even they couldn't defeat the sense of finality that washed over him as he stopped and finally looked towards where his brother rested. All he could do was simply stare and shiver as the memories of fortitude were replaced by ones involving Jack, long pushed down by both repression and the strains of governance. The ferociousness of Hyannis touch football, the giddiness of him winning the VP nomination, the glow of undying loyalty as his Chief of Staff... He wasn't his charismatic, secure self anymore, and with all his remaining strength he took the note he had held in his clenched fist and laid it down next to the dancing flame. He stared at it, as the feelings of utmost anger, sadness, and loss died down inside of him, before abruptly walking back to the limo. Not a word was uttered by the Secret Service as he grasped onto Ethel, as memories of old faded away and the realization that he had finally made his family's legacy whole set in. After years of fighting, scraping, and clawing, he had secured what his brother had died for, what he had fought for every single day since that horrible moment. Tears poured down his cheeks as the limousine drew away, and he said goodbye to Arlington for the last time.\n\nDusk fell. An elderly groundskeeper shuffled between the rows of headstones, tidying them, making sure they would look perfect to the families who would come through those gates in the morning. Checking on the Eternal Flame, he saw a piece of paper. He picked it up, unfolded it, and pondered the words of a grieving brother's soul finally at peace."
