 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC:0 "In so many ways, Mikhail Alexeevich Matkovsky displayed a form of Russian fascism that contrasts itself against Rodzaevsky's formulation. Where Rodzaevsky was dogmatic, he was pragmatic. Where Rodzaevsky was a skilled, fiery orator, he was the negotiator, using his tact and political acumen to sway political enemies to his side. Where Rodzaevsky praised the anti-Semitic initiatives from the Blackshirts, Matkovsky despised their thuggery. For a brief moment, their goals aligned. The results of their cooperation saw the membership RFP rise and peak, as more and more Russian émigrés saw the appeal of fascism.\n\nThen the Great Patriotic War erupted. With the Germans waging a conflict of extermination upon Russia, the differences between these two simmered. Despite Hitler's destructive, genocidal intent, Rodzaevsky sought his support, dreaming of a Russia free from Bolshevism at last. Matkovsky had no such illusions. Germany's war against the Soviet Union, and therefore against Russia, lay bare their racial hatred against Russians. No matter what appeal the RFP can garner, the Nazis did not factor any independent Russia into their plans. However, true to Matkovsky's tact, he and his clique remained silent and bided their time, growing their power in the intervening years.\n\nWhen the time came, they seized the city of Magadan from Rodzaevsky, driving the loyalists out and officially splitting the party. Now in charge of his own domain, Matkovsky seeks to save Russia from her ruin. The means to this end lay across the ocean, past the Japanese: America. However, even for an experienced negotiator such as Matkovsky, convincing any foreign power is a difficult task; yet, he will not let mere doubt stop him."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_PETLIN_DESC:0 "Unlike the other senior figures in the Russian Fascist Party, Nikolay Nikolayevich Petlin was a native of Harbin, not an emigre. At first, this difference only seemed to be at surface level. Working as a playwright, composer, and writer in Harbin, Petlin joined the Russian Fascist Party and was noted for his talents as a political organizer. Soon, he became the leader of the Fascist youth organization, before finally landing himself a spot in Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Supreme Council, a timid man surrounded by the personalities of Matkovsky and Rodzaevsky.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded Russia, Petlin condemned Rodzaevsky's support of the Nazis' invasion, resigning in protest. From then on, he drifted to Matkovsky's wing of the RFP, serving as his personal secretary - an arrangement that survived until Matkovsky's act to separate his wing of the party from Rodzaevsky. Petlin found himself rising again, and the former Vozhd of the Russians appointed him as his deputy when the schism occured. Under Petlin, the RFP pursued an agenda of courting the United States by promising reform, a promise that Matkovsky had subverted again and again.\n\nPetlin was there when the Russian Fascist Party became the Russian National Labor Party. He was there when they conquered Siberia, and paraded through the cities of Tomsk and Novosibirsk. He was there for Matkovsky's resignation and arrest over the crimes of the Dalstroy. This time, Petlin swears, he will be there when democracy returns to Russia, under the leadership of the emigres. His destiny shall be the redemption of Harbin."

 MAG_fascist_splitters_desc:0 "Long ago, the Russian Fascist Party was a united organization, free from the civil strife that plagues everything in Russia. However, this unity did not last long. The doctrinal differences that divided its two heads, Konstantin Rodzaevsky and Mikhail Matkovsky, had simmered for years, perhaps for decades. It finally came into a head when Matkovsky seized the port town of Magadan for his own use. He promises a free Russia, an unshackled Russia, a Russia liberated from the chains of suffering and poverty. Only time will tell if his promise holds."

They are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nShould one of the main wings manage to solidify power, the future of the §YSiberian National Republic§! will be theirs to shape...\n\nCurrently [ROOT.GetMAG_reformists_vs_labourists] faction is the most influential.\n"

 MAG_the_true_heir_of_harbin:0 "The True Heir of Harbin"
 MAG_the_true_heir_of_harbin_desc:0 "The Russian Fascist Party, as it was known in Harbin, is now gone. Long displeased with Rodzaevsky's policies and rhetoric, Matkovsky and his wing of the party has taken control of Magadan and are now molding it to suit their purposes. No longer shall the party struggle in mud, while the whole of Russia suffers. No more thuggery, no more rhetorics of hatred; Mother Russia calls us to her fold, to rescue her from ruin.\n\nBefore Matkovsky can do his duty for his motherland, however, he must rule alone, without either constraint nor disloyalty. While he trusts his wing of the party, he must crush dissent among his ranks. All those suspected of loyalty to Rodzaevsky shall find themselves purged. With his political hold over Magadan secure, Matkovsky shall do his sacred duty, one that he has steeled himself to do ever since the heady days of Harbin: under his guidance, Russia shall stand again, sole, strong, unrivaled."

 MAG_building_the_wastes:0 "Building the Wastes"
 MAG_building_the_wastes_desc:0 "News of horror drifts from the west. German terror bombings, bandit raids, and wars fought by Russians against Russians: in the edges of Far Eastern Russia, Magadan is remote and sheltered from the troubles that plague the rest of the Motherland. Due to its distance, however, Magadan is not much. Located in the sparsest region in Russia, both in population and resources, there is not much here that is of use for the eventual liberation and reunion of Russia.\n\nMatkovsky will change that. The officials of his party shall travel the streets and outskirts of Magadan, for workers willing to join him in his crusade. They will build roads and telegram poles, small workshops, and manufactories. When the day of liberation dawns upon the dark body of Russia laid to rest by failures of the Reds and the crimes of the Germans, they shall find themselves richly rewarded by their duty and dedication, for Matkovsky shall let no faith in him go to waste."

 MAG_siberian_factories:0 "Siberian Factories"
 MAG_siberian_factories_desc:0 "Magadan, as has been noted before, is remote and isolated from the rest of Russia. In the port town of Magadan itself, the industry that exists is small and not particularly tailored to the production of war materiel. Fortunately, in the Far East, this lack of industry persists everywhere, as the industrial center of Vladivostok, developed in the times of the Reds, is now lost to the Japanese and Manchurians. To put it briefly, all who we fight in the East are on a level playing ground.\n\nNo opportunity passes Matkovsky by so smoothly, however. From the wastes of Siberia, he shall craft factories, with the express intent of waging war, not small-time conflicts between children. The party shall arm and train the soldiers of Magadan as soldiers, not bandits possessing a higher ideal. Conversely, no citizen belonging under the wings of the party shall know poverty or lack; let this be an example, a vision of Russia to come."

 MAG_siberian_farms:0 "Siberian Farms"
 MAG_siberian_farms_desc:0 "As a famous Chinese strategist once said, "an army marches not on its feet, but its stomach." The port town of Magadan has always relied on outside imports during the time of the accursed Union and Empire to sustain its need for food. Deprived of connections to other regions of the motherland, most of its inhabitants have turned to coastal fishing to make do in the meantime.

In the meantime, there is the matter of the armed forces of the party. Though capable and relatively well-armed, our men are not suited or used to fighting in the Siberian lands.\n\nIt's time to try something else.

Their large numbers also mean that they can exploit the gaps within our lines effectively, isolating active combat units and swamping them with a relentless assault of bodies.\n\nWe need to fight smarter. Our troops are superior, but we need to find a new way to use them. We shall not give ground to them anymore. We shall study their patterns of attack and their weaknesses.

We shall turn our broadcasts in the direction of the tribes while distributing free radios among the populace.

Little do the peasants know, however, that their beloved Father, formerly of their parish, is still alive.\n\nThe Vozhd must decide what to do with him. Letting him loose into Siberia may once again result in the peasants rising and rebelling against or stranglehold in the Far East. For this predicament, we shall excommunicate him and damn his memory forever. There was never a Father; it was a disorganized rebellion who rose against Matkovsky's rightful rule over the Far East.

No one stands to challenge the might of the RFP and its Vozhd. However, there is still something to do.\n\nTo reassure the peoples of Siberia and the west of our intentions, as well as to curry favor with the Americans, our Vozhd has come up with a grand, almost-liberal seeming notion: the Charter of Magadan. We will outline and implement the rights we promised years ago in the Siberian Bill of Rights. All people of the Far East can rest easy, knowing that the RFP shields and guarantees their rights. This is only a taste of what's to come for the rest of Russia."

 MAG.1.t:0 "The Last of the True"
 MAG.1.desc:0 "Matkovsky steadied his glasses against his nose, peering down at a piece of paper with rows and rows of names written all over it. A list of Rodzaevsky's suspected loyalists. He looked up to discover a room packed to the brim with books from his White Army days, old decaying American newspapers, and in the far corner, shrouded in the dark, an old gramophone gathering rust and dust. The sight of the thing brought a smirk to Matkovsky's face: the old Harbin building, the dances and the parties, and above all of it, the electric swastika, promising another future for the Russians stranded there.\n\nThe doorbell rang, shaking Matkovsky off his reverie. Two gruff men, dressed in the Party uniform, enter. In his small and messy room, they stood out as an oddity, almost barbaric even. Their feet thumped loudly on the wooden floors as they attempted a clumsy salute. One lean, with breezes of blonde hair peeking beneath the party cap. The other stocky, with the bulge of his stomach plain to the eye.\n\nAfter a few moments of awkward silence, Matkovsky stared at them, before finally saying, "Well?" With trembling voice, they gave him the names of the people who they had purged today. Matkovsky gave them a generous smile. "Thank you. You may now leave." When he heard the doorknob latch itself closed, he turned again to his list. Sergei A., Bruno B., Nikolas C. He crossed them out, dabbing the names in thick black ink, snuffing them out forever from the history of the Russian Fascist Party. Balancing his glass of whiskey in his hands, Matkovsky looked at his reflection against the murky liquid before taking a sip.\n\nThe hours went by. The doorbell rang, and the men came and did their salutes, telling him of the names disappearing from the list. Sometimes, when the wind was right, he could hear the crack of rifle fire, somewhere deep in the woods. It was nighttime by the time he finished the list. He gently pushed the men out, thanking them for a job well done. After they left, he bolted the door behind them. Turning to his gramophone, he decided that he would dance to the memories of Harbin. He turned it on and let the good times roll."

 MAG.2.desc:0 "The broadcast started wrong. Before the talk show began, the Magadan Free Radio played a sequence of songs plagued by crackling audio. The inexperienced crews of the MFR, fascists unused to any other work than thuggery, had mixed the sound with too much bass and mistakenly placed the treble dial.\n\nThe audio cuts. A thump. Two thumps. "Is this thing on?" a coarse voice said, his lips smacking too close against the microphone, "Oh, it is!"\n\nAnother voice, smooth baritone, said from a far corner of the room, "We're live, what the hell are you saying?" Trembling on the table, as the voice closed in. Three taps on the table. "Follow the script." An awkward pause. "Did you forget to disconnect the microphone? Did you?" A sigh. "This is such a fucking disaster." An electric discharge sounded as the mic was unplugged. The badly mastered songs continued, rattling the night of the first broadcast of the MFR.\n\nThe audio cuts out, again. The coarse voice returned, still a little too close to the mic, "Hello, fellow Russians in the Far East. Welcome to the very first broadcast of Magadan Free Radio." Lip-smacking. "My name is Sergei, I'm the host of the radio tonight, alongside with my friend, Vasi..." Sergei's voice trailed off. A few moments later, he shouted into the mic, likely blowing off a few eardrums, "Vasily!"\n\nVasily took his seat, audibly. With a little sigh, he began, "Yes, with my friend Sergei here, we shall accompany you through many, many cold Siberian nights in the future." An affected cheer. "For now, we'd like to thank Mr. Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the RFP, for sponsoring this program." An awkward silence, as the clocks ticked in the background. "For now, let's proceed with the music."\n\nJust before the audio turned on again, the smooth baritone said, "What the fuck is wrong with yo-""

 MAG.3.t:0 "The Pretender"
 MAG.3.desc:0 ""To the Honorable Claimant to the Throne of Russia," the letter read so far, "we have come to beseech you for your aid against our mutual enemy, the traitor Konstantin Rodzaevsky." No, the letter ought not to be so direct. Putting down his pen, Matkovsky laid his hand across his face and sighed. Leaning forearm against his table and propping his head against his open palm, he stared at the page, its paragraphs waiting to be filled out. His tea sat right below him, its smell tempting him. Matkovsky tapped his feet. He has no time for that now.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, Matkovsky found himself adjusting his glasses, his fingers rapping the table in sequence. A thousand questions swarmed his mind. What if the Tsarists reject the treaty? What if they find the terms unacceptable? He shuddered to think of what would happen if both sides did not cooperate against Rodzaevsky. Someone knocked on the door. Rather than answering, Matkovsky's index finger mimicked its rhythms on his table.\n\nHe clapped his hands. Standing from his seat, he said aloud, "The letter is not ready yet. Go away." The knockings stopped. He looked at the letter. Clapping his hands together and drawing a deep breath, he sat down, toying with the pen as he thought of words to say to Mikhail.\n\n"We appeal in the name of our old friendship," he scribbled without much thought, "in the Anti-Bolshevik Front. As we all know..." He found his hands picking up speed. Before long, he would stand and say:"

 MAG.4.t:0 "Saboteurs Strike!"
 MAG.4.desc:0 "There is an alarming trend growing on our borders. The traitors in Magadan seem to have struck a deal with the Tsarists in Chita. A temporary truce? An alliance, even? The minds of Mikhail and Matkovsky are foggy and unclear as ever.\n\nThis morning, our forward observers have found our border guards dead, and their weapons missing. This incident is hardly isolated. The intensifying raids coming from both sides of the border, as well as the destruction of valuable remnants of Union roads and rail, have become more and more frequent. Our forces are stretched thin, barely enough to cover one side of the front. When the tsarists attack, the traitors join them, forcing us to expend our resources in two directions. We inevitably lose some in the process: whether it is men, weapons, or plain loot.\n\nRodzaevsky sits in his office, pondering what to do next. This pact has marked a turning point in the relationship between the three components of the Anti-Bolshevik Front. One can only wonder what fate awaits them next. Will the tsarists and the traitors win against the divinely-sanctioned Vozhd of Russia or truth triumph against treachery? Only time will tell."

 MAG.5.t:0 "The Man in the White House"
 MAG.5.desc:0 "Nikolai Petlin adjusted his tie. A mental tick, something he learned a long time ago in the RFP. Looking over his desk, he ruminated on the task Matkovsky had assigned to him. A typewriter, surrounded by rolls and rolls of ink, practically a luxury. Petlin cannot imagine writing those letters and appeals by hand. He had spent long hours in this office, and his fingers twitched as he prepared himself to type again. His assistants could only do so much; none spoke English, and to ask Matkovsky for aid would overstep propriety.\n\nHe sighed. He remembered the words Matkovsky told him. "Convince the man in the White House," his master had said, staring into Petlin's eyes without flinching, "That is all." Matkovsky did not like being taken lightly. At the best of times, Petlin could see the old Harbin spirit in him, a spirit of hope, of kindling, of a prayer for a new home. The winter had extracted its toll upon the man, and the gaunt, flushed cheeks were but symptoms of the payment.\n\nHe looked beneath his desk. Stacks upon stacks of paper, numbering almost in the thousands. Soon, upon the completion of his task, these would be sent to America, finding themselves in the mailboxes of Senators, Representatives, Russian émigrés, and other assorted people who are receptive to Matkovsky's project. On top of the furthest stack, lay a folder, bound in manilla yellow. Plastered to the front of it was, "The Siberian Bill of Rights." Petlin's personal ideas to solicit more aid, or at least sympathy from Americans. He wondered if Matkovsky knew what his real sympathies were.\n\nHe shook his head. Now was not the time for the mind to wander. He laid his fingers upon the keys of the typewriter, and the clacking began."

 MAG.6.t:0 "The Count of Fascism"
 MAG.6.desc:0 ""Zdarova, brother Matkovsky!" A man hailed from the piers of the harbor. A lean body and a pale face, with a hand stretching out in the early morning air, waving to Matkovsky. Anastasy Vonsiatsky, also known as the Count of Russian Fascism, had set his foot in the port of Magadan. He strode forward, his steps eager and his gait quick, impatient to meet his so-called equal in the old world. Covering his nose once he discovered the smell of the docks, he looked small, pathetic against the backdrop of wooden fishing ships about to depart into the morning light.\n\nMatkovsky furrowed his eyebrows. No one in this world currently has the right to address him in such a way. Giving an awkward, pained smile towards Vonsiatsky, he and his bodyguards walked forward to meet this Count. Extending his hand, a gesture of hospitality, Matkovsky said, "Zdrastvuyte. How has America treated you?"\n\nVonsiatsky wasted no breath in clasping Matkovsky's open palms. "Great, brother." He leaned forward, planning to catch Matkovsky in a hug. Matkovsky relented. America must have changed Vonsiatsky. The intimate gestures, the overenthusiastic, unreserved spirit, and that greeting: it was all a bit much, coming from a fellow Russian. Still drunk in that spirit, Vonsiatsky said aloud, "It is the land of the free. All this," he gestured with his hand, "Is too small for us."\n\n"You seem to forget the reason you are here, brother." Matkovsky said, a hint of coldness in his voice.\n\n"No, no." He dipped his hands in his pocket. "This man is a gift from me to you." He showed Matkovsky a black and white photograph of an American in a beret."

 MAG.7.t:0 "The Wizard of Whispering Death"
 MAG.7.desc:0 "A light curtain of drizzle had descended upon the port of Magadan. The clouds adorned their bodies with steely grey, and the waters of the harbor tugged and pushed their way inland, their course halted the low-lying sea walls. Amid the piers, rows upon rows of wooden fishing ships lay steady, their hulls quivering in the fierce wind, shallow rain, and restive waves. There was one vessel that stood out among the others, a metal deck, with rust coating its bows. The tumultuous air did not even seem to flinch it.\n\nMatkovsky, followed by an aide bearing an umbrella to shield him from the downpour, walked forward to this strange vessel. If Vonsiatsky had been speaking the truth, then there was no question to the owner of this ship. Mitchell WerBell, legendary mercenary, the veteran of a thousand wars worldwide, an infamous soldier of fortune, the Wizard of Whispering death. Matkovsky steeled himself to meet this legend of a man, before seeing a figure stumbling out of the ship, staggering towards him.\n\nMatkovsky blinked. There was no mistaking it. The figure was WerBell, looking more green than in the photographs Matkovsky had seen of him, a beret hanging precariously to his scalp. Matkovsky tightened his pace, striding forward at such a pace that his aide had difficulty in following him. When he came face to face with WerBell, the man tried to give a clumsy smile, only for it to be mistaken for contempt.\n\n"Welcome," Matkovsky said, in English, "We have been expecting you, Mr. WerBell."\n\n"Privet," WerBell said, "My tovarisch." He continued in Russian, mixing it with English words when he had no clue which words to use. Matkovsky, for his part, tried to dissuade him from bastardizing the Russian language, and occasionally a word or two makes it through WerBell's manners, but he was inconsolable. What little correct Russian he spoke was sprinkled with generous helpings of "fucking" and "shit." Blushing furiously in anger and embarrassment, Matkovsky finally extended his hand.\n\n"Here's," Matkovsky said, trying to keep his smile in place, "To a start of a beautiful friendship." WerBell clasped his hand without either doubt nor comprehension."

 MAG.8.desc:0 ""Mr. Vonsiatsky! Are you there?" Dmitry rapped on the door, "Mr. Vonsiatsky! The Vozhd is waiting for you!"\n\n"It's no use, Dmitry," Ivan said, sighing and catching his breath, "I've been at this door for hours, and I haven't gotten any answers yet."\n\nTime to try something else, Dmitry thought. Kneeling, he stared at the keyhole of the doorknob. He could do this. Taking out a lockpick from his pockets, Dmitry gingerly inserted it, working as to leave the machinations inside undisturbed and unharmed. The door had to open somehow, and jamming the keyhole would only make it harder for everyone. Might even require an ax: he chuckled. Ivan was about to protest, several times, in fact. They could've just asked for a spare key, but Dmitry wouldn't hear of it.\n\nThe door clicked. Dmitry stood, containing his jump at the very last moment. "See?" He said to Ivan, who gave a dry smile in response. Dmitry turned the knob, but the door wouldn't budge. "Bolted from the inside, goddamnit!" He kicked the door in a fit of rage. Ivan tapped his shoulder, gesturing for him to move. Brandishing an ax, he swung it several times against the door, as bits and pieces of wood fly in every direction. At the very last moment, when Ivan was about to give up, the door gave way.\n\n"Mr. Vonsiatsky, are you not we-" Ivan stopped mid-sentence, laying on the floor and clutching his chest was Vonsiatsky, his eyes glassy, his face pale. He was dead.\n\nSometime in the evening, the phone in Matkovsky's office rang."

 MAG.9.desc:0 "Ivan and Dmitry did not like their new assignment. Transferred from the political wing of the RFP to the army right before the eve of the operation, they were, as their instructor put it, "dead weight." An officer handed them their bolt-action rifles and told them to stick with the rear guard, where the chance of survival was the highest. There was no danger here, and the Siberian woods were quiet, the wind whistling between the trees and the air cold as ever.\n\n"You think the Vozhd will let us back?" Dmitry asked Ivan, who was squatting beside him, watching the surroundings while smoking a flimsy cigarette. The only reply he got was a listless shake of the head and a hush. Ivan knew his stuff or at least showed that he wasn't in over his head. The hand that gripped the cig shook. It could be the air, could be genuine anxiety and terror in the face of war.\n\nA figure passed ahead, in the dirt trails they were watching: a mercenary. It was apparent from the gear they carried. Proper camouflage, an assault rifle, a belt chock-full of grenades as well as other miscellaneous tools of warfare, and, most importantly, the attitude. The man walked forward without any concern or worry, his footsteps lighter than the bravest man in the RFP. However, he had no reason to be here. The front lines were where he came from, not here.\n\n"Halt!" Dmitry said, unslinging in his rifle and pointing it to the mercenary, who did likewise. Ivan followed suit. "Turn back. The frontlines are over there."\n\nThe mercenary said nothing and shot at Dmitry. It hit, and Dmitry fell onto his back. Ivan fired back, nailing the mercenary in the shoulder.\n\nAll over the lines, incidents like these flared up, and the operation cannot continue. WerBell's coup had begun."

 MAG.10.t:0 "The Treaty of Cooperation"
 MAG.10.desc:0 ""Here is the treaty that the Tsarists sent," Petlin said, placing the draft of the agreement on the table, "sir." He almost adjusted his tie again, although the stern stare of the Vozhd stopped his left hand. Yet, those eyes did not judge Petlin's mannerisms in any detail. They went up and down the document, examining its fine print, looking for chinks in the deal that the Tsarists - or the RFP, for that matter - can exploit. No word on it seemed to raise any reaction from Matkovsky beyond an occasional rise of the eyebrows and a nod.\n\nPutting the document aside, Matkovsky turned to address his foreign minister. "Petlin," he said, chilling every bone in the minister's body. He gulped. It was the moment of truth, where the Vozhd would deliver his final verdict. "Good work," Matkovsky said after a few moments, "you exceeded my personal expectations. Before I sign this," he picked up his pen, toying with it, "is there anything else you'd like to add?"\n\nPetlin drew a deep breath. "No," he said, "There is none." Matkovsky's hand promptly drew a signature on the document.\n\n"It is done." He dropped the pen and rose. "Deliver this to the representative of the Tsarists and tell him that the Vozhd accepts the deal, and death to Rodzaevsky." Standing in front of Petlin, he offered his hand. "I appreciate that I have at least one competent person in charge of affairs around here." A smile, a rare thing for Matkovsky to show.\n\nPetlin shook his hand. "Yes, sir. I will do as you say. Your compliments are high praise for my blood and station, sir."\n\nMatkovsky patted his shoulder. "All in a day's work." Petlin turned and left where he came in."

Tonight was a special night, a time to talk with an old friend. So long as she also held on to her schedule, that is. Ten seconds out. WerBell rubbed his hands against his temples. This Siberian business was hard, and Matkovsky was proving himself to be no pushover. WerBell smirked; the damned bastard would have his due.\n\nFingers on the dial, two seconds out. When it reached ten o'clock, his right hand snapped, finding the frequency that she used, locking on to it without difficulty. He reached for the microphone and spoke at it. "White Mouse," he said, waiting expectantly for a reply, "are you there?"\n\n"You're late," a kindly, maternal voice replied, "Maybe age has slowed you down a bit after all." She laughed. WerBell smiled. On the other side was the White Mouse, One of the Brits who had the backbone to fight in a war and be good at it, and a comrade during all those times where the Americans lost the torch of liberty before falling down a set of stairs to disgrace."Good to see you, Wizard." He saw her firm, proud smile beyond the radio waves.\n\n"Likewise, Mouse," WerBell said, kicking back in his seat, the microphone standing precariously on his chest, "How is Kamchatka? Is it a shithole too?"\n\nHe felt her frowning at him. "Language, wizard," she said, sighing, "But yes, there is not much to do around here."\n\n"Still looking up to Uncle Sam?"\n\n"You know it," she said, "I know you've gone indie and all, but the OS-, no, the CIA has a proposition for you."\n\n"Forget it," He said, fuming. Make no mistake, he liked Nixon - only a good American could bring America back together, and not those cowardly liberals with their talk of "peace, land, and bread." Fucking communists. He just couldn't let go. "I still remember the last time I worked for those no-good bast-"\n\nThe White Mouse hushed him. "We also have taken your concerns to mind."

They turned the dial to Magadan Free Radio, whose frequency they had scribbled onto a piece of paper earlier.\n\nThe mix was better this time.

In front of him were remnants of a campfire, and the results from the hunt last night: two foxes and a rabbit. Waking up to greet the new day, he lifted his sidearm and looked over it, balancing it in his hands as he did so. Apart from some dirt stains, it was clean. He pressed the magazine release, and then pulled the slide back. A cartridge flew into the air with a faint ping. All the bullets were there.\n\nSo far, Oleg did not have to use his gun on anything. No bear nor leopard even came close to him, although he did see them in the wild. The foxes, rabbits, and other assorted animals he hunted were the results of his traps. Using the gun on them would ruin their flavor and make them possible unsafe to eat. To survive, Oleg learned, one must be ready to not only exercise force, but also restraint.\n\nHe picked up the stray bullet and shoved it back into its magazine. Time for his daily ritual. Setting himself down, Oleg began taking apart his gun. Setting the parts down on dried rabbit fur, he took out his canteen, and started cleaning the parts delicately. After each piece was free of grime and dust, he rubbed them on the fur, making sure they were dry. With icy fingers, he assembled the gun. To see if anything was wrong, he slid the magazine back and cocked the action. A snap. Oleg smiled. Today was a good day too.\n\nThe Siberian Rangers would come back for him, any day now."

 MAG.14.desc:0 "Rodzaevsky stepped out to the harsh morning air. Dressed in rags, two RFP guards trailed him, rifles trained on his heart and head should he try and make a run for it. They shouldn't have bothered. On his face, the fire that had burned bright during the darkest moments of the RFP in Harbin was naught but cold embers. His hands and legs chained, he hobbled forward, dragging his feet and maintaining a precarious balance and momentum.\n\nAt their front was a makeshift gallows, constructed with the sole intent of executing the former chief leader of the RFP. The Bandit King of Amur, as he was known, now walked like the poorest beggar in the Far East, towards his impending death. Three to five men patrolled the site on Matkovsky's orders to make the execution as private as possible. For all he had done, Rodzaevsky was still a former member of the RFP, a party that takes care of its own.\n\n"Stop right there," a guard said, right beneath the stairs to his doom, "I have something to ask." Rodzaevsky suppressed the urge to giggle at this man; what can a dying man say in the face of his fate? He nodded. "What did the Vozhd say to you last night?" All eyes were now on Rodzaevsky, every ear tuned to any change in the air.\n\n"Nothing much," Rodzaevsky said, sotto voce, "can we get this over already?" He intended to carry what Matkovsky said to his death. The guards brought him to the rope, which they placed on his neck. They made him stand on a stool, before aiming their rifles at him, in case he tried to escape.\n\nThey needn't have bothered. In a few moments, a guard kicked the stool from beneath him."

Dmitry was probably safe; the mercenary tagged him in his shoulders. So far, using vodka, scraps of clothing, and the bandages he found on the merc's body, Ivan had managed to staunch the bleeding, the blood gathering in dark red clots beneath the bandage's white veneer. Dmitry moaned every time they got up and down through the rough Siberian terrain, but his ragged breathing and delirious groans meant that one thing was clear: he was alive.\n\nAll the way, from the lines back to the camp, Ivan screamed until his throat was sore, "Medic! MEDIC!" Yet, the grounds were silent, and from the trees and bushes did not accept nor condemn his call for help. Dmitry was growing heavier by the minute, his weight settling into Ivan's shoulders like a cross. His breath became shorter and shorter, as the woods refuse to part way and yield to the camp.\n\nNot far now, Ivan thought, for every step he took. Not far. Every rock, fallen branches, and mounds of soil endeared themselves to his eyes and feet, as he slowed down. He was close to fainting. He took his knife out and tried to prick his thumb lightly; his touch was less than gentle, and in his panic, he slashed his hand. The wound was not deep, just enough to keep him awake. He bandaged his hands, taking a slower and measured pace.\n\nIn half an hour, he reached the camp, finding it empty and deserted. Night had descended. The medical staff had fled, along with most of the troops. Had he been faster, had he been quicker, he could have saved Dmitry. He laid his friend down on the ground, and held his hand, as Dmitry's breath faded, fainter and fainter. He tried. He really did. Fate had not given leave for Dmitry to survive.\n\nLuck did, however. A truck horn sounded, and in their headlights was Ivan, holding his friend's hand and his tears at bay. He could not believe it. Gathering his will, he said, in a shaken and torn voice, "Friend or foe? Russian or mercenary?"\n\n"Friend," came the reply, "Russian. You are safe now. The Vozhd awaits in Magadan.

Their equipment was in a similarly poor state, with most "soldiers" equipped with creaking, almost non-functional rifles like old Arisaka models and Mosin-Nagants dating back to the days of the Great War. A good fit for an army of wax models in a museum, perhaps, but not enough for a host with the intent to fight, as the Vozhd (Russian leader) humbly put it, "a total crusade to save Russia."\n\nWe commenced training as soon as we pinned down the RFP's situation. That is where we encountered another problem: the nepotism ingrained within the "officer corps" of the RFP was so prevalent that men who could barely hold the weight of a rifle bore such high ranks as Lieutenant, Captain, or even Major. Pressed on the issue, the Vozhd agreed to fire these people immediately, much to his credit. He also approved the building of several officer schools to whip up the higher ranks of his army into shape.\n\nThe reports we have received from the frontlines indicate good results. The border clashes against their neighbors have indicated a good increase in performance, regardless of victory and defeat. We will continue to monitor the situation and issue reports whenever possible. Mason out."

In Magadan, they walk around town, their expensive gear strapped to their bodies, flirting with girls and ladies they see along the way. They seemed not to have a care for Russia; it was just another playground for them, a vacation, a holiday in a desolate land where they got to shoot the natives. Smith (no given last name), in particular, came from South Africa, his hands itching for the trigger of the gun, his ears for the thrill of gunfire, his head and brain for the conduct and raw barbarity of combat.\n\nWerBell wasn't lying when he said that his gear was going to be good. His M16, strapped to his back, was the meanest piece of lead spitter this side of Russia. The RFP militias did not have them, only given old US M1 Garands instead, for they were not Smith. The fields, savannahs, plains, and jungles of Africa make themselves known through his copper, sun-burnt skin. He had all the reason in the world to be cocky. When his folks back home ask him why he had gone into the business, "To find a lady," came the answer. All who truly understood Smith knew that he wasn't in it for love, but the thrill of war and money.\n\nHe could see the Russians eyeing his gear with envy in their eyes. He smirked at them and winked. Every time he smoked, they would marvel at his tidy, clean, well-rolled cigarettes. Once in a while, he offered them one, even. Warfare was a trade, and business was good. Leaning back against a wall in a random part of the podunk town, he took one of his fabulous cigarettes out and lit one.\n\nFor a backwater and deserted place, Magadan was pretty good. Not on the level of Bloemfontein, but pleasant enough. However, his heart was never there. Out west, closer to lines of the tsarists and Rodzaevsky's loyalists, beneath the blazing gunfire and artillery bombardments, was where he belonged. With a puff of smoke, he threw the cigarette down and stepped on it. It's time for action."

He had entered Rodzaevsky's office, home to the files of almost all current and former RFP members. He chuckled. He had never taken the Bandit King of the Far East to be such a meticulous and attentive person. He looked around the room. Alcohol, drugs, coffee, every substance of comfort crowded the lone desk perched on the far end of the room, in front of the open windows. The afternoon sun's faint light filtered into the room, and the glasses of Rodzaevsky's excess glimmered like gems against the backdrop of the steel-gray sky.\n\nCovering his nose through the rank smell, he reached a drawer and pulled a file out. M section, Matkovsky, Mikhail. His photo, young and handsome, graced the file. Its pages were surprisingly clean, tidily typed. At first glance, it could pass for a well-written letter. The contents and notes of it stood in contrast to its exterior. Long, run-on sentences cursed Matkovsky, and a phrase drew his eye: "Kosher Fascist." Matkovsky smiled. Never change, old friend, never change.\n\nAll that remained, then, was to compile a list. Though most of the RFP were Russians, Matkovsky's wing of the party cannot accept Rodzaevsky's without some adjustments. Some would follow the fate of their master. Some would be free to find their fortunes in the wastes of Siberia. Some would be the RFP's prodigious children, wayward sons of Russia who lost their way. All would serve Matkovsky.

He put the set of files down and pressed his index finger against it, "This is not acceptable; it was inconceivable that you would present this to me in the first place." How could he do this, Petlin, the man who he had considered to be almost a brother to himself, his own foreign minister? He stared into Petlin's eyes, finding fear and obedience settling their weight into his psyche. Maybe this was not intentional after all.\n\n"Sir, if I may explain myself," Petlin said, freezing his hand before it can correct his tie, "The Americans are different from us. We need to-"\n\n"I get your point, Petlin, it's just," Matkovsky said, waving off Petlin, "This is not what I - not we - stand for. From what I read in your document, I find such phrases as the 'Right to assembly', 'right to free speech.' These are all dangerous ideas, not fit for Russia. Their rebellious intent seems to even jump out of the pages." Matkovsky sighed, "Just what the hell were you thinking, brother?\n\nPetlin gathered himself and stood straighter. "Sir, if I may insist, my ideas can still be useful. Not only in convincing the Americans but the Russians as well." He cracked his knuckles in anxiety. "I have faith in the strength of our ideals and conviction, sir, I do. I beg you not to mistake my incompetence as rebelliousness."\n\nNow Matkovsky became generous, stretching his arms wide. "Petlin, Petlin," he said, tapping his foreign minister in the shoulders, "I would never. You are a part of us since the beginning, closer to me than even my chancellor." He whispered to Petlin, "Now help me with all these, I am afraid that your brother lacks the skill necessary to convince the Americans."\n\n"Y-yes," Petlin said, his voice trembling, "I will do as you say."\n\n"Good.

Even though he was an American agent, trained in both formal and spoken Russian, he had never conversed in any depth with the soldiers, much less giving instruction and introduction to American weapons. He smirked. There was an irony to it all: despite having been schooled and educated in one of the most renowned countries on Earth, Mason was as out of his depth as the illiterate Russian fascists standing before him. The cold, chilly air of the early morning gave his percussive heartbeat a tinge of anxiety and excitement in his veins. The training fields were empty save for a few animals scurrying underfoot.\n\nAn officer prefaced him. "From the honorable nation of America," he goes, "Mason has come..." A bunch of feel-good bromides and legalese, but he guessed that the soldiers needed to respect him first before they would be willing to listen to him. He caught a few of them eyeing the equipment he brought here. Mason didn't think it was all that impressive, considering the things he had seen while working in the agency, but, again, cultural and technological differences.\n\nAfter a few hour-long and anxiety-ridden minutes, it was finally his turn to speak. He drew back his tongue and lashed it out, throwing the dust off the language he seldom used. "Hello," he said, "as the officer has said, my name is Mason." He grabbed an M1 Garand and held it against his shoulders. "This is the Garand. You." He pointed to a random soldier in the crowd. "Fire your weapon, see how fast you can do it." He pointed to a target in the distance. The soldier had to eject his casings every time he fired. Sometimes, he resorted to hitting his rifle with his wrist before it worked.\n\n"Now watch this," He aimed the Garand and fired eight shots in succession, his streak stopped by the ping of the gun.

He sighed, taking in the reality of his situation - while Magadan was a real town, most of the territory that he controlled was either depopulated, underdeveloped, or both. It wasn't exactly an ideal situation for a government that needed bodies and industry, as fast as possible. As a number of his ministers filed in, all of them presumably having been briefed on the nature of the meeting, Matkovsky turned to them. In his well-known, tactful manner, he addressed his audience. "It's clear that our current... industrial situation is untenable". Continuing, moving aside to show his ministers the map. "We need to take action to ensure that we're not overwhelmed by our southern rivals. It's no secret that they enjoy Japan's material support."\n\nOne minister, Goltsov, spoke up. "It will take some work, of course, but we have been thinking the same thing, we cannot allow ourselves to be outcompeted by our rivals. A few proposals can be drawn up, my Vozhd. Industrialization, under the direct supervision of the government, attracting any potential foreign investment by any means necessary."\n\nMatkovsky looked around the room, waiting for any other statements, before continuing. "Good, please do. I don't plan on matching Rodzaevsky and the Whites, I want to outstrip their production." Tacit nods from most followed - Matkovsky made his intentions clear. He wanted to turn Magadan into a city of industry. Not an easy task, certainly, for Magadan's earliest purpose was as a stop-off for the work camps and mines in the region. But if the Vozhd thought it best, it was probably best. And every person in the room, Matkovsky included, knew that if the Vozhd wanted it, it would be done.

 MAG.25.desc:0 "Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd himself, made his way down to the Magadan garrison to inspect the quality of the troops that made up his army. The chilly morning air seemed not to have an ill-effect on the Vozhd, who was seen in full military dress himself, as he and his high command approached the troops in formation. All of them were dressed like he was, and sported their weapons of war. But even before he approached them, Matkovsky could tell what poor soldiers they would make, and his generals, exchanging nervous glances with one another, knew it.\n\nOne soldier was too fat, the other malnourished. The third was too short and the fourth didn't have his uniform's buttons done up right. They all had the full uniform, but it seemed as if they had simply borrowed bits and pieces, here and there, from their peers, as a lot of it didn't fit. All of them, not just these four, were equipped with weapons that looked as if they had been outdated by the time the Germans were ravaging the west of Russia. This sorry state of affairs had made it blatantly obvious to Matkovsky that on one of the most important days of their soldiering lives, these troops could barely muster together even the smallest shred of professionalism. The inspection ended, Matkovsky politely walking along the columns of the Magadan garrison, taking mental notes. Scruffy beards, outdated weapons, ill discipline. Matkovsky knew that it wasn't their fault, for the most part. He had a chronic shortage of bodies, weapons, and officers, all of which were mandatory for the raising and maintenance of a professional army.\n\nAfter the inspection, he had called a meeting of his high command, where a rare flare of anger shone through his usual professional behavior. "What is going on? These are the best troops that you have to offer me?" he asked of his generals. A number of cursory excuses were made, of course. Matkovsky put his hand up to demand their silence. "I don't want to hear it. If those are the men who are assigned to guard the capital, what do those on the frontlines look like? How do you think we will overcome Rodzaevsky, that bastard, let alone exert our control over the entirety of Russia? I don't care what the solution is, I want you to find it.

Matkovksy's generals and administration had taken upon itself to figure out some way to improve the true RFP's fighting ability. "The answer was simple", mused one senior officer. "When we realized we couldn't use conscripts, we bought soldiers from abroad instead". Indeed, mercenaries and military advisors, state-sponsored or otherwise, have been slowly but surely streaming into the frozen port of Magadan to not only pad Matkovsky's army of ill-suited conscripts, but to train them as well, to crack the whip and bring them, kicking and screaming, into the world of professionalism. The fat ones were now skinny, the malnourished ones healthy. All of them had a semblance of fighting spirit for the first time ever, and the guns, while still archaic, were at least cleaned and maintained properly. Training, as barebones as it was, actually began to prepare the conscripts and their mercenary counterparts for the realities of modern warfare in the frigid forests and marshes of Siberia. All this of course was tacked on to a very long and expensive bill that Matkovsky had to pass off to his administration. He was confident that there would be something for them to pay the mercenaries with.\n\nAfter Matkovsky's second inspection of the troops, which like the first, was kept as a surprise, he once again called a meeting with his general staff. As they filed in, worried that the inspection was not a good enough improvement from the original, many nervously fiddled with pens, or reports, others looking anywhere but to where Matkovsky stood. But as they all assembled, the Vozhd spoke. "After this second inspection", he said, in his normal, reserved manner, "I want to say good job, to all of you". Many were surprised. "I know that the task I assigned to you was not an easy one, and while we're far from perfect, I am pleased with the progress that we're making. The path to seek out mercenaries and foreign support was not one that I would have expected, but it's clearly working, and I will be meeting with some top advisors about how to increase the numbers and effects of these foreigners".

His rifle, which he had slung behind his back, provided a comfortable weight - an anchor that kept his livelihood going. In his arms, he carried the hide of a moose, a worthy prey whose coat will suit a gentleman of Harbin snugly. Today, perhaps, Nikita could earn a bit more than it needed for him to survive for another week. Maybe a pack of cigarettes, or even a can of powdered coffee. In his head, he toyed with the image of the Vozhd wearing something made from the lovely hide of this moose.\n\nAs usual, the RFP officials and thugs guarded every entrance to the city, their brown uniforms contrasting with the pale buildings of the town. However, Nikita noticed that the RFP now had new companions among its ranks. Sharply dressed men and women armed to the teeth and speaking a thousand foreign languages, congealing into a Tower of Babel manifested in the outskirts of Russia. It was quite the sight, with the mercenaries keeping to themselves and the Russians eternally suspicious of what was going on. The officials cleared him to enter the town, provided that he left his rifle in their checkpoint.\n\nThe hide sold for some good cash. Money he could use to buy bullets, provisions, food, and medical supplies to last him for another week. There was something new to the town, however: American products. American coffee, cigarettes, and even radio were available, and quite common even. They were cheaper than native-Magadan goods, although they were often sold out by the end of the day. Nikita bought a pack of cigarettes and a can of powdered coffee. Smiling at his newest gains, he strolled to the edge of the town, returning to his home in the northern reaches of Siberia."

There, a couple of locals, their names blurring in the report sheet of the Party's policy, were playing blackjack. The gamble was over a couple of drinks and several hundred roubles, nothing big, but nothing small. They expected the night to go on as smoothly as before, a cruise into the moonlight as the games continue, pockets emptying, and men filing into the street with the grace of drunken feet.\n\nThree listless men enter into the bar, newly-arrived to the town of Magadan. They were WerBell's men, heavily armed and heartily paid: professional soldiers that hail from all corners of the world. They had too much free time. At first, they and the locals got along quite nicely. That is to say, they did not interact much at all - only silent nods and scarce eye contact bridged the difference between the group.\n\nThe uneasy truce did not last long. The listless men flirted with the girls behind the counter, and the locals did not like it. Standing up, they shouted profanities at the mercenaries, in a language they did not understand. It did not take long for the soldiers to unholster their pistols and threaten the locals. After about a minute, one of the mercenaries accidentally fired a shot, resulting in a dead civilian, only found hours later in the rioting that followed.\n\nThe locals, instead of being driven to fear by gunshots, charged the armed men, using broken bottles and chairs to take them down. WerBell's troops, dispatched as a backup for the new arrivals, got involved shortly. The Party's police, who intervened to stop more bloodshed, were met with a rain of bullets and jagged glass.\n\nA dozen civilians dead, with two dozen more wounded. The three men were immediately tried and sentenced. The Party's police, for their part, did their job - after two hours."

It wasn't the first time she noticed that her father tended to linger outside for a bit before entering their house. Now, as the sun was setting, its orange light aged his features beyond the man's already formidable years. He had joined the Party since its first days in Harbin, and was a veteran of the Anti-Bolshevik Front.\n\nPeople from inside the Party, further up in the hierarchy call her father Vlad the Tall, in mockery of his height. Outside the Party, they called him a thug, a criminal, a robber vested within an RFP uniform. Sometimes he could see the latter manifest itself when they met the neighbors. Small business owners, shopkeepers, and the fishermen of the port looked at him with a mix of fear, reprehension, and disgust. Any time any of them dared to cross Vlad's path, however, they scurried away almost immediately when he drew his gun, a trusty Nambu he had kept by his side for years, again, since the days of Harbin.\n\nIn Katerina's eyes, however, she did not find a monster in the figure of her father, standing as a single silhouette against the dying day. He felt his mask lapse and vanish every time he spoke a word to her. The icy and reserved, aloof, harsh, and cold attitude melted, revealing beneath them, if not a decent man, a husk of one.\n\nShe ran out the door, and caught her father's hand, surprising him.

 MAG.36.desc:0 "Presidential Briefing on the Free State of Magadan\n\nContents:\n\nThe nation of Russia has been a great unknown since the end of the Second World War. Following Barbarossa and the Soviet Union's collapse, the CIA could scarcely glean any information from that vast country. Except for the West Russian War of the 50s, the Russia of our imagination had become a cesspool of violent infighting, with the German bombings preventing any attempts of regional warlords to consolidate power.\n\nAt least, this seems to be the case in West Russia and Siberia. With a land area that stretched from the Baltic to the Pacific, there are some stretches of territory untouched by the banditry and chaos that plagues the areas adjacent to the German Reich. From Central Siberia, the primary recipient of the Bukharin-era Siberian Plan, we have heard that a Republic had risen and collapsed there between the Second World War and the West Russian War.\n\nThen there is the Russian Far East - a region that the CIA has been observing for quite some time. In brief, the legitimate government of the Soviet Union (under the provisional leadership of Genrikh Yagoda) retreated there after their defeat; subsequently, the Anti-Bolshevik Front sprang out from Manchuria and Harbin, making significant gains before shattering into three parts based on Chita, Magadan, and Amur.\n\nIn particular interest of this briefing is the Free State of Magadan, led by Mikhail Matkovsky - a local fascist of some repute. He and his foreign minister, Nikolay Petlin, has promised reforms and democracy should the U.S. support their bid for the - as the Matkovsky insisted - "great crusade for Russia," as well as intelligence and information.\n\nThe Agency notes that the decision is the President's alone to make. However, it cautions the President in supporting any fascist bid for Russia. Moreover, the aforementioned minister, Petlin, seems to be a more malleable candidate for leadership. Whatever the President decides, the Agency shall carry out."

 magexp.1.t:0 "The Puppet Tsar"
 magexp.1.desc:0 ""Is the meal to your liking," Matkovsky said, as his hands cut another piece of beef, "Mr. Romanov?" Sitting across from him was the alleged Tsar, Mikhail. Candlelight illuminated those eyes that a few days ago had seen the muzzle-fire of rifles as the RFP stormed the "palace" where Mikhail ruled. The truth was, despite the regal garb and silverware elegant enough to act as a mirror, Mikhail was no more than a puppet for the old-style White Army types. While he waited for the response from this "Tsar," Matkovsky put his fork to his mouth, tasting the ragged, almost-done taste of the steak. Not good, not terrible.\n\nMikhail chewed, swallowed, and set down his utensils. Before he spoke, he wiped his mouth with a napkin. Taking up a glass of wine, he turned to regard Matkovsky, his gaze crisp and calm. "It was," Mikhail said, straightening to deliver his verdict, "an adequate dinner." Matkovsky smiled at him. From what he heard about the reluctant Tsar, Mikhail was never one to hold back his honesty. For all the legitimacy he lacked, Mikhail had one thing many in the Front did not have, from the monarchists to the fascists: a spine. He took a sip. Putting his glass down with a silent thud, Mikhail said, "Mr. Matkovsky, perhaps you will entertain a question from this humble prisoner."\n\n"Speak your mind," Matkovsky said, the dinner practically over at this point, "your "Majesty""."\n\n"I realize that my position in Russia has grown rather... tenuous." Mikhail gave himself a chuckle. "Not that it has been well in the first place, but there you go." Leaning back, an act of defiance against royal etiquette, he drew a deep, heavy sigh. "So, what'll happen to me now?"\n\nMatkovsky stared at him, deliberating. This "Tsar" was a potential danger. Mikhail could be a dangerous contender for power. On the other hand, the monarchist strain in the RFP was wearing away and fast. Soon, no one would take Mikhail's claim seriously, and letting him go into exile, far away from Russia, might be the prudent - and decent - decision. Matkovsky opened his mouth to speak."

In one quick gasp, he expelled all of it out, letting his lungs bask in the warmth of the fumes and smoke. It had been an excellent day. As the Vozhd, he recognized that his work would never cease, but the heights! Oh, the heights that he had reached. From the underling of a madman into the head of the new Anti-Bolshevik Front. He snorted. Life was absurd; life was good.\n\nIn front of him was no alcohol, no whiskey, no vodka. He was drunk from another substance that had addicted him since the beginning of his career. Photo albums, in black and white, as well as in color, filled the surface of his desk. From the times of the old RFP in Harbin to the first incursion to Siberia, he had it all. Here he was, standing next to Rodzaevsky and Semyonov. There he was, inspecting the troops in the name of his old master, their black uniforms standing in contrast against a frozen background. He was young then. A true believer. A wry and sorrowful smile rose on his lips. If only men did not change. His mind wandered over the photographs, searching in vain for that turn in destiny that would perhaps have preserved their brotherhood. He found none.\n\nHe drew on his cigar again. His eyes wandered to the dusty, untouched gramophone in the corner of the room. Matkovsky stood up from his seat, and the Vozhd left the room."

He could see his breath stirring in front of him, in white, flaky pieces of air. The port had smelled the same, bearing an odor of brine and rotten fish, with a subtle tang of salt above it all. Petlin and Pavlov went up and down the piers, their silhouettes dark against the pale, weak morning light.\n\nA random thought struck him. They had not found WerBell's body. Try as he might, with his men spread out across the tundras and forests of Siberia, he could not find him. He sighed and breathed the scent of the sea. Wherever the mercenary was, he did not care. Dead or alive, WerBell was out of his way. He stepped forward and strode onto the docks.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomewhere in the world, a soft rock tune played in the background of a tropical cafe, overlooking a beach. A gruff, balding man sat in the corner, reading a newspaper, his cup of coffee untouched. He had to settle for cigarettes. He had fun in some exotic locale recently, and it was a crying shame that it ended. Fucking fascists. First they wouldn't pay, and now they kicked him out. What had the world come down to? He shook his head. No more honest employers these days, it seemed.\n\nHe put the papers down. For the first time since the morning, he tasted the coffee. Mud. It was time to look for new places, new horizons. He left some money on the table, accounting for tips, and left the cafe, cigarette in mouth."

Surplus arms from the U.S. arsenals distributed among the soldiers have had an incredible effect, and the officer training has borne fruit. I can say without hesitation that the Vozhd's army is the most advanced in the Far Eastern territories; praise only checked by the old, military adage: they still have room to grow. The prospects of the Vozhd's "Crusade", - a term he insists on to no end - seems bright.\n\nContinuing from the last report, the RFP in Magadan has defeated their counterparts in Amur. Along with this development, they quickly broke the truce they had with the Tsarists in Chita and toppled the Tsar there. In one fell swoop, Matkovsky has succeeded in reunifying the old Anti-Bolshevik Front, albeit by force. Barring other emergent factions in the area, we are confident in saying that the Vozhd currently possesses the strongest forces in the East in terms of personnel and industrial capacity.\n\nHowever, we feel the need to qualify this series of rapid progress. There remains another significant force in the Far East: the Reds and the hardline RFP. The only main concern that the RFP and U.S. personnel note are the rumors from the Northern Siberia, of a religious leader amassing power among the tribes there. Though the probability of the RFP's victory remains high, we recommend further and closer inspection of regional developments. Mason out."

For now, there were only two significant contenders, with the communists marked in red and new, rejuvenated Russian Fascist Party in blotches of black and brown. He laid his fingers on the lines that demarked the boundaries between the two mortal enemies. In the dark cold of his office, he could feel the heat rise to his touch, as decades of hatred and enmity burned in the frontlines.\n\nA thud. Petlin didn't mind it. It was probably an aide stumbling their way through the dark. He looked outside the windows of his little room. The night was bright, with momentary gaps of darkness, as the clouds conspired to keep the light of the full moon for themselves. In the coming days - he did not know when, maybe in a week or a month - would be the days of another confrontation. He sighed. If only there were another way. A knock on the door woke him up from his reverie.\n\n"Coffee, sir?" an aide said, bringing a tray full of the hot black liquid, steam rising from the cups, "I thought you wanted some, as I made some for the men."\n\n"Put it on my desk," he said, breathing a sigh of relief. At least, it wasn't the Vozhd, come to check up on his work. "Mind the map." The aide gingerly placed Petlin's cup on the northern edges of the map, its fragrant fumes spreading its way through the room. As he lifted the tray, however, he knocked it over, spilling the coffee. The aide hurriedly drew his handkerchief, but Petlin stopped him. The damage was already done. No amount of wiping would ever clean the map.\n\nThe aide withdrew from the room, profusely apologizing all the while. As Petlin examined the stain, however, he remembered the rumors from the north, of a heretic amassing his forces to free the Siberians from the tyranny of fascism and communism. While the blot expanded and absorbed more and more of the paper, Petlin found his mind wandering. Perhaps this was an omen."

As a member of the Siberian Rangers, it was perhaps unsurprising that he was handpicked for a field position in the SIA. He had to be careful not to press the paper to harshly against the tree bark, or he would tear the fragile and thin piece of grey paper apart. The notes itself were simple, what he'd seen that day, the weather and geographical conditions, as well as the dispositions of the nearby locals.\n\nThe last part troubled Oleg more than any other. He did not like talking to people. He'd sooner crawl into the trenches of the enemy, evading mines and barbed wire, with machineguns raining fire upon him than talk to a bumpkin who couldn't even get their dialect right. Still, through the rugged surface, he managed to write a tiny bit of what he'd seen and heard of the locals. The data was probably insignificant, but he didn't care. He had done what was asked of him and done it brilliantly. He even talked to one or two of the less obnoxious farmers out there in the wilds. Finishing his writing, he shoved the paper into his pockets and sat down. It was time for a moment of rest. He took out a roughly rolled cigarette and lit it.\n\nIn the hands of the SIA, individual data was useless. Collectively, however, they might be the force that decided the battle. He dragged the cigarette out, letting the smoke cloud and cleanse his mind. After this, Oleg would go into the offices of the SIA and type up his report, drawing up conclusions and recommending courses of action for the higher-ups. He would rather be in the Siberian Rangers still, but maybe this life was good enough."

It was early morning, and the roadside snow lay in thick clumps, a fair bit of distance away from the woods to which the vehicle was headed. Occasionally they would come upon a bump on the road, and the four had to lift the blindfolded man back to his seat.\n\nTo their relief, the latter was silent. The voice that had proclaimed liberation for the workers of Russia from atop the radiowaves had held back, its will broken. He could do nothing now, his eyes shut, his hands tied behind his back - his followers lay dead in the fields, and whatever remained of his legacy would thaw like snow come the next spring.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, a random spot in the middle of Russia designated as the "execution point." Opening the cargo bed, they took the blind man and brought him out by the elbow, setting him down, gently as they can, to a patch of snow-covered soil. Then, they made him stand and walked him forward, to somewhere he did not know. An atheist all his life, he confessed that he regretted nothing, and the calm stillness of the dawn greeted the eerie silence of his heart. He did not need the opiate of the masses; his pain was his own.\n\nThey took the blindfold off him, and the sunlight shocked him. How many days had it been? How many months, years - how much time? They stopped, and he knelt. His eyes remained fixated on the sky above.\n\nThey read out his sentence. Rifles clacked, and all ends pointed to his head. "By order of the Vozhd of the Russians," a voice read out loud, somewhere in front of him, "I sentence you, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin," he was ready. "To exile!" He pointed his head down and looked around him, lost. The guards gave him a revolver, two bullets, a coat, and some black bread. After that, they departed.\n\nHe wanted to laugh, and he giggled.

An officer brought a radio to the frontmost table, for tonight, the Vozhd was on the airwaves, preparing to deliver an address to the people of the Far East. It was silent, save for the clatter of plates and the slosh of liquid soup as the servers lowered their ladles unto dishes. No one touched their food.\n\nA wave of patriotic music swept over the barracks. A voice, that of their dear Vozhd, Mikhail Matkovsky, spoke, booming and echoing through the room. "Good evening, the people of Russia!" he said, "tomorrow, past midnight, a new age begins. The Reds, long traitors to the virtues of the Russian people, have been defeated. Their armies lay dead in the fields, their ideologues, their party, their presidium, their pretensions to legitimacy, all scattered to the four winds." A semblance of cheer broke out within the ranks, although everything stayed calm. The clattering and the sloshing continue between the spaces of Matkovsky's words.\n\n"My loyal soldiers, militant and martial, the armed wing of the Russian Fascist Party, the true heroes of the proletariat, have broken through the darkness that had caged and jailed Russia for so long." A patter of claps joined the clatter and slosh. "They shall be the vanguard of a new revolution - a revolution not brought about by the necessities of inhumane ideologies, but for a renewal, a rejuvenation, for a new, for a powerful Russia to take her place once again among nations!"\n\nThe patter of hands, fingers, and palms joined together, a storm that drowned all the other noises.

The sun hadn't yet set, but it was best to be ready when it did. His pen scribbled on the creamy, expensive paper that the Vozhd had brought for him, a generosity that matches the grandiose scale of his commission: the history of Christianity in the Far East. With each stroke, he struck the thought and the memory of how he came under the Mikhail Matkovsky's service, a story that he - and perhaps only he and only God - knew. He gritted his teeth, vowing to carry the tale to his grave. Each man bore a different cross, and this was his: not to die in honor but to live in shame.\n\nHis pen halted upon reaching the Fifties and the Sixties. Here, he sighed. For the sake of posterity, perhaps the future would do better not knowing the crimes done to reach a better age. Aside from the general chaos of Russia, he found himself stumped. Other than the obvious and apparent, there were no notable events that had happened in the Far East. He would have to consult his archives, documents, and books. Perhaps there he would be able to forge a narrative convincing enough, real enough, that there would be none who would question him. He opened the first book, a baptismal record, he had set on the table, and began reading, leafing through its pages to find and secure the desired truth.\n\nWithin the first few pages, the black bars started to appear. A certain Father, whose name was blotted out by thick, messy ink, had baptized hundreds in a village - the name blotted, struck out of living memory. Zakhar recognized his handiwork. He had to do it in a hurry. It had been a hard choice, but he cannot let the integral history of the monastery disappear. Zakhar remembered the Father, a man who undertook the difficult mission of proselytizing to the tribes in the north. Nobody thought that he would return, yet he did - bringing not peace but the sword. Zakhar rode out with him to the south, an aide in his war council, from the beginning, until the end.\n\nHe stepped outside, the weight of warm and bright memories twisted into darkness. The laughter, the tears, seemed to burn in his ears, a ringing sound that wouldn't cease. Then he saw the graves, their silhouettes dark against the dying sun. Rows upon rows, for miles upon miles. He saw the crosses of his comrades, men and women, that they bore in life, and that now they carry unto death. Crosses of rough-hewn wood, unmarked, and unnamed. He collapsed to his knees. Perhaps today, too, he would fail to bear his."

Yagoda himself had either died or disappeared; the Vozhd would not care for either. Preferably, the Vozhd would have had him shot - but fate did not will Matkovsky to do so. Dmitry nursed the stump that had once been his arm. He still felt it, at night, grasping at imaginary objects, gripping the handle of imagined doors, and brushing against walls that only belonged in his mind.\n\nIvan was out there, somewhere. The quiet bastard didn't even accept any form of thanks from him. A single grunt, and hands that shooed away any cigarettes, canned food, or money. Dmitry's prosthetic lay beside him, on the grass, its sockets yearning for an owner to wield them. Not now. It had been some time since the doctors amputated his gangrenous, infected arms in a dank, full medical tent. The morphine they provided had not been enough, and he still dreaded to think of the night.\n\nTurning to see the pile, he saw a guard in RFP uniform walk towards it carrying a can of petroleum. Others carried leaves, branches, and whatever flammable material they could find and smothered the pile with it. The heavy odor of petrol reeked as the guard first opened the can and then poured it on the papers, shuffling away from it, leaving a trail. Then he lit a match, and all of them watched as the fire caught the path fixed for it, and gently set the records ablaze.\n\nDmitry observed the flames burn with disinterest. What had transpired between the Vozhd of the Russians and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, he did not care. He felt the flames brush his face, its heat intensifying by every second.

A chandelier set the room alight, an unfamiliar sight to Petlin's eyes. The Cabinet usually met during the day, not at night.\n\nOnce they were all seated, Matkovsky turned to him, mouthing, "That all of them?" He gave the Vozhd a nod, who then stood up and coughed, silencing the whispering that had commenced among the ministers. "Gentlemen," Matkovsky said, "I come to you here today with a bold proposal," he tapped his fingers on the table, going around the table, counter-clockwise. "As per the recommendations from our dear friend Nikolay Petlin," he pointed at Petlin as if his point needed clarification, "who has proposed a radical change: a change that would change, perhaps the very nature of the party." Arriving at the other end of the table, he stopped, before continuing, "I understand that many of us here, including me, Petlin, Pavlov, and many others have served the cause of Russia ever since the creation of the Party in Harbin." Striding forward, he raised his voice, "However, the times have changed. The Party needs, forgive me for the trite expression, move on with the times."\n\nReturning to his former seat, he said, "I propose to do away with the affectations of the past.

A small miracle - not having to deal with the bickerings of his own party. Nikolay Petlin came to the podium, and Mikhail waited to hear what was first on the agenda.\n\n"The first order of business on the agenda; the arrest of Mikhail Matkovsky." Nikolay stated calmly, with a single bit of iron to his tone.\n\nThe Vozhd froze, and then blinked. Had he heard that right? Arrest? Him? For a moment, he assumed it was a joke. A single bit of dry humor from a man who wanted his position. However, no one in the party protested. No one in the party laughed, or raised their voice. The Laborists he had greeted just minutes ago turned pale, and the room remained utterly silent.\n\n"For numerous crimes against both Russia, and the Russian people..." Nikolay continued, but Mikhail was no longer listening. How could this have happened? How did this happen? It wasn't possible. It wasn't. But as he stood there with a dumbfounded expression, shock written across his face, the guards moved. Not to arrest Petlin, or to shoot him on the spot.\n\n"Traitor." The former Vozhd whispered once quietly, as the guards moved to restrain him. "TRAITOR! YOU - BASTARD! You and your Reformers, every last one of you a bastard! You can't - " Arms wrapped around his own. Rage, fear, and sorrow compressed into a single scream.\n\nNone of his own clique look at him as he's dragged away. The guards ignore his pleas. And Nikolay Petlin, his spineless foreign minister, his subordinate, his replacement looks him in the eye the entire time he's dragged out."

He knew what was coming, he had for weeks. Between the ominous looks from laborists, his allies disappearing, and the Vozhd's stranglehold growing ever tighter, Petlin knew a reckoning was coming. The death of any hope of freedom in Magadan was at hand. Yet, despite how much he had prepared himself mentally, the event still shook the man to his core.\n\nPetlin heard downstairs his door coming off its hinges unceremoniously as Matkovsky's thugs stormed his home. He stood up, awaiting the three armed men rushing up his staircase and into his study. As he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, suddenly his breath was stolen from him as the primed-for-combat soldier at the front tackled him at the waist. Dizzy and in pain, Petlin was rolled onto his back and shackles were snapped onto his wrists as his charges were read out.\n\nTreason. A believable charge, an expected charge. It still stung to hear that all his efforts to improve his country had earned him the title of traitor.\n\nThe traitor was dragged out into the street. His neighbours stayed indoors so as to not incur the wrath of the Vozhd. Instead, they watched through their blinds as Petlin was thrown into the back of an unmarked truck. It sped off down the street, never to return to this place. Through his blistering headache, Petlin had only one thought."

He thought back to his time with Rodzaevsky, watching as the RFP split and the old man ranted about Japanese help. Japanese?! No ture Russian would bow to a tea-drinking emperor who sat upon his silk pillows far away; the Revolution had proved that.\n\nTurning back to the shore, he saw the new banners of Matkovsky's RFP raised high, though as smugglers, such overt recognition would not help.

What was left in Russia besides despair and broken faith?\n\nThat was until the Siberian talked with him and Lena after church. He did not ask them to be indentured, nor to rob stores for his cause. He handed him a document, a promise to join the Siberian National Republic, a promise to right the wrongs of the Germans a thousand times over. He had briefly mentioned it with Lena; she was eager to go, already requesting to withdraw the boys from school.\n\nHe thought it absurd until the memories came again. The smoke and the bombs, the world he was forced to leave behind by incompotent men beyond his reach. He might not live to see his hometown again, but he would make sure his descendants would.

The thought certainly lingered in his mind, but Mikhail had enough friends in the Russian neighborhoods across the United States to keep him hidden if need be.\n\nThis was a test of the Americans and their responsiveness.

In fact, getting Matkovsky to relinquish even what little power that was given to the sobor was almost miraculous in and of itself, but even so a victory had been scored for the people of Russia, as minor as it was.\n\nIt was clear to Petlin that Matkovsky thought the matter closed, that the token reforms he had allowed would be the end of the discussion. He believed he could simply go back to closing his mailed fist ever tighter around the Russian people, but Nikolay knew in his heart that he had only just begun.

It was almost enough to make him laugh, the sheer luck that had been necessary for the success of the coup boggled the mind.\n\nHis co-conspirators had risked it all to overthrow the Tyrant, and had Matkovsky been, ironically, more like his hated rival Rodzaevsky he would have likely ended Petlin's rebellion before it had begun. Thankfully, his arrogance had blinded him to the threat brewing under his nose. Now, a similar trouble brewed even as he sat overlooking the city.\n\nIn the depths of his new office, Petlin found himself in a very precarious position. While Matkovsky was safely behind bars, support for the Tyrant of Magadan was high in the Army and the Security Service. It would be a perilous task in and of itself to prevent Matkovsky's supporters from retaking control of the government, but it would be a necessary one. For the people of Russia to prosper, Matkovsky's tyranny needs to be left in the dustbin of history."

 magreg.33.desc:0 "Something is occurring in Magadan. The citizens ignore it, trying their best to go about their daily business like these people never existed while the politicians fight over it in hushed whispers of backrooms. People are disappearing left and right, picked out of their homes in the night and rushed off to Laborist prison camps. Noticeably, most of them have been reformists. Only the Vozhd truly knows what's going on. Petlin was inches away from undermining his power, but Matkovsky had been too arrogant to acknowledge the threat.\n\nAs seen by the recent arrests, however, this will not happen again under the Vozhd's watch. Stability is the key to preserving power, and if that takes a purge, so be it."
 magreg.33.a:0 "None will be spared."

 magreg.34.t:0 "Petlin at Sea"
 magreg.34.desc:0 "Nikolay Petlin was never a fan of sea travel. The sheer emptiness of the ocean made even the Siberian forests feel comforting. But this journey was too important to waste fearing a watery grave. Petlin was to go to America for business.\n\nGathering up the contents of the briefcase, he looked forward to the mission. The Siberian National Republic needed American aid if it was to be anything more than another warlord in the mix. Considering how Rodzaevsky was moving to do the same with the Japanese, it would more likely turn Washington to his side.\n\nHe headed down the ship into his quarters; comfortable by warship standards, but not by much else. The engines began to whir as he, his aides, and his ship, set off to the West Coast."

 #Petlin
 petlin.1.t:0 "The New Republic"
 petlin.1.desc:0 "Petlin adjusted his glasses as he entered Matkovsky's office, in the old RFP headquarters in Magadan. The place definitely seemed lived in. Shot-glasses with neat whiskey in them, and bottles of vodka just gathering dust littered the desk where the former Vozhd had once sat. Matkovsky likely knew that he was being arrested, and prepared himself accordingly. Petlin just did not expect him to indulge in alcohol, in the twilight hours of his political career. Outside, the wind howled, pounding the window-panes with savage force. Petlin wanted to shiver, but he was not cold.\n\nHe remembered the sight of Matkovsky as the guards hauled him away to prison, awaiting trial. A pale face, a pair of bloodshot eyes, and a face that screamed utter defeat. Once, he had believed that Matkovsky was somewhat of a good man: standing up against the blackshirts and the savage barbarity that was commonplace in Harbin were virtuous deeds. When Petlin proposed the Siberian Bill of Rights, the old Vozhd seemed excited at the prospect of a renewed gesture at political reform. However, right in this office, a few years ago, he remembered as Matkovsky tore at his bill, decrying his ideals as "too liberal." Then came the Dalstroy scandal. Matkovsky was a monster all along.\n\n"No more Harbin," Petlin said, to Matkovsky. "No more the atrocities, no more the ideologies that debase us to the level of beasts." He strode to Matkovsky's favorite gramophone and turned it on. March of Siberian Riflemen filled the air. He picked up an empty shot glass and toasted to comrades long gone."
 petlin.1.a:0 ""To the memories of Harbin.""

 petlin.2.t:0 "Hope for Siberia?"
 petlin.2.desc:0 "Promising reports have reached the CIA from our contacts in the Siberian National Republic. A new government has usurped power from Mikhail Matkovsky's regime, and seems to bear all the signs of a functioning democracy in the making. This new government, headed by one Nikolay Petlin, also seems quite interested in strengthening ties with the US. Requests of that nature from Petlin's government have already reached the State Department, and await our response."
 petlin.2.a:0 "We could always use new friends."

 petlin.3.t:0 "Word from Washington"
 petlin.3.desc:0 "It seems our efforts to strengthen ties with the United States have borne fruit. Our foreign office has received word from American diplomats that they are interested in increasing economic and diplomatic relations between our two nations. All that remains now is to sort out the details, but that shouldn't be too much of a challenge for the Foreign Ministry. This could be the start of a beautiful relationship indeed!"
 petlin.3.a:0 "Wonderful."

 petlin.4.t:0 "Exorcising the Shadow"
 petlin.4.desc:0 ""This is ridiculous, Petlin!" Alexander Pavlov said to him in his office, "the Voz- Matkovsky might have been a criminal, but to abolish his title is a betrayal to our cause." Pavlov sighed. "Let's walk back on this, Petlin, my friend. We must safeguard the legacy of our predecessors. Matkovsky was a good man, and without him, the Party would not have reached Siberia. He was a criminal, yes, but all he did, he did for the glory of his motherland."\n\n"I believe you, Pavlov," Petlin replied, his voice calm. "However, comrade, without Matkovsky the Dalstroy would not exist as an entity. The papers," Petlin was exasperated. "The papers in the Irkutsk Presidium. Remember that? The paper trails he'd burnt to cover his trace. The Soviets might not be our allies but their insight is important. Matkovsky is a criminal, and I will see him tried. No trace of his influence shall remain in this - in my - party. I hope you understand."\n\n"Fine. if you would not recognize his existence, then I will not recognize your government." He pointed at Petlin. "Listen, Petlin. I never liked you much in the old days, but now, there is no reason to hold back. You are not my Vozhd, Nikolay Petlin, and I will make sure the Laborists know that. The SIA, too." He stormed out the door.\n\nPetlin was tempted to call out to him, using the American expression. What was it again?"
 petlin.4.a:0 ""Don't let the door hit your ass on your way out.""

 petlin.5.t:0 "Criminals No Longer"
 petlin.5.desc:0 "The bare feeling of legs without shackles was new to Ivanov. The Dalstroy had put him to work digging railways and pointless public works for his association with the NKVD. He toiled, day and night, under starvation rations, sure that he would collapse at any given moment. His body was weak, and the work certainly did him no favors. Ivanov looked at his shoulders and arms. Boney, without much substance nor muscle. The soup they ladled out, thin and unappetizing, did not provide for much sustenance.\n\nThen, armed guards of the Siberian National Republic strode into the camp, arresting everyone. Some of the wardens ran to the woods, after a gunfight with the army. Ivanov heard that the rogue guards had been detained, awaiting trial, same as with their Vozhd. The act startled him. Justice in the depths of the Russian Far East was not unlikely; it was impossible. Yet, there he was, the soldiers casting off his shackles and delivered him away from that hell.\n\nNow, his only concern was that he needed a job. However, surely, President Petlin and his Prime Minister would take care of that. No more shadows, no more domination by powers that only sought power."
 petlin.5.a:0 "Only Justice."

 petlin.6.t:0 "Memories of Harbin"
 petlin.6.desc:0 "The scene was perhaps familiar. Petlin remembered the evenings and nights in Harbin, as the Russian Fascist Party celebrated its zenith. The swastika, the hooked cross ran through by electrified lights, shone like a Christmas tree in the freezing winds of Harbin winters. Yet, they stood, neither fire nor flames warming their hearts, but through the strength of will alone. Love, too.\n\nLove, the strongest of all emotions. It was love that brought them into Russia again. It was love that made them think of Russia when the Japanese and Chinese ignored and discriminated against them. Yet, it was love that also begat Rodzaevsky's obsession with a pure Russia, that justified the Dalstroy's atrocities. As Petlin and the people of Magadan held the candles in the remembrance of such tragedies and feats of will, they closed their eyes and prayed. A choir song soft hymns to God, of forgiveness and repentance. Petlin closed his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his own past. An organizer, of voices that once spoke of him with warmth and looked out for him. Of Matkovsky, of Rodzaevsky - they were young then, and all so foolish. So, so foolish. When he opened them, the patriarch led the flock through the Lord's prayer. Petlin followed."
 petlin.6.a:0 ""And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.""

 petlin.7.t:0 "Goodbyes"
 petlin.7.desc:0 ""Well, Lydia," Petlin said, at the entrance hall to his house, addressing his wife. "I'm off, and maybe for some time. It's going to be a few days, weeks, I don't know. I promise you that I'll be back soon." He regarded his wife with a broad smile on his face. Petlin was proud of her. A dissident in her own right, a powerful and active woman, freed from the clutches of Rodzaevsky the madman. He shuddered to think of what the deranged Vozhd had done to her, but she did not tell of her days in Harbin much.\n\n"See you, dear." Lydia said as she corrected her husband's tie. "Where are you going again? I have been on Magadan for so long that I don't know much about Russia."\n\n"Novosibirsk. The city of the Sun, as they call it, dear. I know that I will be far from you, but this is necessary. Soon, you will leave Magadan, and we shall go westwards. The state cannot hold a government from such a remote position such as Magadan."\n\n"I liked it here, at least."\n\n"I know. We will return here someday when Russia is whole again. Perhaps we'll even cross the straits, into America. See Los Angeles, San Francisco! Maybe even Vegas."\n\nShe smiled, a twinkle of enthusiasm in her eyes."
 petlin.7.a:0 ""It's a promise, dear.""

 petlin.8.t:0 "The Assembly of Novosibirsk"
 petlin.8.desc:0 "The conference at Novosibirsk took place behind closed doors, within the old halls of the city's local presidium. Whatever media that Russia had, as well as some foreign outlets from America, trailed the proceedings. All deputies of the Russian National Party refused to comment. Petlin hurried away on his car before the reporters could reach him, bodyguards shoving the crowds away from him. Whatever that could be gleaned from the discussions within seemed to speak in favor of reformism, although no one knew its details.\n\nFinally, on one crisp morning, Petlin stepped out on a podium, the rest of the Russian National Party behind him. "People of Russia and Siberia," he began, gathering his strength to address a nation. Or half of it. "I stand before you today, the leader of the Siberian National Republic, its president by the will of arms." He paused. "But that will be no longer. I declare thusly: that political parties are now legal, that the government will now seek approval from its people. We dedicate ourselves to the restoration of a democratic, and republican Russia." All eyes were on him. "That is all."\n\nCheering broke out as he turned his back to face his party. In the middle of cold Siberia was a small spring of warmth. The media did not know of it, but Petlin smiled at their enthusiasm."
 petlin.8.a:0 "The Siberian thaw has begun."

 petlin.9.t:0 "The Siberian Constitution"
 petlin.9.desc:0 "After his declaration at the end of the Assembly of Novosibirsk, Petlin had gathered independents, laborists, and his own wing of the party together to discuss the specifics of a new constitution to replace the old Bill of Rights. In this, Petlin added provisions that defended the rights of free speech, assembly, and the right to organize politically. The laborists grumbled and complained, but they did not have sole power on the party anymore. The independents, at first wary of Matkovsky, soon warmed up to him. Finally, after years of dictatorial rule, a leader who would listen to their concerns.\n\nStanding in the halls of the Novosibirsk Assembly, Petlin remained the previous years, standing before Matkovsky as the presented his idea of a Bill of Rights before the Vozhd. "Too liberal." The words came back to him. "I am suspecting that you are a socialist, Petlin." He gave a chuckle. How was he so weak? If the same Vozhd returned to him, clad in his full glory, Petlin would not submit. The peoples of Russia have their rights, and he shall not deny them their entitlement. He swore that no one shall experience what had happened in Harbin, ever again.\n\nA couple of Siberian deputies approached him, hammer-and-sickle pins on their suits. Petlin became weary, but then they invited him to dinner. He smiled. Perhaps the communists are not as bad as they say, after all."
 petlin.9.a:0 "A new democracy is born."

 petlin.10.t:0 "Enemy, Mentor, Protégé, President"
 petlin.10.desc:0 ""Do you visit me just to gloat, Petlin?" Matkovsky shot him a venomous look. "When I am dying, you come to me. Foreign Minister, Deputy, protégé, but above all, a traitor to our ideals. A traitor to Harbin!" Matkovsky rose from his bed but collapsed right back into it. When Petlin moved to help him, he held his hand out. "I do not need a traitor's help." He coughed blood. "I am close to dying, and I see my vision for Russia burning before my eyes. Its arsonist stands before me, yet I can do nothing."\n\n"Matkovsky," the name sounded strange on Petlin's tongue. "Would those that stand for the memories of Harbin let the pressure heaved upon us against our own people? If a decent man sees the Dalstroy and condemns it not, would it make him true to the memories of labor in Harbin, where women sold themselves on the streets, out of desperation? Tell me that," he held his breath. "Vozhd of all Russians."\n\n"You have no right to address me as such! You lowly worm, lowest of the low. To say that I despise you would be an understatement, Petlin."\n\n"The feeling is mutual, Matkovsky." They stared at each other, too angry to continue the conversation. "Trust me with Russia. I will take care of her well."\n\nA light of sympathy burned in Matkovsky's eyes. "Perhaps. Petlin, if you do not succeed. I will torment you in Hell. Remember that. Now, leave me, Mr. President.""
 petlin.10.a:0 "Mentor and protégé reconciled within one common wish."

 #Matkovsky
 matkovsky.1.t:0 "A New, Winter Dawn"
 matkovsky.1.desc:0 "Matkovsky had been here before, in the misty days where Magadan constituted his only territory. His office was cleaner, his vodka more expensive, and the stationary both more reliable and better to grip. Yet, the old Harbin feeling never left him. He looked at the window, seeing petals of snow unfurl and split in mid-air, the howling of the winter winds dying against the glass-panes. Some flakes stuck, but they slid down, leaving a trail of clear liquid behind them.\n\nHe turned his attention to the list. Sheets upon sheets of names, blotted out in the order of their execution. At the top of the list was his enemy: Nikolai Petlin. The name was crossed out, but in truth, Matkovsky did not know where he went. Still, it was preferable to keep his absence in a more permanent state. Nikolai Petlin was dead, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAides came and went by his room, carrying a chill with them, shivering as they handed out reports of the purge to the Vozhd. "Hey," Matkovsky said to a lanky, blond aide. "Turn that gramophone on." The roar of music and the howl of the winds masked the gunshots, out in the Siberian wilds."
 matkovsky.1.a:0 "A Vozhd's work never ceases."
 
 matkovsky.2.t:0 "A Siberian Bill, Renewed"
 matkovsky.2.desc:0 "Once upon a time, the Vozhd of the Russians entrusted his loyal follower to write a constitution for him. The minister in charge was Nikolai Petlin: the traitor, the man responsible for the poisonous current of liberalism that ran in the Vozhd's party. His venom corroded Matkovsky's hold, like venom hissing upon contact with steel. The Vozhd was a merciful man, full of lenience. Yet, he could never let this sort of thing occur ever again. Not the least when he was this close to power.\n\nSo, he would have to be strict. He had entrusted the Russian before with the powers of political liberties and free speech, yet, they betrayed him. Tonight, by himself and a candle-lit room, Matkovsky would bind together a Siberian Bill of Rights. A new one, with none of the flaws of the old. He had to. If the Russian people and dissidents of the Party would defy him, he found no better alternative than self-defense.\n\nHe would start by cutting. The former Bill of Rights was too long, too wordy, too ponderous. It spent a lot of its length clarifying useless liberties that could threaten the Party's position. Matkovsky did away with them striking provision after provision with slashes from his pen.\n\nWhen morning light spilled from the windows to his desk, he rose, a new Bill in his hand. The Vozhd smiled, his work done."
 matkovsky.2.a:0 "Never shall the mistake be repeated."
 
 matkovsky.3.t:0 "Voter Rolls"
 matkovsky.3.desc:0 "When his village announced the new voting rolls for his district, Aysen was excited. Perhaps the Vozhd of the Russians would not be the leader of Russians alone. Yet, he, with the rest of the Sakha people living there, found their names absent from the board. Aysen's eyes looked over the A section, over and over again, sure that there was a mistake. It was blank as if the local officials had skipped over him.\n\nSo, this day, he came to the offices of the electoral commission, seeking to complain. Aysen was rightfully a citizen of the state, and he would not see his rights violated. Inside the log-built wooden building was a burly man who attended a thin slab of plank for a table. Two guards, armed with rifles and pistols, stood on the opposite corners of the room. A door was at the back, leading further into the innards of the office. Approaching the man, Aysen said, "Sir, I am sorry for interrupting your work, but my name is not on the voting roll."\n\nThe man smirked. "Are you Yakut?" he said. Aysen nodded. "My, my." He barked at the guard in Russian, who went to the backs of the office and summoned a paper form, composed of five to six sheets. "Fill this form and do the test. I will decide if you can vote."\n\nAysen spoke Russian, but not this kind of Russian. Scientific nomenclatures, technical terms, so many things he could not understand. The form was a literacy test, he realized. A way to cheat the Sakha people from their right to vote. Still, he filled the form with every ounce of knowledge in his mind and handed it to the man.\n\nAn affected disappointment. "I am sorry, but you can't. Perhaps once you've studied a bit more, you would be able to do so. However, as it stands, I can see nothing good coming out of you voting." A smile. "No offense." Aysen left the office fuming, but also frustrated."
 matkovsky.3.a:0 "The Party needs competent voters."
 
 matkovsky.4.t:0 "Status Report"
 matkovsky.4.desc:0 "A report was thrown on Matkovsky's desk from the State Intelligence Agency, spilling out sheets of paper and dossiers filled with printed reports and graphs. On its cover, it read 'THE SITUATION IN THE WEST' - gathered intelligence providing a comprehensive oversight of the warlords and bandit republics clashing in Central Siberia. The Vozhd gave the papers a long and skeptical stare, before reaching over and carefully flicking through each page.\n\nHe scoured over each sheet, examining the details of every bolshevik briggand and opportunist despot rampaging throughout the icy region. Like animals, they skirmished with each other for scraps of food and resources in the frozen plains to the west. Finally, the Vozhd came to a page detailing various strategic and logistical plans for a possible annexation and integration of the region, and his eyes began to glow.\n\nHis authoritarian ego nourished, Matkovsky smirked and tossed the document back on his wooden desk. He leaned back in his chair and reflected upon the proposal, exciting his senses with all kinds of plans to march westwards."
 matkovsky.4.a:0 "This is only the beginning."
 
 matkovsky.5.t:0 "In the Interests of National Security"
 matkovsky.5.desc:0 "The Vozhd, upon realising control over much of Eastern Siberia, has returned his attention to matters of state security. After all, in order to have a stable republic, he explains, it must be protected from within and without. Thus, it has been determined that the State Intelligence Agency is to have far greater autonomy from legal restrictions and the authority to conduct operations that will safeguard our nation against subversives and revolutionaries.\n\nDoors are kicked down, homes are raided, hundreds are arrested, and traitors are shot. In the name of national security, there can be no margin of error. The Vozhd cannot afford to let this young republic, this great hope for Russia, fall to seditious villainy from the dark corners of the eastern wastes. The siberian wilderness is unforgiving, and for the crime of treason, Matkovsky is too."
 matkovsky.5.a:0 "We will take no chances."
 
 matkovsky.6.t:0 "Fair Elections"
 matkovsky.6.desc:0 "There were three names on the ballot for the Tomsk-12 constituency. Two were the candidates of the Russian National Labor Party, who had all the support the Party could give them. Time in the local radio, campaigning funds, and the posters with their names that stuck on seemingly every window-corner of a Tomsk street. The Peace Preservation Act had mandated strict ideological requirements for political parties, effectively disqualifying any of the Tomsk Salons from running.\n\nThe other candidate was an independent, a former Bastillard. He entered the elections knowing full well that he was at a disadvantage. None of the old Salons could help him. Radios and newspapers refused to give him interviews. He had some discreet money funneled through by his old pals in the Bastillards, but that itself was a dangerous proposition. Should the authorities discover them, he would be charged with fraud and disqualified from the election. So he did what he did in his Bastillard days: standing on street-corners trying to insult people enough to pay attention to him. Some days, he could have a conversation. Others, the police hauled him away, naming him a "public pest."\n\nWhen the votes were tallied at the end of the day, the result was unsurprising. Ninety-five percent voted for the RNLP candidates, the rest going to the independent."
 matkovsky.6.a:0 "Without political cause, there can be no political resistance."
 
 matkovsky.7.t:0 "Volunteer Work"
 matkovsky.7.desc:0 "After the primaries, Alyosha spent his days milling about the town of Amur, doing odd-jobs and nothing in particular. He had spent a fortune to enter the Russian National Labor Party, only to be defeated in the primaries. Alyosha's politics were liberal: he had hoped to join the RNLP with the express purpose of reforming it from within. Now, bereft of money and opportunities, his days went by too slowly but also too quickly, like candles.\n\nIt didn't take too long for the SIA to find Alyosha. He was not a discreet man, and his behavior had attracted attention. Just as he entered a bar to drink his worries away, two men, one thin and tall, one stocky and beefy, tapped him on the shoulder. "Mr. Alyosha?" they said, "Could you please come with us? We are from the Party. We need to talk."\n\nAt first, Alyosha was hopeful. Maybe the Vozhd saw potential in him as a politician and had sent these two men to give him a second chance. However, his flights of fancy were brought down by the weight of gravity when he realized that these two men were probably from the SIA.\n\nTaking him to a quiet street corner, they interrogated Alyosha on his faith for the Russian people, before asking him to volunteer in the Dalstroy. His face paled, but he had little choice. "Yes," he said. "Yes.""

 matkovsky.8.desc:0 ""Phoning-in this morning, we have received firm assurance from Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the Siberian National Republic, that efforts towards the strengthening of their free republic have recently undergone significant improvement. We have insisted in the past that if they want to hear anything from the United States, they too must show their dedication to the rights of men, to which they have appropriately adjusted and committed themselves to.\n\nMatkovsky presented evidence to suggest that the treatment of minority groups has improved from the Russian ruling establishment. Moreover, we are assured that liberties guaranteed in law have been respected by the state and law enforcement across the nation. Indeed, our own few diplomats across the Pacific have given us the thumbs up after being taken on a tour of Siberia by dozens of state officials to see the great potential of the region, not giving us a single tip for anything worthy of criticism in the young republic.\n\nMatkosvky was slow in his replies when we questioned him, but we have faith he will follow through on his promises. Until then, we will continue our diplomatic missions to discover more about the mysterious eastern republic now cozying up to us."

 matkovsky.9.desc:0 """AND HALT!"\n\nThe ranks of Siberian Rangers stopped their march, and a great crash echoed throughout the encampment as the soldiers stamped their boots. They stood in regimented columns, upright in rows and awaiting Captain Oleg's next command. These were the new recruits and they had been undergoing viscous training in the wilderness of Siberia to acclimatize them to the bitter eastern chill. Training was harsh, and the officers harsher, but such strict order could carve these men into warriors worthy of the Vozhd's command.\n\nResisting the harsh Siberian cold, they stood still as Captain Oleg walked past and examined each recruit. He looked at each one of the men in the eye and studied their posture. His gaze was piercing and intimidating, his very stare disciplining any sense of disloyalty in the young men's hearts. Captain Oleg reached the end of the column, to which he raised his hand for a moment and the recruits lifted their rifles to their side in synchrony. With his back turned to the recruits, the collective clatter of the rifles reminded Captain Oleg of his early days in the military, and he gazed back at the men to notice they were far more skilled than he was. He smiled beneath his bushy mustache and chuckled for a moment, before returning to his cold and unforgiving gaze."

 matkovsky.10.t:0 "Grim Tidings"
 matkovsky.10.desc:0 "Matkovsky sat in his office, drinking wine. Finally, after all these years, a vintage worth its legacy. Warm, sweet, it made Matkovsky tipsy and slightly drunk. The gramophone from Harbin sat in the corner of the room, blaring nostalgic songs: patriotic marches, anthems, Tchaikovsky. The sweet tunes and melodies of his youth brought back memories of him as a teenage boy in the Paris of the East. Finally, all that suffering, all that pain, was worth it.\n\nA knocking on the door, a disturbance to the rhythm. His doctor came through the door, lathered in an icy sweat. His glasses seemed to tremble as he walked forward, his eyes averted from Matkovsky's face. "S-sir," he said, stammering, fear apparent in the crashing of his teeth, "I-I bring you bad news."\n\nLeanig back on his grandiose chair, Matkovsky spoke. "What kind of bad news, doctor? Can't you see that the Vozhd is having a good time? Can't it wait? Surely you do not dare risk my wrath."\n\n"N-no, sir. It absolutely cannot." Swallowing, he continued. "I am afraid you are afflicted with cancer, sir."\n\nFor a moment Matkovsky sat still. He could not believe what had traveled through the doctor's lips. Cancer? Him? At the peak of his life, at this very moment? Lies! Lies! He stood up, calmly, wine glass in hand. Matkovsky jerked his arm back and forward again, catapulting the glass into the doctor's suit, splattering him in red. He wanted to shout, to scream, but he had to be calm.\n\n"Guards! Guards! Take this man away from me!" Boots trampled into the room. "Volunteer him for Dalstroy work. Make sure he is thoroughly educated. Understand?" Nods. "Dismissed." They carried the doctor out, and sobbing trailed after their departure."
