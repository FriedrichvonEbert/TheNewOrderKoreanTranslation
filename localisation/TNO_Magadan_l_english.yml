 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC: "미하일 알렉세비치 마트코프스키는 여러 면에서 로자예프스키의 사상과는 대조적인 러시아 파시즘의 형태를 보여줍니다. 로자예프스키가 독단적이고 실용주의적이며 숙련되고 불타는 웅변가라면 그는 협상가이며, 재치와 정치적 수완을 이용하여 정적들을 그의 편으로 장악해나갑니다. 로자예프스키가 흑색셔츠단의 반유대주의적 진취성을 칭송할때, 마트코프스키는 그들의 폭력성을 경멸했습니다. 둘의 목표는 아주 잠깐 동안은 일치했습니다. 둘의 협력으로 더 많은 러시아 망명자들이 파시즘을 매력적으로 보게 되면서 RFP회원수는 최고조에 달했습니다.\n\n그 후 대조국전쟁이 발발했습니다. 독일이 러시아를 상대로 대대적인 말살을 벌이면서, 둘 사이의 갈등은 더욱 커져갔습니다. 히틀러의 파괴적인 대량학살의 의도에도 불구하고, 로자예프스키는 꿈에 그리던 볼셰비즘으로부터 자유로운 러시아를 마침내 손에 넣길 바라며 그를 지지했습니다. 그러나 마트코프스키는 그런 환상따윈 가지고있지 않았죠. 독일은 대소전쟁 동안 그들의 러시아와 러시아인에 대한 인종적 증오심을 들어내었고, RFP가 어떠한 호소력을 얻든지 간에 나치는 어떠한 독립 러시아도 그들의 계획에 포함하고있지 않았습니다. 하지만 마트코프스키의 재치로 그와 그의 도당은 침묵을 지키며 그들의 시간을 벌었고 그를 통해 세력을 키워나갔습니다.\n\n때가 되자,그들은 로자예프스키에 맞서 마가단시를 점령하고 그의 개들을 몰아내 공식적으로 당을 분열시켰습니다. 이제 자신의 영토를 차지하고있는 마트코프스키는 모국의 파멸로부터 러시아를 구하고자합니다. 이 목적을 위한 수단은 일본을 건너 바다를 가로질러 놓여있었습니다 바로 미국이죠. 마트코프스키와 같은 노련한 협상가에게조차 외세의 권력을 설득시키기란 어려운 과제지만 불확실함만으로 그를 멈추게할 순 없을것입니다."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_70S_DESC: "축음기의 웅성거림, 접시에 부딪치는 은식기 소리, 금과 은으로 장식된 방의 반짝임, 미하일 알렉세비치 마트코프스키의 손아귀 안에 있는 세상의 모든 풍요로움입니다. 그러나 그는 하얼빈을 떠올리게 하는 발작처럼 갈비뼈 아래 고통의 격렬함이 모두 서서히 사라지는 것을 느꼈습니다. 죽음에 직면하기 전에는 모든 사람이 부족하게 사는 법 입니다. 러시아의 보즈드도 예외는 아니었죠. 포도주 냄새와 모르핀을 유혹하는 냄새가 그의 경험들을 무디게 하는 것 같았습니다. 하지만 아침이 왔을때, 보즈드는 그의 파멸을 직면하고있습니다. 느리고 고통스런 죽음, 운명의 광대와 기회라는 이름으로 굴려지는 주사위에 의한것입니다.\n\n화학요법, 의학, 약, 알약, 그가 시도한 모든 것은 소용이 없었습니다. 패배의 고비에서 몇 번이고 그를 구해낸 미국 친구들도 어깨를 으쓱거릴 뿐이었습니다. 마트코프스키는 늙었습니다. 이제서야 권력의 정점에 이르른 그 존재는 나락으로 치닿고있었습니다. 아무리 정치적 연줄, 계략, 숙청도 그를 치유할 수 없었습니다. 가엾고 딱한 자로다! 만일 그가 내장을 찢고 이를 끝낼 수 있다면 좋겠지만 이는 불가능합니다. 마트코프스키의 몫은 사는 것이었고, 그는 살 것입니다.\n\n자신의 죽음이 의심의 여지가 없을 때, 남은 것은 반짝거리거나 웅웅거리거나 달가닥거리는 것이 아니라, 유산의 조용한 우세함뿐이지요. 그래서 마트코프스키는 러시아와 독일 영토를 나누는 철조망을 가로질러 서쪽을 바라봅니다. 여기서 그는 역사에 그의 이름을 올릴 것입니다. 전쟁이나 평화를 통해, 보즈드는 더 이상 이를 신경 쓰지 않았습니다. 방법은 둘 뿐이고 목적은 수단을 정당화합니다. 결국, 끝은 가깝고 가까운 곳에 있기 때문이죠."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_PETLIN_DESC: "러시아 파시스트당의 다른 고위 인사들과 달리 니콜라이 니콜라예비치 페틀린은 망명자가 아닌 하얼빈 출신이었습니다. 처음에는 이 차이는 표면적인 수준으로 보였습니다. 하얼빈에서 극작가, 작곡가, 작가로 활동한 페틀린은 러시아 파시스트당에 입당해 정치 조직자로서의 재능으로 주목받았습니다. 곧 그는 파시스트 청년 조직의 지도자가 되었고 훗날 콘스탄틴 로자예프스키의 러시아 파시스트 최고 평의회의 한 자리를 차지하기 전까진 마트코프스키와 로자예프스키의 개성에 둘러싸인 소심한 남자로 있었습니다.\n\n독일군이 러시아를 침공하자 페틀린은 나치의 침략에 대한 로자예프스키의 지지를 비난하며 항의의 뜻으로 사임했습니다. 그때부터 마트코프스키가 자신의 파벌을 생존시키기 위해 로자예프스키로부터 분리하는 행동이 있을때까지 그는 마트코프스키의 RFP 파벌에 머물며 개인 비서로 지냈습니다. 페틀린은 자신이 다시 일어서는 것을 발견했고, 전 러시아의 보즈드에게 분열이 일어나자 그는 그를 대리인으로 임명했습니다. 페틀린의 치하에서, RFP는 마트코프스키가 몇 번이고 전복시켰던 의제인 개혁을 약속함으로써 미국에 환심을 사는 아젠다를 추구하였습니다.\n\n페틀린은 러시아 파시스트당이 러시아 국민노동당이 되었을 때 그곳에 있었습니다. 그는 시베리아를 정복할 때 그곳에 있었고 이르쿠츠크와 야쿠츠크의 도시들을 행진했습니다. 그는 달스트로의 죄에 대해 마트코프스키의 사임과 체포를 위해 그곳에 있었습니다. 이번에 페틀린은 망명자들의 지도 아래 러시아로 민주주의가 돌아오면 반드시 그 자리에 있을 것이라고 맹세했습니다. 그의 운명은 하얼빈의 구원이 되고 말 것입니다."
 
 POLITICS_MITCHELL_WERBELL_DESC: "재치와 우월한 화력만으로 시베리아의 도시를 손에 넣는 미국인 용병의 이야기는 싸구려 삼류소설에 쓰기에도 좀 그런 이야기 같습니다. 하지만 현실은 때때로 상상보다 더 나가는 법이죠.\n\n미첼 리빙스턴 워벨 3세는 러시아인 망명자의 아들로 미국에서 태어나 자랐습니다. CIA의 전신인 OSS에서 잠깐 일한 경험은 어둡고 치명적인 용병 업계에 뛰어드는 발판이 되었습니다. 구린 냄새가 나는 임무들은 쿠바에서 캄차카까지 전 세계에서 벌어졌습니다. 하지만 그는 여전히 미국의 산업계 엘리트들과 아버지의 오랜 동지들과 연락하고 있었습니다. 그렇게 아는 이들 중에는 갈수록 늙어가는 러시아계 미국인 파시스트 아나스타시 본시아츠키도 있었습니다. 마가단의 미하일 마트코프스키 정권이 본시아츠키를 미국 지원의 입구로 써먹기를 원했을 때, 워벨은 기회를 보았습니다. 그 뒤에 벌어진 일은 자살에 가까운 광기라고 할 정도로 대담했지만, 그 모든 역경에도 불구하고 그는 성공했습니다.\n\n외교, 오랜 친구들에게서 이끌어낸 호의, 그리고 잘 준비된 군사 습격으로 워벨은 성공적으로 마가단 내에서 권력을 잡았고, 이 도시를 서알래스카 공화국의 수도로 선포했습니다. 그는 마트코프스키가 본시아츠키에게 바랬던 것에 정반대의 이루기를 바라며, 미국의 돈과 무기가 그의 신생 시베리아 제국으로 끝없이 흘러들가는 통로가 되었습니다. 하지만 워벨의 이웃들은 그를 바닷속에 던져넣기만을 원합니다. 이는 그가 다룰 수 있는 것보다 훨씬 더 큰 일일지도 모릅니다..."

 POLITICS_MITCHELL_WERBELL_70S_DESC: "모든 역경을 딛고 미첼 리빙스턴 워벨 3세는 성공을 이뤘습니다. 운과 능력, 그리고 미국의 무한한 원조 덕에 러시아 합중국은 지구에서 가장 거대한 국가들 중 하나가 되었으며, 세계는 충격을 먹었습니다. 분석가들은 아직도 기이한 형태의 그의 정부가 어째서 붕괴하지 않는지의 까닭을 알아내고자 노력하고 있으나, 정작 본인은 돈더미 위에 앉아 이들을 비웃을 뿐입니다.\n\n워벨은 절대 쉬는 법이 없습니다. 그는 내부관리, 대외관계, 개인관계에 끊임없이 신경쓰고 있으며, 상인은 단지 러시아를 통일하는 것에 만족하지 않는 것이 분명해 보입니다. 국경 없는 용사들에 대한 그의 헌신은 변함없지만, 러시아에 미국식 민주주의를 정착시키려는 그의 의지 역시 변함없습니다. 이러한 모순이 어떻게 해결될지는 두고 봐야겠지만, 일부 사람들은 지친 러시아 국민들에게 워벨이 실제로 좋은 것을 가져다 줄 것이라 희망을 품고 있습니다.\n\n많은 이들에게 미국인이라고 비난받는 워벨은, 일본과 독일에 대해 노골적인 적대감까지는 아니더라도 어느 정도의 경계심이 있습니다. 그는 조국을 사랑하지만, 그렇게 강한 애정을 갖고 있진 않습니다. 군대의 지지를 받는 그는 통찰력 있는 남자이며, 세계는 숨죽이며 그의 다음 움직임을 지켜보고 있습니다."

 #Matkovsky
 MAG_Vladimir_Kibardin_hog: "블라디미르 키바르딘"
 MAG_Vladimir_Kibardin_hog_desc: "------------\n§LSecretary of the RFP centered in Magadan, Vladimir Vladimirovich Kibardin has been a loyal follower of the Vozhd since the beginning. From exile in Harbin, the crossing of the Amur River, then solitude in the Port of Magadan, Kibardin has stayed by Matkovsky's side through every trial and tribulation Russia and the communists had to offer. However, if Matkovsky is the pragmatist of the RFP, Kibardin would be the dogmatist, his struggles only furthering his devotion to the ideology of fascism. To Kibardin, orthodox fascism is the only hope for Russia; meaning no evolution or devolution in the case of Rodzaevsky could change that.\n\nHowever, Kibardin's worship of orthodox principles could mean he is more loyal to the ideology of fascism than the Vozhd himself. One day, Kibardin might have to choose: His Vozhd, or his ideology?§!"
 MAG_Nikolay_Petlin_for: "니콜라이 페틀린"
 MAG_Nikolay_Petlin_for_desc: "------------\n§LNikolay Nikolayevich Petlin was born a Harbin native and has been a prominent member of the RFP for decades. Joining Matkovsky's wing after the split of the RFP, Petlin has found himself with a growing disillusionment with fascism, first with Rodzaevsky, and now in Magadan. Every day Petlin leaves his office, he sees his fellow Russians living in fear of the whims of the government and the one tyrant who has total control of their lives. Fascism isn't working, any form of it, and Petlin was only beginning to see the entire truth of the matter.\n\nHowever, with his job as the Chief Foreign Diplomat for the party, Petlin believes he has discovered a new path for Russia, the American path. For the most part up until now, contact with America has been sparse. However, Petlin plans to change that, and maybe one day the American model could come to Russia, reforming the fascist state into something freer, something every Russian could live in without having to fear for their lives or the lives of their families. Petlin's past sins continue to gnaw at him every night, and if making Russia into a better place is the only way for redemption, then he would have to try.§!"
 MAG_Igor_Kovalchuk_Koval_for: "이고리 코발추크-코발"
 MAG_Igor_Kovalchuk_Koval_for_desc: "------------\n§LWith Petlin having been arrested and the Laborists securing their power, a new replacement for the office of Chief Foreign Diplomat had been necessary. That job has been given to one Igor Konstantinovich Kovalchuk-Koval, a more minor diplomat up until now. Having been in the shadow of his predecessor for quite some time, Kovalchuk-Koval is ready to show his face to the world, that face depending on how Matkovsky wants him to appear, anyway.\n\nKnowing his position, Kovalchuk-Koval is much more willing to toe the line than Petlin, not like that is a problem for him. Still, diplomats from across the world will find a stark change in the Far East's diplomatic stance, the Americans especially. It is Kovalchuk-Koval's job to make sure the weapon shipments continue to arrive, and the Vozhd is watching his chief diplomat much closer this time. Kovalchuk-Koval now knows there is always a replacement waiting right behind him.§!"
 MAG_Vladimir_Goltsov_eco: "블라디미르 골초프"
 MAG_Vladimir_Goltsov_eco_desc: "------------\n§LFleeing to Harbin as a youth following his mothers' arrest by the Soviet Union, Vladimir Efimovich Goltsov is as anti-communist as one can be. His firm hatred and beliefs led him to abandon his studies at the Chemical Mining Institute in 1937 to join the Russian Fascist Party. Initially and admirer of Rodzaevsky, he joined Matkovsky's wing instead during the split of the RFP, seeing Rodzaevsky as too much of a Germanophile.\n\nNow a firm follower of Matkovsky, Goltsov is preparing Magadan for the crusade to purify and save Russia. Using his past knowledge from his studies as well as his experiences as a railroad worker, Goltsov now works with the Vozhd closely to develop Magadan into a fulfilling base to carry out their operations to reconquer Russia. However, Goltsov's plans to transform an empty port into a thriving industrial and military hub remains to be seen.§!"

 ### General Descriptions ###
 MILITARY_ROGER_FAULQUES_DESC: "§LKnown worldwide within the mercenary community as the 'Man of a Thousand Lives', Roger Faulques is a man who has fought in near-countless wars - and accumulated almost as many near-life threatening injuries besides.\n\nA former member of French special forces formations, Faulques abandoned what he knew and saw as a power in rapid decline, deciding instead to leverage the skills he had developed in the pursuit of his own fortune and glory. Finding opportunities aplenty in Africa and elsewhere, he soon became known as a skilled and brutal fighter, willing to advance into enemy fire in order to seize victory.\n\nWhen WerBell declared the formation of his state, many were confident it was only a matter of time until Faulques arrived, chasing ever more fame and glory, and this has now come to pass. He is sure to bring tremendous skill and status to the nascent republic, even as many question whether he, in time, intends to replace his new commander in a similar fashion to that before.§!"

 MAG_fascist_splitters_desc: "오래전, 러시아 파시스트당은 러시아의 모든 것을 괴롭히는 내분으로부터 자유로운 단결된 조직이었습니다. 그러나 이 단결은 오래가지 못했습니다. 두 우두머리인 콘스탄틴 로자예프스키와 미하일 마트코프스키를 갈라놓은 교리적 차이는 몇 년 동안, 어쩌면 수십 년 동안 계속해서 끓어올랐습니다. 마트코프스키가 마가단 항구도시를 자신이 이용하기 위해 점령했을 때 마침내 이는 화두에 떠올랐습니다. 그는 자유 러시아, 속박당하지 않은 러시아, 고통과 가난의 사슬에서 해방된 러시아를 약속했습니다. 그의 약속이 지켜질 수 있을진 오직 시간만이 알고 있을 것입니다."

 MAG_DECCAT_economic_development_my_man_matty: "Two-Faced Motherland"
 MAG_DECCAT_economic_development_my_man_matty_desc: "The §MPort of Magadan§! is our window to the world that will allow us to rebuild our economy and stand a fighting chance against the petty fiefdoms in the west as we march to liberate more of Russia from the clutches of warlordism. How we go about this is the subject of heated debate within the party, however.\n\n§nMikhail Matkovsky§! advocates for improving trade links with the OFN. However, he insists on exercising a healthy amount of protectionism while doing so by limiting direct foreign investments to a handful of economic districts arounds Magadan with the intent of preserving a majority of our economy as an All-Russian one. Thus he intends to protect Russian labor and culture deeper in Siberia.\n§gNikolay Petlin§!, for his part, is advocating for more far-reaching ties with the US that would allow American corporations to invest and operate as far as Irkutsk and beyond as we continue to liberate more of Russia from the petty warlords in the west. While this would give us greater access to American money, expertise and resources, it's controversial with the party's right-wing. We must choose wisely, as our economic doctrine going forward will have far-reaching implications for the future of the Russian nation."

 ### Decisions ###
 MAG_DEC_MAT_connect_magadan_with_the_south: "Connect Magadan with the South"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_connect_magadan_with_the_south_desc: "While we may hold one of the most important pieces of strategic infrastructure in Russia, we might as well be landlocked if we can't move anything to or from the city itself. The stretch of the M56 that's supposed to connect Magadan is a dark chapter in our nation's history as this §WRoad of Bones§! marks another chapter of Bolshevik brutality against our people, one made all the worse from the fact that those who died in its construction died to build something that the permafrost made barely functional at the time, and which has largely eroded during the anarchy. We'll correct the errors of the past by repairing the damages done to the road in the recent conflict and use a professional labor force this time."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_amur_highway: "The Magadan-Amur Highway"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_amur_highway_desc: "With our former colleagues in Harbin defeated, we must sadly face the ramifications of the fact that those we once saw as allies were not great stewards of the regions they reigned over. Those that stuck it out with the delusional §WRodzaevsky§! to the very end were like lions led by a paranoid donkey, the state has been driven into disrepair and ruin by their leader's delusions. To the west, Chita bears the scars of a Tsar that didn't want to rule, and the decrepit White Army officers that were incapable of ruling. It's hard to say which is worse of the two, but the worst damage to our economy is the fact that the region's roads are left in ruins. The M58 highway that connects Amur to Chita will be restored to working condition, and it'll be done by the people that neglected it in the first place."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_make_reds_build_baikal_highway: "Make the Reds Rebuild the Baikal Highway"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_make_reds_build_baikal_highway_desc: "Some of the largest cities in Siberia still bear the scars of the Soviet rule, having been the regime's command center after it allowed Russia to fall to the Axis in the Second World War. The neglect and incompetence both Yagoda's reign of terror and the upstart rebels that sought to replace him showed has left the entire M55 road network in disrepair. Just as the Reds have put countless Russians to hard labor for their own nefarious end, we'll return the favor and make them rebuild a piece of what they ruined."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_mexican_trade_agreement: "The Magadan-Mexican Trade Agreement"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_magadan_mexican_trade_agreement_desc: "With our better-than-average ties to the Americas, we are in a position to approach developing nations on the continent for trade deals. As one of our most urgent requirements is food while we have minerals in abundance, we will approach Mexico. We will trade processed ore vital to their production economy at a fair rate. In exchange, we'll get food as well as fertilizers and other products to help us with our own agricultural development."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_golden_opportunities_in_amur: "Golden Opportunities in Amur"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_golden_opportunities_in_amur_desc: "For all his ranting and raving, our old friend Rodzaevsky often resembled a classical caricature of a Jew more than the people he hated: a scheming bastard that put a jackboot to the throat of the Russian people while sitting atop a mountain of gold, yet the bandit didn't even do anything with it. As such, the mines of Amur are both boundless in their potential, and utterly underdeveloped. We'll remedy this by having one of the state's most trusted construction companies take on the task of developing the bountiful gold mines of Amur. In short order, we'll make sure that the gold he didn't know what to do with will benefit the Russian nation and her people."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_magadans_port_facilities: "Expand Magadan's Port Facilities"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_magadans_port_facilities_tp: "All previous Phase 1 decisions must have been completed.\n"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_magadans_port_facilities_desc: "Trade is the lifeblood of our nation, and it's this lifeblood that will allow us to rise above the petty bandit kings in the west. It was our access to foreign food, technology and weapons that allowed us to get back on our feet and reclaim this portion of the Motherland for our people. The §gVozhd§! believes that if we are to move westwards, we must expand Magadan and cultivate our trade ties with the world. With the healthy oversight of the state and its loyal corporations, we'll turn the power of capital into a mighty weapon that'll slay the beasts that have harmed our great nation."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_pmcs_in_magadan: "PMCs in Magadan"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_pmcs_in_magadan_desc: "To call our last experiment with mercenaries a dud would be an understatement. However, the failure was with the hired gun, not the concept itself. With our strengthened status, military power and financial clout we can afford to shop around for more reliable applicants. On top of giving us a small but steady stream of manpower, their superior expertise will give us permanent access to elite ex-officers from various OFN-aligned nations that will train our soldiers, NCOs and officers in modern, Western combat tactics. While controversial given the WerBell incident, every faction seems to find something to like with this setup. The §Jpragmatic Laborists§! see it as a good way to modernize our military, the §MReformists§! support the notion of improving our ties with the West, and the handful of old §WRFP hardliners§! that are still with us are just happy that non-Russians will sent out in front of the enemy machine guns once the war for unification begins anew."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_upgrade_the_irkutsk_hps: "Upgrade the Irkutsk HPS"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_upgrade_the_irkutsk_hps_desc: "While Irkutsk's hydroelectric power station is a marvel of Russian engineering in its own right, our Department of Energy estimates that it will not be able to provide enough to fuel all of our long-term economic plans. Indeed, it has hardly had any proper maintenance work at all during the anarchy due to a lack of spare parts and experienced engineers. If we face the need for energy rations now, then all of Eastern Siberia will go dark the day we try to fully industrialize. By purchasing spare parts from America and bringing in Western-educated engineers to train up a new generation of Russian power plant workers, we'll finally be able to bring the plant back to its full potential."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_stimulate_the_industrial_complex: "Stimulate the Industrial Corporations"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_stimulate_the_industrial_complex_desc: "With our improved access to the outside world comes the obvious benefits of having easier access to industrial equipment. While our landlocked rivals in the west struggle to get their hands on modern machinery as they're surrounded by uncooperative rogue states, our access to the sea changes the situation entirely. With the recent expansion of Magadan's facilities, we're in a good position to import the kind of machinery we need to revitalize our industrial economy with a focus on export products made in Russia, by Russians, using Russian equipment and resources."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_south_american_trade_mission: "South American Trade Mission"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_south_american_trade_mission_desc: "As our economy grows, so does our reach and ability to trade with other developing nations. As our primary friend is America, our most realistic option is to turn to nations such as Brazil to improve our financial situation. We'll trade our minerals for a variety of necessities that we cannot produce on our own here in Russia, ranging from coffee and other luxuries to rubber and strategic resources needed in our heavy industries."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_the_siberian_minning_economy: "The Siberian Mining Economy"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_the_siberian_minning_economy_desc: "Beneath the surface of Siberia lies vast, untapped riches. Coal, gold, diamonds, iron ore and a myriad of valuable minerals are right at our fingertips, but sadly cannot currently be excavated due to many of our mines falling into disrepair during the anarchy. By importing equipment and schematics from abroad, we can undo years of decay in short order."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_free_trade_port_of_magadan: "The Free Trade Port of Magadan"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_free_trade_port_of_magadan_tp: "All previous Phase 2 decisions must have been completed except for 'PMCs in Magadan'.\n"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_free_trade_port_of_magadan_desc: "In the end, it will be the §MReformists§! under Nikolay §gNikolayevich Petlin§! that will decide the economic future of Russia. Instead of looking inward and to our past, we'll look forward and abroad. The American model of free trade has turned their nation into the wealthiest on earth and has greatly enriched their people. Thus, it stands to reason that every true Russian patriot would want to follow that model as well. For what could possibly be a greater break from the destitution of Bolshevism and Tsarist serfdom than a free market capitalist system? And indeed, what could be a greater expression of love for the Russian nation and people than to want them to one day have the highest standard of living on the planet? As such, the port of Magadan shall be expanded once more, and this time turned into a large-scale trade port, one that will allow us to reap the benefits of global free trade."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_all_russian_trade_port_of_magadan: "The All-Russian Trade Port of Magadan"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_all_russian_trade_port_of_magadan_tp: "All previous Phase 2 decisions must have been completed except for 'PMCs in Magadan'.\n"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_all_russian_trade_port_of_magadan_desc: "In the end, it is the §MLaborist§! followers of our beloved §nVozhd Mikhail Alekseevich Matkovsky§! who have won the day. Russia's power does not lie in money, nor can we rely on a foreign system to strengthen us. Our strength lies in our people and our national ethos. While we will trade and seek out good relations with the OFN nations, we will treat them like one would treat a good neighbor and friend rather than something to idolize and emulate. We'll use protectionist policies to protect Russian labor and culture at home and preserve Russian ownership of our corporations and strategic resources, but we'll do so while having the wealth generated by mutually beneficial trade agreements between us strengthen both our nation as well as those that are friendly to Russia and her national interests. As such, the port of Magadan shall be expanded once more, and this time it will become a proper trade port in the service of Russia's national interests."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_corporate_military_investment_program: "Corporate-Military Investment Program"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_corporate_military_investment_program_desc: "A way of safeguarding our national military and economic interests is to expand the role of the corporations in the defense sector. By injecting state funds into the arms industry and providing contracts to loyal Russian companies, we should see a large uptick in military production as well as an overall boost to the employment figures."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_establish_foreign_investment_incentives: "Establish Foreign Investment Incentives"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_establish_foreign_investment_incentives_desc: "While we will exercise a healthy dose of protectionism to safeguard our national interests, autarky and isolationism were never our goals. Based on the earlier works of our Finance Department, we'll set up a program for limited foreign investments into our port cities and set up a series sensible restriction to make sure that the companies that operate there do so within the framework of Russian laws, hire Russian workers and as far as is possible use resources produced in Russia for any production that happens on our soil. Thus we'll meet them halfway: they get a diligent labor force and a lucrative investment climate, we maintain our pledges to the Russian people, and both parties will be richer from it."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_the_energy_sector: "Expand the Energy Sector"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_expand_the_energy_sector_desc: "It's imperative for the continued growth of the Russian nation's economy that we incentivize corporate investments into the energy sector. Exploring ways to increase our excavation of coal from the South Yakutsk basins and petroleum resources in the west will be our next step towards strengthening our nation and making sure that the days of energy rations never return."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_westward_corporate_expansion: "Westwards Corporate Expansion"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_westward_corporate_expansion_tp: "Has reached the super regional stage"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_westward_corporate_expansion_tp_2: "All previous Phase 3 decisons have been completed.\n"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_westward_corporate_expansion_desc: "With our recent victories in the west, it's time to embark on the final leg of our national project. The great expanses of Siberia need to be tamed once more, and leading the charge shall be our corporations. By rapidly integrating the economy of Central Siberia into our Siberian National Republic and their newly liberated peoples into our nation, we'll be one step closer to reclaiming all of Russia."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_coastal_privitization_program: "Coastal Privatization Program"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_coastal_privitization_program_desc: "While the long-term plan is a broader adoption of the American model for our nation, we'll start slowly by allowing for western corporations to move into our coastal provinces. A looser regulatory framework as well as tax incentives will be set up to attract them to come here. While this exercise will mark a sharp turn away from the policies of Matkovsky and will thus likely see some growing pains while our nation adjusts itself to this new, westernized economic model, one oblast at a time."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_an_economic_fortress_against_manchuria: "An Economic Fortress Against Manchuria"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_an_economic_fortress_against_manchuria_desc: "Our rivals in the south not only occupy our lands, but they also pose an economic threat to us. In order to weaken them and mark a clear line in the sand that their influence ends at the border, we'll utilize tax incentives to allow western industrial companies to set up right along the border with Manchuria as a permanent reminder of Russian and American economic might to the Manchu and their Japanese overlords."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_american_investments_into_irkutsk_hps: "American Investments Into Irkutsk HPS"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_american_investments_into_irkutsk_hps_desc: "With our improved access to American scientists and engineers we're in a good position to make the deal to temporarily bring in western exports to restore the Irkutsk HPS into a more long-term deal. We'll allow American companies to invest into the dam and in exchange for a portion of the running profits, we'll gain permanent access to American-educated experts that will make sure that the power station becomes as powerful as the Hoover Dam itself."

 MAG_DEC_MAT_global_free_trade_port_of_magadan_tp_2: "All previous Phase 3 decisons have been completed.\n"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_global_free_trade_port_of_magadan_desc: "From humble beginnings, Magadan has grown from a local port into a busy trade port with a global reach. With investments from American companies soaring and new opportunities rising in the recently liberated west, we must set out to expand the port of Magadan once more and turn it into an international container port. One day, this Russian port will rank among one of the busiest in the world, and its expansion will facilitate the growth of Central Siberia as well."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_great_siberian_highway_project: "The Great Siberian Highway Project"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_great_siberian_highway_project_desc: "The M53 was a planned highway project meant to link Irkutsk with Novosibirsk. Fallen on the wayside due to the outbreak of the Second World War and with its finished sections tarnished by the neglect of the many petty warlords that occupied the areas of land where stretches of this road still existed, it's truly in a sorry state. Our economists believe that with the right investments, we could turn the old vision into reality and link every major city of Central Siberia all the way to our coastal capital. A massive boon to our economy at times of peace, and an equally great benefit to our logistics when the time comes to reclaim the final stretches of Russia from the clutches of the bandit kings in the west."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_siberias_all_russian_mic: "Siberia's All-Russian MIC"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_siberias_all_russian_mic_desc: "Expanding rapidly as the threat of war looms on the horizon once more, the arms corporations of our nations have grown from being a handful of workshops in Magadan into being a massive military industrial complex in its own right. With Russian arms rapidly becoming some of the finest in the world we need to build upon the industries of Novosibirsk, Kemerovo and Krasnoyarsk and establish ourselves as the aspiring military-industrial power of Eurasia. In time, the weapons systems made by the arms corporations of Russia will be seen as some of the best - and most sought after - military systems in the world."
 MAG_DEC_MAT_corporatize_central_siberia: "Corporatize Central Siberia"
 MAG_DEC_MAT_corporatize_central_siberia_desc: "After reclaiming this portion of Russia, it's time that we let our corporations properly establish themselves in the region. By rapidly redistributing former state and private assets into the hands of our corporations, we should be able to economically integrate these oblasts back into our Russian nation, ideally with as little disruption in the lives of the Russian laborer as possible."

With our already flourishing trade relations, it's time to advance beyond everything we've done in the past and further formalize our trade ties with America with a mutual agreement of free trade between our great nations. Soon, American companies will be able to establish themselves in Siberia and "Made In Russia" - By Russian labor - will be a sign of quality for American products. Furthermore their establishment on our soil will bring a large boon to our employment figures as well as our own industries that will be able to benefit from the experience brought about by this close cooperation with America.

 MAG_DEC_MAT_restore_tomsks_universities_desc: "A great culture of learning was established in Tomsk. Unfortunately, what was taught wasn't always what was beneficial to the nation, and furthermore the anarchy of the past and tensions of the present have certainly taken their toll on these educational facilities. All the more reason to inject state funding into them and restore them into working order, making sure that we allocate the extra funds in ways that will also benefit the long-term development of the Russian nation."

 MAG_the_true_heir_of_harbin_desc: "하얼빈에서 존재했던 러시아 파시스트당은 이제 사라졌습니다. 오랫동안 로자예프스키의 정책과 미사여구에 불쾌해하던 마트코프스키와 그의 파벌은 마가단을 장악하고 이제 그들의 목적에 맞게 이를 바꿔나가고 있습니다. 러시아 전체가 고통받는 동안 당은 더 이상 진흙탕 속에서 투쟁하지 않을 것입니다. 더 이상 그 어떤 폭언도,증오의 수사도, 어머니 러시아를 그녀를 파멸로부터 구해주기 위한 우리를 막을 순 없습니다.\n\n그러나 마트코프스키가 조국을 위해 의무를 다하기 전에 그는 제한 없이, 그리고 불성실함으로부터 자유로워진 채 홀로 통치해야 합니다. 그는 자신의 당파를 신뢰하면서도 계급간의 이견을 분쇄해야만 합니다. 로자예프스키에 대한 충성심을 의심하는 사람들은 모두 자신이 숙청된 것임을 알게 될 것입니다. 마가단 보안에 대한 정치적 장악으로 마트코프스키는 그의 신성한 임무를 수행하게 될 것이며, 이는 하얼빈 시절 이래 그가 스스로 굳혀온 것입니다. 그의 지도 아래 러시아는 강하고 유일무이하며 타의 추종을 불허할 것입니다."

 MAG_building_the_wastes_desc: "서쪽에서 오는 공포스런 소식들. 독일의 테러 폭격, 무법자들의 약탈, 러시아인들의 러시아인들에 대한 투쟁. 극동 러시아의 가장자리에서, 마가단은 멀리 떨어져 있고 나머지 조국을 괴롭히는 문제들로부터 보호받고 있습니다. 그러나 거리로 인한 안전에도 불구하고, 마가단은 충분치 않습니다. 인구와 자원 모두에서 러시아의 가장 척박한 지역에 위치하며, 이곳에는 러시아의 궁극적인 해방과 재결합에 쓸만한 것이 별로 없습니다.\n\n마트코프스키는 이를 바꿀것입니다. 그와 그의 일행은 마가단의 십자군원정에 기꺼이 동참하고자 하는 노동자들을 위하여 가단 거리나 교외를 돌아다닙니다. 그들은 도로와 전신주, 작은 작업장, 그리고 제조소를 지을 것입니다. 적들의 실패와 독일인들의 죄악으로 안장된 러시아의 어두운 육체에 해방의 날이 밝아올 때, 그들은 그들의 의무와 헌신으로 충분히 보상받을 수 있을 것입니다. 마트코프스키는 그들의 헌신을 잊지 않을 것이기 때문입니다."

 MAG_siberian_factories: "시베리아 공장"
 MAG_siberian_factories_desc: "마가단은 앞서 지적한 바와 같이 나머지 러시아로부터 멀리 떨어져 있고 고립되어 있습니다. 마가단 항구도시 자체에 현존하는 산업은 규모가 작고 딱히 군수품 생산에 맞춰 있는것은 아닙니다. 과거 극동지역에서는 붉은시대에 발달한 블라디보스토크의 공업 중심지가 있었지만 지금은 일본인과 만주인에게 빼앗겨 이러한 산업력 부족 현상은 곳곳에서 계속되고 있습니다. 간단히 말해서, 동양에서 우리가 싸우는 사람들은 모두 공평한 상황에  놓여 있는 거죠.\n\n그러나 마트코프스키는 어떠한 기회도 그냥 놓치지 않습니다. 당은 마가단의 병사들을 도적때가 아닌 더 높은 이상을 가진 군인으로 무장시키고 훈련시켜야만 합니다. 또한, 당이 보호하는 어떠한 시민도 빈곤과 부족함을 모르게 해야 합니다. 이는 다가올 러시아의 비전이자 모범이 되도록 해야할 것입니다. 이 모든 과제를 해결하기 위해 그는 시베리아의 황무지로부터 애들 싸움 수준의 사소한 갈등이 아닌 전쟁을 위한 분명한 의도를 가지고 공장을 건설해야 합니다."

 MAG_siberian_farms: "시베리아 농장"
 MAG_siberian_farms_desc: "중국의 유명한 전략가가 말했듯이, 군대는 발로 행진하는것이 아니라 뱃속에 든 것으로 행군합니다. 마가단 항구도시는 항상 식량 수요를 충족하기 위해 연방과 제국의 시대에 늘 외부 수입에 의존해 왔습니다. 모국의 다른지역과의 교류가 끊킴에 따라, 그 동안 대부분의 주민들은 해안 어업에 의지해왔습니다. 굶주림 속에서 태어난 그들의 가슴속엔 비밀스러운 소망이 퍼져나갑니다. 그들을 구해줄 러시아가 나타나기를 빌며.\n\n마트코프스키는 당과 함께 그들의 부름에 귀를 기울여야만 합니다. 관리들은 시베리아 들판에서 일할 자원 봉사자들과 징병자들을 모을 것입니다. 극동은 비옥하지 않으나 정직한 러시아인의 노력은 기적을 일으키는덴 충분할 것입니다. 우리는 시베리아의 혹독한 기후에서 살아남아 우리 사람들을 충분히 먹여 살릴 만큼 우리 창고가 넘쳐나는 음식으로 가득 차게 할 필요는 없습니다. 러시아가 다시 일어나면 이 모든 것은 바람 속의 잿더미처럼 잊혀질 것이니까요."

 MAG_try_something_else: "다른것을 시도하다"
 MAG_try_something_else_desc: "시베리아 공장과 농장이 건립되면서 마가단의 당은 행동과 개혁이 가능한 세력으로 자리매김했습니다. 불행하게도, 이러한 행위들은 지금까지 제한적인 성공을 거두었을 뿐입니다. 마트코프스키와 그의 정파가 이를 인정하기는 힘들지만 시간은 이러한 노력의 효과에 대해 말해줄 뿐입니다. 현재로서는 우리는 이를 기다릴 수 밖에 없습니다. 그 사이에 당의 군대엔 문제가 있습니다. 우리 군은 유능하고 비교적 무장도 잘 되어 있는 편이지만 먼 북쪽에서의 전투엔 적합하지 않거나 익숙하지 않습니다.\n\n이제 다른것을 시도해볼 차례입니다. 마트코프스키는 옛 시절의 군인으로서 그의 장군들과 장교들이 군인들을 시베리아의 소란스러운 날씨에 싸울 수 있는 단련되고 경험 많은 사람들의 새로운 군대를 단조하는 것을 관찰할 것입니다. 훈련은 가혹하거나 명확한 조건에서 주기적으로 치뤄질 것입니다. 마가단의 모든 병사는 마트코프스키의 십자군 원정의 창끝이 되어야만 합니다."

 MAG_acquire_advisors: "조언자를 확보"
 MAG_acquire_advisors_desc: "시베리아의 대지는 오래된 역사를 가지고 있습니다. 과거 수세기 동안 제국이 동쪽으로 급속히 팽창하던 시기 이전부터 여러 민족이 이곳에 거주하면서 혹독한 날씨를 견디고 생계를 꾸려왔죠. 마가단의 군은 그들로부터 배울 것이 많으며 야생에서 살아남는 법에 대한 조언은 극동의 변덕스런 환경속에서 삶과 죽음의 차이를 나눌 수 있습니다.\n\n이 조언자들을 얻기 위해, 일부 병력은 지역 통역관과 함께 캄차카 주변의 땅으로 북상할 것입니다. 그곳에서 우리는 원주민들과 접촉할 것입니다. 그들의 수천 년의 경험을 우리 자신의 전쟁 이론의 발전을 돕는 데 사용할 수 있기를 바라면서 말이죠. 그들은 더 이상 시베리아의 야생속에서 이빨과 가죽만으로 살아남진 못할 것입니다. 이제부터 그들은 극동 땅의 신들로부터 내려지는 의심도 우려도 무시하고 지낼 수 있을것입니다. 우리는 우리의 군인들을 생존가이자 승자로 만들 것입니다!"

 MAG_radical_techniques: "급진적 기법"
 MAG_radical_techniques_desc: "극동은 정말 야생적인 땅입니다. 연방과 제국 시대에도 희소한 거주민들의 러시아의 동쪽 확장을 지탱할 문명이 없는 삶은 도전적이고 끊임없는 삶이었습니다. 시베리아의 숲과 툰드라에서는 전쟁은 더 서쪽에서의 특징을 띠지 않습니다. 이렇다 할 인프라가 없는 상황 속에서 이곳의 전쟁은 극동을 지배하기 위해 싸우는 소국들간의 교전으로 축소되었습니다. 시베리아에서 정상에 오른다는 것은 유럽에서 가르치는 일반적인 전쟁의 법칙을 포기하는 것을 의미할 것입니다.\n\n우리의 대의를 위해서, 우리는 우리가 알고 있는 모든 것을 뒤로 해야만 합니다. 결국 전쟁의 방식은 시대에 맞게 바뀌는 법이니까요. 우리 병사들은 시베리아 원주민들로부터 배운 교훈을 바탕으로 급진적인 새로운 훈련 체제를 도입하게 될 것입니다. 베리아의 숲과 툰드라는 우리에게 곧 서러시아의 평야와 들판과 같을 것이며, 그것이 로자예프스키든, 황제파든, 심지어 적군이 될 지라도 우리의 공격하는 것을 막을 장애물 따윈 없을 것입니다."

 MAG_preliminary_arming: "예비 무장"
 MAG_preliminary_arming_desc: "우리가 건설한 시베리아 공장들이 결실을 볼 때가 마침내 왔습니다. 일터와 기계를 충분히 활용 할 수 있는 충분한 인력이 있으므로 그들은 의도한 대로 가동하기 시작할 수 있습니다. 마가단 거리에서는 이 공장들의 굴뚝들이 연기를 뿜어내는 것을 볼 수 있는데, 이는 그들이 그 안에서 만들어 내는 것들을 암시합니다. 소총,유니폼,탄환, 포와 포탄조차 그 안에 도사리고 있습니다. 당은 가장 절박한 상황에서 다시금 승리를 거두었고, 마트코프스키는 기뻐하고 있습니다.\n\n이제 당의 무장세력을 무장시킬 때입니다. 적절한 장비를 갖추기만 한다면 우리 병사들은 그렇게 과소평가한 실수에도 불구하고 훨씬 더 큰 힘으로 적군이나 차르주의자, 또는 로자예프스키와 싸우기 위해 나설 수 있을 것입니다. 이러한 이점은 마트코프스키가 조국을 고통과 불화의 손아귀에서 해방시키기 위한 십자군원정을 위해 박차를 가하는 것처럼 극동을 통일할 기회를 우리에게 제공할 것입니다."

 MAG_winterized_gear: "동계대비 장비"
 MAG_winterized_gear_desc: "극동의 불우할 수 있는 모든 상황 중에서 가장 두드러지는 것은 추위입니다. 혹독한 시베리아 겨울 동안 움직이는 것은 힘들고 그 안에서 싸우는 것은 더더욱 힘이 듭니다. 설상가상으로 현재 우리 군인들이 사용하고 있는 장비들은 혹독한 날씨에 자주 고장 나거나 아니면 쓸모가 없는 것들 뿐입니다. 월동여건이 부대의 최우선 과제인 만큼 우린 해결책을 찾아야만 합니다. 또한 시베리아 겨울을 위해 더 많은 내구성을 갖춘 장비를 획득하는 것은 우리 병사들로 하여금 적들보다 결정적으로 유리한 위치에 설 수 있게 해줄 것입니다.\n\n마트코프스키는 모든 군사장비를 동계화하도록 명령할 것입니다. 대부분의 장비가 저온에서 사용될 준비가 되어 있지 않기 때문에 이것은 길고 난감한 과정이 될 것입니다. 하지만, 이것은 우리가 견뎌내야 할 투쟁입니다. 궁극적으로 러시아의 해방은 우리가 가진 모든 것을 쏟아부어야 하는 것이며, 이 작은 불편은 그 도전에 비하면 아무것도 아닙니다. 언젠가 마트코프스키가 러시아를 통치할 때, 이 모든 것들은 그 가치를 증명할 것입니다."

 MAG_sitting_out_the_winter: "겨울이 끝나길 기다리다"
 MAG_sitting_out_the_winter_desc: "우리는 우리가 할 수 있는 모든 것을 했습니다. 공장과 농장은 끊임없이 가동하고 있고 그 생산물들은 군인들과 시민들에게 공평하게 배분되고 있습니다. 원주민 참모들은 전투의 효율성을 유지하면서 극동 기후에서 살아남을 수 있는 단련된 병사들을 훈련시켰습니다. 동계대비 명령이 완료됬고,우리 제조 공장에서 생산한 장비들은 이제 저온에서도 작동이 가능합니다. 우리는 행동할 준비가 되었지만 겨울이 다가오고 있습니다.\n\n자연의 힘에 대항하여 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 많지 않습니다. 우리는 겨울을 버티고 전봇대와 도로의 정비를 위해 병사들을 배치해야만 합니다. 마트코프스키의 영토가 범죄와 도적질로부터 자유로울 수 있도록 순찰은 여전히 이루어질 것이지만, 전투 훈련은 이루어지지 않을 것입니다. 모든 병력이 평상시처럼 행동하며, 날씨에 맞게 적응해 있습니다. 그것이 끝날때 우리 모두를 기다리는 거대한 임무가 있고, 마트코프스키는 이를 영도하기 위해 서 있을 것입니다."

 MAG_desperate_times: "절박한 시간"
 MAG_desperate_times_desc: "우리가 해낸 모든 일에도 불구하고, 기어코 이 지경이 오고야 말았습니다. 우리의 식량은 바닥을 들어내고 있고 우리의 겨울 장비는 겨울바람속에 간신히 작동하며 우리의 농장과 공장은 비효율적입니다. 겨울은 왔다 가겠지만 혹독한 시베리아 환경 속에서 영역을 안정시키고 힘을 얻으려는 우리의 노력에 큰 발자취를 남겼습니다. 아마도 마트코프스키의 외세와 망명자들이 러시아에서 그의 대의명분을 지원하도록 하는 계획을 이용해 밖을 내다볼 때가 된 것 같습니다.\n\n우리는 나아갈 수 있는 세 가지 방향을 지니고 있습니다. 치타에 거주하는 차르는 기껏해야 우리의 시답지않은 적이지만, 어쩌면 그의 패거리에게 휴전을 받아들이도록 설득할 수 있을지도 모릅니다. 닉슨 대통령 밑의 미국인들은 우리가 그들에게 개혁을 약속한다면 우리를 지지해줄 지도 모릅니다. 마지막으로, 영향력 있는 가장 두드러진 러시아인 망명자인 파시스트 아나스타시 본시아츠키가 우리의 대의를 뒤에 있는 그들의 자원을 통해 지원 하도록 설득할 수 있을지 모릅니다. 우리가 누구를 설득해서 우리를 지지하도록 하든지 간에 한 가지는 분명합니다. 당은 홀로 살아남을 수 없을 것입니다."

 MAG_the_tsar_desc: "로자예프스키의 비열한 군대에 의해 우리 영역에서 간신히 분리되었지만, 치타는 다른 군벌 국가들보다 우리와 공통점이 더 많습니다. 하얼빈에 나타난 다양한 망명자 운동과 조직의 진화속에서, 이 정권은 파시즘이 아니라 차르주의에 기반을 두고 있습니다. 몇몇 백군 장군 일당은 로마노프가문의 후예이자 왕위 계승자로서의 정통성이 거의 없는 자인 마이클 안드리비치를 끌어들여 야고다 제국이 무너지는동안 그 제국의 일부를 차지하여 치타를 건설했습니다.\n\n우리는 이데올로기와 공통된 적을 포함해 많은 공통점을 공유하고 있으며, 미하일은 지금으로서는 협력하고 더 긴밀한 관계를 맺기를 간절히 바라는 것 같습니다. 육로로 연결되지 않아 교류가 어려울 수도 있지만 그렇다고 치타에 있는 새 친구들과의 접촉이 중단되지는 않을 것입니다."

 MAG_smuggling_routes_desc: "차르 미하일의 군벌과 상호 이익이 되는 관계에 도달하는 데 있어서 가장 큰 문제는 우리가 어떻게 그들에게 도달하느냐는 문제에 대한 해답을 찾는 것이었지만 우리는 해결책을 찾아냈습니다.\n\n이곳 극동지역에서는 정착지와 그 사이의 교류의 연결고리가 될 경로가 거의 없다는 것은 잘 알려진 사실입니다. 이는 우리의 경로와 일정을 신중하고 면밀하게 검토한다면,비밀 수단을 통해 우리를 실질적으로 치타와 연결할 수 있는 경로나 그 중 몇 가지라도 만들 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 우리의 최고의 병사들이 지키고 있는 이 길들은 양방향으로 가는 무기와 자원의 흐름을,더 나아가면 우리 주 사이에 있는 특사의 호송까지도 가능하게 할 것입니다. 만일 우리가 치타에서 가져오고 싶은 것은 무엇이든 밀반입할 수 있다면 그것은 지리를 극복하고 외교관계를 수립하는 좋은 첫걸음이 될 것입니다."

 MAG_put_aside_our_differences: "우리의 차이점은 제쳐두자"
 MAG_put_aside_our_differences_desc: "우리와 치타의 차르주의자들은 공통점이 많지만, 의견 차이도 많습니다. 우리는 공통된 출신배경을 가지고 있지만 그들이 차르 제국의 옛 방식을 추구하여 그들의 뿌리를 찾는 동안 우리의 이데올로기는 러시아 파시즘의 새롭고 신선한 운동에서 비롯됩니다. 물론 우리를 갈라놓는 것은 군주의 권력에 기대있는 옛 러시아 장군들과 정치인들의 낡아빠진 신념 때문이지만 그렇다고 해서 이 비참한 환경에서 화해가 불가능해지는 것은 아닙니다.\n\n공동의 적,로자예프스키의 파시스트 일당과 맞서기 위해, 우리는 그들과 협력과 불가침의 협정을 제안함으로써 치타에 대한 우정과 존경을 보여주는 조치를 취할 것입니다. 만약 그들이 받아들인다면, 우리는 더 안전하게 아무르를 공격할 기회도 얻을 수 있을 것입니다."

Now that the split in the party has been mended and our rule has been secured, we are ready to look beyond inner-party squabbles to the rest of the Far Eastern region. In our absence, many powers have seized territory for themselves: the Tsarists in Chita, the regional republic of Yakutia and last but not least the traitorous Bolsheviks in Irkutsk and Buryatia.\n\nHow unlucky for them then, that the party is now one, with a sole head helming it. We will form a united front, one that we have not made with our brothers in Amur for years, to roll back the warlords of the Far East and establish ourselves as the single legitimate representative of a Russian state there. The Crusade begins here, and from here on out, there is nowhere for us to go but up."

 MAG_altering_the_deal: "거래 변경"
 MAG_altering_the_deal_desc: "During the times of harsh winters, we formed a temporary truce with the Tsarists to work against Rodzaevsky. Before that, during the years of Union's collapse, we united with them to create the Anti-Bolshevik Front. The alliance was successful, up to a point; the Front fell into in-fighting, with the Tsarists splitting away and taking charge of Chita, led by the late Semyonov. Meanwhile, the RFP became entrenched in Magadan and Amur, before undergoing its own split.\n\nNow that the party has sorted its struggle and ended the division, it is ready to turn to the outside world. The Tsarists in Chita seem to be the most appropriate targets for the start of our expansion. Having worked with them, we know their strengths and weaknesses, giving us an upper hand in a hypothetical conflict between the monarchists and the party. We shall alter the deal; either they serve us, or die in defiance. There can be only one leader, and that is Matkovsky."

 MAG_integrate_the_high_command_desc: "As has been previously established, in the immediate aftermath of the Union's collapse, the monarchists formed a pact with the RFP, creating the Anti-Bolshevik Front. The operations were successful, up to a point. Eventually the offensive ground to a halt before the east could be unified, and the members of the Front went their separate ways. Semyonov took his section of the line near Chita and set up camp there, waiting for the day that the Tsar ruled over Russia once again. He would not live to see his efforts fail.\n\nMonarchism aside, the officer corps of the Tsarists mainly hold the same ideas as Matkovsky and the RFP. With these ideologically compatible allies, it would be a waste to send their talents to the gallows. Instead, we should integrate them and give them a place alongside us, marching together towards the final liberation of Russia. Perhaps then they will finally see that a crowned head does not a great Russia make."

A scion of House Romanov, his father's non-dynastic marriage to his mother made sure that no claim would ever pass through his blood. The Tsarists officers however, desperate for any claimants to the throne, sent out invitations across the world, an invitation that only Mikhail accepted. Semyonov then detained him against his will, keeping him in a nation he had no desire to rule.\n\nThe RFP has defeated the Tsarists, scattering them in the four winds of the Far East. Yet, remaining in the palace of Chita is the beloved tsar, abandoned by his loyal and trusted followers. Matkovsky must choose what to do with him. Allowing him to live may be the merciful option, given how harsh his life up to this point has been. Yet death is the only way to ensure that there will be no loose ends left, and leaving him alive may not be worth the risk."

He looks past sins of the Tsarists, their rebellion and violent separation from the Party. Even the recent war against the monarchists can be forgiven: let us all work together again, like the good times in Harbin.\n\nThe Anti-Bolshevik Front has reunited. The branches of the RFP in Magadan and Amur have reconciled their differences, and the officers Chita have returned to the fold. There will be no more disunity.

Matkovsky, however, has done the impossible: the Front stands again, and before it is an old enemy. This time, we shall not fail.\n\nWe march north. With the Reds in disarray after their civil war, Yakutia will have no protection against the wrath of the rejuvenated Front. What few soldiers the diamond mines of Yakutia can buy, we will overwhelm, we will throw against the rocks and shatter.

Matkovsky, disgusted by what he discovered, vows to end this practice all over Yakutia. There is a small problem as to who will manage the mining operations if the party incorporates Yakut corporations to the state. Fortunately, Matkovsky has a simple solution to this predicament.\n\nRussian corporations shall work in Yakutia. No longer shall Russian labor go to any nation other than their own. The diamonds of these mines will go toward funding the party and its sacred task. With a surplus of funds resulting from the increased trade, we will be able to draw more to join us and pay those in our service higher wages. Russians shall rule over Russia again."

Perhaps the Wizard of Whispering Death can still aid us after his unceremonious and violent dismissal after all.\n\nFrom the ex-mercenary captives that we gained during WerBell's coup, we can learn how WerBell organizes his forces into a coherent, capable fighting force. We shall present the mercenaries more lenient terms if they cooperate with us to raise our troops to their standards, using their experience in global wars and applying it to Siberia. The soldiers of Magadan shall become the greatest in the Far East, perhaps in the whole of Russia. No army, in Siberia or elsewhere, shall challenge their superiority."

Now that they have seen the results that the Vozhd has brought to the Far East, their faith in our regime has increased, and the shipments of supplies have become more significant as of late, with not only surplus arms but recent, state-of-the-art ones as well.\n\nThe Americans shall not only receive empty promises to pay for their aid. We will begin paying from our pocket to this foreign power, proving that the Russians can finally stand alone on their own two feet.

At this juncture, the party cannot let itself be blindsided by any developments in the Far East.\n\nTo make up for the lack of intelligence on our foes, the Vozhd has approved for the construction of forward operating bases in the periphery of our territories. From there, no change shall miss the party's eye in Magadan. Knowing oneself is only half the fight won; to ensure one's total and complete victory, one must understand the enemy as well.

It would be complacent for us to wait and sit on our medals while the rest of the Far East has not pledged oaths of loyalty to the one true Vozhd. The military exercises will continue, and the mining of diamonds will not cease. The Far East is in our hands, waiting to be grasped and claimed.

These claimants are shaped by ideological fanaticism, rather than the mere will to survive in the Siberian climate.\n\nThe Reds are to our west, in Buryatia and Irkutsk. Some in the general staff want to prioritize them first, seeing as they are our old enemies and hardened by years of war. Some, however, look to the north and see the Father as the greater threat: after all, faith has driven men to commit all things great and terrible.

Abandoning its roots, it instead fled to the ideals of Marx and Lenin, creating a state whose only purpose was material gain. Gone was the Russia that championed the rights of its people, replaced by a wicked country that actively suppressed freedom. Where did all their cruelty lead them? They guided Russia to its defeat at the hand of the most heinous enemy.\n\nIt is now time for us to snuff out the flames of the Revolution. The troops shall move like boots over the embers of the Reds. When the Vozhd gives his order, they shall stamp these out. No one shall gain from their ashes kindling from which to light the whole of Russia aflame again. We do not care whether or not it is Yagoda or Sablin who we face: the Reds has had their chance, and they have squandered it. It is time for someone else to lead Russia to her glory."

However, the Vozhd does not care about the ramblings of a mad dog of the ancient Soviet government. He is sitting on the Vozhd's rightful territory, and therefore he stands in the party's way. Whether or not his case is valid is irrelevant; he shall fall, and the people will be freed from his deceit.\n\nWe shall break the remnants of our nemesis. Our men, the most skilled and elite in the Far East by far, shall fall on these supposed Guardians of the Revolution. Their blood shall stain the battlefields of Siberia and wash away the crimes of their shadowy, repressive regime. From the soil shall rise a new Russia, led by our Vozhd!

Matkovsky plans to use them as an inspiration for his own intelligence service, but also as a lesson. The crimes against the freedom and liberty of the Russian people shall no longer be tolerated.\n\nThis vision is the impetus for the State Intelligence Agency: a body consisting of spies, commissars, and secret police, whose task is to investigate dissent and monitor the enemy. The Party shall merge our separate investigative agencies into the SIA. We will infiltrate our enemies to the west and the north. They will be unable to move an inch without us knowing. The eyes of Matkovsky shall also not overlook his own realm either. There will be no more dissent, and never another Rodzaevsky."

After the fall of the Union, these manufactories shut down, as the Reds were more concerned about their ideological purity than the utility of such tools of the state. We now possess the region of Irkutsk and the aircraft industry with it.\n\nIt is time for us to do what the Reds have failed to. We shall reopen these factories, and let the workers from all over the Far East into them. Soon, the Anti-Bolshevik Front will not only battle its enemies on the ground but in the sky as well. Against the other powers of Siberia, this might prove to be the decisive edge that will let us triumph over them.

His radio broadcasts breach our airwaves every day and night, urging our soldiers to abandon the Vozhd and join what he called a return to the ideas of Lenin. It would be lying to say that none of our soldiers switched sides, but for the most part, his speeches have gained no purchase in the army.\n\nMatkovsky views Sablin with slightly better regard than Yagoda. At least Sablin recognizes that his government has gone the wrong way. However, he did not come to the truth that the Soviet system was at fault for the defeat and suffering of the Russian people. We shall march against Buryatia and silence the radio broadcasts. No longer shall ideas of long-dead men guide Russia to ruin."

Now his loyal followers scatter to the Siberian forests and hills, perhaps never to return. He now dwells in a jail cell in Magadan, along with those either too faithful or too slow to escape his fate.\n\nThe party shall put his ideas to rest. The doctrines of the past shall not plague the people of Russia ever again. The question remains as to what to do with Sablin and his retainers. The Vozhd shall deal with Sablin personally, believing him worthy of respect. He shall exile Sablin to the wilds of Siberia, blindfolded.

The Reds, though they were our enemies to the end, desired only good for Russia. That they lay dead, strewn over the fields of Siberia, does not impede their honor, and Matkovsky shall honor them.\n\nNo longer shall his rule be from top to bottom, commanding everything without a grasp on the the average Russian citizen's perspective. He shall become the People's Vozhd, a leader who rules with the popular consent of his people. In keeping with the wishes of his enemies, Russia shall not know lack, ever again.

Aldan is small, and by itself, it garners no concern save for the gold mine they possess.\n\nThe single line of defense in Aldan consists of militiamen and Siberian mercenaries paid their weight in gold. A campaign into Aldan would be simple, and our armies will have no trouble handling them. The question is not of ease, but of speed.

Aldan, however, is a sparsely-populated region. To bring the gold mines up to their full potential, we would need to take some measures.\n\nThe Vozhd shall send some of his labor force to the northern mines of Aldan, using gold to incentivize settlers to go there. Once up and running, gold will pour out of these mines, to finance the war effort in the Far East. With the excess revenue brought in by the ore, we can afford a bigger army. However, we shall not make the same mistakes that Aldan did; all shall swear loyalty to the Vozhd and him alone."

 MAG_operation_heretic_desc: "Other than the Reds, the other regional contender to power is the Father in the north. Rallying the native Siberians to his side, and enthralling him with his ideology of anarchism, he has risen. This heretic, manipulating the holy and sacred verses of the Bible to suit his ends, shall not remain long. If for no other reason, we face the Father because he stands against all that Russia is: a holy man perverting the teachings of Christ to birth a new, doomed society.\n\nWe shall strike this apparition of Satan down from his throne. The faith of the peasant militias and dissidents shall matter little in front of an artillery barrage. We shall charge forward, anointed by the Lord, bearing the lance that strikes the beast of deceit down. The heavens above bless our Vozhd else he would not have come this far. Let the Lord decide who he favors in the field of battle: his chosen shall triumph."

 MAG_protectors_of_the_faith_desc: "Across all of Russia, the importance of faith is apparent. The Bolsheviks tried to suppress it, and the tsars attempted to make it subservient to their wills. The mysterious Father, whose identity is Alexander Men, is now experimenting with the application of faith in everyday life. The false apostle himself has appeared in front of the poor, innocent Siberian folk, claiming that his way forward can bring to them a future they so desperately desire. Before his act of war against us, he unjustly baptized many to the faith, ignoring the precepts of Orthodoxy and the foundations that Christ had laid a millennia ago.\n\nThus shall we go out, charging with the wind hard against our faces, victory assured by the sign God has given us. We shall strike down the heretic, and topple the idols to his own excess. We shall save the faith, and with it, Russia."

 MAG_church_support_desc: "The root of the Father's strategy of warfare lies in his rhetoric. Blessed with a silver tongue by Satan himself, the madman has gone up and down Northern Siberia, gathering more and more followers willing to abandon reason and bring forth the devil incarnate upon this world. We are trying our best to stop his heresy in its tracks, but his words have spread like wildfire on the untouched forests of Siberian native minds. We should seek help in defeating this menace, once and for all.\n\nWe shall fight fire with fire. The Far Eastern Orthodox Church, although not in close communion with the churches in other parts of Russia, is still a potent ally. After all, deceit cannot silence the truth. We shall seek their support: their endorsement of our cause on the terms of faith. They shall send out missionaries to bring back these prodigal children back to the fold. We shall take from the devil his weapons, and we shall destroy him."

 MAG_advanced_tactics_desc: "The army of the heretic does not, at first glance, seem impressive. Comprised of untrained peasants and woodsmen from the northern parts of Siberia, they make for an unorthodox force. However, they hold a distinct advantage over us. The harsh and unforgiving terrain of Siberia favors them: they know the lay of the land, its highs and lows, where it is ragged and wherever it is smooth. Their large numbers also mean that they can exploit the gaps within our lines effectively, isolating active combat units and swamping them with a relentless assault of bodies.\n\nWe need to fight smarter. Our troops are superior, but we need to find a new way to use them. We shall not give ground to them anymore. We shall study their patterns of attack and their weaknesses. We shall strike where they are not aware and claim victory in surprise. Their vast numbers shall not stop us. We shall push through, and Russia awaits."

 MAG_win_the_peasants_over_desc: "We have sworn to protect the faith and earned the support of the Church. The Father's substantial numbers still constitute a significant problem for us, but with our tactics, they are surmountable. Yet, we have not done anything to weaken the primary support that props up the false prophet and his followers. The Father is widely popular among the Siberian tribes, and their faith in him fuels their war effort. We cannot defeat him without the backing of the tribes.\n\nWe can rectify this immediately. We shall turn our broadcasts in the direction of the tribes while distributing free radios among the populace. We will send infiltration squads deep into their territory, and we shall give out food and provisions, and they shall thank the generous Vozhd for his hospitality. Their hearts and minds shall be ours, and without his people to propel him into victory, the devil's apostle shall crumble in our wake."

 MAG_sins_of_the_father_desc: "The peasants are pleased. The church and its clergy are now under our protection, while they have thrown their weight behind us, legitimizing the Vozhd's mission. In cases where the peasants attempt to wage guerilla warfare in the Siberian wilds, we are ready to respond with our own twist to their doctrines. Little do the peasants know, however, that their beloved Father, formerly of their parish, is still alive.\n\nThe Vozhd must decide what to do with him. Letting him loose into Siberia may once again result in the peasants rising and rebelling against our stranglehold in the Far East. For this predicament, we shall excommunicate him and damn his memory forever. There was never a Father; it was a disorganized rebellion who rose against Matkovsky's rightful rule over the Far East. Those who know the truth shall exist, but none shall ever hear of the Father's teachings ever again. It is time to subsume the truth for our purposes."

The Reds are gone: Yagoda shot and killed, Sablin in exile. No one remembers the Father and his teachings, and those who do fight a pointless and grueling guerilla war in the far reaches of the Russian Far East. No one stands to challenge the might of the RFP and its Vozhd. However, there is still something to do.\n\nTo reassure the peoples of Siberia and the west of our intentions, as well as to curry favor with the Americans, our Vozhd has come up with a grand, almost-liberal seeming notion: the Charter of Magadan. We will outline and implement the rights we promised years ago in the Siberian Bill of Rights. All people of the Far East can rest easy, knowing that the RFP shields and guarantees their rights. This is only a taste of what's to come for the rest of Russia."

Under his rule, Magadan has secured itself as a major power player in Russia.\n\nHowever, these new lands we've conquered are disparate and rather loosely connected, both administratively and politically, compared to the rest of the nation. We should endeavor to further consolidate these various new territories in order to bring a real sense of unity to the nation and more effectively stamp out rebel movements, wherever they may arise. We will make sure the people of our nation know who is ruling over them."

A party congress is to be called, and the newly created Russian National Labor Party, formerly known as the Russian Fascist Party, is to determine what kinds of reforms and changes to our government's political structure need to be made.\n\nThe Vozhd has indicated a willingness to compromise on his ideals in order to secure a more stable and functional state for him to govern over. We should take this into consideration as we endeavor to improve the government."

However, given the current political climate, having such dissidents executed wouldn't be ideal. Instead, the FNCF, or Dalstroy, will be created.\n\nPublically, it's a work program to improve infrastructure, construction and resource extraction. In reality, it will be a series of forced labor camps where the aforementioned political opponents and dissidents will be incarcerated. Truly a more civilized way of handling such people."

In reality, our Vozhd, Matkovsky, still maintains a tight grip over the party.\n\nHowever, one seismic shift in our national politics has taken place since the party congress. The party has split into multiple separate wings, with the Laborists under Matkovsky, Reformists under the foreign minister Nikolay Petlin, and the Old Guard who have yet to put forward a leader. In time, these factions may even form the basis of new political parties."

They are to be Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Education, Police and Justice, Defense, Public Economy, and Labor.\n\nThe chief ministers of these seven ministries will be appointed by the Vozhd and obliged to follow his direction.

Though times have changed significantly since the first Zemsky Sobor, the need of a ruler for assistance has not.\n\nAt the urging of Petlin's Reformist wing, the Grand Sobor, or grand assembly, is to be established and act as a parliament for the Vozhd, similarly advising him and helping him to administer the Far East, just as its predecessor did so many centuries ago."
 
 MAG_a_federalist_model: "연방주의자 모델"
 MAG_a_federalist_model_desc: "As we debate over how to administrate a landmass as large as Russia, we would be remiss not to consider the federalist model. The advantages of a federal form of government are numerous. For example, by allowing each individual province or territory some amount of autonomy and independence from the federal government, we allow for more personalized policy to be created for each region.\n\nAdditionally, such a system encourages political participation from our citizens and reduces overall administrative strain on the national government. Though it might weaken the Vozhd's power, it may also help secure his rule."

 MAG_by_the_will_of_the_vozhd_desc: "The Vozhd didn't rise to supreme power in the nation by simply waltzing in and finding the largest desk to sit at. It took years of work, political knowledge, and wisdom to be able to get to where he is today.\n\nThe Vozhd has little need of the assistance of lesser men, especially those who were incapable of coming to power themselves. No, only the will and authority of Matkovsky is needed in these lands. The suggestion that he would even need such assistance is foolish, and an idea to be abandoned."
 
 MAG_one_nation_under_god: "신 아래 한 국가"
 MAG_one_nation_under_god_desc: "Even contemplating rule by any other authority than the Vozhd himself is tantamount to treason. A federal government would do nothing but foster separatist sentiments and hinder the efficiency that a single overall government offers.\n\nGiven that many of the territories we have in our nation were previously self governing and at war with us at some point, it's probable that the people might harbor grudges and elect officials hostile to our rule. Such a security risk could end up crippling the nation down the line should those local administrations ever choose to secede. No, the state will remain centralized."

We have endured hardship unparalleled at the hands of the German menace, that monster which bent Europe to its will and broke all the empires living on the continent. It was only us, the Russians, who got back up and mobilized to fight the Reich once more. We alone fought on, without aid and without respite.\n\nEven in defeat, we managed to strike a crippling blow against the Nazi giant, destroying its economy and exposing its weaknesses to the world. The Russian people remain strong, even through these decades of humiliation and loss. Under our Vozhd's leadership the world will see our strength."

From the Kazakhs in Central Asia to the Ukranians in the Eastern Europe, our nation was accommodating to everyone. If we are to one day reunite Russia and take our place as masters in both Europe and Asia, our nation too must be open to peoples of all creeds and nationalities, just like our friends across the Atlantic in the United States. We should begin reforming our immigration laws and letting begin bringing in more foreign workers into the country."

If the free market has the power to transform an agrarian backwater like the United States into an industrial superpower capable of exporting its influence across the world, we can certainly utilize it to transform our nation from a cold eastern outcropping to the industrial trade center of Russia.\n\nWe should begin deregulating the economy and opening up more sectors of the economy for the private sector to seize on. Ours will be a Russia where every man is entitled to the sweat of their own brow."

 MAG_return_to_harbin_desc: "Although the Russian Fascist Party wasn't as modern or progressive as our Russian National Labor Party, it did great things for our nation and Russia as a whole while it was active. Additionally, though they had their flaws, if nothing else, the fascists of the Russian Fascist Party loved Russia and the Russian people.\n\nWe would be remiss if we were to blindly reject the methods and means through which the party brought our nation to greatness. Instead of looking to countries like the United States for inspiration, we should stick to what's been successful for us and pursue the dream of a reunified Russia our own way."
 
 MAG_the_manifesto_of_national_labor: "국민노동선언"
 MAG_the_manifesto_of_national_labor_desc: "Recently, our Vozhd, Matkovsky, penned a political manifesto, one which will surely be shared in the highest halls of power across the world, on his new ideology of National Syndicalism. The manifesto, divided into four sections, describes the movement's several objectives in political, social, military and financial fields.\n\nSuch objectives include universal suffrage, the nationalization of the armaments industry, reorganization of the railway and transportation sector, and reduction of the retirement age from 65 to 55. Some have drawn parallels between our Vozhd's work and other similar manifestos from the 1930s, however they are simply failing to recognize our leader's inherent greatness."

Our borders are cleaner and easier to defend, we've managed to take hold of the entirety of the Far East, and our military has never been stronger. However, in many more arguably important ways, the nation is far more unstable than it ever was before.\n\nWe are struggling to administer an area and population far larger than our government was originally intended to administrate, ideological rebels are popping up all over the place, and loyalty to the Vozhd is becoming ever more nebulous and unreliable. There are several means through which we could address these issues, whether it be through political changes or just by directly dealing with the dissent.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must work to implement the changes quickly in order to maintain the stability of our state."
 
 MAG_reform_the_blackshirts: "흑색셔츠단을 개혁하다"
 MAG_reform_the_blackshirts_desc: "The Blackshirts as an organization have been widely condemned as violent thugs and enforces nationwide, with many calling for its abolishment. The Vozhd would never agree to such a radical measure like that, but he may agree to reform the Blackshirts into something else. They have a large manpower pool, have experience with enforcing and handling violence, have decent recruitment standards, and have offices and locations nationwide.\n\nThe answer is clear; we should reform the Blackshirts organization into a police force. Everything else is there, with a few adjustments to leadership and operating standards, we could begin policing the nation with a legitimate and competent police force within just a few weeks."

Given that Matkovsky was the leader of our nation and political party, he took credit for it and insisted on putting as many adjustments to the bill as possible to ensure that the Vozhd's power in government wouldn't be significantly affected.\n\nThough our Vozhd has done a great many things for the country, it might be best to allow Petlin to improve on the Bill through his political maneuverings and get rid of those loopholes. What Matkovksy doesn't know won't hurt him."

From now on, the State Intelligence Agency will be given far more leeway in dealing with dissent.\n\nThe SIA will be given carte blanche to go after whoever is deemed to be a threat to the government and dispatched by any means determined necessary. These dissidents will either learn how to get along as part of our country and political system or be forcefully taught how by the SIA."

This new reform is to bring our National Republic in line with other major nations like Germany, Japan, and the United States.\n\nThe executive offices of power in their government, the Führer, Emperor, and President, all have veto power in their governments, and can shoot down policy and proposals deemed harmful to the country. We would only be following in the footsteps of these larger, more successful nations implementing our own form of veto power."

 MAG_subsidize_radio_free_magadan_desc: "A number of years back, Radio Free Magadan broadcasted live shows and news bulletins for all the nation. Unfortunately, as times got tougher, the government could no longer afford to keep the service running. Not only was it draining government funds, but it was also determined to be of negligible utility, as most in Magadan at the time didn't even own radios.\n\nTimes have changed now, and Magadan is more prosperous than it once was. More people have radios and the government has more money. It could be beneficial for us to restart the radio service, this time more strictly under government control."

This council will advise and weigh in on government policy, helping us steer our policy in such a direction that will benefit the economy overalls. The members of these groups will be elected from coalitions of companies and corporations that work in any particular industry.\n\nFor example, the mining industry will have its own representative, as will manufacturing and communications.

The world has been exceptionally cruel to our small nation.\n\nHowever, we endured. We fought tooth and nail to save our nation and our people, and not only did we succeed, but we managed to bring peace and stability to all of the Far East.

 MAG_import_machinery_desc: "The state of industry in Russia is rather poor. Not only is most of it decades old, leftover from the former Soviet Union and its industrial projects, but they're practically falling apart after so many years of use. Not only that, but our old and inefficient equipment is making our products more expensive and less competitive.\n\nIf we want to revitalize Russia's manufacturing sector and make our exports more attractive, we are going to need to bring our equipment up to the standards of the rest of the world.

 MAG_the_laborers_due_desc: "Factories in our country run day and night providing materials and goods for the greedy capitalists and corporatists of the nation. Day after day our citizens labor, crushed by the massive workloads they're given each and every day. Even then, after a long day's work and a short night's rest, they get the bare minimum a company is willing to shell out for their pay, sometimes not more than a few cents on the dollar an hour.\n\nIt's an angering thing, working so hard for so little, and the lower class seems to agree. If we're not careful, they may even fall under the influence of some charismatic populist or communist offering salvation in their ideologies. If we want to prevent that from happening and improve the stability of our nation, we should work towards improving the laborer's lot in life, starting with his pay."
 
 MAG_free_enterprise: "자유 기업"
 MAG_free_enterprise_desc: "During the warlord period of the Far East, Magadan's trade policy was made rather restrictive and limited. This wasn't so much for the protection of our industry so much as it was for national security. Agents and other malcontents were finding it rather easy to slip back and forth across the border with minimal interference when acting under the guise of businessmen and traders. When word got around about how simple it was to move people and goods across the border, the people were demanded action. The party agreed and put forth a series of restrictive trade laws and border regulations.\n\nHowever, times are different now, and if we want to loose the full power of capitalism and the free market on the economy, we are going to have to repeal those laws."

Fortunately, national security and defense is not so difficult.\n\nInstead of playing around with trade laws and border policies, we should instead be investing government time and effort into building up our military industry in order to protect ourselves from potential attacks from our neighbors in the west.

Production of goods have been steadily increasing across the last two quarters and we've witnessed record investment, both internally and externally, into the nation's economy as businesses have begun moving in.\n\nOur estimates for the manufacturing sector show signs that next year's growth rate may dwarf this year's growth by a factor of two.

 MAG_uplift_the_peasants_desc: "Among those who suffered the greatest from the collapse of the Soviet Union, it could be argued that the peasantry had it the worst. Not only were they roughly jerked around as hostile nations traded blows over their land, but they also witnessed helplessly as the bombings, fighting, and raids saw their farms destroyed. Under our government, this will be no more.\n\nThe peasantry of the nation will be subsidized for their troubles, in order to aid them in repairing their homes and livelihoods.

Originally built by the USSR during its mad run of construction projects before the collapse, the university was to have several schools, among which there a School of Mining, School of Law, School of Economics, School of Construction and Ecology, and several more. Given the large physical size and relatively well preserved buildings, it wouldn't be too difficult to set up a staff and integrate the new school into our tertiary educational system."

Not only is it important to be up to date in modern military technology, without which we would be crushed in a war with any of our more modern neighbors, but also in an economic sense.\n\nNew production techniques and technologies are being innovated all the time, and if we want our products to become more competitive on the global markets, we will need to innovate and adopt them.

In order to alleviate our manpower issues, we will fund the creation of the Russian Corps of Engineers.\n\nMuch like its American counterpart, the corps will provide construction services and assist in engineering projects across the nation.

The plan made significant progress in the short time it was being developed before Bukharin was removed from power, and continues to be the foundation of the Siberian economy even today.\n\nWe should seek to emulate such success. The plans were no secret in the Soviet Union, given the vast amount of resources and manpower it demanded. Factory managers and administrators all over the former union still have knowledge of this plan, and our administration has even found some documents and schematics that have been kept hidden away for all these years.

It is our sole infrastructural connection to the rest of Russia and must be maintained. Currently, much of the railway is in shambles after being bombed and fought over for several years.\n\nFortunately, no militaries in the Far East were so foolish as to allow harm to come to this vital link to inner Russia.

To that end, the Industrial Recovery Act will invest several millions of dollars into improving old factories and building new ones with the goal of incentivizing foreign corporations to set down roots in the Siberian National Republic.\n\nIf we can provide all the construction materials, raw materials, and transportation infrastructure to make starting a factory here cheap and easy, investors will come and invest."

 MAG_the_homestead_act_desc: "Much of our lands are sparsely populated despite modern technology allowing for significantly more agriculture and construction to be done in these regions. Our Homestead Act will seek to alleviate this by incentivizing our people to abandon the cities and make out there in the wild free lands of the north. Not only will we be offering free government land, but we will additionally further support farmers and homesteaders by offering government supply surpluses for their use at heightened discounts, mostly in the way of construction materials. Should all go well, we will see a further utilization of previously unproductive land sparking a population boom."

Mining companies in our lands extract hundreds of thousands of tons of gold, nickel, coal, iron, and chromium every year, and we expect that we could extract several times more than that with the right investment of capital and manpower.\n\nNot only would such additional resources production vastly benefit our economy, but our military industry would prosper as well. There are a variety of rare and valuable minerals that we find ourselves in constant need of when producing weapons or similar military equipment, and trading internationally for such resources can be a great national security risk, one we will hopefully avoid by increasing resource production domestically."

With great investment of capital, time and energy into the economy, we've managed to sow the seeds of a prosperous economy.

Our National Republic is well on its way to becoming an economic powerhouse, and soon, becoming Russia as well."

 MAG_the_national_republican_armed_forces_desc: "The armed wing of the former Russian Fascist party served their nation well in the past, marching from victory to victory all across the Far East. That being said, it has become increasingly clear that this force of armed thugs and vagabonds simply won't do if we are to continue the campaign to reclaim Russia. While we have no shortage of eager fighting men, the Siberian National Republic still has no official organized military to speak of.\n\nLet us remedy this before it is too late. The green light has been given for the formation of our young republic's official ground forces: the National Republican Army. The NRA is envisioned as a well-equipped and professional modern force, capable of facing any kind of potential battlefield scenario. Building such a force will take effort, but any price is worth paying for an army worthy to serve in Russia's name."
 
 MAG_tactical_refinement: "전술 정교화"
 MAG_tactical_refinement_desc: "The current unit tactics of the Siberian National Republic's armed forces are mostly unchanged from the days of the Russian Fascist Party. While they worked well enough and allowed for our total control over the Far Eastern regions, perhaps it would be wise to move on to a more intelligent tactic than just running and shouting at the enemy with guns blazing.\n\nPast battles have proved that, while this approach is quite heroic in theory, in practice it usually results in more casualties than necessary. The newly established high command of the NRA suggests a shift towards more conventional squad tactics to minimize casualties while simultaneously improving our units' performance on the field."
 
 MAG_new_training_methods: "새로운 교육 방법"
 MAG_new_training_methods_desc: "Currently, our soldiers would be charitably described as an undisciplined gang of thugs. Given the minimum level of training necessary and pushed out into the field without installing any real sense of professionalism, much of the army consists of rabid dogs prone to committing wholly preventable acts of collateral damage while, at the same time, being likely to turn tail at the first sign of danger.\n\nRigorous training regimens will be the key to turning this lawless rabble into a proper fighting force. The United States, a close partner of our regime, has one of the finest militaries on the planet at their disposal. Their troops' level of discipline is second-to-none, and we can only dream of building an army of the same kind of quality. The first step on that long road lies in overhauling the methods used to turn young men into soldiers, and we shall look to the American system for inspiration."
 
 MAG_stock_the_armories: "무기고 비축분"
 MAG_stock_the_armories_desc: "The only thing just as important as manpower is the guns they use. The plans for the establishment of the National Republican Army call for a massive increase of the total size of the armed forces, and right now our weapons production facilities are woefully inadequate to meet the potential demands.\n\nWe'll just have to make do with what we have. Our fledgeling armaments industry shall work round the clock to fill the armaments with high quality, modern weapons for our new recruits to use. If we can find ways to streamline the methods of weapons production, there will be no hesitation implementing them in the assembly lines. There must be a fully-loaded rifle in the hands of every soldier!"
 
 MAG_modernize_the_officer_corps: "장교단 현대화"
 MAG_modernize_the_officer_corps_desc: "The National Republican Army still does not have a proper officer force. How are the troops of the republic supposed to go into battle without skilled leaders to guide them? Our current pool of "officers" won't exactly be easy to work with- most of them are glorified gang bosses with cliques of loyal button men surrounding them like sycophantic flies.\n\nProfessional officers will be made of those who aren't too heavily consumed by the abyss of corruption, and promising new recruits will supplement those who are. Talented officers form the bedrock of a professional army, and encouraging strong leadership in the military would go great lengths in ensuring that the NRA becomes more than just a rag-tag band of brigands."

 MAG_praise_the_valiant_soratniki_desc: "Just when all hope seemed lost for Russia's future, and the former bastion of anti-Bolshevism was torn to shreds by conflict, the Vozhd and his noble soratniki miraculously turned the tables on the Far Eastern warlords and brought the entire region under one flag. The wars were brutal and inhumane beyond reason, but our brave boys pulled through and claimed victory even when the situation appeared hopeless.\n\nTruly this is one for the history books, a fine ray of hope in this dark chapter of Russian history! The struggle is not yet over, however, and our heroes will need all the help they can get when the time comes to bring all of Russia together again. The forces who oppose us are stronger than ever, and it will take all the strength we have to bring them to their knees.\n\nBrave men of the East, we hereby call upon you to join our cause! Join the National Republican Army, and together we shall march once more into legend!"

 MAG_the_buryatia_military_complex: "부랴티아 군사단지"
 MAG_the_buryatia_military_complex_desc: "The region of Buryatia is home to the most developed military production facilities in the Russian Far East. The armaments production centers in particular would be of great help to the cause, but upon further inspection it is obvious that they have seen much better days. Torn apart in the midst of the Bolshevik mutinies and further damaged during our invasion of the region, they will need some serious attention to bring them back online.\n\nOn top of the renovations, a comprehensive expansion of the facilities is planned. The capabilities of the Buryatia Military Complex will far surpass what it was able to achieve during the Bolshevik era. It will become the nucleus of the National Republic's military industry, tirelessly churning out vast quantities of war materiel for the army."
 
 MAG_study_foreign_designs: "해외 디자인 연구"
 MAG_study_foreign_designs_desc: "The state of the National Republican Army's equipment is, frankly, completely unacceptable. Bolt-action rifles and submachine guns might have been at the forefront of military ingenuity half a century ago, but they are simply too ancient by the standards of today. The fact is we need better guns, and lots of them. Ideally, standardized with all the modern bells and whistles would serve our purposes perfectly, but how to decide upon designs?\n\nThrough our ties with the United States, we could examine those of which are currently in use with the US military. From fully-automatic assault rifles firing intermediate cartridges to man-portable tank killers, the American arsenal is formidable indeed. We shall send experts from our R&D department on a field trip to the US with the aim of studying their weapons and finding ways to adapt them for our own forces."
 
 MAG_projekt_zmey: "프로젝트 즈메이"
 MAG_projekt_zmey_desc: "The National Republican army currently has no mechanized element to speak of. Even motorized equipment is a rare sight amongst the troops, and most have to make do with horses or specialized sleds. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, mechanized forces have become the standard. In the process of modernizing, mechanization is simply non negotiable. We need IFVs, and we need tanks.\n\nThe R&D department has begun an initiative fancifully called "Project Zmey": a research project tasked with developing modern fighting vehicles for the armed forces. Among the highest priorities are armored personnel carriers and main battle tanks, the bread and butter of any proper modern military. Our brave troops screaming across the battlefield in mobile carriers armed to the teeth with cannons and missiles is quite the spectacular image, and with a little effort it can become reality as well."
 
 MAG_reorganize_the_branches: "Reorganize the Branches"
 MAG_reorganize_the_branches_desc: "The organization of the National Republican Army is coming along well, and is rapidly becoming the modern force that was optimistically envisioned several months ago. That being said, the NRA cannot possibly hope to achieve everything at once. An air force to support our ground troops is badly needed, and it is imperative that we begin to assemble a separate military branch to serve in this regard.\n\nTo make matters worse, we have no actual fleet to guard the critical port of Magadan. The ships we do have could hardly be considered military vessels- being more intended for fishing than conducting war on the high seas. Before we can begin efforts to construct a fleet worthy of a newly revitalized Russia, a separate naval arm must be created."
 
 MAG_the_national_republican_navy: "국민공화국 해군"
 MAG_the_national_republican_navy_desc: "Despite our stronghold of Magadan being the most vital port in Russia still under the control of Russians, our republic still has no real navy to speak of. We have a few ships capable of undertaking military duties in the port of Magadan, but they are unorganized and not entirely ready to be sent out to sea. This changes today.\n\nThe National Republican Navy will be established to stand guard over Russia's waters, and the few existing ships of Magadan will be reorganized into proper fleets commanded by the few capable admirals we have at our disposal. To accomplish the further expansion of the new navy, the port of Magadan must be expanded far beyond its previous capabilities. Although it will never match the facilities of former Vladivostok, Magadan could perhaps become the next best thing."
 
 MAG_salvage_the_fleet: "Salvage the Fleet"
 MAG_salvage_the_fleet_desc: "When the Vozhd's forces captured the naval bases of Kamchatka, they had expected to find formidable Red Navy war vessels in near-pristine condition. What they found instead were retrofitted scrap heaps and rusty old tubs that could hardly be described as sea-worthy! Now we have a "fleet" of useless scrap heaps sitting in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky accomplishing nothing else besides being a major eyesore. Surely we could find a use for them?\n\nOur trade fleet needs ships, and some of these old vessels could serve that purpose handily. All they would need is some salvage work, and we could potentially get them sailing again. As for the glorified rust buckets that could not be useful to us in any possible scenario, we could always just sell them or break them down for scrap. One man's trash is another's treasure, after all."
 
 MAG_the_national_republican_air_force: "국민공화국 공군"
 MAG_the_national_republican_air_force_desc: "It is the foolish man who assumes that wars are only fought and won on the ground! Our new military is badly exposed without a strong air force to support them, and it is this fact that has led to the formation of the National Republican Air Force. Like their ground-based counterpart, the NRAF is envisioned as a fully modernized air force, equipped with some of the finest aircraft in the world.\n\nThese dreams are still a ways off due to our present scenario, but the foundation of a proper air component to the military is a good first step. The R&D department is already hard at work examining the latest foreign designs to adapt in some form for our new air fleet, and the results are promising indeed. Time to claim the skies for Russia!"
 
 MAG_expand_the_airfields: "공항 확장"
 MAG_expand_the_airfields_desc: "The National Republican Air Force grows by the day, but lacks proper air bases to conduct missions from. We could just build new air fields, but that would take far too much effort that would be better spent elsewhere. Besides, what use would building an ad-hoc landing strip in the middle of nowhere be when we have perfectly good facilities available for use right now?\n\nThere are several air bases previously controlled by the Tsarists and Bolsheviks that have gone unused since our conquest of the region. As such, these airfields are to be repaired and expanded to house an even greater capacity of aircraft than before. With time, they will become the nerve centers of the NRAF, the proverbial springboard from which all of their missions into the West will be launched."
 
 MAG_open_the_chita_military_academy: "치타 사관학교 개관"
 MAG_open_the_chita_military_academy_desc: "Say what you will about the Tsarists, but they had a fine cabal of officers at their disposal. Many of these sharp military minds now serve in our military, and have suggested the construction of a new military academy for the purpose of training the NRA's next line of officers. The existing high command has been quite receptive to this idea, and a suitable venue in Chita has already been decided upon to be renovated into what will become the Chita Military Academy.\n\nThis is where eager young recruits will be shaped into proper commissioned officers, worthy of commanding our troops and leading them to victory. With a healthy supply of new officers graduating from the academy, the soldiers of the National Republic can rest assured that only the finest military minds shall guide them into the fray. We can accept nothing less for the valiant army that is expected to make Russia whole again!"

 MAG_with_a_song_to_victory_desc: "Look upon this stalwart band of brothers! To think, not long ago, it was not much more than a disorganized rabble hardly fit to call themselves a gang of bandits, let alone an army. The establishment of the National Republican Army has exceeded our wildest expectations, and a fully modernized, professional military now awaits our command. No doubt, our neighbors to the west will grow rather nervous once they catch sight of our newly reorganized forces!\n\nPerhaps it is time to put our theories into practice. The National Republican Army stands ready, the National Republican Navy has their eyes to the sea, and the National Republican Air Force is prepared to unleash hell from above. At last, we can finally claim to be ready to continue the reunification of Russia. The moment to strike West rapidly approaches, and our commanders are confident that victory is all but assured.\n\nPrepare yourselves, brave soratniki of the Republic's armed forces, for your greatest challenge awaits!"

Unfortunately, the actions of our former rivals to the south means that the most natural and closest ally of convenience, Japan, won't even bother with assisting us.\n\nThis means that we have to look further east, across the Pacific: the United States of America.

By doing this, we will not only better assuage the fears of reluctant American leaders and better gear them towards assisting us, but also attract more emigres to come to our capital and begin working with us towards national reunification."

The signing of this act is a huge step towards official recognition by the United States and will prove to be a massive boon to our economy. We can expect to see the effects of this treaty almost immediately, with decreased tariffs and official American shipping lanes now stopping at the port of Magadan, we are sure that our exports and their associated profits to skyrocket as the American markets begin to get their first taste of the invaluable raw materials extracted from our Siberian tundra."

A brief radio announcement has been planned by [MAG.GetLeader] once they have returned and settled back into our capital. In the meantime, the Vozhd has announced a plan of strong, national development in lieu of the trading deal he had hoped to secure by travelling to Washington: the upgrading of infrastructure, the creation of new jobs and extending the previous developmental programs that we have already put in place."

 MAG_sponsor_the_russian_liberation_front_desc: "When the Japanese chose to support the mad Bandit King and the decrepit Tsarists instead of us, it shut a lot of doors in our proverbial face. This, however, is far from a bad thing. It woke our leadership up to the reality that the Japanese have no interest in a strong, Russian state: only a vested economic interest in exploiting Siberia for everything that it's got.\n\nOn top of this, the Japanese occupy rightful Russian land that they call "Outer Manchuria". Luckily, they barely keep even tentative control over the area, and have allowed the Russian Liberation Front to continue to operate through what only could be ineptness on their part. We should support these partisans with funding and material aid and ensure that they will continue to operate, harassing the Japanese and fighting for the return of our stolen territories from the south bank of the Amur to Vladivostok to our rightful control."

To our south, the Russian Liberation Front has long struggled against the Japanese and their Manchurian puppets, having worked towards the freeing of our stolen territories for years.\n\nWith the demotivated, slipshod Manchurian army comes the serious potential - and reality - of continuous, low-level insurgencies against the Japanese puppet government of Manchukuo and their benefactors from Tokyo. While these insurgencies have been long-suffering, it's time to help them turn things around.

From our humble beginnings in the freezing port of Magadan to the present, it seems as if it was forever ago that we were barely clinging on to our lives.\n\nHowever, much work still has to be done. While we're still planning on pushing westwards to reunify the entirety of Russia, there is also much to deal with domestically. The former Vozhd, tyrant and dictator, Mikhail Matkovsky once promised sweeping reform to placate the people and to create the illusion of cooperation to attract the investment of the Americans. However, his words were ingenuine and his promises false. Now that he has been removed from power, we can focus on real and meaningful reform."

 MAG_depoliticize_the_armed_forces_desc: "Despite all best efforts, we've witnessed the rise of corruption and cronyism within our armed forces, even from the earliest days following the trumping of the bandit king Rodzaevsky and the Tsarists of Chita. Plenty of officers maintain political ties, especially worrying are the ones who find themselves close with the Laborist wing of our party - those who would support the tyrant Matkovsky.\n\nThis cannot and will not stand. Our administration has worked too hard to marginalize Matkovsky's supporters and too much has been risked to allow a simmering of military support to boil over into a coup. We must investigate those who have ties with the Laborists - or any political wing. We should remove the worst, marginalize the others, and by doing so ensure that the military works for the government, and not the other way around."

After all, all individuals, and by extension, all governments, have a shared set of issues that need to be dealt with.\n\nThus, we should begin implementing a system, based on an American model, of cooperative federalism. That is, all federal, state, and local governments should work together, cooperatively and collectively, in order to solve problems shared among them. This policy is aimed at preventing the respective levels of government from dealing with problems separately - instead promoting an atmosphere of collaboration and trust between the highest government officials and the people that they represent."

Matkovsky was tactful, smart, and politically skilled. He spent his time working hard to create and preserve a nucleus of support - one that still, regrettably, exists despite his removal from power.\n\nThe shadow of the Vozhd still hangs over our administration, and his supporters, hiding in said shadow, prevent us from achieving what needs to be done. They need to be rooted out, exposed for who they are.

These corporations contributed generously to his own personal funds, which he used to buy off opponents, intimidate those who wouldn't be bought, and ensure that his grip on power would never loosen. In return, these corporations would be granted preferential treatment in a quid pro quo scenario.\n\nThese corporations have, of course, become accustomed to this sort of a deal, and now that we're in power, are in what is essentially open revolt due to our refusal to honor the prior deal. Despite their lingering influence in our administration, we need to work to eliminate their legacy in politics so that we can ensure that the government serves neither the military nor the private sector, but instead the Russian public."

Because of the origin of the party there, many in the international scene, let alone in Russia, know it as the center of what was once the organization that systematically terrorized those that it believed to be its ideological opponents.\n\nBut Harbin is so much more than that. A center of Russian émigré culture, a home to many, including our dear leader. A place where cultural roads crossed with one another.

It was more than a farce - a poorly written, hyperbolic work of fiction authored by an uneducated youth would provide a better framework for justice than the kangaroo courts the former Vozhd held. Justice was not objective - it was served and dispensed virtually directly from Matkovsky himself via parrot judges and puppet juries, who manipulated outcomes and rid the Vozhd of his opponents.\n\nThis has long been one of the darkest stains on the legacy of our party and has until this point held up our development of the future. We must ensure that a comprehensive reform of our justice system takes place to root out those that have done Matkovsky's bidding - the corrupt, the ideological, and the cowardly; these are the people who have no business judging whether the Russian citizen is guilty or not."

Claiming that the people weren't ready for a document as progressive as a constitution, it was an obvious cover for Matkovsky's true intentions: tyranny and oppression, the submission of the people to his will and his will alone.\n\nThis was not acceptable when the former Vozhd was doing it then, and now that he is gone, it is certainly not acceptable now. It's time for a constitution. In fact, it's well past the time for a constitution. But now we have a chance to right Matkovsky's wrongs. We must draft one now that will form the foundation of our republic in the years to come."
 
 MAG_towards_freedom_and_unity: "자유와 단결을 향해 전진!"
 MAG_towards_freedom_and_unity_desc: "We've done lots to further the cause of democracy and freedom within the territory that we control. We've reformed the dark stains left by the legacy of the so-called "Vozhd", Matkovsky, ensuring that there is fair justice, a fair economy, and a fair constitution that will ensure the rights of the people and of democracy in the decades to come. We have worked to depoliticize the army, destroy the legacy of Matkovsky, and clean the heritage of our origins.\n\nMuch work still needs to be done. But we can, if just for a moment, take a rest, and admire what we've accomplished. We are on the road to establishing a free and democratic country - Russia will be liberated."

 MAG_the_vozhd_marches_on: "보즈드는 행진한다"
 MAG_the_vozhd_marches_on_desc: "Siberia has finally been unified under the banner of Vozhd Mikhail Matkovsky. No more skulking in frozen wastes as lapdogs for the Japanese, no more petty squabbling amongst exiles for who bears the title of Kolchak's heir.\n\nWhile we had to remove some undesirable elements along the way it is all for the best of causes, the unity of the Motherland. The Russian National Labor Party stands united in their loyalty to the Vozhd."

 MAG_altering_the_siberian_bill: "시베리아 어음 개정"
 MAG_altering_the_siberian_bill_desc: "Nikolay Petlin was a troublemaker of a sort that could not be tolerated in this cruel world, a reformist full of ideas but with no common sense. Naturally he had to be eliminated, but that is not to say he must be wiped from memory. Many of his plans had the seed of a good idea within them, one that must be cultivated by a more experienced statesman to bear fruit.\n\nThe Siberian Bill was one of Petlin's better ideas, a new foundation for a great and powerful Russia to be built on. A few alterations to the bill and it will become a powerful statement, both to our own citizens and to observers from across the Pacific."

 MAG_immediate_universal_suffrage: "즉각적 보편 참정권"
 MAG_immediate_universal_suffrage_desc: "Russia must catch up with the nations of the West if it is to hope for their aid. The right to vote is something not seen here since the Novgorod Republic, and then only to the nobles.\n\nThe people will be truly grateful when we grant universal suffrage not only to men but to women as well, and it will most certainly put our name in the papers over in America as a true ally of democracy."

 MAG_state_department_of_moral_decency: "미 국무부의 도덕성"
 MAG_state_department_of_moral_decency_desc: "Ideas are a dangerous thing, and they must be controlled if Russia is not to fall into darkness once again. The Bolsheviks tore up Russian morals at the roots, permitting decadence, destroying the traditional family structure and even encouraging deviance.\n\nThe State Department of Moral Decency will ensure that all publications uphold the standards of the Russian people, not to mention including only appropriate political views. It would be an awful shame for anyone to be led astray."

 MAG_a_peace_preservation_law: "평화 보존법"
 MAG_a_peace_preservation_law_desc: "Whilst our state moves forwards in leaps and bounds, we must not let ourselves become dizzy with success. The right vote in the wrong place could be disastrous to our newly formed state, so we must ensure that the votes go to the right men.\n\nThe Peace Preservation Law will give us the state the right to veto candidates from the electoral register for the purposes of national safety. The Russian National Labor Party firmly believes in the system of one man, one vote. You get one vote, and one man to vote for."

 MAG_qualify_votes_and_districts: "투표 및 구역 자격 부여"
 MAG_qualify_votes_and_districts_desc: "The Far East is a vast place, so the issue of voting districts is a serious one. These districts are a powerful tool to assert control over this sparsely populated land.\n\nNon-Russian elements like the Sakha, Buryats and Mongols have been a thorn in our side for a while and will no doubt take the chance to cause a fuss when elections reach them. To this end, we must adjust the districts to ensure they remain a minority in these areas."

 MAG_the_ideological_quagmire: "이념의 수렁"
 MAG_the_ideological_quagmire_desc: "Central Siberia is a mess. Communist warlords, anarchist armies and mad kings have ruled the region for decades, resulting in a political situation that can generously be described as insane.\n\nIn order to return the region to normalcy we will send out agents of the State Intelligence Agency to better determine how the ideological situation of the area has stabilised. Once we know what the people truly believe we can correct it, or at least isolate them that their ideas do not truly take hold."

 MAG_the_consciousness_of_law: "법의식"
 MAG_the_consciousness_of_law_desc: "Sometimes, parents must keep things from their children. Does the parent then allow the child to run rampant, throwing a tantrum and causing trouble? Of course not. It is for this same reason that we must keep things from our people, and we must not allow them to kick up a fuss about it. The right to speak your mind is not a right, but a precious gift, one that we must only be used with our blessing.\n\nKeeping protestors off the street is for their own good, and preventing them from saying hurtful things is just good parenting."

 MAG_integration_of_the_sibplan: "시베리아 계획의 통합"
 MAG_integration_of_the_sibplan_desc: "While Bukharin's Soviet Union was a disaster for both Russia and the world, there is a silver lining to every cloud. His neglect towards Russia as a whole is balanced by his Siberian Plan, a comprehensive redevelopment of Siberian industry and an upgrade to the Trans-Siberian railway, connecting the vast underdeveloped land like never before.\n\nWhilst we have completed our own infrastructure projects we have only recently pushed far West enough to truly integrate ourselves with this network."

 MAG_politically_conscious_politically_convenient: "정치적으로 의식하고, 정치적으로 편리하다"
 MAG_politically_conscious_politically_convenient_desc: "Our efforts to perfect democracy have evidently paid off. The voting turnout has been impressively high in almost every district, with areas of low voting corresponding closely to areas with large non-Russian populations. The Russian National Labor Party has obtained an overwhelming majority in every district, due largely to there being no other available candidates.\n\nVozhd Mikhail Matkovsky has praised the Russian people for their newfound appreciation of democracy, and graciously accepted the mandate they have given him to continue his tenure as leader."

 MAG_no_partisanship_no_problem: "파트너쉽이 없다면 문제도 없다"
 MAG_no_partisanship_no_problem_desc: "The Siberian National Republic has become a peaceful place with the institution of rational democracy. With no opposition to disturb the peace, there is no means for troublemakers to spread their destructive tendencies.\n\nThe sole means to electoral success is through the Russian National Labor Party, ensuring that anyone desiring votes must have their political views moderated by its cooling influence or find themselves struck from the ballot."

 MAG_keeping_up_appearances: "체면 유지"
 MAG_keeping_up_appearances_desc: "Maintaining cordial relations with the Organisation of Free Nations has been one of the central parts of our strategy. Whilst once we were but one of many warlords begging for their attention, now we hold dominance over one of the largest countries on the planet, and we cannot be ignored.\n\nThat we may one day be recognised as the sole legitimate Russian government, we must dedicate funds to establishing embassies in the nations of the OFN. The Americans will find it impossible not to give us their vote of confidence considering the other powers in Russia."

 MAG_a_reliable_partner: "신뢰 할 수 있는 파트너"
 MAG_a_reliable_partner_desc: "Sure, the Siberian National Republic has its quirks, but it is in a deeply unique position. Certainly, there is less freedom of speech here than in America, but what country can't say that? Indeed, ethnic minorities may have a less than desirable position, but that is true of the USA as well. And yes, the Vozhd may be closer to a dictator than to a president, but he is a benevolent dictator, a true Cincinnatus.\n\nWe may be flawed, but above all we are reliable. We desire nothing more than to be a true good neighbour, and will go to any lengths to prove that to our American brothers."

 MAG_with_us_or_against_us: "우리와 함께하던가 아니면 우리와 대적하던가"
 MAG_with_us_or_against_us_desc: "While we want nothing more to be a good neighbour and to establish a good working relationship with our allies, we will not be pushed around. We aren't some petty warlord state anymore, but a true nation, with vast resources, a mighty army, and national pride. While we may work with foreigners we certainly do not rely on them, and we are more than willing to walk away from the negotiating table if we are being fleeced - so they'd better learn to work with us."

 MAG_sensible_concessions: "분별있는 양보"
 MAG_sensible_concessions_desc: "The OFN always have their demands for some minor thing or another, and whilst it may be against our immediate interests at home it behooves us to succumb to their pushes every once in a while. There is no sense letting them dictate the pace of our reforms entirely however - this is why we have a list.\n\nIndeed a portion of our time is spent searching for reforms we don't particularly care about that we can throw at the OFN as a paper shield. If we make enough small changes they won't bother to demand any big ones, and we can appear to be the progressive New Russia.\n\nAll for a good cause."

 MAG_protecting_corporate_interests: "기업의 이익 보호"
 MAG_protecting_corporate_interests_desc: "Business is the lifeblood of the state, and we must do all we can to ensure business goes smoothly. The vast lands of Siberia and the Far East are painfully underexploited due to their vast size and small population, so we must do all we can to smooth the path towards profit. The easier it is to do business here the more businessmen we will attract, and the more businesses that become embedded here the further we ingratiate ourselves with the OFN.\n\nTo attract business we must ensure that the rights of the people do not come before their own interests."

 MAG_an_army_to_be_proud_of: "자랑스런 군대"
 MAG_an_army_to_be_proud_of_desc: "Our army has come far. Once we were little more than gangsters enforcing our will onto the streets of Harbin, then paramilitary thugs doing the same in Magadan. We have had to adapt to survive, first innovating in the small unit tactics that allowed us to take towns and villages, then being forced to develop our own division level strategies when conflict arose with Rodzaevsky's dogs.\n\nUnity in the East was only the beginning though, for when we marched West we had to adapt to full-scale war on a massive front. In but a single decade we have developed an army almost on par with that of the West.\n\nAll it takes is a bit of polishing before we are ready for the final reclamation."

 MAG_the_struggle_for_the_national_russia: "국민 러시아를 위한 투쟁"
 MAG_the_struggle_for_the_national_russia_desc: "The way has been long and hard, but after all this time the Vozhd has solidified his grip on the National Republic. From a dream in the slums of Harbin to a reality of one of the largest nations on Earth, we are only a step away from the total reunification of Russia, from undoing the last twenty years of humiliation.\n\nAll that remains is to prepare ourselves for the final struggle."

 MAG.1.t: "마지막 진실된 이"
 MAG.1.desc: "마트코프스키는 안경을 낀 채 이름이 줄지어 늘여선 서류 한 장을 내려다 보았습니다. 로자예프스키 충성파로 의심되는 자들의 명단이였습니다. 마트코프스키는 고개를 들었습니다. 방은 백군 시절 책들과 삭아가는 옛 미국 신문들로 가득 차있었습니다. 그늘진 구석에는 낡은 축음기가 먼지 쌓인채 녹슬어가고 있었습니다. 그 광경은 마트코프스키의 얼굴에 능글맞은 미소가 떠오르게 했습니다. 옛 하얼빈 건물. 춤과 파티. 그리고 다른 무엇보다도 전기의 힘으로 빛나는 스와스티카가 기억에 남아있었습니다. 그건 하얼빈에 얽매인 러시아인들에게 새로운 미래를 약속했었습니다.\n\n초인종이 울려 마트코프스키를 몽상에서 끌어냈습니다. 당 제복을 입은 거친 남자 두 명이 들어왔습니다. 마트코프스키의 작고 지저분한 방 안에 선 남자들은 이상하게 보였습니다. 한 명이 몸을 기울였습니다. 모자 밑으로 살짝 보이는 금발 머리가 휘날렸습니다. 심지어 야만적으로 보이기까지 했습니다. 둘은 서투르게 경례하며 나무 바닥에 발을 크게 굴렀습니다. 다른 한 명은 다부진 몸을 갖고 있었는데, 배가 튀어나왔다는건 누구라도 알 수 있었습니다.\n\n잠시 동안 어색한 침묵이 흘렀다. 마침내 마트코프스키가 둘을 보며 말했다. "뭔가?" 둘은 떨리는 목소리로 오늘 숙청된 이들의 이름을 알려줬습니다. 마트코프스키는 너그럽운 미소를 지어보였다. "고맙네. 가도 좋아." 문 걸쇠가 닫히는 소리가 나자 그는 다시 명단을 보았습니다. 세르게이 A., 브루노 B., 니콜라스 C. 라고 적혀 있네요. 마트코프스키는 이름들 위에 두꺼운 검은색 잉크로 선을 그었습니다. 이들은 러시아 파시스트당의 역사에서 영원히 사라졌습니다. 마트코프스키는 손에 든 위스키 잔의 균형을 잡고는 한 모금 마시기 전에 흐릿한 액체에 비친 자신의 모습을 보았습니다.\n\n몇 시간 뒤 초인종이 울렸습니다. 남자들이 들어와 경례하고는 목록에서 사라질 이름들을 말해줬습니다. 가끔씩, 바람이 특정 방향으로 불 때마다, 깊은 숲 어디선가 나는 소총 소리를 들을 수 있었습니다. 명단을 다 읽었을 때는 밤이었습니다. 마트코프스키는 부하들이 일을 잘 해준데 감사를 표하며 나가라고 부드럽게 말했습니다. 남자들이 떠나자 마트코프스키는 문을 잠갔습니다. 축음기를 보며 하얼빈의 기억에 맞춰 춤을 추기로 했습니다. 그는 축음기를 키고는 좋았던 시절이 흘러가도록 했습니다."

 MAG.2.desc: "방송은 시작부터 잘못되었습니다. 자유 마가단 방송 토크쇼가 시작하기 전에 탁탁 소리로 가득 찬 노래 녹음들이 차례대로 연주되었습니다. 자유 마가단 방송 제작진들은 경험이 부족했습니다. 이들은 폭력을 휘두르는 것 외에 다른 일에는 익숙하지 못한 파시스트들이었습니다. 제작진은 베이스를 너무 많이 넣은데다가 트레블 다이얼도 이상하게 놓았습니다.\n\n녹음이 끊겼습니다. 쿵쿵거리는 소리가 들려옵니다. "켜진거야?" 거친 목소리가 말했습니다. 마이크에 너무 가까운 거리에서 입을 움직이고 있었습니다. "아 켜졌어!"\n\n다른 목소리가 들렸습니다. 부드러운 바리톤이 방 저 구석에서 말했습니다. "지금 방송 중이야. 대체 뭔 소리를 하는거야?" 테이블이 떨렸습니다. 목소리가 가까워졌습니다. 탁자를 두들기는 소리 세 번. "대본 읽어." 이상한 침묵. "마이크 연결 끊은거 까먹었어? 까먹었냐고?" 한숨. "완전 망했네 씨발." 마이크 선이 뽑히며 파직거리는 전기 소리가 났습니다. 엉망으로 조율된 노래가 다시 시작하며 덜걱덜걱 자유 마가단 방송의 첫 방송을 알렸습니다.\n\n다시 노래가 끊겼습니다. 거친 목소리도 돌아왔습니다. 여전히 마이크에 너무 가까웠습니다. "안녕하십니까, 극동의 러시아인 동포 여러분. 자유 마가단 방송의 첫 방송에 오신걸 환영합니다." 입 움직이는 소리. "저는 오늘밤의 사회자인 세르게이입니다. 옆에는 제 친구 바실..." 세르게이의 목소리가 점점 희미해졌습니다. 얼마 뒤, 세르게이는 마이크에 대고 고막을 터트릴 정도로 크게 외쳤습니다. "바실리!"\n\n바실리는 소리를 내며 자리에 앉았습니다. "네, 여기 있는 제 친구 세르게이와 함께 앞으로도 시베리아의 추운 밤들을 함께하겠습니다." 가짜 환호성. "우선, 이 프로그램을 후원해주신 러시아 파시스트당의 보즈드, 마트코프스키께 감사의 말씀을 드리고 싶습니다." 어색한 침묵. 녹음실 시계가 똑딱거리는 소리만 들렸습니다. "이제, 음악을 들려드리겠습니다."\n\n다시 음악이 켜지기 직전에 부드러운 바리톤이 말했습니다. "씨발 너 무슨 문제 있-""

 MAG.3.t: "권리 주장인"
 MAG.3.desc: ""To the Honorable Claimant to the Throne of Russia," the letter read so far, "we have come to beseech you for your aid against our mutual enemy, the traitor Konstantin Rodzaevsky." No, the letter ought not to be so direct. Putting down his pen, Matkovsky laid his hand across his face and sighed. Leaning his forearm against the table and propping his head against his open palm, he stared at the page, waiting to be filled with his writing. His tea sat right below him, its smell tempting him. Matkovsky tapped his feet. He has no time for that now.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, Matkovsky found himself adjusting his glasses, his fingers rapping the table in sequence. A thousand questions swarmed his mind. What if the Tsarists reject the treaty? What if they find the terms unacceptable? He shuddered to think of what would happen if both sides did not cooperate against Rodzaevsky. Someone knocked on the door. Rather than answering, Matkovsky's index finger mimicked the rhythm on his table.\n\nStanding from his seat, he said aloud, "The letter is not ready yet. Go away." The knockings stopped. He looked at the letter. Clapping his hands together and drawing a deep breath, he sat down, toying with the pen as he thought of what to say to Mikhail.\n\n"We appeal in the name of our old friendship," he scribbled without much thought, "in the Anti-Bolshevik Front. As we all know..." He found his hands picking up speed. Before long, he would stand and say:"

 MAG.5.desc: "니콜라이 페틀린은 넥타이를 고쳐맸습니다. 오래 전 러시아 파시스트당에서 배운 정신적인 행동이었습니다. 그는 책상 위를 보며 마트코프스키가 맡긴 임무를 곰곰히 생각했습니다. 수많은 잉크리본 사이에 둘러싸인 타자기는 사치품이나 다름 없었습니다. 페틀린은 이 편지와 호소문을 손으로 쓰는 광경을 떠올릴 수 없었습니다. 그는 오랜 시간을 집무실에 있었습니다. 다시 타자를 칠 준비를 하자 손가락이 경련을 일으켰습니다. 조수들이 모든걸 하지는 못했습니다. 조수 중 영어를 할 수 있는 이는 없었습니다. 마트코프스키에게 도와달라고 하는것은 예의 없는 짓이었습니다.\n\n페틀린은 한숨을 쉬었습니다. 그는 마트코프스키가 한 말을 기억했습니다. "백악관에 사는 남자를 설득시키도록." 상관은 페틀린의 눈을 똑바로 쳐다보며 그렇게 말했습니다. "그게 다일세." 마트코프스키는 가볍게 여겨지는걸 좋아하지 않았습니다. 상황이 좋을 때, 페틀린은 마트코프스키의 안에서 오래된 하얼빈의 영혼을 보곤 했습니다. 희망의 영혼. 선동의 영혼. 새로운 고향을 위한 기도의 영혼. 겨울은 그 남자에게서 통행료를 받아냈습니다. 수척하고 붉게 물든 뺨은 그 통행료의 증상일 뿐이었습니다.\n\n페틀린은 책상 밑을 보았습니다. 종이 뭉치 위에 종이 뭉치가 쌓여있었습니다. 거의 수천 장은 될 정도였습니다. 곧 그의 임무가 끝나면 이 종이들은 미국으로 보내져 우편함에 들어갈 것입니다. 상원의원, 하원의원, 러시아 망명자들, 마트코프스키의 계획에 있는 여러가지 사람들의 우편함에 말이죠. 제일 먼 곳에 있는 종이 뭉치 위에는 노란빛 마닐라지로 묶인 서류철 하나가 있었습니다. 그 앞에 붙은 라벨에는 이렇게 써져있었습니다. "시베리아 권리장전", 그 서류에는 더 많은 지원을 끌어올, 최소한 미국인의 지지를 받을 페틀린의 개인적인 아이디어가 들어있었습니다. 자기가 진짜 지지하는게 뭔지 마트코프스키가 알고 있을까 생각이 들었습니다.\n\n페틀린은 고개를 저었습니다. 지금은 마음 가는 대로 생각할 때가 아니었습니다. 페틀린은 타자기에 손을 올렸습니다. 탁타탁 소리가 나기 시작했습니다."

 MAG.6.t: "파시즘 백작"
 MAG.6.desc: ""즈다로바(잘 지냈나), 마트코프스키 형제여!" 한 남자가 부두 위에 서서 불렀습니다. 기울어진 몸과 창백한 얼굴을 한 남자는 이른 아침 공기 속으로 손을 뻗어 마트코프스키에게 인사했습니다. 아나스타시 본시아츠키, 파시즘 백작으로도 알려진 이가 마가단 항구에 발을 디뎠습니다. 본시아츠키는 앞으로 나아갔습니다. 걸음걸이는 열정이 차있었으며 빨랐습니다. 구세계에서 소위 동등한 위치의 사람을 만나는 것을 기다리지 못하는 모습이었습니다. 항구에서 나는 냄새를 맡은 본시아츠키는 코를 막았습니다. 아침의 햇빛 속으로 떠나려 하는 나무 어선 앞에 선 모습은 작고 한심하게 보였습니다.\n\n마트코프스키는 미간을 찡그렸습니다. 지금 이 세상에서 자신에게 그렇게 말을 걸 권리가 있는 사람은 없었습니다. 마트코프스키와 경호원들은 짜증과 어색함이 섞인 미소를 지으며 백작을 만나기 위해 걸어갔습니다. 마트코프스키는 환대의 뜻으로 손을 뻗으며 말했습니다. "즈드라스트부이체(안녕하신가). 미국은 어땠나?"\n\n본시아츠키는 숨을 내쉬기도 전에 마트코프스키의 손을 움켜쥐었습니다. "훌륭했네, 형제여." 본시아츠키는 마트코프스키를 껴안기위해 앞으로 몸을 숙였습니다. 마트코프스키는 그냥 안기기로 했습니다. 미국이 본시아츠키를 바꿔놓은게 틀림 없었습니다. 친밀한 제스쳐, 과하게 감정이 실려있고 거리낌 없는 기분, 그리고 이러한 인사. 전부 동료 러시아인에서 받기에는 좀 지나친 것들이었습니다. 여전히 그런 기분에 취해있던 본시아츠키는 큰 소리로 말했습니다. "자유의 땅이야. 이것들은 전부-" 본시아츠키는 손짓했습니다. "우리에게 너무 작다네."\n\n"형제, 여기 있는 이유를 잊은 것 같군." 마트코프스키가 말했습니다. 목소리에는 쌀쌀맞은 암시가 숨어있었습니다.\n\n"아냐, 아냐." 본시아츠키는 주머니에 손을 찔러넣었습니다. "이 남자가 내 선물일세." 그는 베레모를 쓴 미국인의 흑백 사진을 보여줬습니다."

 MAG.7.desc: "보슬비가 만든 빛의 장막이 마가단 항구 위에 내려앉았습니다. 구름은 강철같은 회색을 온 몸에 둘렀고, 항구의 물은 내륙으로 밀려들었습니다. 그 앞을 막는 것은 낮게 세워진 방파제였습니다. 부두에는 나무 어선이 고정된 채로 늘어서 있었습니다. 맹렬한 바람과 얄팍한 비, 얌전히 있을 줄 모르는 파도가 선체를 뒤흔들었습니다. 눈에 띄는 배가 하나 있었습니다. 갑판은 금속으로 되어있고 선수가 녹에 뒤덮힌 배였습니다. 격동하는 공기조차 배를 떨게 하지 못하는 것 같았습니다.\n\n마트코프스키는 이 이상한 배를 향해 걸어갔습니다. 상관을 폭우로부터 지키기 위해 우산을 든 부관이 뒤따랐습니다. 본시아츠키의 말이 사실이라면 이 배의 주인이 누구인지는 물어볼 필요도 없었습니다. 미첼 워벨. 전설적인 용병. 전 세계에서 벌어진 수천번의 전쟁의 베테랑. 악명 높은 용병. 속삭이는 죽음의 마법사. 마트코프스키는 이 남자의 전설과 만나고자 마음을 단단히 먹었습니다. 누군가가 비틀거리며 배에서 나와 휘청거리며 다가오는게 보였습니다.\n\n마트코프스키는 눈을 깜빡였습니다. 틀림 없었습니다. 저 자가 워벨이었습니다. 마트코프스키가 본 사진에 비해 애송이 같았습니다. 머리통 위에는 베레모가 위태롭게 걸쳐져 있었습니다. 마트코프스키는 더 빨리 나아갔습니다. 부관이 따라가기 힘들어할 정도의 속도였습니다. 워벨과 마주보게 되었을 때, 그 남자는 서투른 미소를 지으려 했습니다. 경멸로 오해될 뿐이었지만 말이죠.\n\n"잘 오셨습니다." 마트코프스키는 영어로 말했습니다. "기대하고 있었습니다. 워벨씨."\n\n"프리벳(안녕하십니까)." 워벨이 말했습니다. "제 따바라시(동지여)." 워벨은 러시아어로 계속 말했습니다. 어떤 단어를 써야할지 모를 때는 영어 단어를 섞어썼습니다. 마트코프스키는 러시아어를 더럽히는 짓을 하지 못하게 설득하려 했습니다. 가끔 워벨의 방식으로 한 두 단어가 나오긴 했지만 마음이 진정되지는 않았습니다. 워벨이 정확히 말한 얼마 안되는 러시아어조차 넉넉한 양의 "씨발"과 "썅"에 범벅이 되어있었습니다. 마트코프스키는 맹렬한 분노와 어색함 속에서 얼굴을 붉히며 손을 뻗었습니다.\n\n마트코프스키는 계속 미소를 지으려고 노력하며 말했습니다. "아름다운 우정의 시작을 위하여." 워벨은 의심하지도, 이해하지도 않고 마트코프스키의 손을 꽉 잡았습니다."

"몇 시간 동안 여기 있었는데 아무 대답도 없어."\n\n이제 다른 방법을 찾아야 해. 드미트리는 생각했습니다. 그래서 무릎을 꿇고 문고리의 열쇠구멍을 바라보았습니다. 할 수 있을 겁니다. 주머니에서 락픽을 꺼내 조심조심 밀어넣었습니다. 안에 있는 기계를 건드리거나 손상시키지 않도록 말이죠. 어떻게든 문을 열어야 했습니다. 열쇠구멍을 막는 것은 모두를 힘들게 할 뿐이었습니다. 그러면 도끼가 필요할수도 있겠네요. 사실 이반은 몇 번이나 항의하려 했습니다. 그냥 예비 열쇠를 달라고 하면 되는 일이었습니다. 하지만 드미트리는 듣지 않았습니다.\n\n문에서 찰칵 소리가 났습니다. 드미트리는 폴짝 뛰고 싶은 충동을 막으며 일어났습니다. "봤지?" 드미트리는 이반에게 말했습니다. 이반은 영혼 없는 미소로 대답했습니다. 드미트리는 문고리를 돌렸습니다. 하지만 문은 꼼짝하지도 않았습니다. "안에서 빗장을 걸었나봐, 젠장!" 드미트리는 발끈하며 문을 걷어 찼습니다. 이반이 어깨를 두들기며 물러나라고 했습니다. 이반은 도끼로 문을 여러번 후려쳤습니다. 나무 조각이 사방으로 날아갔습니다. 마지막 순간, 이반이 포기하려 했을 때 문이 열렸습니다.\n\n"본시아츠키씨. 당신-" 이반은 말을 멈췄습니다. 본시아츠키가 가슴을 꽉 쥔 채로 바닥에 드러누워 있었습니다. 눈은 희멀갰고, 얼굴은 창백했습니다. 죽은 것입니다.\n\n어느 저녁, 마트코프스키 집무실의 전화가 울렸습니다."

"근처에 일을 제대로 하는 사람이 적어도 하나 있어서 다행이군." 마트코프스키가 보기드문 미소를 지었다.\n\n페틀린이 악수했다."예, 대표님. 시키신대로 하겠습니다. 제 출신과 지위에 과분한 찬사입니다."\n\n마트코프스키가 어깨를 토닥였다. "당연한 일이지." 페틀린은 돌아서서 그가 들어온 곳으로 나갔다."

Tonight was a special night, a time to talk with an old friend. So long as she also held to her schedule, that is. Ten seconds out. WerBell rubbed his hands against his temples. This Siberian business was hard, and Matkovsky was proving himself to be no pushover. WerBell smirked; the damned bastard would have his due.\n\nFingers on the dial, two seconds out. When it reached ten o'clock, his right hand snapped, finding the frequency that she used, locking on to it without difficulty. He reached for the microphone and spoke at it. "White Mouse," he said, waiting expectantly for a reply, "are you there?"\n\n"You're late," a kindly, maternal voice replied, "Maybe age has slowed you down a bit after all." She laughed. WerBell smiled. On the other side was the White Mouse, One of the Brits who had the backbone to fight in a war and be good at it, and a comrade during all those times where the Americans lost the torch of liberty before falling down a set of stairs to disgrace. "Good to see you, Wizard." He saw her firm, proud smile beyond the radio waves.\n\n"Likewise, Mouse," WerBell said, kicking back in his seat, the microphone standing precariously on his chest, "How is Kamchatka? Is it a shithole too?"\n\nHe felt her frowning at him. "Language, wizard," she said, sighing, "But yes, there is not much to do around here."\n\n"Still looking up to Uncle Sam?"\n\n"You know it," she said, "I know you've gone indie and all, but the OS-, no, the CIA has a proposition for you."\n\n"Forget it," He said, fuming. Make no mistake, he liked Nixon - only a good American could bring America back together, and not those cowardly liberals with their talk of "peace, land, and bread." Fucking communists. He just couldn't let go. "I still remember the last time I worked for those no-good bast-"\n\nThe White Mouse hushed him. "We also have taken your concerns to mind."

They had bought this from an admittedly sketchy merchant selling American goods in the port of Magadan. Still, the surface of the thing was shining with polish, a particularly American brand of burnishing that made cheap things look luxurious. They turned the dial to Magadan Free Radio, whose frequency they had scribbled onto a piece of paper earlier.\n\nThe mix was better this time. As usual, they played Russian patriotic songs, with the Siberian hunters singing and humming along to the melody, despite having no idea as to what the lyrics were. Instead of cutting entirely, the radio quieted as the talk show began.\n\n"Welcome to Magadan Free Radio!" A coarse voice, with some lip-smacking but not as much as before. "Your only source of news in the Far East! I'm here with my co-host, Vasily!"\n\n"Hello." A smooth baritone, with some genuine cheer in how he talked now.

In front of him were remnants of a campfire, and the results from the hunt last night: two foxes and a rabbit. Waking up to greet the new day, he lifted his sidearm and looked over it, balancing it in his hands as he did so. Apart from some dirt stains, it was clean. He pressed the magazine release, and then pulled the slide back. A cartridge flew into the air with a faint ping. All the bullets were there.\n\nSo far, Oleg did not have to use his gun on anything. No bear nor leopard even came close to him, although he did see them in the wild. The foxes, rabbits, and other assorted animals he hunted were the results of his traps. Using the gun on them would ruin their flavor and make them possibly unsafe to eat. To survive, Oleg learned, one must be ready to not only exercise force, but also restraint.\n\nHe picked up the stray bullet and shoved it back into its magazine. Time for his daily ritual. Setting himself down, Oleg began taking apart his gun. Setting the parts down on dried rabbit fur, he took out his canteen, and started cleaning the parts delicately. After each piece was free of grime and dust, he rubbed them on the fur, making sure they were dry. With icy fingers, he assembled the gun. To see if anything was wrong, he slid the magazine back and cocked the action. A snap. Oleg smiled. Today was a good day too.\n\nThe Siberian Rangers would come back for him, any day now."

He did not sleep at all last night, right after they delivered his verdict. He cracked his fingers through cuffed hands. They were taking him deep into the woods of Siberia, in the middle of nowhere, far from civilization. He felt his body twitch all over. The withdrawal was encroaching on his mind, and an uneasy cold settled over his bones.\n\nThe men tasked with escorting him spoke foreign, faraway languages that he did not know even the slightest. All they did was use the muzzles of their rifles to poke Rodzaevsky forward whenever it seemed that he was close to stopping. He knew that someone in the group spoke Russian; he didn't know which was which. The air grew hotter and hotter, swaddling his body with a thin curtain of sweat.\n\nHis mind wandered to strange places. He wondered about Matkovsky. They said they had never found a body. Rodzaevsky knew Matkovsky and his sly wit. Siberia was vast and empty. It would take a lot of sentries spread across a general direction to eventually find him. Devil, devil! Matkovsky was his worthy opponent: a fellow Russian who contended for power, not a mercenary out for money.\n\nThey reached a clearing in the middle of the woods. One of them, the Russian speaker, went behind Rodzaevsky and blindfolded his eyes. It seemed like even the mercenaries had a touch of humanity. As his sight failed, he heard footsteps trail behind him, and rifles pointed in his direction ready to fire a single shot that would end his life. A voice gave a signal and the enfilade started.

Their equipment was in a similarly poor state, with most "soldiers" equipped with creaking, almost non-functional rifles like old Arisaka models and Mosin-Nagants dating back to the days of the Great War. A good fit for an army of wax models in a museum, perhaps, but not enough for a host with the intent to fight, as the Vozhd (Russian leader) humbly put it, "a total crusade to save Russia."\n\nWe commenced training as soon as we pinned down the RFP's situation. That is where we encountered another problem: the nepotism ingrained within the "officer corps" of the RFP was so prevalent that men who could barely hold the weight of a rifle bore such high ranks as Lieutenant, Captain, or even Major. Pressed on the issue, the Vozhd agreed to fire these people immediately, much to his credit. He also approved the building of several officer schools to whip up the higher ranks of his army into shape.\n\nThe reports we have received from the frontlines indicate good results. The border clashes against their neighbors have indicated a good increase in performance, regardless of victory and defeat. We will continue to monitor the situation and issue reports whenever possible. Mason out."

In Magadan, they walked around town, their expensive gear strapped to their bodies, flirting with the girls and ladies they saw along the way. They seemed not to have a care for Russia; it was just another playground for them, a vacation, a holiday in a desolate land where they got to shoot the natives. Smith (no given last name), in particular, came from South Africa, his hands itching for the trigger of the gun, his ears for the thrill of gunfire, his head and brain for the conduct and raw barbarity of combat.\n\nWerBell wasn't lying when he said that his gear was going to be good. His M16, strapped to his back, was the meanest piece of lead spitter this side of Russia. The RFP militias did not have them, only given old US M1 Garands instead, for they were not Smith. The fields, savannahs, plains, and jungles of Africa made themselves known through his copper, sun-burnt skin. He had all the reason in the world to be cocky. When his folks back home ask him why he had gone into the business, "To find a lady," came the answer. All who truly understood Smith knew that he wasn't in it for love, but the thrill of war and money.\n\nHe could see the Russians eyeing his gear with envy in their eyes. He smirked at them and winked. Every time he smoked, they would marvel at his tidy, clean, well-rolled cigarettes. Once in a while, he even offered them one. Warfare was a trade, and business was good. Leaning back against a wall in a random part of the podunk town, he took one of his fabulous cigarettes out and lit one.\n\nFor a backwater and deserted place, Magadan was pretty good. Not on the level of Bloemfontein, but pleasant enough. However, his heart was never there. Out west, closer to lines of the tsarists and Rodzaevsky's loyalists, beneath the blazing gunfire and artillery bombardments, was where he belonged.

An alien object nestled itself in his left shoulder, refusing all attempts to move it. The pain kept on giving, a radiant sun that bled an unfading, persistent coppery smell. He had the faintest idea of what happened to him, its images surfacing along with the shocks of pain that sent him receding towards the depths of unconsciousness. He was expecting for Ivan to leave him for dead, and make for the lines in all haste - their reassignment was the fault of his pride after all - but he felt himself tumble and shake, but never falling.\n\nSay what you would about Ivan: quiet, brutish, stupid, but he was a good friend. Dmitry's blood-stained and pain-wracked mind squeezed skepticism of Ivan's efforts, but his heart begged him to hope. It implored with every beat, refusing to let itself die. It grew fainter and fainter, as the hours passed by, but it dragged its death out. Instinct, not intellect, became the lifeline upon which Dmitry hung himself. His grasp was tenuous, and at every turn of the forest trail, through every bush that Ivan's feet trudged through, he would not let go.\n\nAt long last, Ivan's feet gave. He collapsed, sending Dmitry tumbling through the ground, with dirt and rocks striking his face and body. He felt his wound open, as the bandages that held him together tore itself apart. Sound, noises, voices. Footsteps through the ground, noises of guns, voices of gruff men in foreign languages cloud his ephemeral mind. As he passed out from this world to the next, he heard gunfire and saw muzzle flashes out of the corner of his eye. In his final moments, he smiled; Ivan was not going quietly.

Soldiers and local talents alike mingled with the crowd, and alcohol flowed freely from the pubs to the offices of the commanders. WerBell drank his fill, and he gulped it deeply. He had won, and to the victor goes the spoils. Or the swills, in his case.\n\nIn the next room over, the rest of his officers convened, their voices like indistinct bangs and thuds against the wooden wall. Sometimes he could hear a word or two emerge from the discussion, but his whiskey-addled mind soaked every last bit with liquor, and every phrase slid drowsily into his brain. No matter. He could trust his officers; they were loyal to more than their paycheck. If it had been the regular bread-and-butter mercenaries, he would have howled at them and shot his revolver all over the room.\n\nHe looked at the tea-colored substance lying in wait in the shot glass on the table, inviting him to take it for a single sip. Maybe he can. Maybe not. Better not to take the risk. Tonight was a fateful night. His neighbors were making history.\n\nThe door creaked open. "Sir?"

Petlin, the man he considered to be almost a brother to himself, his own foreign minister! He stared into Petlin's eyes, finding fear and obedience settling their weight into his psyche. Maybe this was not intentional after all.\n\n"Sir, if I may explain myself," Petlin said, freezing his hand before it could correct his tie, "The Americans are different from us. We need to-"\n\n"I get your point, Petlin, it's just," Matkovsky said, waving off Petlin, "This is not what I - not we - stand for. When I read your document I found phrases like the 'right to assembly', 'right to free speech.' These are all dangerous ideas, not fit for Russia. Their rebellious intent practically jumps off the pages." Matkovsky sighed, "Just what the hell were you thinking, brother?"\n\nPetlin gathered himself and stood straighter. "Sir, if I may insist, my ideas can still be useful. Not only in convincing the Americans but the Russians as well." He cracked his knuckles in anxiety. "I have faith in the strength of our ideals and conviction, sir, I do. I beg you not to mistake my incompetence as rebelliousness."\n\nMatkovsky felt a rare moment of generosity, stretching his arms wide. "Petlin, Petlin," he said, tapping his foreign minister on the shoulders, "I would never. You have been with us since the beginning, closer to me than even my chancellor." He whispered to Petlin, "Now help me with all these, I am afraid that your brother lacks the skill necessary to convince the Americans."\n\n"Y-yes," Petlin said, his voice trembling, "I will do as you say."\n\n"Good. Now, cut back. We can't afford all of this. Make holes and loop them. Dismissed." Petlin left the room in a great hurry."

There was an irony to it all: despite having been schooled and educated in one of the most renowned countries on Earth, Mason was as out of his depth as the illiterate Russian fascists standing before him. The cold, chilly air of the early morning gave his percussive heartbeat a tinge of anxiety and excitement in his veins. The training fields were empty save for a few animals scurrying underfoot.\n\nAn officer prefaced him. "From the honorable nation of America," he goes, "Mason has come..." A bunch of feel-good bromides and legalese, but he guessed that the soldiers needed to respect him first before they would be willing to listen to him. He caught a few of them eyeing the equipment he brought here. Mason didn't think it was all that impressive, considering the things he had seen while working in the agency, but, again, cultural and technological differences.\n\nAfter a few hour-long and anxiety-ridden minutes, it was finally his turn to speak. He drew back his tongue and lashed it out, throwing the dust off the language he seldom used. "Hello," he said, "as the officer has said, my name is Mason." He grabbed an M1 Garand and held it against his shoulders. "This is the Garand. You." He pointed to a random soldier in the crowd. "Fire your weapon, see how fast you can do it." He pointed to a target in the distance. The soldier had to eject his casings every time he fired. Sometimes, he resorted to hitting his rifle with his wrist before it worked.\n\n"Now watch this," He aimed the Garand and fired eight shots in succession, his streak stopped by the ping of the gun. He laid the rifle beside him, its butt on the ground. "And that is American firepower!" He said to the awed fascists."

The chilly morning air seemed not to have any effect on the Vozhd, who was in full military dress, as he and his high command approached the troops in formation. All of the soldiers were dressed as he was and sported their weapons of war, but even before he approached them, Matkovsky could tell what poor soldiers they would make. His generals exchanged nervous glances with one another.\n\nOne soldier was too fat, the other malnourished. The third was too short and the fourth didn't have his uniform's buttons done up right. They all had the full uniform, but it seemed as if they had simply borrowed bits and pieces from their peers, as a lot of them didn't fit. All of them, not just these four, were equipped with weapons that looked like they had been outdated by the time the Germans were ravaging the west of Russia. This sorry state of affairs made it blatantly obvious to Matkovsky that on one of the most important days of their lives, these troops could barely muster together even the smallest shred of professionalism. The inspection ended, Matkovsky politely walking along the columns of the Magadan garrison, taking mental notes. Scruffy beards, outdated weapons, ill discipline. Matkovsky knew that it wasn't their fault, for the most part. He had a chronic shortage of bodies, weapons, and officers, all of which were necessary for raising and maintaining a professional army.\n\nAfter the inspection, he had called a meeting of his high command, where a rare flare of anger shone through his usual professional behavior. "What is going on? These are the best troops that you have to offer me?" he asked his generals. A number of cursory excuses were offered, but Matkovsky put his hand up to demand their silence. "I don't want to hear it. If those are the men who guard the capital, what do those on the front lines look like? How do you think we will overcome Rodzaevsky, let alone retake the entirety of Russia? I don't care what the solution is, I want you to find it. And I want to be briefed on it this time tomorrow.""

 MAG.26.desc: "In the months since Matkovsky's scathing inspection of the Magadan garrison, things seemed to go from bad to, well, surprisingly good. Matkovksy's generals and administration had taken upon themselves to figure out some way to improve the true RFP's fighting ability. "The answer was simple", mused one senior officer. "When we realized we couldn't use conscripts, we bought soldiers from abroad instead". Indeed, mercenaries and military advisors, state-sponsored or otherwise, have been slowly but surely streaming into the frozen port of Magadan to not only pad Matkovsky's army of ill-suited conscripts, but to train them as well, to crack the whip and bring them, kicking and screaming, into the world of professionalism. The fat ones were now skinny, the malnourished ones healthy. All of them had a semblance of fighting spirit for the first time ever, and the guns, while still archaic, were at least cleaned and maintained properly. Training, as barebones as it was, actually began to prepare the conscripts and their mercenary counterparts for the realities of modern warfare in the frigid forests and marshes of Siberia. All this of course was tacked on to a very long and expensive bill that Matkovsky had to pass off to his administration. He was confident that there would be something for them to pay the mercenaries with.\n\nAfter Matkovsky's second inspection of the troops, which like the first, was kept as a surprise, he once again called a meeting with his general staff. As they filed in, worried that the new inspection was not enough of an improvement from the original, many nervously fiddled with pens, or reports, while others looked anywhere but where Matkovsky stood. As they all assembled, the Vozhd spoke. "After this second inspection", he said, in his normal, reserved manner, "I want to say good job, to all of you". Many were surprised. "I know that the task I assigned to you was not an easy one, and while we're far from perfect, I am pleased with the progress that we're making. The path to seek out mercenaries and foreign support was not one that I would have expected, but it's clearly working, and I will be meeting with some top advisors about how to increase the numbers and effectiveness of these foreigners".

Today's movie was an adaptation of a famous American comic book, Captain America. For Thomas, a connoisseur supreme of the movie industry, this film was trash.

It only took a minute before one of the mercenaries accidentally fired a shot, resulting in a dead civilian who was only found hours later after the rioting that ensued.\n\nThe locals, instead of being driven back by gunshots, charged the armed men, using broken bottles and chairs to attack the new arrivals.

In the event of this war, Matkovsky's faction wishes for a ceasefire between our forces so that he may better focus on the enemy at hand.\n\nWhile we can hardly trust these despicable fascists, we cannot deny that Rodzaevsky is far and away the larger threat at the moment.

 MAG.40.desc: "Even by the standards of the Far East, this was a shitty bar. The floors creaked at the slightest movement, and the beer tasted like bear piss. There wasn't even plumbing, and yet this was WerBell's choice for a meeting place. Alexander Pavlov was decidedly unimpressed. Matkovsky, his old boss, had taken great care to manage his image, all for the benefit of the Americans. Now the Americans were here, and they behaved like pigs. Even now the mercenaries were busy stinking up the bar with their ugly accents and drunken hooliganism. The only thing keeping him here was the fact that Pavlov's transition from the orderly world of fascism to the chaotic, pecuniary land of the new Far East had not exactly been smooth; he needed word, and badly. He resolved, perhaps unwisely, to hear WerBell out.\n\nWhen the mercenary captain sat down at the table at last, thirty minutes behind schedule, Pavlov straightened his posture self-consciously and gave his greeting. "Mr. WerBell, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. As you're no doubt aware, I served under the previous administration as the Vozhd's top man in matters of internal security, and you'll find in short order that I am quite professional, should you choose to entrust me with such matters."\n\nWerBell met his offer with complete silence. Pavlov thought at first that this was contemplation, before realizing that the mercenary's eyes were completely uncomprehending. Oh, dear lord. The man barely understood Russian. WerBell pulled one of the other mercenaries over to the table and beckoned to Pavlov to continue. The rest of the negotiations progressed with the other man clumsily interpreting in his slightly less bad Russian, and they proved surprisingly fruitful. Clearly, the Americans had a deficit of loyal locals, and Pavlov was more than happy to fill it."

 magexp.1.t: "꼭두각시 차르"
 magexp.1.desc: ""식사는 입에 맞으십니까" 마트코프스키가 쇠고기 조각을 썰면서 말했다. "로마노프씨?" 맞은편에는 차르주장자 미하일이 앉아있다. 며칠전 러시아 파시스트당이 미하일의 "황궁"을 공격하면서 불을 뿜는 총을 목격한 눈동자에 촛불이 아른거렸다. 우아한 복장과 거울로 써도될 은식기에도 불구하고, 미하일은 구닥다리 백군의 꼭두각시에 지나지 않았다. "차르"의 대답을 기다리면서 마트코프스키는 포크로 우둘투둘한 스테이크를 맛보았다. 좋진 않지만 나쁘지도 않군.\n\n미하일은 씹고 삼킨뒤 수저를 내려놓았다. 그는 말하기 전에 냅킨으로 입을 닦았다. 와인 한잔을 마시면서 그는 마트코프스키를 바라보았다. 그의 시선은 딱딱하고 고요했다. "네," 미하일은 평가를 전하기 위해 자세를 바로했다. "괜찮은 저녁이군요." 마트코프스키가 그에게 미소를 지었다. 그가 주저하는 차르에 대해 들은바에 따르면, 미하일은 결코 거짓말할 사람은 아니었다. 정통성은 별로 없지만, 미하일은 전선의 수많은 군주주의자와 파시스트에겐 없는 한가지를 가지고있었다. 가시. 그는 한모금을 마셨다. 조용히 잔을 내려놓으며 미하일이 말했다. "마트코프스키씨, 이 변변찮은 죄수에게 질문하는걸 즐기시는거 같군요."\n\n"당신 생각을 말씀해주십시오," 이 시점에서 식사가 끝난 마트코프스키가 말했다. "'폐하'."\n\n"알게됐습니다. 러시아에서의 제 지위가 더... 보잘것 없어 졌다는걸." 미하일이 빙그레 웃었다. "애당초 잘된일은 아니지만, 잘됐군요." 궁중예절에 어긋나는 반항적인 행동인 등 기대기를 하며 그는 깊고 무거운 한숨을 내쉬었다. "그래서 이제 저는 어떻게 되는거죠?"\n\n마트코프스키가 그를 응시하며 숙고했다. 이 "차르"는 잠재적 위험요소다. 미하일은 권력을 향한 위험한 도전자가 될 수 있다. 반면 러시아 파시스트당 내에서 군주주의 물결은 빠르게 사그라들고 있었다. 얼마안가 아무도 미하일의 주장을 진지하게 받아들이지 않을 것이고, 그를 러시아에서 멀리 떨어진 곳으로 망명보내는건 신중하고 품위있는 결정이 될 수 있다. 마트코프스키가 입을 열었다."

 magexp.2.desc: "Matkovsky reclined in his seat, smoking a cigar: a luxury in the chaos of Russia. He drew deep from it, its embers bathing the room in orange light. In one quick gasp, he expelled all of it out, letting his lungs bask in the warmth of the fumes and smoke. It had been an excellent day. As the Vozhd, he recognized that his work would never cease, but the heights! Oh, the heights that he had reached. From the underling of a madman into the head of the new Anti-Bolshevik Front. He snorted. Life was absurd; life was good.\n\nIn front of him was no alcohol, no whiskey, no vodka. He was drunk from another substance that had addicted him since the beginning of his career. Photo albums, in black and white, as well as in color, filled the surface of his desk. From the times of the old RFP in Harbin to the first incursion to Siberia, he had it all. Here he was, standing next to Rodzaevsky and Semyonov. There he was, inspecting the troops in the name of his old master, their black uniforms standing in contrast against a frozen background. He was young then. A true believer. A wry and sorrowful smile rose on his lips. If only men did not change. His mind wandered over the photographs, searching in vain for that turn in destiny that would perhaps have preserved their brotherhood. He found none.\n\nHe drew on his cigar again. His eyes wandered to the dusty, untouched gramophone in the corner of the room. Matkovsky stood up from his seat, and the Vozhd left the room."

 magexp.3.t: "The Fate of Wild Mitch"
 magexp.3.desc: "Today was inspection day. Draped in a black fur coat, Matkovsky looked at the ships in the harbor as they brought over supplies and arms from America. He could see his breath stirring in front of him, in white, flaky pieces of air. The port had smelled the same, bearing an odor of brine and rotten fish, with a subtle tang of salt above it all. Petlin and Pavlov went up and down the piers, their silhouettes dark against the pale, weak morning light.\n\nA random thought struck him. They had not found WerBell's body. Try as he might, with his men spread out across the tundras and forests of Siberia, he could not find him. He sighed and breathed the scent of the sea. Wherever the mercenary was, he did not care. Dead or alive, WerBell was out of his way. He stepped forward and strode onto the docks.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomewhere in the world, a soft rock tune played in the background of a tropical cafe, overlooking a beach. A gruff, balding man sat in the corner, reading a newspaper, his cup of coffee untouched. He had to settle for cigarettes. He had fun in some exotic locale recently, and it was a crying shame that it ended. Fucking fascists. First they wouldn't pay, and now they kicked him out. What had the world come down to? He shook his head. No more honest employers these days, it seemed.\n\nHe put the papers down. For the first time since the morning, he tasted the coffee. Mud. It was time to look for new places, new horizons. He left some money on the table, accounting for tips, and left the cafe, cigarette in mouth."

 magexp.4.desc: "Transmission 02, Agent Mason, currently stationed in Magadan.\n\nSubject: The Growing Situation of the Far East: an Overview\n\nContent:\n\nFollowing the last report issued, training of the Magadan forces under Matkovsky proceeded smoothly. Surplus arms from the U.S. arsenals distributed among the soldiers have had an incredible effect, and the officer training has borne fruit. I can say without hesitation that the Vozhd's army is the most advanced in the Far Eastern territories; praise only checked by the old, military adage: they still have room to grow. The prospects of the Vozhd's "Crusade", - a term he insists on to no end - seems bright.\n\nContinuing from the last report, the RFP in Magadan has defeated their counterparts in Amur. Along with this development, they quickly broke the truce they had with the Tsarists in Chita and toppled the Tsar there. In one fell swoop, Matkovsky has succeeded in reunifying the old Anti-Bolshevik Front, albeit by force. Barring other emergent factions in the area, we are confident in saying that the Vozhd currently possesses the strongest forces in the East in terms of personnel and industrial capacity.\n\nHowever, we feel the need to qualify this series of rapid progress. There remains another significant force in the Far East: the Reds and the hardline RFP. The only main concern that the RFP and U.S. personnel note are the rumors from the Northern Siberia, of a religious leader amassing power among the tribes there. Though the probability of the RFP's victory remains high, we recommend further and closer inspection of regional developments. Mason out."
 magexp.4.a: "There is still much to be done."
 
 magexp.5.t: "Learning from the Past"
 magexp.5.desc: "Petlin studied the map before him. A dull, unadorned picture save for roughly drawn borders between "states" that competed for dominance in the Russian Far East. For now, there were only two significant contenders, with the communists marked in red and new, rejuvenated Russian Fascist Party in blotches of black and brown. He laid his fingers on the lines that demarked the boundaries between the two mortal enemies. In the dark cold of his office, he could feel the heat rise to his touch, as decades of hatred and enmity burned in the frontlines.\n\nA thud. Petlin didn't mind it. It was probably an aide stumbling their way through the dark. He looked outside the windows of his little room. The night was bright, with momentary gaps of darkness, as the clouds conspired to keep the light of the full moon for themselves. In the coming days - he did not know when, maybe in a week or a month - would be the days of another confrontation. He sighed. If only there were another way. A knock on the door woke him up from his reverie.\n\n"Coffee, sir?" an aide said, bringing a tray full of the hot black liquid, steam rising from the cups, "I thought you wanted some, as I made some for the men."\n\n"Put it on my desk," he said, breathing a sigh of relief. At least, it wasn't the Vozhd, come to check up on his work. "Mind the map." The aide gingerly placed Petlin's cup on the northern edges of the map, its fragrant fumes spreading its way through the room. As he lifted the tray, however, he knocked it over, spilling the coffee. The aide hurriedly drew his handkerchief, but Petlin stopped him. The damage was already done. No amount of wiping would ever clean the map.\n\nThe aide withdrew from the room, profusely apologizing all the while. As Petlin examined the stain, however, he remembered the rumors from the north, of a heretic amassing his forces to free the Siberians from the tyranny of fascism and communism. While the blot expanded and absorbed more and more of the paper, Petlin found his mind wandering. Perhaps this was an omen."

 magexp.6.t: "First Reports"
 magexp.6.desc: "Oleg leaned on a tree, using his pencil to scribble out notes for a report to the Vozhd's new State Intelligence Agency. As a member of the Siberian Rangers, it was perhaps unsurprising that he was handpicked for a field position in the SIA. He had to be careful not to press the paper too harshly against the tree bark, or he would tear the fragile and thin piece of grey paper apart. The notes themselves were simple, what he'd seen that day, the weather and geographical conditions, as well as the dispositions of the nearby locals.\n\nThe last part troubled Oleg more than any other. He did not like talking to people. He'd sooner crawl into the trenches of the enemy, evading mines and barbed wire, with machine guns raining fire upon him than talk to a bumpkin who couldn't even get their dialect right. Still, through the rugged surface, he managed to write a tiny bit of what he'd seen and heard of the locals. The data was probably insignificant, but he didn't care. He had done what was asked of him and done it brilliantly. He even talked to one or two of the less obnoxious farmers out there in the wilds. Finishing his writing, he shoved the paper into his pockets and sat down. It was time for a moment of rest. He took out a roughly rolled cigarette and lit it.\n\nIn the hands of the SIA, individual data was useless. Collectively, however, they might be the force that decided the battle. He dragged the cigarette out, letting the smoke cloud and cleanse his mind. After this, Oleg would go into the offices of the SIA and type up his report, drawing up conclusions and recommending courses of action for the higher-ups. He would rather be in the Siberian Rangers still, but maybe this life was good enough."
 magexp.6.a: "Thus ran the cogs of the Vozhd's new eyes and ears."
 
 magexp.7.t: "The Last Sentry"
 magexp.7.desc: "The truck ran into the Siberian countryside, carrying on its back five men: four in garbs of soldiers and equipped as such, and the fifth a blindfolded man, his clothes being threadbare rags on the edge of tearing apart. It was early morning, and the roadside snow lay in thick clumps, a fair bit of distance away from the woods to which the vehicle was headed. Occasionally they would come upon a bump on the road, and the four had to lift the blindfolded man back to his seat.\n\nTo their relief, the latter was silent. The voice that had proclaimed liberation for the workers of Russia from atop the radiowaves had held back, its will broken. He could do nothing now, his eyes shut, his hands tied behind his back - his followers lay dead in the fields, and whatever remained of his legacy would thaw like snow come the next spring.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, a random spot in the middle of Russia designated as the "execution point." Opening the cargo bed, they took the blind man and brought him out by the elbow, setting him down, gently as they can, to a patch of snow-covered soil. Then, they made him stand and walked him forward, to somewhere he did not know. An atheist all his life, he confessed that he regretted nothing, and the calm stillness of the dawn greeted the eerie silence of his heart. He did not need the opiate of the masses; his pain was his own.\n\nThey took the blindfold off him, and the sunlight shocked him. How many days had it been? How many months, years - how much time? They stopped, and he knelt. His eyes remained fixated on the sky above.\n\nThey read out his sentence. Rifles clacked, and all ends pointed to his head. "By order of the Vozhd of the Russians," a voice read out loud, somewhere in front of him, "I sentence you, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin," he was ready. "To exile!" He pointed his head down and looked around him, lost. The guards gave him a revolver, two bullets, a coat, and some black bread. After that, they departed.\n\nHe wanted to laugh, and he giggled. Soon, however, all was silent, except for a lonely, deprived sobbing."
 magexp.7.a: "Cruel mercy."
 
 magexp.8.t: "The Vozhd on the Radio"
 magexp.8.desc: "The soldiers of the army sat in their canteen, waiting for the steady pace of the staff to serve their food. It was nothing much, given the soil of Siberia, but what was there was enough. Some thick soup and black bread was their dinner that night. Usually, they would wait in a line - tonight was special. An officer brought a radio to the frontmost table, for tonight, the Vozhd was on the airwaves, preparing to deliver an address to the people of the Far East. It was silent, save for the clatter of plates and the slosh of liquid soup as the servers lowered their ladles unto dishes. No one touched their food.\n\nA wave of patriotic music swept over the barracks. A voice, that of their dear Vozhd, Mikhail Matkovsky, spoke, booming and echoing through the room. "Good evening, the people of Russia!" he said, "tomorrow, past midnight, a new age begins. The Reds, long traitors to the virtues of the Russian people, have been defeated. Their armies lay dead in the fields, their ideologues, their party, their presidium, their pretensions to legitimacy, all scattered to the four winds." A semblance of cheer broke out within the ranks, although everything stayed calm. The clattering and the sloshing continue between the spaces of Matkovsky's words.\n\n"My loyal soldiers, militant and martial, the armed wing of the Russian Fascist Party, the true heroes of the proletariat, have broken through the darkness that had caged and jailed Russia for so long." A patter of claps joined the clatter and slosh. "They shall be the vanguard of a new revolution - a revolution not brought about by the necessities of inhumane ideologies, but for a renewal, a rejuvenation, for a new, for a powerful Russia to take her place once again among nations!"\n\nThe patter of hands, fingers, and palms joined together, a storm that drowned all the other noises. A cry here, a cry there acting as the thunderous rods that broke the atmosphere; the night was complete."
 magexp.8.a: "A lively evening, to be sure."
 
 magexp.9.t: "The Life of Judas"
 magexp.9.desc: "It was almost evening when Zakhar finished. He sat in his scriptorium, a candle by his side, prepared for the inevitable night. The sun hadn't yet set, but it was best to be ready when it did. His pen scribbled on the creamy, expensive paper that the Vozhd had brought for him, a generosity that matched the grandiose scale of his commission: the history of Christianity in the Far East. With each stroke, he struck the thought and the memory of how he came under Mikhail Matkovsky's service, a story that he - and perhaps only he and God - knew. He gritted his teeth, vowing to carry the tale to his grave. Each man bore a different cross, and this was his: not to die in honor but to live in shame.\n\nHis pen halted upon reaching the Fifties and the Sixties. Here, he sighed. For the sake of posterity, perhaps the future would do better not knowing the crimes done to reach a better age. Aside from the general chaos of Russia, he found himself stumped. Other than the obvious and apparent, there were no notable events that had happened in the Far East. He would have to consult his archives, documents, and books. Perhaps there he would be able to forge a narrative convincing enough, real enough, that there would be none who would question it. He opened the first book, a baptismal record he had set on the table, and began reading, leafing through its pages to find and secure the desired truth.\n\nWithin the first few pages, the black bars started to appear. A certain Father, whose name was blotted out by thick, messy ink, had baptized hundreds in a village - the name blotted, struck out of living memory. Zakhar recognized his handiwork. He had to do it in a hurry. It had been a hard choice, but he could not let the integral history of the monastery disappear. Zakhar remembered the Father, a man who undertook the difficult mission of proselytizing to the tribes in the north. Nobody thought that he would return, yet he did - bringing not peace but the sword. Zakhar rode out with him to the south, an aide in his war council, from the beginning until the end.\n\nHe stepped outside, the weight of warm and bright memories twisted into darkness. The laughter, the tears, seemed to burn in his ears, a ringing sound that wouldn't cease. Then he saw the graves, their silhouettes dark against the dying sun. Rows upon rows, for miles upon miles. He saw the crosses of his comrades, men and women, that they bore in life, and that now they carry unto death. Crosses of rough-hewn wood, unmarked, and unnamed. He collapsed to his knees. Perhaps today, too, he would fail to bear his."
 magexp.9.a: "For a few pieces of silver more."
 
 magexp.10.t: "The NKVD Papers"
 magexp.10.desc: "Dmitry watched as they stacked the papers from Yagoda's offices. Piles upon piles of flickering, faint white pages weighted down by rocks so the Siberian wind would not scatter them in all directions. Yagoda himself had either died or disappeared; the Vozhd would not care for either. Preferably, the Vozhd would have had him shot - but fate did not will Matkovsky to do so. Dmitry nursed the stump that had once been his arm. He still felt it, at night, grasping at imaginary objects, gripping the handle of imagined doors, and brushing against walls that only belonged in his mind.\n\nIvan was out there, somewhere. The quiet bastard didn't even accept any form of thanks from him. A single grunt, and hands that shooed away any cigarettes, canned food, or money. Dmitry's prosthetic lay beside him, on the grass, its sockets yearning for an owner to wield them. Not now. It had been some time since the doctors amputated his gangrenous, infected arms in a dank, full medical tent. The morphine they provided had not been enough, and he still dreaded to think of the night.\n\nTurning to see the pile, he saw a guard in RFP uniform walk towards it carrying a can of petroleum. Others carried leaves, branches, and whatever flammable material they could find and smothered the pile with it. The heavy odor of petrol reeked as the guard first opened the can and then poured it on the papers, shuffling away from it, leaving a trail. Then he lit a match, and all of them watched as the fire caught the path fixed for it, and gently set the records ablaze.\n\nDmitry observed the flames burn with disinterest. What had transpired between the Vozhd of the Russians and the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, he did not care. He felt the flames brush his face, its heat intensifying by every second. He sat, massaging his stump, and watched the past crumble to ashes before his eyes."
 magexp.10.a: "The future is now."
 
 magexp.11.t: "The Charter of Magadan"
 magexp.11.desc: "Petlin watched as Matkovsky and the rest of his Cabinet took their seats at the round table on the highest floor of the RFP building. He followed them, sitting right beside Matkovsky, a mere ambassador lifted to the position of the right-hand man. He was the lifeline between the Americans and the party, after all. A chandelier set the room alight, an unfamiliar sight to Petlin's eyes. The Cabinet usually met during the day, not at night.\n\nOnce they were all seated, Matkovsky turned to him, mouthing, "That all of them?" He gave the Vozhd a nod, who then stood up and coughed, silencing the whispering that had commenced among the ministers. "Gentlemen," Matkovsky said, "I come to you here today with a bold proposal," he tapped his fingers on the table, going around the table, counter-clockwise. "As per the recommendations from our dear friend Nikolay Petlin," he pointed at Petlin as if his point needed clarification, "who has proposed a radical change: a shift that would perhaps transform the very nature of the party." Arriving at the other end of the table he stopped, before continuing, "I understand that many of us here, including me, Petlin, Pavlov, and many others have served the cause of Russia ever since the creation of the party in Harbin." Striding forward, he raised his voice, "However, the times have changed. The Party needs, forgive me for the trite expression, to move on with the times."\n\nReturning to his former seat, he said, "I propose to do away with the affectations of the past. To..." his voice trailed away, before once again finding purchase, "escape the shadow of Rodzaevsky." He raised his head and looked at every man seated in their eyes, "We shall sign the charter of Magadan. Petlin, our dear friend," his hands grasped Petlin's shoulders, "has kindly written a new constitution for us." He let go, before clapping his hands together, "I am sure that all of you have read it. Now, I propose that from today henceforth the Russian Fascist Party is no more - it is now the National Labor Party of Russia." He paused, gauging every man there for their worth, "All in favor say aye."\n\nThere was no dissent."
 magexp.11.a: ""Aye.""

 magexp.12.t: "Exiling the Tsar"
 magexp.12.desc: "In the fire of the Revolution, Bukharin had the royal family shot. They were a threat, they were deemed a rallying symbol for the old order.\n\nIn the confusion of the Far East, had things gone differently, Rodzaevsky would have had the tsar shot. For he was a rival, a hated enemy of the new Russian order, a personal insult to the animal that had called himself the Vozhd.\n\nThe true Vozhd looks out across the table, meal finished, and regards the tsar. The decision was clear – and the decent thing can be the prudent one as well. "Mikhail Romanov, you will leave Russia. I trust you know why."\n\nHe nods slowly, face flickering from disbelief to something like satisfaction or relief. "I... see. Exile, then." The last sentence is murmured softly, perhaps not meant for Matkovsky to hear.\n\n"Exile." Matkovsky nods sharply, swirling the last of his wine around as he regards the odd tsar. "You will leave your homeland and not return. You will go to... Australia, was it not?"\n\nMikhail nods again with eyes downcast, fingers drumming on the table for moment. "It was, yes." He looks up to catch Matkovsky's eyes, "Thank you. I-" He pauses, and Matkovsky knows the erstwhile tsar too well to think it's to think of a flowery thanks. "You did not have to."\n\n"No, I didn't." The Vozhd allows himself the ghost of a smile, "But I did."\n\nIn the relative peace of Magadan, with the long road to Moscow stretching out before him, the Vozhd allows himself mercy. The tsar will soon be an irrelevance, after all."
 magexp.12.a: "The new Vozhd can be generous."

 magexp.13.t: "House Arrest"
 magexp.13.desc: "The world is on the brink, the motherland is at the cusp of a crossroads in her history, and the double eagle has a certain appeal in these times. Mikhail Matkovsky allows himself one moment to consider the decent thing, and sets it aside. The long road west has more than a few pretenders to the imperial throne, after all.\n\nMatkovsky looks the erstwhile tsar of Chita in the eye, and replies. "There is a house near Lake Baikal, and you will be placed there with a suitable escort."\n\n"House arrest." The obvious is stated with a sort of resignation. "All the same, though..."\n\n"It is a mercy." The Vozhd finishes the sentence, words hanging heavy with implications. The animal of Amur would have shot him, as would any of the communists. "You will be well-treated, I assure you."\n\n"Thank you." The words are not without bitterness, but bitterness was not unexpected. The tsar looks at the Vozhd with mingled resignation and relief, that he isn't to be made a spectacle and yet not to be free.\n\nThe light seems harsh, the conversation turning to Siberia, and the civil coolness of the Vozhd seeming to drain any protest out of Mikhail.\n\nMikhail Matkovsky sits with the last of the old order, and remembers that it can still inspire. The eagle will be caged, at Lake Baikal. The tsar will stay in Russia, until the new Russia that the Vozhd is building will no longer have any faith in his legacy."
 magexp.13.a: "The Vozhd has mercy, but not overmuch."

 magreg.1.t: "Sign Up and Fall In"
 magreg.1.desc: "Young Sergey rubbed his eyes as he woke to the sound of the loudspeaker out the window. Outside, a truck drove by and a voice blared from its mounted loudspeaker:\n\n"Soratniki! Your Vozhd is calling you to a higher purpose! Though you may not have helped vanquish the false heirs to Harbin, you now have the opportunity to achieve a far greater glory: The reunification of our Russian land! Our friends in America have sent you the finest arms and equipment, but now we need you!"\n\nSergey pondered these words as he went downstairs to eat his breakfast. His parents had made him a simple kasha, and as he ate he could hear the truck driving by again.\n\n"Our victory over the traitors, subversives and lunatics is the first step towards a triumph over the Hun! With your help, we shall celebrate New Year's in Moscow! With your help, we shall celebrate Christmas in Kiev! And with your help, the world will stand in awe of Russia's majesty once more! Enlist with the National Republican Army today, and our Motherland will be united tomorrow!"\n\nSergey knew his parents wouldn't approve, but after his breakfast he hurried to city hall to find the local recruiter. His parents would just have to miss his 18th birthday this year."

 magreg.2.t: "Daydreams"
 magreg.2.desc: "Gone were the days of old. The failures of the Tsarists, the Communists, and yes, even the failures of fascism. Or at least; Rodzavesky's ill begotten Germanophilic version. Mikhail had painted over all of their troublesome antics with a single big, red brush. Yes, the far eastern reaches were secured, but it would not be enough.\n\nIt would never be enough. Magadan had been a poor home for the émigrés who had fled there, hoping for a new place. A new home. A new Russia. And now, a step had been taken towards this new dream. To think it was all coming within his grasp...\n\nOf course, he still had work to do. Control had to be solidifed, the Americans had to be sated, and the future had to be secured. But - his dream kept coming back to him. A free Russia, different than all that had come before it. A new place, where everything was better. Everything was calmer. A place Russians could truly call home - no matter the price that would come in making it.\n\nA new, hopeful land. Peace through order; order through strength. This was the maxim they needed. Strong. Firm. Uncompromising.\n\nAnd despite all his glances to the forms on his desk, he couldn't get over the thoughts dancing in his head."
 magreg.2.a: "The future waits for no one. Back to work."
 
 magreg.3.t: "A Free Radio?"
 magreg.3.desc: "Though the government has finally agreed to subsidize Radio Free Magadan, this decision doesn't necessarily come without a price for the radio.\n\nMany Laborists have called for the radical reform of the radio and the replacement of the hosts (who have quickly grown on people, to the surprise of everyone except perhaps Sergei.) This would be done to ensure the loyalty of the radio to the state and make it a useful tool for spreading fascist truth. Of course, as neither Sergei nor Vasily are thought of very highly by the Laborists, with some whispering that the feeling is mutual, they would probably have to be... disposed of, to ensure they make no attempts at subversion as revenge for their dismissal.\n\nOn the other hand, reformists have called for the hosts to remain due to their popularity, and the maintenance of the freedom of their content for the radio to live up to its name, with mandated changes only as necessary as to improve the efficiency of the radio's operation.\n\nAll that remains is for the final decision to be made."

 magreg.4.t: "An Atypical Meeting"
 magreg.4.desc: "It was a typical meeting for the RNLP. Nothing too large on today's agenda for the Vozhd, but appearances were important. Mikhail strutted in accepting the greetings of a few Laborists, the glances of several Reformists, and - the silence of the room largely. It was quiet today. A small miracle - not having to deal with the bickerings of his own party. Nikolay Petlin came to the podium, and Mikhail waited to hear what was first on the agenda.\n\n"The first order of business on the agenda; the arrest of Mikhail Matkovsky." Nikolay stated calmly, with a single bit of iron to his tone.\n\nThe Vozhd froze, and then blinked. Had he heard that right? Arrest? Him? For a moment, he assumed it was a joke. A single bit of dry humor from a man who wanted his position. However, no one in the party protested. No one in the party laughed, or raised their voice. The Laborists he had greeted just minutes ago turned pale, and the room remained utterly silent.\n\n"For numerous crimes against both Russia, and the Russian people..." Nikolay continued, but Mikhail was no longer listening. How could this have happened? How did this happen? It wasn't possible. It wasn't. But as he stood there with a dumbfounded expression, shock written across his face, the guards moved. Not to arrest Petlin, or to shoot him on the spot.\n\n"Traitor." The former Vozhd whispered once quietly, as the guards moved to restrain him. "TRAITOR! YOU - BASTARD! You and your Reformers, every last one of you a bastard! You can't - " Arms wrapped around his own. Rage, fear, and sorrow compressed into a single scream.\n\nNone of his own clique look at him as he's dragged away. The guards ignore his pleas. And Nikolay Petlin, his spineless foreign minister, his subordinate, his replacement looks him in the eye the entire time he's dragged out."
 magreg.4.a: ""... do this to me. You can't...do this...to me.""
 
 magreg.5.t: "The Tolling of the Bell"
 magreg.5.desc: "Petlin sat, metaphorically and physically, on the edge of his seat in a leather armchair in his study. He had already heard the doors slamming, the engines roaring like hellhounds off to drag him down to his final judgement, and the boots of soldiers slamming the ground as they made their way up his driveway. He knew what was coming, he had for weeks. Between the ominous looks from laborists, his allies disappearing, and the Vozhd's stranglehold growing ever tighter, Petlin knew a reckoning was coming. The death of any hope of freedom in Magadan was at hand. Yet, despite how much he had prepared himself mentally, the event still shook the man to his core.\n\nPetlin heard downstairs his door coming off its hinges unceremoniously as Matkovsky's thugs stormed his home. He stood up, awaiting the three armed men rushing up his staircase and into his study. As he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, suddenly his breath was stolen from him as the primed-for-combat soldier at the front tackled him at the waist. Dizzy and in pain, Petlin was rolled onto his back and shackles were snapped onto his wrists as his charges were read out.\n\nTreason. A believable charge, an expected charge. It still stung to hear that all his efforts to improve his country had earned him the title of traitor.\n\nThe traitor was dragged out into the street. His neighbours stayed indoors so as to not incur the wrath of the Vozhd. Instead, they watched through their blinds as Petlin was thrown into the back of an unmarked truck. It sped off down the street, never to return to this place. Through his blistering headache, Petlin had only one thought."

 magreg.6.t: "Musings of a Sailor"
 magreg.6.desc: "The Shchuka's were old boats, once built as undersea killers, few had been used in their intended role. The Reds in Petropavlovsk had converted many for smuggling, large sections torpedo rooms stripped of their cylindrical warheads, replaced with cargo holds and additional accommodation. Now in the hands of the Siberian National Republic, the process was completed, the last vestiges of their warfighting capability having being stripped from their hulls.\n\nAbramov looked over the half dozen or so vessels now tied up at Magadan's port, the blue-gray waters of the Sea of Okhotsk lapping at their hulls. He checked over the manifest, most of the vessels would be assigned to smuggling from Petropavlovsk or Magadan to Alaska, providing the Republic with a steady stream of income and hard currency. Some of the older vessels would be laid up, their hulls a source of spares for the rest of the fleet, and one would be used as a training ship, educating a new generation of submariners in the art of surviving under the sea. Taking a glance at the setting sun, Abramov walked back to his new office.\n\nPouring himself a mug of coffee, he let his mind drift back to the meetings in Manchuria, the reclamation of the Far East, and the breakup of the Harbin Three. Times were simpler back then when they had Yagoda's Supreme Soviet keeping everyone on the same page, but the differences and the disagreements eventually grew too deep to paper over. He was amazed he'd managed to survive the cutthroat politicking long enough to throw his lot in with Matkovsky.\n\nNoticing his mug was empty, Abramov moved to refill it, he had enough reminiscing for one day, there was work to do."

This full report (see attached) will present comprehensive breakdowns of diplomatic opportunities that can or may be exploited by the National Republic for gain, economic or otherwise, in pursuit of this goal. Regional summaries follow.\n\nAsia: Primary prospects involve the support or sponsorship of anti-Japanese organizations in Manchuria and elsewhere. Interference from Japanese-aligned interests considered highly likely.\n\nNorth America: Primary outreach likely towards the United States, leveraging previous connections established by the state. Potential gains substantial. Secondary targets include Canada and Mexico.\n\nSouth America: Prospects remain limited at the current time.\n\nEurope: Prospects remain limited at the current time as a result of overwhelming German influence.\n\nAfrica: Prospects remain limited at the current time.\n\nOceania: Australia and New Zealand considered highly likely prospects, owing to shared interests regarding Japanese influence.

 magreg.8.t: "The Motherland Beckons"
 magreg.8.desc: "Diplomats from the Siberian National Republic have arrived in Washington in the last few days, meeting with officials from several agencies. Normally ambassadors from the states competing to reunify Russia are seeking diplomatic recognition, trade deals, or weapons, and usually all three. These men have come to America for a different purpose though. With the reunification of eastern Siberia, they report that the process of "stabilizing and rebuilding the Motherland" has begun. Citing this new stability and their long history of cooperation with the United States, they have requested permission to work with several Russian expat organizations in America. Their hope is to encourage Russian refugees and their families to emigrate back to Siberia and "heal the wounds the Nazis inflicted on the Russian people."\n\nNormally we would hesitate to allow representatives of a foreign government to work in the United States with the goal of persuading people to leave the country, but these are not normal circumstances. The Siberian National Republic, despite its authoritarian tendencies, has shown strong interest in aligning with the OFN, and if we play our cards right it could become a firm ally in a region of vital importance. The SNR has a strong opposition to Nazism and Communism, and while it would be easier to work with the Japanese they have instead courted us, and it would be unwise to ignore their overtures. In addition to all of this, the Russian emigre community in the United States is small and it is unlikely many will leave California or New York to return to Siberia. Those who do choose to go would likely return to their homeland either way.\n\nWith the downsides of accepting so far outweighed by the potential risks of rejecting the Russians, it has been decided that we should allow them in. We wish them luck on their mission. They'll need it to convince anyone to trade the greatest nation on earth for some arctic tundra."

I know you don't but I promise you'll like it there."\n\n"But all my friends are here."\n\n"You'll make lots of new friends in Russia sweetheart."\n\n"I don't want to make friends with stinky Russian kids!"\n\nThose words left Igor speechless. He knew his daughter was only seven, and didn't understand the significance of what she'd just said, but she had just made his decision a certainty. He was Russian. His wife was Russian. His daughter had been born in Sacramento and had never been outside of the United States, but as far as he was concerned she was Russian too, and now she was saying Russians were stinky. Had some of the kids at school said that? Knowing their parents, it wouldn't have surprised Igor. They were just like everyone else in this country, always looking at him and Sofia with that uniquely American mix of pity and contempt. He was sick of it. When he'd heard about the Siberian Repatriation Program at the Russian Cultural Center last month it seemed like his prayers for a way out had finally been answered.\n\n"Why do we have to leave America?"\n\n"Because Russia is safe again sweetheart, and now we need to help make her strong again too."\n\n"But I like America. I don't care about Russia one bit."\n\n"I know.""

This is Magadan."\n\n"Is Vladivostok this cold?"\n\n"No sweetheart, it definitely isn't."\n\n"Why can't we go there then?"\n\nIgor looked out from the airport window across the icy fields and snow-blanketed buildings. It was miserably cold outside and the airport's insulation was far from perfect, but he still felt a warmth in his belly. It was the same warmth he felt when he met Sofia after arriving in San Francisco in the ancient year of 1947 or when he'd first held Sasha in his arms in the hospital in Sacramento. There was some indescribable joy in seeing all of the signs and labels written in Russian and confirming that he could still read his first language. Even hearing the chatter of all of the other people at the airport was an unexpected joy. The familiar words and syllables brought back so many memories of better times, before everything had gone south.\n\n"Papa?"\n\nSasha's question snapped Igor back to reality. "I'm sorry sweetheart, what did you say?"\n\n"Why can't we go to Vladivostok instead?"\n\n"Oh." He hesitated for just a moment. "The Japanese control it."\n\n"Darn." Sasha replied. Igor could only nod."
 magreg.10.a: "Welcome back Igor. Welcome home Sasha."

 magreg.11.t: "Homecoming"
 magreg.11.desc: "At first it was barely noticeable, just a few scared and hopeful faces mixed among the crowded docks and airports of Siberia. Every week a few more of those faces would arrive, presenting their passports and documents to customs workers who would wave them through an expedited arrival process. At first it was barely a trickle, but soon that trickle had grown into a stream and the stream into a flood of new immigrants arriving in Magadan, Kamchatka, and Irkutsk.\n\nFor most of these new arrivals this is an opportunity they have waited decades for, a chance to return to the homeland that was stolen from them decades ago. For others it is a chance to start over, to build a new life in a new nation where their past is only as important as they choose it to be. For a few it is a chance to see the Motherland they grew up hearing stories of but never dared visit themselves. With the warlords vanquished and order restored to the east, they can finally see the nation their families loved so dearly.\n\nWith the number of immigrants increasing by the day, more customs agents have been hired and the visa application process has been streamlined to reduce delaying arrivals and integration as much as possible. All across the globe the children of Mother Russia have heard the wonderful news: the nation is rebuilding, and the time for all Russians to do their duty has come at last. Every day more people arrive at our shores to answer the call to action, to build a new life, or even to retake an old one."

 magreg.12.t: "The Vozhd's Venture"
 magreg.12.desc: ""Are you almost done with the preparations?" Matkovsky hissed at the scurrying pair of aides- really just RNLP members with nothing better to do conscripted into the task- gathering what little luggage Matkovsky intended to bring as well as necessary papers. As they quickly apologized and redoubled their efforts, Matkovsky huffed and turned back to his desk before him, where he was attempting to complete what work he could before the trip.\n\nIt was hard to imagine that by tomorrow, he would be in America, self-declared land of the free and, much more importantly to Matkovsky, a potentially crucial ally against the Japanese dogs. With the aid of the Americans, celebrations might be held in old great Vladivostok yet, and that alone was reason enough to attempt to form this relationship with Washington. As long as they were of use, the Americans could try to push their senseless ideals onto him all they liked if it made them feel better, not that it would do them any good in the end.\n\nWhen at last his things were packed, Matkovsky gave in with a sigh, putting his pen down and getting up to head to bed. He was too distracted by his thoughts to properly get work done, and he needed to be rested for the meeting. If all went well, Russia would have a very powerful friend in the world, one who could change everything for her."
 magreg.12.a: "The dreams of Harbin carried to Washington."

 magreg.13.t: "A Visit from the Vozhd"
 magreg.13.desc: "Washington's foreign policy bubble is abuzz in response to the news that the US has visitors: a delegation from the Siberian National Republic, a statelet which recently consolidated the easternmost lands of Russia under its control. The star of the show is the so-called "Vozhd", Mikhail Matkovsky, a leader whose cunning and drive are renowned in Russia expert circles. Matkovsky is controversial, however; his critics accuse him of running what is in effect a fascist dictatorship, antithetical to the idea that American foreign policy should seek to uphold democratic values. Less idealistic elements of the national security community point to Matkovsky's pragmatism and anti-Japanese sentiment to argue that the SNR could be a valuable ally, and perhaps one that the United States could influence for the better.\n\nThe Vozhd's visit, announced only shortly before his departure, is expected to last several days, with meeting the President being the high point of the affair. For Matkovsky and his men, long fighting for their lives in the frigid Far East, the Washington D.C high life may be a dream come true. For liberal politicians, it signals that their country's attachment to democratic values is far more tenuous than it appears, and several Republican and C-NPP congressmen have already made their objections clear.\n\nMatkovsky's goals are still unclear, but the consensus is that he seeks greater political and economic cooperation with the United States, possibly coupled with military aid. While some on the American side may be willing to hear him out, that fact is contingent on whether he is truly open to reforms, or just another despot ruling over the fallen remains of a great power."
 magreg.13.a: "Mr. Matkovsky, you may have a deal on your hands."
 magreg.13.b: "We do not negotiate with fascists."

 magreg.14.t: "From Magadan to the National Mall"
 magreg.14.desc: "As its various petty fiefdoms give way to genuine countries, Russia is beginning to open up to the outside world. One of the first stops for any erstwhile warlord on his world tour is the United States, and indeed, the Siberian National Republic's Nikolay Petlin is reportedly making his first state visit to Washington. Petlin's history has already made him popular among the American political class; he first took power by toppling the region's authoritarian strongman, Mikhail Matkovsky, and has promised to further democratic reforms as development continues.\n\nIn the Far East, with few inhabitants and fewer resources than it would like, foreign patronage is a vital political concern. Back at home, all eyes are on Petlin, as closer ties with the United States could greatly strengthen its chances of winning the grand Russian power struggle. Closer diplomatic and economic ties are likely the goal of this meeting, with the Holy Grail of military aid for farther off in the future.\n\nPetlin's chances look quite good; with the exception of a few dissenters who question how far the SNR has truly moved from fascism, most of Congress seems open to the idea of expanding relations, and the President has not signalled opposition. His few days in D.C. could mean the beginning of a mutually prosperous relationship — in the meantime, Petlin might take the opportunity to relax a bit in America's comparatively luxurious capital."
 magreg.14.a: "Good relations with democratic nations: that's the American way."
 magreg.14.b: "We shouldn't waste our time with small fry like Petlin."
 
 magreg.131.t: "Taking a Breather"
 magreg.131.desc: "As Mikhail Matkovsky sat down in his D.C. hotel room, he felt aches he didn't even know he had wash away in a wave. They didn't have couches like this at home. Even as the Vozhd, it was a struggle to find comfortable furniture. The phone conveniently sat on a table right next to him, and he decided to make use of the amenities. "Room service?" A short silence.\n\n"What do you need, Mr. Matkovsky?"\n\n"Give me rum." He thought for a moment. "Cuban."\n\n"That'll be right on its way, sir." A few minutes later, he reclined sipping a drink that had been the stuff of dreams just a few years ago. If Rodzaevsky wasn't dead, he would love to have seen his face. His thoughts turned to the day's events. Things had started off poorly; his welcome on the tarmac that morning was marred by the presence of a group of protestors, shouting all sorts of anti-fascist invective. They were lucky they hadn't met him at home. Mid-afternoon, once he was properly settled in, he met with the President for what turned out to be a very productive series of talks, where they discussed a number of topics ranging from the need for cooperation against Japanese aggression to the possibility of expanding economic ties in the future. To questions about political reform, Matkovsky made vague promises about democratization far off into the future, when the internal situation was more stable. The President was a reasonable person, and would naturally understand the delicacy of such matters. At least, that's what the Vozhd hoped.\n\nThe dinner was sumptuous, and Matkovsky very much enjoyed playing the part of the dignitary. He was particularly pleased to give a toast to a world without tyranny, earning substantial applause from those present. All in all, it had been a good enough showing for the Siberian National Republic's return to the world stage. He felt himself drifting off to sleep, and made one final mental note: find out where he could order a chair like this for his office at home."
 magreg.131.a: "A fruitful day, but a busy one."

 magreg.141.t: "A Break from the Excitement"
 magreg.141.desc: "Petlin relaxed in a chair, exhausted from the events of his trip. Letting out a sigh, he wondered if he had done well. Better than Matkovsky would have done, perhaps, but that was low-hanging fruit, and didn't necessarily mean he was successful. Still, he thought as he leaned back into his luxurious seat, feeling his worries wash away, it was a wonder in itself to enjoy finery in a hotel like this. Nothing in Siberia compared. The Americans truly did not know how good they had it.\n\nSpeaking of the Americans, their welcome had certainly warmed him. Russian expatriates and american lovers of democracy alike had cheered his arrival on the tarmac, and Petlin couldn't help but wave to them as he passed with a stupid grin on his face. He felt like a soldier returning home from a victorious war. Once he had been settled in, he had met the president himself for a series of surprisingly productive talks about topics ranging from cooperation against the Japanese aggressors to the expansion of economic ties between Siberia and the United States. When questioned on political reform, Petlin presented a concrete plan of gradual but certain democratization, assuaging the fears of the Americans. Though meeting one of the world's most powerful men in a room had certainly been intimidating, he had turned out to be a reasonable man and soon Petlin's anxieties calmed.\n\nThe dinner that followed the talks was the best meal Petlin had eaten in years, and the applause he earned upon giving a toast to a world without tyranny made him feel like a hero. Petlin felt fairly confident that it made for a strong diplomatic showing to mark the emergence of the Siberian National Republic onto the world stage. Falling asleep where he sat, he began to dream of that feeling of heroism he had quickly come to love."

 magreg.15.t: "A Successful Deal!"
 magreg.15.desc: "Our diplomats' anxious nerves have been calmed by incredible news. Our efforts to negotiate with the United States were a resounding success! Although initially put off by the Siberian National Republic's fascist past, the Americans ultimately decided that having an ally in the Siberian region outweighed other considerations. The recent delegation to Washington appears to have been a significant factor in assuaging their fears, and the President signed onto the deal with little opposition from the rest of the government.\n\nThe agreement between the US and SNR outlines significant political and economic cooperation, the expansion of trade between the two countries, a communication line between both countries' leadership, and a number of other provisions ensuring a firm working partnership for the years to come. Surrounded by rivals, such an opportunity could not have come sooner. Long isolated from the outside world, we finally have a lifeline, and one to a superpower to boot! The mood in Magadan tonight will be celebratory indeed, and promotions in the diplomatic staff are almost guaranteed to come soon."

 magreg.16.t: "The Americans Reject Our Offer"
 magreg.16.desc: "News coming out of the United States has dealt a major blow to the Siberian National Republic's efforts to gain recognition abroad, as the recent deal brokered by our leadership has been completely rejected by the President. Despite a visit by an SNR delegation to Washington D.C., the Americans ultimately decided that closer cooperation was not in their interests, either because of the SNR's history as a derivative of the Russian Fascist Party or because they did not see the value of a client in the remote reaches of Siberia.\n\nWith this decision, our future in international affairs becomes substantially murkier. Perhaps the Americans can be persuaded to reconsider their offer when the SNR controls more of the Russian landmass, but for now we must be ready to fight for Russia's future alone. Without a major international patron, our foreign policy has been significantly weakened, with potentially dire consequences. In Magadan, where many people's hopes rode on further connections with the United States, the mood is grim, and many of our diplomats are undoubtedly being chewed out, or worse."

Before long, their ships will dock in the Port of Magadan bearing great wealth for our regime to use in our civilization of the Siberian wastes. The agreement between our two nations, the American-Siberian Trade Act, formally requires us to grant the Americans access to Siberia's resources in exchange for the immense riches they can deliver in great fleets of ships. The Vozhd, noting the terms of the settlement, was reported to smirk and sit quite comfortably knowing he now has secured formal American support.\n\nBefore long, we expect to see the port stuffed with American vessels hauling tonnes of fuel, arms, supplies, and munitions so we may gain the upper hand against our adversaries in the east. Our time spent foraging for food and stealing equipment from our neighbors in the cover of night is over; we demand prosperity from Siberia and prosperity we shall have! Our American friends will sponsor our moves to civilize the wastes and wilderness into a republic worthy of the name 'Russia'."

On this historic day, we sit with representatives from the Siberian National Republic to strike a deal between our freedom-loving peoples; we will lower our tariffs and grant the Eastern republic preferential treatment over shipping in the North Pacific, and in return they will welcome our money and investment in extracting the valuable resources in the Siberian region.\n\nWhilst congressmen applaud our actions and the American people approve of the law, we are certainly happy to say that the Russians beyond the port of Magadan rejoice to know they have our heart in the fight for freedom. We are told in Siberia that the battles are tough and the winters are cold, but with American guns and fuel their troubles are sure to be few. With the signature of a document and the shake of a hand, a relationship between the United States and the Siberian National Republic has been cemented in law, and the future of our nations extends down the path of freedom against tyranny wherever it may be found."

Whether it is scrounging up what we can from the pillaged resources of our neighbors, or increasing the appeal of illegal shipping to the Port of Magadan, we must work tirelessly from the ground up.\n\nIn this Russia, crazed with pain, we are once again forced to resort to using smuggled goods and arms from Western and Japanese markets to prop up our republic. Faced by enemies from all sides, our failure to secure American support in our struggle against warlordism and the Siberian wilderness are telling of how truly alone we are in our fight for supremacy in this corner of the world.\n\nWith a firm resolve to improve our misfortune, [MAG.GetLeader] turns his eyes to other markets, local and international, to attract the flow of arms and supplies to our domain. If we are to brave the brutality of the Eastern wastes, the Port of Magadan, our lifeline for our regime's governance over the region, must not run dry of foreign goods."
 magreg.19.a: "Let's hope our luck turns for the better."

 magreg.20.t: "Opportunities in Siberia"
 magreg.20.desc: "The Siberian National Republic has reached out across the Pacific to extend its hand to begin diplomatic missions with the nations of Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. Citing tenets of sovereignty and freedom from tyranny, the Eastern republic requests diplomatic relations with nations and leaders who stand against despotism and anarchy, and calls for their support in the war against warlordism in the Siberian wastes.\n\nThe calls also invite international vessels to trade in the Port of Magadan, pumping the Siberian markets full of foreign goods and arms. With a kick-started economy and an army fit to fight, the Siberian National Republic can stand on it's two feet and fight the chaos of anarchy with the support of her international allies. Until then, however, the Russians sit in Magadan praying their calls do not fall on deaf ears, and that support arrives before the Siberian wilderness whittles down their control of the wild Northern continent."
 magreg.20.a: "Agree to trade."
 magreg.20.b: "Not worth the effort."
 
 magreg.21.t: "New Trade Opportunities"
 magreg.21.desc: "Rushing to [MAG.GetLeader]'s desk, returned messages were delivered to Magadan from across the Pacific; we have heard back from our calls for support! The democracies of the free world have offered their hands to establish official diplomatic relations with our republic, and will begin official and formal communications in the next coming weeks.\n\nShipping vessels dock in the icy Port of Magadan bearing the flags of our foreign allies, arriving with hundreds of tonnes of supplies for our young republic. Shaking hands with envoys and international observers, we have most certainly made a name for ourselves throughout the globe and found friends across the great Pacific ocean. We are far from the stable and cement position we work tirelessly towards, but our efforts to civilize and govern Siberia no longer go unnoticed by the observing free world."
 magreg.21.a: "Things are starting to look up."

 magreg.22.t: "Left Hanging"
 magreg.22.desc: "The icy Siberian winds whistled through the docile Port of Magadan. The metal clang of floating buoys rang throughout the bay as the only sound audible amidst the crash of the foamy Pacific waters. With the exception of the occasional rocking smuggler vessel docked in the cold concrete harbor, the waters were empty of the ships from the Free World.\n\nOur cries for aid have been ignored by the 'freedom-loving' peoples of the West, and we are left with none to rely on but ourselves. Thus, we turn inwards, surviving on the limited supplies we can gather from across the wilderness of Siberia. If we are to persist even in the most bitter colds of the East, we must look inwards and find the resources necessary for the preservation of our young republic, lest we descend into icy conflict and warlordism once again."
 magreg.22.a: "We are going to have to make the best with what we have."
 
 magreg.23.t: "Manchurian Candidate"
 magreg.23.desc: "After one last careful look outside to make sure he had not been followed, Aleksandr closed the door to the isolated rural house he now found himself in. Taking a deep breath, he turned around, and took a seat at the table in the cebter of the room. On the other side of the table sat a representative from the so-called Siberian National Republic, flanked on either side by not-so-subtly armed bodyguards. "Now then." The representative spoke softly, almost quietly, and Aleksandr couldn't blame him. When it came to fighting the Japanese, even the walls may as well have ears. "Shall we discuss our aid to you and your compatriots?" With a quick nod from Aleksandr, he continued speaking. "We are willing to provide arms, supplies, funding, and training to your rebels- everything you asked for from us. In exchange, all we ask is that upon the liberation of these territories, that they be joined with our republic. Do you agree to meet that term?"\n\nAleksandr swallowed. He had had little love for Yagoda's clique in Irkutsk, but he did not place much more trust in the squabbling Harbin exiles. But with the Far East united once again, there had never been a more opportune time to throw a wrench in Japanese operations in Manchuria. It wasn't like he and the rest of the insurgents had much choice in the matter, either; without outside support, they stood little chance against the mighty Japanese occupier.\n\nSo be it. "You have yourselves a deal." Aleksandr said at last. "We will unite our people.""
 magreg.23.a: "All that remains is to drop off the supplies."

 magreg.24.t: "To the Future and Beyond"
 magreg.24.desc: "High-ranking officials of the foreign ministry of the Siberian National Republic had gathered around a table, having been called together for a special meeting. They chatted among themselves, but quieted down when the Foreign Minister cleared his throat, and looked to their superior. "Gentlemen," He began. "You have all performed excellently these past months, and I would first like to congratulate each and every one of you."\n\nThough the gathered officials said nothing, knowing not to interrupt the minister's speech, the mood lightened in the room, and proud smiles spread across a few faces. After giving them a moment to process the praise, the foreign minister continued.\n\n"However, more remains to be done. There is the relationship with Washington to be deepened, as well as with the OFN in general. Moreover, retaking Vladivostok and the rest of the southeastern territories remains a priority for this administration. As such, I expect you to continue giving your best efforts these next months as well. Is this understood?" A chorus of agreement came from the seated officials. "Good, then. All of you, dismissed.""
 magreg.24.a: "Russia no longer stands alone."
 
 magreg.25.t: "The Printer of the Dalstroy"
 magreg.25.desc: "Sergey Dmitrievich Solovyev cursed as his hands slipped from the shovel. His hands, long applied to the delicate work required of typesetting, were wholly unsuited to manual labor. That, however, was all he knew he could expect for a very long time.\n\nHe remembered that night in his printing shop. True enough, what he had known to be inevitable had finally occurred. The RFP had discovered his little effort of resistance. But, apparently, he wasn't important enough for them to spend the effort on disappearing. And so he found himself here.\n\nThe Dalstroy was, ostensibly, a public works program. As he and others were now experiencing firsthand, however, the program was little more than a way to imprison dissidents and other 'undesirables,' while working them to the bone besides. He recognized others who had rebelled, in their own small ways, against the Party. And now they were all beside each other, digging trenches for railway ties.\n\nOne day, he knew, things would change. They had to. But for now, seeing the hard-eyed look of an overseer and wanting to avoid the fate he had seen doled out to others who worked too slowly, he put his thoughts aside and picked up the shovel.\n\nThere was work to be done."
 magreg.25.a: "His abilities used in a more appropriate manner."

 magreg.26.t: "Factionalism Rears its Head"
 magreg.26.desc: "The recent party congress has triggered a phenomenon previously unheard of in Magadan's halls of power: the formation of factions. As part of Matkovsky's token reforms to the political system, opportunities to express dissent within the National Labor Party have grown, and a number of politicians have decided to take advantage of these to attempt to change the government's course.\n\nMatkovsky's personal faction, the so-called Laborists, remain the largest bloc. An eclectic mix of moderate fascists, national conservatives, and personal loyalists to the Vozhd, this is the status quo wing of the party, advocating a very slow, moderated political reform under the umbrella of a single-party state. Even with the opposition more visible within the state apparatus, the Laborists hold nearly all of the power in practice, just the way that Matkovsky would like it.\n\nIn many ways, reform only generates more appetite for reform, and this certainly applies in Siberia just as anywhere else. Protesting single-party rule, Nikolay Petlin has formed his own reformist wing of the party, one composed of advocates for a genuinely democratic system. Matkovsky's interest in political change only goes so far; his distrust for Petlin is well known, and the reformists can be expected to be an underrepresented if loud section of the party.\n\nBringing up the rear is the Old Guard, a practically vestigial wing of the party led by fascist hardliners. As there is practically no desire for a Rodzaevsky-style return to extremist ideals among the populace or the political class, the hardliners are isolated and powerless, mostly made up of obscure, ineffectual figures. Many speculate that they are kept around as merely a negative comparison to Matkovsky's "moderate" rule, and scapegoats for his worst decisions.\n\nThis new era signals unprecedented pluralism as well as unprecedented conflict within the party. Only time will tell if the SNR is significantly impacted by the decision."
 magreg.26.a: "New rifts reveal themselves."
 
 magreg.27.t: "The Grand Sobor"
 magreg.27.desc: "Within his office in Magadan, Nikolay Petlin allowed himself a small smile. For the first time in years he could reasonably say that he was hopeful for the future. After months of careful maneuvering he had convinced Matkovsky to allow a primitive legislative body to be formed. The Grand Sobor was barely worth the name, but it was a start.\n\nThe Vozhd was still the ultimate power in Magadan, as he was not about to give up more than token influence over the nation. In fact, getting Matkovsky to relinquish even what little power that was given to the sobor was almost miraculous in and of itself, but even so a victory had been scored for the people of Russia, as minor as it was.\n\nIt was clear to Petlin that Matkovsky thought the matter closed, that the token reforms he had allowed would be the end of the discussion. He believed he could simply go back to closing his mailed fist ever tighter around the Russian people, but Nikolay knew in his heart that he had only just begun. The Russian people had suffered for so long and they deserve so much more than a council that would rubber-stamp Vozhd Matkovsky 's decrees. It would be difficult, and very dangerous, but he would do all he could to bring about a Russia that its people could be proud of."
 magreg.27.a: "The one step at a time."
 
 magreg.28.t: "By the Will of the Vozhd"
 magreg.28.desc: "In an internal communication sent this morning to senior members of the government, the Vozhd flatly rejected a proposal to establish a legislature, confirming his intention to remain the sole authority - executive or otherwise - within the National Republic.\n\nThe push for a national parliament, led by the so-called 'Reformist' wing of the National Labor party led by Nikolay Petlin, and envisaged as a revival of the Tsarist-era Zemsky Sobor, was one of that faction's primary goals. It is as yet unknown what the effect of this rejection will be, though many within the party expect it to be significant.\n\nThe Reformists are, as expected, enraged by the decision, but even members of the Vozhd's own 'Laborists' have displayed unease. Though they of course support the absolute primacy of the Vozhd, they see division within the party, especially significant division as evidenced in the response to such decisions, as an inherently destabilizing and worrying trend.\n\nMany are predicting the struggle for power between the factions to only grow more intense and, while others make seemingly futile appeals for unity in the face of the Republic's many enemies, foreign and domestic alike.\n\nIndeed, although to the Republic at large the National Labor party is a monolithic one, it is becoming clear that the divisions within it are deeper than ever."
 magreg.28.a: "One nation. One ruler."

 magreg.29.t: "What it Means to be Free"
 magreg.29.desc: ""Welcome back to Radio Free Magadan!" Sergei exclaimed, an ecstatic grin across his face. "I'm sure you must be wondering what I'm so happy about, dear listeners!" A sigh. "Our audience can't see you, Sergei." Vasily's smooth baritone came. "Just get on with it."\n\n"Yes. Yes, of course!" Sergei agreed, as giddy as a child on christmas. "I'm happy, listeners, because the Siberian National Republic has finally agreed to subsidize us, with our content as free as ever. Radio Free Magadan isn't just freer than ever, it's richer!" Sergei cackled with glee, still scarcely able to believe it. A small, rare smile spread across Vasily's face; he could not blame him, with how hard it was to believe. They truly had come far.\n\n"So, let us thank our generous sponsors by starting off the show talking about them. Sergei?" Vasily motioned for his co-host to speak. "Yes! Recently, I've heard some talk that over in America, people are guaranteed the right to assemble. A right to assemble! Can you believe it, Vasily?" Sergei exclaimed. Without waiting for a response, he continued. "I'm starting to wonder why they don't let us do that here. It could be of great benefit. Just look at how powerful the Americans are!"\n\nVasily considered this a moment, nodding slowly. "You know, Sergei, for once you might have a point.""
 magreg.29.a: "Fascism is a fad, radio is forever."

 magreg.30.t: "Free in Name Only"
 magreg.30.desc: "A teenage girl by the name of Galina Alexandrovna, living a relatively comfortable but ordinary life in the town of Magadan, excitedly rushed to sit down at her family's dining room table, where the radio was located in the center and where her parents already sat. It was time for Radio Free Magadan's latest broadcast, and Galina's family had made something of a family event lately of listening to each broadcast after a long day. Not that there was much else to do as a family around town, but still. "Well, what are we waiting for? Turn it on, turn it on!" Galina's father chuckled at her impatience and complied.\n\nHowever, the voice that awaited them was unfamiliar, and as cold as the Siberian weather. "Good day to all tuning in. As you might have already guessed, the old hosts-" Galina could hear the man's contempt for them in his voice. "Are no longer present. They have been taken away for subversive activities, and as such, the Russian Fascist Party will now be operating Radio Free Magadan directly."\n\nAs if to emphasise his point, two gunshots rang out in the background. After pausing a moment, the new host decided to ignore it, but he did not have to comment on it for Galina to know who had been killed. "I will discuss the news in just a moment, but first, join me in pledging allegiance to our righteous Vozhd Matkovsky. Oh Matkovsky, Vozhd of all Russians, bring glory to-" Galina couldn't stand to listen to another word, and shut the radio off. Her parents looked up at her with concern, but made no attempt to turn the radio back on; there was no need. It was simple to figure out what the rest of the show would consist of, now and for the rest of its existence. They, like their daughter, were horrified at the revelation. However, they were but ordinary people; they were no more powerful in this country than ants under a boot. That was to be the future of all ordinary people, it seemed now, just as it had been in the past: to be trampled on by the boots of tyrants forever."
 magreg.30.a: "The Vozhd killed the radio star."
 
 magreg.31.t: "A Brief Glimpse of Daylight"
 magreg.31.desc: "Nikolay Petlin scraped his fork across the plate for about the fifth time since the last bit of meat had been picked clean. Embroiled in thought, he continued to swirl the bits of sauce and grease that remained as his mind wandered. The taint of fascism was running deeper and deeper in Magadan with every passing day, stretching its tendrils across his fair country and tightening its grip. There was an anger there, for sure, but there was also optimism coupled with the tug of despair. It was his duty to rid what was once a protective measure, now a vile curse, from Harbin and Russia at large. Just as he was about to scrape the plate once again, he heard his wife pipe up from across the table.\n\n"It will work out. I have faith in you." Spoke Lydia, already knowing what was tearing at her husband. It haunted her too, in fact. Every facet of Magadan reeked of the RFP and, by extension, her late ex-husband Rodzaevsky.\n\n"Will it? There is so much work to be done, Lydia. Matkovsky rules like a butcher and every day it seems like freedom gets further away and fascism gets stronger." Replied Nikolay.\n\n"Someone has to do it, Nikolay. Gladly, that person is you, but you don't have to do it alone. I know these types, hell I was married to one. They're strongmen. Matkovsky is a man who rules by fear and brutality. A force of freedom will always topple a paper tiger like him."\n\n"Thank you." Nodded Nikolay. The burden was not entirely eased, but at least he had some measure of reassurance. But moreso, he simply wanted out of the conversation. So, with a stiff upper lip he picked up his plate and placed it in the sink before heading off to his study, his mind abuzz with the same witch's brew of emotions."
 magreg.31.a: "A drop of hope still goes a long way, though."

 magreg.32.t: "A New Beginning"
 magreg.32.desc: "For Nikolay Petlin, the last few days had been a whirlwind of confusion and danger. The tyrant Matkovsky was in chains, arrested in a moment of weakness by a man he had thought so below him to be more a bug than a man. Petlin's supporters held the former Vozhd in a secure cell within Magadan, under close guard. It was almost enough to make him laugh, the sheer luck that had been necessary for the success of the coup boggled the mind.\n\nHis co-conspirators had risked it all to overthrow the Tyrant, and had Matkovsky been, ironically, more like his hated rival Rodzaevsky he would have likely ended Petlin's rebellion before it had begun. Thankfully, his arrogance had blinded him to the threat brewing under his nose. Now, a similar trouble brewed even as he sat overlooking the city.\n\nIn the depths of his new office, Petlin found himself in a very precarious position. While Matkovsky was safely behind bars, support for the Tyrant of Magadan was high in the army and the Security Service. It would be a perilous task in and of itself to prevent Matkovsky's supporters from retaking control of the government, but it would be a necessary one. For the people of Russia to prosper, Matkovsky's tyranny needs to be left in the dustbin of history."
 magreg.32.a: "We can finally begin the great work."

 magreg.33.t: "A Lesson Learned"
 magreg.33.desc: "Matkovsky sat in his office, reading documents listing all members of the Reformist wing of the RNLP. He crossed another off the list as a phone call rang in, mentioning another name. One more eliminated. Twenty to go.\n\nHe cursed himself for underestimating Petlin. That backstabber had nearly brought the Vozhd's downfall! Luckily, the fool didn't have enough support for his idiotic coup. Still, it was devasting to Matkovsky to know that someone he trusted, someone he thought of nearly as a friend, would go to all that length just to see Matkovsky fall. Were there more Petlin's waiting in the dark for their chance at power? Were his other advisors planning to take him down? Matkovsky shuddered. He never felt so weak and so undermined. He had to be more cautious. Choosing those who would replace the people he had purged would be a hard job.\n\nStill, this was a lesson to be learned for the future. He would never give away power. No one could be trusted. And most of all, he would never agree to sign off reforms that would weaken his leadership ever again! Only he, the Vozhd, could bring Russia to greatness. Only he could succeed in the crusade against the traitors and the Germans!"
 magreg.33.a: "Long live the Vozhd!"

 magreg.34.t: "A Flight for Freedom"
 magreg.34.desc: "Petlin watched with a small smile from the window of his office as the everyday people of the town of Magadan went about their lives. They were much happier, much more fulfilled now than they used to be, especially when compared to the dark days just after the separation from Rodzaevsky's forces. Those days were long past now, though, and Petlin preferred to think about happier, more current events. One such thing that occupied his mind was his imminent visit to Washington.\n\nIt was amazing that it was actually happening when he thought about it - he hadn't really thought he would be able to do it. Now all that remained was to finish what work he could as hired aides packed his luggage and prepared his papers before he left tomorrow. Petlin could only dream of what finery awaited him in Washington D.C., the great city of democracy. Soon he would not have to dream - he would get to experience it, to enjoy it himself. Once he had, he would get right back to arranging for all other Russians to be able to enjoy that same luxury right here in their own homeland. For now, though, Petlin put those thoughts aside as he stepped away from the window and sat down at his desk to return to his work. Dreams could wait when the work to achieve them could be done."
 magreg.34.a: "Dreams of democracy."
 
 magreg.35.t: "Medals of Dishonor"
 magreg.35.desc: "Yuri Vitvitsky sat on the hill overlooking the bustling port of Magadan, and reflected on how much his life had changed. On the decision he had made, earlier that morning.\n\nHe had, in his older age, decided to fight for Russia, for the idea that his homeland could, one day, be made whole again. But this had not always been the case. He had, in the past, served a very different master indeed. One that he now opposed in every sense of the word.\n\nThe Empire of Japan had once promised much, and he had not had the experience, the knowledge or, he now realized, the desire to see the insidious purpose in everything they did. It had taken him a long time not only to understand that, but also to accept it. To accept how misled he had been. How, in truth, he had not wanted to see.\n\nReaching into his jacket, he withdrew a small container, and opened it to inspect the contents. Medals. The 'rewards' of long and commendable service to an Empire that did not, had not ever, truly had any respect for him. He had been a tool. But no longer.\n\nWith one last thought of confirmation, Yuri drew his arm back and threw the container as hard as he could, watching as it tumbled end-over-end and, finally, struck the water, sinking below the surface. Behind that spot, he could see a large cargo ship moving towards a pier, no doubt carrying materiel for the state's reunification efforts. The contrast, to Yuri, was striking.\n\nHe had a new master. One he could believe in. One who could show his old one the foolishness of their goals."
 magreg.35.a: "There are new medals to be earned."

 magreg.36.t: "To Protect and Serve"
 magreg.36.desc: "Trofim had not, in his wildest dreams, ever thought he would be wearing the uniform of a police officer.\n\nA longtime member of the Russian Fascist Party, he had spent many years escaping from or avoiding capture by the police of various states. As such, when he had first heard that the Blackshirts were being reformed into a police force, he had thought it a joke. He quickly realized that, as was always the case when the Vozhd proclaimed a change, it was no joke.\n\nAt first, he had not liked the change, though he would not have dared to voice that thought. In the Blackshirts, he had been used to doing what was necessary, without much thought to legal regulations. That was no longer the case. And, yet, he found that he did not mind the rules as much as he once had. Because they allowed him to realize something he had always wanted: acceptance.\n\nWhen people passed him on the street now, after the initial period of distrust of course, they no longer regarded him with constant suspicion and fear. After he had worked to capture some low-level criminals, some had even taken to greeting him. He liked that feeling. He liked feeling that, on some level, he was helping people as he helped his country towards its natural destiny.\n\nHe liked that. And he gave thanks to the Vozhd for the opportunity."
 magreg.36.a: "A surprising change of heart."

 magreg.37.t: "Way the Wind Blows"
 magreg.37.desc: "Former Captain of the Pacific Fleet Dimitri Kirlenko was an old man. He had enlisted in the Soviet Navy when he was a young man and had risen through the ranks with the enthusiasm that could not be matched. When he was first made captain he had been given command of the Rykov-class Cruiser Kalinin. He had fallen in love with that ship, she had been his first and his last command.\n\nWhen the Great Patriotic War came to a close and the Presidium fled to Irkutsk, he had served admirably against the IJN in its last offensive. When Admiral Yumashev took the fleet to Kamchatka he had personally ensured the cohesion of his task force. The Fleet's fall to the Father and Magadan had been the last straw for many of his fellow sailors. Those who didn't find work with the new regional hegemon found themselves drifting and drowning their sorrows in booze.\n\nAs Dimitri looked out at the docked merchant ships in the Port of Magadan he thought about his situation. The new rulers of the Far East turned his stomach. He was forced to do things he had regretted in order to keep the Kalinin and her sisters afloat, but even he could not find it in himself to be generous towards members of the Russian Fascist Party. Looking out towards the horizon he contemplated once again whether or not he should leave the country. Perhaps he would take charter passage on a trade ship to America, or go west deeper into the former Union.\n\nHe wondered whether his old friend Admiral Yumashev would approve of the Siberian National Republic and what it stood for. Would he begrudge his decision to abandon his homeland for greener shores? Would he support him staying in this new country? In truth, he knew it didn't matter. It would all come down to his own decision at the end. Dimitri looked out over the waters of his homeland for one more time, taking in the salt air and the sound of the dockworkers. With tears pooling in the corner of his eyes, he walked to the end of the docks. There was a ship there accepting passengers to the United States."
 magreg.37.a: "The final voyage of an old sailor."

 magreg.38.t: "Starting Fresh"
 magreg.38.desc: "A glass was raised at a table in San Francisco, silencing the indistinct voices speaking in Russian, who looked up expectantly. "I propose a toast," The man holding the glass announced. "To America, to the liberation of Russia, and most of all, to the ruination of the Germans!" Glasses clinked together as cheers went out, and as the dinner party continued with renewed energy, Matkovsky thought that his new life here might not be so bad. True, he still thought that the sooner WerBell choked on his own spit and went to hell, the better off the world would be. Nevertheless, he found he was almost coming to enjoy his time in this great American city of San Francisco. It reminded him of Harbin, almost, and filled him with a nostalgia for those simpler days almost enough to drown out his bitterness over his forced exile. Almost.\n\nThe rest of the emigres here were quite agreeable and had helped him to get settled in, and in the years since WerBell's thrice-damned takeover, he had become something of a leader to them, hosting widely popular parties and celebrations for the community. Sadly, not many seemed very convinced of fascism, so whatever hopes he had once had of retaking Magadan and giving WerBell his just reward for betrayal quickly evaporated.\n\nStill, this America was quite a nice land, and the regard in which the emigres held him allowed him to still enjoy some semblance of the power he had once held, so he tried not to dwell on crushed hopes and past adventures. Perhaps, Matkovsky thought, he should write a book, and hope that the next generation or the generation after might finally realize the fascist ideal."

 #Petlin
 petlin.1.t: "The New Republic"
 petlin.1.desc: "Petlin adjusted his glasses as he entered Matkovsky's office, in the old RFP headquarters in Magadan. The place definitely seemed lived in. Shot-glasses with neat whiskey in them, and bottles of vodka just gathering dust littered the desk where the former Vozhd had once sat. Matkovsky likely knew that he was being arrested, and prepared himself accordingly. Petlin just did not expect him to indulge in alcohol, in the twilight hours of his political career. Outside, the wind howled, pounding the window-panes with savage force. Petlin wanted to shiver, but he was not cold.\n\nHe remembered the sight of Matkovsky as the guards hauled him away to prison, awaiting trial. A pair of bloodshot eyes, and a pale face that screamed utter defeat. Once, he had believed that Matkovsky was somewhat of a good man: standing up against the blackshirts and the savage barbarity that was commonplace in Harbin were virtuous deeds. When Petlin proposed the Siberian Bill of Rights, the old Vozhd seemed excited at the prospect of a renewed gesture at political reform. However, right in this office, a few years ago, he remembered as Matkovsky tore at his bill, decrying his ideals as "too liberal." Then came the Dalstroy scandal. Matkovsky was a monster all along.\n\n"No more Harbin," Petlin said, to Matkovsky. "No more the atrocities, no more the ideologies that debase us to the level of beasts." He strode to Matkovsky's favorite gramophone and turned it on. March of Siberian Riflemen filled the air. He picked up an empty shot glass and toasted to comrades long gone."
 petlin.1.a: ""To the memories of Harbin.""

 petlin.2.t: "Hope for Siberia?"
 petlin.2.desc: "Promising reports have reached the CIA from our contacts in the Siberian National Republic. A new government has usurped power from Mikhail Matkovsky's regime, and seems to bear all the signs of a functioning democracy in the making. This new government, headed by one Nikolay Petlin, also seems quite interested in strengthening ties with the US. Requests of that nature from Petlin's government have already reached the State Department, and await our response."
 petlin.2.a: "We could always use new friends."

 petlin.3.t: "Word from Washington"
 petlin.3.desc: "It seems our efforts to strengthen ties with the United States have borne fruit. Our foreign office has received word from American diplomats that they are interested in increasing economic and diplomatic relations between our two nations. All that remains now is to sort out the details, but that shouldn't be too much of a challenge for the Foreign Ministry. This could be the start of a beautiful relationship indeed!"
 petlin.3.a: "Wonderful."

 petlin.4.t: "Exorcising the Shadow"
 petlin.4.desc: ""This is ridiculous, Petlin!" Alexander Pavlov said to him in his office, "the Voz- Matkovsky might have been a criminal, but to abolish his title is a betrayal to our cause." Pavlov sighed. "Let's walk back on this, Petlin, my friend. We must safeguard the legacy of our predecessors. Matkovsky was a good man, and without him, the party would not have reached Siberia. He was a criminal, yes, but all he did, he did for the glory of his motherland."\n\n"I believe you, Pavlov," Petlin replied, his voice calm. "However, comrade, without Matkovsky the Dalstroy would not exist as an entity. The papers," Petlin was exasperated. "The papers in the Irkutsk Presidium. Remember that? The paper trails he'd burnt to cover his trace. The Soviets might not be our allies but their insight is important. Matkovsky is a criminal, and I will see him tried. No trace of his influence shall remain in this - in my - party. I hope you understand."\n\n"Fine. if you would not recognize his existence, then I will not recognize your government." He pointed at Petlin. "Listen, Petlin. I never liked you much in the old days, but now, there is no reason to hold back. You are not my Vozhd, Nikolay Petlin, and I will make sure the Laborists know that. The SIA, too." He stormed out the door.\n\nPetlin was tempted to call out to him, using the American expression. What was it again?"
 petlin.4.a: ""Don't let the door hit your ass on your way out.""

 petlin.5.t: "Criminals No Longer"
 petlin.5.desc: "The bare feeling of legs without shackles was new to Ivanov. The Dalstroy had put him to work digging railways and pointless public works for his association with the NKVD. He toiled, day and night, under starvation rations, sure that he would collapse at any given moment. His body was weak, and the work certainly did him no favors. Ivanov looked at his shoulders and arms. Boney, without much substance nor muscle. The soup they ladled out, thin and unappetizing, did not provide for much sustenance.\n\nThen, armed guards of the Siberian National Republic strode into the camp, arresting everyone. Some of the wardens ran to the woods, after a gunfight with the army. Ivanov heard that the rogue guards had been detained, awaiting trial, same as with their Vozhd. The act startled him. Justice in the depths of the Russian Far East was not unlikely; it was impossible. Yet, there he was, the soldiers casting off his shackles and delivered him away from that hell.\n\nNow, his only concern was that he needed a job. However, surely, President Petlin and his Prime Minister would take care of that. No more shadows, no more domination by powers that only sought power."
 petlin.5.a: "Only Justice."

 petlin.6.t: "Memories of Harbin"
 petlin.6.desc: "The scene was perhaps familiar. Petlin remembered the evenings and nights in Harbin, as the Russian Fascist Party celebrated its zenith. The swastika, the hooked cross ran through by electrified lights, shone like a Christmas tree in the freezing winds of Harbin winters. Yet, they stood, neither fire nor flames warming their hearts, but through the strength of will alone. Love, too.\n\nLove, the strongest of all emotions. It was love that brought them into Russia again. It was love that made them think of Russia when the Japanese and Chinese ignored and discriminated against them. Yet, it was love that also begat Rodzaevsky's obsession with a pure Russia, that justified the Dalstroy's atrocities. As Petlin and the people of Magadan held the candles in the remembrance of such tragedies and feats of will, they closed their eyes and prayed. A choir song soft hymns to God, of forgiveness and repentance. Petlin closed his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his own past. An organizer, of voices that once spoke of him with warmth and looked out for him. Of Matkovsky, of Rodzaevsky - they were young then, and all so foolish. So, so foolish. When he opened them, the patriarch led the flock through the Lord's prayer. Petlin followed."
 petlin.6.a: ""And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.""

 petlin.7.t: "Goodbyes"
 petlin.7.desc: ""Well, Lydia," Petlin said, at the entrance hall to his house, addressing his wife. "I'm off, and maybe for some time. It's going to be a few days, weeks, I don't know. I promise you that I'll be back soon." He regarded his wife with a broad smile on his face. Petlin was proud of her. A dissident in her own right, a powerful and active woman, freed from the clutches of Rodzaevsky the madman. He shuddered to think of what the deranged Vozhd had done to her, but she did not tell of her days in Harbin much.\n\n"See you, dear." Lydia said as she corrected her husband's tie. "Where are you going again? I have been on Magadan for so long that I don't know much about Russia."\n\n"Novosibirsk. The city of the Sun, as they call it, dear. I know that I will be far from you, but this is necessary. Soon, you will leave Magadan, and we shall go westwards. The state cannot hold a government from such a remote position such as Magadan."\n\n"I liked it here, at least."\n\n"I know. We will return here someday when Russia is whole again. Perhaps we'll even cross the straits, into America. See Los Angeles, San Francisco! Maybe even Vegas."\n\nShe smiled, a twinkle of enthusiasm in her eyes."
 petlin.7.a: ""It's a promise, dear.""

 petlin.8.t: "The Assembly of Novosibirsk"
 petlin.8.desc: "The conference at Novosibirsk took place behind closed doors, within the old halls of the city's local presidium. Whatever media that Russia had, as well as some foreign outlets from America, trailed the proceedings. All deputies of the Russian National Party refused to comment. Petlin hurried away on his car before the reporters could reach him, bodyguards shoving the crowds away from him. Whatever that could be gleaned from the discussions within seemed to speak in favor of reformism, although no one knew its details.\n\nFinally, on one crisp morning, Petlin stepped out on a podium, the rest of the Russian National Party behind him. "People of Russia and Siberia," he began, gathering his strength to address a nation. Or half of it. "I stand before you today, the leader of the Siberian National Republic, its president by the will of arms." He paused. "But that will be no longer. I declare thusly: that political parties are now legal, that the government will now seek approval from its people. We dedicate ourselves to the restoration of a democratic, and republican Russia." All eyes were on him. "That is all."\n\nCheering broke out as he turned his back to face his party. In the middle of cold Siberia was a small spring of warmth. The media did not know of it, but Petlin smiled at their enthusiasm."
 petlin.8.a: "The Siberian thaw has begun."

 petlin.9.t: "The Siberian Constitution"
 petlin.9.desc: "After his declaration at the end of the Assembly of Novosibirsk, Petlin had gathered independents, laborists, and his own wing of the party together to discuss the specifics of a new constitution to replace the old Bill of Rights. In this, Petlin added provisions that defended the rights of free speech, assembly, and the right to organize politically. The laborists grumbled and complained, but they did not have sole power on the party anymore. The independents, at first wary of Petlin, soon warmed up to him. Finally, after years of dictatorial rule, a leader who would listen to their concerns.\n\nStanding in the halls of the Novosibirsk Assembly, Petlin remembered the previous years, standing before Matkovsky as the presented his idea of a Bill of Rights before the Vozhd. "Too liberal." The words came back to him. "I am suspecting that you are a socialist, Petlin." He gave a chuckle. How was he so weak? If the same Vozhd returned to him, clad in his full glory, Petlin would not submit. The peoples of Russia have their rights, and he shall not deny them their entitlement. He swore that no one shall experience what had happened in Harbin, ever again.\n\nA couple of Siberian deputies approached him, hammer-and-sickle pins on their suits. Petlin became weary, but then they invited him to dinner. He smiled. Perhaps the communists are not as bad as they say, after all."
 petlin.9.a: "A new democracy is born."

 petlin.10.t: "Enemy, Mentor, Protégé, President"
 petlin.10.desc: ""Do you visit me just to gloat, Petlin?" Matkovsky shot him a venomous look. "When I am dying, you come to me. Foreign Minister, deputy, protégé, but above all, a traitor to our ideals. A traitor to Harbin!" Matkovsky rose from his bed but collapsed right back into it. When Petlin moved to help him, he held his hand out. "I do not need a traitor's help." He coughed blood. "I am close to dying, and I see my vision for Russia burning before my eyes. Its arsonist stands before me, yet I can do nothing."\n\n"Matkovsky," the name sounded strange on Petlin's tongue. "Would those that stand for the memories of Harbin let the pressure heaved upon us against our own people? If a decent man sees the Dalstroy and condemns it not, would it make him true to the memories of labor in Harbin, where women sold themselves on the streets, out of desperation? Tell me that," he held his breath. "Vozhd of all Russians."\n\n"You have no right to address me as such! You lowly worm, lowest of the low. To say that I despise you would be an understatement, Petlin."\n\n"The feeling is mutual, Matkovsky." They stared at each other, too angry to continue the conversation. "Trust me with Russia. I will take care of her well."\n\nA light of sympathy burned in Matkovsky's eyes. "Perhaps. Petlin, if you do not succeed. I will torment you in Hell. Remember that. Now, leave me, Mr. President.""
 petlin.10.a: "Mentor and protégé reconciled within one common wish."
 
 petlin.11.t: "Home Again"
 petlin.11.desc: "A stiff wind blew as Vitaly slowly but surely made his way towards the door, shivering and wrapping his arms around himself. He was here. He was really here again. After all that time he had spent wasting away in Dalstroy, all that time spent praying death would come for him just a moment sooner. At long last, he was returning to the only place that still mattered to him.\n\nHome.\n\nIt was strange, really, how it had become such an unfamiliar word to him. So long he had spent not daring to speak about it, only barely chancing to think of it on occasion, as though afraid showing too much attachment might condemn them to the same fate. Them. His family. Oh, God, his family. How much had changed in the time he had been away? Would they recognize him? Did they even remember him?\n\nOne, two, three knocks on the door, then he lowered his hand, anxiously waiting for a response. Even a 'go away' would suffice. He just wanted to know that they were alive. Finally, after a short time that felt like forever, the door swung open. "Hello, what can I do for-" The woman who had opened the door gasped, her eyes going wide, as though she had seen a ghost. She may as well have. Oh, how he had missed his wife. Did Sofia still love him, he wondered, as he still loved her?\n\nPast her, Vitaly could see two teenagers walking up, confused as to the commotion. His son, Valentin, and his daughter, Anna. He locked eyes with the former, the older of the two. The boy's face was an eerie reflection of his own, young against old, curious against cautious, fearless against fearful. Had he looked like that, before? What had before been like? He could not remember.\n\nSo, instead, he smiled and said the only thing he could."
 petlin.11.a: ""I'm home, everyone.""

 petlin.12.t: "The Drive Home"
 petlin.12.desc: "The scenery outside the car was beautiful. The thin patches of snow had given way to the budding green grasses of early spring, the buzzing of the bees hummed along the windowpanes of the car, losing their song in the clang and din of the engines. Petlin almost dozed off, and the route home wasn't even that long. Lydia was waiting there. Finally, for the first time in years, they may have peace. Free from tyrants, from false messiahs, and enemies - a quiet, after years of screaming and chaos.\n\nPeople waved to his car as it passed by. Some spat. The evening cast long shadows over the fences and bales of hay, and the final patches of cold dissolved under the somnolent gaze of the setting sun. Petlin sat back, letting the cushions of his seat absorb his weight. He looked at his watch. Still a few minutes before home is in sight. He closed his eyes and let sleep take him. The car juddered and shook, but after a day of work, it made for no finer bed. Petlin smiled at the thought of the evening. Friends, comrades, and his wife at the hearth, as warmth promises to wash over the cold that had submerged them."
 petlin.12.a: "For this evening, and many more to come."

 petlin.13.t: "Siberian Sports"
 petlin.13.desc: "'...you should also have a look at the Krasnoyarsk hockey team,' Foreign Minister Yuriy Vlasov said, pointing to Krasnoyarsk on a map of Siberia for the businessman in the Magadan hotel room they were sitting in, 'Yes, they are in a very far off location, but they are very tough and hardy nonetheless, and they will make excellent athletes if given the proper training.'\n\nThe businessman in question, Jason Morrison, stared at the map.\n\n'Are you sure it'll be worth it?' he asked after a long pause.\n\n'Of course! With American money in the team's coffers, they'll have the coaches and equipment they need to be stars on the international trade! Starostin, am I missing anything else?' Vlasov replied.\n\nMorrison looked at Starostin.\n\n'The city of Krasnoyarsk has fallen on hard times, and the sports team is no exception,' the economic minister said, 'If you invest, even to something as ephemeral as sports, it'll go a long way to getting the city back on track to being one of the greatest industrial cities in Siberia.'\n\nAnother pause followed as Morrison considered the city's value, and the team.\n\n'We'll start at a hundred grand a month. If the team shows signs of improving after three, I'll increase it to two.'\n\nThe room muttered in agreement as the two ministers parted the room together. It was important for a new nation like Siberia to get as many powerful allies as it could. While sports may seem trivial, that businessmen were willing to invest in a field like this was a sign that much closer ties to the US would be made in the coming months."
 petlin.13.a: "And, perhaps, the citizens may benefit from such bonds as well."

 petlin.14.t: "The Old Admiral"
 petlin.14.desc: "Ivan Stepanovich Yumashev walked through the streets of Petropavlovsk in the early hours of the morning. The former admiral observed the people as they went about their business. Men and women on their way to factories and shops, parents and children hurried about to grocers to fill their pantries, and some simply sat on benches and observed the passing of the day. A smile broke out on his face when he saw a young soldier guide a scared child back to her parents.\n\nEvery once in a while a former sailor of the Pacific Fleet would approach him and they would talk of life since the dark days in Kamchatka. The younger would boast of pregnant wives and new children and the elders of grandchildren and the relatively easy lives they live now. The Admiral always took time to speak with these men, to hear their problems and their triumphs. When his men needed help, he would do his best to give it and when all they needed was an ear to listen he was all too happy to do so.\n\nIvan eventually found his usual haunt. A small bench under the shade of a great old pine tree facing out into the waters of the Pacific. As he sat, he thought back to the old days. The days after the end of the Great Patriotic War, as the Pacific Fleet slowly but surely came together in Petropavlovsk. He remembered the hard times when the fleet, once the pride of the Union in the East, were forced to prey on shipping lanes in order to survive.\n\nHe thought back to the Divine Mandate's fall to the Fascists of the National Republic, the very same republic he now lived in. It was a strange time for the fleet, as the fascists were soon ousted from within by the current President. Now, as he gazed out at the waters of the Pacific he could not help but think how lucky they had been. Disaster had been averted when Petlin and his supporters ousted the Vozhd and restored the rights of the people. It was strange to think of the origins of this state, but he would say that it was a worthy one. A state he had come to truly feel at home in."
 petlin.14.a: "A home for the lost."

 #Matkovsky
 matkovsky.1.t: "A New, Winter Dawn"
 matkovsky.1.desc: "Matkovsky had been here before, in the misty days where Magadan constituted his only territory. His office was cleaner, his vodka more expensive, and the stationary both more reliable and better to grip. Yet, the old Harbin feeling never left him. He looked at the window, seeing petals of snow unfurl and split in mid-air, the howling of the winter winds dying against the glass-panes. Some flakes stuck, but they slid down, leaving a trail of clear liquid behind them.\n\nHe turned his attention to the list. Sheets upon sheets of names, blotted out in the order of their execution. At the top of the list was his enemy: Nikolai Petlin. The name was crossed out, but in truth, Matkovsky did not know where he went. Still, it was preferable to keep his absence in a more permanent state. Nikolai Petlin was dead, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAides came and went by his room, carrying a chill with them, shivering as they handed out reports of the purge to the Vozhd. "Hey," Matkovsky said to a lanky, blond aide. "Turn that gramophone on." The roar of music and the howl of the winds masked the gunshots, out in the Siberian wilds."
 matkovsky.1.a: "A Vozhd's work never ceases."
 
 matkovsky.2.t: "A Siberian Bill, Renewed"
 matkovsky.2.desc: "Once upon a time, the Vozhd of the Russians entrusted his loyal follower to write a constitution for him. The minister in charge was Nikolai Petlin: the traitor, the man responsible for the poisonous current of liberalism that ran in the Vozhd's party. His venom corroded Matkovsky's hold, like venom hissing upon contact with steel. The Vozhd was a merciful man, full of lenience. Yet, he could never let this sort of thing occur ever again. Not the least when he was this close to power.\n\nSo, he would have to be strict. He had entrusted the Russian before with the powers of political liberties and free speech, yet, they betrayed him. Tonight, by himself and a candle-lit room, Matkovsky would bind together a Siberian Bill of Rights. A new one, with none of the flaws of the old. He had to. If the Russian people and dissidents of the party would defy him, he found no better alternative than self-defense.\n\nHe would start by cutting. The former Bill of Rights was too long, too wordy, too ponderous. It spent a lot of its length clarifying useless liberties that could threaten the party's position. Matkovsky did away with them striking provision after provision with slashes from his pen.\n\nWhen morning light spilled from the windows to his desk, he rose, a new Bill in his hand. The Vozhd smiled, his work done."
 matkovsky.2.a: "Never shall the mistake be repeated."
 
 matkovsky.3.t: "Voter Rolls"
 matkovsky.3.desc: "When his village announced the new voting rolls for his district, Aysen was excited. Perhaps the Vozhd of the Russians would not be the leader of Russians alone. Yet, he, with the rest of the Sakha people living there, found their names absent from the board. Aysen's eyes looked over the A section, over and over again, sure that there was a mistake. It was blank as if the local officials had skipped over him.\n\nSo, this day, he came to the offices of the electoral commission, seeking to complain. Aysen was rightfully a citizen of the state, and he would not see his rights violated. Inside the log-built wooden building was a burly man who attended a thin slab of plank for a table. Two guards, armed with rifles and pistols, stood on the opposite corners of the room. A door was at the back, leading further into the innards of the office. Approaching the man, Aysen said, "Sir, I am sorry for interrupting your work, but my name is not on the voting roll."\n\nThe man smirked. "Are you Yakut?" he said. Aysen nodded. "My, my." He barked at the guard in Russian, who went to the backs of the office and summoned a paper form, composed of five to six sheets. "Fill this form and do the test. I will decide if you can vote."\n\nAysen spoke Russian, but not this kind of Russian. Scientific nomenclatures, technical terms, so many things he could not understand. The form was a literacy test, he realized. A way to cheat the Sakha people from their right to vote. Still, he filled the form with every ounce of knowledge in his mind and handed it to the man.\n\nAn affected disappointment. "I am sorry, but you can't. Perhaps once you've studied a bit more, you would be able to do so. However, as it stands, I can see nothing good coming out of you voting." A smile. "No offense." Aysen left the office fuming, but also frustrated."
 matkovsky.3.a: "The Party needs competent voters."

 matkovsky.4.desc: "차트와 그래프가 그려진 종이와 서류 뭉치로 빽빽한 국가정보국의 보고서가 마트콥스키의 책상에 던져졌다. 맨 윗 장엔 '서쪽의 상황' 이라 제목이 달려있었으며 중앙 시베리아에서 서로 충돌하고 있는 군벌과 도적 공화국들에 대한 포괄적인 정보가 담겨있었다. 보즈드는 보고서를 오랫동안 날카롭게 바라보더니, 손을 뻗어 조심스럽게 각 페이지를 휙휙 넘겼다.\n\n그는 종이 한장 한장을 샅샅이 살펴보며 그 얼어붙은 땅 전역에서 싸우고 있는 모든 볼셰비키 도적들과 기회주의 군벌들의 세부사항을 검토했다. 그들은 서쪽의 얼어붙은 평원에서 식량과 자원을 얻기 위해 동물들처럼 서로 충돌하고 있었다. 마침내 보즈드의 눈은 지역 합병과 통합에 대한 다양한 전략적 계획을 상세히 설명하는 페이지에 이르렀고, 그의 눈은 빛나기 시작했다.\n\n그는 히죽히죽 웃으며 그의 나무 책상에 서류뭉치를 다시 던졌다. 그는 다시금 의자에 누워 보고서의 제안을 되새기며 서쪽으로 진격하는 모든 종류의 계획을 떠올렸다."

 matkovsky.6.t: "Fair Elections"
 matkovsky.6.desc: "There were three names on the ballot for the Tomsk-12 constituency. Two were the candidates of the Russian National Labor Party, who had all the support the party could give them. Time in the local radio, campaigning funds, and the posters with their names that stuck on seemingly every window-corner of a Tomsk street. The Peace Preservation Act had mandated strict ideological requirements for political parties, effectively disqualifying any of the Tomsk Salons from running.\n\nThe other candidate was an independent, a former Bastillard. He entered the elections knowing full well that he was at a disadvantage. None of the old Salons could help him. Radios and newspapers refused to give him interviews. He had some discreet money funneled through by his old pals in the Bastillards, but that itself was a dangerous proposition. Should the authorities discover them, he would be charged with fraud and disqualified from the election. So he did what he did in his Bastillard days: standing on street-corners trying to insult people enough to pay attention to him. Some days, he could have a conversation. Others, the police hauled him away, naming him a "public pest."\n\nWhen the votes were tallied at the end of the day, the result was unsurprising. Ninety-five percent voted for the RNLP candidates, the rest going to the independent."

He had spent a fortune to enter the Russian National Labor Party, only to be defeated in the primaries. Alyosha's politics were liberal: he had hoped to join the RNLP with the express purpose of reforming it from within. Now, bereft of money and opportunities, his days went by too slowly but also too quickly, like candles.\n\nIt didn't take too long for the SIA to find Alyosha. He was not a discreet man, and his behavior had attracted attention. Just as he entered a bar to drink his worries away, two men, one thin and tall, one stocky and beefy, tapped him on the shoulder. "Mr. Alyosha?" they said, "Could you please come with us? We are from the party. We need to talk."\n\nAt first, Alyosha was hopeful. Maybe the Vozhd saw potential in him as a politician and had sent these two men to give him a second chance. However, his flights of fancy were brought down by the weight of gravity when he realized that these two men were probably from the SIA.\n\nTaking him to a quiet street corner, they interrogated Alyosha on his faith for the Russian people, before asking him to volunteer in the Dalstroy. His face paled, but he had little choice. "Yes," he said. "Yes.""

 matkovsky.8.desc: ""Phoning-in this morning, we have received firm assurance from Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the Siberian National Republic, that efforts towards the strengthening of their free republic have recently undergone significant improvement. We have insisted in the past that if they want to hear anything from the United States, they too must show their dedication to the rights of men, to which they have appropriately adjusted and committed themselves to.\n\nMatkovsky presented evidence to suggest that the treatment of minority groups has improved from the Russian ruling establishment. Moreover, we are assured that liberties guaranteed in law have been respected by the state and law enforcement across the nation. Indeed, our own few diplomats across the Pacific have given us the thumbs up after being taken on a tour of Siberia by dozens of state officials to see the great potential of the region, not giving us a single tip for anything worthy of criticism in the young republic.\n\nMatkosvky was slow in his replies when we questioned him, but we have faith he will follow through on his promises. Until then, we will continue our diplomatic missions to discover more about the mysterious eastern republic now cozying up to us."

They stood in regimented columns, upright in rows and awaiting Captain Oleg's next command. These were the new recruits and they had been undergoing viscous training in the wilderness of Siberia to acclimatize them to the bitter eastern chill. Training was harsh, and the officers harsher, but such strict order could carve these men into warriors worthy of the Vozhd's command.\n\nResisting the harsh Siberian cold, they stood still as Captain Oleg walked past and examined each recruit. He looked at each one of the men in the eye and studied their posture. His gaze was piercing and intimidating, his very stare disciplining any sense of disloyalty in the young men's hearts. Captain Oleg reached the end of the column, to which he raised his hand for a moment and the recruits lifted their rifles to their side in synchrony. With his back turned to the recruits, the collective clatter of the rifles reminded Captain Oleg of his early days in the military, and he gazed back at the men to notice they were far more skilled than he was. He smiled beneath his bushy mustache and chuckled for a moment, before returning to his cold and unforgiving gaze."

 matkovsky.10.t: "Grim Tidings"
 matkovsky.10.desc: "Matkovsky sat in his office, drinking wine. Finally, after all these years, a vintage worth its legacy. Warm, sweet, it made Matkovsky tipsy and slightly drunk. The gramophone from Harbin sat in the corner of the room, blaring nostalgic songs: patriotic marches, anthems, Tchaikovsky. The sweet tunes and melodies of his youth brought back memories of him as a teenage boy in the Paris of the East. Finally, all that suffering, all that pain, was worth it.\n\nA knocking on the door, a disturbance to the rhythm. His doctor came through the door, lathered in an icy sweat. His glasses seemed to tremble as he walked forward, his eyes averted from Matkovsky's face. "S-sir," he said, stammering, fear apparent in the crashing of his teeth, "I-I bring you bad news."\n\nLeanig back on his grandiose chair, Matkovsky spoke. "What kind of bad news, doctor? Can't you see that the Vozhd is having a good time? Can't it wait? Surely you do not dare risk my wrath."\n\n"N-no, sir. It absolutely cannot." Swallowing, he continued. "I am afraid you are afflicted with cancer, sir."\n\nFor a moment Matkovsky sat still. He could not believe what had traveled through the doctor's lips. Cancer? Him? At the peak of his life, at this very moment? Lies! Lies! He stood up, calmly, wine glass in hand. Matkovsky jerked his arm back and forward again, catapulting the glass into the doctor's suit, splattering him in red. He wanted to shout, to scream, but he had to be calm.\n\n"Guards! Guards! Take this man away from me!" Boots trampled into the room. "Volunteer him for Dalstroy work. Make sure he is thoroughly educated. Understand?" Nods. "Dismissed." They carried the doctor out, and sobbing trailed after their departure."
 matkovsky.10.a: "There is nothing wrong with the Vozhd. Nothing at all."

 matkovsky.11.t: "A Winter Sonata"
 matkovsky.11.desc: "Matkovsky stared at the papers before him. Holding a side of his stomach, he groaned in pain every time he shifted his weight. The doctor wasn't lying after all. Cancer had come to him, throbbing, pulsating within his belly, a tide of pain that scarcely any painkiller could stem. His new doctors had suggested trips to America. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy - or whatever the hogwash it is these days - could help. Not now. A Vozhd of the Russians should rule from Russian soil, and not delegate his tasks to subordinates while he cavorts with foreigners on strange shores.\n\nMatkovsky inclined his head to the window beside his bed. The snow was falling, layering the frigid air in a cloak of white. Grains of it tossed and turned to the wind's whims, and a hollow rasp whistled as it brushed against the palace's walls. He closed his eyes and listened. Far below, in the kitchen, the voices of the maids and servants raised in curious gossip became indistinct whispers punctuated by shrill notes of laughter. Above, the wooden planks of the attic creaked as they moved Matkovsky's old possessions there. The gramophone, personal mementos, and the stack of Russian marching songs, preserved in perfect record.\n\nHe sat up. The pain was intense, and he gritted his teeth. Swinging his feet to the side, he prepared to stand. One hand on the bedpost, he lifted himself, straining against the mass of shock that seemed to emanate from nowhere. Yet, he did not scream. Then, the Vozhd stood in his opulent bedroom, his knees about to give way under the weight of the agony. Matkovsky took a deep breath and started to walk. He could use a drink."
 matkovsky.11.a: "Everything begins again."

Even though they have fought throughout the world before, our soldiers find themselves pushed to their limits, coming out on top despite the lopsided odds in numbers, equipment, and motivation. Luck has blessed WerBell with the most hardened soldiers of this world.\n\nHowever, we are not interested in mere "good." From the ranks of his current soldiers, WerBell shall pick and choose whoever he favors and believes to be the quintessential elite soldier. He shall assemble them to a single unit. Their pay will be higher, and their only occupation the preparation for war. When the time comes, these soldiers will push themselves forward, further than any man can; they will become the Dogs of War."

 MAG_WA_the_world_calls_for_wetwork: "The World Calls for Wetwork"
 MAG_WA_the_world_calls_for_wetwork_desc: "With the establishment of our relative authority over much of the Far East, we have gained a (not-so) Imperial ransom, and the academy of Chita. Despite the availability of the latter's facilities to train our troops from the backwater Russians, we have a shortage of recruits with adequate quality. However, we are soldiers without borders, and it may be time to look to the outside world for help.\n\nUntil recently, our reputation in the global underworld is that of a mere curious object: something of a fad that gives way after a brief time. After the conquest of the south, however, many have taken quite an interest in our work. If we are to, say, put a call outwards to rally the mercenaries into West Alaska, we would receive quite a lot of applications. WerBell will do just that; the influx of new blood into the ranks of West Alaska shall ensure that no division shall go understaffed and without personnel."

 MAG_WA_the_siberian_expedition_desc: "The time for R&R is over. Siberia awaits. The Republic of West Alaska shall not be sated with only four states as its members. With the influx of mercenaries from our previous call, it'd be a waste to have them sit around and do nothing while the money trickles in. West Alaska must expand deeper into Siberia, to the territories west and north. WerBell shall not rest until he has the whole of the Far East in his hands.\n\nFor our expansion plans, we have three avenues that we can pursue. First, the Reds, to the west. It appears that there are conflicts within their ranks as to the rightful successor of the Union, but it matters to us very little. We will crush both of them. To the north, we have the Father and his forces of peasant militia, who are no problem for our elite mercenaries to handle. Whichever we choose, the momentum of West Alaska must not stop."

 MAG_WA_the_reds_desc: "At first glance, the split between remnants of the Soviets in Buryatia and Irkutsk may seem to be a simple, old-world style power struggle. Alas, not everything is so simple. The gist of the situation is that the Buryats, under former NKVD commissar Valery Sablin, have disagreed rather violently with the President of the Presidium, Genrikh Yagoda. Holding some lofty ideas, as young men are often prone to, Sablin claimed a radio tower amid Buryatia and proclaimed his ambitions: to unify Russia and restore the Soviet Union. Yagoda was not pleased by this and declared Sablin and his ilk revisionists.\n\nHowever, their ideological split does not matter to us. The factories of Irkutsk, as well as the broadcast system in Buryatia, are valuable assets to the people of West Alaska. We do not care whether or not Sablin or Yagoda is right; the fact of the matter is, they are sitting on our rightful soil; if they would not leave, we will then evict them."

 MAG_WA_operation_thunderbolt: "작전명 선더볼트"
 MAG_WA_operation_thunderbolt_desc: "The leader of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Genrikh Yagoda, has been an eyesore on our borders for a while. His speeches, broadcast over our territories, has starting to irk the moods of those in the high command, not to mention demoralizing our soldiers of Russian origin. Also, he is sitting on the most populated cities of the Far East, a juicy target for us. If we can dispose of him and claim these cities for our use, we will expand the recruitment pool of our army, as well as the industry to craft our weapons of war.\n\nYagoda will never see it coming. We shall strike hard and fast, disorganizing his forces, like a thunderbolt cutting the sky in half. The NKVD is, unlike the rest of the Far Eastern armies, proper soldiers, not militias: to take them down we will need the element of surprise. Rest assured, we will do what we do best. Yagoda shall forever grace the footnotes of history."

 MAG_WA_rules_of_nature: "자연의 섭리"
 MAG_WA_rules_of_nature_desc: "It seems that the Soviets had quite the idea for a government. They do not have capitalism in Irkutsk. The state manages all things and distributes the wealth accordingly among the populace, certain biases notwithstanding. The NKVD sought to protect this way of living all this time. A system that might have guaranteed equality among all that participate in it, but one that stifles growth and individual merit. WerBell personally could not stand what he sees as the stagnation inherent within this system.\n\nThis must change. We will disband all the institutions of communism in Irkutsk. No more communism; only capitalism. All that reside there will discover a new, better way of life: the American lifestyle. To live, one must work, innovate, and interact with the market. We will go to the outskirts, purging the rest of the NKVD, making sure that they will never return. After all, this is done, the people of Irkutsk shall be grateful to WerBell for freeing them from the shackles of the past."

 MAG_WA_operation_guardian: "작전명 가디언"
 MAG_WA_operation_guardian_desc: "WerBell knows the character of Sablin to his core, even if the latter finds him incomprehensible. Raised in different circumstances, the two men couldn't have been more distinct from one another. WerBell is a mercenary, and Sablin is a dissident NKVD commissar. Where WerBell sees communism as an un-American thing and therefore seeks to destroy it, Sablin sees hope and reform waiting at the end of his long road to power. However, both are bound in the same childish idealism: WerBell for his soldier state, and Sablin for the eventual renewal of his homeland.\n\nHowever, we shall not let out similarities to keep us from proving whose ideals will triumph in the end. Sablin knows as well as we do that the Far East is a do-or-die land. It's either him or us. We must safeguard our ideas against him, and by making the first move, we will gain the upper hand. WerBell respects Sablin, but his own survival is paramount."

At age twenty-three, he has ruled over a land of his own, and his ideas, along with his firm, resolute faith in them have carried him this far. The people of Buryatia loves Sablin and his ideology, willing to die for his dream of a union of the proletariat, hearkening back to the times of Lenin and the old Revolution.\n\nHowever, what he had made was not a nation of soldiers, but dreamers. In the end, their vision of a new and better Union did not pan out as well as they had expected. These young people have no business running a country. We shall throw all the reforms, alongside the institutions they're meant to apply to, straight into the dustbin of history. WerBell will honor Sablin, in his own way, by using his own, callused hands, to craft a system that does not and will not fail."

It seems that with every day that dawns upon the Far East, the mercenaries are making more and more progress.\n\nIt is time to proclaim the foundation and ideas of our new state. A republic, not for the people, not for any ideologies or ideals, but soldiers. For those that nations abandon, for whoever those who have outlived their usefulness: the Soldier's Republic. All warriors from all nationalities will be welcome to call the soil of West Alaska their home. Whoever believes in WerBell's ideals, we shall give guns, uniforms, and a life spent on the battlefield. No longer shall the coatings and appearances of nationalities and ideas divide us."

Founded in the rich gold mines of the region, the security of the town relies on small-time mercenaries that they hire to keep the peace in and the troublemakers out. Unfortunately for the occupants of Aldan, we have decided to make their little cottage ours, and the gold that they house our pay.\n\nWe ought to show to the people of Aldan how mercenary companies are run and operated. We project that we will be meeting very little resistance on our way to defeat the town. However, as is the case with Yakutsk, the primary issue is not that of difficulty, but time. We would need to be quick, before the Reds and the Father can even think of making a move against those gold mines. Once the conquest of Aldan is complete, we will sell their gold through our diamond networks and make some nice money off it."

 MAG_WA_the_faithful_desc: "To our north, a new adversary has appeared. The Father, whose name is Alexander Men, has assembled a motley crew of peasant militias and disillusioned NKVD and fascist soldiers to assist in his cause. He seems to be a Christian Anarchist, who, ironically for one of Orthodox disposition, holds unorthodox ideas of Christianity. From the reports of Firebase Moses, this force is mighty indeed; perhaps the strongest that we may fight in the Far East aside from the Reds in Irkutsk and Buryatia.\n\nThe war against him will no doubt take a toll on our personnel count and time. However, making the first move will perhaps get us the leg up needed to succeed in crushing his forces. Regardless, many within our ranks are feeling antsy with braving such a vast and motivated force. We have seen insurgents all over the world; that is the reason we ought to succeed."

 MAG_WA_the_war_for_hearts_and_minds: "The War for Hearts and Minds"
 MAG_WA_the_war_for_hearts_and_minds_desc: "From the outset, it is clear that the Father relies on the support of the peasants and hunter-gatherer communities concentrated in the northern parts of the Far East. As he travels south, however, many joined him, willing to give their lives for the Kingdom of God as envisioned by Alexander Men. These peasants, although untrained, are numerous. However, by relying on these, Alexander Men has made a crucial mistake: all it needs to shatter his base of support is to win over their hearts and minds.\n\nIt boils down to that, then: a war of propaganda. From our radio stations in Magadan, we shall shout for the liberation of the Far East from the tyranny of that heretic. Our soldiers will perform infiltration raids into enemy territory, distributing rations and food in exchange for information and intelligence. Without his base of support, the Father is nothing; his house of cards shall fall, tumbling into the dark."

 MAG_WA_efficient_supply_chains_desc: "The war against the Father is ongoing. Our soldiers, assembled from the greatest mercenaries the world has ever seen, are faring relatively well, considering their numbers and our circumstances. However, there is a problem. We are fighting in the enemy's favored area. The rough terrain, combined with the harsh weather, makes it difficult for soldiers to resupply amid the chaos of the lines. Not to mention, the lack of infrastructure and roads ensures that no trucks would pass unmolested through the Siberian woods.\n\nWith the amount of punishment that the Father is giving us, we need to secure that a steady supply of ammunitions and guns make it through the frontlines. We will attempt to replicate the enemy's techniques and methods, adapting their system to better suit our way of conducting war. Fast runners, new roads and routes, as well as reassurances up and down the line that supplies are incoming should do the trick. After all, this is not the first rodeo for many of our soldiers."

 MAG_WA_shock_and_awe: "Shock and Awe"
 MAG_WA_shock_and_awe_desc: "The supply lines are secure, and the war over the hearts and minds of the Siberian peoples are well underway. However, there is still a persistent problem: the Father in the north holds an advantage in personnel that we could not quite match. At the portions of the line that we hold, fending off the militias proves to be a doable task. There lies our problem: there are not enough of us to keep the peasants from breaking through sections of the front left unguarded.\n\nIf we let them continue as they please, they will whittle us down to nothing. WerBell has no plan prepared for his loss, however. The answer to his predicament lies in acting in complete contradiction to the enemy's expectations: he shall attack. By making quick, decisive strikes against the weak parts of their lines, we can overwhelm them and isolate their divisions, neutralizing any threats they may have. These peasant rabbles may be many, but cut off from supplies of food, they can do nothing except surrender."

The Father in the north, a rebellious character whose perversions of Orthodox thinking has allowed himself to get this far now lay in our hands, at our complete and utter mercy. WerBell, not understanding what all the riff-raff about religion is all about, now has to deal with disposing of him. He is honest; the Father for him might as well be an alien from another world, come here to preach a strange faith.\n\nThe Romans, however, might hold the secret to that solution. Damnatio memoriae: the Father does not exist and has never existed. We may not have close relations with the Church, but with enough badgering, they should cave and declare that Men is a heretic. We will need to herd the masses away from the ideas of the Father, no matter how worthy they are of realization. Once we defeat him, we will possess the northern parts of Siberia, and one step closer to the completion of West Alaska as a state."

 MAG_WA_the_best_is_yet_to_come_desc: "The armies of West Alaska have triumphed over the Reds in the East and the Father in the North. WerBell admits that he has achieved far, far more than he had initially expected him to. From a lowly mercenary in the payroll of the most quarrelsome bastard in the Far East, he has come to possess the entirety of the east coast of Russia, staring at his mother country from across the Bering Strait. He doesn't doubt that he, a drunkard and an old, disgruntled soldier, could go far, but an entire state under his pocket? Madness. Pure madness.\n\nNow's not the time to be sentimental, however. To the West, Russia is still in chaos, divided between states that vie with one another for their eventual supremacy over Russian soil. There is so much to do. He looks to his home, and then to his domain. There is work to be done. The best is yet to come."

Not even the intelligence experts in Langley and Washington could have predicted the chain of events that had led to WerBell's success in the Far East. Triumphing over all the other traditional powers of the area - the fascists, communists, and the Father in the North - he has arrived at a position to establish a new kind of state. A haven for mercenaries, the rootless citizens of the world rendered useless by the lack of conflicts.\n\nNo longer shall these concerns plague them: for all who lack work, the Republic of West Alaska shall provide. The disenfranchised, the betrayed, or the disillusioned shall again find refuge beneath the light of liberty. Welcome to West Alaska, gentlemen. We have work to do."
 
 MAG_WA_coopting_the_bureaucracy: "Co-Opting the Bureaucracy"
 MAG_WA_coopting_the_bureaucracy_desc: "When WerBell won this land from the tyrants that proclaimed their love of authoritarian ideologies, he discovered that each of these statelets had its bureaucracy. The communists and fascists, through their obsession with order, has left us with a treasure trove of bureaucratic devices with which to manage their nations. It would be a shame to let all of it go to waste, would it not? In a land where the Republic has no allies, it must find some, and, failing that, make some. To survive, one must concede.\n\nThough the fascists, nazis, and the pinko-communist lapdogs are still loyal to their respective ideologies, the President does not expect that the current arrangement would last long. Once we are firm, we can let go of these sympathizers, and usher in our own loyalists."
 
 MAG_WA_enforcing_the_constitution: "Enforcing the Constitution"
 MAG_WA_enforcing_the_constitution_desc: "The Republic of West Alaska would be no country for its citizens if it did not have its constitution. Largely modeled on the American system, it gives rights to both types of the citizenry: the foreign mercenaries and the locals. On these pillars, the Republic establishes itself: for without either, it would suffer a phantom pain - and no prosthetic can replace the limbs comprised of the human masses. Like the left and right hands, it needs to work together to achieve our collective goal.\n\nAs such, a constitution is necessary. With the President's foresight, the nation has drafted one. There is only one way to go: enforcement. The army shall authorize the deployment of military police officers, to break off disputes between mercenary and civilian groups. In addition, WerBell shall give prominent positions to collaborators that have agreed to join our cause."
 
 MAG_WA_hotline_america: "Hotline America"
 MAG_WA_hotline_america_desc: "Although WerBell would like to view his establishment as a strictly independent endeavor, the bigwigs in Washington do not see it that way. Through WerBell's old OSS colleague and friend, John Singlaub, they have established oversight of his government, monitoring his every political move, trying to shake him out. Is he a loyalist, a patriot? Is he a mercenary out for his own gain? None can say at this stage. What is clear, however, is the Republic's dependency on American arms.\n\nInevitably, we require contact with Lady Liberty to spread the light of freedom. Though the government must tolerate her prying eyes, her watch does not confer only discomfort. The soldiers of the Republic require weapons and the factories of the United States can be better used to support its sister Republic across the Bering Strait. We will establish a hotline that connects us directly to the American government - that way, we can always ring them whenever things go south."
 
 MAG_WA_govern_like_a_cincinnatus: "Govern Like a Cincinnatus"
 MAG_WA_govern_like_a_cincinnatus_desc: "As President, many of the local civilians have accused WerBell of dictatorial tendencies, painting him as a Caesar who does not have the best interests of the people in his mind. It is hogwash: WerBell is a descendant of a White Russian officer who fought in the Russian Civil War. He has much in common with the populace and is only here to bring order to his ravaged homeland. Would it not elate and uplift the heart of a patriot to see his home country soar again among the powers of this world?\n\nThat is WerBell's purpose. Though many may condemn his rule as tyrannical, he is not here to dictate - he is here to rule. Whether they like it or not, the Russians of West Alaska are his subjects, and he looks after them. Perhaps, in the distant future, WerBell might step down and allow a worthier Russian to take his place as the President of the Republic."
 
 MAG_WA_rule_like_a_caesar: "Rule Like a Caesar"
 MAG_WA_rule_like_a_caesar_desc: "Through sheer perseverance and luck, WerBell has gained the possession of his homeland from the treacherous fascists and communists that infested the Far East. Many have condemned his reign over the peoples of this stretch of Russia as dictatorial and iron-fisted, expecting democracy to follow in the wake of the American-aided army. It is not to be so. If there is no one to seize power, WerBell reasons, it shall find itself seized - and he cannot allow that risk. Though the plebians may jeer, it is ultimately in their favor that he takes the reins of chaos.\n\nThe Republic shall make no political promises to the local civilians. Let them mock and let them revolt: for those who bear their crosses must carry them in silence. Better to live a day as a lion than to spend eternity as sheep."
 
 MAG_WA_illiberalism_by_necessity: "Illiberalism By Necessity"
 MAG_WA_illiberalism_by_necessity_desc: "Although it is unfortunate, it must be admitted that the situation in Russia does not permit the political freedoms that Americans enjoy. Although WerBell's heart bleeds for Russians, for his cause to triumph, he must rally Russians from all the political classes behind him. He can allow no dissent, no gap in his resolve to save Russia from the destitution within which she now finds herself. It is a pragmatic solution: when WerBell's term as dictator expires, the Republic shall put its utmost effort towards the expansion of this freedom.\n\nHowever, for now, a certain amount of political curtailment is necessary. WerBell's state agencies shall scan through newspapers, radio broadcasts, and media that the Russian people consume to find any sign of displeasure and rebellion. Only through control and restraint can peace find her way into Russia again."
 
 MAG_WA_integrating_the_nkvd: "Integrating the NKVD"
 MAG_WA_integrating_the_nkvd_desc: "When one speaks of the NKVD to the Russian locals, the surest reaction that it will elicit is a groan. Infamous for their authoritarian practices to keep order and conformity towards the communist orthodoxy, they might be a tool through which WerBell and his Republic may halt dissent. The President himself is not a communist - but in these wastes, no one can afford to be dogmatic. An alternative would be using the Russian Fascist thugs. However, if there is anything the local despises more than the NKVD, it is the RFP.\n\nShould WerBell decide to integrate the NKVD, the Republic shall re-train them to be a vital asset of the state. They will be given police ranks and the duty of keeping the rearguard while WerBell's soldiers fight in the frontlines. The NKVD, although it is brutal, is a lesser evil compared to the RFP. WerBell is a mercenary - he is in the business of choosing lesser evils."
 
 MAG_WA_make_use_of_the_blackshirts: "Make Use of the Blackshirts"
 MAG_WA_make_use_of_the_blackshirts_desc: "The Fascist Party, whose leadership was comprised of Russian émigrés from Harbin and elsewhere in Manchuria, was the first enemy that WerBell faced in Russia. Although the fate of Matkovsky remains unknown as of yet, his and Rodzaevsky's party are left without a guiding hand. Languishing in prisons throughout the Far East, these brutal thugs and party functionaries await only a leader to call them into action. To restore order, the Republic might need their help after all. The other choice would be the NKVD - and that decision is another can of worms on its own.\n\nIf the President decides to use the Blackshirts instead of the NKVD, he will give them a unilateral pardon and a stern warning. While he wages war to restore Russia as one again, these men would have the duty of keeping order in domestic affairs. Although fascism is contrary to the ideals of the Republic, one must occasionally choose the lesser evil."
 
 MAG_WA_executive_orders: "Executive Orders"
 MAG_WA_executive_orders_desc: "As a citizen of the United States of America, WerBell does not like the idea of ruling by decree. Throughout generations, American democracy has sustained itself by careful usage of power and precedent. Although WerBell is President of West Alaska, he fears that any decrees that he passes is grounds for a future dictator to abuse the authority that he would give to himself.\n\nHowever, this is no time to be cowardly. If there is no one to seize power, someone eventually will. The people of Russia do not have the American luxury of an easy life that they can take for granted. In a fight for survival, no one can afford to hold back. The people of West Alaska may be unhappy, but this is the only solution. Caesar saved the masses of Rome, not through concern for their liberty, but for their well-being. Disappointed they may be, but live they shall."
 
 MAG_WA_a_velvet_gloved_iron_fist: "A Velvet-Gloved Iron Fist"
 MAG_WA_a_velvet_gloved_iron_fist_desc: "Like any good ruler, WerBell prefers to be loved rather than to be feared. However, sometimes, it may take extreme measures to ensure that order is kept and that his rule is safe from interlopers and usurpers. He wants the peoples of the Far East and Russia to share in his triumphs, to be happy as he is happy, to suffer as he suffers for the nation. Yet, even when one is as benevolent and open-handed as one can, one may not stop the evil intentions that brew in the dank corners of a man's heart.\n\nFear is as legitimate a tool as love. When adoration and adulation have failed, the government must resort to the implementation of deterrence as a policy. Severe punishment for crimes, infiltration of local communities by the ex-NKVD police, everything that can be done, shall be done in the name of order and fear. The government prefers itself loved; if that fails, it has no qualms with using fear."
 
 MAG_WA_the_carrot_and_the_stick: "The Carrot and the Stick"
 MAG_WA_the_carrot_and_the_stick_desc: "In a region with so many ethnic and cultural variations as the Far East, flexibility is key. WerBell's previous decisions have rendered this path open to him. The carrot or the stick: the Far Eastern people are free to follow our directives or to disobey them. If they choose the former, we shall reward them and promote them as their deeds have seen them fit. If they choose the latter, then they shall be liable to punishment within the criminal code.\n\nAbove all, the government shall attempt to distance itself from the civilian population. Using the previously-appointed police forces, we shall enact punishment. The Republic's civilian bodies shall reward those that perform their duties with exceptional skill. Never say that WerBell is an ungrateful man - he rewards those who deserve it and punishes those that have been failing."
 
 MAG_WA_with_us_or_against_us: "With Us or Against Us"
 MAG_WA_with_us_or_against_us_desc: "If one is to be Caesar, we must learn from his mistakes. On the Ides of March, when his enemies stabbed him to death, Caesar considered those around him to be his friends and companions. Though the locals of this lace may tolerate our rule, they can never fully accept a stranger ruling from their midst. They are not our friends - the relationship is strictly professional, and now, we pose the question: are you with us or against us?\n\nWe are not here to serve them, as the government of the United States serves its people. When one's duty is salvation, there can be scarce little left in the way of compromise."
 
 MAG_WA_a_loyal_legislature: "A Functioning Legislature"
 MAG_WA_a_loyal_legislature_desc: "In our previous attempts at establishing a semblance of control over the Far Eastern territories, we have encountered the bureaucracy of this place. Byzantine, made out of patchwork legal territories that could scarcely be called a nation. Although the situation has settled down, there remains a significant discrepancy, especially in regards to fascist and communist standards. The fascist and communist bureaucracy often do not agree on much - one uses the Imperial system, the other uses metric, for example.\n\nAs a solution to this, the Republic shall promulgate new laws that standardize the differences endemic to the bureaucratic system. From this patchwork of standards, we shall fashion the fabric of a new bureaucracy: a smooth, and gliding citizen service that serves its people well."
 
 MAG_WA_assign_regional_commanders: "Assign Regional Commanders"
 MAG_WA_assign_regional_commanders_desc: "We have, for the moment at least, secured West Alaska. But we must now administer it, if we are to ensure that it remains stable and, above all else, productive. To do so, we will divide the state into regions and appoint a commander to each one.\n\nThese commanders will be chosen from the ranks of our best - and most loyal - men. In this way, we will be sure of their commitment to the goals of the state, rather than any of their own."
 
 MAG_WA_representation_through_service: "Representation through Service"
 MAG_WA_representation_through_service_desc: "It is no secret that the average mercenary under the employ of the President has a better life than the majority of the Russian locals. In addition to better standards of living, political and voting rights, they have a steady source of employment that is sure to provide for them. The locals, of either flavor, envy the merc life. The Republic's laws are stiff, and there is not much room for social mobility - a discrepancy that would not have existed in America, where every man is free to be whatever he wants.\n\nPatterning his government on his home country's model, WerBell aims to fix this. He has a solution that will remedy the Republic's personnel shortage, as well as reassuring the restive locals: representation through service. Now, native Russians can sign up for a tour in WerBell's army and be granted more rights as they complete their term of employment. If they can shoot straight, why bar them from progressing their careers?"
 
 MAG_WA_drawing_the_districts: "Drawing the Districts"
 MAG_WA_drawing_the_districts_desc: "Although the Republic may suspend democracy for the time being, it may not remain that way forever. Whether he is a Caesar or Cincinnatus, WerBell must eventually turn to answering the question of the people. Where do they stand in the Republic? Is the Republic a manner of dictatorship where the stated political rights are restricted indefinitely? These questions bubble in the thoughts of the Far Eastern Russians, who saw the unlikeliest of all candidates triumph over the Fascists and Communists.\n\nTo answer their anxieties, the Republic will make some headway to accepting democracy as its form of government. It will enter a preparatory stage - we will draw districts, establish voting booths, and devolve some governmental authorities to the municipalities and cities. We can complete the process, but not now. War stands on our gates, as the Central Siberians triumph over their own conflicts. Victory is greater than freedom."
 
 MAG_WA_a_legal_path_to_collaboration: "A Legal Path to Collaboration"
 MAG_WA_a_legal_path_to_collaboration_desc: "The Republic has loosened its standards regarding service, but the question still stands: what about collaboration? The truth is that the Republic cannot function as a state without the help of collaborators. From its bureaucracy to its police force, the Russians who willingly submitted themselves to WerBell's rule form the backbone and sinew of the newborn nation. Were it not for the help of these people, we would be nowhere. As a consequence, their status in society is a gray area.\n\nOne way to solve this quandary is to legitimize their position. Allowing more Russians into the civil service, as well as passing laws that confirm their legal status in society, would go a long towards soothing the restive ambitions of the Russian collaborators. The mercenaries will not like this, of course - but is the Republic not a state of, by, and for the Russian people?"

Those brave men and women that answered WerBell's call and hailed from across the world to heed his rallying cry, those who have been with him since the beginning. Those who deserve the world, those who hold up their part of the sky - and what can we give them but the adoration they deserve? If it were not for these brave pioneers, the Republic of West Alaska, the shining beacon of liberty amid a wasteland of dictatorships, might have never existed at all.\n\nNow is not the time for doubt. We shall issue more calls, more cries of rallying spirit, to gather those homeless in their home nations and to give them a reason to live, to fight for. The locals and collaborators might not like this - however, as WerBell often says, fuck them. If we are to triumph, we can make no compromises."

So long dominated by the authoritarian ideologies of communism and fascism, the lands where the lights touch shall know the rule by a fair and gentle hand, whose force is firm but whose grip is steady in these troubled times. The United States of Russia, with its sister republic across the Bering Strait, has risen to the duty of salvation of the Russian people. Soon, democracy shall make its way to the people who have not known rule by popular will, and for that, we have one man to thank: Mitchell WerBell III.\n\nIn his presidential palace in Magadan, where he rules by the will of the peoples of the Far East, he drinks a glass of wine, cheerful. To the west lay Central Siberia: a far stronger foe than any of the statelets that he had faced in his progress to power. However, he fears not: come superior force, the motto of the Republic shall echo through time: libertas vos liberabit."

President WerBell knows all too well the value of the free market, and believes that the time has come for it to return to Russia.\n\nInspired by our American partners, we shall institute an open door policy regarding international trade. Foreign businesses will be encouraged to set up shop on our shores, and in the process they will stimulate our young economy and open up thousands of new jobs.

Our men are the kind who are used to making do with what they have, and aren't the type to scoff at a rifle that doesn't have all the fancy bells and whistles most modern armies are used to.

Magadan can become such a port, but it will take investment.\n\nSoon Magadan will be the gateway to Russia, the new Vladivostok. Ships from the USA, Canada, South America, and Australia will find their way to Russian shores to do business with us. Turning a former whaling port into a new center of global trade will not be cheap or easy, but we have never let that stop us before."

Even as we continue to expand our port's capacity, more and more nations around the globe turn their eyes towards us as they see a new opportunity for trade and fortune. Magadan is finally becoming what we always knew it could be: A central hub of Pacific trade.\n\nWe cannot rest on our laurels and content ourselves with what we have accomplished so far. We are trading with the members of the free world around the Pacific but we can extend our reach further if we try. The ports of Europe and Africa beckon to us. From Stockholm to Cape Town there are more potential partners waiting to see what Siberia can offer them. We must show them."

Mere decades ago, the Siberian far east was little more than thousands of kilometers of forest and tundra contested by irrelevant warlords, but it has become so much more. Under WerBell's guidance it has become a land of potential that is no longer untapped.\n\nSiberia's cities are flourishing for the first time in decades, some of them for the first time ever. The nation grows richer by the day as foreign trade streams in and the local mines and factories produce ever greater amounts of raw and finished goods. We are witnessing the beginning of what can only be called an economic miracle. Russia's largest and least populated region is now well on track to becoming its wealthiest."

To our west lies the rest of Russia, ruled by those who would like nothing more than to crush us out of existence. To the south are the Japanese and their puppets, increasingly concerned by our commitment to freedom and close ties with the United States. Within our own borders are countless dissidents and aspiring revolutionaries, each with their own beliefs but all committed to toppling our rule. We cannot allow our guard to slip.\n\nThere are already disagreements on how we should defend ourselves. Some argue for creating an army of loyal Russians ready to fight for their homeland. Others argue we should double down on working with the mercenaries who put us in power and have got us this far. One thing everyone can agree on is that our army must be expanded and improved. We are no longer a warlord state, but a true nation, and our military must reflect that."

Communist and fascist militias have begun to take up arms against us, launching terrorist attacks and striking at our garrisons. If we do not take action soon our army is in danger of being overwhelmed by a type of enemy it is not prepared to fight.\n\nSiberia's landscape is as hostile as it is unique, and in many ways it is the perfect place for small groups of insurgents to hide from a larger foe. To counteract this natural advantage, we must create units specifically dedicated to hunting down and destroying cells of rebels and terrorists. Using techniques that they have learned in guerrilla wars like Indonesia and South Africa, our mercenaries will lead elite teams to track down and eliminate any radicals who try to oppose us."

The region is well known for its industrial power, and the city of Novosibirsk in particular emerged in the inter-war years as a hub of Russian aviation. As the region pulls itself back together and prepares for expansion, we are likely to be the first target, and our meager air fleet is woefully unprepared to defend against the armada we expect they shall be able to field.\n\nThe first step to addressing this is expanding the facilities our pilots can operate from. Currently our largest air bases are what remain from before the collapse of the Soviet Union with a few halfhearted expansions and modernizations thrown in. Some of these facilities have great potential to be combat bases for our new air force, and one in particular, known as Cheryomushki, is a prime candidate to serve as the new headquarters. Lying to the west of Chita, it is far enough from the front lines to be safe, but not so far that our pilots could not reach the fighting on time."

After the collapse of the Soviet Union the waters of the Sea of Okhotsk became a modern hotbed of piracy, and though the worst of the pirates are long gone, a few of the stragglers remain active. To the south lies the Empire of Japan, the strongest naval power in the world and a nation we have a chilly relationship with at best. While we have no delusions of opposing their naval dominance, we must not concede control of the sea to them without a fight.\n\nTo this end, a small, modern, and combat ready navy must be established. Though it will be stuck in port during the winter months and mostly be used for coastal patrols when it can operate, it will still be a powerful symbol of Russia's revival and our commitment to creating a nation strong enough to defend itself."

With the foundation of the United States of Siberia, it seems that she has bequeathed a home for her followers.\n\nThe Western Russians station their troops outside our borders, outnumbering us in equipment, division count, and personnel.

Novosibirsk and Tomsk, anti-theses of each other, were within a stone's throw of each other.

 westalaska.1.t: "자유 마가단 방송 - 64호"
 westalaska.1.desc: "오늘 라디오는 아무 문제 없이 시작했다. 길들여지지 않은 곡조의 애국적인 라디오 노래로 시작하며 계속 타탁거리던 방송이 지금은 매우 부드러운 피아노 소리를 내고 있었다. 클래식이었다. 쇼팽의 녹턴 Op. 9, no. 2. 하얼빈에서 일했던 용병 몇몇이 특히 좋아하는 곡이었다. 음악은 마지막 음이 울릴 때까지 몇 분간 계속되었다. 그리고 부드럽고 세심한 바리톤 목소리가 들렸다. "시베리아 주민 여러분, 좋은 저녁입니다." 러시아어 밑에는 영국 억양이 숨어있었다. "여기는 새 자유 마가단 방송입니다. 파시스트가 몇 년 동안 붙들고 있었지만 최근에 해방되었습니다. 지금 막 들으시는거라면, 전 스티븐입니다. 제 프랑스인 친구들은 로스트비프라고 부르죠." 조심스럽게 통제된 웃음 소리. "참 재밌는 애들입니다. 러시아인이시라면 - 용병들은 현지인이라고 부릅니다만 - 스트렐록이라고 부르셔도 됩니다. 간단하지만 효과적이죠."\n\n기침 소리가 났다. "아, 실례합니다." 목소리가 말했다. 마이크에서 멀리 떨어진 소리였지만 여전히 들을 수는 있었다. "방송이 끊겨서 죄송합니다. 이제 우리 후원자 워벨 나으리의," 목소리는 "나으리라는 말은 중요하다고요!"라고 속삭인 뒤 원래 하던 말로 돌아갔다. "나으리의 후원으로, 요청이 있다면 마가단의 우리 사무소로 보내주시면 됩니다. 지금은 구 파시스트당 사무실 바로 옆에 있습니다." 종이 사각거리는 소리. "이제 비치 보이스의 서핑 사파리를 들려드리겠습니다. 지금까지 스트렐록, 혹은 로스트비프였습니다."\n\n부드러운 락 음악이 시작되었다."

 westalaska.2.t: "A Tsar's Ransom"
 westalaska.2.desc: "The former Tsar of All Russias sat on the unadorned, smooth concrete floor of his prison. The garb he was wearing did not resemble what he had worn for years: rough, threadbare, and bearing only a single color. His medals, his lapels, his unearned magnificence, all gone, scattered to the winds like the Whites who had protected him. At least, the guards spoke English, and they would frequently joke with him and bring him the best of the prison rations, which now lay before him. Some soup with beans in it, a few slices of bread, and a glass of water. Not much, but enough.\n\nToday's guard, Jack, had told him to dig into his food - ASAP, as he phrased it. An honored guest was coming, Jack said, and he did not want to piss off this guy. Mikhail had known who his visitor was from the start. Dressed in prison uniform and fed like the lowest worker in the world, in Mikhail's veins still flowed imperial blood. It didn't use to be like this. He had no claim to anyone's throne, and his crown did not fit him. All this, for a piece of poorly cooked steak.\n\nThe bars of his prison clanked open. In the gap stood Mitchell WerBell, and an interpreter. Mikhail stood, first a little unsteadily, and after a few seconds, staggered to meet who might be his executioner or his savior. "I can speak English," Mikhail began, "The interpreter is unnecessary."\n\nWerBell nodded his head at his aide, who immediately went away. "So," WerBell said, sizing Mikhail up and down, "A Russian Tsar with a limey English accent? Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed." He took Mikhail by the shoulder, and the two of them sat down together on the Tsar's humble bed, next to his latrine.\n\n"I-I am not Englis-" Mikhail said, before stopping. Interrupting WerBell might not be wise.\n\n"Mr. Romanov," WerBell gestured at Mikhail, "That your name?" Mikhail nodded. "You know, I am not really sure why you're here, and I can let you go for, of course, a small cost. I hear your dad has them deep pockets for royalty. It should be nothing for you."\n\n"H-how much?"\n\n"For a small cost of half-million dollars, I will put you on a skipper headed for England, Australia, wherever."\n\n"I don't have that kind of money!"\n\n"Then you sure as shit should hope your father has." Mikhail was silent. Then, he slowly nodded. "I am glad we had reached an understanding." WerBell left, and the prison clanged shut once more."

 westalaska.3.t: "Reports from Moses"
 westalaska.3.desc: "Nancy Wake was not unaccustomed to the conduct of espionage. She sat in her new office, formerly owned by the RFP member Nikolay Petlin, whereabouts unknown, receiving reports and issuing orders. Her duty was that of a spider - to construct webs of informants, local contacts, and spies: in the hopes of snaring a valuable piece of intel, or perhaps even a snitch or two. Her mind is tuned to the changes in the web, just like how a spider can feel any snag, any object that caught itself in its structure. This morning, her mind polished in the bitter wash of coffee, she had received a report from Firebase Moses: and it did not disappoint her. Cocooned in a file before her, was what she had wanted all along: juicy, valuable intel.\n\nShe could feel the venom emanate from this particular document, however. Firebase Moses had seen activities in the north, although it hadn't coalesced into anything concrete. All reports of civilian movement seemed inconclusive - tracking the cursory, sub-sensory flow of people to the barren north was pointless, not to mention exhausting and taxing. Opening the file, she rustled through its contents: hastily written notes, blurry photographs, and a word that echoed over and over: the Father, the Father. She leaned back in her chair and considered her options. The newly-installed telephone sat across from her. If she lifted the receiver, then the equivalent in WerBell's office would also ring.\n\nWithout a doubt, she reached for it."

 westalaska.4.t: "Answering the Call"
 westalaska.4.desc: "Smith looked over the pitiful port of Magadan, a few planks for rotten wood jutting out to the cold, brackish waters of the North Pacific. On the other side of that ocean is heaven on earth: the United States of America. Land of freedom and liberty, of countless land and infinite money. Smith, from his days and nights in the city of Bloemfontein, had seen America from the covers of magazines, and the brief, barely-legible photographs of monochrome newspapers. War was a business, and business was good, yes; but he did not want to shoot at natives forever. No: he had dreams beyond, to settle in America, and finally end a roaming, sedentary life.\n\nAs images of kitschy glitz fluttered in his mind - of paperback romance books, of the descriptions of one shining city after another, he saw the ship bearing new arrivals to WerBell's latest scheme. No doubt, its occupants held the same kind of dreams that Smith had: to settle down somewhere quiet, somewhere where they could enjoy the winnings of a life spent on betting against fate and coming on top, again and again.\n\nSmith would rather be in the frontlines right about now, where the days passed quickly. An assignment is still an assignment, however, and at least there was pay. He had to watch over the soldiers, and guide them to their new quarters, guide them through the modest town, and generally help them acclimate. He went over his own words in his mind: the greetings, the jokes, and how he would handle and juggle especially inflated egos.\n\nHe lit a cigarette and took a drag. He'd play it by ear, fuck it. His future problems were for his future self. For now, he enjoyed the small luxury afforded to him and made a joke to his past, something only he would ever know. He laughed and watched as the vessel ambled its way through the waves, coming ever closer by the minute."

 westalaska.5.t: "성조기"
 westalaska.5.desc: ""Do you come from America, boy?" WerBell said, toying with the revolver in his hand. A chopped Smith-Wesson, something for emergencies. For the past hour, he had loaded and unloaded bullets into it, spinning the chamber, and playing with the safety, all from the comfort of his arm. The boy, an aide of age nineteen, tried to dissuade him from doing, in a pussy's parlance, "rash actions." WerBell might be drunk, but he knew what the fuck he was doing.\n\n"N-no, sieur," the boy's French accent bled into everything, staining his words with a tang of wine, bread, and croissant. Or something like that. WerBell was a stream-of-consciousness guy, especially when he was drunk. "Though, I have read stuff in the newspapers and magazines. I think that it's a fair country," the boy looked down, "at least compared to France."\n\nWerBell roared with laughter. The aide looked at him with puzzlement, and then growing offense. Before the young man could say anything, however, WerBell cut him short with a quick chamber-snap of the revolver. "Those magazines don't tell you anything about the full picture," the mercenary clambered down from the heights, "They don't tell you jack shit about America. Land of the free, land of liberty, land of opportunity. You can find damn near everything there, except maybe the fun of merc life." He took a sip of his whiskey, finally putting his gun to its holster, "Save up. Save the fuck up. You're young - twenty-one, right? Maybe there you'll find the girl of your dreams, and settle down in a nice farm somewhere in Texas. Or something like that."\n\nThe aide could do nothing but nod. Drunk WerBell was a font of wisdom and violence, and the boy could do nothing but smile at his ridiculousness, at his extravagance."

 westalaska.6.t: "Red Dusk"
 westalaska.6.desc: "AUTOPSY REPORT\n\nSUBJECT: Genrikh Yagoda, former General Secretary of the Supreme Soviet.\n\nEXAMINER: Dr. Johann "Hacksaw" Braun, German.\n\nCAUSE OF DEATH: Gunshots, friendly fire.\n\nCONTENTS: Subject was found with multiple wounds through the sternum section, allegedly fired from a private recruited from the Russian locals. The perpetrator has been court-martialed and punished according to the Provisional Military Code of West Alaska. It happened after an altercation between Genrikh Yagoda and said recruit. The latter was tired and exhausted after a day of "cleaning up after the mess of the NKVD." Having lived under the regime of Genrikh Yagoda, the private attempted to reason with the dictator and acquire a motive for his "cruel, inhumane" reign in the Far East. Distressed at the loss of his fiefdom to what he termed to be "a bunch of mercenary troublemakers," the former president of the Presidium attempted to leverage his protection under the Code and his higher education against the recruit to justify what he euphemistically called "the excesses of socialism."\n\nThis did not go well. After a brief round of intellectual sparring, which the tired Russian recruit found to be annoying to the highest extreme, he fired at Yagoda, killing him after a few shots from his (now-secured) M1911. As it stands, with all parties satisfied with the outcome, with the Russian punished and Yagoda gone, here are the Examiner's recommendations:\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Immediate burial or cremation."

 westalaska.7.t: "꼬맹이"
 westalaska.7.desc: ""어떻습니까, 사블린씨. 편안하십니까?" 통역가가 사블린 바로 앞에 앉은 고용주 - 이단자 용병 미첼 워벨 3세의 말을 전해줬다. 며칠 전, 서알래스카 정부는 전직 NKVD 정치장교 발레리 사블린에게 사형을 선고했다. 지금 사블린은 이 나라를 지배하는 사실상의 독재자와 같은 자리에 앉아있다. 독재자는 쉴새없이 돌아가는 공장의 굴뚝처럼 시가에서 연기를 뿜어냈다.\n\n"네." 사블린은 말했다. 더할나위 없이 당황한 목소리였다. "제가 왜 여기 있는거죠?" 간수들이 워벨과 만날거라고 말해줬을 때 사블린은 도살장으로 끌려가는 양처럼 될거라고 믿었다. 가차없는 용병이 든 총 앞에 서서 아무런 자비 없이 사냥될 거라고. 그 대신 빛나는 접시와 윤기가 흐르는 스테이크, 은제 식기 앞에 앉게 된 것이다. 식당은 마가단 감옥의 어두운 지하실과 달리 밝았다. 샹들리에가 높이 매달려 있었는데 거기 박힌 구슬들은 작은 별처럼 빛났다.\n\n"우린 그냥 평화롭게 저녁 식사를 하는 것 뿐입니다. 남자 대 남자로 말이죠." 워벨은 말했다. "마지막 작별인사입니다." 웨이터 옷을 입은 용병 하나가 사블린의 잔에 레드 와인을 따라줬다. "시가 필요하십니까, 사블린씨? 피는 방법을 모르실 것 같지만요." 워벨은 사블린을 보며 미소지었다. 악의 없는 모습이었다. 사악한 얼굴은 강철로 된 포장에 싸여 있었다. 정치장교가 자기를 어리둥절함과 역겨움이 섞인 눈으로 보고 있다는 것을 안 워벨은 자기 잔을 사블린의 방향으로 기울였다. "드시죠, NKVD씨. 나쁘지 않은 와인입니다."\n\n"고맙지만 괜찮아요." 사블린이 말했다. "당신의 꾀임을 받아 사회주의의 적이 될 바에 투옥되는 수모를 겪고 싶습니다."\n\n워벨은 다시 웃었다. "누가 당신이 살거라 말했나요, 사블린씨? 당신은 23세로 끝입니다. 좀 즐기며 살라고요." 그는 콜록거렸다. "이건 죽기 전에 먹는 식사에요." 워벨은 포크로 사블린을 가리켰다. "어서요, 드시죠." 그는 자기 몫의 요리를 전혀 건드리지 않는 정치장교를 신경쓰지 않고 와인을 마시며 음식을 먹었다. 사블린은 전과 같이 자신의 운명을 포기한 채 워벨의 곁을 떠났다. 그의 일부는 용병이란 정말로 뭔지 궁금해했다."

 westalaska.8.t: "A Soldier's Consitution"
 westalaska.8.desc: "WerBell leaned forward on his desk, his armchair either too small or too large for him, depending on the moment. In his head pounded the noisiest headache known to man - he shouldn't have drunk anything before today. His grip on his pen was slippery, and his grasp on reality equally as magnificent. Putting his pen down, he cracked his fingers together and stretched, triggering an avalanche pain in his head as the cranks of his shoulder administer their punishment. Every tremor of his head, every twitch of the eye, seemed to shake and break reality around him.\n\nIn front of him was the mother of all documents he had to ever write. He liked to pretend that in his alcohol-induced waking nightmare that the black trails of ink were pearls of wisdom, shining in the dark. The other part of him called it bullshit. The sum of himself, the part that thought the chair was too big, believed the latter. Sometimes one must lie for the truth to shine on - another piece of bullshit.\n\nA doorknock. "Are you done," the voice of the fearful French aide said, "Sir?" WerBell decided against replying. His throat was parched, and whatever sound that emanated from it, no mortal human being can ever withstand. He could do with a glass of warm water, but no, "Constitution first, sir." Damned French and their constitutions; what do they know about running nations? Two Empires, three republics, and a country that was half-sunk into the clutches of the Mediterranean.\n\nHe grumbled, he complained, he shuddered and shivered. Sighing, he admitted that it would probably need to be done sooner or later. He peered down on the great sheet of paper and saw that he only just got unto "Minority Protections." It was going to be a long day."

 westalaska.9.t: "Confessions of a Mercenary"
 westalaska.9.desc: "They let him wear his clerical attire, his black robes, and the crucifix wrapped around his neck. They gave him food - not rotting, bottom-of-the-barrel food, but actual, edible meals. Even after their tribunals sentenced him to death by firing squad, they did not stop the special treatment. The Father, Alexander Men, took everything they gave him with a pinch of salt. Gifts from human beings can never surpass the grace of the Lord. Holding it close to his heart, he accepted that his fate was to suffer in the clutches of soft mercy. He fasted, he refused to wear his attire - preferring instead to wear the threadbare, drab wear of the other prisoners.\n\nToday, however, was different. They forced him, first softly, later almost at gunpoint, to wear his clerical robes. The guards said that their master, the deplorable and reviled mercenary, Mitchell WerBell III, sought to meet him, and confess. The remark alone stunned him, not to mention its repercussions. He was not even sure if WerBell was baptized in the Orthodox rite. His men discussed his Russian descent, but surely not? He debated the question until they brought him before WerBell.\n\n"I have nothing to say to you," Men said, "And I doubt that your intent to confess was ever pure." He resisted the urge to spit before his tribulation, the punishment for his failed trial. The two men stood and stared at one another before WerBell started,\n\n"Come on, Father," WerBell flashed a smirk at the agitated Father, "I am irreligious. I just want to talk. To see how a man of God views my career. Perhaps even," he paused. "A blessing." He continued. "I like to believe that I had been merciful in my youthful pursuit. Industrious, in the art of war, and an enthusiastic practitioner of the Lord's gift resolving conflicts with violence." He thumbed his revolver. "I am an arms dealer, and not just guns either. Men, tanks, artillery guns, the many things that render modern conflict possible." Stepping closer to the Father, "I have committed many sins, Father, and I do not see a way to turn back. Perhaps, with your blessings, I ca-"\n\n"No." Men cut him off.\n\nThe surprise didn't register on WerBell's face. "I thought so." He grinned. "Take him away, we're done.""

 westalaska.10.t: "What the Future Holds"
 westalaska.10.desc: "WerBell and Nancy stepped into the town. A few days ago, enemy insurgents had occupied it, turning the overly-large village into a pitched battleground. Shells dotted the ground, and brick buildings lay there, shattered - their facade now scattered around them. In the distance, a half-sunk Parish overlooked the town, its bells hollow. An artillery strike had struck its tower, and the defenders had to watch as the building sagged and leaned, retreating quickly in fear of further fire. Survivors from both sides staggered through the ruin, seeking medical attention and food. A shrill cry sounded in the distance.\n\n"What a mess," Nancy said, "But I guess you are used to this, seeing as-" she turned to see WerBell puffing a cigar, enjoying his time as if he was walking on his own backyard. "It's nice to see that at least someone is enjoying this trip out in the woods." She glanced at a woman in white who hurried between the medical tents, carrying in her arms medical supplies and tools, as well as alcohol to clean wounds. Local medics. Thank god for them. It was her idea. Their mission had expanded exponentially, and now she was sitting in the front-seat to the most mind-boggling phenomenon in Russia. She sighed. Her stay would be longer than expected, after all.\n\nTaking his cigar out of his mouth, WerBell blew wisps of smoke that wafted about him like a fine mist. "This may not look like it," he said, turning to Nancy, "But we're saving these people. For god's sake," he kicked a mound of dirt in front of him, "They can't even save themselves. Remember Germany?" He smiled. "We'll make soldiers out of them just yet," looking at two listless men who stood in front of the remnants of their house, their face emptied by disbelief, and filled with uncertainty, "We'll give them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."\n\nMaybe coming here was a mistake. Maybe the entirety of the mission was a mistake. "I hope you're right," she said, "I would hate for all this suffering to go into something wrong.""

 westalaska.11.t: "A Mercenary Leadership"
 westalaska.11.desc: "Mitchell WerBell sat behind the old desk, the one that used to belong to the fascist Matkovsky. He was still finding bottles of vodka hidden in the office, even after all these years. WerBell, tired after a long day of administrative work, wanted nothing more than to be out with his boys again fighting communists or whoever else, anything to get out of the gloom. It wasn't as enjoyable being behind the lines, but someone had to do it, and it was him.\n\n"Sir, we have a new report for you."\n\n"Another one!" WerBell replied. "How many of these am I going to get a day?"\n\n"It's very important sir, you need to read it."\n\nSkimming the pages, it was mostly good news, depending on what good news could ever be in the Siberian wastes. Multiple sabotage events foiled, most importantly at the Irkutsk hydro plant. The last pages of the report were the most important, however. They were running out of mercenaries. "Our men are strong and well trained," said the aide. "But the problem is, we've grown so fast that we don't have enough troops to guard our borders or complete anti-partisan missions. We need a solution, and the only ones are to hire more mercenaries or bring Russians into our ranks."\n\nWerBell stared into the pages, trying to get any sort of answer from them. Perhaps he did need some of that vodka."

 westalaska.12.t: "Some Assembly Required"
 westalaska.12.desc: "Mitchell Livingston WerBell III kept his face impassive, but internally burned with fury. He had not known how bad the situation was, and he was sure more than one person had been lying to him all this time. They would pay for that.\n\nHe had just inspected his army. Or, rather and as far as he was concerned, his 'army,' it barely being capable of being called such. The rabble that called themselves soldiers possessed no discipline and little understanding of basic field skills. The arms and other materiel they utilized were not only ancient and non-uniform, but also in terrible condition.\n\nWerBell had not lived so long, or secured his and his confederates' rule over the Far East by being sloppy, undisciplined, ill-equipped, or blind. No, he had secured it by taking charge. By putting in an honest day's toil of hard - and quality - work. Like any American would. Or should. And he would do the same here.\n\nLooking each of the officers he now walked past in the eye, he wondered if they knew what was about to be in store for them. There was going to be a lot of very hard work to bring the wider military into proper shape.\n\nAnd, by God, they were going to do it."

 westalaska.13.t: "Language Barriers"
 westalaska.13.desc: "Otto stared at the group of 10 Russians in front of him, their backs straight, their eyes attentive with a hint of bitter resentment, but their uniforms shabby and ill fitting. Muttering to himself in German, the old mercenary straightened back up and took a puff from his cigarette as he ran through hazy memories of the Russian classes he had taken when he was 15. Apparently, they qualified him to train troops.\n\nIn stilted, broken Russian he began speaking to the trainees: "H-Hello, good morning..." Shit, what was the word for recruit? "Students." The squad stared at him in utter confusion, but said nothing. Only silence reigned in the small field outside the barracks, save for the whistling of the siberian winds. Otto's heart beat faster as he floundered for the right words to give orders. Sweat was already collecting on his brow, beaten by freezing wind and leaving him with that agonizingly anachronistic feeling one gets on a cold, sunny day.\n\nLeaning to the side, one of the soldiers whispered to his mate, "Go figure, the idiots send a kraut who can barely speak Russian to train us to fight so we can pretend to be American." The other recruit chuckled in response. Turning red with embarrassment at mockery he couldn't grasp, Otto tried helplessly to form a sentence that would tell them to shut their damn mouths.\n\n"Quiet your faces! Today we will drill open-grass combat. Er- Open field. Open field combat." Otto dropped his cigarette, stamping it into the ground before shakily reaching for another one. At this point, the soldiers were barely holding back hysterical laughter, their lips puckered and their chins dug into their necks to avoid giggling.\n\n"Christ above. Just uh... just run twenty lap, yes students?" The squad nodded and began running down the small, gravel track they had dug the previous night.\n\nOne recruit shouted, "Okay teacher!" As he set off, snickering at his own joke.\n\nOtto went to sit down, lighting his second cigarette of the day."

He began ecstatically, "You're listening to Radio Free Magadan, your best source for entertainment in these changing times.

I have one such man here in the studio with me now. Say hello to our listeners, Mr. Calistrat."\n\nBroken Russian with a strong Romanian accent could be heard over the static of the radio as the guest began to speak, "Hello, I am called Fernando Calistrat; Very thankful to be welcomed to your country and look forward to serving with you armies.

 westalaska.15.desc: "Roger Faulques felt the creak of the wooden docks as he stepped off the boat, stumbling a bit as he adjusted to being on land. Seagulls cried far above the port city of Magadan, a place far from anywhere he'd ever set foot. As he walked along the docks, shuffling in between crowds of travellers, sailors and dock workers, he felt old wounds ache. The bullet in his foot he caught fighting for his country against the krauts. The scars and bullet wounds from his time roving in Algeria. The bullet in his other foot, his chest, and his shoulder he caught fighting for the krauts or some other sordid power with enough money to convince the old soldier to bleed again in some hellhole in the depths of Africa, for some few Reichsmarks and a lifetime of dull pain. The bullet that never left his right leg after his stint in the Italian Middle East, giving him a painful but difficult to notice limp. A thousand other skirmishes lingered in his memory but left no mark like that of those years in North Africa, Central Africa and the Middle East.\n\nStill, Roger was only slightly less able than he used to be, a fact that impressed his employers and drew him fame and renown. The 'Man of A Thousand Lives' they called him. So, when Roger heard a state in Russia was hiring mercenaries, and saw many people he had fought alongside flee to once again live the daring life of a hired gun, he'd decided to give it a shot.\n\nIt was an odd feeling, walking the streets of Magadan as he searched for a barracks, a hiring office, anywhere he could find a job. It felt less like he was looking for another place to work and more like he was looking for a place to belong. Certainly, his career was storied, but he was for once in a place filled to the brim with men like him. They all had a certain look, a look he found in abundance in a crowd of men ahead of him, circled around some building whose signs he could not make out. It did look like the place for Roger to be, though, so he set forward."

 westalaska.17.desc: "Mitchell Livingston WerBell III shook hands with Gordan Ingram, and knew that he had met a kindred soul.\n\nInvited to set up business in the Far East, Ingram had arrived only a short time before, but had already made quite an impression. The man was a visionary in the field of weapons design, and had shown him a number of proposed firearms he intended to continue development upon.\n\nHe, and WerBell besides, had been most interested in a number of compact, extremely high rate-of-fire submachine guns, almost small enough to be considered, at least ostensibly, as a pistol. The military and clandestine potential of such a weapon was obvious, and WerBell had wholeheartedly agreed to facilitate the concern's administrative needs as much as possible.\n\nWerBell had even proposed some ideas of his own, primarily concerning the potential of such weapons with suppressors of various sizes, which Ingram himself had found quite interesting. They were both sure there would be many more weapon designs to come, which could be leveraged not only for profit, but for the state's operations both domestically and abroad.\n\nYes, WerBell thought, it was yet another victory for capitalism in the Far East. And who could complain about that?"

 westalaska.18.desc: "Alexander Pavlov had been an enforcer for many years. Under Matkovsky, he had been in charge of many of the state's security operations. And now, under WerBell, he was in charge of surveying many of the new training facilities that had been ordered opened, ensuring they were up to standard.\n\nIt was a good job and, of course and most importantly, was an excellent way to enrich oneself at the expense of the officers who were not up to snuff. He was, naturally, careful to moderate his efforts to such a degree as to not cause trouble. Many of his former comrades had not been so fortunate, and he had, indeed, shot several of them to prove his loyalty to the new regime.\n\nHe wondered what Matkovsky would have thought of him working with WerBell so. The man had always been supremely practical, understanding the need for hard choices. The party split and retreat to Magadan had been proof enough of that. He pondered if Matkovsky would have understood his choices.\n\nPavlov quickly put the thought out of his mind. If there was one thing he had learned during his many years in the RFP, it was that one had to be very able and willing to change with the times. He had before, when Matkovsky had split from Rodzaevsky. And he was doing so once again. He did not know how long this new reality was to last, but as long as it did, he would ensure he was part of it. While also, of course, making sure he was ready should it fall. He wondered if he would be the one to deliver the coup to WerBell should that happen.\n\nHe suspected he would easily adapt to that reality as well."

He'd been hiding for a while, he wasn't quite sure how long, after the Supreme Soviet fell to Magadan's dogs. He wasn't an idiot. He could see the writing on the wall - a Communist and an NKVD agent? There wasn't a chance he'd survive here. So, like, some manner of vermin, he had hid. For so long. That is, until he heard boots crunching snow outside of the cabin he had found refuge in.\n\nHow could they have found him? He thought to himself, hearing the steps come closer and closer to the cellar doors. There was definitely more than one person coming, he thought, he was sure of it. Before he knew it, the darkness of the basement was pierced by daylight as the doors were thrown open with a dull creak. Gurgen froze, shutting his eyes tight.\n\n"Gurgen Aseryants?" Spoke a voice from somewhere he could not see. Slowly he opened his eyes, pressing his numb hands into the ground to push himself into a sitting position. "Uh... not quite sure you can hear me, but we have an offer for you."\n\nShivering, Gurgen replied, "Who... who the hell is 'we'?"\n\n"United States of Siberia. We could use men of your particular... peacekeeping, talents."\n\nStill cold, Gurgen raised an eyebrow at the name, but ultimately opted to disregard it's absurdity. Better than freezing to death in a dusty basement, "...Very well. Why me?"\n\n"We've recruited a number of ex-NKVD agents, we could use one more. Besides, your friend here with me, Genrikh Lyushkov, gave you a stellar recommendation."\n\nGurgen sat up, grinning at the name of his old comrade.

"Augh!" He grunted, sitting up and rubbing his quickly blackening eye. He'd seen worse wounds from his days with Matkovsky's blackshirts, but it still hurt like hell. Glancing up, he saw a man, what looked to be an officer of some sort, approaching his cell. Yuri staggered to his feet, expecting to be called to attention only for the man to approach the next cell over.\n\nA hushed conversation proceeded between the stranger and Yuri's neighbor, before the jingling of keys could be heard, followed by the metallic whine of a cell door grinding open. "Good to be back!" Exclaimed a voice which was becoming louder as its origin exited his cell. The uniformed officer led Yuri's prison mate into view as he finally approached his cell - none other than Georgy Shekherev, leader of the Amur Blackshirts. Yuri certainly held mixed feelings toward the revelation; Amur had been his sworn enemy for the longest time, but they both shared a prison under WerBell's republic.\n\n"Prisoner Yuri Vitvitsky." Said the officer, as if reading from a script, "The United States of Siberia has an offer to extend to you."\n\nYuri raised an eyebrow, "And just what is that offer?"\n\n"A full pardon for you and several other blackshirts, in exchange for your service to the States as a peacekeeper."\n\n"Christ, anything that'll get me out of this cell is fine by me."\n\n"Very well." Replied the Officer, plucking another key from the chain on his belt and pressing it into the lock on his cell door, sliding it open with the same distinctive grind.

 westalaska.23.desc: "WerBell found himself pensive, a light up Cuban cigar in his mouth to give him some "inspiration" so to speak. The mercenary turned warlord had been pondering on the state of his little eastern Siberian domain, which turned out to be – quite frankly – a shit show to run. Political instability had been a staple of the region for a little over a decade now, governments ranging from Communist dictatorships to more esoteric ones like Men's religious mandate, and of course one shouldn't forget of Matkdovsky's travesty of a "republic" distorting what little idea the natives had of the concept of democracy.\n\nHow could such an unruly region be governed by its people or by anyone for that matter? Mitchel had no idea. Institutions such as the ones found in the United States of America couldn't be implemented over here, or at least, not in the same format or in the current situation that Western Alaska found itself in. As he puffed out a cloud of smoke, the middle-aged man grimaced as a thought crossed his mind: his dream of a federal government couldn't be conciliated with the reality of the situation he found himself in. Though he abhorred the idea, ruling by decrees would be the solution he'd have to settle for – for now – in order to bring much needed stability.\n\nYet as he started to warm up to his decision, WerBell feared that this show of despotic rule would set a precedent for the rise of a would-be dictator successor in the long run."

It had been a shop once, before the fighting. An errant shell had collapsed it along with the owners. Looters had picked the corpse clean. Now all that remained was a shell with a basement, one that worked perfectly for him and his friends.\n\nWhen Andrei entered, Katya smiled at his arrival. "I was afraid you were going to pussy out," She said, then slapped him on the shoulder.\n\n"And what, miss your great company?" Andrei replied, which got a round of laughs. "Okay, enough bullshitting around. Let's talk business." For the rest of the night, Andrei spoke with the others about the needs of the people. Some of them were just upset about the mercenaries getting to do whatever they wanted. Others wanted to implement some of the reforms from the old Union. But it was nothing radical. It could turn into that easily, but the small group of free thinkers was dedicated to nonviolence for the moment. Not out of an ideological underpinning, but because they believed it would lead to their destruction.\n\nWhich is why Katya had to keep showing up at these meetings. Back at her home, she spoke on the radio to her handler. "No, it's a lot of hot air right now, but that Andrei is a smart one. He might do something either brilliant or stupid, either way it could do damage. I'll keep here for another month or so."

Now the skin on his palm, not protected, was red, blotchy and swollen, not to mention throbbing with pain. Staggering back away from the furnace and nearly tripping over the man behind him, he caught the eye of one of the supervisors that had been assigned to the mill days ago. Wincing through the pain, he watched the supervisor approach him and roughly address him.\n\n"What the hell are you doing?"\n\n"Sir, I-"\n\n"I don't want to hear it.

A black car followed by a motorcade of military trucks rolled through the streets, pulling up right beside the Administrative Offices.\n\nIntrigued, Lada leaned further out her window, gripping the sill and trying to discern who was climbing out of the car. Noone she knew, that's for certain, nor anyone who had ever been seen on a ballot or appointed by the Soviet. No, it was some variety of high ranking military man. She never could get down the specifics of uniforms in the newly forged USS, but the man certainly had the entourage to prove his rank.\n\nShe watched the little ant sized man enter the building along with a few soldiers. After a few minutes, more figures exited the building. Only it wasn't the soldiers, it was the administrative staff of the building. Lada stared at the window with deep concern as most of Yakutsk's government was ordered out of the building, presumably to be replaced by the man in the fancy cap and whatever staff he chose to keep. Worriedly, she stepped away from the window and went to go turn on one of her lamps, the night being quite dark by now.

Really, he had no idea who in their right mind would choose to sign up for this paradox of an army, but here he was standing in line. He had no other options, anyway.\n\nHis father had been getting sicker and sicker and his worthless factory job wouldn't cover the medical bills. Ever since the old man had come back from the war in the west, he'd been getting sicker by the year. Andrei had no idea what had happened; maybe it was the bullet in his thigh, maybe it was the months spent in the mud, but he hadn't been able to pay a doctor to treat him much less diagnose him. He'd been just about ready to call it quits when he heard about the new recruitment program; not only were they promising him rights for when his service concluded, but they extended to his family as well.\n\nSo he told his old boss at the munitions factory to shove it and came here, to stand in line and check a clock every five minutes. Finally, he was stirred from his thoughts by the man in front of him leaving the line. He was at the desk now, where a broad shouldered, man in uniform sat.\n\n"Good morning, friend. I trust you are here to join up?" He said.\n\n"Yes." Replied Andrei, resisting the urge to sardonically ask him why else he would be there.\n\n"Just sign here."

The subject of WerBell's interest however was in the landmark created by his niece, Anna. She created the Versailes of Russia, the Winter Palace. It had been the seat of Kerensky's government for a time, but its place in history was cemented by the Bolsheviks storming it in 1917. Not to mention the scarring memory of its destruction, filmed for all to see in the widely distributed films from the German invasion. That Goebbels sure did know how to film the obliteration of history...\n\nNevermind that, WerBell thought. The construction of his Presidential Palace, built as closely as possible to the Winter Palace which was once in St. Petersburg, was complete. It now lay in the Siberia, a proper land of ice and snow. The only fitting place for a Winter Palace, no?\n\nHe was celebrating the occasion with some French wine, brought all the way here from the Atlantic. Over a dozen bottles had been distributed to his men, who would partake in the celebration of the Palace's completion with him. In spirit, though. WerBell wanted to spend tonight by himself. He thought about his contender to the west, who could enjoy the full bounty of Bukharin's Siberian Plan. As he sipped from his glass and looked around, a smile creased his face. He had united a band of the lost and forsaken to his cause. He had made a new nation, not Russian, but one of his own design. He was the master of war and with his beloved soldiers, would march forward and crush whoever was in his path. Would Caesar hesitate, would Napoleon? Actually, to hell with those losers!

Even with two men carrying the chest, the weight of the valuables within made transporting it a herculean affair. "Come on, Kurt, put your back into it! I feel like I'm doing all the work here!" Kurt's comrade, a large American man, choked out with a strained voice.\n\n"I'm trying, it's just-" Before Kurt could conjure up some kind of explanation for his lackluster performance, he felt the chest begin to wobble. Both men lost their balance, and an object slipped out onto the grand and a shattering could be heard.\n\n"Fuck," The American grumbled under his breath, "I hope the Captain didn't see that. What did we lose?"\n\nKurt looked down to see a shattered picture frame, containing a seemingly recent photograph of an old Cossack sitting next to a balding man wearing the clothes of a royal.

His company had endless growth and already investors back home were raking over the cash to help feed his enterprise. Even more would be lining up to invest after the first year, and the next, and the one after that. Each year ramping up production. And Johnny knew he wasn't the only company coming in.

And now he was paying for it.\n\nAt first he figured he could hire American workers, but his contract stated he needed to use local labor. Next he wanted to set up several camps at once, but the infrastructure wasn't there for it. Hell, it was hard enough getting gas for all the trucks he needed. Production was almost ten times slower here than it was back home. The investors had stopped being interested at all. There was only one recourse for Johnny, to bail out. That was the only way he would be able to save his company without it falling apart. Except...\n\nHe didn't read the fine print. He was bound to provide a certain amount of jobs and give a certain amount of revenue, in taxes, to the United States of Siberia. Not to mention a certain amount of lumber, to help with the rebuilding of so many homes destroyed in the unification of the east. That would be done with Walton lumber.\n\nIt wasn't simply Johnny either. All of the American companies that had come here were trapped for at least a decade, if not more. It had been so simple.

The glowing neon sign that read 'Coca-Cola' in American letters. He was certain the cyrillic sign would come up any day now. It's what it promised. American imports had flooded Magadan, giving it life. New jobs were popping up everywhere. To match demand, he had been promoted at the docks and now directed an entire team of dockworkers to handle the cargo. That had been money in his pocket and food on his table aplenty. It was imaginable when compared to the rule of the fascists only years prior. It was time to celebrate!\n\n"Vladimir!" Dmitri called out in the dusty autoparts hall.

Of course, any theory outside of 'here to break us up' would be wishful thinking, and even the most hopeful of the gathered workers knew that.

His father had been kind to the peasants. He tried to be kind himself. He didn't want to be a bad boss. When you had workers trying to organize, well that was only natural. He had tried to work with them. His kindness had been a liability, it seemed.\n\nOther workers along the ammunition manufacturing industry had been organizing. His workers with the workers of other new industrialists carving out a name with the little capital available to them in this new country. Well - the only reason Savin knew about this was the information from the government. This crazy mercenary experiment had produced competent spies. Being friends with America's intelligence community had to count for something huh?\n\nIt was going to be a general strike in a week, all across the ammunition sector. It would cripple production... but Savin knew about this whole his competition didn't. Because he always offered the government the best contracts, because Savin made the least fuss. If he could make up for the loss in labor quickly, he could corner the market.\n\nHe picked up the phone on his desk not far to his smoldering cigarette, "Hello, Sergei?

"Never expected so much money to be passing through a place like this." He muttered to himself, more than mildly impressed as he reflected on the sight before him.\n\nA cargo freighter was being loaded with crates of diamonds and gold taken from the rich mines of Yakutsk, and carried aboard in large crates by a team of longshoremen. These men were hired by the American company Warner worked for, which also owned the freighter and had paid for the diamonds, doubtless to be brought to some destination in the United States are sold there at high prices.\n\nSuch sights were common in the ports of the Far East, these days.

However, Vladivostok is a Russian city no more. After years of seemingly relentless work on improving its capabilities, it has finally emerged as a significant port along the Pacific, drawing in trade from Shanghai to San Francisco, as entrepreneurs and investors seek to extract the vast untapped resources of Russia in general and the Far East in particular through the safest and warmest large port remaining under the control of Russians themselves, and not the German or Japanese occupiers. It now serves to enrich not only those who control it and those who do business in it, but even those ordinary people who live in and around it. Most importantly, it has led to a greater role for the United States of Siberia on the world stage, giving it real power and influence in its own right in dealings with friend and foe alike."

The US refuses to recognize us as a legitimate state! What's the fucking deal?! I thought we had something going here!"\n\nThe agent sighed. "Look, our deal here was always of a more... clandestine nature. Official recognition was never guaranteed, but either way our partnership does not change. My colleagues are still willing to work with you no matter what the State Department says in public."\n\nThe mercenary grinded his teeth in frustration.

She shivered in her fur coat, a gift from a friend - or is it a former friend? - and her breaths came in gusts of white and gray, as trembling fingers plucked the cigarette from its place.\n\nThe pavement clicked beside her, and she reflexively reached for her holster. Nothing was there, much less a gun. Old habits die hard. She eased up, taking in the full figure of her friend - or is it former friend? He reeked of whisky, although he tried his best to mask the odor beneath a layer of perfume. Strange. She did not recall him doing anything of the sort, not least to someone he disagreed with.

 westalaska.59.desc: "One of the unwritten rules Boss taught in boot was that bitching is a free action. Ten klicks away from civilization and buried in sub-zero snow, now-Private Jack Svoboda had a lot to bitch about: his stomach suffered hunger pangs for want of breakfast, and his legs still ached from yesterday's march. Frost bit into skin like the fatigues weren't there. Half a brain went to keeping his mouth shut; half prayed a witless bastard would enter his scope before sundown.\n\nAnd like his gripes were an invocation, the radio blared alive. "Python," crackled its Russian-tinged static, "Patrol, two at treeline north, 300 yard. I take left. In three."\n\nFucking finally! "Copy Boss," Jack near-shouted as he reoriented his Springfield towards the forest's edge. As promised, two men shuffled out from the trees, their arctic camouflage given away by gunmetal black. Why they were here and what for were fleeting thoughts to the tired, hungry merc. Sooner these yahoos drop dead, sooner he RTBs to a warm meal.\n\nJack swallowed a breath and held, like Młynarz taught. Hands steadied, he peered through the scope. The patrol had stopped: Left's buddy neared a pine and fiddled with his zipper. Trigger squeezed, fine cross inched to the pisser's head, that's right, just painting the snow yellow before a bullet blows his brains out in one-\n\n"Three." Crack. The 30-06 flew and hit snow. Heads swiveled in panic; another crack, more distant, before Left lost his. His buddy had barely covered up before a third knocked him face-first into his own piss.\n\nJust like that, Jack had missed his ration ticket for tonight."

Pitch-black midnight shifts and idle chatter never led anywhere good. Then again... "You're always thinking, Seong. But granted."\n\n"Well..." drawled Seong "Kay" Jung-Hwa on his cot. "doesn't all this sound like the silver screens? Bunch of mercs flock to a land of warlords, take things into their own hands and carve a place to call their own. All you need's John Wayne, Joan Fontaine, a hackneyed romance plot and-" he clapped, "-bam! Blockbuster of the year."\n\nAcross Kay sat Kazimierz "Kaz" Młynarz. Ember and spark glinted off rimmed sunglasses seemingly fused to the support gunner's head. "Like Boss said, Kay: keep Hollywood in Hollywood. Unless we're living in a fever dream of yours, West Alaska is our home now. One by and for those without."\n\n"Boss this, Boss that- bah, say something yourself for a change!" Kay retorted. "And I'm not the one who dresses up like a cowboy and twirls his pistols around. That's Baldie!"\n\nHe pointed at Adam "Shashka" Abramov, who was twirling revolvers on each hand. "Mark of good taste, my Korean friend. It say a lot more about you than me. Chasseur, if you can educate the young virgin on woman's wants?"\n\n"Chasseur" Mirielle whistled twice as the silent sniper fed a round to her scoped MAS-36. Someone was close. Before the conversation fully died, Jack leveled his rifle at rustling bushes where the clearing met trees. Thunder split the air twice, and a body hit snow with a soft, distant thud.\n\nTen more emerged with brandished guns."

 wa_superregional.2.desc: "They were a sorry lot, Vasily knew, but they were all Russia had against the American Monster of the East. Soldiers from Tomsk, anarchists, Siloviks, Rurik loyalists, mutineers, and Red Army vestiges made up their force. They numbered, at most two hundred at the start, but skirmishes with the mercenaries had dwindled their numbers further, and now there perhaps forty of them left. They hugged the treeline, these last warriors of Central Siberia, watching the truck convoy of the so-called United States of Siberia roll through the woods. They were outnumbered by the mercenaries, but a quick strike might earn them much-needed supplies and another day of resistance.\n\nLudmilla, a Silovik, peered through the sights of her rifle, waiting for Vasily's signal. Petr, an anarchist, raised his RPG. Finally, Vasily waved his hand forwards. Ludmilla's rifle cracked, Petr's RPG roared, and a dozen other small-arms weapons discharged on the convoy. A rocket slammed into the side of a truck, the explosion flipping it on its side in a fiery conflagration. A bullet ate brain meat and the driver of the lead truck fell dead, the vehicle careening into a tree. All was chaos and death as mercenaries shouted and sighted targets, partisans rushing down to grab what equipment they could.\n\nVasily scampered over a dead mercenary, rushing to the back of one of the downed trucks. He tore open the tarp, and gave a quiet cheer as he saw the medical crates his movement so desperately needed. He gave a start, whirling as he felt a harsh thump in his ribs. Had someone struck him? Vasily turned, wondering why his vision was swimming. A black man in sunglasses with one of the fancy American rifles fired again, his second shot taking Vasily out at the knees. As his vision faded, Vasily watched as his companions fell, their final raid all for nothing."

That included the big fish for her new agency. When she left the capitol she was an agent with a handler. Now she was a Director for the Department Domestic Conspiracies in the Strategic Service Unit. It felt good, it felt... official. In the van with her was a new recruit on his first mission. Next to him was a CIA instructor, who pretended to not be CIA but a normal American mercenary. In the building across the street was a meeting of students being radicalized by a firebrand. In the building next to them... twenty or so agents ready to strike at a moment's notice. Katya knew better than to trust him.\n\n"Have they said anything important?" Katya asked the recruit. The young man shook his head. Katya let out a sigh. "Seems this isn't working," Katya said, then she waited and added, "Alright. We're going in."\n\nMr. CIA let out a gasp, then said in his clipped Russian, "You can't be doing that. Evidence!" Katya turned to him with a grin, cocking back her M1911. "Our States aren't your States, cowboy." The recruit racked back a German surplus rifle and the three of them bursted inside of the meeting. It was a congregation of some youth agitators who wanted a return to socialism. A picture of Sablin hung at the corner which made Katya almost gag. Couldn't these types find someone else to idolize? At least Lenin had a nice beard. Her intuition to march in was correct. The leader was hoarding stolen guns from the army surplus. It was a win then, to stop this idiot before he got them all these kids killed.\n\n"What are you going to do with them?" Mr. CIA asked once the last were put up. "The leader?" Katya replied, "Ten years for the theft probably. The others we can shame and threaten, split them up. Maybe bug their landlines at home to see if they try anything after." With that, Katya walked off towards her favorite bar. She had finished the job early, hadn't she? Time to relax."

Mr. Nakamura was the representative for the few hundred individuals who identified as Ainu in the state Lev represented. Nakamura shook his head, going into the same speech given a hundred times. Under the Tsar, under the Japanese, and under the Communists each and every time the Ainu were persecuted. Already many had been executed in the forced conversion strategies of their oppressors. And now they were denied a state of their own?\n\nLev sympathized with them. He truly did. He had fought alongside two Ainu mercenaries during the early days of WerBell's grand scheme. Good, fierce men from a hardy culture. Now as a Senator, it was his duty to help them. Unfortunately, there simply wasn't enough Ainu living to justify the creation of their own state.\n\n"Mr. Nakamura, that wasn't the only reason I called you here. You see... Having spoken to the President himself I am confident we can secure for you and your people a privileged minority status. Many other Siberian ethnicities are receiving the same. It helps that for such a small population, the Ainu have contributed quite a few capable soldiers. You understand that soldiers hold quite a powerful sway in our nation, yes?"\n\nLev left the meeting feeling happy, knowing that dozens of conversations were happening as the new states were put into effect. He wasn't sure where this experiment of a country might end up. He wasn't certain of the foreign influence either, for that matter. What he was certain of that he was going to set a precedent, here, in the poorest state of this new federal union.

The sounds of celebration almost drowned out his thoughts, but WerBell was determined to take a second to think about what got him here before drowning in alcohol and women.\n\nThey did it. They actually fucking did it. All of free Russia now laid beneath the eagle's wing, the light of American-style democracy banishing the darkness of the anarchy. Since the declaration of unification, foreign investments increased tenfold. Any corporation worth a damn in the free world has opened its first establishments on Russian soil, bringing half the planets' products to a people who have never even seen a modern radio. The demand for foreign goods was never satiated, and back home business was booming.\n\nSpeaking of business, the United States of Russia was now firmly established as the preeminent exporter of mercenaries worldwide, changing the tide of many a civil war in the name of gold and glory. Those who called it the Mercenary State usually do so as an insult, an attempt to question the legitimacy of the USR's rule, but WerBell accepted that name with pride. Never had a nation like his existed, and never will one again.\n\nOf course, some weren't happy with the result. Fuck 'em. There never was a mercenary who cared about the complaints of liberal pussies back home, and WerBell was no exception. Domestically, however, there were a number of Russians protesting his rule, something he did take more seriously. WerBell wasn't too worried about it, though. He could only imagine the culture shock they were experiencing; in only ten years Russians had gone from taking pot shots at each other with Mosin-Nagants to driving American cars and enjoying American freedom. They'd get used to it, he knew. He'd make Texans of them yet.\n\nAs his train of thought concluded, something caught his eye. Two somethings, to be exact, and some of the biggest ones he'd ever seen. WerBell still didn't speak much Russian, but a wink was worth a thousand words. As she approached him with an experienced stride, the old mercenary indulged in one final thought:"

Just as he began to finally relax, he saw a strangely familiar face that stared right back at him. "You there... don't I know you?" He asked in imperfect English.\n\nThe other man's face similarly lit up in recognition. "Faulques? Roger Faulques? It is you!" He laughed and took one of Faulques's hands in both of his own. "It's me, Tadeusz Kowalski! I served with you back in the Congo! It's great to see that you're still in one piece. How have you been?"\n\n"As good as can be expected, considering everything that's happened." Faulques replied with a small smile at Kowalski's enthusiasm. "And how are you? Last I heard you were trying to put as much distance between yourself and Poland as possible."\n\n"Yes, well." Kowalski shrugged sadly. "I fear that Poland as we both know it might be lost forever. Whatever becomes of it, I won't be able to recognize it anymore. It's the same with you and France, isn't it? You know how it is."\n\n"Yes, well." Faulques sighed hopelessly. "Ever since Himmler carved out his state... no, ever since we lost the world war, really, it's lost whatever it was that once made it my homeland. We're both soldiers without a place to return to, it seems."\n\n"Then we should do what we can to make Russia into a place any soldier, from lands living or dead, can call home." Kowalski said decisively, surprising Faulques. He patted him on the shoulder and turned to walk away. "It was good to see you, Faulques. Don't give up just yet."\n\nFaulques stood there, stunned, as Kowalski walked off into the distance. "A new homeland for people like us...""

 MAG_WA_journalist.1.t: "A New Assignment"
 MAG_WA_journalist.1.desc: "Patrick Sullivan had, in his time at the Washington Post, been given many strange assignments. This one, however, he found to be strangest of all. His editor had just placed the file in front of him, and he could barely believe what he was reading. "Bob, you're a funny guy, I gotta tell you," he chuckled. "But you really didn't have to go to all this effort for a practical joke."\n\n"This isn't a prank, Pat," his editor replied. "Everything in that file seems to be at least half-true."\n\nPatrick looked it over again. "What, you're telling me that some American mercenary went over to Russia and...took over from a gang of Russian fascists? Bob, that's crazy. It sounds like something out of an adventure novel. A bad one."\n\nBob shrugged. "Maybe, maybe not. But there's been interest in it from some of the other papers, and we need to jump on this while we still got the chance. We managed to get you a way to Magadan, you're leaving first thing next week."\n\nPatrick stammered, "Uh, Bob, this sounds -I mean, c'mon Bob, you know Mary's expecting, I can't go on a long assignment like this."\n\n"Look, Patrick, it won't be that hard. You can head back whenever you want. You're one of the only Russian speakers here, we need you on this. OK? We'll make sure Mary is fine until you come back." Patrick thought it over, then nodded. Bob was right, he was one of the few people who could probably do journalism in Russia. And yeah, he could end this whenever he wanted."
 MAG_WA_journalist.1.a: ""Guess I'll see you later, Bob.""

 MAG_WA_journalist.2.t: "Welcome to Russia"
 MAG_WA_journalist.2.desc: "He'd heard stories from refugees and diplomats of postwar Russia; a land of bandits and starving peasants, where a warlord's army was lucky to be using equipment that would have been very familiar to Bukharin's Red Army. What he saw was not that. Men patrolled the streets with modern American, Japanese, even German equipment, with crisp uniforms and decent discipline. The people were still poor as shit, but the sight of so many who enjoyed so much foreign wealth, even if they were relatively few, made Magadan an anomaly.\n\nPatrick Sullivan stepped off the dock and found himself face to face with a tall man in military fatigues, an M14 slung over his shoulder. "I am looking for lodgings," Patrick asked the man in halting Russian; he knew he should have refreshed his skills since college.\n\n"I'm an American, dipshit," the soldier replied in English. "You're clearly not a Russian, but you're clearly not a merc either. So who are you?" Pat scrambled to pull his press badge out of his coat, and presented it to the soldier, who snatched it from him and read it over. He laughed as he handed the badge back. "So you're a journo? You're not the first to come here, but maybe you'll be the last to leave. Hey! Assholes!" he shouted at a group of soldiers playing cards nearby. "Come help the new reporter get his stuff to the hotel!"\n\n"Blow it out your ass, Jensen," one replied in a Scottish accent.\n\n"I'll blow it out yours if you don't get over here right fucking now, MacKenzie." As the soldiers exasperatedly moved to help, he slapped Patrick's back. "Yeah, if you stick around long enough, you'll get your fucking story"

 MAG_WA_journalist.3.t: "The Man Himself"
 MAG_WA_journalist.3.desc: ""So we know how you came here, and we know how you took over from Matkovsky. But what I'm interested in is why are you here?"\n\nWerBell glanced at Sullivan with a smirk. "I already told you why I'm here; there was a job, and I got stiffed. Had to take something as compensation, and the country suited me just fine."\n\n"You could have taken anything else and gone home, though," Sullivan countered. He was slightly worried about the glares WerBell's bodyguards were giving him, though WerBell himself seemed to be amused by Sullivan's questioning, even as he took aim at the next target on the range with his vintage Garand. After firing off a few shots, he turned back to Sullivan. "Did you serve in the war?"\n\n"Yeah. I was in Burma a while, and spent a lot of the war in Australia, in case Japan invaded."\n\n"So you know how to use this," WerBell remarked, extending him the Garand. Sullivan paused, then decided it was better to humor the mercenary. He took the rifle, and caught the clip tossed at him by one of the bodyguards. Loading the rifle, he took aim.\n\nEight shots later, he heard the sweet, familiar ping as the clip ejected. WerBell handed him the spotter scope, which Sullivan glanced through. He'd gotten five shots in the 9 ring, two in the 10, and one in the X. Twenty years on, and he was still decent at this.\n\n"Nice shooting. That feel good?" WerBell asked.\n\n"Yeah. Yeah, it did," Sullivan replied, chuckling. "It felt great!"\n\n"That's why we're here," WerBell said. "All of us, to some degree, are here because we feel just the way you do. And honestly? Considering you feel like that...""
 MAG_WA_journalist.3.a: ""...I'm willing to bet that you're going to stay too.""

 MAG_WA_journalist.4.t: "Adrenaline"
 MAG_WA_journalist.4.desc: "The first concern Patrick Sullivan had was that his pen had run out of ink as he was writing down his notes to be sent back to the Post. The second was the thump of mortar fire that jostled the entire post, quickly followed by his third; the "Hura!" of the Red Army soldiers charging his position. All around him, the mercenaries grabbed their rifles and manned their machine guns, discipline breaking down under the surprise and ferocity of the Red attack. He saw in the corner of his eye a section of trench get overrun, and three Red soldiers rushed to the emplacement where he and one other mercenary remained. Panic overtook him, and he grabbed for the first thing that he could use to defend himself; a hatchet.\n\nThe first soldier entered the emplacement. He seemed older than the others, but still inexperienced; he should have tossed a grenade first. He turned just in time to divert a fatal blow, but the hatchet was wedged firmly into his shoulder. He fell back onto the floor, screaming. The second hesitated for a fateful moment, then tried to shoot Sullivan, rather than use the bayonet. Sullivan grabbed the rifle just as it fired, keeping the shot away from him. He wrestled with the soldier for the Mosin, eventually forcing him against a wall. Pat immediately rammed the bayonet into his stomach.\n\nThe third, probably no older than 16, had been trying to avoid shooting his comrade, and now stood, mouth agape, as he watched his friend die. He began to raise his rifle when the last mercenary fired, scattering brain and bone everywhere.\n\nPatrick turned back to the first soldier, crying from the pain of the hatchet, as he saw a bloody man above him. His eyes widened. "Nyet! Nyet -" he pleaded, before Patrick drove the bayonet into his stomach. He squirmed, before rattling one last time. Patrick stood over the corpse, panting, feeling the adrenaline. He smiled involuntarily."
 MAG_WA_journalist.4.a: "For the first time since Burma, he felt alive."

 MAG_WA_journalist.5.t: "Heaven's Ruins"
 MAG_WA_journalist.5.desc: "The "bar" was what used to be Omolon's church. The mercenaries collected the meager relics of the church for their own use and served imported liquor -or communion wine, in a pinch- to other mercs in the village. It was all indicative of the very... aggressive entrepreneurial spirit he had encountered under WerBell, and even Sullivan, trying to write his story, joined in with the raucous mercenaries. The article could wait, life was short and the alcohol plenty.\n\nThey drank, laughed, told stories, and repeated the cycle until the "bar" was closed and the group was in a circle, either passed-out or soon to be.\n\n"How'd it feel?" Elizabeth "Liz" Thompson, an Australian mercenary, asked him.\n\n"It felt great, honestly," he slurred back. "Like back in Burma. The... simplicity of it all. Knowing what to do in a situation, what the stakes are... there's nothing like that back in the States." He sighed, and took another swig of the whiskey. "Honestly? Some days I dread going back. But I have to, at some point, and I want to eventually."\n\n"I thought you said you could *hic* go back whenever you wanted," MacKenzie interrupted from a stupor.\n\n"Well, yeah. And my wife is back there, and my daughter, and..." he couldn't think of anything else after that. Was that what kept him tethered to home? Mary, and a daughter whose name he could scarcely remember? As he sat there, drunk, Liz falling asleep on his shoulder, he wasn't sure how to feel."
 MAG_WA_journalist.5.a: "He drank again to dispel the thought."

 MAG_WA_journalist.6.t: "Dear Mary"
 MAG_WA_journalist.6.desc: ""Dear Mary..." the first words of the letter hung there alone, as Sullivan sat trying to write something, anything, to his wife. He racked his brain for the words necessary to convey his emotions, a confusing mess in his mind.\n\nWhat was there to say? "Dear Mary, I'm sorry I abandoned you?" Was he sorry? When he was here, with WerBell's army, he felt the best he'd ever felt. He barely thought of his family back in America in the heat of the moment, and only slightly more when he was in Russia at all. "Dear Mary, I'm sorry your husband is a lying, cheating piece of shit?" He looked back at Liz, drinking in the bed, her nakedness covered only by the sheet. The two of them had been doing this for a while, and had celebrated the fall of Tomsk with an extended stay in one of the captured hotels. Liz was older than Mary by a full decade, closer to Patrick's age, and not as attractive conventionally, but she knew battle. When they were together, in the trenches or in bed, he felt a euphoria that Mary had never given him. Did he love his wife? He remembered he had, but did he still?\n\n"You want some?" Liz asked, offering him one of the special sugarcubes they'd brought to celebrate, temporarily interrupting his thoughts.\n\n"Not yet, Liz," he replied, before getting back to the letter. "Dear Mary... Dear Mary..." What could he even say? What would ever make up for the fact he barely remembered his daughter's name -was it Sarah or Barbara? - and had never seen her grow up? What would ever make up for the fact that he had failed as a husband? He drank from the glass of water next to him. Nothing, he knew. He would never be forgiven. He couldn't.\n\nHe grunted, crumpling the letter up and throwing it aside. He'd figure it out later, when his head was clearer. He climbed back into bed with Liz. "I'll take that acid now, please," he said smiling."
 MAG_WA_journalist.6.a: ""Dear Mary, Sorry.""

 MAG_WA_journalist.7.t: "Home"
 MAG_WA_journalist.7.desc: ""Don't you give me that bullshit!" Mary shouted through the call. "Don't you fucking dare! How dare you come back with barely a word? How dare you try and insert yourself back in my life!"\n\n"Mary," Sullivan sighed as he leaned against the payphone wall. "Mary, I'm back now. I'm sorry I wasn't -"\n\n"Sorry? Sorry?! You're sorry for what? Abandoning me? Abandoning Kaitlyn? She's almost ten, Patrick, and you've never even met her!"\n\n"So that's her name..." he thought aloud, before realizing what he'd just said.\n\nA pause at the end of the line, then she laughed in disbelief. "I'm getting a lawyer and taking her with me. Don't look for us. Fuck you, Patrick." Then the dial tone.\n\nPatrick felt anger rush up in him, and only barely stopped himself from smashing the receiver to bits. He stepped outside and sat at the bench, watching the passengers go back and forth at SFO. He'd been like them, once, ten years ago. A family man, working a regular job. He pitied them, and his past self. They'd never know the things he'd done, not as he had. Not even the Pulitzer committee had when they'd mailed him the award. He sighed. He hated it here. The calm, the placidity, the... everything. Ten years on, Russia was still Russia; a land of guns, sweat, and adrenaline. A land none of these people would know.\n\nBut he was home. Didn't he want to be home? No, he realized. Home was Liz and MacKenzie. Home was the trench and the armory, the whiskey and the acid. Home was danger and euphoria. Not here. All he'd had left was Mary and his daughter, and now they were gone. Without them, he felt nothing for the ground he stood on. It was time to go home.\n\nHe went to the desk and told the lady at the desk, "I'd like the earliest ticket for Magadan.""

      MAG_DEC_econ_werbell_2_expand_and_darken_our_support_operations_desc: "Failing to gain recognition from Washington, we'll keep operating in the dark. Working with the hand we've been dealt, we'll construct additional support bases within our zones of control to better sustain our operations. If the world denies us the revenues we were hoping to gain from legal trade, we're simply going to make up the shortfall by supplying the world with the goods that the powers-that-be is denying them. Free trade shall be absolute in the Pacific ocean!"

After all, isn't every mercenary a businessman at heart when you get down to it? It'll also have the benefit of letting us conceal the operations of our §nMagadan Base§! behind the front of one of the world's finest import & export enterprises."

A secondary command FOB is needed, one that will expand our reach deeper into the Pacific. We've determined that our best option at the moment is to establish a proper forward operating base off the coast of Kamchatka. Remote and with a good reach to the south and west by air and sea, it's ideal for our plans going forward."

Since the world has decided to treat us like a bunch of criminals, we might as well turn it into a profit. The Pacific Ocean with its endless expanse is in itself the very essence of the freedom that the men and women in our ranks embody. Flying the black flag of liberty, our speedboats and planes will make sure that anything a man desires shall be within his reach for the right amount of cash. Naturally, thanks to our excellent intelligence services, we should be able to stay at a safe enough distance from CPS and OFN interests to anger someone with the firepower to fight back."

To do this, we'll purchase an offshore facility in the Caribbean well within international waters and turn this into our base of operations through the Atlantic and beyond. This will be the SBG's haven beyond Siberia, our Daughter Base. And with this foothold in the Atlantic, we'll be able to carry out our operations even better than before.
