 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_DESC:0 "미하일 알렉세비치 마트코프스키는 여러 면에서 로자예프스키의 사상과는 대조적인 러시아 파시즘의 형태를 보여줍니다. 로자예프스키가 독단적이고 실용주의적이며 숙련되고 불타는 웅변가라면 그는 협상가이며, 재치와 정치적 수완을 이용하여 정적들을 그의 편으로 장악해나갑니다. 로자예프스키가 블랙셔츠의 반유대주의적 진취성을 칭송할때에, 마트코프스키는 그들의 폭력성을 경멸했습니다. 찰나였지만 둘의 목표는 일치했습니다. 그들의 협력으로 더 많은 러시아 난민들이 파시즘을 매력적으로 보게 되면서 RFP회원수는 최고조에 달했습니다.\n\n그 후 대조국전쟁이 발발했습니다. 독일이 러시아를 상대로 대대적인 말살행동을 벌이면서, 둘 사이의 갈등은 더욱 커져갔습니다. 히틀러의 파괴적인 대량학살의 의도에도 불구하고, 로자예프스키는 마침내 손에 넣을 볼셰비즘으로부터 자유로운 러시아를 꿈꾸며 그를 지지했습니다. 마트코프스키는 그런 환상따윈 가지고있지 않았죠. 독일의 대소전쟁, 그리고 그들의 러시아와 러시아인에 대한 인종적 증오심을 들어냈고, RFP가 어떤 호소력을 얻든, 나치는 어떠한 독립 러시아도 그들의 계획에 포함하고있지 않았습니다. 그러나 마트코프스키의 재치로 그와 그의 도당은 침묵을 지키며 그들의 시간을 벌었고 그를 통해 세력을 키워나갔습니다.\n\n때가 되자,그들은 로자예프스키로부터 마가단시를 점령하고 그의 충성파를 몰아내 공식적으로 당을 분열시켰습니다. 이제 자신의 영토를 차지하고있는 마트코프스키는 모국의 폐멸로부터 러시아를 구하고자합니다. 이 목적을 위한 수단은 일본을 지나 바다를 가로질러 놓여있었습니다 바로 미국이죠. 그러나, 마트코프스키와 같은 노련한 협상가에게조차 외세의 권력을 설득시키기란 어려운 과제지만 불확실함만으로 그를 멈추게할 순 없을것입니다."

 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_MATKOVSKY_70S_DESC:0 "축음기의 웅성거림, 접시에 부딪치는 은식기 소리, 금과 은으로 장식된 방의 반짝임, 미하일 알렉세비치 마트코프스키의 손아귀 안에 있는 세상의 모든 풍요로움입니다. 그러나 그는 하얼빈을 떠올리게 하는 발작처럼 갈비뼈 아래 고통의 격렬함이 모두 서서히 사라지는 것을 느꼈습니다. 죽음에 직면하기 전에는 모든 사람이 부족하게 사는 법 입니다. 러시아의 보즈드도 예외는 아니었죠. 포도주 냄새와 모르핀을 유혹하는 냄새가 그의 경험들을 무디게 하는 것 같았습니다. 하지만 아침이 왔을때, 보즈드는 그의 파멸을 직면하고있습니다. 느리고 고통스런 죽음, 운명의 광대와 기회라는 이름으로 굴려지는 주사위에 의한것입니다.\n\n화학요법, 의학, 약, 알약, 그가 시도한 모든 것은 소용이 없었습니다. 패배의 고비에서 몇 번이고 그를 구해낸 미국 친구들도 어깨를 으쓱거릴 뿐이었습니다. 마트코프스키는 늙었습니다. 이제서야 권력의 정점에 이르른 그 존재는 나락으로 치닿고있었습니다. 아무리 정치적 연줄, 계략, 숙청도 그를 치유할 수 없었습니다. 가엾고 딱한 자로다! 만일 그가 내장을 찢고 이를 끝낼 수 있다면 좋겠지만 이는 불가능합니다. 마트코프스키의 몫은 사는 것이었고, 그는 살 것입니다.\n\n자신의 죽음이 의심의 여지가 없을 때, 남은 것은 반짝거리거나 웅웅거리거나 달가닥거리는 것이 아니라, 유산의 조용한 우세함뿐이지요. 그래서 마트코프스키는 러시아와 독일 영토를 나누는 철조망을 가로질러 서쪽을 바라봅니다. 여기서 그는 역사에 그의 이름을 올릴 것입니다. 전쟁이나 평화를 통해, 보즈드는 더 이상 이를 신경 쓰지 않았습니다. 방법은 둘 뿐이고 목적은 수단을 정당화합니다. 결국, 끝은 가깝고 가까운 곳에 있기 때문이죠."

 POLITICS_NIKOLAY_PETLIN_DESC:0 "러시아 파시스트당의 다른 고위 인사들과 달리 니콜라이 니콜라예비치 페틀린은 이민자가 아닌 하얼빈 출신이었습니다. At first, this difference only seemed to be at surface level. Working as a playwright, composer, and writer in Harbin, Petlin joined the Russian Fascist Party and was noted for his talents as a political organizer. Soon, he became the leader of the Fascist youth organization, before finally landing himself a spot in Konstantin Rodzaevsky's Russian Fascist Supreme Council, a timid man surrounded by the personalities of Matkovsky and Rodzaevsky.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded Russia, Petlin condemned Rodzaevsky's support of the Nazis' invasion, resigning in protest. From then on, he drifted to Matkovsky's wing of the RFP, serving as his personal secretary - an arrangement that survived until Matkovsky's act to separate his wing of the party from Rodzaevsky. Petlin found himself rising again, and the former Vozhd of the Russians appointed him as his deputy when the schism occured. Under Petlin, the RFP pursued an agenda of courting the United States by promising reform, a promise that Matkovsky had subverted again and again.\n\nPetlin was there when the Russian Fascist Party became the Russian National Labor Party. He was there when they conquered Siberia, and paraded through the cities of Tomsk and Novosibirsk. He was there for Matkovsky's resignation and arrest over the crimes of the Dalstroy. This time, Petlin swears, he will be there when democracy returns to Russia, under the leadership of the emigres. His destiny shall be the redemption of Harbin."

 MAG_fascist_splitters:0 "Fascist Splitters"
 MAG_fascist_splitters_desc:0 "Long ago, the Russian Fascist Party was a united organization, free from the civil strife that plagues everything in Russia. However, this unity did not last long. The doctrinal differences that divided its two heads, Konstantin Rodzaevsky and Mikhail Matkovsky, had simmered for years, perhaps for decades. It finally came into a head when Matkovsky seized the port town of Magadan for his own use. He promises a free Russia, an unshackled Russia, a Russia liberated from the chains of suffering and poverty. Only time will tell if his promise holds."
 MAG_gateway_into_russia:0 "Gateway Into Russia"
 MAG_gateway_into_russia_desc:0 "Beyond mere circumstance, the Vozhd had a specific intent when he chose Magadan to launch our struggle. The shores of this icy Pacific port bring many blessings. Smugglers from Kamchatka and Alaska alike carry great boons to be processed in the city every day. The Vozhd's government grows from the hub's riches, and in turn so does our legitimacy."
 MAG_fascist_renewal:0 "Fascist Renewal"
 MAG_fascist_renewal_desc:0 "Having reformed our regime to match our reality while not letting go of our ambitions, as well as having gained support from overseas, it seems that Matkovsky's gambles have paid off. With renewed dedication and equipment, we are more than ready to march across the wastes of Siberia to reunify not just the party, but the entire Motherland."

Long displeased with Rodzaevsky's policies and rhetoric, Matkovsky and his wing of the party has taken control of Magadan and are now molding it to suit their purposes. No longer shall the party struggle in the mud, while the whole of Russia suffers. No more thuggery, no more rhetorics of hatred; Mother Russia calls us to her fold, to rescue her from ruin.\n\nBefore Matkovsky can do his duty for his motherland, however, he must rule alone, without constraint and free of disloyalty. While he trusts his wing of the party, he must crush dissent among the ranks. All those suspected of loyalty to Rodzaevsky shall find themselves purged. With his political hold over Magadan secure, Matkovsky shall do his sacred duty, one that he has steeled himself to do ever since the heady days of Harbin: under his guidance, Russia shall stand again, sole, strong, unrivaled."

German terror bombings, bandit raids, and wars fought by Russians against Russians: on the edges of far eastern Russia, Magadan is remote and sheltered from the troubles that plague the rest of the Motherland. Due to its distance, however, Magadan is not much. Located in the sparsest region of Russia, both in population and resources, there is not much here that is of use for the eventual liberation and reunion of Russia.\n\nMatkovsky will change that. The officials of his party shall travel the streets and outskirts of Magadan, for workers willing to join him in his crusade. They will build roads and telegram poles, small workshops, and manufactories. When the day of liberation dawns upon the dark body of Russia, laid to rest by failures of the Reds and the crimes of the Germans, they shall find themselves richly rewarded by their duty and dedication, for Matkovsky shall let no faith in him go to waste."

In the port town of Magadan itself, the industry that exists is small and not particularly tailored to the production of war materiel. Fortunately, in the Far East, this lack of industry persists everywhere, as the industrial center of Vladivostok, developed in the time of the Reds, is now lost to the Japanese and Manchurians. To put it briefly, all who we fight in the East are on a level playing ground.\n\nNo opportunity passes Matkovsky by, however. From the wastes of Siberia, he shall craft factories, with the express intent of waging war, not small-time conflicts between children. The party shall arm and train the soldiers of Magadan as soldiers, not bandits possessing a higher ideal. Additionally, no citizen sheltering under the wings of the party shall know poverty or lack; let this be an example, a vision of Russia to come."

The port town of Magadan has always relied on outside imports during the time of the accursed Union and Empire to sustain its need for food. Deprived of connections to other regions of the motherland, most of its inhabitants have turned to coastal fishing to make do in the meantime. A secret wish spreads in their hearts, born out of hunger: for a Russia to save them.\n\nThe party, and Matkovsky with it, shall heed their call. The officials will gather volunteers and conscripts to work in the fields of Siberia. The Far East is not fertile, but an effort from an honest Russian will be all it takes to create a miracle. We do not need our storehouses to be filled with food overflowing, just enough to survive the harsh climate of Siberia and feed our people. When Russia rises again, all these will be forgotten, like ashes in the wind."

Unfortunately, these acts have only had limited success so far; as hard as it is for Matkovsky and his political clique, to admit it, time will only tell as to the efficacy of these efforts; for now, we can only wait. In the meantime, there is the matter of the armed forces of the party. Though capable and relatively well-armed, our men are not suited for or used to fighting in the far north.\n\nIt's time to try something else. Matkovsky, a soldier himself in an age long past, shall observe as his generals and officers forge from the soldiers a new army of hardened and experienced men capable of fighting in the tumultuous weather of Siberia. Drills will be a regular occurrence, whether in harsh or clear conditions. Every soldier of Magadan shall be the spearhead of Matkovsky's crusade."

From even before the time of the Empire's rapid expansion eastwards in past centuries, various peoples have dwelled here, enduring the harsh weather and making a living from it. The troops of Magadan have much to learn from them, and their advice on surviving in the wild could mean the difference between life and death in the unrelenting conditions of the Far East.\n\nTo acquire these advisors, some troops, along with local interpreters, will travel north to the lands surrounding Kamchatka. There we will establish contacts with the natives, in hopes of using their millennia of experience to aid the development of our own theory of warfare. We shall mold our soldiers into survivors, into victors! No longer shall they survive in the Siberian wilds by the skin of their teeth: from now on, they shall live with neither doubt nor concern given to the gods of the far eastern lands."

 MAG_radical_techniques_desc:0 "The Far East is a wild, wild land. Sparsely inhabited even during the Union and Empire, without the civilization to sustain the Russian expansion east, life has become challenging and unrelenting. In the forests and tundras of Siberia, war does not assume the character it has further west. With no significant infrastructure to speak of, warfare in the north has been reduced to skirmishes between the little powers that battle for control of the Far East. To come out on top in Siberia would mean abandoning the general precepts of war as it is taught in Europe.\n\nFor the sake of our cause, we must leave behind everything we know. After all, the methods of war change to fit the ages. Our soldiers will receive a radical new training regime, based on the lessons we have learned from the siberian natives. Soon the forests and tundras of Siberia will be like the plains and fields of western Russia to us, with no obstacle to stop us from attacking the enemy, whether it be Rodzaevsky, the Tsarists, or even the Reds."

With enough workers to staff their floors and sufficient machinery, they can begin to operate as intended. From the streets of Magadan, these factories' chimneys can be seen churning out smoke, a hint of the things they create within. Rifles, uniforms, bullets, even artillery guns and shells lurk inside of them. The party has triumphed again in the most desperate of situations, and Matkovsky is pleased.\n\nIt is time to arm the militant wing of the party. With adequate equipment, our soldiers will stand to fight the Reds, the Tsarists, or Rodzaevsky with much greater strength, even if it is a mistake to underestimate them so early. This advantage will afford us the opportunity we need to unify the Far East, as Matkovsky gears up for a crusade to liberate the motherland from the clutches of suffering and disunity."

 MAG_winterized_gear_desc:0 "Among all the ways that the Far East can be inhospitable, the most prominent is its low temperature. To move in the cold Siberian winter is hard, to fight in it is even harder. Worse, the gear that our soldiers currently use often decays or is otherwise useless in the harsh weather. We must find a solution as the winter conditions are a near-constant concern for the troops. Moreover, acquiring more durable equipment for the Siberian winter would give our soldiers another crucial advantage against our enemies.\n\nMatkovsky will order all military equipment to be winterized. As most of our equipment is not ready to be used in low temperatures, this will be a lengthy and involved process. However, this is a struggle we must endure. The eventual liberation of Russia will take everything we have, and this small inconvenience is nothing compared to that challenge; someday, when Matkovsky rules Russia, all of this will prove its worth."

The winterization order is complete; the equipment churned out by our manufactories are now capable of performing in low temperatures. We are ready to act, but winter is coming.\n\nThere is not much we can do against the forces of nature. We must sit the winter out, and station the soldiers to perform maintenance on the telegram poles and roads. Patrols will still happen, to ensure that Matkovsky's domain will remain free of crime and banditry, but no combat exercises will take place. All units will operate as usual, adjusting for weather. When it ends, there is an enormous task that awaits us all, and Matkovsky shall stand ready at the helm."

Our food supplies are running out, our winterized equipment barely works in the winter winds, and our farms and factories are non-functional. The winter might have come and gone, but it has left its mark on our efforts to stabilize the realm and gain traction amid the harsh siberian conditions. Perhaps it is time to look outward, using Matkovsky's plans to reach out to foreign powers and émigrés to support his cause in Russia.\n\nWe have three options that we can go through. The Tsar, residing in Chita, is our unwilling enemy at best, but perhaps we can convince his clique to accept a ceasefire. The Americans, under their president Nixon, may be inclined to support us provided we make them promises of reform. Finally, the Russian émigrés, the most prominent of whom is the influential fascist Anastasy Vonsiatsky, might be persuaded to through their resources behind our cause. Regardless of whom we convince to support us, one thing is clear: the party will not survive alone."

An evolution of the diverse emigré movements and organizations that appeared in Harbin, the regime has based itself not on fascism, but Tsarism. The group of white generals behind Chita's foundation approached Michael Andreevich, a descendant of the Romanovs yet one with little legitimacy as a contender for the throne, and took a part of Yagoda's empire as it collapsed.\n\nWe share a lot in common both in our ideologies and our enemies, and Mikhail seems eager to cooperate and forge a closer relationship for now. It might be difficult due to the lack of an overland connection, but that will not stop us from making contact with our new friends in Chita."

This means that if we are careful and closely examine our pathways and schedules, it is actually possible to create a route or even several of them that will be able to connect us to Chita through secret means. These routes, guarded by our best men, will allow for a flow of weapons and resources that goes both ways, and even the transport of emissaries between our states. If we can smuggle anything we want to and from Chita, that is a good first step in overcoming geography and establishing diplomatic relations."

We share a common background, but while they trace their roots to the old ways of the Tsar's empire, our ideology stems from a new and fresh movement, that of Russian fascism. Of course, it is the faith of the old Russian generals and politicians in the power of a monarch that separates us, but that does not make reconciliation impossible in this dire environment.\n\nTo face the common enemy that is Rodzaevsky's Fascist Party, we will make a move showing our friendship and respect for Chita, by proposing a pact of cooperation and non-aggression with them. If they accept, then we may even have a chance to strike at Amur with more safety."

Now that we have found allies in Chita, we can make a show of force to demonstrate our power and test our capabilities as well.\n\nWe will find the perfect moment to strike, and when we do a raid larger than any other we've launched will begin. The Tsarists shall help distract Rodzaevsky's army in the east, and we will hopefully improve our position in the freezing lands of Eastern Siberia."

Matkovsky has set his eyes on getting at least a small fraction of that might to support his quest to reclaim Russia.\n\nPresident Nixon is the nation's current leader, and so far he has not shown much willingness to involve America in Russian affairs, something we need to change. There are two requirements to gain American support: the first is to prove our regime can be a useful and reliable asset - the second is to show that we are different from the fascists they hate. Achieving both will be crucial if we want overseas aid to arrive."

To portray ourselves in a positive light, perhaps it is time to begin making reforms, or at least appear to be making them, and a good start is a guarantee on the rights of our citizens.\n\nA formal document will be drafted and signed by Mikhail Matkovsky, guaranteeing basic rights such as equal treatment, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly to all people, ethnic Russians or not. Regardless of whether we we follow this law to the letter, it will be a sign that we are eager to reform and we are not the same as the German Nazis, something the USA definitely cares about."

Thus, our leader Matkovsky has devised a plan to make an offer the USA will not refuse.\n\nMagadan is quite close to the Japanese Home Islands, that are just across the Okhotsk Sea, and a radar station here would give our future allies the opportunity to spy on their sworn enemies from a closer distance.

Leading his own political organization of White Russian émigrés, the RFO, he has garnered significant support from Russian refugees currently residing in the United States.\n\nNow that we have split from Rodzaevsky, perhaps Vonsiatsky would reconsider his support for the Russian Fascist Party. Having the backing of the foreign-based RFO would give us a source of income untouched by the bandit raids of Rodzaevsky or the Reds. Along with this new stream of income, there are rumors that he knows one of the most dangerous men in America: a former OSS operative named Mitchell WerBell III.

Since then, he has served in many conflicts the world over, earning him the fearsome nickname "the Wizard of Whispering Death."\n\nMatkovsky has decided that it would be in the party's interest to welcome this character of a man into our ranks. Along with him will come his entourage: a collection of mercenaries who have fought across the world and are now looking to fulfill any need for "wetwork".

The sons and daughters of Russia in America shall no longer find their money squandered by party functionaries for frivolous things: now, they support a real movement.\n\nThe RFO shall channel their money from America and across the Bering Strait, in the form of hard currency or even equipment, whether it be war- or industry-related.

They have proven themselves to be a capable asset to Matkovsky so far, and although their loyalty is only as strong as their pay, they may well be worth the money.\n\nHowever, due to their independent nature, these mercenaries have been functioning outside the command structure, only taking orders from their commanders, and are generally uncooperative except for direct orders from Matkovsky himself. This practice must end. We will integrate the mercenaries into the rank-and-file; having better skills does not mean that one is exempt from subordination to a superior.

From overseas, the support of émigrés has become ours, as Vonsiatsky has deigned to join us in the crusade to liberate our sacred homeland. Our position is firm, secure; it is now time to solidify these advantages as Matkovsky's ideas take root in the Far East.\n\nBefore the party in Magadan proceeds to its holy task, perhaps it is time to stop and let the results of these treaties simmer for a while. Let the funds overseas flow into the coffers of the party, with American support ensuring steady gains.

While the party is no pacifistic organization, its militant wing so far only consists of trainees and militia drawn up from the streets and outskirts of Magadan, given guns that are either crude or non-functional. If the push west is to happen, we need to reform them into a proper professional army.\n\nWe have several options for how we can approach this. The first is to adhere to a doctrine suited for a local force; after all, Russians know how to best fight on Russian soil. The second is to request American advisors, whose experience in the proxy wars of the world could win Russia as well.

They are adamant that only Russian tactics and strategy can win in Russian soil, a view that Matkovsky personally shares but has yet to endorse.\n\nIf we choose to adopt this path, we will not request any more American support outside of war material, and we will rebuff WerBell, who is only looking out for his own mercenaries. Russians know Russia best, after all, and the tactics of Russians, both Red and White, shall unite to lift the motherland from her knees.

Though the Whites found themselves defeated by the Reds, their tactics and strategy allowed them to continue fighting longer they otherwise could have. Adopting their doctrine, particularly as it pertains to the Far East, is an excellent idea.\n\nOur officers will study the underpinnings and principles of the old White Army, applying them to training our own armed forces. Though reminiscent of tactics used in the First World War, soon the conditions and harshness of Siberia will hammer a coherent doctrine out of it.

If the stories from the west are correct, it was they who drove the Germans back, reclaiming much of the sacred soil of the motherland. Endorsing their ideals and studying their tactics are two different things: a difference our officers are keen to keep in their minds.\n\nOur officers shall scour the records in the town of Magadan, and piece together a coherent doctrine from whatever we can salvage.

The splitters in Chita and Amur, along with the Reds in Buryatia and Irkutsk, will learn to fear us now.\n\nIt is now time to take this army against them.

Rather than a continuous confrontation with the enemy, the American instructors have introduced us to a novel way of confronting the enemy: to go faster than them, past the gaps of their formations, exploiting any holes in their lines.

Luckily, WerBell has a plan.\n\nMitchell WerBell is a man who knows the underworld, and it recognizes him. By pulling a few favors and greasing a few palms, the legendary mercenary can rectify the weapon shortage with ease, he claims. If Matkovsky agrees to it, he promises to fill the armories of Magadan with not only an astounding quantity of weapons but also with state of the art ones, not the cheap local productions.

However, the shortage remains, and though it isn't as severe as before, it might be wise to keep a cache of arms for a rainy day - and it rains in Siberia, most of the time if it is not snowing.\n\nLike a magician pulling one trick after another out of his hat, WerBell has another solution to offer to Matkovsky regarding the shortage. He knows the smuggling routes in the Bering Strait, safe from the watch of the Soviet remnant navy currently stationed in Kamchatka. From the south, he also knows the ways in Japanese Manchuria, hidden from the sight of the Imperial Japanese Army.

Uniting once again with the Reds to stall the advance of the Anti-Bolshevik Front, before the constituents fled to pursue their interests. Aldan is small, and by itself, it garners no concern save for the gold mine they possess.\n\nThe single line of defense in Aldan consists of militiamen and Siberian mercenaries paid their weight in gold. A campaign into Aldan would be simple, and our armies will have no trouble handling them. The question is not of ease, but of speed. If we take our opportunity now, neither the Reds nor the Father shall have access to this source of gold. Our victory in Aldan shall earn us the required funds to maintain a better, and more elite force of soldiers."

Honor is perhaps the most valuable resource in the Far East, it seems. The people of Aldan only learned this fact recently, and their identity did not survive the lesson imparted. Aldan, however, is a sparsely-populated region. To bring the gold mines up to their full potential, we would need to take some measures.\n\nThe Vozhd shall send some of his labor force to the northern mines of Aldan, using gold to incentivize settlers to go there. Once up and running, gold will pour out of these mines, to finance the war effort in the Far East. With the excess revenue brought in by the ore, we can afford a bigger army.

If for no other reason, we face the Father because he stands against all that Russia is: a holy man perverting the teachings of Christ to birth a new, doomed society.\n\nWe shall strike this apparition of Satan down from his throne. The faith of the peasant militias and dissidents shall matter little in front of an artillery barrage. We shall charge forward, anointed by the Lord, bearing the lance that strikes the beast of deceit down. The heavens above bless our Vozhd else he would not have come this far.

We should seek help in defeating this menace, once and for all.\n\nWe shall fight fire with fire. The Far Eastern Orthodox Church, although not in close communion with the churches in other parts of Russia, is still a potent ally. After all, deceit cannot silence the truth.

Their large numbers also mean that they can exploit the gaps within our lines effectively, isolating active combat units and swamping them with a relentless assault of bodies.\n\nWe need to fight smarter. Our troops are superior, but we need to find a new way to use them. We shall not give ground to them anymore. We shall study their patterns of attack and their weaknesses.

Letting him loose into Siberia may once again result in the peasants rising and rebelling against our stranglehold in the Far East. For this predicament, we shall excommunicate him and damn his memory forever. There was never a Father; it was a disorganized rebellion who rose against Matkovsky's rightful rule over the Far East.

While we have no shortage of eager fighting men, the Siberian National Republic still has no official organized military to speak of.\n\nLet us remedy this before it is too late. The green light has been given for the formation of our young republic's official ground forces: the National Republican Army.

The United States, a close partner of our regime, has one of the finest militaries on the planet at their disposal. Their troops' level of discipline is second-to-none, and we can only dream of building an army of the same kind of quality.

It was more than a farce - a poorly written, hyperbolic work of fiction authored by an uneducated youth would provide a better framework for justice than the kangaroo courts the former Vozhd held. Justice was not objective - it was served and dispensed virtually directly from Matkovsky himself via parrot judges and puppet juries, who manipulated outcomes and rid the Vozhd of his opponents.\n\nThis has long been one of the darkest stains on the legacy of our party and has until this point held up our development of the future. We must ensure that a comprehensive reform of our justice system takes place to root out those that have done Matkovsky's bidding - the corrupt, the ideological, and the cowardly; these are the people who have no business judging whether the Russian citizen is guilty or not."

It's time for a constitution. In fact, it's well past the time for a constitution. But now we have a chance to right Matkovksy's wrongs.

 MAG.1.t:0 "The Last of the True"
 MAG.1.desc:0 "Matkovsky steadied his glasses against his nose, peering down at a piece of paper with rows and rows of names written all over it. A list of Rodzaevsky's suspected loyalists. He looked up to discover a room packed to the brim with books from his White Army days, old decaying American newspapers, and in the far corner, shrouded in the dark, an old gramophone gathering rust and dust. The sight of the thing brought a smirk to Matkovsky's face: the old Harbin building, the dances and the parties, and above all of it, the electric swastika, promising another future for the Russians stranded there.\n\nThe doorbell rang, shaking Matkovsky from his reverie. Two gruff men, dressed in the party uniform, entered. In his small and messy room, they stood out as an oddity, almost barbaric even. Their feet thumped loudly on the wooden floors as they attempted clumsy salutes. One lean, with breezes of blonde hair peeking beneath the party cap. The other stocky, with the bulge of his stomach plain to the eye.\n\nAfter a few moments of awkward silence, Matkovsky stared at them, before finally saying, "Well?" With trembling voices, they gave him the names of the people they had purged today. Matkovsky gave them a generous smile. "Thank you. You may go." When he heard the door knob latch itself closed, he turned back to his list. Sergei A., Bruno B., Nikolas C. He crossed them out, dabbing the names in thick black ink, snuffing them out forever from the history of the Russian Fascist Party. Balancing his glass of whiskey in his hands, Matkovsky looked at his reflection against the murky liquid before taking a sip.\n\nThe hours went by. The doorbell rang, and the men came and did their salutes, telling him of the names disappearing from the list. Sometimes, when the wind was right, he could hear the crack of rifle fire, somewhere deep in the woods. It was nighttime by the time he finished the list. He gently pushed the men out, thanking them for a job well done. After they left, he bolted the door behind them. Turning to his gramophone, he decided that he would dance to the memories of Harbin. He turned it on and let the good times roll."

 MAG.2.t:0 "Magadan Free Radio - Broadcast 1"
 MAG.2.desc:0 "The broadcast started wrong. Before the talk show began, the Magadan Free Radio played a sequence of songs plagued by crackling audio. The inexperienced crews of the MFR, fascists unused to any other work than thuggery, had mixed the sound with too much bass and mistakenly placed the treble dial.\n\nThe audio cuts. A thump. Two thumps. "Is this thing on?" a coarse voice said, his lips smacking too close against the microphone, "Oh, it is!"\n\nAnother voice, a smooth baritone, said from a far corner of the room "We're live, what the hell are you saying?" Trembling on the table, as the voice closed in. Three taps on the table. "Follow the script." An awkward pause. "Did you forget to disconnect the microphone? Did you?" A sigh. "This is such a fucking disaster." An electric discharge sounded as the mic was unplugged. The badly mastered songs continued, rattling the first broadcast of the MFR.\n\nThe audio cuts out, again. The coarse voice returned, still a little too close to the mic, "Hello, fellow Russians in the Far East. Welcome to the very first broadcast of Magadan Free Radio." Lip-smacking. "My name is Sergei, I'm the host of the radio tonight, alongside with my friend, Vasi..." Sergei's voice trailed off. A few moments later, he shouted into the mic, likely blowing out a few eardrums, "Vasily!"\n\nVasily took his seat, audibly. With a little sigh, he began, "Yes, with my friend Sergei here, we shall accompany you through many, many cold siberian nights in the future." An affected cheer. "For now, we'd like to thank Mr. Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the RFP, for sponsoring this program." An awkward silence, as the clocks ticked in the background. "For now, let's proceed with the music."\n\nJust before the audio turned on again, the smooth baritone said, "What the fuck is wrong with yo-""

 MAG.3.desc:0 ""To the Honorable Claimant to the Throne of Russia," the letter read so far, "we have come to beseech you for your aid against our mutual enemy, the traitor Konstantin Rodzaevsky." No, the letter ought not to be so direct. Putting down his pen, Matkovsky laid his hand across his face and sighed. Leaning his forearm against the table and propping his head against his open palm, he stared at the page, waiting to be filled with his writing. His tea sat right below him, its smell tempting him. Matkovsky tapped his feet. He has no time for that now.\n\nFor the first time in a long while, Matkovsky found himself adjusting his glasses, his fingers rapping the table in sequence. A thousand questions swarmed his mind. What if the Tsarists reject the treaty? What if they find the terms unacceptable? He shuddered to think of what would happen if both sides did not cooperate against Rodzaevsky. Someone knocked on the door. Rather than answering, Matkovsky's index finger mimicked the rhythm on his table.\n\nStanding from his seat, he said aloud, "The letter is not ready yet. Go away." The knockings stopped. He looked at the letter. Clapping his hands together and drawing a deep breath, he sat down, toying with the pen as he thought of what to say to Mikhail.\n\n"We appeal in the name of our old friendship," he scribbled without much thought, "in the Anti-Bolshevik Front. As we all know..." He found his hands picking up speed. Before long, he would stand and say:"

 MAG.4.t:0 "Saboteurs Strike!"

The minds of Mikhail and Matkovsky are foggy and unclear as ever.\n\nThis morning, our forward observers have found our border guards dead, and their weapons missing. This incident is hardly isolated. The intensifying raids coming from both sides of the border, as well as the destruction of valuable remnants of Union roads and rail, have become more and more frequent. Our forces are stretched thin, barely enough to cover one side of the front. When the tsarists attack, the traitors join them, forcing us to expend our resources in two directions. We inevitably lose some in the process: whether it is men, weapons, or plain loot.\n\nRodzaevsky sits in his office, pondering what to do next. This pact has marked a turning point in the relationship between the three components of the Anti-Bolshevik Front. One can only wonder what fate awaits them next. Will the tsarists and the traitors win against the divinely-sanctioned Vozhd of Russia or truth triumph against treachery? Only time will tell."

 MAG.5.t:0 "The Man in the White House"
 MAG.5.desc:0 "Nikolai Petlin adjusted his tie. A mental tick, something he learned a long time ago in the RFP. Looking over his desk, he ruminated on the task Matkovsky had assigned to him. A typewriter, surrounded by rolls and rolls of ink, practically a luxury. Petlin could not imagine writing those letters and appeals by hand. He had spent long hours in this office, and his fingers twitched as he prepared himself to type again. His assistants could only do so much; none spoke English, and to ask Matkovsky for aid would overstep propriety.\n\nHe sighed. He remembered the words Matkovsky told him. "Convince the man in the White House," his master had said, staring into Petlin's eyes without flinching, "That is all." Matkovsky did not like being taken lightly. At the best of times, Petlin could see the old Harbin spirit in him, a spirit of hope, of kindling, of a prayer for a new home. The winter had extracted its toll upon the man, and the gaunt, flushed cheeks were but symptoms of the payment.\n\nHe looked beneath his desk. Stacks upon stacks of paper, numbering almost in the thousands. Soon, upon the completion of his task, these would be sent to America, finding themselves in the mailboxes of Senators, Representatives, Russian émigrés, and other assorted people who were receptive to Matkovsky's project. On top of the furthest stack, lay a folder, bound in manilla yellow. Plastered to the front of it was a label that read: "The Siberian Bill of Rights." The document contained Petlin's personal ideas to solicit more aid, or at least sympathy from Americans. He wondered if Matkovsky knew what his real sympathies were.\n\nHe shook his head. Now was not the time for the mind to wander. He laid his fingers upon the keys of the typewriter, and the clacking began."

 MAG.6.t:0 "The Count of Fascism"
 MAG.6.desc:0 ""Zdarova, brother Matkovsky!" A man hailed from the piers of the harbor. A lean body and a pale face, with a hand stretching out in the early morning air, waving to Matkovsky. Anastasy Vonsiatsky, also known as the Count of Russian Fascism, had set foot on the port of Magadan. He strode forward, his steps eager and his gait quick, impatient to meet his so-called equal in the old world. Covering his nose once he discovered the smell of the docks, he looked small, pathetic against the backdrop of wooden fishing ships about to depart into the morning light.\n\nMatkovsky furrowed his eyebrows. No one in this world currently has the right to address him in such a way. Giving an awkward, pained smile towards Vonsiatsky, he and his bodyguards walked forward to meet this Count. Extending his hand, a gesture of hospitality, Matkovsky said, "Zdrastvuyte. How has America treated you?"\n\nVonsiatsky wasted no breath in clasping Matkovsky's open palms. "Great, brother." He leaned forward, planning to catch Matkovsky in a hug. Matkovsky relented. America must have changed Vonsiatsky. The intimate gestures, the overenthusiastic, unreserved spirit, and that greeting: it was all a bit much, coming from a fellow Russian. Still drunk in that spirit, Vonsiatsky said aloud, "It is the land of the free. All this," he gestured with his hand, "Is too small for us."\n\n"You seem to forget the reason you are here, brother." Matkovsky said, a hint of coldness in his voice.\n\n"No, no." He dipped his hands in his pocket. "This man is a gift from me to you." He showed Matkovsky a black and white photograph of an American in a beret."

 MAG.7.t:0 "The Wizard of Whispering Death"
 MAG.7.desc:0 "A light curtain of drizzle had descended upon the port of Magadan. The clouds adorned their bodies with steely grey, and the waters of the harbor tugged and pushed their way inland, their course halted the low-lying sea walls. Amid the piers, rows upon rows of wooden fishing ships lay steady, their hulls quivering in the fierce wind, shallow rain, and restive waves. There was one vessel that stood out among the others, a metal deck, with rust coating its bows. The tumultuous air did not even seem to flinch it.\n\nMatkovsky, followed by an aide bearing an umbrella to shield him from the downpour, walked forward to this strange vessel. If Vonsiatsky had been speaking the truth, then there was no question to the owner of this ship. Mitchell WerBell, legendary mercenary, the veteran of a thousand wars worldwide, an infamous soldier of fortune, the Wizard of Whispering death. Matkovsky steeled himself to meet this legend of a man, before seeing a figure stumbling out of the ship, staggering towards him.\n\nMatkovsky blinked. There was no mistaking it. The figure was WerBell, looking more green than in the photographs Matkovsky had seen of him, a beret hanging precariously to his scalp. Matkovsky tightened his pace, striding forward at such a pace that his aide had difficulty in following him. When he came face to face with WerBell, the man tried to give a clumsy smile, only for it to be mistaken for contempt.\n\n"Welcome," Matkovsky said, in English, "We have been expecting you, Mr. WerBell."\n\n"Privet," WerBell said, "My tovarisch." He continued in Russian, mixing it with English words when he had no clue which words to use. Matkovsky, for his part, tried to dissuade him from bastardizing the Russian language, and occasionally a word or two made it through WerBell's manners, but he was inconsolable. What little correct Russian he spoke was sprinkled with generous helpings of "fucking" and "shit." Blushing furiously in anger and embarrassment, Matkovsky finally extended his hand.\n\n"Here's," Matkovsky said, trying to keep his smile in place, "To a start of a beautiful friendship." WerBell clasped his hand with neither doubt nor comprehension."

The Vozhd is waiting for you!"\n\n"It's no use, Dmitry," Ivan said, sighing and catching his breath, "I've been at this door for hours, and I haven't gotten any answers yet."\n\nTime to try something else, Dmitry thought. Kneeling, he stared at the keyhole of the doorknob. He could do this. Taking out a lockpick from his pockets, Dmitry gingerly inserted it, working as to leave the machinations inside undisturbed and unharmed. The door had to open somehow, and jamming the keyhole would only make it harder for everyone. Might even require an ax: he chuckled. Ivan was about to protest, several times, in fact. They could've just asked for a spare key, but Dmitry wouldn't hear of it.\n\nThe door clicked. Dmitry stood, containing his jump at the very last moment. "See?" He said to Ivan, who gave a dry smile in response. Dmitry turned the knob, but the door wouldn't budge. "Bolted from the inside, goddamnit!" He kicked the door in a fit of rage. Ivan tapped his shoulder, gesturing for him to move. Brandishing an ax, he swung it several times against the door, as bits and pieces of wood fly in every direction. At the very last moment, when Ivan was about to give up, the door gave way.\n\n"Mr. Vonsiatsky, are you not we-" Ivan stopped mid-sentence, laying on the floor and clutching his chest was Vonsiatsky, his eyes glassy, his face pale. He was dead.\n\nSometime in the evening, the phone in Matkovsky's office rang."

 MAG.9.desc:0 "Ivan and Boris did not like their new assignment. Transferred from the political wing of the RFP to the army right before the eve of the operation, they were, as their instructor put it, "dead weight." An officer handed them their bolt-action rifles and told them to stick with the rear guard, where the chance of survival was the highest. There was no danger here, and the Siberian woods were quiet, the wind whistling between the trees and the air cold as ever.\n\n"You think the Vozhd will let us back?" Boris asked Ivan, who was squatting beside him, watching the surroundings while smoking a flimsy cigarette. The only reply he got was a listless shake of the head and a hush. Ivan knew his stuff or at least showed that he wasn't in over his head. The hand that gripped the cig shook. It could be the air, could be genuine anxiety and terror in the face of war.\n\nA figure passed ahead, in the dirt trails they were watching: a mercenary. It was apparent from the gear they carried. Proper camouflage, an assault rifle, a belt chock-full of grenades as well as other miscellaneous tools of warfare, and, most importantly, the attitude. The man walked forward without any concern or worry, his footsteps lighter than the bravest man in the RFP. However, he had no reason to be here. The front lines were where he belonged, not here.\n\n"Halt!" Boris said, unslinging in his rifle and pointing it at the mercenary, who did likewise. Ivan followed suit. "Turn back. The frontlines are over there."\n\nThe mercenary said nothing and shot at Boris. It hit, and Boris was thrown off his feet. Ivan fired back, nailing the mercenary in the shoulder.\n\nAll over the lines, incidents like these flared up, and the operation was called off in a panic. WerBell's coup had begun."

 MAG.10.t:0 "The Treaty of Cooperation"
 MAG.10.desc:0 ""Here is the treaty that the Tsarists sent," Petlin said, placing the draft of the agreement on the table, "sir." He almost adjusted his tie again, before the stern stare of the Vozhd stopped his left hand. Yet those eyes did not judge Petlin's mannerisms in any detail. They went up and down the document, examining its fine print, looking for chinks in the deal that the Tsarists - or the RFP, for that matter - could exploit. No word on it seemed to raise any reaction from Matkovsky beyond an occasional rise of the eyebrows and a nod.\n\nPutting the document aside, Matkovsky turned to address his foreign minister. "Petlin," he said, chilling every bone in the minister's body. He gulped. It was the moment of truth, where the Vozhd would deliver his final verdict. "Good work," Matkovsky said after a few moments, "you exceeded my personal expectations. Before I sign this," he picked up his pen, toying with it, "is there anything else you'd like to add?"\n\nPetlin drew a deep breath. "No," he said, "There is none." Matkovsky's hand promptly drew a signature on the document.\n\n"It is done." He dropped the pen and rose. "Deliver this to the representative of the Tsarists and tell him that the Vozhd accepts the deal, and death to Rodzaevsky." Standing in front of Petlin, he offered his hand. "I appreciate that I have at least one competent person in charge of affairs around here." A smile, a rare thing for Matkovsky to show.\n\nPetlin shook his hand. "Yes, sir. I will do as you say. Your compliments are high praise for my blood and station, sir."\n\nMatkovsky patted his shoulder. "All in a day's work." Petlin turned and left where he came in."

Tonight was a special night, a time to talk with an old friend. So long as she also held to her schedule, that is. Ten seconds out. WerBell rubbed his hands against his temples.

They turned the dial to Magadan Free Radio, whose frequency they had scribbled onto a piece of paper earlier.\n\nThe mix was better this time.

Waking up to greet the new day, he lifted his sidearm and looked over it, balancing it in his hands as he did so. Apart from some dirt stains, it was clean. He pressed the magazine release, and then pulled the slide back. A cartridge flew into the air with a faint ping. All the bullets were there.\n\nSo far, Oleg did not have to use his gun on anything. No bear nor leopard even came close to him, although he did see them in the wild. The foxes, rabbits, and other assorted animals he hunted were the results of his traps. Using the gun on them would ruin their flavor and make them possible unsafe to eat. To survive, Oleg learned, one must be ready to not only exercise force, but also restraint.\n\nHe picked up the stray bullet and shoved it back into its magazine. Time for his daily ritual. Setting himself down, Oleg began taking apart his gun. Setting the parts down on dried rabbit fur, he took out his canteen, and started cleaning the parts delicately. After each piece was free of grime and dust, he rubbed them on the fur, making sure they were dry. With icy fingers, he assembled the gun. To see if anything was wrong, he slid the magazine back and cocked the action. A snap. Oleg smiled. Today was a good day too.\n\nThe Siberian Rangers would come back for him, any day now."

They shouldn't have bothered. On his face, the fire that had burned bright during the darkest moments of the RFP in Harbin was naught but cold embers. His hands and legs chained, he hobbled forward, dragging his feet and maintaining a precarious balance and momentum.\n\nAt their front was a makeshift gallows, constructed with the sole intent of executing the former chief leader of the RFP. The Bandit King of Amur, as he was known, now walked like the poorest beggar in the Far East, towards his impending death. Three men patrolled the site on Matkovsky's orders, making sure the execution was as private as possible. For all he had done, Rodzaevsky was still a former member of the RFP, a party that takes care of its own.\n\n"Stop right there," a guard said, right beneath the stairs to his doom, "I have something to ask." Rodzaevsky suppressed the urge to giggle at this man; what can a dying man say in the face of his fate? He nodded. "What did the Vozhd say to you last night?" All eyes were now on Rodzaevsky, every ear tuned to hear what he had to say.\n\n"Nothing much," Rodzaevsky said, sotto voce, "can we get this over already?" He intended to carry what Matkovsky said to his grave. The guards brought him to the rope, then placed it around his neck. They made him stand on a stool, before aiming their rifles at him again, prepared for a last, desperate escape attempt.\n\nThere was no need.

So far, using vodka, scraps of clothing, and the bandages he found on the merc's body, Ivan had managed to staunch the bleeding, the blood gathering in dark red clots beneath the bandage's white veneer. Boris moaned every time they went up and down crossing the rough Siberian terrain, but his ragged breathing and delirious groans meant that one thing was clear: he was alive.\n\nAll the way, from the lines back to the camp, Ivan screamed until his throat was sore, "Medic! MEDIC!" Yet, the grounds were silent, and the trees and bushes did not accept nor condemn his call for help. Boris was growing heavier by the minute, his weight settling into Ivan's shoulders like a cross. His breath became shorter and shorter, as the woods refuse to part way and yield to the camp.\n\nNot far now, Ivan thought, for every step he took. Not far. Every rock, fallen branch, and mound of soil endeared themselves to his eyes and feet, as he slowed down. He was close to fainting. He took his knife out and tried to prick his thumb lightly; his touch was less than gentle, and in his panic, he slashed his hand. The wound was not deep, just enough to keep him awake. He bandaged his hands, taking a slower and measured pace.\n\nIn half an hour, he reached the camp, finding it empty and deserted. Night had descended. The medical staff had fled, along with most of the troops. Had he been faster, had he been quicker, he could have saved Boris. He laid his friend down on the ground, and held his hand, as Boris's breath faded, fainter and fainter. He tried. He really did. Fate had not given leave for Boris to survive.\n\nLuck did, however. A truck horn sounded, and in their headlights was Ivan, holding his friend's hand and his tears at bay. He could not believe it.

Their equipment was in a similarly poor state, with most "soldiers" equipped with creaking, almost non-functional rifles like old Arisaka models and Mosin-Nagants dating back to the days of the Great War. A good fit for an army of wax models in a museum, perhaps, but not enough for a host with the intent to fight, as the Vozhd (Russian leader) humbly put it, "a total crusade to save Russia."\n\nWe commenced training as soon as we pinned down the RFP's situation. That is where we encountered another problem: the nepotism ingrained within the "officer corps" of the RFP was so prevalent that men who could barely hold the weight of a rifle bore such high ranks as Lieutenant, Captain, or even Major. Pressed on the issue, the Vozhd agreed to fire these people immediately, much to his credit. He also approved the building of several officer schools to whip up the higher ranks of his army into shape.\n\nThe reports we have received from the frontlines indicate good results. The border clashes against their neighbors have indicated a good increase in performance, regardless of victory and defeat. We will continue to monitor the situation and issue reports whenever possible. Mason out."

In Magadan, they walked around town, their expensive gear strapped to their bodies, flirting with girls and ladies they see along the way. They seemed not to have a care for Russia; it was just another playground for them, a vacation, a holiday in a desolate land where they got to shoot the natives. Smith (no given last name), in particular, came from South Africa, his hands itching for the trigger of the gun, his ears for the thrill of gunfire, his head and brain for the conduct and raw barbarity of combat.\n\nWerBell wasn't lying when he said that his gear was going to be good. His M16, strapped to his back, was the meanest piece of lead spitter this side of Russia. The RFP militias did not have them, only given old US M1 Garands instead, for they were not Smith. The fields, savannahs, plains, and jungles of Africa made themselves known through his copper, sun-burnt skin. He had all the reason in the world to be cocky. When his folks back home ask him why he had gone into the business, "To find a lady," came the answer. All who truly understood Smith knew that he wasn't in it for love, but the thrill of war and money.\n\nHe could see the Russians eyeing his gear with envy in their eyes. He smirked at them and winked. Every time he smoked, they would marvel at his tidy, clean, well-rolled cigarettes. Once in a while, he offered them one, even. Warfare was a trade, and business was good. Leaning back against a wall in a random part of the podunk town, he took one of his fabulous cigarettes out and lit one.\n\nFor a backwater and deserted place, Magadan was pretty good. Not on the level of Bloemfontein, but pleasant enough. However, his heart was never there. Out west, closer to lines of the tsarists and Rodzaevsky's loyalists, beneath the blazing gunfire and artillery bombardments, was where he belonged.

Alcohol, drugs, coffee, every substance of comfort crowded the lone desk perched on the far end of the room, in front of the open windows. The afternoon sun's faint light filtered into the room, and the glasses of Rodzaevsky's excess glimmered like gems against the backdrop of the steel-gray sky.\n\nCovering his nose through the rank smell, he reached a drawer and pulled a file out. M section, Matkovsky, Mikhail. His photo, young and handsome, graced the file. Its pages were surprisingly clean, tidily typed. At first glance, it could pass for a well-written letter. The contents and notes of it stood in contrast to its exterior. Long, run-on sentences cursed Matkovsky, and a phrase drew his eye: "Kosher Fascist." Matkovsky smiled. Never change, old friend, never change.\n\nAll that remained, then, was to compile a list. Though most of the RFP were Russians, Matkovsky's wing of the party could not accept Rodzaevsky's without some adjustments. Some would follow the fate of their master. Some would be free to find their fortunes in the wastes of Siberia. Some would be the RFP's prodigious children, wayward sons of Russia who lost their way. All would serve Matkovsky.

We need to-"\n\n"I get your point, Petlin, it's just," Matkovsky said, waving off Petlin, "This is not what I - not we - stand for. When I read your document I found phrases like the 'Right to assembly', 'right to free speech.' These are all dangerous ideas, not fit for Russia. Their rebellious intent practically jumps off the pages." Matkovsky sighed, "Just what the hell were you thinking, brother?"\n\nPetlin gathered himself and stood straighter. "Sir, if I may insist, my ideas can still be useful. Not only in convincing the Americans but the Russians as well." He cracked his knuckles in anxiety.

It wasn't exactly an ideal situation for a government that needed bodies and industry as fast as possible. As a number of his ministers filed in, all of them presumably having been briefed on the nature of the meeting, Matkovsky turned to them. In his well-known, tactful manner, he addressed his audience. "It's clear that our current... industrial situation is untenable". Continuing, moving aside to show his ministers the map. "We need to take action to ensure that we're not overwhelmed by our southern rivals. It's no secret that they enjoy Japan's material support."\n\nOne minister, Goltsov, spoke up. "It will take some work, of course, but I have been thinking the same thing, we cannot allow ourselves to be outcompeted by our rivals. A few proposals can be drawn up, my Vozhd. Industrialization, under the direct supervision of the government, attracting any potential foreign investment by any means necessary."\n\nMatkovsky looked around the room, waiting for any other comments before continuing. "Good, please do. I don't plan on matching Rodzaevsky and the Whites, I want to outstrip their production." Tacit nods from most followed - Matkovsky made his intentions clear. He wanted to turn Magadan into a city of industry. Not an easy task, certainly, for Magadan's earliest purpose was as a stop-off for the work camps and mines in the region. But if the Vozhd thought it best, it was probably best. And every person in the room, Matkovsky included, knew that if the Vozhd wanted it, it would be done.

The chilly morning air seemed not to have any effect on the Vozhd, who was in full military dress, as he and his high command approached the troops in formation. All of the soldiers were dressed as he was and sported their weapons of war, but even before he approached them, Matkovsky could tell what poor soldiers they would make. His generals exchanged nervous glances with one another.\n\nOne soldier was too fat, the other malnourished. The third was too short and the fourth didn't have his uniform's buttons done up right. They all had the full uniform, but it seemed as if they had simply borrowed bits and pieces from their peers, as a lot of them didn't fit. All of them, not just these four, were equipped with weapons that looked like they had been outdated by the time the Germans were ravaging the west of Russia. This sorry state of affairs made it blatantly obvious to Matkovsky that on one of the most important days of their lives, these troops could barely muster together even the smallest shred of professionalism. The inspection ended, Matkovsky politely walking along the columns of the Magadan garrison, taking mental notes. Scruffy beards, outdated weapons, ill discipline. Matkovsky knew that it wasn't their fault, for the most part. He had a chronic shortage of bodies, weapons, and officers, all of which were necessary for raising and maintaining a professional army.\n\nAfter the inspection, he had called a meeting of his high command, where a rare flare of anger shone through his usual professional behavior. "What is going on? These are the best troops that you have to offer me?" he asked his generals. A number of cursory excuses were offered, but Matkovsky put his hand up to demand their silence. "I don't want to hear it. If those are the men who guard the capital, what do those on the front lines look like? How do you think we will overcome Rodzaevsky, let alone retake the entirety of Russia? I don't care what the solution is, I want you to find it. And I want to be briefed on it this time tomorrow.""

Matkovksy's generals and administration had taken upon themselves to figure out some way to improve the true RFP's fighting ability. "The answer was simple", mused one senior officer. "When we realized we couldn't use conscripts, we bought soldiers from abroad instead". Indeed, mercenaries and military advisors, state-sponsored or otherwise, have been slowly but surely streaming into the frozen port of Magadan to not only pad Matkovsky's army of ill-suited conscripts, but to train them as well, to crack the whip and bring them, kicking and screaming, into the world of professionalism. The fat ones were now skinny, the malnourished ones healthy. All of them had a semblance of fighting spirit for the first time ever, and the guns, while still archaic, were at least cleaned and maintained properly. Training, as barebones as it was, actually began to prepare the conscripts and their mercenary counterparts for the realities of modern warfare in the frigid forests and marshes of Siberia. All this of course was tacked on to a very long and expensive bill that Matkovsky had to pass off to his administration. He was confident that there would be something for them to pay the mercenaries with.\n\nAfter Matkovsky's second inspection of the troops, which like the first, was kept as a surprise, he once again called a meeting with his general staff. As they filed in, worried that the new inspection was not enough of an improvement from the original, many nervously fiddled with pens, or reports, while others looked anywhere but where Matkovsky stood. As they all assembled, the Vozhd spoke. "After this second inspection", he said, in his normal, reserved manner, "I want to say good job, to all of you". Many were surprised. "I know that the task I assigned to you was not an easy one, and while we're far from perfect, I am pleased with the progress that we're making. The path to seek out mercenaries and foreign support was not one that I would have expected, but it's clearly working, and I will be meeting with some top advisors about how to increase the numbers and effectiveness of these foreigners".

I am patient, but my friends here are not. I kept begging them, but they wouldn't leave you alone. I beg you, fulfill their simple wishes, and pay. Once you pay up I'll have your back again."\n\nBogdan didn't have anything else. Business had been slow since the fall of the Union, and chaos wasn't exactly great for commerce. He hung on to his shop with a kind of stubborn nostalgia, dreaming that the old times might return. He turned to his office, and to address his tormentors: "Wait a moment." Kneeling beneath his desk, he found his family safe and unlocked it. A gun, and his late wife's jewelry. His hand inched towards the pistol, but he stopped mid-motion. Not today. Not wise. He took her wedding ring and handed it to Vlad.\n\n"I am so glad," Vlad said, "that you decided to relent. After all, you are one of our favorite customers.""

His printing press followed all of the party's guidelines and regulations, and he lent them his business from time to time to print propaganda. However, on nights like these, with the moon nowhere in sight and accompanied by a single oil lamp, he let his facade drop. He unscrewed his flask and drank some terrible vodka he had saved from the local distillery. Wretched stuff, but there was nothing better. The party took the cream of the crop for themselves.\n\nHe returned to his desk, his figure throwing shadows in all directions. Sergei was in his office, in his element. He considered lighting up a cigarette while he worked, but decided against it. Sitting down, he glanced at the pamphlets he had written, satisfied at his work. Soon, the "garbage collection detail" would come and collect his pieces, distributing them among the streets of Magadan. He paid them a small sum to keep quiet about it.\n\nLeaning down, Sergei almost dozed off before a thought knocked on his skull. Why did he do this? Resistance to the party was minuscule, and his men were more loyal to his money than anything else he could offer. He looked at his oil lamp, its fuel running low, a single candle-light holding out against a backdrop of darkness. The symbolism was not lost on Sergei. Perhaps in a few days, in a few weeks, maybe even a year, he would find himself in a basement, moments away from being snuffed out. He put aside his worries.\n\nA knock sounded.

Thomas sat in the projection booth, nursing a bottle of vodka personally given by the Vozhd, who was sitting at the front. He took a sip, expecting the bitter flavor to overwhelm him. Instead, it felt light, tasting of dirt. Horrible. He put it down, settling it behind his ankles.\n\nThomas stared at the image, a blurry mess of green blobs charging black dots on the screen. Today's movie was an adaptation of a famous American comic book, Captain America. For Thomas, a connoisseur supreme of the movie industry, this film was trash. Its projection and audio were even worse than the script. He had found out too late that the lenses didn't fit, and he had to prop it in with some tape. The result was a screen infested with a permanent blur, and the crackling, scarce, and incomplete audio made the viewing experience into something fantastical.\n\nMikhail Matkovsky - the Vozhd of the Russians, as he styled himself - sat at the front. A charismatic, almost intimidating man, it was almost comical to see him laughing at what Americans would think was garbage. Intelligence, it seemed, did not uplift taste.\n\nThe hero charged at the enemy, and the brown blots collapsed and tumbled backward. The crowd cheered, and the air was that of discordant revelry.

Maybe a pack of cigarettes, or even a can of powdered coffee. In his head, he toyed with the image of the Vozhd wearing something made from the lovely hide of this moose.\n\nAs usual, the RFP officials and thugs guarded every entrance to the city, their brown uniforms contrasting with the pale buildings of the town. However, Nikita noticed that the RFP now had new companions among their ranks. Sharply dressed men and women armed to the teeth and speaking a thousand foreign languages, congealing into a Tower of Babel manifested in the outskirts of Russia. It was quite the sight, with the mercenaries keeping to themselves and the Russians eternally suspicious of what was going on. The officials cleared him to enter the town, provided that he left his rifle in their checkpoint.\n\nHe sold the hide for some good cash. Money he could use to buy bullets, provisions, food, and medical supplies to last him for another week. There was something new to the town, however: American products. American coffee, cigarettes, and even radio were available, and quite common even. They were cheaper than native-Magadan goods, although they were often sold out by the end of the day.

They expected the night to go on as smoothly as it always did, a cruise into the moonlight as the games continued, pockets emptying and men filing into the street with the grace of drunken feet.\n\nThree listless men entered into the bar, new arrivals in Magadan. They were WerBell's men, heavily armed and heartily paid: professional soldiers that hailed from all corners of the world. They had too much free time. At first they and the locals got along quite nicely, which is to say they did not interact much at all. Only silent nods and scarce eye contact bridged the difference between the group.\n\nThe uneasy truce did not last long. The listless men flirted with the girls behind the counter, and the locals did not like it. Standing up, they shouted profanities at the mercenaries in a language they did not understand. It did not take long for the soldiers to unholster their pistols and threaten the locals. It only took a minute before one of the mercenaries accidentally fired a shot, resulting in a dead civilian who was only found hours later after the rioting that ensued.\n\nThe locals, instead of being driven back by gunshots, charged the armed men, using broken bottles and chairs to attack the new arrivals. WerBell's mercenaries, dispatched as a backup for the new arrivals, got involved shortly. The party's police, who intervened to stop more bloodshed, were met with a rain of bullets and jagged glass.\n\nAfter a dozen dead civilians, and two dozen more wounded, the riots were finally put down by force.

Now, as the sun was setting, its orange light aged his features beyond the man's already formidable years. He had joined the party since its first days in Harbin, and was a veteran of the Anti-Bolshevik Front.\n\nPeople from inside the party, further up in the hierarchy call her father Vlad the Tall, in mockery of his height. Outside the party, they called him a thug, a criminal, a robber vested with a RFP uniform. Sometimes he could see his reputation manifest itself when he met his neighbors. Small business owners, shopkeepers, and the fishermen of the port looked at him with a mix of fear, reprehension, and disgust. Any time any of them dared to cross Vlad's path, however, they scurried away almost immediately when he drew his gun, a trusty Nambu he had kept by his side for years, again, since the days of Harbin.\n\nIn Katerina's eyes, however, she did not find a monster in the figure of her father, standing as a single silhouette against the dying day.

Following Barbarossa and the Soviet Union's collapse, the CIA could scarcely glean any information from that vast country. Except for the West Russian War of the 50s, the Russia of our imagination had become a cesspool of violent infighting, with the German bombings preventing any attempts of regional warlords to consolidate power.\n\nAt least, this seems to be the case in West Russia and Siberia. With a land area that stretched from the Baltic to the Pacific, there are some stretches of territory untouched by the banditry and chaos that plagues the areas adjacent to the German Reich. From Central Siberia, the primary recipient of the Bukharin-era Siberian Plan, we have heard that a Republic had risen and collapsed there between the Second World War and the West Russian War.\n\nThen there is the Russian Far East - a region that the CIA has been observing for quite some time. In brief, the legitimate government of the Soviet Union (under the provisional leadership of Genrikh Yagoda) retreated there after their defeat; subsequently, the Anti-Bolshevik Front sprang out from Manchuria and Harbin, making significant gains before shattering into three parts based on Chita, Magadan, and Amur.\n\nIn particular interest of this briefing is the Free State of Magadan, led by Mikhail Matkovsky - a local fascist of some repute. He and his foreign minister, Nikolay Petlin, has promised reforms and democracy should the U.S. support their bid for the - as the Matkovsky insisted - "great crusade for Russia," as well as intelligence and information.\n\nThe Agency notes that the decision is the President's alone to make. However, it cautions the President in supporting any fascist bid for Russia. Moreover, the aforementioned minister, Petlin, seems to be a more malleable candidate for leadership. Whatever the President decides, the Agency shall carry out."

 magexp.1.t:0 "The Puppet Tsar"
 magexp.1.desc:0 ""Is the meal to your liking," Matkovsky said, as his hands cut another piece of beef, "Mr. Romanov?" Sitting across from him was the alleged Tsar, Mikhail. Candlelight illuminated those eyes that a few days ago had seen the muzzle-fire of rifles as the RFP stormed the "palace" where Mikhail ruled. The truth was, despite the regal garb and silverware elegant enough to act as a mirror, Mikhail was no more than a puppet for the old-style White Army types. While he waited for the response from this "Tsar," Matkovsky put his fork to his mouth, tasting the ragged, almost-done taste of the steak. Not good, not terrible.\n\nMikhail chewed, swallowed, and set down his utensils. Before he spoke, he wiped his mouth with a napkin. Taking up a glass of wine, he turned to regard Matkovsky, his gaze crisp and calm. "It was," Mikhail said, straightening to deliver his verdict, "an adequate dinner." Matkovsky smiled at him. From what he heard about the reluctant Tsar, Mikhail was never one to hold back his honesty. For all the legitimacy he lacked, Mikhail had one thing many in the Front did not have, from the monarchists to the fascists: a spine. He took a sip. Putting his glass down with a silent thud, Mikhail said, "Mr. Matkovsky, perhaps you will entertain a question from this humble prisoner."\n\n"Speak your mind," Matkovsky said, the dinner practically over at this point, "your "Majesty""."\n\n"I realize that my position in Russia has grown rather... tenuous." Mikhail gave himself a chuckle. "Not that it has been well in the first place, but there you go." Leaning back, an act of defiance against royal etiquette, he drew a deep, heavy sigh. "So, what'll happen to me now?"\n\nMatkovsky stared at him, deliberating. This "Tsar" was a potential danger. Mikhail could be a dangerous contender for power. On the other hand, the monarchist strain in the RFP was wearing away and fast. Soon, no one would take Mikhail's claim seriously, and letting him go into exile, far away from Russia, might be the prudent - and decent - decision. Matkovsky opened his mouth to speak."

In one quick gasp, he expelled all of it out, letting his lungs bask in the warmth of the fumes and smoke. It had been an excellent day. As the Vozhd, he recognized that his work would never cease, but the heights! Oh, the heights that he had reached. From the underling of a madman into the head of the new Anti-Bolshevik Front. He snorted. Life was absurd; life was good.\n\nIn front of him was no alcohol, no whiskey, no vodka. He was drunk from another substance that had addicted him since the beginning of his career. Photo albums, in black and white, as well as in color, filled the surface of his desk. From the times of the old RFP in Harbin to the first incursion to Siberia, he had it all. Here he was, standing next to Rodzaevsky and Semyonov. There he was, inspecting the troops in the name of his old master, their black uniforms standing in contrast against a frozen background. He was young then. A true believer. A wry and sorrowful smile rose on his lips. If only men did not change. His mind wandered over the photographs, searching in vain for that turn in destiny that would perhaps have preserved their brotherhood. He found none.\n\nHe drew on his cigar again.

Petlin and Pavlov went up and down the piers, their silhouettes dark against the pale, weak morning light.\n\nA random thought struck him. They had not found WerBell's body. Try as he might, with his men spread out across the tundras and forests of Siberia, he could not find him. He sighed and breathed the scent of the sea. Wherever the mercenary was, he did not care. Dead or alive, WerBell was out of his way. He stepped forward and strode onto the docks.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSomewhere in the world, a soft rock tune played in the background of a tropical cafe, overlooking a beach. A gruff, balding man sat in the corner, reading a newspaper, his cup of coffee untouched. He had to settle for cigarettes. He had fun in some exotic locale recently, and it was a crying shame that it ended. Fucking fascists. First they wouldn't pay, and now they kicked him out. What had the world come down to? He shook his head. No more honest employers these days, it seemed.\n\nHe put the papers down. For the first time since the morning, he tasted the coffee. Mud.

Surplus arms from the U.S. arsenals distributed among the soldiers have had an incredible effect, and the officer training has borne fruit. I can say without hesitation that the Vozhd's army is the most advanced in the Far Eastern territories; praise only checked by the old, military adage: they still have room to grow. The prospects of the Vozhd's "Crusade", - a term he insists on to no end - seems bright.\n\nContinuing from the last report, the RFP in Magadan has defeated their counterparts in Amur. Along with this development, they quickly broke the truce they had with the Tsarists in Chita and toppled the Tsar there. In one fell swoop, Matkovsky has succeeded in reunifying the old Anti-Bolshevik Front, albeit by force. Barring other emergent factions in the area, we are confident in saying that the Vozhd currently possesses the strongest forces in the East in terms of personnel and industrial capacity.\n\nHowever, we feel the need to qualify this series of rapid progress. There remains another significant force in the Far East: the Reds and the hardline RFP. The only main concern that the RFP and U.S. personnel note are the rumors from the Northern Siberia, of a religious leader amassing power among the tribes there. Though the probability of the RFP's victory remains high, we recommend further and closer inspection of regional developments. Mason out."

He laid his fingers on the lines that demarked the boundaries between the two mortal enemies. In the dark cold of his office, he could feel the heat rise to his touch, as decades of hatred and enmity burned in the frontlines.\n\nA thud. Petlin didn't mind it. It was probably an aide stumbling their way through the dark. He looked outside the windows of his little room. The night was bright, with momentary gaps of darkness, as the clouds conspired to keep the light of the full moon for themselves. In the coming days - he did not know when, maybe in a week or a month - would be the days of another confrontation. He sighed. If only there were another way. A knock on the door woke him up from his reverie.\n\n"Coffee, sir?" an aide said, bringing a tray full of the hot black liquid, steam rising from the cups, "I thought you wanted some, as I made some for the men."\n\n"Put it on my desk," he said, breathing a sigh of relief. At least, it wasn't the Vozhd, come to check up on his work. "Mind the map." The aide gingerly placed Petlin's cup on the northern edges of the map, its fragrant fumes spreading its way through the room. As he lifted the tray, however, he knocked it over, spilling the coffee. The aide hurriedly drew his handkerchief, but Petlin stopped him. The damage was already done. No amount of wiping would ever clean the map.\n\nThe aide withdrew from the room, profusely apologizing all the while. As Petlin examined the stain, however, he remembered the rumors from the north, of a heretic amassing his forces to free the Siberians from the tyranny of fascism and communism.

He had to be careful not to press the paper too harshly against the tree bark, or he would tear the fragile and thin piece of grey paper apart. The notes themselves were simple, what he'd seen that day, the weather and geographical conditions, as well as the dispositions of the nearby locals.\n\nThe last part troubled Oleg more than any other. He did not like talking to people. He'd sooner crawl into the trenches of the enemy, evading mines and barbed wire, with machine guns raining fire upon him than talk to a bumpkin who couldn't even get their dialect right. Still, through the rugged surface, he managed to write a tiny bit of what he'd seen and heard of the locals. The data was probably insignificant, but he didn't care. He had done what was asked of him and done it brilliantly. He even talked to one or two of the less obnoxious farmers out there in the wilds. Finishing his writing, he shoved the paper into his pockets and sat down. It was time for a moment of rest. He took out a roughly rolled cigarette and lit it.\n\nIn the hands of the SIA, individual data was useless. Collectively, however, they might be the force that decided the battle. He dragged the cigarette out, letting the smoke cloud and cleanse his mind. After this, Oleg would go into the offices of the SIA and type up his report, drawing up conclusions and recommending courses of action for the higher-ups.

Occasionally they would come upon a bump on the road, and the four had to lift the blindfolded man back to his seat.\n\nTo their relief, the latter was silent. The voice that had proclaimed liberation for the workers of Russia from atop the radiowaves had held back, its will broken. He could do nothing now, his eyes shut, his hands tied behind his back - his followers lay dead in the fields, and whatever remained of his legacy would thaw like snow come the next spring.\n\nWhen they arrived at the clearing, a random spot in the middle of Russia designated as the "execution point." Opening the cargo bed, they took the blind man and brought him out by the elbow, setting him down, gently as they can, to a patch of snow-covered soil. Then, they made him stand and walked him forward, to somewhere he did not know. An atheist all his life, he confessed that he regretted nothing, and the calm stillness of the dawn greeted the eerie silence of his heart. He did not need the opiate of the masses; his pain was his own.\n\nThey took the blindfold off him, and the sunlight shocked him. How many days had it been? How many months, years - how much time? They stopped, and he knelt. His eyes remained fixated on the sky above.\n\nThey read out his sentence. Rifles clacked, and all ends pointed to his head. "By order of the Vozhd of the Russians," a voice read out loud, somewhere in front of him, "I sentence you, Valery Mikhailovich Sablin," he was ready. "To exile!"

The sun hadn't yet set, but it was best to be ready when it did. His pen scribbled on the creamy, expensive paper that the Vozhd had brought for him, a generosity that matched the grandiose scale of his commission: the history of Christianity in the Far East. With each stroke, he struck the thought and the memory of how he came under Mikhail Matkovsky's service, a story that he - and perhaps only he and God - knew. He gritted his teeth, vowing to carry the tale to his grave. Each man bore a different cross, and this was his: not to die in honor but to live in shame.\n\nHis pen halted upon reaching the Fifties and the Sixties. Here, he sighed. For the sake of posterity, perhaps the future would do better not knowing the crimes done to reach a better age. Aside from the general chaos of Russia, he found himself stumped. Other than the obvious and apparent, there were no notable events that had happened in the Far East. He would have to consult his archives, documents, and books. Perhaps there he would be able to forge a narrative convincing enough, real enough, that there would be none who would question it. He opened the first book, a baptismal record he had set on the table, and began reading, leafing through its pages to find and secure the desired truth.\n\nWithin the first few pages, the black bars started to appear. A certain Father, whose name was blotted out by thick, messy ink, had baptized hundreds in a village - the name blotted, struck out of living memory. Zakhar recognized his handiwork. He had to do it in a hurry. It had been a hard choice, but he could not let the integral history of the monastery disappear. Zakhar remembered the Father, a man who undertook the difficult mission of proselytizing to the tribes in the north. Nobody thought that he would return, yet he did - bringing not peace but the sword. Zakhar rode out with him to the south, an aide in his war council, from the beginning until the end.\n\nHe stepped outside, the weight of warm and bright memories twisted into darkness. The laughter, the tears, seemed to burn in his ears, a ringing sound that wouldn't cease. Then he saw the graves, their silhouettes dark against the dying sun. Rows upon rows, for miles upon miles. He saw the crosses of his comrades, men and women, that they bore in life, and that now they carry unto death. Crosses of rough-hewn wood, unmarked, and unnamed. He collapsed to his knees.

Dmitry nursed the stump that had once been his arm. He still felt it, at night, grasping at imaginary objects, gripping the handle of imagined doors, and brushing against walls that only belonged in his mind.\n\nIvan was out there, somewhere. The quiet bastard didn't even accept any form of thanks from him. A single grunt, and hands that shooed away any cigarettes, canned food, or money. Dmitry's prosthetic lay beside him, on the grass, its sockets yearning for an owner to wield them. Not now. It had been some time since the doctors amputated his gangrenous, infected arms in a dank, full medical tent. The morphine they provided had not been enough, and he still dreaded to think of the night.\n\nTurning to see the pile, he saw a guard in RFP uniform walk towards it carrying a can of petroleum. Others carried leaves, branches, and whatever flammable material they could find and smothered the pile with it. The heavy odor of petrol reeked as the guard first opened the can and then poured it on the papers, shuffling away from it, leaving a trail. Then he lit a match, and all of them watched as the fire caught the path fixed for it, and gently set the records ablaze.\n\nDmitry observed the flames burn with disinterest.

The Cabinet usually met during the day, not at night.\n\nOnce they were all seated, Matkovsky turned to him, mouthing, "That all of them?" He gave the Vozhd a nod, who then stood up and coughed, silencing the whispering that had commenced among the ministers. "Gentlemen," Matkovsky said, "I come to you here today with a bold proposal," he tapped his fingers on the table, going around the table, counter-clockwise. "As per the recommendations from our dear friend Nikolay Petlin," he pointed at Petlin as if his point needed clarification, "who has proposed a radical change: a change that would alter, perhaps the very nature of the party." Arriving at the other end of the table, he stopped, before continuing, "I understand that many of us here, including me, Petlin, Pavlov, and many others have served the cause of Russia ever since the creation of the party in Harbin." Striding forward, he raised his voice, "However, the times have changed. The Party needs to, forgive me for the trite expression, move on with the times."\n\nReturning to his seat, he said, "I propose to do away with the affectations of the past. To..." his voice trailed away, before once again finding purchase, "escape the shadow of Rodzaevsky." He raised his head and looked every man seated in their eyes one by one. "We shall sign the charter of Magadan. Petlin, our dear friend," his hands grasped Petlin's shoulders, "has kindly written a new constitution for us." He let go, before clapping his hands together, "I am sure that all of you have read it. Now, I propose, that from today henceforth the Russian Fascist Party is no more - it is now the National Labor Party of Russia." He paused, gauging every man there for their worth, "All in favor say aye."\n\nThere was no dissent."

Your Vozhd is calling you to a higher purpose! Though you may not have helped vanquish the false heirs to Harbin, you now have the opportunity to achieve a far greater glory: The reunification of our Russian land! Our friends in America have sent you the finest arms and equipment, but now we need you!"\n\nSergey pondered these words as he went downstairs to eat his breakfast. His parents had made him a simple kasha, and as he ate he could hear the truck driving by again.\n\n"Our victory over the traitors, subversives and lunatics is the first step towards a triumph over the Hun! With your help, we shall celebrate New Year's in Moscow! With your help, we shall celebrate Christmas in Kiev! And with your help, the world will stand in awe of Russia's majesty once more! Enlist with the National Republican Army today, and our Motherland will be united tomorrow!\n\nSergey knew his parents wouldn't approve, but after his breakfast he hurried to city hall to find the local recruiter.

Mikhail had painted over all of their troublesome antics with a single big, red brush. Yes, the far eastern reaches were secured, but it would not be enough.\n\nIt would never be enough. Magadan had been a poor home for the emigrees who had fled there, hoping for a new place. A new home. A new Russia. And now, a step had been taken towards this new dream. To think it was all coming within his grasp...\n\nOf course, he still had work to do. Control had to be solidifed, the Americans had to be sated, and the future had to be secured. But - his dream kept coming back to him. A free russia, different than all that had come before it. A new place, where everything was better. Everything was calmer. A place Russians could truly call home - no matter the price that would come in making it.\n\nA new, hopeful land. Peace through order; order through strength. This was the maxim they needed. Strong. Firm. Uncompromising.\n\nAnd despite all his glances to the forms on his desk, he couldn't get over the thoughts dancing in his head."

 magreg.3.desc:0 "Control information and you can sway the people, many say. What better way than to influence the radio? Several of Matkovsky's advisors have urged him to take a direct approach to the Radio Free Magadan, such as the Laborists who wish to use it for propaganda. Others such as the reformists wish for Radio Free Magadan to stay Free. The choice must be made soon, before someone may elect to make it themselves."

Mikhail strutted in accepting the greetings of a few Laborists, the glances of several Reformists, and - the silence of the room largely. It was quiet today. A small miracle - not having to deal with the bickerings of his own party. Nikolay Petlin came to the podium, and Mikhail waited to hear what was first on the agenda.\n\n"The first order of business on the agenda; the arrest of Mikhail Matkovsky." Nikolay stated calmly, with a single bit of iron to his tone.\n\nThe Vozhd froze, and then blinked. Had he heard that right? Arrest? Him? For a moment, he assumed it was a joke. A single bit of dry humor from a man who wanted his position. However, no one in the party protested. No one in the party laughed, or raised their voice. The Laborists he had greeted just minutes ago turned pale, and the room remained utterly silent.\n\n"For numerous crimes against both Russia, and the Russian people..." Nikolay continued, but Mikhail was no longer listening. How could this have happened? How did this happen? It wasn't possible. It wasn't. But as he stood there with a dumbfounded expression, shock written across his face, the guards moved. Not to arrest Petlin, or to shoot him on the spot.\n\n"Traitor." The former Vozhd whispered once quietly, as the guards moved to restrain him. "TRAITOR! YOU - BASTARD! You and your Reformers, every last one of you a bastard! You can't - " Arms wrapped around his own. Rage, fear, and sorrow compressed into a single scream.\n\nNone of his own clique look at him as he's dragged away. The guards ignore his pleas. And Nikolay Petlin, his spineless foreign minister, his subordinate, his replacement looks him in the eye the entire time he's dragged out."

 magreg.5.t:0 "The Tolling of the Bell"
 magreg.5.desc:0 "Petlin sat, metaphorically and physically, on the edge of his seat in a leather armchair in his study. He had already heard the doors slamming, the engines roaring like hellhounds off to drag him down to his final judgement, and the boots of soldiers slamming the ground as they made their way up his driveway. He knew what was coming, he had for weeks. Between the ominous looks from laborists, his allies disappearing, and the Vozhd's stranglehold growing ever tighter, Petlin knew a reckoning was coming. The death of any hope of freedom in Magadan was at hand. Yet, despite how much he had prepared himself mentally, the event still shook the man to his core.\n\nPetlin heard downstairs his door coming off its hinges unceremoniously as Matkovsky's thugs stormed his home. He stood up, awaiting the three armed men rushing up his staircase and into his study. As he raised his hands in a gesture of surrender, suddenly his breath was stolen from him as the primed-for-combat soldier at the front tackled him at the waist. Dizzy and in pain, Petlin was rolled onto his back and shackles were snapped onto his wrists as his charges were read out.\n\nTreason. A believable charge, an expected charge. It still stung to hear that all his efforts to improve his country had earned him the title of traitor.\n\nThe traitor was dragged out into the street. His neighbours stayed indoors so as to not incur the wrath of the Vozhd. Instead, they watched through their blinds as Petlin was thrown into the back of an unmarked truck. It sped off down the street, never to return to this place. Through his blistering headache, Petlin had only one thought."

Word from the sailors was that they were taken from the Kamchatkans, and would form the bud of Magadan's smuggling fleet. When he asked about the men they stole them from, one sailor callously described a brief firefight, but Abramov could see through his drunken state it was not as pleasant as he described.\n\nMatkovsky's forces may have lacked the aging Vozhd's legitimacy, but they were practical men and women; cutthroats. He thought back to his time with Rodzaevsky, watching as the RFP split and the old man ranted about Japanese help. Japanese?! No ture Russian would bow to a tea-drinking emperor who sat upon his silk pillows far away; the Revolution had proved that.\n\nTurning back to the shore, he saw the new banners of Matkovsky's RFP raised high, though as smugglers, such overt recognition would not help. He had a lot to teach these men, now that he was in charge of this frozen, murderous lot."

For as much as the people of Siberia are united in strength, all of Russia must be ours to defeat the German and Japanese imperialists!

 magreg.8.desc:0 "Diplomats from the Siberian National Republic have arrived in Washington in the last few days, meeting with officials from several agencies. Normally ambassadors from the states competing to reunify Russia are seeking diplomatic recognition, trade deals, or weapons, and usually all three. These men have come to America for a different purpose though. With the reunification of eastern Siberia, they report that the process of "stabilizing and rebuilding the Motherland" has begun. Citing this new stability and their long history of cooperation with the United States, they have requested permission to work with several Russian expat organizations in America. Their hope is to encourage Russian refugees and their families to emigrate back to Siberia and "heal the wounds the Nazis inflicted on the Russian people."\n\nNormally we would hesitate to allow representatives of a foreign government to work in the United States with the goal of persuading people to leave the country, but these are not normal circumstances. The Siberian National Republic, despite its authoritarian tendencies, has shown strong interest in aligning with the OFN, and if we play our cards right it could become a firm ally in a region of vital importance. The SNR has a strong opposition to Nazism and Communism, and while it would be easier to work with the Japanese they have instead courted us, and it would be unwise to ignore their overtures. In addition to all of this, the Russian emigre community in the United States is small and it is unlikely many will leave California or New York to return to Siberia. Those who do choose to go would likely return to their homeland either way.\n\nWith the downsides of accepting so far outweighed by the potential risks of rejecting the Russians, it has been decided that we should allow them in. We wish them luck on their mission. They'll need it to convince anyone to trade the greatest nation on earth for some arctic tundra."

He knew his daughter was only seven, and didn't understand the significance of what she'd just said, but she had just made his decision a certainty. He was Russian. His wife was Russian. His daughter had been born in Sacramento and had never been outside of the United States, but as far as he was concerned she was Russian too, and now she was saying Russians were stinky. Had some of the kids at school said that? Knowing their parents, it wouldn't have surprised Igor. They were just like everyone else in this country, always looking at him and Sofia with that uniquely American mix of pity and contempt. He was sick of it. When he'd heard about the Siberian Repatriation Program at the Russian Cultural Center last month it seemed like his prayers for a way out had finally been answered.\n\n"Why do we have to leave America?"\n\n"Because Russia is safe again sweetheart, and now we need to help make her strong again too."\n\n"But I like America.

It was miserably cold outside and the airport's insulation was far from perfect, but he still felt a warmth in his belly. It was the same warmth he felt when he met Sofia after arriving in San Francisco in the ancient year of 1947 or when he'd first held Sasha in his arms in the hospital in Sacramento. There was some indescribable joy in seeing all of the signs and labels written in Russian and confirming that he could still read his first language. Even hearing the chatter of all of the other people at the airport was an unexpected joy. The familiar words and syllables brought back so many memories of better times, before everything had gone south.\n\n"Papa?"\n\nSasha's question snapped Igor back to reality. "I'm sorry sweetheart, what did you say?"\n\n"Why can't we go to Vladivostok instead?"\n\n"Oh." He hesitated for just a moment. "The Japanese control it."\n\n"Darn." Sasha replied.

Every week a few more of those faces would arrive, presenting their passports and documents to customs workers who would wave them through an expedited arrival process. At first it was barely a trickle, but soon that trickle had grown into a stream and the stream into a flood of new immigrants arriving in Magadan, Kamchatka, and Irkutsk.\n\nFor most of these new arrivals this is an opportunity they have waited decades for, a chance to return to the homeland that was stolen from them decades ago. For others it is a chance to start over, to build a new life in a new nation where their past is only as important as they choose it to be. For a few it is a chance to see the Motherland they grew up hearing stories of but never dared visit themselves. With the warlords vanquished and order restored to the east, they can finally see the nation their families loved so dearly.\n\nWith the number of immigrants increasing by the day, more customs agents have been hired and the visa application process has been streamlined to reduce delaying arrivals and integration as much as possible. All across the globe the children of Mother Russia have heard the wonderful news: The nation is rebuilding, and the time for all Russians to do their duty has come at last. Every day more people arrive at our shores to answer the call to action, to build a new life, or even to retake an old one."

 magreg.12.desc:0 ""Are you sure this isn't some kind of trap? The Americans are asking you to come to them, halfway across the world, and you're not suspicious?" sputtered an aide, carrying Matkovsky's bags into the trunk of the car. "I cannot see how they will welcome you anymore than the Germans would!"\n\nMatkovsky sighed and dismissed the young man, explaining that the Americans, as secretive as they may be, would not be out for blood. The thought certainly lingered in his mind, but Mikhail had enough friends in the Russian neighborhoods across the United States to keep him hidden if need be.\n\nThis was a test of the Americans and their responsiveness. Before they had rarely considered working in the Russian anarchy, and a chance to secure the help of the OFN, even if they were corrupt oligarchs, would be a boon to his legitimacy. Some shipments of guns wouldn't hurt either.\n\nHe entered the car and watched the gray landscape pass by as his chauffeur worked down to the docks. Unfortunately, the journey would have to be by sea. The crew may have been manned by the most loyal members of the RFP, and the ship was the best one his smuggler fleet had, but it would still be a treacherous ride."

 magreg.13.t:0 "A Visit from the Vozhd"
 magreg.13.desc:0 "Washington's foreign policy bubble is abuzz in response to the news that the US has visitors: a delegation from the Siberian National Republic, a statelet which recently consolidated the easternmost lands of Russia under its control. The star of the show is the so-called "Vozhd", Mikahil Matkovsky, a leader whose cunning and drive are renowned in Russia expert circles. Matkovsky is controversial, however; his critics accuse him of running what is in effect a fascist dictatorship, antithetical to the idea that American foreign policy should seek to uphold democratic values. Less idealistic elements of the national security community point to Matkovsky's pragmatism and anti-Japanese sentiment to argue that the SNR could be a valuable ally, and perhaps one that the United States could influence for the better.\n\nThe Vozhd's visit, announced only shortly before his departure, is expected to last several days, with meeting the President being the high point of the affair. For Matkovsky and his men, long fighting for their lives in the frigid Far East, the Washington D.C high life may be a dream come true. For liberal politicians, it signals that their country's attachment to democratic values is far more tenuous than it appears, and several Republican and C-NPP congressmen have already made their objections clear.\n\nMatkovsky's goals are still unclear, but the consensus is that he seeks greater political and economic cooperation with the United States, possibly coupled with military aid. While some on the American side may be willing to hear him out, that fact is contingent on whether he is truly open to reforms, or just another despot ruling over the fallen remains of a great power."

One of the first stops for any erstwhile warlord on his world tour is the United States, and indeed, the Siberian National Republic's Nikolay Petlin is reportedly making his first state visit to Washington. Petlin's history has already made him popular among the American political class; he first took power by toppling the region's authoritarian strongman, Mikhail Matkovsky, and has promised to further democratic reforms as development continues.\n\nIn the Far East, with few inhabitants and fewer resources than it would like, foreign patronage is a vital political concern. Back at home, all eyes are on Petlin, as closer ties with the United States could greatly strengthen its chances of winning the grand Russian power struggle. Closer diplomatic and economic ties are likely the goal of this meeting, with the Holy Grail of military aid for farther off in the future.\n\nPetlin's chances look quite good; with the exception of a few dissenters who question how far the SNR has truly moved from fascism, most of Congress seems open to the idea of expanding relations, and the President has not signalled opposition. His few days in D.C. could mean the beginning of a mutually prosperous relationship — in the meantime, Petlin might take the opportunity to relax a bit in America's comparatively luxurious capital."

Even as the Vozhd, it was a struggle to find comfortable furniture. The phone conveniently sat on a table right next to him, and he decided to make use of the amenities. "Room service?" A short silence.\n\n"What do you need, Mr. Matkovsky?"\n\n"Give me rum." He thought for a moment. "Cuban."\n\n"That'll be right on its way, sir." A few minutes later, he reclined sipping a drink that had been the stuff of dreams just a few years ago. If Rodzaevsky wasn't dead, he would love to have seen his face. His thoughts turned to the day's events. Things had started off poorly; his welcome on the tarmac that morning was marred by the presence of a group of protestors, shouting all sorts of anti-fascist invective. They were lucky they hadn't met him at home. Mid-afternoon, once he was properly settled in, he met with the President for what turned out to be a very productive series of talks, where they discussed a number of topics ranging from the need for cooperation against Japanese aggression to the possibility of expanding economic ties in the future. To questions about political reform, Matkovsky made vague promises about democratization far off into the future, when the internal situation was more stable. The President was a reasonable person, and would naturally understand the delicacy of such matters. At least, that's what the Vozhd hoped.\n\nThe dinner was sumptuous, and Matkovsky very much enjoyed playing the part of the dignitary. He was particularly pleased to give a toast to a world without tyranny, earning substantial applause from those present. All in all, it had been a good enough showing for the Siberian National Republic's return to the world stage. He felt himself drifting off to sleep, and made one final mental note: find out where he could order a chair like this for his office at home."

Although initially put off by the Siberian National Republic's fascist past, the Americans ultimately decided that having an ally in the Siberian region outweighed other considerations. The recent delegation to Washington appears to have been a significant factor in assuaging their fears, and the President signed onto the deal with little opposition from the rest of the government.\n\nThe agreement between the US and SNR outlines significant political and economic cooperation, the expansion of trade between the two countries, a communication line between both countries' leadership, and a number of other provisions ensuring a firm working partnership for the years to come. Surrounded by rivals, such an opportunity could not have come sooner. Long isolated from the outside world, we finally have a lifeline, and one to a superpower to boot!

Despite a visit by an SNR delegation to Washington D.C., the Americans ultimately decided that closer cooperation was not in their interests, either because of the SNR's history as a derivative of the Russian Fascist Party or because they did not see the value of a client in the remote reaches of Siberia.\n\nWith this decision, our future in international affairs becomes substantially murkier. Perhaps the Americans can be persuaded to reconsider their offer when the SNR controls more of the Russian landmass, but for now we must be ready to fight for Russia's future alone. Without a major international patron, our foreign policy has been significantly weakened, with potentially dire consequences. In Magadan, where many people's hopes rode on further connections with the United States, the mood is grim, and many of our diplomats are undoubtedly being chewed out, or worse."

The Vozhd, noting the terms of the settlement, was reported to smirk and sit quite comfortably knowing he now has secured formal American support.\n\nBefore long, we expect to see the port stuffed with American vessels hauling tonnes of fuel, arms, supplies, and munitions so we may gain the upper hand against our adversaries in the east.

We are told in Siberia that the battles are tough and the winters are cold, but with American guns and fuel their troubles are sure to be few. With the signature of a document and the shake of a hand, a relationship between the United States and the Siberian National Republic has been cemented in law, and the future of our nations extends down the path of freedom against tyranny wherever it may be found."

Whether it is scrounging up what we can from the pillaged resources of our neighbors, or increasing the appeal of illegal shipping to the Port of Magadan, we must work tirelessly from the ground up.\n\nIn this Russia, crazed with pain, we are once again forced to resort to using smuggled goods and arms from Western and Japanese markets to prop up our republic. Faced by enemies from all sides, our failure to secure American support in our struggle against warlordism and the Siberian wilderness are telling of how truly alone we are in our fight for supremacy in this corner of the world.\n\nWith a firm resolve to improve our misfortune, the Vozhd turns his eyes to other markets, local and international, to attract the flow of arms and supplies to our domain. If we are to brave the brutality of the Eastern wastes, the Port of Magadan, our lifeline for our regime's governance over the region, must not run dry of foreign goods."

With a kick-started economy and an army fit to fight, the Siberian National Republic can stand on it's two feet and fight the chaos of anarchy with the support of her international allies.

With the exception of the occasional rocking smuggler vessel docked in the cold concrete harbor, the waters were empty of the ships from the Free World.\n\nOur cries for aid have been ignored by the 'freedom-loving' peoples of the West, and we are left with none to rely on but ourselves. Thus, we turn inwards, surviving on the limited supplies we can gather from across the wilderness of Siberia. If we are to persist even in the most bitter colds of the East, we must look inwards and find the resources necessary for the preservation of our young republic, lest we descend into icy conflict and warlordism once again."

While a loyal member of the RFP to the end, and a devoted supporter of Mikhail Matkovsky's fight to unify Russia from the anarchy that plagued it. But out in the forests along the rivers, he felt like the last man alive, a thought which frightened him to his core.\n\nHe stopped the truck on the overgrown trail, where a man greeted him in Russian. The Insurgent. The Rebel. His ally.\n\nDaniil assured the Russian he had brought the requested materials, opening the trunk to several wooden crates of grenades and small arms. If the Siberian National Republic provided the weapons for men like him, they'd make sure the Japanese soldiers in Siberia were busy with other matters besides Magadan's expansion.\n\nThe insurgent and his bodyguards looked exhausted, as if they had not slept a wink since the West Russian War. One of them poured out a flask into a set of glasses; locally made vodka he said. They toasted to a free Russia, a strong Russia, and a greater Russia."

From the coldest ports, all but cut off by impenetrable mountains and forests, we have stayed strong. Even when our ideals became corrupted by the old Rodzaevsky, and we moved even further from civilization.\n\nThe good and strong of the National Republic have led us to victory countless times, and will do so countless times more. We can establish ourselves now not as another among the chaff, but a true nation. Whether any other force in Russia can gain legitimacy against us is doubtful. So march forwards and reclaim Russia from the scourge of the Communists and German invaders!"

 magreg.25.t:0 "Down They Go"
 magreg.25.desc:0 "He paused for a second to get a better grip on his axe, his hands blistering from gripping the handle for most of the day. The work gang had cleared out a number of trees for constructing new houses in the villages far from Magadan. All part of Matkovsky's new program of "liberating labor": the Dalstroy.\n\nWith every swing embedding deep into the old larch trees, he thought about taking the axe to the overseer smoking a cigarette while clutching his pistol in the other hand. Another goon of the Vozhd's fascist pack. Could they not see his suffering, the suffering of the hundreds of dissidents and petty criminals doing the dirty work of Magadan? He may have had food and water, and the guards were not like the genocidal SS, but he was little more than a slave. Was this any different, he asked himself, than the serfs of the Tsars and the communal farmers of Bukharin?\n\nWith another set of blows from other laborers, the great tree fell, hurtling into the firm ground with a thud like cannon fire."
 magreg.25.a:0 "If only all of Sergey Soloyev's problems could be solved with a couple of axe blows."

 magreg.26.t:0 "Factionalism Rears its Head"
 magreg.26.desc:0 "The recent party congress has triggered a phenomenon previously unheard of in Magadan's halls of power: the formation of factions. As part of Matkovsky's token reforms to the political system, opportunities to express dissent within the National Labor Party have grown, and a number of politicians have decided to take advantage of these to attempt to change the government's course.\n\nMatkovsky's personal faction, the so-called Laborists, remain the largest bloc. An eclectic mix of moderate fascists, national conservatives, and personal loyalists to the Vozhd, this is the status quo wing of the party, advocating a very slow, moderated political reform under the umbrella of a single-party state. Even with the opposition more visible within the state apparatus, the Laborists hold nearly all of the power in practice, just the way that Matkovsky would like it.\n\nIn many ways, reform only generates more appetite for reform, and this certainly applies in Siberia just as anywhere else. Protesting single-party rule, Nikolay Petlin has formed his own reformist wing of the party, one composed of advocates for a genuinely democratic system. Matkovsky's interest in political change only goes so far; his distrust for Petlin is well known, and the reformists can be expected to be an underrepresented if loud section of the party.\n\nBringing up the rear is the Old Guard, a practically vestigial wing of the party led by fascist hardliners. As there is practically no desire for a Rodzaevsky-style return to extremist ideals among the populace or the political class, the hardliners are isolated and powerless, mostly made up of obscure, ineffectual figures. Many speculate that they are kept around as merely a negative comparison to Matkovsky's "moderate" rule, and scapegoats for his worst decisions.\n\nThis new era signals unprecedented pluralism as well as unprecedented conflict within the party. Only time will tell if the SNR is significantly impacted by the decision."
 magreg.26.a:0 "New rifts reveal themselves."
 
 magreg.27.t:0 "The Grand Sobor"
 magreg.27.desc:0 "Within his office in Magadan, Nikolay Petlin allowed himself a small smile. For the first time in years he could reasonably say that he was hopeful for the future. After months of careful maneuvering he had convinced Matkovsky to allow a primitive legislative body to be formed. The Grand Sobor was barely worth the name, but it was a start.\n\nThe Vozhd was still the ultimate power in Magadan, as he was not about to give up more than token influence over the nation. In fact, getting Matkovsky to relinquish even what little power that was given to the sobor was almost miraculous in and of itself, but even so a victory had been scored for the people of Russia, as minor as it was.\n\nIt was clear to Petlin that Matkovsky thought the matter closed, that the token reforms he had allowed would be the end of the discussion. He believed he could simply go back to closing his mailed fist ever tighter around the Russian people, but Nikolay knew in his heart that he had only just begun. The Russian people had suffered for so long and they deserve so much more than a council that would rubber-stamp Vozhd Matkovsky 's decrees. It would be difficult, and very dangerous, but he would do all he could to bring about a Russia that its people could be proud of."
 magreg.27.a:0 "The one step at a time."
 
 magreg.28.t:0 "By the Will of the Vozhd"
 magreg.28.desc:0 "It appears that the party congress was the last vaguely democratic breath of Magadan, as today the Vozhd has quelled any shred of a doubt that there will be a council or congress. The power is his and his alone. Officials among the Reformists grow deeply worried, and so too have the Labourists. Not out of fear that the Vozhd has overstepped his bounds, but instead that Petlin and his compatriots would see the blatant seizure of power as a direct attack on their goals and they would begin undermining the party."

 magreg.31.t:0 "A Brief Glimpse of Daylight"
 magreg.31.desc:0 "Nikolay Petlin scraped his fork across the plate for about the fifth time since the last bit of meat had been picked clean. Embroiled in thought, he continued to swirl the bits of sauce and grease that remained as his mind wandered. The taint of fascism was running deeper and deeper in Magadan with every passing day, stretching its tendrils across his fair country and tightening its grip. There was an anger there, for sure, but there was also optimism coupled with the tug of despair. It was his duty to rid what was once a protective measure, now a vile curse, from Harbin and Russia at large. Just as he was about to scrape the plate once again, he heard his wife pipe up from across the table.\n\n"It will work out. I have faith in you." Spoke Lydia, already knowing what was tearing at her husband. It haunted her too, in fact. Every facet of Magadan reeked of the RFP and, by extension, her late ex-husband Rodzaevsky.\n\n"Will it? There is so much work to be done, Lydia. Matkovsky rules like a butcher and every day it seems like freedom gets further away and fascism gets stronger." Replied Nikolay.\n\n"Someone has to do it, Nikolay. Gladly, that person is you, but you don't have to do it alone. I know these types, hell I was married to one. They're strongmen. Matkovsky is a man who rules by fear and brutality. A force of freedom will always topple a paper tiger like him."\n\n"Thank you." Nodded Nikolay. The burden was not entirely eased, but at least he had some measure of reassurance. But moreso, he simply wanted out of the conversation. So, with a stiff upper lip he picked up his plate and placed it in the sink before heading off to his study, his mind abuzz with the same witch's brew of emotions."
 magreg.31.a:0 "A drop of hope still goes a long way, though."

 magreg.32.t:0 "A New Beginning"
 magreg.32.desc:0 "For Nikolay Petlin, the last few days had been a whirlwind of confusion and danger. The tyrant Matkovsky was in chains, arrested in a moment of weakness by a man he had thought so below him to be more a bug than a man. Petlin's supporters held the former Vozhd in a secure cell within Magadan, under close guard. It was almost enough to make him laugh, the sheer luck that had been necessary for the success of the coup boggled the mind.\n\nHis co-conspirators had risked it all to overthrow the Tyrant, and had Matkovsky been, ironically, more like his hated rival Rodzaevsky he would have likely ended Petlin's rebellion before it had begun. Thankfully, his arrogance had blinded him to the threat brewing under his nose. Now, a similar trouble brewed even as he sat overlooking the city.\n\nIn the depths of his new office, Petlin found himself in a very precarious position. While Matkovsky was safely behind bars, support for the Tyrant of Magadan was high in the army and the Security Service. It would be a perilous task in and of itself to prevent Matkovsky's supporters from retaking control of the government, but it would be a necessary one. For the people of Russia to prosper, Matkovsky's tyranny needs to be left in the dustbin of history."
 magreg.32.a:0 "We can finally begin the great work."

 magreg.33.t:0 "Last Gasp of Freedom"
 magreg.33.desc:0 "Something is occurring in Magadan. The citizens ignore it, trying their best to go about their daily business like these people never existed while the politicians fight over it in hushed whispers of backrooms. People are disappearing left and right, picked out of their homes in the night and rushed off to Laborist prison camps. Noticeably, most of them have been reformists. Only the Vozhd truly knows what's going on. Petlin was inches away from undermining his power, but Matkovsky had been too arrogant to acknowledge the threat.\n\nAs seen by the recent arrests, however, this will not happen again under the Vozhd's watch. Stability is the key to preserving power, and if that takes a purge, so be it."
 magreg.33.a:0 "None will be spared."

 magreg.34.t:0 "Petlin at Sea"
 magreg.34.desc:0 "Nikolay Petlin was never a fan of sea travel. The sheer emptiness of the ocean made even the Siberian forests feel comforting. But this journey was too important to waste fearing a watery grave. Petlin was to go to America for business.\n\nGathering up the contents of the briefcase, he looked forward to the mission. The Siberian National Republic needed American aid if it was to be anything more than another warlord in the mix. Considering how Rodzaevsky was moving to do the same with the Japanese, it would more likely turn Washington to his side.\n\nHe headed down the ship into his quarters; comfortable by warship standards, but not by much else. The engines began to whir as he, his aides, and his ship, set off to the West Coast."

 petlin.1.t:0 "The New Republic"
 petlin.1.desc:0 "Petlin adjusted his glasses as he entered Matkovsky's office, in the old RFP headquarters in Magadan. The place definitely seemed lived in. Shot-glasses with neat whiskey in them, and bottles of vodka just gathering dust littered the desk where the former Vozhd had once sat. Matkovsky likely knew that he was being arrested, and prepared himself accordingly. Petlin just did not expect him to indulge in alcohol, in the twilight hours of his political career. Outside, the wind howled, pounding the window-panes with savage force. Petlin wanted to shiver, but he was not cold.\n\nHe remembered the sight of Matkovsky as the guards hauled him away to prison, awaiting trial. A pale face, a pair of bloodshot eyes, and a face that screamed utter defeat. Once, he had believed that Matkovsky was somewhat of a good man: standing up against the blackshirts and the savage barbarity that was commonplace in Harbin were virtuous deeds. When Petlin proposed the Siberian Bill of Rights, the old Vozhd seemed excited at the prospect of a renewed gesture at political reform. However, right in this office, a few years ago, he remembered as Matkovsky tore at his bill, decrying his ideals as "too liberal." Then came the Dalstroy scandal. Matkovsky was a monster all along.\n\n"No more Harbin," Petlin said, to Matkovsky. "No more the atrocities, no more the ideologies that debase us to the level of beasts." He strode to Matkovsky's favorite gramophone and turned it on. March of Siberian Riflemen filled the air. He picked up an empty shot glass and toasted to comrades long gone."
 petlin.1.a:0 ""To the memories of Harbin.""

 petlin.2.t:0 "Hope for Siberia?"
 petlin.2.desc:0 "Promising reports have reached the CIA from our contacts in the Siberian National Republic. A new government has usurped power from Mikhail Matkovsky's regime, and seems to bear all the signs of a functioning democracy in the making. This new government, headed by one Nikolay Petlin, also seems quite interested in strengthening ties with the US. Requests of that nature from Petlin's government have already reached the State Department, and await our response."
 petlin.2.a:0 "We could always use new friends."

 petlin.3.t:0 "Word from Washington"
 petlin.3.desc:0 "It seems our efforts to strengthen ties with the United States have borne fruit. Our foreign office has received word from American diplomats that they are interested in increasing economic and diplomatic relations between our two nations. All that remains now is to sort out the details, but that shouldn't be too much of a challenge for the Foreign Ministry. This could be the start of a beautiful relationship indeed!"
 petlin.3.a:0 "Wonderful."

 petlin.4.t:0 "Exorcising the Shadow"
 petlin.4.desc:0 ""This is ridiculous, Petlin!" Alexander Pavlov said to him in his office, "the Voz- Matkovsky might have been a criminal, but to abolish his title is a betrayal to our cause." Pavlov sighed. "Let's walk back on this, Petlin, my friend. We must safeguard the legacy of our predecessors. Matkovsky was a good man, and without him, the party would not have reached Siberia. He was a criminal, yes, but all he did, he did for the glory of his motherland."\n\n"I believe you, Pavlov," Petlin replied, his voice calm. "However, comrade, without Matkovsky the Dalstroy would not exist as an entity. The papers," Petlin was exasperated. "The papers in the Irkutsk Presidium. Remember that? The paper trails he'd burnt to cover his trace. The Soviets might not be our allies but their insight is important. Matkovsky is a criminal, and I will see him tried. No trace of his influence shall remain in this - in my - party. I hope you understand."\n\n"Fine. if you would not recognize his existence, then I will not recognize your government." He pointed at Petlin. "Listen, Petlin. I never liked you much in the old days, but now, there is no reason to hold back. You are not my Vozhd, Nikolay Petlin, and I will make sure the Laborists know that. The SIA, too." He stormed out the door.\n\nPetlin was tempted to call out to him, using the American expression. What was it again?"
 petlin.4.a:0 ""Don't let the door hit your ass on your way out.""

 petlin.5.t:0 "Criminals No Longer"
 petlin.5.desc:0 "The bare feeling of legs without shackles was new to Ivanov. The Dalstroy had put him to work digging railways and pointless public works for his association with the NKVD. He toiled, day and night, under starvation rations, sure that he would collapse at any given moment. His body was weak, and the work certainly did him no favors. Ivanov looked at his shoulders and arms. Boney, without much substance nor muscle. The soup they ladled out, thin and unappetizing, did not provide for much sustenance.\n\nThen, armed guards of the Siberian National Republic strode into the camp, arresting everyone. Some of the wardens ran to the woods, after a gunfight with the army. Ivanov heard that the rogue guards had been detained, awaiting trial, same as with their Vozhd. The act startled him. Justice in the depths of the Russian Far East was not unlikely; it was impossible. Yet, there he was, the soldiers casting off his shackles and delivered him away from that hell.\n\nNow, his only concern was that he needed a job. However, surely, President Petlin and his Prime Minister would take care of that. No more shadows, no more domination by powers that only sought power."
 petlin.5.a:0 "Only Justice."

 petlin.6.t:0 "Memories of Harbin"
 petlin.6.desc:0 "The scene was perhaps familiar. Petlin remembered the evenings and nights in Harbin, as the Russian Fascist Party celebrated its zenith. The swastika, the hooked cross ran through by electrified lights, shone like a Christmas tree in the freezing winds of Harbin winters. Yet, they stood, neither fire nor flames warming their hearts, but through the strength of will alone. Love, too.\n\nLove, the strongest of all emotions. It was love that brought them into Russia again. It was love that made them think of Russia when the Japanese and Chinese ignored and discriminated against them. Yet, it was love that also begat Rodzaevsky's obsession with a pure Russia, that justified the Dalstroy's atrocities. As Petlin and the people of Magadan held the candles in the remembrance of such tragedies and feats of will, they closed their eyes and prayed. A choir song soft hymns to God, of forgiveness and repentance. Petlin closed his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his own past. An organizer, of voices that once spoke of him with warmth and looked out for him. Of Matkovsky, of Rodzaevsky - they were young then, and all so foolish. So, so foolish. When he opened them, the patriarch led the flock through the Lord's prayer. Petlin followed."
 petlin.6.a:0 ""And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.""

 petlin.7.t:0 "Goodbyes"
 petlin.7.desc:0 ""Well, Lydia," Petlin said, at the entrance hall to his house, addressing his wife. "I'm off, and maybe for some time. It's going to be a few days, weeks, I don't know. I promise you that I'll be back soon." He regarded his wife with a broad smile on his face. Petlin was proud of her. A dissident in her own right, a powerful and active woman, freed from the clutches of Rodzaevsky the madman. He shuddered to think of what the deranged Vozhd had done to her, but she did not tell of her days in Harbin much.\n\n"See you, dear." Lydia said as she corrected her husband's tie. "Where are you going again? I have been on Magadan for so long that I don't know much about Russia."\n\n"Novosibirsk. The city of the Sun, as they call it, dear. I know that I will be far from you, but this is necessary. Soon, you will leave Magadan, and we shall go westwards. The state cannot hold a government from such a remote position such as Magadan."\n\n"I liked it here, at least."\n\n"I know. We will return here someday when Russia is whole again. Perhaps we'll even cross the straits, into America. See Los Angeles, San Francisco! Maybe even Vegas."\n\nShe smiled, a twinkle of enthusiasm in her eyes."
 petlin.7.a:0 ""It's a promise, dear.""

 petlin.8.t:0 "The Assembly of Novosibirsk"
 petlin.8.desc:0 "The conference at Novosibirsk took place behind closed doors, within the old halls of the city's local presidium. Whatever media that Russia had, as well as some foreign outlets from America, trailed the proceedings. All deputies of the Russian National Party refused to comment. Petlin hurried away on his car before the reporters could reach him, bodyguards shoving the crowds away from him. Whatever that could be gleaned from the discussions within seemed to speak in favor of reformism, although no one knew its details.\n\nFinally, on one crisp morning, Petlin stepped out on a podium, the rest of the Russian National Party behind him. "People of Russia and Siberia," he began, gathering his strength to address a nation. Or half of it. "I stand before you today, the leader of the Siberian National Republic, its president by the will of arms." He paused. "But that will be no longer. I declare thusly: that political parties are now legal, that the government will now seek approval from its people. We dedicate ourselves to the restoration of a democratic, and republican Russia." All eyes were on him. "That is all."\n\nCheering broke out as he turned his back to face his party. In the middle of cold Siberia was a small spring of warmth. The media did not know of it, but Petlin smiled at their enthusiasm."
 petlin.8.a:0 "The Siberian thaw has begun."

 petlin.9.t:0 "The Siberian Constitution"
 petlin.9.desc:0 "After his declaration at the end of the Assembly of Novosibirsk, Petlin had gathered independents, laborists, and his own wing of the party together to discuss the specifics of a new constitution to replace the old Bill of Rights. In this, Petlin added provisions that defended the rights of free speech, assembly, and the right to organize politically. The laborists grumbled and complained, but they did not have sole power on the party anymore. The independents, at first wary of Matkovsky, soon warmed up to him. Finally, after years of dictatorial rule, a leader who would listen to their concerns.\n\nStanding in the halls of the Novosibirsk Assembly, Petlin remained the previous years, standing before Matkovsky as the presented his idea of a Bill of Rights before the Vozhd. "Too liberal." The words came back to him. "I am suspecting that you are a socialist, Petlin." He gave a chuckle. How was he so weak? If the same Vozhd returned to him, clad in his full glory, Petlin would not submit. The peoples of Russia have their rights, and he shall not deny them their entitlement. He swore that no one shall experience what had happened in Harbin, ever again.\n\nA couple of Siberian deputies approached him, hammer-and-sickle pins on their suits. Petlin became weary, but then they invited him to dinner. He smiled. Perhaps the communists are not as bad as they say, after all."
 petlin.9.a:0 "A new democracy is born."

 petlin.10.t:0 "Enemy, Mentor, Protégé, President"
 petlin.10.desc:0 ""Do you visit me just to gloat, Petlin?" Matkovsky shot him a venomous look. "When I am dying, you come to me. Foreign Minister, Deputy, protégé, but above all, a traitor to our ideals. A traitor to Harbin!" Matkovsky rose from his bed but collapsed right back into it. When Petlin moved to help him, he held his hand out. "I do not need a traitor's help." He coughed blood. "I am close to dying, and I see my vision for Russia burning before my eyes. Its arsonist stands before me, yet I can do nothing."\n\n"Matkovsky," the name sounded strange on Petlin's tongue. "Would those that stand for the memories of Harbin let the pressure heaved upon us against our own people? If a decent man sees the Dalstroy and condemns it not, would it make him true to the memories of labor in Harbin, where women sold themselves on the streets, out of desperation? Tell me that," he held his breath. "Vozhd of all Russians."\n\n"You have no right to address me as such! You lowly worm, lowest of the low. To say that I despise you would be an understatement, Petlin."\n\n"The feeling is mutual, Matkovsky." They stared at each other, too angry to continue the conversation. "Trust me with Russia. I will take care of her well."\n\nA light of sympathy burned in Matkovsky's eyes. "Perhaps. Petlin, if you do not succeed. I will torment you in Hell. Remember that. Now, leave me, Mr. President.""
 petlin.10.a:0 "Mentor and protégé reconciled within one common wish."

 #Matkovsky
 matkovsky.1.t:0 "A New, Winter Dawn"
 matkovsky.1.desc:0 "Matkovsky had been here before, in the misty days where Magadan constituted his only territory. His office was cleaner, his vodka more expensive, and the stationary both more reliable and better to grip. Yet, the old Harbin feeling never left him. He looked at the window, seeing petals of snow unfurl and split in mid-air, the howling of the winter winds dying against the glass-panes. Some flakes stuck, but they slid down, leaving a trail of clear liquid behind them.\n\nHe turned his attention to the list. Sheets upon sheets of names, blotted out in the order of their execution. At the top of the list was his enemy: Nikolai Petlin. The name was crossed out, but in truth, Matkovsky did not know where he went. Still, it was preferable to keep his absence in a more permanent state. Nikolai Petlin was dead, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAides came and went by his room, carrying a chill with them, shivering as they handed out reports of the purge to the Vozhd. "Hey," Matkovsky said to a lanky, blond aide. "Turn that gramophone on." The roar of music and the howl of the winds masked the gunshots, out in the Siberian wilds."
 matkovsky.1.a:0 "A Vozhd's work never ceases."
 
 matkovsky.2.t:0 "A Siberian Bill, Renewed"
 matkovsky.2.desc:0 "Once upon a time, the Vozhd of the Russians entrusted his loyal follower to write a constitution for him. The minister in charge was Nikolai Petlin: the traitor, the man responsible for the poisonous current of liberalism that ran in the Vozhd's party. His venom corroded Matkovsky's hold, like venom hissing upon contact with steel. The Vozhd was a merciful man, full of lenience. Yet, he could never let this sort of thing occur ever again. Not the least when he was this close to power.\n\nSo, he would have to be strict. He had entrusted the Russian before with the powers of political liberties and free speech, yet, they betrayed him. Tonight, by himself and a candle-lit room, Matkovsky would bind together a Siberian Bill of Rights. A new one, with none of the flaws of the old. He had to. If the Russian people and dissidents of the party would defy him, he found no better alternative than self-defense.\n\nHe would start by cutting. The former Bill of Rights was too long, too wordy, too ponderous. It spent a lot of its length clarifying useless liberties that could threaten the party's position. Matkovsky did away with them striking provision after provision with slashes from his pen.\n\nWhen morning light spilled from the windows to his desk, he rose, a new Bill in his hand. The Vozhd smiled, his work done."
 matkovsky.2.a:0 "Never shall the mistake be repeated."
 
 matkovsky.3.t:0 "Voter Rolls"
 matkovsky.3.desc:0 "When his village announced the new voting rolls for his district, Aysen was excited. Perhaps the Vozhd of the Russians would not be the leader of Russians alone. Yet, he, with the rest of the Sakha people living there, found their names absent from the board. Aysen's eyes looked over the A section, over and over again, sure that there was a mistake. It was blank as if the local officials had skipped over him.\n\nSo, this day, he came to the offices of the electoral commission, seeking to complain. Aysen was rightfully a citizen of the state, and he would not see his rights violated. Inside the log-built wooden building was a burly man who attended a thin slab of plank for a table. Two guards, armed with rifles and pistols, stood on the opposite corners of the room. A door was at the back, leading further into the innards of the office. Approaching the man, Aysen said, "Sir, I am sorry for interrupting your work, but my name is not on the voting roll."\n\nThe man smirked. "Are you Yakut?" he said. Aysen nodded. "My, my." He barked at the guard in Russian, who went to the backs of the office and summoned a paper form, composed of five to six sheets. "Fill this form and do the test. I will decide if you can vote."\n\nAysen spoke Russian, but not this kind of Russian. Scientific nomenclatures, technical terms, so many things he could not understand. The form was a literacy test, he realized. A way to cheat the Sakha people from their right to vote. Still, he filled the form with every ounce of knowledge in his mind and handed it to the man.\n\nAn affected disappointment. "I am sorry, but you can't. Perhaps once you've studied a bit more, you would be able to do so. However, as it stands, I can see nothing good coming out of you voting." A smile. "No offense." Aysen left the office fuming, but also frustrated."
 matkovsky.3.a:0 "The Party needs competent voters."
 
 matkovsky.4.t:0 "Status Report"
 matkovsky.4.desc:0 "A report was thrown on Matkovsky's desk from the State Intelligence Agency, spilling out sheets of paper and dossiers filled with printed reports and graphs. On its cover, it read 'THE SITUATION IN THE WEST' - gathered intelligence providing a comprehensive oversight of the warlords and bandit republics clashing in Central Siberia. The Vozhd gave the papers a long and skeptical stare, before reaching over and carefully flicking through each page.\n\nHe scoured over each sheet, examining the details of every bolshevik briggand and opportunist despot rampaging throughout the icy region. Like animals, they skirmished with each other for scraps of food and resources in the frozen plains to the west. Finally, the Vozhd came to a page detailing various strategic and logistical plans for a possible annexation and integration of the region, and his eyes began to glow.\n\nHis authoritarian ego nourished, Matkovsky smirked and tossed the document back on his wooden desk. He leaned back in his chair and reflected upon the proposal, exciting his senses with all kinds of plans to march westwards."

 matkovsky.5.t:0 "In the Interests of National Security"
 matkovsky.5.desc:0 "The Vozhd, upon realising control over much of Eastern Siberia, has returned his attention to matters of state security. After all, in order to have a stable republic, he explains, it must be protected from within and without. Thus, it has been determined that the State Intelligence Agency is to have far greater autonomy from legal restrictions and the authority to conduct operations that will safeguard our nation against subversives and revolutionaries.\n\nDoors are kicked down, homes are raided, hundreds are arrested, and traitors are shot. In the name of national security, there can be no margin of error. The Vozhd cannot afford to let this young republic, this great hope for Russia, fall to seditious villainy from the dark corners of the eastern wastes. The siberian wilderness is unforgiving, and for the crime of treason, Matkovsky is too."

 matkovsky.6.t:0 "Fair Elections"
 matkovsky.6.desc:0 "There were three names on the ballot for the Tomsk-12 constituency. Two were the candidates of the Russian National Labor Party, who had all the support the party could give them. Time in the local radio, campaigning funds, and the posters with their names that stuck on seemingly every window-corner of a Tomsk street. The Peace Preservation Act had mandated strict ideological requirements for political parties, effectively disqualifying any of the Tomsk Salons from running.\n\nThe other candidate was an independent, a former Bastillard. He entered the elections knowing full well that he was at a disadvantage. None of the old Salons could help him. Radios and newspapers refused to give him interviews. He had some discreet money funneled through by his old pals in the Bastillards, but that itself was a dangerous proposition. Should the authorities discover them, he would be charged with fraud and disqualified from the election. So he did what he did in his Bastillard days: standing on street-corners trying to insult people enough to pay attention to him. Some days, he could have a conversation. Others, the police hauled him away, naming him a "public pest."\n\nWhen the votes were tallied at the end of the day, the result was unsurprising. Ninety-five percent voted for the RNLP candidates, the rest going to the independent."

 matkovsky.7.t:0 "Volunteer Work"
 matkovsky.7.desc:0 "After the primaries, Alyosha spent his days milling about the town of Amur, doing odd-jobs and nothing in particular. He had spent a fortune to enter the Russian National Labor Party, only to be defeated in the primaries. Alyosha's politics were liberal: he had hoped to join the RNLP with the express purpose of reforming it from within. Now, bereft of money and opportunities, his days went by too slowly but also too quickly, like candles.\n\nIt didn't take too long for the SIA to find Alyosha. He was not a discreet man, and his behavior had attracted attention. Just as he entered a bar to drink his worries away, two men, one thin and tall, one stocky and beefy, tapped him on the shoulder. "Mr. Alyosha?" they said, "Could you please come with us? We are from the party. We need to talk."\n\nAt first, Alyosha was hopeful. Maybe the Vozhd saw potential in him as a politician and had sent these two men to give him a second chance. However, his flights of fancy were brought down by the weight of gravity when he realized that these two men were probably from the SIA.\n\nTaking him to a quiet street corner, they interrogated Alyosha on his faith for the Russian people, before asking him to volunteer in the Dalstroy. His face paled, but he had little choice. "Yes," he said. "Yes.""

 matkovsky.8.t:0 "Concessions from the Vozhd"
 matkovsky.8.desc:0 ""Phoning-in this morning, we have received firm assurance from Mikhail Matkovsky, the Vozhd of the Siberian National Republic, that efforts towards the strengthening of their free republic have recently undergone significant improvement. We have insisted in the past that if they want to hear anything from the United States, they too must show their dedication to the rights of men, to which they have appropriately adjusted and committed themselves to.\n\nMatkovsky presented evidence to suggest that the treatment of minority groups has improved from the Russian ruling establishment. Moreover, we are assured that liberties guaranteed in law have been respected by the state and law enforcement across the nation. Indeed, our own few diplomats across the Pacific have given us the thumbs up after being taken on a tour of Siberia by dozens of state officials to see the great potential of the region, not giving us a single tip for anything worthy of criticism in the young republic.\n\nMatkosvky was slow in his replies when we questioned him, but we have faith he will follow through on his promises. Until then, we will continue our diplomatic missions to discover more about the mysterious eastern republic now cozying up to us."

 matkovsky.9.t:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
 matkovsky.9.desc:0 """AND HALT!"\n\nThe ranks of Siberian Rangers stopped their march, and a great crash echoed throughout the encampment as the soldiers stamped their boots. They stood in regimented columns, upright in rows and awaiting Captain Oleg's next command. These were the new recruits and they had been undergoing viscous training in the wilderness of Siberia to acclimatize them to the bitter eastern chill. Training was harsh, and the officers harsher, but such strict order could carve these men into warriors worthy of the Vozhd's command.\n\nResisting the harsh Siberian cold, they stood still as Captain Oleg walked past and examined each recruit. He looked at each one of the men in the eye and studied their posture. His gaze was piercing and intimidating, his very stare disciplining any sense of disloyalty in the young men's hearts. Captain Oleg reached the end of the column, to which he raised his hand for a moment and the recruits lifted their rifles to their side in synchrony. With his back turned to the recruits, the collective clatter of the rifles reminded Captain Oleg of his early days in the military, and he gazed back at the men to notice they were far more skilled than he was. He smiled beneath his bushy mustache and chuckled for a moment, before returning to his cold and unforgiving gaze."

 matkovsky.10.t:0 "Grim Tidings"
 matkovsky.10.desc:0 "Matkovsky sat in his office, drinking wine. Finally, after all these years, a vintage worth its legacy. Warm, sweet, it made Matkovsky tipsy and slightly drunk. The gramophone from Harbin sat in the corner of the room, blaring nostalgic songs: patriotic marches, anthems, Tchaikovsky. The sweet tunes and melodies of his youth brought back memories of him as a teenage boy in the Paris of the East. Finally, all that suffering, all that pain, was worth it.\n\nA knocking on the door, a disturbance to the rhythm. His doctor came through the door, lathered in an icy sweat. His glasses seemed to tremble as he walked forward, his eyes averted from Matkovsky's face. "S-sir," he said, stammering, fear apparent in the crashing of his teeth, "I-I bring you bad news."\n\nLeanig back on his grandiose chair, Matkovsky spoke. "What kind of bad news, doctor? Can't you see that the Vozhd is having a good time? Can't it wait? Surely you do not dare risk my wrath."\n\n"N-no, sir. It absolutely cannot." Swallowing, he continued. "I am afraid you are afflicted with cancer, sir."\n\nFor a moment Matkovsky sat still. He could not believe what had traveled through the doctor's lips. Cancer? Him? At the peak of his life, at this very moment? Lies! Lies! He stood up, calmly, wine glass in hand. Matkovsky jerked his arm back and forward again, catapulting the glass into the doctor's suit, splattering him in red. He wanted to shout, to scream, but he had to be calm.\n\n"Guards! Guards! Take this man away from me!" Boots trampled into the room. "Volunteer him for Dalstroy work. Make sure he is thoroughly educated. Understand?" Nods. "Dismissed." They carried the doctor out, and sobbing trailed after their departure."
