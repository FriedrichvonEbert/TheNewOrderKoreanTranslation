 NIK_gcoup_gumilyovs_coup_desc:0 "With a little bit of luck, and a whole bunch of violence, Ivan Serov and his most loyal supporters now occupy the offices of government in the capital of the republic. The coup was executed flawlessly, with those who attempted to resist readily dealt with, and the most immediate dangers of a countercoup prevented. However, that being said, there is a significant amount of work ahead of us if we are to ensure that our government's power is cemented in Syktyvkar and beyond. We must take steps to pacify the capital, court both our political and civilian allies, among them Taboritsky and the urban workers, as well as smash the Komi left and prevent it from organizing a resistance to our new order. Right now, every minute - no, every second - matters to ensure that our administration is able to extend itself over the entirety of our territory."
 NIK_gcoup_shut_down_the_stagnant_desc:0 "If Serov and his followers are aware of anything, it's the danger posed by Mikhail Suslov and his loyal, fanatical bands of pro-Soviet leftists. For the past few months, if not years, Suslov has regularly ordered political assassinations and street violence from his bands and militias, and they have carried out, without question, every letter of his orders. As such, we can no longer trust the Komi left to sit by "idly" as we solidify our rule; they are surely plotting our demise. Suslov's deviousness, however, is not matched by his political posturing. The stagnant form of socialism preached by the left is far from a convincing path for the Russian people's future. As such, we must make sure that they never come to power. A combination of force and propaganda will ensure that we isolate them and their most fanatical ideologues from the rest of their supporters."
 NIK_gcoup_absorb_belozerov_desc:0 "The Komi left is nothing if not vicious. Caught up in the atmosphere of political chaos and instability, Suslov has become an incredibly ironclad figure, ordering political assassinations and contributing to the chaos in the streets. While Suslov and his attack dogs have had the right as their primary targets ever since the formation of the republic, that doesn't mean that we can't learn from them. In fact, we should ensure that we integrate a number of their tactics for political intimidation and violence, ensuring that our militias and those who command them are well-equipped to deal not just with the leftists, but with the democratic center as well. Right now, at the crucial moment, we should make sure that our competition, vehemently opposed to our Ordosocialism, is not in any position to protest the radical changes that we have planned."
 NIK_gcoup_align_taboritsky_desc:0 "Taboritsky has always been a wildcard in Syktyvkar's right-wing political scene. Regardless, it's no secret that he has a fairly sizable following which could be used to our advantage. However, it's likely that we would have to compromise with the man to ensure that we can win him over to our side.\n\nTaboritsky, despite his dubious character, would be an invaluable tool to preserve our new order in these chaotic times, especially with the amount of power he wields over the militias as a popular figure in their ranks. By aligning his goals with ours, we will be able to ensure not only that we gain a powerful ally, but deflect a potential enemy, at least for now."
 NIK_gcoup_appeal_to_the_clergy_desc:0 "Despite what Suslov and his leftist lackeys may claim, we are, after all, socialists. And who, if not the workers, do we serve? A number of individuals within our party have suggested that we play to our strengths to weaken our enemies and solidify our position. One of our strengths, as much as Serov hates to admit it, is not only his old connection to the left, but also his connection with the workers who the left had so desperately attempted to win over to their side. While we are attempting to consolidate our control of Komi's political apparatus, we should also appeal to the workers of the region, who will know that Ordosocialism is the future for the Russian people! After all, harkening back to as early as the October Revolution, it's clear that the workers, who are used to being organized and consistently desire a role in government, are a potent tool in the hands of those who know how to use them."
 NIK_gcoup_flood_the_streets_desc:0 "Even from our party headquarters, secured by the most loyal of militias, we can hear the chaos going on in the streets of the capital. The coup went off without issue, of course, however the fallout has been greater than we were expecting, and the mayhem that our actions have caused seems to have paralyzed Syktyvkar. Even if we are now nominally in control of the republic, that reality won't last long if we don't take action against the rioters, leftist militia, and political dissidents that are trashing the once-orderly streets of our capital. Thus, we must flood the streets with our supporters, push all the weapons that we have into their hands and court violence against our opponents, lest they take action against us first."
 NIK_gcoup_crowd_dispersal_desc:0 "While it's great to have our supporters in the streets bashing the skulls of our enemies, it's not enough to ensure continued stability going forwards. Drawing on both our militias and our civilian supporters, we need to work on dispersing both current and future potential crowds that may meet that would either threaten or attempt to overthrow our new order. To do so, we have a number of methods at our disposal - political intimidation, the economic strangling of both party institutions and individuals, violence, and the good, old-fashioned firehose. At this point, it's just a matter of selecting what sort of methods we want to use and allocating the resources required to ensure that we can permanently restore order to Syktyvkar first, and after that, the rest of the republic."
 NIK_gcoup_nobody_enters_desc:0 "To our north are the treacherous agents of Suslov's allies. To our south and west are the threats of reaction and the German. In this critical time - at this very moment - we need to ensure that with our mounting internal issues, no external force can take advantage of the instability. By intensifying border patrols, mustering together loyal garrison and militia forces who will be able to prevent the ingress of any potential threat, we will be able to complete Suslov's personal wish that, in his words, "nobody enters into our new state". By isolating Suslov's disconnected leftists and ensuring that anyone caught attempting to enter our territory is treated with extreme prejudice, we can guarantee that our new administration is, for the time being, protected from most external threats of subversion."
 NIK_gcoup_the_guns_of_the_passionariyy_desc:0 "People like Suslov and Zhdanov talk about a "people's revolution" like they know what that would be. It's no secret that their political goals and aims are as disconnected from the people as their lifestyles are. However, Serov and his most loyal supporters, the true Ordosocialists, are just as concerned with the people's needs as workers just as much as they are with their needs as Russians. We must now prepare to cultivate our support among those that would willingly give it - the military, the workers, and any civilians who decide to fight with us against the bourgeoisie who have been reborn through the process of the republic. Once we have done that, and secured ourselves a place at the head of the ex-republic, we can then proclaim our goal of the True People's Revolution, ushering in an era of democratic centralism, a fair economy for the worker, and pride in the Russian nation!"
 NIK_gcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_faithful_desc:0 "Triumph! Now that we've managed to stave off a counter-coup and put our ideological enemies on the sidelines, we can finally begin to focus on the good - Ivan Serov and his most loyal servants have found themselves at the helm of the Komi Republic, and for the first time in a long time, a semblance of stability is returning to the capital and beyond. The nation belongs to the Ordosocialists, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that Russia is reforged in a nationalistic, socialist state! Anything less than that and we risk falling into stagnation and decadence - an unfortunate reality that can be prevented, so long as the correct steps are taken, under the wise guidance of Ivan Serov.\n\nFirst, we will secure the west, and then we can extend our authority over all of Russia! Forward, for Russia and her people!"

 NIK_dcoup_Taboritskys_coup_desc:0 "정부 내의 많은 이들은 세르게이 타보리츠키가 위협이 될 거라 생각해본 적이 없었습니다. 그들이 날뛰는 미친 노인네라고 부른 세르게이는 오래 전에 죽은 한 소년에게 집착했습니다. 때문에 모두는 권력이 언제나 공화국, 혹은 정당, 혹은 군의 손 안에 있을 것이라 생각했습니다. \n\n그들이 아직까지 살아서 지금의 타보리츠키를 볼 수 있었더라면 무슨 말을 했을까요.\n\n그리하여, 세르게이 타보리츠키는 진정한 황제 알렉세이가 발견되기 전까지 이 땅의 섭정으로서 복무할 것입니다. 얼마나 오래 걸리게 되든, 로마노프 가문의 사람이 다시금 제위에 앉을 것입니다. 하지만 내일이 될지도 모를 그 날까지, 오늘은 저 반역자들을 처리할 것입니다."
 NIK_dcoup_crush_the_institutions_desc:0 "코미 공화국은 200석의 입법체를 동반한 민주대통령제 아래서 오랫동안 기능해왔습니다. 이 비효율적인 기관들이 러시아의 수많은, 정말 수많은 적들에게 악용당하며 코미를 나약하게 했습니다. As it stands, they only subvert the Regent's - and by extension, the Emperor's - will, which is unacceptable. If the Emperor's glorious vision for Russia is to be restored, then these structures must be purged and the traitors within eliminated."
 NIK_dcoup_no_more_unwritten_rules_desc:0 "이 땅엔 세 개의 불문율이 존재합니다. (1) No killing the leaders of the many factions, for the good of the Republic, (2) Prevent unnecessary death, aid the injured if you can spare it, and (3) Do not interfere with the lives of civilians. These rules restrict the Regent's plans, and allow for the Jewish and Bolshevik infiltrators to grow in power. The factions must be eliminated, for they do not recognize the Emperor, and in fact conspire against him. This is unacceptable, and must be dealt with immediately. Our stormtroopers should not have to spare a thought for the safety of the Emperor's enemies, and any restrictions upon their righteous actions must be eliminated... The civilians are the greatest place for Jewish and Bolshevik infiltrators to hide once we have destroyed their power bases. The civilians too must be integrated into the Regent's grand plan to rebuild Russia in preparation for the true Emperor's return."
 NIK_dcoup_no_more_disorder_desc:0 "Disorder is the greatest enemy of the people, fueled by cursed Bolsheviks and Jewish infiltrators, and there is no greater source of disorder in these lands than the legislature. It's squabbling Deputies, it's inefficiency, it's Bolshevik influence. This heretical, unholy structure shall be torn down, so that its rotten influence can be purged. Its Deputies shall be rounded up, and dealt with like Judeo-Bolshevik enemies should be. Under the Regency, all that shall remain is order efficiency, and devotion to the Emperor. The true Emperor of Russia demands it."
 NIK_dcoup_march_to_the_tick_of_the_clock_desc:0 "과거 통치자들은 하느님께 통치하도록 선택받는 신성한 권리를 지녔습니다. 이 신성한 군주들의 뜻이 곧 하늘의 뜻 그 자체였습니다. 더러울 볼셰비키들이 권력을 잡았을 때 놈들은 황제의 뜻을 거스름으로써 하느님의 뜻 또한 거슬렀습니다. 재상의 권한이 속되며 이러한 설명에 부합할 가치조차 없다곤 해도, 섭정이 이 지상에서 하늘의 가장 위대하고도 가장 중요한 종, 황제를 섬긴다는 것은 아주 분명합니다. 황제 알렉세이의 성스러운 뜻에 대한 무엄이란 있을 수 없으니, 이와 같은 죄악은 빠르고 잔혹하게 처리될 것입니다. 이것이 신성 러시아의 황제의 성권입니다."
 NIK_dcoup_unleash_the_stormtroopers_desc:0 "The Regent has many loyal followers, but none more loyal than his stormtroopers. This paramilitary organization's duty is to enforce the will of Emperor Alexei. These fanatical soldiers shall be called upon to destroy the regency's numerous enemies, who wage open rebellion in the streets. In order to ensure the Regent's plans are carried out, these soldiers must be righteous, courageous, and merciless in the face of the enemy. They must strike fear into the hearts of the regency's enemies, and destroy any trace of their foul influence left within these lands."
 NIK_dcoup_open_the_arsenals_desc:0 "Many paramilitary organizations patrol these lands, led by those who would deny the Emperor's authority. To more effectively deal with these traitors, we may make use of the extensive Syktyvkar Arsenal. It ranges from nonlethal tear gas to devastating supplies of chlorine gas. We have no need for such extravagant measures shall find their purpose later, for now tear gas and similar armaments shall prove sufficient for eliminating our current enemies. Dissent and rebellion shall not be tolerated under the Regent's watch."
 NIK_dcoup_no_limits_desc:0 "섭정의 적들이... 처음 생각한 것보다 더 강하고 수도 더 많은 듯합니다. While we have not yet been forced to use the more extreme measures of the Syktyvkar Arsenal, their time is now. Chlorine gas and similar weapons are needed in order for our stormtroopers to destroy the Regent's enemies. No more limitations to our troops' effectiveness will be tolerated, even if it means the death count will begin to dramatically rise. If it serves the will of the Emperor, then no other path is necessary."
 NIK_dcoup_the_only_movement_left_desc:0 "민주정. 그건 러시아의 신성한 통치자들을 전복시킨 더러운 반역자들의 목표였습니다. 이런 이단적 개념의 끝도 머지 않았습니다. 공화국은 붕괴하여 섭정의 정의로운 추종자들의 손에 파괴됐습니다. 이제 섭정이 이 사실을 공식적 현실로서 선언할 때가 되었습니다. \n\n오늘부로 공화국은 공식적으로 해체되며, 그에 따라 이 땅은 이제 섭정의 통치를 받게 될 것입니다. 러시아의 진정한 황제께서 발견되기 전까지, 이 섭정제는 세르게이 타보리츠키가 이끌어가게 될 것입니다. 러시아 황제 알렉세이시여 만수하소서!"
 NIK_dcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_sturmoviks_desc:0 "끝났습니다. 섭정에 맞서던 멍청이들은 분쇄됐으며, 하느님(과 식팁카르의 병기창)께서 도우사, 구 공화국의 누구도 우리에게 도전할 힘과 의지를 갖지 못 합니다. 그럼에도 진정한 행업은 아직 시작도 되지 않았습니다. 섭정께선 단순히 황제께서 우리 품에 환어하시어 도시국가 하나를 다스리게 되실 것에 만족하지 못 합니다.\n\n아니죠, 황제께선 통일 러시아에 임하셔야 하고, 섭정은 그분의 머리 위에 제관을 씌워드릴 준비를 해야 마땅합니다. Preparations will be made to bolster the Imperial Army, augmenting it with the ample supplies of chemical weapons we now possess. Furthermore, detailed plans for industrialization and modernization of Western Russia have already been drawn by the Regent's learned hand, ready to be put into action.\n\nThe Regent has thus declared the reclamation of Western Russia begun."

 NIK_ucoup_eurasianists_coup_desc:0 "The fire of our passionarity rises - the time for battle is at hand! We have struck a telling blow against the leftists and weakling democrats of the Republic, but the struggle is not yet won. The Guide of the Passionarist Revolution exhorts us onwards to greater glory, and it shall be ours. We must tighten the noose around the Republic before anyone else has the chance to topple us from power."
 NIK_ucoup_social_sphere_permeation_desc:0 "The Russian people at large do not understand Eurasianism. They deride us as esotericists, or worse: leftists, for our humane and progressive understanding of our brother ethnoses. Our message must be propagated throughout the Republic, so that the people come to understand what it is we fight for and why our cause is worthy of their support."
 NIK_ucoup_a_common_cause_desc:0 "The other rightists are altogether too reactionary - or, in Serov's case, socialistic - for our liking, but they are not without redeeming qualities. Specifically, their loathing for leftists makes them fanatically dedicated to the common cause of crushing the Republic left-wing bloc. We should appeal to our shared interests, so that we can rally more forces to the defense of our new government."
 NIK_ucoup_sideline_Taboritsky_desc:0 "세르게이 타보리츠키는 delusions of grandeur에 사로잡힌 광인이지만, 쓸모는 있습니다. 공화국의 유일한 주요 군주주의자 인사인 그의 기치 아래 비슷한 생각을 지닌 이들이 몰려있으니, along with many of the Orthodox Church's more fervent defenders. He thus has a large contingent of well-trained, fanatical soldiers at his command. We would do well to court him - if we can bring him under our influence, perhaps we can sideline him more easily later on."
 NIK_ucoup_the_eurasia_plan_desc:0 "We must remember what we are fighting for: not Russia, but Eurasia. Our ambition is not to merely rebuild another stagnant, chauvinistic empire. We seek the construction of a new society, a new kind of global power. Eurasia will be a land that finds strength in its ethno-cultural diversity, united by a shared historical heritage: the superethnos!"
 NIK_ucoup_secure_the_concept_desc:0 "Before we embark on the journey towards Eurasia, we must ensure that our support base is secure. If we start building atop weak foundations, the entire structure will eventually topple. Eurasianists must be placed in key offices, propaganda distributed and our civilian supporters protected."
 NIK_ucoup_highlight_external_threats_desc:0 "The enemies of the Passionariyy are not self-reliant like we are. The democrats enjoy support throughout the countryside, while the leftists are almost certainly receiving support from the WRRF. We can use this to our advantage; by highlighting the threats that come from outside Syktyvkar, we can paint our cause as more legitimately 'native' to the Republic."
 NIK_ucoup_an_army_of_radicals_desc:0 "We have one of the largest paramilitaries in the Republic; let us put it to good use! We have the central government buildings in our hands, but there are still many important public buildings, transport hubs, warehouses and infrastructure centers that lie in enemy hands. Let us send forth our brave Eurasianist soldiers to claim what is rightfully ours!"
 NIK_ucoup_none_may_contest_desc:0 "A show of force is what we need! There are many citizens who still doubt the capabilities of our paramilitary. Of course, we are not Bolsheviks who will simply mow down dissenters. Instead, we can convince them of our might by launching decisive strikes against the foe and engaging them in open battle to prove our superiority."
 NIK_ucoup_komi_belongs_to_the_true_passionarists_desc:0 "Rally, brothers! Rally to the flag of Eurasia! This is for something greater than a dead empire, or a fallen union! This is for the future, for the ultimate manifestation of the superethnos! Drive the enemy from our lands and raise high the black flag of Eurasia!"

The consolidation of Ust-Sysolsk under our new order, thus, will begin immediately, until we are capable of shattering any enemy that dares move against us, be they internal or external.\n\nOur foes are many, but our people are strong, and, if all else fails, the arsenals below Syktyvkar can always be pressed into service for the true Russian state."

The arsenal beneath Syktyvkar, and its chemical stockpiles, is the greatest example of this, but there exists many other such stockpiles. We must unearth these caches immediately, and arm our forces with their contents. A well-armed force is critical for the expansion of our state, and the impending reclamation of Russia."

One could also be entirely wrong. The state of the infrastructure throughout Ust-Sysolsk is utterly dismal, with numerous trade routes and valuable paved roads completely ignored by the old government, in favor of investing more money into government corruption, failed welfare programs, and grandiose, unworkable projects.\n\nWe must rectify this situation at once, repairing old infrastructure and constructing new roads to move goods faster, and allow our soldiers to redeploy more effectively."
 NIK_fashexpansion_assemble_our_forces_desc:0 "There exist elements within our state that are sympathetic to our goals and motivations, yet were forbidden from gaining crucial military experience by the previous government. We will rectify this, as well, and expand our recruitment to those that formerly would have been discharged for 'radicalism' and 'disloyalty' by the old Republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc:0 "Despite everything we have done, our armament programs and recruitment programs, an army is nothing but a mob of ill-organized rabble without competent officers and quality training. We must assemble our army's high command and consult the officers of the Republican Army who have remained loyal to us, for a comprehensive new program of training and disciplining our forces."
 NIK_fashexpansion_oaths_of_loyalty_desc:0 "There is an important question vexing the political apparatus of the state, and the military apparatus alike. This question regards the oaths of loyalty that each soldier is to take. The old Republic had a set of oaths dedicated to protecting and upholding democracy, the Republic, and the Komi Constitution, which will clearly not do. However, the factions that make up our current government are conflicted as to which form the new oaths shall take.\n\nThe more monarchist-inclined groups wish to restore the Tsarist oaths, swearing loyalty to a crown and throne that are currently vacant. The more mainstream elements of the government, on the other hand, wish to reword the old Republican oaths to fit our newer, stronger state. There are even some elements within the state that view the Soviet oaths, and their commitment to ideology, as a possible model. The Army must come to a decision, to ensure the loyalty of our troops, and a united military."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_anti_bolshevik_pact_desc:0 "The state of Vyatka, under the Tsar Vladimir III, is not an ideal ally. Indeed, in a less desperate situation, it would be considered an enemy to strike down as soon as possible. However, we do not have the luxury of such an idyllic situation. With the growing red storm to our north, we must approach the pretender Tsar, for the good of both of us. Only once the Reds are defeated, may we have the luxury of reconsidering our foreign policy situation.\n\nWe must approach Vyatka with a proposed Anti-Bolshevik Pact, for mutual defense and shared training, until the sacred task of casting down the communists is completed."
 NIK_fashexpansion_better_than_the_reds_desc:0 "Vladimir has pulled through for us, and revealed himself as at least a semi-decent ally of our cause. He has agreed to commit to our Anti-Bolshevik Pact, and begin cooperating with our state for the purpose of putting down the Front... at least for the time being."
 NIK_fashexpansion_officer_exchanges_desc:0 "Our officers have faced different conditions to those of the Tsarists, and have served on the frontline in border raids against the Reds, in many cases. Our practical experience is a boon to us, but the Whites to our south have the theoretical advantage, having fought in the West Russian War against the Front on the grand scale. We have fought the communists in the present, and they have fought them in the past - there is much to learn on both of our ends. Let us share this knowledge with our partners against the red menace."
 NIK_fashexpansion_joint_army_maneuvers_desc:0 "Our doctrine has its strengths, but also its flaws. The more experienced units of Vyatka, thankfully, are willing to help rectify the issues present in our training, supply chain, and combat techniques. While their aid is to be viewed with suspicion, of course, what useful knowledge they provide is precious, and is to be taken seriously. If Vyatka can help us fill the holes in our army's pool of skill, its aid is to be greatly appreciated."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_civil_war_relived_desc:0 "The days of the Civil War were dark for our nation, setting the stage for the eventual national disintegration of our great country into what it is today. However, we now have a chance to reverse it. With the aid of Vyatka, we shall be able to strike back and vanquish the Reds which destroyed Russia, and erase all traces of communism in our nation. The time is now - the only question is who will set the Reds' demise into motion. Their foolish action... or our triumphant initiative."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_pretenders_betrayal_desc:0 "Typical. The false Tsar of Vyatka has rejected our pact, and decried us as fascists and traitors to Russia. Clearly, he has forgotten who is the fell and base Nazi collaborator, and who is the true Russian patriot. This betrayal, while it may seem mortal, shall not cripple us. We must rely only on our own strength and will, and through this, we will triumph over all who dare oppose us."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_propaganda_offensive_desc:0 "Clearly, the supposed Tsar has proven himself an enemy of our state, and by extension, an enemy of all the peoples of Russia. Through a repurposing of our broadcast infrastructure, and the abundance of print shops in our cities, we will begin a propaganda offensive against him, and his cruel, backwards regime. The Russian people must be lead to realize that the state in Vyatka is not the future of Russia - it is a relic of a dark, ineffectual past, little better than the Reds themselves!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_recognize_eurasian_strength_desc:0 "Our state is situated in a strategically useful area, with abundant resources, population, and industry. The communists, as evil as they are, after all, would not have made Ust-Sysolsk their temporary capital without reason. We must remind our people of this - that we are strong, that our soldiers are the greatest in Russia, with the will to protect their families and the nation that they love. We do not need allies, for allies are mere temporary, transient things, in the shifting mass of allegiances that is the new Russia. No - it is best to stand on our own, and strive out against the dark!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_ring_of_steel_desc:0 "There is no single defense plan that is sufficient to defend Ust-Sysolsk from all of the threats that surround us. With the hostile Tsar in the south, the erratic fanatics of Gayny to the East, the liberals to the West, and the Front practically on the doorstep of our capital, we must seek a single all-encompassing solution to our defensive woes.\n\nAnd that solution shall come in the form of a ring of steel. A vast network of fortifications must be constructed around our frontier, to defend our state from attack. While we do not have the resources to form a strong, consecutive string of fortifications, we shall be able to construct enough small border forts to ensure that attacks are greatly dissuaded. Ust-Sysolsk shall be secure from attack, from any angle, leaving us free to plot our grand reclamation of Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_eurasia_awaits_desc:0 "We have prepared enough, going through all of the preliminary strokes of diplomacy and armament. Now, is the time for expansion, and the reunification of the Motherland. Russia awaits, with her west open for our taking - there lies only our enemies standing in our way. They are many, and we are few, but with the will of the Russian people on our side, alongside our connections and our formidable arsenal, our state shall emerge triumphant, and reclaim her fair lands.\n\nWith our preparations complete, the only thing left to do is issue our orders to our diplomats and generals, and prepare for the greatest string of conflict that we shall face yet."
 NIK_fashexpansion_demand_gaynys_submission_desc:0 "The Order Of Saint George has a cause that one may consider righteous - to honor God, and to oppose the anarchy that has consumed the Motherland. However, they are insular, radical, and unwilling to cooperate with outsiders, viewing them as insufficiently pious at best, and outright heretical at worst. For better or for worse, we must end this policy, by force, and issue an ultimatum to the monks of the Squirrel's Nest Fortress - submit to our state, and be free to practice their religion within our borders, following our laws, or face our armies on the battlefield."
 NIK_fashexpansion_embrace_the_church_desc:0 "With the Gayny settlement under our control, and the Order now within our jurisdiction, now is a prime opportunity to set a precedent for our future religious policy. As always, the factions within our government are split on this issue, with a wide range of theories stretching from cracking down on religion to embracing the Orthodox Church as a central pillar of Russian culture. Throughout our state, other religious groups are looking to our policy on this issue as a guideline towards what they, too, should expect in the future from our government's policies."
 NIK_fashexpansion_rebuild_the_monestaries_desc:0 "Although the monasteries and fortresses controlled by the Order were grand, not even they were immune to the ravages of war and the bombings. Throughout the long decades of shame experienced by Russia, the churches and monasteries of Gayny have stood strong, but have not escaped entirely unscathed.\n\nAs a show of goodwill towards the Order of Saint George, and towards the Orthodox Church in general, the more traditionalist elements of our government have advocated for a comprehensive program to rebuild the religious architecture of Gayny. The reception of this plan has been mixed, with more modernist elements railing against it as a waste of valuable resources."
 NIK_fashexpansion_anti_bolshevik_maneuvers_desc:0 "The West Russian Revolutionary Front, to our north, represents the greatest threat to our state, and the successful creation of a Russia free of communist influence. However, the likelihood that we will be able to cast it down right away is insufficient to make our generals entirely certain. To this end, we must determine a policy towards our consolidation of the region - securing a barrier against the Front's expansion, before striking it down, or launching a pre-emptive attack while the Front is distracted with other matters."
 NIK_fashexpansion_consolidate_the_bloc_desc:0 "We must choose to delay our strike on the Front, and instead target the 'neutral' state of Vologda that lies to our west. By striking at Vologda, we will be able to lock down everything south of the Front's current territories, starving the communists and preventing them from bringing any more of Russia under their hateful influence. Additionally, we will be capable of using the resources of the city for our own purposes, for the future reclamation of the West."
 NIK_fashexpansion_ultimatum_to_the_neutrals_desc:0 "The state of Vologda presents an interesting dilemma for our generals. It has a decent army, although not as strong as the Front itself, yet it is, at least formally, apolitical. Our strategists have deemed it as possibly having sympathies with our cause of a communist-free Russia, but possibly opposed to our 'extremist' ideology. Thus, it is at least worth an attempt at diplomacy. Putting our best foot forward, we will send an ultimatum to Vologda, offering them compensation for unification with our state, and significant investments in their region. If they do not accept our generous offer, of course, there will be trouble..."
 NIK_fashexpansion_cast_down_democracy_desc:0 "Vologda has been secured, whether it be by penstroke or gunshot. Now, there lies the task of casting down the 'democratic' institutions of the former city-state, much as we dissolved the same weakened, backwards institutions in our own state. Our promises to the people of Vologda will stand... to an extent, but we must alter the deal regarding their level of autonomy within our state. We will have no tolerance for potential havens of liberalism, within our very borders."
 NIK_fashexpansion_pre_empetive_strike_desc:0 "As tempting of a target that it is, the WRRF must be our primary objective for attack. Allowing it to consolidate itself any further is unacceptable from a strategic standpoint - with the level of disarray it finds itself in at the moment, we could find ourselves able to defeat it as easily as the Germans shattered Bukharin's Union in the second world war. The men must be prepared - we have no time to waste."
 NIK_fashexpansion_strike_the_front_desc:0 "Everything is ready. Our guns are loaded, our tanks are fuelled, and our men are aware of our plans to tear down the communist abomination. All that awaits is to send the signal that shall propel us to the final war against the Reds, and the beginning of the reclamation of Russia!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_purge_the_last_remnants_desc:0 "The Front has been cast down, but our work against Bolshevism does not end here. Throughout Arkhangelsk, there lies legions of officers and commissars, some of whom who have fought to spread the Red plague through Russia since before Bukharin's defeat. There is only one option - we must neutralize their influence, forever and always, to ensure that Bolshevism never returns to our lands. There is to be only two possible fates for Reds - a cold cell, or hot lead."
 NIK_fashexpansion_mop_up_the_spare_desc:0 "In our dash to consolidate power in our region, we have been forced to prioritize one threat over the other. The threat we have mercifully ignored has continued to exist... until now. We must utilize the resources of our newly conquered territory to cast it down, and finalize the consolidation of our control over the region."
 NIK_fashexpansion_dissolve_the_pact_desc:0 "With the Reds gone and buried, our pact with the Tsar to the south has outlived its usefulness. Vyatka no longer represents a possible ally, but rather a rival for regional supremacy. The pact must be formally dissolved at once, and our forces prepared to strike south at a moment's notice.\n\nVladimir, of course, does not need to know about this until the time comes."
 NIK_fashexpansion_topple_the_tsar_desc:0 "The time has come to strike south, finally, and secure the fertile lands of Vyatka. The Tsar, the pretender Vladimir III, may pretend that his army is a pre-eminent power, but we know the truth, from careful observation. The White Army is tired, with outdated tactics and aging generals - the time for the old empire has long since passed on.\n\nThere can be no peace or compromise with this symbol of the distant, shameful past - there is only to be a swift strike over the Vyatka River, bringing an end to the last relic of the Russian Civil War."
 NIK_fashexpansion_indulge_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Despite the shameful state of Vyatka, and the treacherous nature of the false Tsar Vladimir, the ideology of monarchism is hardly discredited as a viable means of governing Russia. Sergey Taboritsky and his monarchist faction, while quite divergent from the rest of our front, are influential nonetheless, and advocate strongly for preserving and protecting the history of the Tsardom.\n\nTo indulge Taboritsky and his followers, we could place several of his supporters in high administrative positions in the newly conquered territories of Vyatka, with Taboritsky himself as the local governor. While this will most certainly allow him to gain power, influence, and support amongst the people, could it be worth it to ensure that the holy traditions of Russia are preserved, protected, and rightfully revered?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_crownlands_are_eurasian_desc:0 "With Vyatka captured, and its vast population now under our guiding hand, the time has come to incorporate and integrate the territory. Officials must be tested for loyalty, taxes must be collected, bandits and holdouts must be eliminated, and censuses must be conducted. Only once this long process of integration is complete, can we hope to see the full potential of our latest conquest finally realized."
 NIK_fashexpansion_relocate_the_capital_desc:0 "Our current capital, Ust-Sysolsk, has great benefits. It is far from the frontlines, in a strategic location, and has years and years of administrative framework dating from the days of the WRRF and all the way to the dawn of the new state. However, another option exists, one that has been realized by the newly integrated region of Vyatka.\n\nThe city of Vyatka itself would make an excellent new capital for our state, hosting all of the ministries and infrastructure that were used by the Tsar to manage his realm. It lies in a central location, with a large and fairly loyal population, and is on a much more conveniently located river, for ease of transportation. To move the government is a daunting task, and some may say impractical at this point in time, but with our state's newfound strength, it can surely be realized easily."
 NIK_fashexpansion_secure_the_border_desc:0 "Along the long and porous border of the German occupation zone, numerous states have sprung up, forming a clear western flank to secure against potential German invasion. We should prioritize securing this border strip and eliminating the various warlords that pose easy routes for a German incursion into Russia's heartland. Only we can be trusted to effectively defend against the German scourge, and our rhetoric towards the warlords of the West must reflect this."
 NIK_fashexpansion_punish_the_pirates_desc:0 "The city of Nizhny Novgorod, on the intersection of the mighty Volga and the Oka rivers, is an absolutely crucial strategic asset and population center, forming a veritable lynchpin for any who wish to have a serious chance of unifying Russia. Its tank factories will be critical for striking down stronger foes in the future, and its population will be an invaluable asset.\n\nThis, however, can only be achieved by capturing the city in the first place. Currently, the city and its vast industry are controlled by a glorified gang of bandits and communists, who have dedicated themselves to raiding their neighbors, and growing fat on their spoils. This, however, can be used to our advantage. A message shall be sent to Averin, the leader of the Gorky bandits. Stand down and hand over the city, and he will be rewarded with further riches. Refuse to surrender, and he will be shot like a dog."
 NIK_fashexpansion_absorb_the_tank_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet of assembled tanks and support elements is considered by many of our generals to be the true prize of Nizhny Novgorod - a vast reserve of armored power that can be deployed against our future foes. The bandits controlling the city before us at least had the foresight to hire competent personnel to arm them, and keep the factories running. We will profit from this by extension, and mobilize the motorpool of Nizhny Novgorod for the purpose of our state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_control_their_factories_desc:0 "Whereas the current personnel running the factories of Nizhny Novgorod are at least semi-competent, they are hardly loyal to us and only us. A less charitable state could denounce them as a pack of mercenaries loyal only to profit. In light of this, some changes in their management must be pursued. Rather than following the logic of the bandits' market, the heavy industry of Nizhny Novgorod must be put under direct control, for the purpose of aiding our sacred task to reunify the Motherland."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_tatar_ultimatum_desc:0 "While the Tatars have seceded from the Motherland, they have reason to do so. After all, the Soviet Union was atrocious towards the Turkic population, attempting to stamp out their passionarity and ensure their servitude. Gumilyov has proposed a plan to appeal to the Tatars, with a formal diplomatic request. If they join our state, they shall join us as equals, and have their culture honored as one that is developed and mighty in its own right. If they refuse, however, we will have no choice but to send in the tanks. We are merciful, of course, but we cannot tolerate opposition."
 NIK_fashexpansion_break_the_tatars_desc:0 ""Tatarstan" is nothing but another rightful province within Russia, and the Tatars are merely Russians that have refused to assimilate. Through a swift and decisive invasion of the renegade Tatar state, we will be able to put an end to this separatist nonsense, and secure the city of Kazan as a crucial component of our new Russian state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_measure_of_respect_desc:0 "As fellow peoples of the steppe, and fellow conquerors, we hold a special kinship with the Tatars. Together, we have existed for centuries, travelling across the vast plains of Eurasia. While they are not Russian, they are our fellows and companions, and must be respected as such. The Tatars will be given their own autonomy within our state, where their culture may be conserved. Our passionarity is akin, and so our races are kin."
 NIK_fashexpansion_russians_in_all_but_name_desc:0 "The Tatars are conquered once more, and once more their separatist urges are defeated. What the region of 'Tatarstan' truly needs is not autonomy or recognition, but rather a total integration. Kazan, and the lands around it, will be incorporated into our new state wholesale. There is to be no native autonomy, for why should there be? The Tatars are merly Russians that have lost their way, and their culture is merely a relic of their collective delusion."
 NIK_fashexpansion_ghosts_of_the_war_desc:0 "The Russian Liberation Army, a German construction of the West Russian War, has found their home in the city of Samara, and permeated the region like a cancer. While they may claim to possess ideals compatible with ours, or indeed compatible with the Russian people at all, they are nothing but traitors and German lapdogs.\n\nVlasov has committed the greatest possible violation of the Motherland's honor, by serving those who wish to see the Russian people themselves cast down and reduced to a state below that of animals. For this, the ROA deserves nothing but swift and total destruction. Our armies are ready. Let their wrath descend upon Samara, and shatter the traitors once and for all."
 NIK_fashexpansion_scour_samara_desc:0 "Samara is ours, and with it, we have secured miles upon miles of fruitful land, dozens of factories, and arsenals overflowing with useful equipment. However, we have also inherited another, less valuable thing. Traitors.\n\nSympathizers with the Russian Liberation Army, and the Germans, fill our newly occupied territory, and their partisans continue to fight our forces in many areas. The solution to this problem is simple. A grand crackdown on this treason, and no mercy for any poor fool who dares carry on the cause of a dead traitor."
 NIK_fashexpansion_push_to_the_urals_desc:0 "The Urals are the natural far eastern border of this first phase of our expansion, with the exception of the unassailable Vorkuta. A selection of petty warlords dares to exist along the lines of the mountains, relying on the natural barriers and isolation to protect them from true contenders such as our state.\n\nNo longer. We will sweep south, along the grand mountain range, and secure our eastern border from those that wish to attack from the lands of the fell West Siberian People's Republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_slaughter_the_syncretists_desc:0 "The Mladorossi may be incomprehensible to the uneducated, but we are no simplistic peasants. We are aware of their true leanings - their complex ideology that values national strength, tradition, and rapid development. They are not communists, who we must oppose, nor backwards, mindless monarchists, but rather represent an ideology that could do great things in practice. Kazembek is a reasonable man - we shall send him a diplomatic request, and offer a position within our government in exchange for his full cooperation in the integration of Berezniki into our reformed state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_welcome_the_true_fascists_desc:0 "Our appraisal of the Mladorossi was correct, it seems, and the integration of Berezniki into our state is projected to go by without a hitch. The ideology of the Mladorossi continues to be a fascinating element, one that is quite appealing to many within our state, especially the followers of Taboritsky. The development of Berezniki can be greatly hastened by leaving its administration more or less untouched, and allowing the current government to exist with only minimal oversight."
 NIK_fashexpansion_purge_the_crypto_socialists_desc:0 "It seems that our generous appraisal of the Mladorossi was granted too soon. The Mladorossi have resisted every attempt to negotiate, and bring them into the fold, after our occupation of Berezniki and comparatively light-handed treatment of their organization. No longer. Kazembek and his highest officials shall be arrested and imprisoned, with trials broadcast over radio. This will serve as a warning to the rest of the Mladorossi - cease their organization against our regime, or face the same fate."
 NIK_fashexpansion_death_to_the_racial_traitors_desc:0 "Centered around the city of Perm lies quite possibly the most abominable foe we have ever faced. Unlike the ROA, who have only betrayed the Russian nation, the so-called "Aryans" of Perm have slandered, spat on, and dishonored everything that it means to be Russian. They denounce their true race as degenerate and subhuman, instead aspiring to the alleged heights of the hated conqueror that has struck our nation down to such a low status. There can be no mercy in return for this insult - we must mobilize our armies, and strike down this abomination, to save the very souls of the people trapped under the false "Aryan" yoke."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_second_purification_desc:0 "The Aryan Brotherhood claimed that they had 'purified' their lands, removing the stain of the 'untermensch' and instating a new order under their enlightened rule. This is, of course, mere delusion. The city of Perm and the lands around it have been stripped bare of their character, and the peoples of the region have been abused and enslaved by the "Aryans". We must aid the region, liberating the people from their chains, prosecuting the leaders of the damned cult, and installing a completely new local administration. The crimes which one must commit to be considered Aryan are a clear tell-tale that none of the Brotherhood's members are to be trusted. Thankfully, now, they will forever bear the marks of shame."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_bashkir_ultimatum_desc:0 "Similarly to the Tatars, the Bashkirs are another Turkic ethnicity that has historically lived alongside the Russian people since time immemorial. They possess a strong sort of passionarity, akin to those of Russians. Despite our differences, we were meant to be bound together, and so, we will dispatch a diplomatic mission to Ufa. If the Bashkirs are wise, they will accept our offer of union without resistance, and join us in the halls of history. If they foolishly refuse, there will be no other option but war."
 NIK_fashexpansion_our_turkic_brethren_desc:0 "The lands of Bashkiria are once more returned to us, firmly under our rightful control. In the process of integrating the region, assigning administrators, and beginning censuses, we must remember the most important component of dealing with our companion races - respect for their traditions, and co-existence as fellow peoples of Eurasia, and the steppes. Our passionarity is alike, and with them, we are stronger than we would be alone."
 NIK_fashexpansion_end_the_bashkir_heresy_desc:0 "The so-called independent republic of Bashkiria is nothing but a separatist fantasy, an illegitimate state carved out of the territory of what is rightfully Russian. Its Islamist nature is contrary to the very nature of the Russian civilization, and the separatist nationalism held by its peoples is an affront to our sensibilities. Bashkiria will be rightfully taken into Russia once more, through bullet and bomb, fire and sword."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_unitary_russia_desc:0 "The state of Bashkiria is once more within our grasp, and its armies have been routed before our superior firepower. All that is left to do now is to integrate the former Bashkiria as a new province within the new Russian state. The new administrative unit shall be named Ufa Oblast. A replacement of the administration shall follow, with Russian-language curriculum instated, and a census run to determine the exact population and demographic composition of the region. The mistakes of the past in dealing with the Bashkirs will not be repeated."
 NIK_fashexpansion_restoration_day_desc:0 "Today, the most momentous occasion in the history of our new state has arrived - the day of the reunification of the territories West of the Urals. Through our labor, blood, and diplomatic efforts, all of west Russia has finally come under the control of our new state. Our vast lands extend from Arkhangelsk to Samara, with a loyal and proud population millions strong. For this achievement, the end of warlordism and Bolshevism in our lands, a national holiday shall be declared, and parades held in all of our major cities.\n\nTruly, today is the first step in the rise of a new, proud Russia - it is the day of the beginning of the end of the enemies of the Motherland!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_lessons_from_unification_wars_desc:0 "The enemies we faced in the re-unification wars to restore West Russia were varied in their tactics, ideologies, and equipment. From the deep battle of the communists, to the manuever warfare of the ROA, we have faced every doctrine that could be thrown against us, and we have emerged victorious. However, this does not mean we should grow complicit. There is always more to learn, from our defeated foes, and integrating techniques and tactics from past enemies could help us refine our formal strategies even further. The general who does not adapt to changing paradigms, after all, is doomed to fall to a general that does."
 NIK_fashexpansion_finalize_industrial_policy_desc:0 "The industrial base of Russia has developed since the West Russian War, despite Bukharin's disastrous policies. However, it has not developed in a sane or consistent manner. Various warlord states' grandiose industrial visions have been carried out in clashing, contradictory ways, with redundant supply chains and technologies intended to make use of domestic resources. One of the most critical economic issues we face is binding all of our regional economies together, making use of the enhanced economics of scale, and working to ensure that functional and efficient logistics networks are operational."
 NIK_fashexpansion_roads_that_bind_us_desc:0 "Expanding on our logistical ambitions, another issue that we must face is our lack of coherent centralized rail or road systems. While warlord states did indeed build roads, they were often insular and limited, not connected to roads in other fiefdoms. An understandable priority, but one that we most rectify. New bridges must be build over rivers that once formed borders between warring states, collapsed tunnels must be re-excavated, and miles upon miles of road and rail must be laid, to build the new ties that bind us together as a true nation, rather than a mere collection of smaller states."
 NIK_fashexpansion_revitalized_russian_people_desc:0 "Most importantly of all of our reforms to the new Russian state, the people's morale and political will must be revived. For too long, warlord conflict, bombings, and stavation has eroded the shared identity of the Russian people, and eaten at the Russian patriotism within the hearts of the populace.\n\nA patriotic curriculum in schools must be established, focusing on our shared Russian identity. At long last, our people shall once more be revitalized, and their hearts shall beat with pride for our new state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_one_last_chance_desc:0 "Only one more task remains to ensure our complete control over West Russia, and our mandate to unite the rest of Eurasia. The reclamation of the territory of Onega, and a victory over the state of Finland on the field of battle. Finland presents a unique opportunity, as our gateway to Europe - securing a favorable peace deal with the Finnish state will both allow for possible territorial reclamation, but also serves as a show of strength to Germany and all other Pakt-aligned nations. By defeating Finland, we can secure honor and recognition in the eyes of the international community, and be respected for our triumphant martial prowess."

 NIK_fashexpansion_the_internal_conflict_desc:0 "When a united right wing coalition was announced, few could believe an alliance of different parties was possible; even fewer believed this coalition could get into power. However, those skeptics are now proving themselves right as the faction leaders feud and bicker amongst themselves. The question of when it will collapse is not a matter of if, but when. The civil servants who run the country must prepare for the coalition's dissolution and a return to factionalism and infighting, ensuring that the new power struggle will not be as destructive as the old."
 NIK_fashexpansion_crack_the_coalition_desc:0 "The Coalition as it stands is a complete farce. Every day, its representatives in the National Assembly fight each other with words and with fists over the most trivial matters of policy. Notifications to the leaders of rival parties and issuing declarations of revoking our participation in the Coalition will be easy to send, and the likelihood of other parties accepting is very high. The official dissolution of the Coalition may mean a return to the days of constant deadlock, political infighting and inter-party street battles, but at the very least it will reflect the current reality on the assembly floor."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_new_oaths_desc:0 "The Coalition lies in shambles, its members are feuding with each other both in the debating hall and the street, and the National Assembly is aimless in its direction. If its representatives were to swear allegiance to one party, it would do much to restore public faith in the government, particularly as few citizens believe they have loyalty to anyone other than themselves. However, the question of who to swear loyalty to remains. It is still divided among party lines, and pledging allegiance to one would only unite the Assembly against them. Many deals and compromises will have to be made between leadership and representatives, but a united Assembly may just be possible."
 NIK_fashexpansion_make_a_break_for_it_desc:0 "The men who were once the torchbearers for a new vision of Russia have devolved into bickerers and factionists. The old guard of the Passionariyy can no longer be trusted to rebuild the Motherland - however, that does not mean Russia does not have a future any more. Taboritsky, Serov, and others did not join the Passionariyy out of idealism, but of convenience, but they are the ones who the torch shall be passed onto, who shall return Russia to glory. Perhaps a proposal to cut them a deal to increase their power in Komi is in the works."
 NIK_fashexpansion_forward_to_the_future_desc:0 "Serov is an outlier, a self-proclaimed socialist who believes that the Russian worker should be the centre of the new Russian order the Passionariyy seek to create. Thus far, he has been almost completely rejected by more orthodox Passionariyy members, which makes his vision so invigorating. By agitating the common people and showing them how the rise of Russia is in the best of interests for workers across the nation, he may be the one who can reinvigorate Russia with their strength and lead her back to glory."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_red_brown_alliance_desc:0 "Communism and its platitudes of equality for all people has been properly consigned into the pages of history; however, a sizable contingent of people refuse to acknowledge this. However, rather than showing them how obsolete their beliefs are in person, with the rise of Serov, it may be more useful to find them places in the Passionariyy order. Certainly not all men are created equal, but all Russian workers are, and by convincing them to abandon their delusional belief that foreigners should be treated the same as Russians, we will be rewarded with a large base of experienced politicians in our quest to rebuild Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_lessons_from_the_late_puppetmaster_desc:0 "Serov disagreed with Suslov on many things, but he had to admit, his rival had a real head for politicking. If Serov could emulate some of Suslov's methods, it would go a long way towards fulfilling Serov's dream of an orderly, Socialist Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_back_to_the_past_desc:0 "Russia is a sick country. The Motherland is bitterly divided, and her people are fearful and in want, easy prey to the traitors and parasites that feast upon her sickened body. Taboritsky tells us it wasn't always like this. Under the Holy Tsar, he says, the Russians walked the path of righteousness. Everyone knew their place in the world and did their duty to the Motherland and for that, she wielded immense wealth and power. Taboritsky wants us to improve our wretched condition, return to the natural order and step back on the path of righteousness. Once we return to the traditional way of things, he promises, the glories of the past will return to us.\n\nDoes the future of Russia lie in the past?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_consolidate_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Many in Komi share our desire for a return to Monarchy, but not all of them support our Presidency. This is folly. Now that we have taken power, the cause of Monarchism is inescapably tied to us - if we should fail, it will fail along with us. We must make Monarchists of every political bent see that we are the only chance they have at seeing their vision for Russia fulfilled: The Holy Tsar restored, reigning in a Russia that has returned to greatness."
 NIK_fashexpansion_alexei_lives_desc:0 "In the early hours of July 17, 1918, the Holy Tsar was murdered by Bolshevik traitors. It was said at the time that his only son and heir, Tsarevich Alexei, was murdered as well. That was a lie. The righteous Tsar lives! Whisked away before the traitors could kill him, and in hiding for almost fifty years now, he awaits the time when Russia has returned to the path of righteousness. Only then he will return and restore the greatness we all knew in the past. Until that time, Sergey Taboritsky will rule in his place as Regent, to unite Russia behind his rule and make the country ready for his return."
 NIK_fashexpansion_strengthen_the_passionariyy_desc:0 "Now that the Passionariyy is in power, the outside elements have outlived their usefulness and only serve to hold us back from our true vision. Let us cut the dead flesh away, so that the living core may grow stronger!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_embolden_the_hardliners_desc:0 "Lev Gumilyov founded the Passionariyy Organization to promote his idea of Eurasia. That idea, and his proposed path towards realizing it, came to lay the foundation for our work. Since then, the organization has come to encompass a much broader range of political thought and groupings, but it is now time to unite around one. If Gumilyov's faction carries the day, they will seek to consolidate the Passionariyy, then lead us to a future where we can rise above petty concerns and regionalisms to pursue their grand vision of United Eurasia. They won't have us emulate either the West or the East, but embrace our position as a bridge between them."
 NIK_fashexpansion_new_nationalism_desc:0 "Nationalism is an important force in the republic and the lands beyond, and strongly felt by its population. Far too often, however, it takes the form of petty regionalism. We are not "Komi" people, nor are we "Russians". We are the beating heart of the Eurasian super-ethnos. We must educate our people of their true place in the world, so that they will fully share in our struggle to realize the great state of United Eurasia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_eurasia_forever_desc:0 "The path to reunification will be long and hard and full of struggle, but we will never falter. Our country is torn apart by petty warlords and traitors, who spouse petty regionalisms to keep our people divided. We will not be fooled by them. Some now say that we should limit our goals, Russia, they say, is our motherland. They are wrong! We have always been greater, the fate of our people always been more glorious, than the dead state of Russia. We will fight on until every petty warlord is beaten, we will fight until every Eurasian is gathered under our banner. We will not rest until our common destiny is realized. Eurasia forever!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_depend_on_the_moderates_desc:0 "Most of our popular support is centered on the moderate wing of our alliance, led by Igor Shafarevich. His promises to respect the republic while reaffirming our national traditions is what sanitized our party to voters beyond the hard core of our constituencies. Adopting his gradualist approach and "national democratic" ideal will maintain support and stability while we implement our ideas."
 NIK_fashexpansion_compassionate_fascism_desc:0 "As the people must serve the state, so must the state serve the people. Our commitment to uphold strict moral values gives us a strong foundation from which to build such a state. Now it's time to build on that foundation. We must ensure our people are warm and safe. We must feed their bellies and their thirst for purpose. We must not think of the work as easy, or of ourselves as infallible, but work gradually and learn from our mistakes. Our values will be the foundation, each successive reform will be a brick, and soon we will have built a grand structure to house all of the republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_an_experimental_dream_desc:0 "Our duty to restore our country to greatness will never be done, and dogmatic adherence to past decisions will only hinder us in our work. While there is a time and place for spectacular action, it is through the many small successes of our day-to-day struggle that we will realize our dreams for tomorrow. We will be pragmatic in how we rule the republic, we will be practical in our day-to-day rule and we will apply the lessons learnt from past failures - both our own and those of others. As long as we remain true to our ethos of compassionate conservatism and informed by the ancient traditions of our nation, we can afford to experiment with policy."
 NIK_fashexpansion_unite_the_party_desc:0 "Our movement is home to a great variety of political groupings, united only by their common rejection of both communism and the status quo in the republic. This breadth has served us well in getting this far, but the cracks between groupings are showing more clearly by the day, and our cohesion suffers as a result. It is time to sharpen our focus. We will reunite the Organization around the alliance at the core of the Passionariyy, the partnership between Igor Shafarevich and Lev Gumilyov. While they disagree on some points, both are used to working with the other, and the two of them together will command a stronger, more focused Passionariyy."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_anti_establishment_alliance_desc:0 "The places of Sergey Taboritsky and Ivan Serov have always been at the fringes of our movement, and with the upcoming convention they are at risk of being sidelined by their more established rivals. Together, they might be able to accomplish what neither can do on their own - scrape together enough support to alter the course of the movement, and take control of the Organization. Surely the most temporary of alliances, as the two men disagree on almost everything except their desire for a substantial change in direction and leadership, the pact needs to hold together long enough to defeat their chief rivals and reduce the running to a two-horse race."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_convention_desc:0 "To an outside observer, the Great Convention of the Passionariyy Organization must be a decidedly odd spectacle. The effort to get a big tent party comprising social conservatives, radical eurasianists, traditional monarchists and everything in between to agree on a shared doctrine is proving to be a challenge. So challenging, in fact, that an alternative proposal for uniting the party is quickly becoming the preferred option. Called the "Convergence", it consists of a vote, to be held at the end of the assembly, to determine the leader of the Organization and the new Head of State."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_final_words_desc:0 "The Convergence looms. Lines are being drawn ever more firmly as the primary leadership candidates make their last appeals to the voting membership. There are no more debates to be had, no more backroom deals to be made. The four men will each make a final speech and then - the decision. The only other question to be decided is who will be the one to speak last. It's the most desired position in the order of speeches by all four candidates, and whoever secures it will have gained both the prestige of a small victory and the perceived benefit of having the last word before the vote. Who will it be?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_convergence_desc:0 "The final speeches have been held, and it is time for the Convergence to take place. Four men will enter the National Assembly as candidates, each hoping to emerge from the vote as president, ready to guide the Passionariyy to achieve their vision. Only one will succeed. With everything now at stake, tensions are running high. The candidates have all committed to respect the assembly, but it's anyone's guess how long that respect goes should the tide turn against them."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_focus_on_methods_desc:0 "The breadth of thought in our movement extends to political strategy. While there is a general agreement we need to be diligent in managing public support and opposition, what measures we should use and where our focus should be is proving a difficult discussion. Some believe that information campaigns about our great work should be enough to keep the public on our side. Others propose we tie ourselves much more strongly to the Orthodox Church. There is also support for campaigns to suppress dissent and opposition more forcefully, with disagreement centering more on the proposed extent and violence of them. It is time to make a decision."
 NIK_fashexpansion_draft_a_constitution_desc:0 "In order to strengthen our hold on the republic and guide it to a better future, we should draft a new constitution. This will mark a break with the corrupt old order and let us show the republic our good intentions. That the drafting process will show us where the prominent voices in our organization land on key issues, and who in our organization commands the influence to push their favorite clauses through is just an added benefit, of course."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_united_left_desc:0 "There's little love lost between Ivan Serov and Igor Shafarevich. If there ever was a time for the two men to bury the hatchet, however, it is now. Every day, the cracks in our movement are becoming more apparent, and the looming reckoning more clear. If the prospect of losing a power struggle was not enough to make bedfellows of the two, the men they would be losing to will be. Lev Gumilyov and Sergey Taboritsky have enough grandiose delusions between them to equip a ward full of mental patients. Combined with influence, power and a lack of scruples, either could do great damage to the state."

 NIK_burgsys_eyes_in_every_house_desc:0 "안타깝게도, 섭정의 성스러운 직무의 중요성이나 본질을 이해하는 러시아인은 거의 없습니다. 자신도 모르는 새 유대인 적들에게 영향을 받은 그들은 하나님의 빛을 피하며 거짓말의 베일 밑에 자신의 비밀을 숨깁니다. 그 눈에 띄지 않는 곳에서 그들은 러시아의 영혼을 더럽히는 더러운 전염병을 퍼뜨리면서, 곪아 썩어갑니다.\n\n다행히도, 가장 무지몽매한 영혼들에게도 미약하게나마 빛이 남아 있습니다. 동전의 짤랑거림과 총의 장전음으로, 러시아의 사람들은 올바른 길로 꾀어내지거나 밀쳐질 수 있습니다. 조금만 끈기 있게 지속하면 천한 자들의 모든 어두운 비밀이 밝혀질 것이고, 섭정의 충실한 신하들은 그들이 말살되는 것을 보게 될 것입니다."

Key to his plans is his ideology, that of "Compassionate Conservatism." No longer shall the peoples of Russia be driven against one another by a difference in ideals and class, all shall be one, as God had intended.

However, while cooperation birthed by convenience would be beneficial to both us and the Americans, they may be reluctant at accepting our unique cultural formation as part of the so-called Free World.

Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard.

It's easy to say that we should reunite Russia and reconquer Moscowien, ending German influence in Russia once and for all, but what of after? What will our new Russia look like? How should the Russian people strive to be? We must answer these questions."
 NIK_natsoc_the_revolutionary_succession_desc:0 "Despite what others have said about our ideology, Ordosocialism is very much a leftist ideology. We should embrace this revolutionary, progressive, and socialist identity and use it to our advantage. There are still many who yearn for the old Soviet Union, and believe in the old ways of communism. By embracing the leftist nature of our ideology, we might be able to reach out and integrate them into the cause. Whether they be former Suslovites, hardcore communists, or moderate socialists, we welcome them all with open arms."
 NIK_natsoc_our_own_way_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that in the earlier years of reunification, proponents of Ordosocialism had to align themselves with right wing groups in order to carry out our ideological goals. Unfortunately, such groups have become a thorn in our side as we have begun to consolidate our political power under Serov. They project the image that the party isn't unified in its goals and ideals, and that projects weakness. They will have to be expelled from the party, and should they continue to be so vocal about their views on Ordosocialism after they leave, then we will have to use other means to deal with them."
 NIK_natsoc_red_white_reconciliation_desc:0 "Ordosocialism isn't one monolithic mode of thought or ideology. It is an ideology with the capacity to change and adapt. In this case, in order to further the party's interests and influence in Russia at large, we will need to appeal to a broader range of Russians who ascribe to all sorts of politics. To that end, we should seek to incorporate the right wing into the Ordosocialist apparatus of the party. Accepting these people into the fold can only serve to strengthen us in our interests going forward."
 NIK_natsoc_together_to_greatness_desc:0 "In order to mend the rift that has grown between the leftist Ordosocialists and the right wing Ordosocialists, we should approach some right wing leaders with offers of positions in government. These positions won't be glamorous or particularly powerful, but it would go a long way towards normalizing and improving relations with them. This may slightly weaken Serov's power within the party, but by opening up our candidate selection pool for jobs in the government to people further to the right, we will also be expanding our talent pool, increasing the government's ability to find skilled candidates for jobs."
 NIK_natsoc_the_proletarian_nation_desc:0 "At the heart of Ordosocialism lies the Russian worker. The proletariat is and will always be the most important aspect of Ordosocialism, and of Russia as a whole. After all, Russia is the birthplace of the revolution, of socialism as a viable ideology. We must cling to this identity, even in the face of the oppressive German and Japanese Empires. The conspiracy of international capital against Russia will be avenged, but only through faith in Russia and the party can this be achieved."
 NIK_natsoc_moral_code_of_the_builder_of_ordosocialism_desc:0 "1. Loyalty to Ordosocialism, and love of the Russian Motherland.\n2.

High consciousness of the social responsibilities, and intolerance to the violation of the social interests.\n5. Collectivism and comradery: one for all, and all for the party.\n6. Humane relationships between party members: One party member is a friend, a comrade and a brother to any other follower of Ordosocialism.\n7. Honesty, ethical cleanliness, as well as simplicity and modesty both in private and public life.\n8. Mutual respect in the family, and care for the upbringing of the children.\n9. Intolerance to injustice, social parasitism, unfairness, careerism, and acquisitiveness against our own peoples.\n10. Loyalty between all the nations of the USSR to Russia\n11. Intolerance to the enemies of Russia.\n12. Brotherly solidarity to all Russians within our nation."
 NIK_natsoc_the_reawoken_consciousness_desc:0 "The new Soviet man can be described as a lot of things. He is intelligent and educated, well versed in traditional marxist-leninist literature as well as more modern Ordosocialist literature. He is watchful and vigilant, reporting to the proper authorities any misdeeds or crimes he sees. He is patriotic and nationalistic, secure in the knowledge that Russia and the Soviet Union stand higher than any other nations on this Earth. Above all else though, he is loyal, obeying the state and having full faith in Serov's wisdom and guidance. This is the new Soviet man, and you will become him, if not for patriotism, then for your life."
 NIK_natsoc_national_economy_policy_desc:0 "The former economic policy of the Soviet Union wasn't necessarily bad, it simply wasn't properly suited for military industry production, and it didn't prioritize development of the most important region of the Soviet Union, Russia, as much as it should have. We will rectify this mistake when designing our new economic policy for Russia. This time, all developmental resources will be directed towards the core Russian territory, and this development will focus on military production and construction."
 NIK_natsoc_the_tactical_prudence_desc:0 "While state ownership of military and heavy industry is both necessary and desirable for both the party and Russia, it may be beneficial for us to allow some private ownership of small businesses and land. It may be distasteful for some in the party to have to relinquish such control, but allowing the people free right to entrepreneurship and private property will help restart the economy and encourage growth. Additionally, if fears of radical ideas infecting the populace in the concern, then they should have no fear. Such entrepreneurs and small business owners will be watched very carefully."
 NIK_natsoc_the_commissars_of_industry_desc:0 "This idea of workplace democracy is both ridiculous and inefficient. While this notion of workplace democracy may satisfy the worker, it's simply terrible for maximizing productivity from a factory. Our factories will not be run in such a manner. Factories will be run just as our government is, cleanly organized and centralized with a strict hierarchy and chain of command. At the top of this chain is the industrial Commissar. He commands the factory and gives the men day to day instructions and orders. He is the lynchpin of the whole operation, and we must find men who are suitable to take these positions across the country."
 NIK_natsoc_the_national_accountability_desc:0 "The capitalist system is vile, but if nothing else, it provides great motivation for individuals to succeed. Failure in business or the economy can lead to factories closing or a man losing his job. That sort of fear of failure is excellent for motivation, and we should seek to simulate that concept cost accounting for our planned economy. Factories that don't produce as much as they should or can will be warned once. Continual failure to meet quotas will result in less and less funding, until closure if necessary. Successful factories that meet or even exceed quotas will be rewarded with more resources for them to use and expand with. These factories will be accountable for their own survival."
 NIK_natsoc_one_big_cooperative_desc:0 "Russia is a large and diverse nation, a fact only accentuated by this period of warlordism. It similarly has a large and diverse economy, with many different players and economic philosophies. Market liberalism, state capitalism, marxists planned economics, laissez faire economics, we have it all. However, this diversity of thought is a weakness. Our economic structure is the only correct one, and it would help others to understand this. To that end, we have created an economic union in which all the major economic players of our nation will work with one another. Together, they will pursue the common goals of class consciousness within our nation and work towards an economically productive tomorrow."
 NIK_natsoc_the_refined_gosplan_desc:0 "The Gosplan was the original central planning committee of the Soviet Union. It was the main driver and planning system behind the Soviet economy, existing from 1921 until it's dissolution in '45. The guiding principle behind the Gosplan was the idea of the planned economy, an avenue through which the state could control the economy and ensure prosperity and safety. We will create a new Gosplan, whose focus will be on building our military industrial complex into one of the most formidable on Earth, with productive capabilities to match. Soon, even Germany will be eclipsed by our economic might."
 NIK_natsoc_the_ordosocialist_household_desc:0 "What did the old Tsarist regime fall so many years ago? A strange question, but one worth asking. It wasn't the brutal treatment of serfs, or Tsar Nicholas' poor leadership, or even the war. In the end, it came down to bread. The people were starving, and when people are wracked with hunger at the brink of death, they will do whatever they think they have to do to fix their situation. Oftentimes, this turns into rage against the government. Agriculture must be a priority in order to avoid such a fate for our government. Farms will be collectivized under state leadership to maximise output, and the people housed in state controlled homes. The Ordosocialist household will be one of plenty."
 NIK_natsoc_the_transformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Our population is growing, and some within our government predict that we will experience a population boom now that Russia is finally stabilizing again. Soon, our nutritional needs may well surpass our capacity for production. A number of daring plans and ideas for boosting agricultural yields have been put forward in order to address the problem before it ever becomes a real issue. These plans range from clearcutting forests for more agricultural land to a plan that would divert water from rivers feeding into the Aral sea to irrigate new farmlands."
 NIK_natsoc_mending_the_industry_desc:0 "Russia's industry lies broken after so many years of bombing and internal wars. However, among the rubble lies an opportunity to create a Russia stronger than ever before. Bukharin was a fool and traitor for many reasons, but the most important was in how he handled our industry. His lack of focus on heavy industry meant that when the time came to fight, we had no factories to forge the implements with which to defend ourselves. We will not repeat his mistakes. Reconstruction and economic reorganization are already underway, and this time we will make sure that heavy industry is front and center at the core of our new economy."
 NIK_natsoc_forging_the_shield_and_sword_desc:0 "As a great man once said, "The only real power comes out the end of a long rifle". Unfortunately, Russia has a severe lack of rifles. In fact, Russia has a severe lack of almost every weapon. Tanks, planes, rifles, and artillery are all in short supply. A similar situation exists with our airfields, naval bases, and defensive fortifications. Simply put, Russia is rather weak right now, and even a relatively small invasion force from Germany could topple us. We must rectify this situation. Resources must be put towards building up our military industry to fend off would be invaders and secure our borders."
 NIK_natsoc_the_revolutionary_adventurism_desc:0 "The future of the Russian economy lies in the state. Moderate and social democrats warn against the sort of revolutionary political adventurism that we are pushing. They lack the will to fully reject the corporatist and capitalist systems of Italy and the United States. We have no such restrictions. We must continue and expand the process of nationalization in all industries. Under the government's control, we will bring Russia closer to the sort of autarkic self-sufficiency that other nations and Germany have strived towards."
 NIK_natsoc_collective_vanguardism_desc:0 "The people of Russia must understand that through our collective will, Russia can achieve anything. There is no greater expression of this collective will than the workers collective. The people, working together in thousands of collectives across Russia to form an even greater expression of the people, the state. We must spread this message to the masses. They must understand that they are the engine, the driving force, the power that has brought Russia as far as it has. So long as they believe that they are what's driving our state forward, they won't feel any need to actually seize control."
 NIK_natsoc_attack_at_the_capital_desc:0 "There can be no private property, businesses, or financial institutions in the new Russia to come. The global conspiracy of capitalist and corporatist nations plotting against us is how we fell last time. Bukharin was far too liberal with the NEP, and we cannot afford to repeat the old fool's mistakes. Private property and institutions will be seized and nationalized at once. Those who volunteer their property quickly and cooperatively will be given rewards, like government positions or a large one time payment. Those who refuse will face execution."
 NIK_natsoc_a_leap_to_the_future_desc:0 "The introduction of socialism into Russia's economy must be accelerated if we are to protect ourselves from the capitalist and corporatist nations that threaten us on all sides. The idea that we need a grace period as we transition into a planned economic setup is not only foolish, but dangerous. The longer our economy remains open to the world, the more opportunities our enemies will have to exploit our weakness. We have the means and the will to implement socialism into the economy now, and we must if we wish to protect Russia from outside forces."
 NIK_natsoc_total_mobilization_desc:0 "Total mobilization is an interesting concept. It refers to the complete and total utilization of all resources a state is capable of mobilizing. To engage in the total mobilization of a nation is to convert said nation into an engine of war, consuming men and steel and machinery alike and pumping out soldiers and rifles and tanks and planes. Many nations view total mobilization as a last resort, something to be utilized only when all else has failed. In Ordosocialism, total mobilization is an ideal, a goal to strive towards. Only through the total mobilization of all Russia has to offer can we crush the capitalist and cosmopolitan forces of the world."
 NIK_natsoc_the_red_army_reborn_desc:0 "The Red Army that once swept across Russia was one that marched with purpose and motivation. That Red Army marched to spread socialism across Russia. It is important that it is understood that the Red Army never stopped marching. That Red Army is our own today, as our army is nothing more than a continuation of the Red Army that came before it. We share the same principles, the same doctrines, and most importantly, we share a similar ideology, one that we're certain the original Red Army would have marched to had they been aware of the Ordosocialism at the time."
 NIK_natsoc_encourage_new_officers_desc:0 "While the old guard have plenty of experience and knowledge from so many wars in years past, they really aren't the kind of people we want manning our army. Many of them have sworn allegiances a dozen times over to whoever they find themselves working for at the time. Whether it be fascists, traditional communist, capitalists, it matter not to them. All that matters is their safety and comfort, and if it takes a petty allegiance, then they will gladly proclaim allegiance all day and night.\n\nThere are surely hundreds, if not thousands of young, fresh soldiers with knowledge and experience from the Unification Wars as well as the devotion and loyalty towards Ordosocialism needed to be an officer. We should begin promoting these kinds of men to officer positions."
 NIK_natsoc_reinstate_the_commissars_desc:0 "Political commissars are meant to be among the most loyal and devoted men in our military. Their job is to ensure that the soldiers in our military remain as loyal to Ordosocialism as possible. Due to our former relationship with the right, it wasn't possible to have political commissars of any particular strength or effectiveness. Now, however, with Ordosocialists firmly in control of the government, we can have real political commissars, with loyalty and drive. They will be the vanguard, fighting on the front lines with our men and making sure that treason and disloyalty towards Ordosocialism remains nothing more than a fear, and not a threat."
 NIK_natsoc_an_eye_to_our_history_desc:0 "The Unification Wars were a gruelling and savage affair, but they served well to hone our military, much like a hunter hones a knife. In the aftermath of such a bloody conflict, we've learned quite a lot, and will be modifying our doctrines based on lessons we learned. We gained experience fighting in the varying terrains of Russia, we learned better how to manage our supply lines, and most importantly, our men got real combat to train with, and we can use their experiences to continue bettering our military. All forces train to win the last war that they fought."
 NIK_natsoc_the_legacy_of_the_great_patriotic_war_desc:0 "It was always Zhukov and Voroloshilov who had the right of it when it came to military affairs. Their ideas about using mass industrialized combat combined with more traditional Russian Army tactics were revolutionary, and had they implemented those ideas earlier in the war against Germany, we very well may have pushed the Hun back, and even won. We should endeavor to implement their ideas about warfare into our doctrines in an effort to modernise our military. Zhukov and Voroloshilov were great generals, let us not waste their insights."
 NIK_natsoc_the_bleeding_tomorrow_desc:0 "All forces train to win the last war that they fought, but it's the armies that prepare for the wars of the future that find victory. Technology is advancing at a rate unprecedented in history. It wasn't twenty years ago that the helicopters and intercontinental ballistic missiles we have today seemed like nothing more than science fiction, or twenty years before that when a bomb that could destroy an entire city was but a fantasy. The moral here is that better technology is always being created, and if we don't stay up to date and informed, we're going to learn about these new technologies the hard way. We must prepare for the battlefield of tomorrow. Either we're going to be at the bleeding edge of technology, or we're going to be impaled on it."
 NIK_natsoc_lessons_from_the_red_napoleon_desc:0 "Tuchachevsky was a genius on the battlefield if there ever was one. He was a giant on the battlefield, easily among the greatest generals of the Second World War and West Russian War. His doctrine regarding discipline and battle tactics was revolutionary in an era that has all but abandoned the excellence in the field. Technology is obviously important, but it's the general, the commander, and the captain with whom the focus should lie. If we can train our men to think on their feet and come up with creative solutions to dangerous situations, then we will have succeeded. The German relies on his guns, his tanks, and his missiles to do all the work, but he never thinks. None of those things will do him any good if he doesn't realize he's already been flanked."
 NIK_natsoc_developments_on_the_kalashnikov_desc:0 "The AK-47 is one of the finest rifles to come out of Russia possibly ever. It's cheap to produce, extremely reliable, has replaceable parts, and is simple to understand and use. As it stands, the rifle is unparalleled. This needs to change. While the design is superior in every capacity compared to older rifle models, this is rather unremarkable in the history of rifle developments. The next generation of guns will always be superior to the last, and the Ak-47's excellent design today may become obsolete tomorrow. We mustn't be content to rest on our laurels while rifle technology in other nations surges ahead."
 NIK_natsoc_applied_mbt_designs_desc:0 "Designing a tank suited for our particular needs is no simple task. Not only must it be reliable enough to trudge through the muddy swamps of Western Russia during Raputitsa, but it also must be fuel efficient enough to operate for enough hours or even a few days without refuelling. Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard. Our tank technology is now decades behind that of Germany, so developing such a tank will take time. Applying what lessons we learned from the Unification Wars would serve as a starting point at the very least."
 NIK_natsoc_away_from_the_ground_desc:0 "Despite what our generals say, the Army isn't the only branch involved in warfare, and it should not be focused on exclusively. Both our Navy and Air Force are in dire need of attention. Our Air Force is but a shell of the organization it once was decades ago, and that's to say nothing of our Navy, which, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. It will take several years to bring either into any sort of military capable shape, and several more to match those of Germany or Japan. It will be expensive and time consuming, but rebuilding these branches of the military will be vital to our future success."
 NIK_natsoc_follow_golovkos_footsteps_desc:0 "Arseniy Golovko was a Soviet admiral who served in the Soviet Navy, specifically as Commander of the Red Banner Northern Fleet during the Second World War. His fleet, while small, served an important role protecting our northern waters in the White Sea. The Nazi's were never able to push with any success in the White Seas as a result of his excellent command, and his fleet even aided in a few offensives. Ultimately, we should hope to imitate his rather successful fleet. Forming a small, efficient commerce protection/raiding Northern Fleet would do us wonders in protecting northern trade during peacetime, and would protect ports and naval supply lines during wartime."
 NIK_natsoc_intelligence_on_the_field_desc:0 "Field intelligence in the military is arguably more important today than it ever has been in the past. Knowing where your enemy is and whether or not your enemy knows where you are could mean the difference between throwing a few artillery shells at the enemy and receiving a few instead. This distinction is made all the more important by the massive technological gap between us and our enemies. While we might be throwing shells at the enemy, they may see fit to launch missiles at us. Our reconnaissance ability will be vital in the wars to come, and it's important that we recognize this fact."
 NIK_natsoc_wings_over_the_motherland_desc:0 "The destruction the Luftwaffe has dealt Russia is unimaginable, by all accounts. A sustained, decade long bombing campaign indiscriminately destroying everything over a couple stories tall. The bombing campaign permanently scarred our people, and there isn't a Russian alive without a story to tell from those years. Such a thing can never be allowed to happen again. Our Air Force must become powerful enough to deter even the thought of engaging Russia in the air. Never again will our people see Luftwaffe planes over Russian skies."
 NIK_natsoc_a_new_sun_in_the_east_desc:0 "The spirit of revolution has been all but crushed worldwide. The oppressive German and Japanese regimes seek to smother anything even resembling a possible revolt or revolution. We must act as a counterbalance to their smothering effect. We will act as the sun to a seed, nourishing the revolutionary spirit and providing sustenance so that it one day might grow into a full blown revolution. A revolution to encompass the whole world, so that one day all oppressed peoples may be freed. Such a dream is a ways off, but all it takes to start is a seed and some sunlight."
 NIK_natsoc_clandestine_services_desc:0 "Russia needs a clandestine transportation and support network. Specifically, Russia needs the ability to move goods covertly. The goods can be anything, be it armaments, valuable metals, industrial machinery, it just needs to be able to send or acquire these goods surreptitiously. As our state grows more powerful, it will have greater need to be able to source items and materials without notice. The goal is to be able to call upon resources which can be plausibly deniable and difficult to source."
 NIK_natsoc_the_finnish_passage_desc:0 "Finland has a rather unique economic and political situation as far as European nations go. Finland is one of the only nations in Europe which possesses both access to the German economic bloc as well as its own independence. By permeating Finland with Russian agents, we might hopefully be able to covertly breach the German economic bloc and gain access to their markets. If we can move Russian goods in and out of Russia through Finland, we would successfully be avoiding a White Sea bottleneck as well as providing us a glimpse into the economic activities of Germany."
 NIK_natsoc_a_contest_for_bretagne_desc:0 "Bretagne is the undisputed capital of the black market underworld. Every product imaginable flows through their markets, from guns to tanks to information to people, the latter of which being the one we are most interested in. We mean people not only in the sense of Bretagnes trafficking operations which we can use to move around witnesses, agents, and other such assets, but also in the sense of access to powerful and corrupt leaders. Establishing contacts in Bretagne will help us towards this end."
 NIK_natsoc_the_swiss_connection_desc:0 "Hitler may very well have been right when he proclaimed so many years ago that the Swiss were the mortal enemies of Germany. Switzerland's global international banking system has a hand in almost every nation, from the United States to Japan to Germany. At this very moment, a network of several Swiss bank accounts are being registered in ours and several other fake names in Geneva, through which our contacts in America will begin dumping Japanese stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. This relationship with Switzerland is already having the looks of being extremely beneficial."
 NIK_natsoc_a_blueprint_for_struggle_desc:0 "Our unique ideology has put us in a rather compromising position. Most every other nation on this planet would see us fall, whether it be the national socialists in Germany, the fascists in Japan, or the capitalists in America. Thus, we must embrace a doctrine of critical support for any anti-capitalist or anti-colonialist/imperialist movements that might appear in the world.\n\nOur men in intelligence have created a standardized plan to follow in order whenever such a movement, rebellion, or revolution come to our attention. A basic blueprint to follow, which involves immediate shipments of armaments, capital, and advisors to aid in their struggle, in addition to long term volunteer deployments and international funneling of any other resources they might need. We must do everything in our power to aid these revolutions and further destabilize our enemies."
 NIK_natsoc_an_apparatus_for_liberation_desc:0 "We must turn our state into an efficient machine of worldwide resolution if we are to defeat the Capitalists and Corporatists of the world. Our state intelligence apparatus will have to ascend beyond that of a regional influencer. Our intelligence agency will itself become an international network of liberation movements and freedom fighters cooperating and coordinating under our global umbrella of support. Our global intelligence network will soon become even more influential and powerful than the CIA's."
 NIK_natsoc_saturate_the_west_desc:0 "A contingent of about 30 of our agents have recently been sent across the border into Moscowien. Their job is to make contact with anti-German activists and revolutionaries in the region. Once we've established connections with these groups, we will begin coordinating them with one another as we start moving supplies into the region. We will have our agents aid these groups in expanding and increasing recruitment. The more people we can radicalize, the better. Our ultimate goal is to prime the region to support Russia when the time comes for war with Germany, which we will attempt to do by energizing and expanding the anti-German movements in the region."
 NIK_natsoc_ensure_a_liquid_border_desc:0 "The border between Moscowien and Russia has been in flux for decades since the West Russian War. Official maps put the Moscowien-Russian border at the A-A line, despite the fact they haven't controlled Arkhangelsk since '54. Germany has more accurate internal maps, but those were further confused by the mess of warlord states whose borders with each other and Moscowien was always in flux. This liquid border made it exceptionally easy to move agents and other supplies across the border, something we've taken advantage of with some frequency.\n\nUnfortunately, since the unification of West Russia, Germany has made increasingly large scale attempts to pin down where the border is and lock it down, even contacting us for assistance. Given that it's in our best interest to continue Germany's border woes, we've made an effort to be as confusing as possible on the subject. We've had our diplomats tell Germany different information on where we believe the border to be. We've provided false information on geographical landmarks and other such locations on the border. Most impressively, we even uprooted and moved an entire border checkpoint on two occasions in order to confuse German cartographers sent to map the border. The liquid border will remain ensured."
 NIK_natsoc_pollinate_the_steppe_desc:0 "Kazakhstan and the rest of Central Asia will be invaluable allies in the future. Their position on the continent separates us from German aligned Iran and could provide us an avenue through which we could access India. We must saturate their lands with our own agents, allowing them to infiltrate their governments and orient their foreign policy towards our own ends. We should hope to, in time, have an agent at every level of government, from the low level bureaucrats to the highest level politicians."
 NIK_natsoc_split_the_separatists_desc:0 "A divided Central Asia is an easily controlled Central Asia. The larger and more unified these nations become, the greater the threat they pose Russia. Therefore we should strive to keep these nations as divided and unstable as possible. Our intelligence advisors suggest it wouldn't be too difficult to play these countries off one another, sparking border conflicts and wars to weaken their overall strength and stability. Our men already have underground supply lines funneling weapons into these countries, and should unification become inevitable, we can be assured it will be a leftist, Ordosocialist aligned nation that succeeds."
 NIK_natsoc_a_mission_abroad_desc:0 "The Middle East is a powder keg, not unlike the Balkans. There are dozens if not hundreds of insurgency and liberation movements in the area, and the already unstable nature of the region will make it easy to infiltrate, manipulate, and further destabilize. Our men have already made contact with Ba'athist liberation movements across the region, as well as Kurdish separatists specifically in northern Iraq and southern Turkey. Disrupting Middle Eastern politics and pushing it further towards civil war and unrest shouldn't give us too much difficulty."
 NIK_natsoc_of_darkest_africa_desc:0 "Of all the lands and peoples on this Earth, none have been more so oppressed and humiliated than those in Africa. Whether it be Northern Africa today under the facist boot of Italy and Iberia or Sub-Saharan Africa which has been under the imperialist, colonialist boot of Europe's various empires for hundreds of years, these people have known naught but pain and suffering. Surely among them there are men and women who would fight for their freedom and independence. Our agents in Africa have told us that there are, and that all we need to do is provide the means for them to do so. These colonies, these bastions of superpower imperialism, cannot be tolerated any longer."

 NIK_taboritsky_the_second_cleansing_desc:0 "우랄 산맥 너머, 수많은 타락한 자들이 피난처를 찾았습니다. 범죄자들, 빨갱이들, 악마 숭배자들, 그리고 주인 없는 군인들 사이에서, 열등인종들은 꽤 잘 어울립니다... 그러나 그들은 신실한 자들에게서 숨을 수 없습니다.\n\n많은 시간과 노력이 들겠지만 하나님은 우리 편입니다. 산과 숲은 피난처를 제공하지 않을 것입니다. 일단 신앙이 돌아온 순수한 시베리아인들은 분명히 우리와 함께 적을 추격할 것입니다. 우리는 이스라엘인들이 이루지 못한 것을 성취하고, 약속된 땅을 온전히 깨끗하게 할 것입니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_the_kaukasian_method_desc:0 "지금까지 우리는 재래식 오염제거 수단을 활용했습니다. 총, 칼, 가스 등등을. 불행히도, 이것들 중 특별히 효율적인 것은 없습니다. 범죄자들의 마을에서, 특히 그들이 그들 자신을 감추기 위한 조치를 취했다면, 마을을 청소하는 데는 몇 시간이 걸립니다.\n\n하지만... 다른 대안이 있을지도 모릅니다. 더 나은 방법이. 같은 결과를 얻지만, 농장, 공장, 광산의 생산량을 보강하는 추가적인 이점이 있는 방법이. 타락한 자의 삶은 가치가 없지만, 그의 노동은 그렇지 않을지도 모릅니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_define_subhumanity_desc:0 "우리가 권력을 잡은 이후, 우리는 오직 섭정의 직접적인 명령에만 의존해 왔습니다. 불순함에 대한 성전에서 말이죠. 열등인종에 관한 대부분의 정책은 비공식적이며, 우리 군대가 단지 준군사적이었던 시절의 오래된 격언에 근거하고있습니다. 이건... 가장 효율적인 시스템이 아닙니다.\n\n섭정은 이러한 상황이 우리에게 준 어려움을 알게 되었고, 즉시 개선하겠다고 정중히 선언하였습니다. 그가 그의 신성한 작품이라고 이름 붙인 제국 순수 인종 목록은 신이 선택한 사람들에게 천국으로 가는 길을 보여줄 것입니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_chemical_terror_bombing_desc:0 "섭정의 많은 신하들이 아직도 독일군의 우리 고국에 대한 지속적인 폭격에 대해 분개하고 있습니다. 물론, 독일인들이 그것으로 비난받을 수 없습니다. 러시아 사람들이 하나님을 신뢰하고 더 일찍 섭정에게 헌신했다면, 아마도 그는 그들을 고통으로부터 구해줄 수 있는 방법을 보았을 것입니다!\n\n언제나 그렇듯이, 복받은 섭정은 그 문제에 대해 좀 더 미묘한 이해를 하고 있습니다. 폭격은 러시아인들을 신으로 돌아오게 하려는 의도였을 수도 있지만, 이미 깨달은 사람들에겐 영감을 주기위한 것입니다. 이 죄 많은 땅 위에서 축복받은 정화를 수행하는 최신예 제트 폭격기들은 독일의 전술과 러시아의 신앙의 융합체입니다! 그 어떤 시베리아의 불성실한 마을이나 오염된 도시도 우리의 신성한 무기의 손길이 미치지 않는 곳은 없을 것입니다!"
 NIK_taboritsky_cleanliness_is_godliness_desc:0 "러시아의 가난한 사람들은 예수 그리스도가 말한 가난한 사람들이 아닙니다. 진정 가난한 자들은 순수한 민족이지만 그러한 지위가 마땅히 누려야 할 것이 없는 사람들입니다. 그리스도는 우리가 우리의 거리를 더럽히는 더러운 대중들에게 하려는 일을 찬성하실 것입니다.\n\n복된 섭정이 설명했듯이, 진실은 가난한 사람들은 너무 오랫동안 심판에서 벗어난 타락한 짐승들일 뿐입니다. 불경함이나 유대인에 의한 전복 외에 그들이 처한 곤경에 대해 어떤 설명이 있을 수 있을까요? 섭정은 제국의 신성함을 위협하는 다른 어떤 해충들에게 하는것과 마찬가지로 어떻게 해야 하는지를 정확히 알고 있습니다!"
 NIK_taboritsky_fires_of_redemption_desc:0 "신과 제국에 대한 범죄로 볼 때 신성모독만큼 극악무도한 것은 거의 없습니다. 그리하여 여호와께서 이르시기를 "사람들이 어떤 죄를 짓거나 모독하는 말을 하더라도 그것은 다 용서받을 수 있지만 성령을 거슬러 모독한 죄만은 용서받지 못할 것이다."\n\n과거에, 신을 두려워하는 모든 러시아인들은 이 중죄에 대한 올바른 처벌을 알고 있었습니다. 타락한 현대성이 도래하면서 신앙이 흔들리기 시작하자, 그들은 어리석게도 가장 검은 죄악 앞에서 마음을 굳히려 하지 않고 그것을 버렸습니다. 섭정은 우리가 더 이상 신성모독의 악을 용납하지 않겠다고 맹세했습니다. 적절한 처벌은 즉시 다시 도입될 것입니다. 그리하여 우리는 주님을 찬양합니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_salvation_through_sacrifice_desc:0 "성스러운 러시아는 다른 나라들처럼 위협에 직면해 있습니다. 수 세기 동안, 열등인종의 위협은 우리의 경건한 문명의 기초를 갉아먹었습니다. 유대인들은 부패한 마음을 가지고 있고, 타타르인들은 우리 민족을 학살하고, 믈라도로시는 기회가 있을 때마다 우리를 배반합니다.\n\n그들의 침입은 암적인 벌집처럼 깊숙히 뻗어 있습니다. 볼셰비키와 자유주의자들은 그들이 러시아에 '필수적'이라고 생각하고, 끊임없이 그들의 환심을 사려고 애씁니다. 한손으로 다른 이들과 친분을 맺을때 다른 손으로 칼을 등뒤에 숨기고 있는 자들에게 말이죠. 그들은 너무 오랫동안 순수한 인종 사이에서 전파되어 왔기 때문에 종종 우리와 구별할 수 없는 것처럼 보입니다. 작은 사람들은 이 상황에 절망할 수도 있지만, 섭정은 그렇지 않으실 것입니다. 하나님 자신이 그에게 말씀하시며, 진실을 밝히셨습니다. 순결을 추구하는 과정에서 잃어버리는 무고한 삶은 없을 것입니다. 불확실성에 직면하면, 그들 모두를 죽여라. 하나님은 자신의 것을 아실 것이다."
 NIK_taboritsky_the_war_within_desc:0 "반역은 나무와 같습니다. 초록색이고 생명으로 가득 찬 그것의 잎들은 바람에 부드럽게 흔들고 목가적인 그림을 그리지만, 흙 밑에서는 그 뿌리가 전염병처럼 퍼져나가 그들이 만지는 모든 것을 썩게 합니다. 제아무리 순수한 러시아인이라 할지라도 그 더러운 감염에 면역이 되지는 않는 것 같습니다...\n\n그들은 그들의 집, 거리, 교회에 모입니다. 그들은 복된 섭정을 모독하고, 믿을 수 없는 일로, 그를 폭군이자 이단자라고 비난합니다! 심지어 우리 자신의 거룩한 사람들까지도 유대인에게서 전복되어 섭정을 새로운 안티오코스 에피파네스라고 비난하고 있습니다! 우리 민족이 어떻게 그렇게 쉽게 타락할 수 있었는지 모르지만, 이 유대인의 악행은 즉시 정화되어야만 합니다!"
 NIK_taboritsky_the_false_shepherds_desc:0 ""너희 바리새파 사람들은 화를 입을 것이다. 너희는 회당에서는 높은 자리를 즐겨 찾고 장터에서는 인사받기를 좋아한다." 이와 같이 주님께서 말씀하셨습니다. 우리가 그의 말에 주의를 기울였더라면 좋았을 텐데요! 성직자들에게 목이 하나밖에 없는것이 우리가 그들의 목을 조르기 위해 있는걸까요!\n\n사제들, 수녀들, 수도승들. 그들은 감히 공언할 만큼 충성스럽지 않았습니다. 그들의 마음은 반역, 이단, 유대인에 대한 동조로 가득 차 있습니다. 그들이 처음에 신성 러시아의 정화를 방해했을 때 우리는 그들의 악의 깊이를 알았어야 했습니다. 신부의 대가는 얼마죠? 거룩한 사람을 하나님을 거역하게 만드는 데 은 셰켈이 얼마나 들까요? 우리가 사탄의 부패에서 벗어나기 위해서 성직자의 피를 흘려야 한다 하더라도 이 문제를 바로잡을 것입니다!"
 NIK_taboritsky_rats_in_the_walls_desc:0 "최근의 뉴스를 고려할 때 바퀴벌레와 비교하는 것은 열등인종을 묘사하는데 가장 적절할 것입니다! 우리는 시투르모비키가 그들의 지휘관들이 주장한 것만큼 그렇게 능력이 있지 않다는 것을 배웠습니다. 수많은 유대인, 타락한 자들, 반역자, 그리고 다른 해충들이 그들을 피해 탈출했습니다! 설상가상으로, 그들은 순수한 종족인 충성스러운 우리 형제들에 의해 보호되고 있다고 합니다!\n\n섭정의 백성, 즉 신이 택하신 민족이 이렇게 철저하게 타락했다는 것은 믿을 수 없는 일입니다. 이것 또한 루시퍼의 짓일까요? 다른 설명이 뭐가 있을까요? 섭정에게는 오류가 없습니다! 이유가 무엇이든, 우리는 칼을 들고 이 도전에 응해야 합니다! 거짓말을 하고 있는 시투르모비키를 처형하고, 우리의 노력을 배가시키고, 우리가 발견한 유대인의 동조자들에게 신속하고 치명적인 정의를 내려 줍시다!"
 NIK_taboritsky_the_purity_order_desc:0 "다시는 교회를 믿을 수 없습니다. 심지어 주교와 대제사장들도 유대인의 금과 사탄의 권력에 대한 약속에 의해 반역자로 변질되었습니다. 유일한 해결책은, 시계를 되돌리기 위해선, 썩은 구조물을 무너뜨리는 것, 그리고 그것들을 모두 태워버리는 것입니다.\n\n복된 섭정은 새로운 성 베드로가 될 것입니다. 즉, 새롭고 순수한 교회가 세워지기 위한 반석이 될 것입니다. 이 과정의 첫 번째 단계는 우리의 거룩한 사람들의 충성을 보장하여, 또 다른 대숙청이 필요하지 않도록 하는 것입니다. 이것을 위해 필요한 것은 시투르모비키에서 가장 충성스러운 이들에게서 차출한 몇 명의 선량한 사람들입니다. 이 '순수 기사단'은 사찰을 수행하고, 지역 사제들에게 지침을 제공하며, 교회 의무 참석을 집행할 것입니다. 진정한 신앙은 아직 사라지지 않았습니다!"
 NIK_taboritsky_no_such_thing_as_innocence_desc:0 "섭정의 축복 중에는 주님의 전지전능함의 일부도 있습니다. 그는 사람의 마음을 알고, 선택받은 하인들에게 이 지식을 전합니다. 제국 법정앞에 세워진 이들은 누구도 죄에서 자유롭지 않습니다. 그들의 피속은 배반과 이단으로 장식되어있죠.\n\n그러므로 우리 법정에서 무죄를 주장하는 것은 곧 피고가 저지른 다른 범죄들과 함께 우리의 시간을 낭비하게 만든 죄입니다. 우리의 사법체계는 하나님 자신으로부터 직접 지도받기에 '적법한 절차' 따위는 필요하지 않습니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_villages_of_the_damned_desc:0 "사도 교회의 전통적인 위계질서가 시험받았고 이들은 부족한 것으로 밝혀졌습니다. 복된 섭정에게 충성을 맹세했던 주교들은 사실은 반역자였으며, 재탄생된 우리 제국의 토대를 허물기 위해 은밀히 활동했습니다. 사탄의 뱀 같은 영혼이 그들의 마음속에 숨어 있습니다. 이런 사악함을 치료할 수 있는 방법은 단 한 가지입니다.\n\n우리의 정의로운 정화가 남긴 공백을 메우기 위해서는 주교 대신 새롭고 순수한 마음을 가진 사람을 승진시켜야 할 것입니다. 교회가 이렇게 철저하게 타락한 상태에서는 아무리 천한 사람이라도 믿을 수 없습니다. 오직 섭정께서 손수 뽑으신 신하만이 주님의 양떼를 모시는 책임을 질 만할 것입니다. 그분의 말씀은 하나님의 말씀이며, 하나님은 그의 교회를 위해 무엇이 최선인지를 아십니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_the_wages_of_sin_desc:0 "로마서 6:23 - "죄의 대가는 죽음이다."\n\n우리는 자비에 지쳤습니다. 우리는 그들의 범죄가 경미하다고 판단되었기 때문에 반역자들이 풀려나는 것에 지쳤습니다. 우리는 사형 집행인의 칼날을 유대인에 목에 내리치려 하지않는 희미한 마음에 사로잡힌 우리의 병사들에게 지쳤습니다. 우리는 우리 내면의 의심하는 자, 반대자, 선동가들이 우리 등 뒤에서 배반과 일탈을 속삭이는 것에 지쳤습니다. 그러나 그들은 여전히 우리에게 자비를 요구합니다. 악마는 그의 목적에 경전을 인용합니다.\n\n죽음은 자비입니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_empire_eternal_desc:0 "신성 러시아야말로 진정한 지구상의 신의 왕국입니다. 우리는 주님의 은총에 의해 보존된, 난공불락의 존재입니다. 우리의 영광 앞에 오래된 이스라엘도 머리를 조아립니다!\n\n인간이 우리를 위협할 수 있는 것은 아무것도 없습니다. 어떤 무기도 우리를 쓰러뜨릴 수 없고, 어떤 병도 우리의 섭정을 빼앗을 수 없으며, 어떤 장애물도 차레비치를 찾으려는 우리의 탐구를 방해할 수 없습니다. 그는 살아있습니다! 우리는 살아있습니다! 신성 러시아는 이 비좁은 땅 위에 서있는 유일한 순수한 국가이며, 언제나 그래왔고, 항상 그러할 것입니다!"

 NIK_taboritsky_new_concoctions_desc:0 "포스진, 머스타드 가스, 사린은 모두 우리 무기에 있어서 유능하고 유용한 도구입니다. 이런 기발한 화학무기로 도시 전체를 제압하고 수천 마리의 시끄러운 기생충들을 박멸하였습니다.\n\n섭정은 더 많은 치명적인 비밀들이 발견될 것이라고 믿고, 화학자들과 기술자들에게 즉시 실험을 시작하라고 명령했습니다. 많은 자료들이 준비되어 있습니다. 그리고 지식을 제공할 준비가 된 많은 지식인들도 있습니다..."

 NIK_taboritsky_the_spark_desc:0 "최근 우리는 섭정에게 깊은 호기심을 불러일으키고 있는 특정 요소들이 우리 영토에 존재한다는 것을 깨우치게 되었습니다. 우라늄은 비교적 풍부한 방사성 물질로, 이전에 우리가 도달하지 못했던 것의 기초 역할을 해줍니다. 바로 원자력입니다.\n\n섭정은 그의 가장 충실한 신하가 그렇듯이 확실히 흥분하고 들떠있습니다. 그는 많은 수의 노예들과 모든 필수 장비들을 가장 많은 매장량이 발견된 옴스크로 이동시키도록 지시했습니다. 오늘, 우리는 궁극적인 무기를 획득하기 위한 첫걸음을 내딛습니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_recover_lost_knowledge_desc:0 "볼셰비키들은 아마도 대량 학살당한 유태인 지배자들의 재촉에 따라 독일군의 침략 전에 원자력을 실험하고 있었던 것으로 전해지고 있습니다. 우리는 독일보다 먼저 그들이나 서방이 그런 권력을 획득하지 못한 것에 대해 하나님께 감사해야 합니다! 소련 붕괴의 결과, 핵 프로그램에 관련된 과학자들은 바람속에 흩어지고 일부는 섭정의 신하들 사이에 숨어 있는 것으로 밝혀졌습니다.\n\n그들의 지식은 어떤식으로든 우리의 손 안에 들어올 것입니다. 과학자들은 심문을 견뎌낼 의지가 없는 연약하고 나약한 사람들입니다. 만약 그들이 우리를 위해 일하지 않는다면, 우리는 적어도 그들의 더 충성스러운 동료들을 교육하는 데 필요한 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다."
 NIK_taboritsky_skyward_swords_desc:0 "원거리에서 신의 형벌을 내리는 것은 아름다운 일입니다. 독일인, 일본인, 그리고 미국인들은 모두 순식간에 서로를 파괴할 수 있는 능력을 가지고 있습니다. 그들은 각각 핵 미사일의 무기고를 가지고 있고, 이 무기고들이 결합되면 원자탄의 폭풍 속에서 전 대륙을 파괴할 수 있습니다. 반대하는 주장에도 불구하고, 그들은 화학 물질과 생물학적 물질을 전달하기 위한 유사한 시스템을 가지고 있을 것입니다.\n\n우리의 로켓 발사 프로그램이 우선시 될 것입니다. 적절한 자금과 자원으로, 우리는 국가 전체를 죽음의 독구름으로 뒤덮을 수 있는 무기고를 건설할 수 있을 것입니다."

 NIK_shafarevich_the_great_uniter_desc:0 "Every century or so the Russian nation produces a political genius - at even rarer intervals than that, Russia births a unifier, a leader who can embody and guard the values of the Motherland at its time of greatest need. For every Time of Troubles, an Ivan the Great: for every Napoleon, a Catherine. The time of the Unifier is again at hand, and its harbinger is Igor Shafarevich.\n\nShafarevich will build his nation neither on the false pietisms of the Fascists nor the moral degradation of the Leftists - Russia will be shaped by what has always made it great, the purity of its soil and the refined disposition of its people. Only a Moral Russia can be a strong Russia, and only a strong Russia can be great. We will find the will to cast those parasites who impede us in this mission, and God help us, when freedom shines once more upon the Rodina it will be a true and lasting one."
 NIK_shafarevich_national_democracy_desc:0 " We are the Party of the Masses, but if we do not uphold the voice of the Russian people we are no better than the petty tyrants who claimed the same title. We will fashion from this rough clay a new and lasting Democracy, one that encompasses the breadth of our domain and its peoples - and, as with every careful potter, we will take care to dispose of any excess or spoiled materials before our work is complete.\n\nWe will institute new democratic campaigns across the rural network, calling for mass political participation and voting rallies, but our bureaucracy will take the greatest of pains to ensure that external elements - the old enemies of Russia - will not infiltrate this expression of our greatest values. Glory to Russia! May our freedom stand forever untainted!"
 NIK_shafarevich_election_security_act_desc:0 "There is something to be said about our dedication to rural democracy - there is also something to be said about the vulnerability of said democracy to infiltration by... unsavory elements. Words, however, are easy. We must set our minds to action, and preserve the voice of the Rodina in its most honest and direct form - rooting out every stray voice that does not truly have the Motherland at heart!\n\nThe Security Act being drafted will go a long way towards our goals in both directions. Formal agencies will be directed to reorganize our election structure from the bottom up, accountable to the highest legislative bodies in the land, and for those who are deemed suspicious in background, well, democracy is a vital and fragile instrument, yes? We cannot afford to take chances."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_spiritual_hegemony_desc:0 "Long have we dealt with the people of the Western Siberian despotates, and long have we awaited their return to the fold. Shafarevich is convinced that an approach of generosity and benevolence is what will work best for the good of the Nation as a whole; at all possible times we will forestall the use of violence and attempt instead to reinforce our common interests. There is much to be gained by accepting our rulership, and at the end of the day we are all Russians.\n\nHowever, should they refuse...§Rspecial measures§! will have to be taken to make these wayward children see sense."
 NIK_shafarevich_a_generation_of_thinkers_desc:0 "Russia is a field. This field is watered infrequently, and occasionally parts of it burn down at the behest of others, but the result is a stronger and more beautiful harvest. This is also true for Russia's vast landscape of intellectual talent - for every difficulty the peasantry have faced, they have overcome with flying colors. This, then, is our goal: to find the strongest and best flowers in our garden, nurture them into brilliant life, and set them loose to transform the world around them.\n\nWe will overhaul our recruitment structure in both Party and Government, setting the absolute highest standards of education and training, and when we are done our nation will be led by the cream of the Russian crop. The beautiful, the brave, the sensitive and the strong - they say the Superman will emerge from Berlin, but our rebuttal will be crafted here in Russia."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_most_loyal_opposition_desc:0 "The Russian spirit is renowned for its boundless enthusiasm, and for its absolute integrity. Long have these impulses served us, and long have they sown fertile rewards in artistic and scientific innovation. But there are instances in which one clashes with the other - so too for our opposition, noble in their enthusiasm but with their integrity tilted askew. It falls to us to ensure that they are curbed in the worst of their excesses, so that we will have a firm and unquestioned hand in guiding this country to the common good.\n\nWe will, through quiet words and unquiet actions, move our Opposition into positions of ceremonial power and no real value, while we place pressure upon their leadership to follow the will of the Russian state (its voice being, of course, Shafarevich). The Opposition may not always agree with us, but with our gentle directions, we will ensure that they will follow our lead even in wilfulness."
 NIK_shafarevich_return_to_the_soil_desc:0 "So much has been made of our dedication to rural democracy - perhaps we have forgotten that the farmer thinks of voting only as an afterthought. His life is dominated by simpler, rougher and better things - the harvest, the village and the family. As we polish our democratic processes, cast out the problematic elements haunting us and open the ballot boxes, let us celebrate as if there were neither peasant nor workingman, only Russians!\n\nThe Russian Spirit will be fostered as we turn electoral cycles into literal cycles of life, akin to harvests - rural-cultural dancing, movie screenings, and outright celebrations of life will follow each ballot, and our Churches will fill with joy as priests speak of the noble perfection of the Russian life. It will be a life of beauty and of honest work - all of Russia will share in its joy!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_national_self_sufficiency_desc:0 "In the time of the Tsars Russia was accused of rapaciousness, even robbery, in its treatment of the nations under its wing. It was said that the Government favoured the death of ten indigenous residents to the impoverishment of a single Russian. Those days are long gone now, and the Empire is a fading memory, but the problem the Tsars faced has been handed over to us. What approach shall we take to preserve our national essence, while remaining faithful stewards of the people God has granted us dominion over?\n\nShafarevich believes he has the solution: an approach he calls Self-Sufficiency, wherein the non-Russian national communities shall see neither incorporation nor exploitation. Instead the Russian nation shall focus on enriching its people, and the minorities within it can go their own way - they will be blessedly, truly free of the hands of the State, now and forever."
 NIK_shafarevich_bond_the_countryside_desc:0 "We must never forget the rural roots of Russian life, and to abandon them to the ravages of industrial monstrosity would be utterly immoral of us. Instead we will focus on the true aims of any government worth its salt - allowing the fertile soil of Russian peasantry to take root and blossom into fecundity.\n\nOf course, that does not mean the state is entirely irrelevant: far from it, our new Russian Agrarianism policies will ensure that the state will forever be joined at the hip to the farmer! From investment in rural production methods to the sending of agricultural advisors, from bureaus to tractors to roads, the Russian State will experience rebirth where it was born at the first."
 NIK_shafarevich_farewell_to_arcadia_desc:0 "We do not make this decision lightly - it is with the bitterest of regrets - but for the Rodina to rebuild some compromises must be made, no matter the cost. Just as trees survive better with the cutting of branches when the forest fires come, so too shall Russia's industrial abominations, expansive though they might be, save us from the inferno of war.\n\nWe will invest in industrial and heavy-mining concerns in areas that are sparsely populated, boosting our private industry at the cost of some of our cultural purity. It might be a betrayal of our values. It might even be considered oppressive. With our diplomatic threats coming closer every day, however, this investment will come in handy sooner or later. We would prefer to wield it of our own volition, rather than have it foisted upon us."
 NIK_shafarevich_russias_beating_heart_desc:0 "As the firms, the farmers and the factories of the Motherland grow into each other, the Nation comes closer to the platonic ideal of a united series of tissues. Yes, Russia is one giant organ of life and common purpose, and what a glorious shared purpose it is! We must not rest easy, however: the people must always be guarded from their worst impulses, not to mention those germs who would wish to defile what we have built here and turn it to their own ends.\n\nContinual incremental adjustments to this system, developing new methods to manage Russian ruralities and building a strong culture of self-reliance amongst our peasantry will ensure that this self-sustaining system continues to grow and self-correct. May all of Russia embrace this organic life, and may it sustain a vital Nation far into the future!"
 NIK_shafarevich_promote_russian_traditions_desc:0 "In the lands under our hegemony, many mansions claim dominion over the Russian heart. Some of them are of Socialist origin, some of Monarchist roots, and some stem from foreign influences. There will be more in the days to come, but if we are to expel these wayward ideas we must build something of substance in its place. The Russian Glory must be on full display for its light to enlighten our people! Nothing less is acceptable!\n\nWe will focus on the development of the rituals that tie us to the soil, and to the Nation: national holidays are only the beginning of a full-scale revamp of our civic culture. Religious occasions, national commemorations of martyrs and the enforcement of Russian language and history will ensure that the light of the Rus shines far brighter than the darkness which would put it out!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_counter_russophobic_campaign_desc:0 "In recent days some have spoken of those with a sinister vision for Russia - they speak of the demon of "multiculturalism", where tolerance of those different from us is is interchangeable from the blending of pure Russian culture with incompatible, alien substances! It is utter nonsense to believe such things, of course, but the nonsense is potent nonetheless. If we are to combat this stupidity we must start from the ground of Russian society - the peasantry.\n\nIn truth, many Russian ruralities have an unrealised, nebulous notion of what it means to be Russian. By affirming their God-given sense of what is Russian and what is from the Devil, we will reinforce the notion that a half-hearted embrace of minority culture, of the loss of the heritage of earth and blood, is Russophobia in its most demonic form. And when we set these people loose upon the cities, we hope the ivory-tower elites who speak above their station will learn that lesson, too."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_politically_conscious_army_desc:0 "Glory is in the Russian blood - our people were made for greatness, and the Army is the distillation of the finest traditions of our people. Honor! Courage! Integrity! Patriotism! These values thrive everywhere, but they blossom into view only in the men who have selflessly volunteered for the greatest of all possible lives. What better way to ensure the spirit of our National Revival never dies out than to build it into the Army?\n\nRegular political re-education lessons, the stacking of leadership positions with firm loyalists dedicated to the Passionariyy ideals, and an emphasis on rural strength will keep the Army forever loyal to our ideals and our vision for the nation. Quiet amendments to the Constitution will also ensure that should our leadership ever come into question, the soldiers know exactly where their interests lie."
 NIK_shafarevich_from_sea_to_shining_sea_desc:0 "This, then, is the dream: nothing more, nothing less than the bringing to wholeness of Holy Russia. Even as the Union fell, even as the barbarities consumed so much of Russian life and culture, we held on to this dream. The time has come when we shall bring it into being - so with our Army ready to roll the false-kulturny ideas that pollute Russia all the way back to Germania, let us be fearless!\n\nThere is a home for us, a place where the people most precious of God shall ever rest: that place is the heart of the Father in heaven, and the Holy Mother Rus on earth!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_russian_idea_desc:0 "Again and again, civilization has risen, again and again it has collapsed, and again and again, Russia has taken its remnants into our loving arms. When Orthodoxy burned with Constantinople, we took the mantle of the new Rome without question. When the liberalists burnt Europe half to the ground, we in Russia took the mantle of tradition. Now that the Germanic savages hold Russian soil and people hostage, we shall again assume the mantle of those who know they are the last redoubt - for that is what we are.\n\nBut let us never cower before the enemy! Our long march to the Baltics, to the Urals, has brought with it the Russian Idea - the vitality and the beauty and the wild strength of Russian life - everywhere our boots have landed. Again I tell you: as long as we hold the Rodina within our hearts, in our minds and with every harvest, Russia can never fall! We are unconquered, unconquerable, and in the long war with savagery, there has been one certain truth:\n\n§RWe have won every single time. We will win this time, too.§!"

"표트르," 타보리츠키는 다가가면서 채워진 보드카 잔을 들고 말했습니다. 그의 우아하고 침착한 동작은 표트르에게 그의 안에 있는 당장에라도 폭발할 것 같은 광기를 잠시동안 잊게 했습니다. "같이 한잔하지 않겠나?"\n\n뻔히 보이는 계략이었습니다. 표트르는 타보리츠키와 눈을 마주치지 않았습니다. 그는 대답할 겨를도 없이 고개를 저었습니다.\n\n타보리츠키의 미소는 사라지고, 표트르가 악몽 속에서 보았던 무표정한 죽은 눈동자의 시선으로 대체되었습니다. 그들이 나보코프에게 파견될 때 그의 용모를 돋보이게 했던 것과 같은 표정이었습니다. 그가 처음 화학무기를 풀라고 명령했을 때와 같은 모습이었습니다. 하지만, 어쩌면... "폐하," 표트르는 약간 긴장을 풀며 시작했습니다. "제가.."\n\n모든 일이 한꺼번에 일어났습니다. 표트르는 광택이 나는 마룻바닥에 유리잔이 떨어져 산산조각이 나는 것을 보고 본능적으로 뒤쪽으로 홱 돌아섰습니다. 타보리츠키는 오른손에 광택이 나는 강철을 쥐고 앞으로 도약하는 것 같았습니다. 표트르는 반사적으로 경종을 울리며 재킷 주머니 안에서 권총을 꺼내려고 했습니다. 다만 권총은 덜커덩 소리를 내며 바닥에 떨어질 뿐이었습니다. 그가 할 수 있는 일은 그의 칼을 쥔 팔목을 잡고 타보리츠키를 향해 팔을 바깥쪽으로 던지는 것 밖에 없었습니다.\n\n두 사람 모두 늙어 삐걱거리는 러시아의 과거의 유물이지만 표트르쪽이 더 약했습니다. 1초도 지나지 않아, 그는 팔꿈치에 뭔가가 떨어지는 것을 느꼈고, 칼은 더 가까이 다가왔습니다. 그 순간, 그의 작은 용기가 증발해버려 그저 횡설수설하는 것으로 대체되었고, 그는 삶에 대한 공포를 느꼈습니다. "세르게이, 세르게이, 세르게이!" 목이 터져라 소리를 질렀습니다. "세르게이, 그만! 멈춰! 세르게이, 제발! 잠깐 내... 내말 좀 들어봐, 세르게이!"\n\n그의 간청에도 불구하고 친구의 눈에는 자비의 기미가 보이지 않았습니다. 광채가 나는 지점은 미친 사람의 힘에 자극되어 더 가까이 다가왔습니다. 표트르는 이를 악물고 눈을 부릅뜨고 그의 오래된 뼈에서 마지막 힘을 짜내려 애쓰다가, 미끄러졌습니다. 표트르의 갈비뼈 사이로 차가운 무언가가 미끄러지듯이 움직였습니다. 그는 먼저 벽에 부딪혔다가 바닥으로 쓰러졌습니다. 시야가 좁아지면서 그가 마지막으로 본 것은 그의 오랜 친구의 떨리는 부츠를 향해 조금씩 조금씩 퍼지는 그의 피의 웅덩이 였습니다."

Who were the Workers, anyway? What scientific method could be used to delineate the proletarian from the oppressor, the innovative from the parasitic - the good from the damned? And what did it mean to give these Proletarians, if that was indeed their true name, the means of production? Would the committees be run by the elite, who after all were used to power, or to unsteady newbies whose enthusiasm far outstripped their experience?\n\nNot to mention the matter of who the Enemy was, of course. Oh, everyone knew there was an Enemy: the propaganda rang true, and the paranoia was fresh and bright as the smell of blood in the winter snow. They lurked behind every doorway, their subtle strings tugging at the Russian heart, angling innocents into complacency, parasitism. Sin.\n\nThe question remained, unanswered and unanswerable, a dagger at the heart of Serov's movement. Who was the Enemy? And if they were a class in a classless society, both of which the Marxists were adamant about, how could one ever tell an Enemy from a friend?\n\nIn the end it simply wasn't worth the trouble, fighting over a deafening void and a slowly collapsing loyalty to a silent leader. The Passionariyy elements seemed to fall away all at once from the base Serov used to pummel legislation through the Assembly, as if some invisible chain had been lifted, and it was clear that something fundamental had changed in the Republic.\n\nLike most divorces, it was quiet at the end.

He had spoken of a future with land, bread and solidarity for all, and unlike the others he seemed to believe in the peace he spoke of. It was all catnip for Lavov, who'd hated the sight of guns since his father perished in the fall of the Union. The errant rabble who called themselves the Left hadn't been any more convincing than the drooling reactionaries they opposed on this point: all and sundry seemed determined to march into the sunset, toting a gun on one hand and their enemies' skulls on the other.\n\nOnly General Secretary Serov had promised true peace, true unity. And Lavov knew, with all the quiet absolution of a true believer, that Serov would deliver.\n\nAnd he had, hadn't he? The People's Provisions Package was blared on every loudspeaker in the country, inviting the true sons of Russian soil to take what was owed them. Minimum wage, healthcare benefits, even what they called Unionists without Unions - all could be claimed with the verification of citizenship. The Red Plenty was here, and Lavov was relishing every minute of it.\n\nHis queue number echoed from the receptionist's table.

Precious little time could be afforded for the frivolity of mass gatherings, certainly not in the present circumstances. But some things were unavoidable, and important enough for the Party to address - so a working holiday was declared and the various Congresses and the Workers' Councils convened.\n\nSerov gazed at them. Talent, certainly, but unpolished. Blunt and dull, like steel that had been left in dank air too long - edgeless. It would take work to weave them all into a knife worth wielding, and if he wanted to succeed, he would have to start now.\n\nHe asked the simple question, left it hanging in the air like a noose, an invitation. "Does anyone know what their superiors have done this last month? Their subordinates?"\n\nInto the deafening void that followed it, he began to drill the principle of mutual knowledge - over and over, just like he'd been taught by the Academy - into their heads. Simple, repetitive motion. It was almost like the conditioning techniques his commanders had speculated about using. This time, however, there would be no time for trial runs.\n\nSerov began his next move. Raising a piece of paper, he began to read names: the loud, the outspoken, the complainers and the whiners and the fearful. They were, he said, welcome to leave - but should they stay, they would be honed into something better. Something greater. Demotions, of course, would follow, even revolutionary criticism. But the new departments would be livelier than ever - and the vitality that swarmed through the Party would be one of unity, not swarming fragmentation.\n\nThey would learn to love it, this unity.

The old Soviet Union had been too weak, too divided. The old Soviet Union sacrificed so much, for so little gain. Serov and his government would remedy these mistakes, and the new Soviet Union would emerge from the ashes stronger than ever before.\n\nOne of the greatest weaknesses of the old Soviet Union was its federalized structure. The bureaucracy became bloated, and local governments were given far too much autonomy. One only has to look at what Kaganovich did with Western Siberia to see why that was a mistake. Serov's new Soviet Union would be unitary in structure. Local governments would be a mere stepping stone between the people and the capital, and all major decisions would go through the central administration first. The unitary structure proved its efficacy in World War II, with the strong, united Japanese and Germans defeating the fractured Americans. The same unitary structure would be applied to any formerly autonomous administrations, as giving the minorities their own identity merely weakened the Union's cohesion.\n\nThe Soviet Union was a Russian invention, and yet Bukharin sacrificed so much to try and please the other peoples within its borders. The Ukrainians, Belarusians, the Baltics, and the Turks, they did not answer directly to the capital, and therefore did not identify truly with Moscow. In the end, their loyalty failed us when it mattered most, and proves that they can't be trusted with the same freedoms Bukharin afforded them.

It was a game, Serov thought, a high-stakes game for the future itself. And the time had come to pick his allies.\n\nThe old cults of Taboritsky, Shafarevich and Gumilyov lurked in his base still. He knew, staring at those politely clapping for the latest speaker, that they could never be trusted with the will of the people - they barely trusted him at the best of times. He was always dancing on eggshells, hiding his real beliefs under a constantly shifting series of dogwhistles and promises of "right unity". Where had that gotten him? A place in the most unstable chair in Russia, and a mandate he burned to fulfill but struggled to speak aloud.\n\nHe looked across now to the ones he'd left behind. The Leftists, skulking about in the shadows of the Assembly, always determined to develop the ideas and never firm enough to put them into practice. He admired their innovation, but not their damnable lily-livered principles. Even so, there were - assets - to be found there. People he remembered from his old days with Suslov.\n\nHe could dogwhistle very well to the Right. He'd gotten so very good at it - but they weren't the only fish in the sea, were they?\n\nAt a polite cough the speaker gave way, and Serov took the floor.

It would join the others in the bin soon enough - damn the Passionariyy and their "internal discipline" habits! Hadn't it been enough that he'd enthusiastically dogwhistled to their basest, most irritatingly capitalist desires to gain a seat at the table? Now his hands were tied and his mouth was stoppered, just at the moment when his triumph was supposed to be full and complete.\n\nWell, at least this treatise on the 'Rights Of The Sovereign Nation' was complete. What an incoherent jumble of ultra-nationalistic sentiment it was! But it had been the only way to make the idea acceptable to both his conscience and the appetites of the Passionariyy. Moving to the 'Internal Enemies' section, however...that was promising in a way mere centralism had never been.\n\nYes, if there was one thing Serov knew best in his long years of serving the Republican Left, it was the rooting out of enemies - and the many ways one developed of finding them.

The only thing the latter had optimised, Sergei thought bitterly, had been his unwillingness to spend more than was absolutely necessary on lunch-rations.\n\nWhatever this new Factory Control Measure was, he didn't like it either. Welding was a serious business - his friends could get hurt by the inhuman standards the Quotas were dictating. He made a mental note to speak to the Overseers the State had appointed; at least the one assigned to his Factory seemed friendly enough.\n\nAs the work-day dragged to its close, Sergei slipped off the assembly line on a 'smoke-break' to find the Overseer.

Specific ideas of interest can be picked up from the Great Patriotic War, with the Blitzkrieg quickly leaving Europe's armies disorganized and unable to keep up. Innovations to how we use armor, how we use aircraft, and how we use infantry should all be implemented into our doctrine.

That is why Serov ordered his generals to read up on Tukhachevsky's military theory, and find a way to implement it into their own doctrine.\n\nTukhachevsky's writings on discipline within the army interested the General-Secretary greatly, as they easily fell in line with Ordosocialism's teachings. Tukhachevsky desired the entire chain of command to adhere to this spartan discipline, purging generals who failed to uphold their duty. Of course, Serov's generals were far more eager to discuss the actual tactics Tukhachevsky described. Offensive deep battle, defeating the enemy not only at the line of contact, but throughout the battlefield. Tukhachevsky also placed great emphasis upon operations as a third level of military thinking, and a crucial part of military theory.\n\nSerov's generals had a lot of work ahead of them. Integrating these new theories on armor, aviation, reconnaissance, airborne units, command and control, and even chemical warfare would take some time and a lot of organization.

They slammed shut their truck doors, the muck and sludge splashing onto their leather trench coats. They whipped out of their pistols, prepared to bring flashes of light to the dawn.

The head of Serov's agents, Yegor, took a seat with the German contact, cracking his knuckles and laying a pistol at the center of the table. He motioned to another agent, who brought forward a shot glass and a bottle of Koskenkorva Viina. Yegor looked insulted for a moment, before throwing the shot glass to the side and cracking open the Kossu. He chugged down the vodka, enough to refresh his throat, so, half the bottle.\n\n"These Finnish bastards get all the good alcohol. The war, the death, it could all be tolerated. But the lack of good drink? That is the greatest burden our people bear... Now, onto our" he chuckled to himself "negotiations." Yegor began to pat the rickety, wooden table upon which they sat. "We understand you can't yet begin any formal actions with our nation, so let Finland be our backdoor, for hands to be shaken and commerce to flow. We have depots in Lappeenranta, Uusimaa, and Vantaa. Now... what do you say, Hun?"\n\nThe German contact stared at his surroundings. The agents began to unfurl their knives and brass knuckles.

A neon haze emanates from the deadlights above. Yegor rests himself on his seat, clenching... something. The walls wash away, and the faces of the agents look to be photos of the purged and maimed. Yegor leans back, the drugs taking a toll on his cognition.\n\nA strange sight appears. A lanky, pale figure in business attire appears to sit in front of him. Yegor looks to his comrades, confused at what this vision could mean. Recalling his mission, he remembers that he was to meet a contact... of some sort. Unable to speak, Yegor stares forward at the blurry visage which may or may not be the contact. The figure unfurls a black, long, thing. Wielding the brain activity he still possesses, Yegor recognizes it as a weapon. This was... a weapons smuggler, yes. The agents move ever closer, forming a circle around Yegor and the figure. Yegor glances to and fro, beads of sweat rolling off his face.\n\nThis was... this was... a Breton! It was some sort of deal about the black market and the trafficking of agents worldwide. The details had long been lost to Yegor's mind. After eternity, or perhaps a few seconds, the figure stood tall, reaching out his... hand, maybe? Yegor pulsed his muscles.

The fourth corpse is those most tragic of deaths. Followers of socialist thought and nationalists, who have, nevertheless, rebelled against our righteous authority. They are contrarians, who seek to destroy instead of reform. The fifth corpse is for a hidden threat, those who claim to follow our ideals in full, but lie.

He had long since been resigned to that fact and his willingness to pay the price of their scorn was set long ago. He would have to deal decisively with the upper crust sooner or later anyway. Far too often, the poison of disunity could be traced back to some plutocrat seeking to profit from chaos.

Still, the higher-ups were adamant on the value of mounted soldiers and insisted the new company's "steppe instincts" would yield valuable insights once attuned to the realities of modern combat. Andreyev was not convinced.\n\n"Colonel Andrev?"\n\n"What is it this time, Captain?"\n\n"We should go home. It will rain soon and the ground here, it will be very bad for your cars. Soft. Too soft"\n\nSomething about the sincerity of the man compelled the Colonel to consider his advice. The exercise was, after all, on the Tatars home turf, not his. And he was glad he did. No sooner had he moved his men than the sky parted, as torrential rain poured down over the exercise field. As the rest of the company tried desperately to keep dry in their defensive positions, Akhmetov had his riders keep scouting their enemies, trusting his men to find good footing in between the muddy fields. In the days after, when the rains had ended, Andreyev had every advantage he needed to emerge from the exercise as the clear victor."

That couldn't be right! He just owned a little grocer, not a corporation.

And just to think, a few months earlier he was thinking of expanding HIS business. Now the government was driving it to the ground.\n\nNot like Lavr or any of the other "business experts" cared. They just reported good numbers and that was that. It is what you get when you make a bunch of bureaucrats running a business, after all. Clovis knew there was nothing he could do about it. It's not like he could leave, and even if he could, Clovis knew he could never live to see his business that he built from the ground up destroyed by Lavr and his lackeys.\n\nHe even missed back when the democratic socialists were in charge! At least they didn't butt their heads into his business as much. And they didn't fire Prav!\n\nHe looked down at the sales for the day again.

The method by which they had arrived there was, of course, very different, but the end result was the same. And, also like Eurasia, they had been challenged, within and without, and been found wanting in both cases.\n\nBut very much unlike Eurasia, they seemed able to, somehow, always resist internal disintegration. Seemed always able to, in the end, identify themselves and others as Americans, no matter their background. Seemed always able to recover, return stronger than before, and internalize a grim determination to continue their fight.\n\nHe contemplated this while looking at an enormous map of the confusing nation. It was truly maddening. Everything he wanted for Eurasia and its peoples, that strength of purpose, that unity in the face of repeated defeats, that defense against disintegration, the Americans already possessed. He had read numerous chronicles of American history in an effort to discover whatever special steps had been taken, and found nothing.\n\nGumilyov knew well that the Revolution could, would, falter if such a spirit could not be encouraged, but he could not answer the question of how to do so. And so he found himself staring for hours at the map asking, over and over, how they had done it.\n\nHe could find no answer."

He had known, immediately, that he would not be content with a life of farming, and though it had taken both years and many sacrifices, he had indeed reached his goal, joining that same air force.\n\nAnd he had learned, very quickly, that the purported equality of all the Soviet peoples had been a lie. Thrown into an under-equipped and under-prepared squadron, they had been savaged by the Germans during their invasion, and during the collapse that followed, the pilot had returned to his farm, resigning himself to a quiet life.\n\nBut the Passionarist Revolution had changed all of that. He was a Kazakh, yes, but more than that he was a Eurasian, and that distinction mattered. The equality that had once been denied was now freely given, and he again was given the opportunity to fly.\n\nEagerly accepting, he had found himself in short order taking to the skies above Kazakhstan, above Eurasia, and he knew that he would never allow that land to be threatened.

Taking a drag on his cigarette, he idly swirled the vodka in its glass, staring into the flames.\n\nThe flames of Eurasia's passionarity were blazing with a fury unsurpassed in the history of the superethnos, but there were more concerns than just conquest. Without proper guidance, the flames would burn out of control and become a wildfire, consuming the very nation he had worked so hard to establish. He had to retain power if he was to guide Eurasia along the correct path and restrain its self-destructive urges. But the Russians...\n\nGumilyov scowled. The Russians - or rather, the Russian nationalists - didn't understand that. It was a funny idea of Eurasia they had: Russia, but with a different name and different excuses for oppressing its brother ethnoses. He had already been forced to make too many concessions to them, and their influence was steadily growing. He hadn't done all this just to see the Eurasian project succumb to the same chauvinism that fostered hatred between the ethnoses.\n\nDowning the vodka and flicking his cigarette into the fire, Gumilyov stood and headed over to his bookshelf to find something to calm his nerves.

They had to move forward together, and seize their deserved destiny from those who wanted nothing more than to deny it to them.\n\nIt took the farmer many hours to process what the pamphlet had said. Prejudices long held, even absurd ones, ran deep, and took time to overcome. When he locked up his house and began travelling to town once again in order to find more literature he knew he was not yet finished in doing so, but he similarly knew he would continue to work at it.\n\nHe just needed more guidance, and more time besides."

The Reichskommissariat's administration had spies everywhere, both German as well as their many local collaborators, and the men knew that to be caught was, invariably, a death sentence.\n\nStill, however, they fought. For their homeland, their people, and their religion, they fought with every tool and tactic available to them, no matter the consequences. And if all went well, the boat approaching them was to bring both new tools as well as the promises of more to follow.\n\nAs the boat reached the shore, the men moved quickly to conceal it and move its crated cargo with all haste to the shore, while their leader met the contact who had ferried the cargo across the water. Together, they shook hands and inspected the contents of one of the crates. Automatic rifles, grenades, and blocks of high explosive - all effective for their purpose but also relatively easy to conceal.\n\nThe contact informed them that, if they could guarantee receipt, he could promise another shipment the next week. As well as every week thereafter. The Chechens quickly agreed. The effort required would be enormous, but the reward promised, an even more effective way to fight the hated Germans, was impossible to ignore.\n\nReturned to the departing boat, the contact smiled as it returned across the sea. The Chechens were Eurasians such as he, suffering under extreme oppression. But, in time and with the assistance he would provide, the Passionarist Revolution would come to the Caucasus.

Makeshift movie theatres, pamphlets, art shows, and more showed the history of Eurasia, one shared not just by the Rus, but by all peoples. What started out as an intellectual movement started by the émigré movement, championed by princes and essayists, evolved into geopolitical concepts which was later picked up by the Guide of the Passionariyy Revolution, Lev Gumilyov. Gumilyov's studies and policies as the then-leader of Ust-Sykolst would form the foundation for the Eurasian state. Liberation of different ethnic peoples, from the Tatar to the Komi, would follow from the unification of Western Russia from their various warlord states. All peoples of Russia were now free to shape their own destiny; forward together under the Eurasian banner.\n\nCultural exhibitions from different ethnic groups were also showcased, providing a convenient propaganda platform as well as a chance at multicultural reconciliation between various spectators.

What do you think?'\n\n'Well, Sergei, I admit that I may, on occasion, be overzealous in my pursuit of restoring Russia's glories. I like to think that my rhetoric is, in fact, simply the product of me caring too much about the wellbeing of the nation.'\n\n'Oh? But what about allegations that claim you employ criminal activities in destabilizing opposition?'\n\n'I assure every listener that this is not true. I am a man of the law, a compassionate conservative. My campaign tactics revolved around appealing to the human spirit, to the past and to the present. The future requires a lot from us, and I simply do not believe the liberal parties to be capable of being able to guarantee prosperity. Those who do not believe me, look at Germany - they are fascists, no?'\n\n'Well, yes, they are.'\n\n'But I do not advocate for racial purity, nor do I foam at the mouth over revanchism?'\n\n'No, you don't.'"

The weak light illuminated his work, the schematics for a road, again. Chalk-dust caked his hands, and he looked at his watch. Almost dawn. Yet, this work could not wait. There were no longer fetters to his progress. No more Suslov, no more Stalina, no more Taboritsky, and, sadly, no more Gumilyov. He missed them. Enemies they were, and adversaries, yet they almost seemed to be a call-back to easier times, when he was just a mathematician with tenure in Syktyvkar's university.\n\nIt was, again, a road. Street plans, points of illumination, specifications of material. As President of the Republic, his work had come to take entire days to finish. It was rare that he got the chance to work on an independent project of his. The roads were uncluttered, clear, ways of transport that ferried the pedestrians to their places, safe and quick.\n\nHe stepped back, and clapped his hands together, dispersing clouds of white over his uniform. Shafarevich could have sent for a servant downstairs to fetch him a basin of water, but he liked it that way. They can wash his shirt and trousers later. As the sun rose on the horizon, the work's significance became clearer and clearer. A reordering of the streets of Syktyvkar, a project that would entail the destruction and reconstruction of the city. He laughed. He was proud, even if his work was pointless.

A call-back to a greater past is necessary.\n\nOur commanders have concluded that the best place to search for these artifacts is in Konstanay. The followers of Islam have amassed a fine collection of religious artifacts there, ranging from sacred texts to pieces of Kazakh history. The generals have advised assembling a strike force and invading immediately, but we cannot afford to be so hasty. A full-blown invasion is currently above our logistical capacity, but the artifacts we seek are very old and fragile.

An entry interview revealed that they are entering on behalf of the [NIK.GetName], searching for artifacts of "ancient Eurasian civilizations." Further inquiries as to what they meant by this have been met with insistence on their academic integrity and qualifications, and of the great importance of their mission.\n\nHowever, they have paid for the proper permits and demonstrated some degree of credentials, and we have found no reason to bar their entry into the country.

The officials had (begrudgingly) given Dmitry and his crew permission to explore these wild peaks for the next month. An hour-long trip brought them to a large plateau in the hills, but there was still much ground to cover. Eurasia spared no expense in supplying them with the newest equipment available, and there was so much to see... for a second, Dmitry wanted to stay here. Russia was a smoldering mess, the air polluted by decades of warfare, but here... he looked up at the gray sky: the lazy clouds were close now, and he felt as if he was on the climb to heaven.\n\nBut a job was a job, and he had to make the University proud. The team would soon approach Chodak, the last major settlement this high up. And after that? Getting to the top cliffs was possible, but the professor felt a deep sense of dread as he stared at the jagged peaks, like daggers waiting to impale some unfortunate climber. They would need help.\n\nCommunications were still possible, so he could request helicopters from back home - they would get far, saving time. Alternatively, Chodak was rumored to be home to many guides, but their array of skills come at a price. Lastly, the team could attempt to brave the mountain by themselves, although Dmitry's training was limited to smaller heights in the Urals."

All around him, columns of rock and icy stretched to the skies, not unlike dancers, celebrating their arrival. Although breathing was difficult here, Dmitry allowed himself a laugh. He had come so far. From the Battle of Moscow to the great retreat, the second offensive, the betrayals... his mind slipped into a state of blissful ignorance where nothing but the present mattered. They were here, but there were many paths, and so, oh so little time.\n\nThe team could venture higher: the locals below informed them of a monastery perched atop a great mountain. The monks there would offer them refuge and could provide important information concerning old Eurasia. Alternatively, the team could travel forward into a mountain pass. They had some geological equipment, perhaps the crags tell stories of their own. Supposedly, there is another, smaller village to the East.

But at the end, a reprieve: when his division returned to Ust-Sysolsk they were permitted to shower, a rarity in the Russian wastes. The cold water washed away the dirt, but also memories of slaughter.\n\nSo it was here: The monastery stood against the snowstorm outside, massive yet tranquil, dimly lit by overhanging lamps. It was a welcome break from the struggle to get here, and the monks were welcoming. The team spent the next week resting and learning of their faith - they had only one translator, but that was sufficient to understand the history of Tibet.\n\nAs much as Dmitry appreciated comfort, he had a mission to accomplish. Long conversations with the monks revealed that there was a valley nearby, where 'ancient things lay'. Attempts to get the monks to elaborate on this statement only revealed the team's stress. The mountain mystics could cleanse their minds through intense meditation, and Dmitry silently admitted that he could use some help. However, the monastery held many ancient texts - it would take the team a week at least to decipher less than a fraction of them, but there was no doubt they held information on the past."

There were quite a few of them here - their white fur blended with the snow, so the team had to carefully navigate through.\n\nEventually, they made it to the end of the valley: a gigantic cliff, flanked by barren mountains, leading into seemingly bottomless pits below. The monks had hinted at there being pathways along the mountains' sides, leading into a complex cave system. The team got to work, fastening ropes and climbing over death itself until they found a single, snow-filled cave. Dmitry was the first to enter, and immediately spotted movement on the other end.

But his mind was ablaze with information, deadlines that had to be met, papers to be written.\n\n'Breathe in, out, in and out.' said the monk next to him. His voice was as smooth as the blanket of snow outside.\n\nDmitry tried to block the distractions around him, he made many attempts to venture into the dark pit that was his mind. Days came and went like this, every member of the team meditating and sleeping, while the archeological equipment rusted.\n\nOn the last day, Dmitry knew he had failed. They found nothing in Tibet, and he would receive all the blame. His mind raged against the world, against unfair government and cruel tyrants. The monk understood and placed his soft hand on Dmitry's shoulder. But the Russian looked back at him with angry eyes."

The head geologist had made a breakthrough: The majority of rocks found in this region were the same ones as those in the Urals! Old Union accounts substantiated this claim.

They ate the occasional mountain goat, some vegetation that barely scraped by, and drank from the nearby streams.\n\nThe team was welcomed, the only translator negotiated a rock cabin in exchange for some trinkets. By this point, Dmitry realized that this did not necessarily have to be a purely scientific expedition. These people must know much about the past, they seemed to be the type to conform to oral tradition. He could go about questioning the elders about the past.

Dmitry could only wait for the results. He forgot about the very concept of time here - the village oversaw the mountains below, a sight for sore eyes.\n\nEventually, the elders got talking about their folklore. This fascinated Dmitry, as he remembered the tales he heard as a child in the Union. Legends of witches, legendary warriors, monsters and demons sounded uncanny. So familiar, in fact, that the only explanation that Tibet and Russia could share mythology elements was that both had, at one point, belonged to Eurasia.

My own people don't take me seriously! They just keep giving me fetch quests.'\n\nThe elders blabbered old myths, but nobody had the time to listen. The village women wove great patterns out of goat hair, but so far no connection to Eurasia was established.\n\nAs the weeks came and went, Dmitry felt a deep sense of dread. It was too late, and they had failed. The helicopters would be waiting for them tomorrow morning, and they had nothing to show for all the investments.

The Eurasian government seems keen on seeing this expedition through, and has already filled out almost all of the necessary paperwork.\n\nIn fact, their eagerness might provide an opportunity. Keeping routes to contentious provinces like Sichuan is very expensive and militarily draining. Keeping their expedition safe on the journey there may require some extra capital on the part of the Eurasians. Additionally, there are many "special permissions" that will need to be granted, some by Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere officials. Greasing those wheels might necessitate some funds as well."

Our archaeologists are interested in excavating a large group of historic mounds to search for the remains of great warriors. Unfortunately, the Chinese are less than enthused about "ruining their cultural and historical heritage."\n\nIt seems our only way of gaining access is through negotiation, especially the monetary kind. We have three options for going forward with this. First, we send money to the archeologists to bribe the officials. It is no secret how corrupt the Chinese government is, and bribery will be the cheapest option. However, it is not certain if the officials will accept the bribe, no matter how much it is. There may be better, yet more expensive options. We could possibly offer the regional government money in exchange for inviting us to excavate the burial grounds. This would be much more expensive, as they would never accept a small bribe. However, it is once again uncertain if they will accept. While they probably need money, they may not be willing to take it in favor of letting us into the mounds.\n\nOur last option is negotiating a thorough agreement with the Chinese government. While probably having the most chance of success, it is by far the most expensive, and our biggest worry is that it could be a large waste of money if there turns out to be nothing of use in the mounds. Although, if there is, the value of whatever is hidden beneath the earth could easily repay it. Our archaeologists are starting to get impatient, so we should make a decision quickly."

The archeologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences are ecstatic at this opportunity, and urging us to take the deal.\n\nAdditionally, a project of this size could be a significant revenue generator.

Cyrille got up out of his chair and notified the Chinese, they found something.\n\nThe inside was dark, with only small bits of light coming through holes in the top. Turning on his flashlight, Cyrille and the other archeologists ventured into the large cave.\n\n"What is it?" Said another archeologist. "Ancient warriors? An Imperial Grave? Diamonds and gold?"\n\n"Unfortunately, quite the opposite it seems," Cyrille said, shocked at what he was seeing. Unending piles of skeletons filled the room, their eerie eyes fixated on the archeologists, with bones scattered all over. This wasn't the grave of mighty warriors. It was the mass grave of those slaughtered by those warriors.\n\n"It appears to me this is a mass grave from an ancient Mongolian invasion," said one of the Chinese officials, in broken Russian. "Since this is the property of the Chinese government, we will be taking all of the valuables within. I'm glad you decided to excavate this for us, it was definitely worth it."\n\nCyrille and the archeologists stood there, stunned. Had they dug the wrong grave?

I don't think there is anybody left in Russia, even within monarchist circles, who believes that a fully autocratic nobility means prosperity. And what of sustainability?' he turned to Gumilyov.\n\n'How will you run the state if your people are all slaves? How can you, in a conscious and sound mind, advocate for a pagan faith from the Gobi Desert? Why, Eurasia wouldn't even be able to reclaim the lost Motherland! It's army would be too busy riding horses around to realize what a rifle is!' The crowd broke into laughter. 'Eurasia's victory against the other warlords was simply a tactical blunder on their part. There were many times when our weak state could have been overrun, saved by pure chance. Why should we fix what isn't broken? Look at history! Capitalism, representation, even socialism worked to an extent! How is some archaic parody of a country supposed to bring about prosperity for its people?'"
 eurasianism.61.a:0 "And all the academics too."
 
 eurasianism.62.t:0 "Eurasian Rebuttal"
 eurasianism.62.d:0 "The debate resumed after a hostile break. Two fistfights broke out in the careferia, a full riot was stopped only by the bell. Gumilyov knew his position was weak. Even if he were to win the intellectual battle, few peasants were smart enough to look past the 'outlandishness' of his rightful ideology.\n\nSo, once everyone returned to position, he continued: 'Critics of Eurasia can only blabber on about 'sustainability' and buried ideologies. However, they are wrong. The peoples of Eurasia are the strongest in the Universe, for they have each other. The blood of the Mongols courses through our veins... we are heirs to a great legacy.'\n\n'These men who call themselves 'intellectuals' are blind to your struggles! They sit behind wealth, in rusted buildings, surrounded by outdated concepts. Hear me! Do you not wish for a greater meaning? Is there not a person here who will shy away from destiny itself? When life knocks, beckoning us to the past, through which we may have the future, will be shy away from the challenge, retreating to the comfort of history? A New Order calls us, to upturn the world and throw the yoke of the steppe upon those who did us wrong. The future awaits!"

 eurasianism.63.t:0 "Disorder In The Court!"
 eurasianism.63.d:0 "Gumilyov finished his statement, but before he could make it back to the chair, something hit him in the head. Quickly, he looked down to see a small stone. The hall descended into chaos, guards rushed against the mass of humanity. Angry yelling broke into cries of battle. 'For Eurasia!' yelled some brute as he picked up and threw an old man at the woman next to him. Puffs of smoke rose up as Gumilyov dodged more stones. The opposition, distressed, chose to retreat. His 'teammates' gave chase, before a bodyguard arrived to evacuate the leader.\n\nBy the end of the day, half of the university had burnt down and fifty people were injured. The next day, Gumilyov received a protest from Nekrich, accusing his men of 'facilitating a raid'. He demanded that Gumilyov return tomorrow to finish the debate."
 eurasianism.63.a:0 "'I didn't order those attackers!'"
 eurasianism.63.b:0 "Write a formal apology to all those involved."
 eurasianism.63.c:0 "Accuse the opposition of staging the raid."

 eurasianism.64.t:0 "Opposition Rebuttal"
 eurasianism.64.d:0 "The hall was a shell of its former self. A large hole now decorated the ceiling, the remains of two balconies littered the floor. A new, hastily erected podium stood before some eighty people. The opposition was half their original number, the judges seemed worn out, one had a nasty bruise around the left eye.\n\nNekrich menacingly eyed Gumilyov as he continued last day's speech: '... and for these reasons, my opposition's argument is null and void.' The debate was over, the judges retreated to decide the victor..."
 eurasianism.64.a:0 "And the winner is..."

 eurasianism.65.t:0 "Eurasian Victory!"
 eurasianism.65.d:0 "Gumilyov couldn't believe it. He had won. The opposition, stunned, stormed out of the hall upon hearing the judges' final decision. Apparently, a string of superior evidence and compelling arguments had completely swung the faith of the people. Eurasia shall no longer be an oppressive spectre that hangs over the steppes. Its people have seen reason, the idols of history have been smashed, and ahead: The future!"
 eurasianism.65.a:0 "Binding the continents."

 eurasianism.66.t:0 "Stalemate!"
 eurasianism.66.d:0 "Both sides stood in silence as the judges eyed each other. Although the fifth judge was technically the tie-breaker, either the reasoning of both sides or yesterday's events made him reconsider whatever decision he had previously made. Refusing to name a winner, the two sides stormed off.\n\nReturning home, Gumilyov breathed a sigh of relief. He had expected the academics to berate him, to demand more time-wasting arguments, but they remained silence. 'Many will take this silence as defeat on their part.' He considered. 'At least for now the concept is secure. It has withstood both war and scrutiny.'"
 eurasianism.66.a:0 "A hundred years to Eurasia!"

 eurasianism.67.t:0 "Eurasia Loses!"
 eurasianism.67.d:0 "The taste of defeat is always bitter. But at least Gumilyov retained his supporter base. The opposition walked away triumphant, but only by a slim margin. Gumilvoy retired to his home for the day, he had a lot of work to do. The minor academics must be purged, the untouchables discredited, the concept rebuilt piece by piece..."

 eurasianism.68.d:0 "A cheer came from the crowd as the judges made their final decision. Despite all the hard work, the debate had not gone in Gumilyov's favor at all. Nekrich walked away the victor, smiling at his colleagues and mocking the opponent. Former supporters defected to the other side, the concept was shattered. A dream unlived, thrown to the wolves, it will be years until the people are ready to even consider accepting Eurasian philosophy."
 eurasianism.68.a:0 "A dream falls."

 eurasianism.69.t:0 "Eurasia Routed!"
 eurasianism.69.d:0 "The crowd broke into a cheer, swarming around Nekrich and his vile supporters. Gumilyov was cast aside by his own people, a dream thrown to the curbside. His supporters quickly evicted the building, himself escorted by bodyguards.\n\nCome night, Ust-Sysolsk was in flames. Riots had broken out all across the nation, spurred on by the defeat of their 'oppressors'. The garrisons themselves began to doubt their cause, and high-ranking rightists remained silent on the matter. The government will have to be purged, and the dream may never be recovered."

 eurasianism.70.t:0 "Eurasia Teeters"
 eurasianism.70.d:0 "Gumilyov sat in his bunker, its ceiling shook as shells exploded above. His shaking fingers could barely keep hold of the spoon in his hand as he feasted upon canned beans. The guards had failed him, and Ust-Sysolsk fell to the anarchists. They burned Eurasian flags at first, in the streets, then it turned into violence. Homes were razed, businesses raided, policemen killed in cold blood. The local garrison declined to intervene, and had soon joined the rioters.\n\nSuddenly, the door to the bunker cracked open, but before Gumilyov had a chance to unholster his pistol, a friendly face appeared. The garrison of Vyatka had finally arrived to relieve the city's siege. They handed their leader a cover sheet and escorted him above ground. For the first time in a week, Gumilyov's eyes met the sun's rays. Ust-Sysolsk was in rubble. Smoke bellowed from ruins, they stretched to the horizon, trees had turned into trunks below a gray sky.\n\n'The rebels have been rounded up. It's over.' proudly announced the commander. But Gumilyov fell to his knees as he observed the carnage. 'So much work', he thought, 'all for nothing'. They will never accept Eurasia. 'Even if we win, it will be through fear. Oh, may the Heavens have mercy. The spirit is dead, the corpse of the New Order thrown into the pit.'"

 eurasianism.100.t:0 "The Eurasian Dream"
 eurasianism.100.d:0 "Gumilyov was confused by the report. The most recent poll in Ust-Sysolsk, the birthplace of modern Eurasia, showed that less than 40% of its inhabitants supported their current regime. The past eight months were filled with constant purges and police crackdowns, but every leader knows when too much is too much.\n\nObviously, Gumilyov could not sit around with his arms folded. 'Something must be done. If brute force can't suppress the people, we will have to play upon their minds... yes!' He assembled the high government, laying down proposal after proposal: 'Don't you see, gentlemen!' he announced, 'We must justify the concept to the people! How can we expect the peasants to work for a cause they know nothing about?'\n\n'But how shall this be done?' asked the economic minister.\n\n'Easy.' Gumilyov brought out a map of the Eurasian continent, 'We must send out expeditions across true Eurasia, to justify our righteous cause. It will not be easy, but failure here will mean the destruction of an ideology, an ideology that holds true salvation for us all. Let us not delay, gentlemen.'"
