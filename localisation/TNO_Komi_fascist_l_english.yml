 NIK_gcoup_gumilyovs_coup_desc:0 "With a little bit of luck, and a whole bunch of violence, Ivan Serov and his most loyal supporters now occupy the offices of government in the capital of the republic. The coup was executed flawlessly, with those who attempted to resist readily dealt with, and the most immediate dangers of a countercoup prevented. However, that being said, there is a significant amount of work ahead of us if we are to ensure that our government's power is cemented in Syktyvkar and beyond. We must take steps to pacify the capital, court both our political and civilian allies, among them Taboritsky and the urban workers, as well as smash the Komi left and prevent it from organizing a resistance to our new order. Right now, every minute - no, every second - matters to ensure that our administration is able to extend itself over the entirety of our territory."
 NIK_gcoup_shut_down_the_stagnant_desc:0 "If Serov and his followers are aware of anything, it's the danger posed by Mikhail Suslov and his loyal, fanatical bands of pro-Soviet leftists. For the past few months, if not years, Suslov has regularly ordered political assassinations and street violence from his bands and militias, and they have carried out, without question, every letter of his orders. As such, we can no longer trust the Komi left to sit by "idly" as we solidify our rule; they are surely plotting our demise. Suslov's deviousness, however, is not matched by his political posturing. The stagnant form of socialism preached by the left is far from a convincing path for the Russian people's future. As such, we must make sure that they never come to power. A combination of force and propaganda will ensure that we isolate them and their most fanatical ideologues from the rest of their supporters."
 NIK_gcoup_absorb_belozerov_desc:0 "The Komi left is nothing if not vicious. Caught up in the atmosphere of political chaos and instability, Suslov has become an incredibly ironclad figure, ordering political assassinations and contributing to the chaos in the streets. While Suslov and his attack dogs have had the right as their primary targets ever since the formation of the republic, that doesn't mean that we can't learn from them. In fact, we should ensure that we integrate a number of their tactics for political intimidation and violence, ensuring that our militias and those who command them are well-equipped to deal not just with the leftists, but with the democratic center as well. Right now, at the crucial moment, we should make sure that our competition, vehemently opposed to our Ordosocialism, is not in any position to protest the radical changes that we have planned."
 NIK_gcoup_align_taboritsky_desc:0 "Taboritsky has always been a wildcard in Syktyvkar's right-wing political scene. Regardless, it's no secret that he has a fairly sizable following which could be used to our advantage. However, it's likely that we would have to compromise with the man to ensure that we can win him over to our side.\n\nTaboritsky, despite his dubious character, would be an invaluable tool to preserve our new order in these chaotic times, especially with the amount of power he wields over the militias as a popular figure in their ranks. By aligning his goals with ours, we will be able to ensure not only that we gain a powerful ally, but deflect a potential enemy, at least for now."
 NIK_gcoup_appeal_to_the_clergy_desc:0 "Despite what Suslov and his leftist lackeys may claim, we are, after all, socialists. And who, if not the workers, do we serve? A number of individuals within our party have suggested that we play to our strengths to weaken our enemies and solidify our position. One of our strengths, as much as Serov hates to admit it, is not only his old connection to the left, but also his connection with the workers who the left had so desperately attempted to win over to their side. While we are attempting to consolidate our control of Komi's political apparatus, we should also appeal to the workers of the region, who will know that Ordosocialism is the future for the Russian people! After all, harkening back to as early as the October Revolution, it's clear that the workers, who are used to being organized and consistently desire a role in government, are a potent tool in the hands of those who know how to use them."
 NIK_gcoup_flood_the_streets_desc:0 "Even from our party headquarters, secured by the most loyal of militias, we can hear the chaos going on in the streets of the capital. The coup went off without issue, of course, however the fallout has been greater than we were expecting, and the mayhem that our actions have caused seems to have paralyzed Syktyvkar. Even if we are now nominally in control of the republic, that reality won't last long if we don't take action against the rioters, leftist militia, and political dissidents that are trashing the once-orderly streets of our capital. Thus, we must flood the streets with our supporters, push all the weapons that we have into their hands and court violence against our opponents, lest they take action against us first."
 NIK_gcoup_crowd_dispersal_desc:0 "While it's great to have our supporters in the streets bashing the skulls of our enemies, it's not enough to ensure continued stability going forwards. Drawing on both our militias and our civilian supporters, we need to work on dispersing both current and future potential crowds that may meet that would either threaten or attempt to overthrow our new order. To do so, we have a number of methods at our disposal - political intimidation, the economic strangling of both party institutions and individuals, violence, and the good, old-fashioned firehose. At this point, it's just a matter of selecting what sort of methods we want to use and allocating the resources required to ensure that we can permanently restore order to Syktyvkar first, and after that, the rest of the republic."
 NIK_gcoup_nobody_enters_desc:0 "To our north are the treacherous agents of Suslov's allies. To our south and west are the threats of reaction and the German. In this critical time - at this very moment - we need to ensure that with our mounting internal issues, no external force can take advantage of the instability. By intensifying border patrols, mustering together loyal garrison and militia forces who will be able to prevent the ingress of any potential threat, we will be able to complete Suslov's personal wish that, in his words, "nobody enters into our new state". By isolating Suslov's disconnected leftists and ensuring that anyone caught attempting to enter our territory is treated with extreme prejudice, we can guarantee that our new administration is, for the time being, protected from most external threats of subversion."
 NIK_gcoup_the_guns_of_the_passionariyy_desc:0 "People like Suslov and Zhdanov talk about a "people's revolution" like they know what that would be. It's no secret that their political goals and aims are as disconnected from the people as their lifestyles are. However, Serov and his most loyal supporters, the true Ordosocialists, are just as concerned with the people's needs as workers just as much as they are with their needs as Russians. We must now prepare to cultivate our support among those that would willingly give it - the military, the workers, and any civilians who decide to fight with us against the bourgeoisie who have been reborn through the process of the republic. Once we have done that, and secured ourselves a place at the head of the ex-republic, we can then proclaim our goal of the True People's Revolution, ushering in an era of democratic centralism, a fair economy for the worker, and pride in the Russian nation!"
 NIK_gcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_faithful_desc:0 "Triumph! Now that we've managed to stave off a counter-coup and put our ideological enemies on the sidelines, we can finally begin to focus on the good - Ivan Serov and his most loyal servants have found themselves at the helm of the Komi Republic, and for the first time in a long time, a semblance of stability is returning to the capital and beyond. The nation belongs to the Ordosocialists, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that Russia is reforged in a nationalistic, socialist state! Anything less than that and we risk falling into stagnation and decadence - an unfortunate reality that can be prevented, so long as the correct steps are taken, under the wise guidance of Ivan Serov.\n\nFirst, we will secure the west, and then we can extend our authority over all of Russia! Forward, for Russia and her people!"

 NIK_dcoup_Taboritskys_coup_desc:0 "정부 내의 많은 이들은 세르게이 타보리츠키가 위협이 될 거라 생각해본 적이 없었습니다. 그들이 날뛰는 미친 노인네라고 부른 세르게이는 오래 전에 죽은 한 소년에게 집착했습니다. 때문에 모두는 권력이 언제나 공화국, 혹은 정당, 혹은 군의 손 안에 있을 것이라 생각했습니다. \n\n그들이 아직까지 살아서 지금의 타보리츠키를 볼 수 있었더라면 무슨 말을 했을까요.\n\n그리하여, 세르게이 타보리츠키는 진정한 황제 알렉세이가 발견되기 전까지 이 땅의 섭정으로서 복무할 것입니다. 얼마나 오래 걸리게 되든, 로마노프 가문의 사람이 다시금 제위에 앉을 것입니다. 하지만 내일이 될지도 모를 그 날까지, 오늘은 저 반역자들을 처리할 것입니다."
 NIK_dcoup_crush_the_institutions_desc:0 "코미 공화국은 200석의 입법체를 동반한 민주대통령제 아래서 오랫동안 기능해왔습니다. 이 비효율적인 기관들이 러시아의 수많은, 정말 수많은 적들에게 악용당하며 코미를 나약하게 했습니다. As it stands, they only subvert the Regent's - and by extension, the Emperor's - will, which is unacceptable. If the Emperor's glorious vision for Russia is to be restored, then these structures must be purged and the traitors within eliminated."
 NIK_dcoup_no_more_unwritten_rules_desc:0 "이 땅엔 세 개의 불문율이 존재합니다. (1) No killing the leaders of the many factions, for the good of the Republic, (2) Prevent unnecessary death, aid the injured if you can spare it, and (3) Do not interfere with the lives of civilians. These rules restrict the Regent's plans, and allow for the Jewish and Bolshevik infiltrators to grow in power. The factions must be eliminated, for they do not recognize the Emperor, and in fact conspire against him. This is unacceptable, and must be dealt with immediately. Our stormtroopers should not have to spare a thought for the safety of the Emperor's enemies, and any restrictions upon their righteous actions must be eliminated... The civilians are the greatest place for Jewish and Bolshevik infiltrators to hide once we have destroyed their power bases. The civilians too must be integrated into the Regent's grand plan to rebuild Russia in preparation for the true Emperor's return."
 NIK_dcoup_no_more_disorder_desc:0 "Disorder is the greatest enemy of the people, fueled by cursed Bolsheviks and Jewish infiltrators, and there is no greater source of disorder in these lands than the legislature. It's squabbling Deputies, it's inefficiency, it's Bolshevik influence. This heretical, unholy structure shall be torn down, so that its rotten influence can be purged. Its Deputies shall be rounded up, and dealt with like Judeo-Bolshevik enemies should be. Under the Regency, all that shall remain is order efficiency, and devotion to the Emperor. The true Emperor of Russia demands it."
 NIK_dcoup_march_to_the_tick_of_the_clock_desc:0 "과거 통치자들은 하느님께 통치하도록 선택받는 신성한 권리를 지녔습니다. 이 신성한 군주들의 뜻이 곧 하늘의 뜻 그 자체였습니다. 더러울 볼셰비키들이 권력을 잡았을 때 놈들은 황제의 뜻을 거스름으로써 하느님의 뜻 또한 거슬렀습니다. 재상의 권한이 속되며 이러한 설명에 부합할 가치조차 없다곤 해도, 섭정이 이 지상에서 하늘의 가장 위대하고도 가장 중요한 종, 황제를 섬긴다는 것은 아주 분명합니다. 황제 알렉세이의 성스러운 뜻에 대한 무엄이란 있을 수 없으니, 이와 같은 죄악은 빠르고 잔혹하게 처리될 것입니다. 이것이 신성 러시아의 황제의 성권입니다."
 NIK_dcoup_unleash_the_stormtroopers_desc:0 "The Regent has many loyal followers, but none more loyal than his stormtroopers. This paramilitary organization's duty is to enforce the will of Emperor Alexei. These fanatical soldiers shall be called upon to destroy the regency's numerous enemies, who wage open rebellion in the streets. In order to ensure the Regent's plans are carried out, these soldiers must be righteous, courageous, and merciless in the face of the enemy. They must strike fear into the hearts of the regency's enemies, and destroy any trace of their foul influence left within these lands."
 NIK_dcoup_open_the_arsenals_desc:0 "Many paramilitary organizations patrol these lands, led by those who would deny the Emperor's authority. To more effectively deal with these traitors, we may make use of the extensive Syktyvkar Arsenal. It ranges from nonlethal tear gas to devastating supplies of chlorine gas. We have no need for such extravagant measures shall find their purpose later, for now tear gas and similar armaments shall prove sufficient for eliminating our current enemies. Dissent and rebellion shall not be tolerated under the Regent's watch."
 NIK_dcoup_no_limits_desc:0 "섭정의 적들이... 처음 생각한 것보다 더 강하고 수도 더 많은 듯합니다. While we have not yet been forced to use the more extreme measures of the Syktyvkar Arsenal, their time is now. Chlorine gas and similar weapons are needed in order for our stormtroopers to destroy the Regent's enemies. No more limitations to our troops' effectiveness will be tolerated, even if it means the death count will begin to dramatically rise. If it serves the will of the Emperor, then no other path is necessary."
 NIK_dcoup_the_only_movement_left_desc:0 "민주정. 그건 러시아의 신성한 통치자들을 전복시킨 더러운 반역자들의 목표였습니다. 이런 이단적 개념의 끝도 머지 않았습니다. 공화국은 붕괴하여 섭정의 정의로운 추종자들의 손에 파괴됐습니다. 이제 섭정이 이 사실을 공식적 현실로서 선언할 때가 되었습니다. \n\n오늘부로 공화국은 공식적으로 해체되며, 그에 따라 이 땅은 이제 섭정의 통치를 받게 될 것입니다. 러시아의 진정한 황제께서 발견되기 전까지, 이 섭정제는 세르게이 타보리츠키가 이끌어가게 될 것입니다. 러시아 황제 알렉세이시여 만수하소서!"
 NIK_dcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_sturmoviks_desc:0 "끝났습니다. 섭정에 맞서던 멍청이들은 분쇄됐으며, 하느님(과 식팁카르의 병기창)께서 도우사, 구 공화국의 누구도 우리에게 도전할 힘과 의지를 갖지 못 합니다. 그럼에도 진정한 행업은 아직 시작도 되지 않았습니다. 섭정께선 단순히 황제께서 우리 품에 환어하시어 도시국가 하나를 다스리게 되실 것에 만족하지 못 합니다.\n\n아니죠, 황제께선 통일 러시아에 임하셔야 하고, 섭정은 그분의 머리 위에 제관을 씌워드릴 준비를 해야 마땅합니다. Preparations will be made to bolster the Imperial Army, augmenting it with the ample supplies of chemical weapons we now possess. Furthermore, detailed plans for industrialization and modernization of Western Russia have already been drawn by the Regent's learned hand, ready to be put into action.\n\nThe Regent has thus declared the reclamation of Western Russia begun."

 NIK_ucoup_eurasianists_coup_desc:0 "The fire of our passionarity rises - the time for battle is at hand! We have struck a telling blow against the leftists and weakling democrats of the Republic, but the struggle is not yet won. The Guide of the Passionarist Revolution exhorts us onwards to greater glory, and it shall be ours. We must tighten the noose around the Republic before anyone else has the chance to topple us from power."
 NIK_ucoup_social_sphere_permeation_desc:0 "The Russian people at large do not understand Eurasianism. They deride us as esotericists, or worse: leftists, for our humane and progressive understanding of our brother ethnoses. Our message must be propagated throughout the Republic, so that the people come to understand what it is we fight for and why our cause is worthy of their support."
 NIK_ucoup_a_common_cause_desc:0 "The other rightists are altogether too reactionary - or, in Serov's case, socialistic - for our liking, but they are not without redeeming qualities. Specifically, their loathing for leftists makes them fanatically dedicated to the common cause of crushing the Republic left-wing bloc. We should appeal to our shared interests, so that we can rally more forces to the defense of our new government."
 NIK_ucoup_sideline_Taboritsky_desc:0 "세르게이 타보리츠키는 delusions of grandeur에 사로잡힌 광인이지만, 쓸모는 있습니다. 공화국의 유일한 주요 군주주의자 인사인 그의 기치 아래 비슷한 생각을 지닌 이들이 몰려있으니, along with many of the Orthodox Church's more fervent defenders. He thus has a large contingent of well-trained, fanatical soldiers at his command. We would do well to court him - if we can bring him under our influence, perhaps we can sideline him more easily later on."
 NIK_ucoup_the_eurasia_plan_desc:0 "We must remember what we are fighting for: not Russia, but Eurasia. Our ambition is not to merely rebuild another stagnant, chauvinistic empire. We seek the construction of a new society, a new kind of global power. Eurasia will be a land that finds strength in its ethno-cultural diversity, united by a shared historical heritage: the superethnos!"
 NIK_ucoup_secure_the_concept_desc:0 "Before we embark on the journey towards Eurasia, we must ensure that our support base is secure. If we start building atop weak foundations, the entire structure will eventually topple. Eurasianists must be placed in key offices, propaganda distributed and our civilian supporters protected."
 NIK_ucoup_highlight_external_threats_desc:0 "The enemies of the Passionaryy are not self-reliant like we are. The democrats enjoy support throughout the countryside, while the leftists are almost certainly receiving support from the WRRF. We can use this to our advantage; by highlighting the threats that come from outside Syktyvkar, we can paint our cause as more legitimately 'native' to the Republic."
 NIK_ucoup_an_army_of_radicals_desc:0 "We have one of the largest paramilitaries in the Republic; let us put it to good use! We have the central government buildings in our hands, but there are still many important public buildings, transport hubs, warehouses and infrastructure centers that lie in enemy hands. Let us send forth our brave Eurasianist soldiers to claim what is rightfully ours!"
 NIK_ucoup_none_may_contest_desc:0 "A show of force is what we need! There are many citizens who still doubt the capabilities of our paramilitary. Of course, we are not Bolsheviks who will simply mow down dissenters. Instead, we can convince them of our might by launching decisive strikes against the foe and engaging them in open battle to prove our superiority."
 NIK_ucoup_komi_belongs_to_the_true_passionarists_desc:0 "Rally, brothers! Rally to the flag of Eurasia! This is for something greater than a dead empire, or a fallen union! This is for the future, for the ultimate manifestation of the superethnos! Drive the enemy from our lands and raise high the black flag of Eurasia!"

The consolidation of Ust-Sysolsk under our new order, thus, will begin immediately, until we are capable of shattering any enemy that dares move against us, be they internal or external.\n\nOur foes are many, but our people are strong, and, if all else fails, the arsenals below Syktyvkar can always be pressed into service for the true Russian state."

The arsenal beneath Syktyvkar, and its chemical stockpiles, is the greatest example of this, but there exists many other such stockpiles. We must unearth these caches immediately, and arm our forces with their contents. A well-armed force is critical for the expansion of our state, and the impending reclamation of Russia."

One could also be entirely wrong. The state of the infrastructure throughout Ust-Sysolsk is utterly dismal, with numerous trade routes and valuable paved roads completely ignored by the old government, in favor of investing more money into government corruption, failed welfare programs, and grandiose, unworkable projects.\n\nWe must rectify this situation at once, repairing old infrastructure and constructing new roads to move goods faster, and allow our soldiers to redeploy more effectively."
 NIK_fashexpansion_assemble_our_forces_desc:0 "There exist elements within our state that are sympathetic to our goals and motivations, yet were forbidden from gaining crucial military experience by the previous government. We will rectify this, as well, and expand our recruitment to those that formerly would have been discharged for 'radicalism' and 'disloyalty' by the old Republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc:0 "Despite everything we have done, our armament programs and recruitment programs, an army is nothing but a mob of ill-organized rabble without competent officers and quality training. We must assemble our army's high command and consult the officers of the Republican Army who have remained loyal to us, for a comprehensive new program of training and disciplining our forces."
 NIK_fashexpansion_oaths_of_loyalty_desc:0 "There is an important question vexing the political apparatus of the state, and the military apparatus alike. This question regards the oaths of loyalty that each soldier is to take. The old Republic had a set of oaths dedicated to protecting and upholding democracy, the Republic, and the Komi Constitution, which will clearly not do. However, the factions that make up our current government are conflicted as to which form the new oaths shall take.\n\nThe more monarchist-inclined groups wish to restore the Tsarist oaths, swearing loyalty to a crown and throne that are currently vacant. The more mainstream elements of the government, on the other hand, wish to reword the old Republican oaths to fit our newer, stronger state. There are even some elements within the state that view the Soviet oaths, and their commitment to ideology, as a possible model. The Army must come to a decision, to ensure the loyalty of our troops, and a united military."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_anti_bolshevik_pact_desc:0 "The state of Vyatka, under the Tsar Vladimir III, is not an ideal ally. Indeed, in a less desperate situation, it would be considered an enemy to strike down as soon as possible. However, we do not have the luxury of such an idyllic situation. With the growing red storm to our north, we must approach the pretender Tsar, for the good of both of us. Only once the Reds are defeated, may we have the luxury of reconsidering our foreign policy situation.\n\nWe must approach Vyatka with a proposed Anti-Bolshevik Pact, for mutual defense and shared training, until the sacred task of casting down the communists is completed."
 NIK_fashexpansion_better_than_the_reds_desc:0 "Vladimir has pulled through for us, and revealed himself as at least a semi-decent ally of our cause. He has agreed to commit to our Anti-Bolshevik Pact, and begin cooperating with our state for the purpose of putting down the Front... at least for the time being."
 NIK_fashexpansion_officer_exchanges_desc:0 "Our officers have faced different conditions to those of the Tsarists, and have served on the frontline in border raids against the Reds, in many cases. Our practical experience is a boon to us, but the Whites to our south have the theoretical advantage, having fought in the West Russian War against the Front on the grand scale. We have fought the communists in the present, and they have fought them in the past - there is much to learn on both of our ends. Let us share this knowledge with our partners against the red menace."
 NIK_fashexpansion_joint_army_maneuvers_desc:0 "Our doctrine has its strengths, but also its flaws. The more experienced units of Vyatka, thankfully, are willing to help rectify the issues present in our training, supply chain, and combat techniques. While their aid is to be viewed with suspicion, of course, what useful knowledge they provide is precious, and is to be taken seriously. If Vyatka can help us fill the holes in our army's pool of skill, its aid is to be greatly appreciated."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_civil_war_relived_desc:0 "The days of the Civil War were dark for our nation, setting the stage for the eventual national disintegration of our great country into what it is today. However, we now have a chance to reverse it. With the aid of Vyatka, we shall be able to strike back and vanquish the Reds which destroyed Russia, and erase all traces of communism in our nation. The time is now - the only question is who will set the Reds' demise into motion. Their foolish action... or our triumphant initiative."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_pretenders_betrayal_desc:0 "Typical. The false Tsar of Vyatka has rejected our pact, and decried us as fascists and traitors to Russia. Clearly, he has forgotten who is the fell and base Nazi collaborator, and who is the true Russian patriot. This betrayal, while it may seem mortal, shall not cripple us. We must rely only on our own strength and will, and through this, we will triumph over all who dare oppose us."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_propaganda_offensive_desc:0 "Clearly, the supposed Tsar has proven himself an enemy of our state, and by extension, an enemy of all the peoples of Russia. Through a repurposing of our broadcast infrastructure, and the abundance of print shops in our cities, we will begin a propaganda offensive against him, and his cruel, backwards regime. The Russian people must be lead to realize that the state in Vyatka is not the future of Russia - it is a relic of a dark, ineffectual past, little better than the Reds themselves!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_recognize_eurasian_strength_desc:0 "Our state is situated in a strategically useful area, with abundant resources, population, and industry. The communists, as evil as they are, after all, would not have made Ust-Sysolsk their temporary capital without reason. We must remind our people of this - that we are strong, that our soldiers are the greatest in Russia, with the will to protect their families and the nation that they love. We do not need allies, for allies are mere temporary, transient things, in the shifting mass of allegiances that is the new Russia. No - it is best to stand on our own, and strive out against the dark!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_ring_of_steel_desc:0 "There is no single defense plan that is sufficient to defend Ust-Sysolsk from all of the threats that surround us. With the hostile Tsar in the south, the erratic fanatics of Gayny to the East, the liberals to the West, and the Front practically on the doorstep of our capital, we must seek a single all-encompassing solution to our defensive woes.\n\nAnd that solution shall come in the form of a ring of steel. A vast network of fortifications must be constructed around our frontier, to defend our state from attack. While we do not have the resources to form a strong, consecutive string of fortifications, we shall be able to construct enough small border forts to ensure that attacks are greatly dissuaded. Ust-Sysolsk shall be secure from attack, from any angle, leaving us free to plot our grand reclamation of Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_eurasia_awaits_desc:0 "We have prepared enough, going through all of the preliminary strokes of diplomacy and armament. Now, is the time for expansion, and the reunification of the Motherland. Russia awaits, with her west open for our taking - there lies only our enemies standing in our way. They are many, and we are few, but with the will of the Russian people on our side, alongside our connections and our formidable arsenal, our state shall emerge triumphant, and reclaim her fair lands.\n\nWith our preparations complete, the only thing left to do is issue our orders to our diplomats and generals, and prepare for the greatest string of conflict that we shall face yet."
 NIK_fashexpansion_demand_gaynys_submission_desc:0 "The Order Of Saint George has a cause that one may consider righteous - to honor God, and to oppose the anarchy that has consumed the Motherland. However, they are insular, radical, and unwilling to cooperate with outsiders, viewing them as insufficiently pious at best, and outright heretical at worst. For better or for worse, we must end this policy, by force, and issue an ultimatum to the monks of the Squirrel's Nest Fortress - submit to our state, and be free to practice their religion within our borders, following our laws, or face our armies on the battlefield."
 NIK_fashexpansion_embrace_the_church_desc:0 "With the Gayny settlement under our control, and the Order now within our jurisdiction, now is a prime opportunity to set a precedent for our future religious policy. As always, the factions within our government are split on this issue, with a wide range of theories stretching from cracking down on religion to embracing the Orthodox Church as a central pillar of Russian culture. Throughout our state, other religious groups are looking to our policy on this issue as a guideline towards what they, too, should expect in the future from our government's policies."
 NIK_fashexpansion_rebuild_the_monestaries_desc:0 "Although the monasteries and fortresses controlled by the Order were grand, not even they were immune to the ravages of war and the bombings. Throughout the long decades of shame experienced by Russia, the churches and monasteries of Gayny have stood strong, but have not escaped entirely unscathed.\n\nAs a show of goodwill towards the Order of Saint George, and towards the Orthodox Church in general, the more traditionalist elements of our government have advocated for a comprehensive program to rebuild the religious architecture of Gayny. The reception of this plan has been mixed, with more modernist elements railing against it as a waste of valuable resources."
 NIK_fashexpansion_anti_bolshevik_maneuvers_desc:0 "The West Russian Revolutionary Front, to our north, represents the greatest threat to our state, and the successful creation of a Russia free of communist influence. However, the likelihood that we will be able to cast it down right away is insufficient to make our generals entirely certain. To this end, we must determine a policy towards our consolidation of the region - securing a barrier against the Front's expansion, before striking it down, or launching a pre-emptive attack while the Front is distracted with other matters."
 NIK_fashexpansion_consolidate_the_bloc_desc:0 "We must choose to delay our strike on the Front, and instead target the 'neutral' state of Vologda that lies to our west. By striking at Vologda, we will be able to lock down everything south of the Front's current territories, starving the communists and preventing them from bringing any more of Russia under their hateful influence. Additionally, we will be capable of using the resources of the city for our own purposes, for the future reclamation of the West."
 NIK_fashexpansion_ultimatum_to_the_neutrals_desc:0 "The state of Vologda presents an interesting dilemma for our generals. It has a decent army, although not as strong as the Front itself, yet it is, at least formally, apolitical. Our strategists have deemed it as possibly having sympathies with our cause of a communist-free Russia, but possibly opposed to our 'extremist' ideology. Thus, it is at least worth an attempt at diplomacy. Putting our best foot forward, we will send an ultimatum to Vologda, offering them compensation for unification with our state, and significant investments in their region. If they do not accept our generous offer, of course, there will be trouble..."
 NIK_fashexpansion_cast_down_democracy_desc:0 "Vologda has been secured, whether it be by penstroke or gunshot. Now, there lies the task of casting down the 'democratic' institutions of the former city-state, much as we dissolved the same weakened, backwards institutions in our own state. Our promises to the people of Vologda will stand... to an extent, but we must alter the deal regarding their level of autonomy within our state. We will have no tolerance for potential havens of liberalism, within our very borders."
 NIK_fashexpansion_pre_empetive_strike_desc:0 "As tempting of a target that it is, the WRRF must be our primary objective for attack. Allowing it to consolidate itself any further is unacceptable from a strategic standpoint - with the level of disarray it finds itself in at the moment, we could find ourselves able to defeat it as easily as the Germans shattered Bukharin's Union in the second world war. The men must be prepared - we have no time to waste."
 NIK_fashexpansion_strike_the_front_desc:0 "Everything is ready. Our guns are loaded, our tanks are fuelled, and our men are aware of our plans to tear down the communist abomination. All that awaits is to send the signal that shall propel us to the final war against the Reds, and the beginning of the reclamation of Russia!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_purge_the_last_remnants_desc:0 "The Front has been cast down, but our work against Bolshevism does not end here. Throughout Arkhangelsk, there lies legions of officers and commissars, some of whom who have fought to spread the Red plague through Russia since before Bukharin's defeat. There is only one option - we must neutralize their influence, forever and always, to ensure that Bolshevism never returns to our lands. There is to be only two possible fates for Reds - a cold cell, or hot lead."
 NIK_fashexpansion_mop_up_the_spare_desc:0 "In our dash to consolidate power in our region, we have been forced to prioritize one threat over the other. The threat we have mercifully ignored has continued to exist... until now. We must utilize the resources of our newly conquered territory to cast it down, and finalize the consolidation of our control over the region."
 NIK_fashexpansion_dissolve_the_pact_desc:0 "With the Reds gone and buried, our pact with the Tsar to the south has outlived its usefulness. Vyatka no longer represents a possible ally, but rather a rival for regional supremacy. The pact must be formally dissolved at once, and our forces prepared to strike south at a moment's notice.\n\nVladimir, of course, does not need to know about this until the time comes."
 NIK_fashexpansion_topple_the_tsar_desc:0 "The time has come to strike south, finally, and secure the fertile lands of Vyatka. The Tsar, the pretender Vladimir III, may pretend that his army is a pre-eminent power, but we know the truth, from careful observation. The White Army is tired, with outdated tactics and aging generals - the time for the old empire has long since passed on.\n\nThere can be no peace or compromise with this symbol of the distant, shameful past - there is only to be a swift strike over the Vyatka River, bringing an end to the last relic of the Russian Civil War."
 NIK_fashexpansion_indulge_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Despite the shameful state of Vyatka, and the treacherous nature of the false Tsar Vladimir, the ideology of monarchism is hardly discredited as a viable means of governing Russia. Sergey Taboritsky and his monarchist faction, while quite divergent from the rest of our front, are influential nonetheless, and advocate strongly for preserving and protecting the history of the Tsardom.\n\nTo indulge Taboritsky and his followers, we could place several of his supporters in high administrative positions in the newly conquered territories of Vyatka, with Taboritsky himself as the local governor. While this will most certainly allow him to gain power, influence, and support amongst the people, could it be worth it to ensure that the holy traditions of Russia are preserved, protected, and rightfully revered?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_crownlands_are_eurasian_desc:0 "With Vyatka captured, and its vast population now under our guiding hand, the time has come to incorporate and integrate the territory. Officials must be tested for loyalty, taxes must be collected, bandits and holdouts must be eliminated, and censuses must be conducted. Only once this long process of integration is complete, can we hope to see the full potential of our latest conquest finally realized."
 NIK_fashexpansion_relocate_the_capital_desc:0 "Our current capital, Ust-Sysolsk, has great benefits. It is far from the frontlines, in a strategic location, and has years and years of administrative framework dating from the days of the WRRF and all the way to the dawn of the new state. However, another option exists, one that has been realized by the newly integrated region of Vyatka.\n\nThe city of Vyatka itself would make an excellent new capital for our state, hosting all of the ministries and infrastructure that were used by the Tsar to manage his realm. It lies in a central location, with a large and fairly loyal population, and is on a much more conveniently located river, for ease of transportation. To move the government is a daunting task, and some may say impractical at this point in time, but with our state's newfound strength, it can surely be realized easily."
 NIK_fashexpansion_secure_the_border_desc:0 "Along the long and porous border of the German occupation zone, numerous states have sprung up, forming a clear western flank to secure against potential German invasion. We should prioritize securing this border strip and eliminating the various warlords that pose easy routes for a German incursion into Russia's heartland. Only we can be trusted to effectively defend against the German scourge, and our rhetoric towards the warlords of the West must reflect this."
 NIK_fashexpansion_punish_the_pirates_desc:0 "The city of Nizhny Novgorod, on the intersection of the mighty Volga and the Oka rivers, is an absolutely crucial strategic asset and population center, forming a veritable lynchpin for any who wish to have a serious chance of unifying Russia. Its tank factories will be critical for striking down stronger foes in the future, and its population will be an invaluable asset.\n\nThis, however, can only be achieved by capturing the city in the first place. Currently, the city and its vast industry are controlled by a glorified gang of bandits and communists, who have dedicated themselves to raiding their neighbors, and growing fat on their spoils. This, however, can be used to our advantage. A message shall be sent to Averin, the leader of the Gorky bandits. Stand down and hand over the city, and he will be rewarded with further riches. Refuse to surrender, and he will be shot like a dog."
 NIK_fashexpansion_absorb_the_tank_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet of assembled tanks and support elements is considered by many of our generals to be the true prize of Nizhny Novgorod - a vast reserve of armored power that can be deployed against our future foes. The bandits controlling the city before us at least had the foresight to hire competent personnel to arm them, and keep the factories running. We will profit from this by extension, and mobilize the motorpool of Nizhny Novgorod for the purpose of our state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_control_their_factories_desc:0 "Whereas the current personnel running the factories of Nizhny Novgorod are at least semi-competent, they are hardly loyal to us and only us. A less charitable state could denounce them as a pack of mercenaries loyal only to profit. In light of this, some changes in their management must be pursued. Rather than following the logic of the bandits' market, the heavy industry of Nizhny Novgorod must be put under direct control, for the purpose of aiding our sacred task to reunify the Motherland."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_tatar_ultimatum_desc:0 "While the Tatars have seceded from the Motherland, they have reason to do so. After all, the Soviet Union was atrocious towards the Turkic population, attempting to stamp out their passionarity and ensure their servitude. Gumilyov has proposed a plan to appeal to the Tatars, with a formal diplomatic request. If they join our state, they shall join us as equals, and have their culture honored as one that is developed and mighty in its own right. If they refuse, however, we will have no choice but to send in the tanks. We are merciful, of course, but we cannot tolerate opposition."
 NIK_fashexpansion_break_the_tatars_desc:0 ""Tatarstan" is nothing but another rightful province within Russia, and the Tatars are merely Russians that have refused to assimilate. Through a swift and decisive invasion of the renegade Tatar state, we will be able to put an end to this separatist nonsense, and secure the city of Kazan as a crucial component of our new Russian state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_measure_of_respect_desc:0 "As fellow peoples of the steppe, and fellow conquerors, we hold a special kinship with the Tatars. Together, we have existed for centuries, travelling across the vast plains of Eurasia. While they are not Russian, they are our fellows and companions, and must be respected as such. The Tatars will be given their own autonomy within our state, where their culture may be conserved. Our passionarity is akin, and so our races are kin."
 NIK_fashexpansion_russians_in_all_but_name_desc:0 "The Tatars are conquered once more, and once more their separatist urges are defeated. What the region of 'Tatarstan' truly needs is not autonomy or recognition, but rather a total integration. Kazan, and the lands around it, will be incorporated into our new state wholesale. There is to be no native autonomy, for why should there be? The Tatars are merly Russians that have lost their way, and their culture is merely a relic of their collective delusion."
 NIK_fashexpansion_ghosts_of_the_war_desc:0 "The Russian Liberation Army, a German construction of the West Russian War, has found their home in the city of Samara, and permeated the region like a cancer. While they may claim to possess ideals compatible with ours, or indeed compatible with the Russian people at all, they are nothing but traitors and German lapdogs.\n\nVlasov has committed the greatest possible violation of the Motherland's honor, by serving those who wish to see the Russian people themselves cast down and reduced to a state below that of animals. For this, the ROA deserves nothing but swift and total destruction. Our armies are ready. Let their wrath descend upon Samara, and shatter the traitors once and for all."
 NIK_fashexpansion_scour_samara_desc:0 "Samara is ours, and with it, we have secured miles upon miles of fruitful land, dozens of factories, and arsenals overflowing with useful equipment. However, we have also inherited another, less valuable thing. Traitors.\n\nSympathizers with the Russian Liberation Army, and the Germans, fill our newly occupied territory, and their partisans continue to fight our forces in many areas. The solution to this problem is simple. A grand crackdown on this treason, and no mercy for any poor fool who dares carry on the cause of a dead traitor."
 NIK_fashexpansion_push_to_the_urals_desc:0 "The Urals are the natural far eastern border of this first phase of our expansion, with the exception of the unassailable Vorkuta. A selection of petty warlords dares to exist along the lines of the mountains, relying on the natural barriers and isolation to protect them from true contenders such as our state.\n\nNo longer. We will sweep south, along the grand mountain range, and secure our eastern border from those that wish to attack from the lands of the fell West Siberian People's Republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_slaughter_the_syncretists_desc:0 "The Mladorossi may be incomprehensible to the uneducated, but we are no simplistic peasants. We are aware of their true leanings - their complex ideology that values national strength, tradition, and rapid development. They are not communists, who we must oppose, nor backwards, mindless monarchists, but rather represent an ideology that could do great things in practice. Kazembek is a reasonable man - we shall send him a diplomatic request, and offer a position within our government in exchange for his full cooperation in the integration of Berezniki into our reformed state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_welcome_the_true_fascists_desc:0 "Our appraisal of the Mladorossi was correct, it seems, and the integration of Berezniki into our state is projected to go by without a hitch. The ideology of the Mladorossi continues to be a fascinating element, one that is quite appealing to many within our state, especially the followers of Taboritsky. The development of Berezniki can be greatly hastened by leaving its administration more or less untouched, and allowing the current government to exist with only minimal oversight."
 NIK_fashexpansion_purge_the_crypto_socialists_desc:0 "It seems that our generous appraisal of the Mladorossi was granted too soon. The Mladorossi have resisted every attempt to negotiate, and bring them into the fold, after our occupation of Berezniki and comparatively light-handed treatment of their organization. No longer. Kazembek and his highest officials shall be arrested and imprisoned, with trials broadcast over radio. This will serve as a warning to the rest of the Mladorossi - cease their organization against our regime, or face the same fate."
 NIK_fashexpansion_death_to_the_racial_traitors_desc:0 "Centered around the city of Perm lies quite possibly the most abominable foe we have ever faced. Unlike the ROA, who have only betrayed the Russian nation, the so-called "Aryans" of Perm have slandered, spat on, and dishonored everything that it means to be Russian. They denounce their true race as degenerate and subhuman, instead aspiring to the alleged heights of the hated conqueror that has struck our nation down to such a low status. There can be no mercy in return for this insult - we must mobilize our armies, and strike down this abomination, to save the very souls of the people trapped under the false "Aryan" yoke."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_second_purification_desc:0 "The Aryan Brotherhood claimed that they had 'purified' their lands, removing the stain of the 'untermensch' and instating a new order under their enlightened rule. This is, of course, mere delusion. The city of Perm and the lands around it have been stripped bare of their character, and the peoples of the region have been abused and enslaved by the "Aryans". We must aid the region, liberating the people from their chains, prosecuting the leaders of the damned cult, and installing a completely new local administration. The crimes which one must commit to be considered Aryan are a clear tell-tale that none of the Brotherhood's members are to be trusted. Thankfully, now, they will forever bear the marks of shame."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_bashkir_ultimatum_desc:0 "Similarly to the Tatars, the Bashkirs are another Turkic ethnicity that has historically lived alongside the Russian people since time immemorial. They possess a strong sort of passionarity, akin to those of Russians. Despite our differences, we were meant to be bound together, and so, we will dispatch a diplomatic mission to Ufa. If the Bashkirs are wise, they will accept our offer of union without resistance, and join us in the halls of history. If they foolishly refuse, there will be no other option but war."
 NIK_fashexpansion_our_turkic_brethren_desc:0 "The lands of Bashkiria are once more returned to us, firmly under our rightful control. In the process of integrating the region, assigning administrators, and beginning censuses, we must remember the most important component of dealing with our companion races - respect for their traditions, and co-existence as fellow peoples of Eurasia, and the steppes. Our passionarity is alike, and with them, we are stronger than we would be alone."
 NIK_fashexpansion_end_the_bashkir_heresy_desc:0 "The so-called independent republic of Bashkiria is nothing but a separatist fantasy, an illegitimate state carved out of the territory of what is rightfully Russian. Its Islamist nature is contrary to the very nature of the Russian civilization, and the separatist nationalism held by its peoples is an affront to our sensibilities. Bashkiria will be rightfully taken into Russia once more, through bullet and bomb, fire and sword."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_unitary_russia_desc:0 "The state of Bashkiria is once more within our grasp, and its armies have been routed before our superior firepower. All that is left to do now is to integrate the former Bashkiria as a new province within the new Russian state. The new administrative unit shall be named Ufa Oblast. A replacement of the administration shall follow, with Russian-language curriculum instated, and a census run to determine the exact population and demographic composition of the region. The mistakes of the past in dealing with the Bashkirs will not be repeated."
 NIK_fashexpansion_restoration_day_desc:0 "Today, the most momentous occasion in the history of our new state has arrived - the day of the reunification of the territories West of the Urals. Through our labor, blood, and diplomatic efforts, all of west Russia has finally come under the control of our new state. Our vast lands extend from Arkhangelsk to Samara, with a loyal and proud population millions strong. For this achievement, the end of warlordism and Bolshevism in our lands, a national holiday shall be declared, and parades held in all of our major cities.\n\nTruly, today is the first step in the rise of a new, proud Russia - it is the day of the beginning of the end of the enemies of the Motherland!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_lessons_from_unification_wars_desc:0 "The enemies we faced in the re-unification wars to restore West Russia were varied in their tactics, ideologies, and equipment. From the deep battle of the communists, to the manuever warfare of the ROA, we have faced every doctrine that could be thrown against us, and we have emerged victorious. However, this does not mean we should grow complicit. There is always more to learn, from our defeated foes, and integrating techniques and tactics from past enemies could help us refine our formal strategies even further. The general who does not adapt to changing paradigms, after all, is doomed to fall to a general that does."
 NIK_fashexpansion_finalize_industrial_policy_desc:0 "The industrial base of Russia has developed since the West Russian War, despite Bukharin's disastrous policies. However, it has not developed in a sane or consistent manner. Various warlord states' grandiose industrial visions have been carried out in clashing, contradictory ways, with redundant supply chains and technologies intended to make use of domestic resources. One of the most critical economic issues we face is binding all of our regional economies together, making use of the enhanced economics of scale, and working to ensure that functional and efficient logistics networks are operational."
 NIK_fashexpansion_roads_that_bind_us_desc:0 "Expanding on our logistical ambitions, another issue that we must face is our lack of coherent centralized rail or road systems. While warlord states did indeed build roads, they were often insular and limited, not connected to roads in other fiefdoms. An understandable priority, but one that we most rectify. New bridges must be build over rivers that once formed borders between warring states, collapsed tunnels must be re-excavated, and miles upon miles of road and rail must be laid, to build the new ties that bind us together as a true nation, rather than a mere collection of smaller states."
 NIK_fashexpansion_revitalized_russian_people_desc:0 "Most importantly of all of our reforms to the new Russian state, the people's morale and political will must be revived. For too long, warlord conflict, bombings, and stavation has eroded the shared identity of the Russian people, and eaten at the Russian patriotism within the hearts of the populace.\n\nA patriotic curriculum in schools must be established, focusing on our shared Russian identity. At long last, our people shall once more be revitalized, and their hearts shall beat with pride for our new state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_one_last_chance_desc:0 "Only one more task remains to ensure our complete control over West Russia, and our mandate to unite the rest of Eurasia. The reclamation of the territory of Onega, and a victory over the state of Finland on the field of battle. Finland presents a unique opportunity, as our gateway to Europe - securing a favorable peace deal with the Finnish state will both allow for possible territorial reclamation, but also serves as a show of strength to Germany and all other Pakt-aligned nations. By defeating Finland, we can secure honor and recognition in the eyes of the international community, and be respected for our triumphant martial prowess."

 NIK_fashexpansion_the_internal_conflict_desc:0 "When a united right wing coalition was announced, few could believe an alliance of different parties was possible; even fewer believed this coalition could get into power. However, those skeptics are now proving themselves right as the faction leaders feud and bicker amongst themselves. The question of when it will collapse is not a matter of if, but when. The civil servants who run the country must prepare for the coalition's dissolution and a return to factionalism and infighting, ensuring that the new power struggle will not be as destructive as the old."
 NIK_fashexpansion_crack_the_coalition_desc:0 "The Coalition as it stands is a complete farce. Every day, its representatives in the National Assembly fight each other with words and with fists over the most trivial matters of policy. Notifications to the leaders of rival parties and issuing declarations of revoking our participation in the Coalition will be easy to send, and the likelihood of other parties accepting is very high. The official dissolution of the Coalition may mean a return to the days of constant deadlock, political infighting and inter-party street battles, but at the very least it will reflect the current reality on the assembly floor."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_new_oaths_desc:0 "The Coalition lies in shambles, its members are feuding with each other both in the debating hall and the street, and the National Assembly is aimless in its direction. If its representatives were to swear allegiance to one party, it would do much to restore public faith in the government, particularly as few citizens believe they have loyalty to anyone other than themselves. However, the question of who to swear loyalty to remains. It is still divided among party lines, and pledging allegiance to one would only unite the Assembly against them. Many deals and compromises will have to be made between leadership and representatives, but a united Assembly may just be possible."
 NIK_fashexpansion_make_a_break_for_it_desc:0 "The men who were once the torchbearers for a new vision of Russia have devolved into bickerers and factionists. The old guard of the Passionariyy can no longer be trusted to rebuild the Motherland - however, that does not mean Russia does not have a future any more. Taboritsky, Serov, and others did not join the Passionariyy out of idealism, but of convenience, but they are the ones who the torch shall be passed onto, who shall return Russia to glory. Perhaps a proposal to cut them a deal to increase their power in Komi is in the works."
 NIK_fashexpansion_forward_to_the_future_desc:0 "Serov is an outlier, a self-proclaimed socialist who believes that the Russian worker should be the centre of the new Russian order the Passionariyy seek to create. Thus far, he has been almost completely rejected by more orthodox Passionariyy members, which makes his vision so invigorating. By agitating the common people and showing them how the rise of Russia is in the best of interests for workers across the nation, he may be the one who can reinvigorate Russia with their strength and lead her back to glory."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_red_brown_alliance_desc:0 "Communism and its platitudes of equality for all people has been properly consigned into the pages of history; however, a sizable contingent of people refuse to acknowledge this. However, rather than showing them how obsolete their beliefs are in person, with the rise of Serov, it may be more useful to find them places in the Passionariyy order. Certainly not all men are created equal, but all Russian workers are, and by convincing them to abandon their delusional belief that foreigners should be treated the same as Russians, we will be rewarded with a large base of experienced politicians in our quest to rebuild Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_lessons_from_the_late_puppetmaster_desc:0 "Serov disagreed with Suslov on many things, but he had to admit, his rival had a real head for politicking. If Serov could emulate some of Suslov's methods, it would go a long way towards fulfilling Serov's dream of an orderly, Socialist Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_back_to_the_past_desc:0 "Russia is a sick country. The Motherland is bitterly divided, and her people are fearful and in want, easy prey to the traitors and parasites that feast upon her sickened body. Taboritsky tells us it wasn't always like this. Under the Holy Tsar, he says, the Russians walked the path of righteousness. Everyone knew their place in the world and did their duty to the Motherland and for that, she wielded immense wealth and power. Taboritsky wants us to improve our wretched condition, return to the natural order and step back on the path of righteousness. Once we return to the traditional way of things, he promises, the glories of the past will return to us.\n\nDoes the future of Russia lie in the past?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_consolidate_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Many in Komi share our desire for a return to Monarchy, but not all of them support our Presidency. This is folly. Now that we have taken power, the cause of Monarchism is inescapably tied to us - if we should fail, it will fail along with us. We must make Monarchists of every political bent see that we are the only chance they have at seeing their vision for Russia fulfilled: The Holy Tsar restored, reigning in a Russia that has returned to greatness."
 NIK_fashexpansion_alexei_lives_desc:0 "In the early hours of July 17, 1918, the Holy Tsar was murdered by Bolshevik traitors. It was said at the time that his only son and heir, Tsarevich Alexei, was murdered as well. That was a lie. The righteous Tsar lives! Whisked away before the traitors could kill him, and in hiding for almost fifty years now, he awaits the time when Russia has returned to the path of righteousness. Only then he will return and restore the greatness we all knew in the past. Until that time, Sergey Taboritsky will rule in his place as Regent, to unite Russia behind his rule and make the country ready for his return."
 NIK_fashexpansion_strengthen_the_passionariyy_desc:0 "Now that the Passionariyy is in power, the outside elements have outlived their usefulness and only serve to hold us back from our true vision. Let us cut the dead flesh away, so that the living core may grow stronger!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_embolden_the_hardliners_desc:0 "Lev Gumilyov founded the Passionariyy Organization to promote his idea of Eurasia. That idea, and his proposed path towards realizing it, came to lay the foundation for our work. Since then, the organization has come to encompass a much broader range of political thought and groupings, but it is now time to unite around one. If Gumilyov's faction carries the day, they will seek to consolidate the Passionaryy, then lead us to a future where we can rise above petty concerns and regionalisms to pursue their grand vision of United Eurasia. They won't have us emulate either the West or the East, but embrace our position as a bridge between them."
 NIK_fashexpansion_new_nationalism_desc:0 "Nationalism is an important force in the republic and the lands beyond, and strongly felt by its population. Far too often, however, it takes the form of petty regionalism. We are not "Komi" people, nor are we "Russians". We are the beating heart of the Eurasian super-ethnos. We must educate our people of their true place in the world, so that they will fully share in our struggle to realize the great state of United Eurasia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_eurasia_forever_desc:0 "The path to reunification will be long and hard and full of struggle, but we will never falter. Our country is torn apart by petty warlords and traitors, who spouse petty regionalisms to keep our people divided. We will not be fooled by them. Some now say that we should limit our goals, Russia, they say, is our motherland. They are wrong! We have always been greater, the fate of our people always been more glorious, than the dead state of Russia. We will fight on until every petty warlord is beaten, we will fight until every Eurasian is gathered under our banner. We will not rest until our common destiny is realized. Eurasia forever!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_depend_on_the_moderates_desc:0 "Most of our popular support is centered on the moderate wing of our alliance, led by Igor Shafarevich. His promises to respect the republic while reaffirming our national traditions is what sanitized our party to voters beyond the hard core of our constituencies. Adopting his gradualist approach and "national democratic" ideal will maintain support and stability while we implement our ideas."
 NIK_fashexpansion_compassionate_fascism_desc:0 "As the people must serve the state, so must the state serve the people. Our commitment to uphold strict moral values gives us a strong foundation from which to build such a state. Now it's time to build on that foundation. We must ensure our people are warm and safe. We must feed their bellies and their thirst for purpose. We must not think of the work as easy, or of ourselves as infallible, but work gradually and learn from our mistakes. Our values will be the foundation, each successive reform will be a brick, and soon we will have built a grand structure to house all of the republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_an_experimental_dream_desc:0 "Our duty to restore our country to greatness will never be done, and dogmatic adherence to past decisions will only hinder us in our work. While there is a time and place for spectacular action, it is through the many small successes of our day-to-day struggle that we will realize our dreams for tomorrow. We will be pragmatic in how we rule the republic, we will be practical in our day-to-day rule and we will apply the lessons learnt from past failures - both our own and those of others. As long as we remain true to our ethos of compassionate conservatism and informed by the ancient traditions of our nation, we can afford to experiment with policy."
 NIK_fashexpansion_unite_the_party_desc:0 "Our movement is home to a great variety of political groupings, united only by their common rejection of both communism and the status quo in the republic. This breadth has served us well in getting this far, but the cracks between groupings are showing more clearly by the day, and our cohesion suffers as a result. It is time to sharpen our focus. We will reunite the Organization around the alliance at the core of the Passionaryy, the partnership between Igor Shafarevich and Lev Gumilyov. While they disagree on some points, both are used to working with the other, and the two of them together will command a stronger, more focused Passionaryy."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_anti_establishment_alliance_desc:0 "The places of Sergey Taboritsky and Ivan Serov have always been at the fringes of our movement, and with the upcoming convention they are at risk of being sidelined by their more established rivals. Together, they might be able to accomplish what neither can do on their own - scrape together enough support to alter the course of the movement, and take control of the Organization. Surely the most temporary of alliances, as the two men disagree on almost everything except their desire for a substantial change in direction and leadership, the pact needs to hold together long enough to defeat their chief rivals and reduce the running to a two-horse race."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_convention_desc:0 "To an outside observer, the Great Convention of the Passionaryy Organization must be a decidedly odd spectacle. The effort to get a big tent party comprising social conservatives, radical eurasianists, traditional monarchists and everything in between to agree on a shared doctrine is proving to be a challenge. So challenging, in fact, that an alternative proposal for uniting the party is quickly becoming the preferred option. Called the "Convergence", it consists of a vote, to be held at the end of the assembly, to determine the leader of the Organization and the new Head of State."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_final_words_desc:0 "The Convergence looms. Lines are being drawn ever more firmly as the primary leadership candidates make their last appeals to the voting membership. There are no more debates to be had, no more backroom deals to be made. The four men will each make a final speech and then - the decision. The only other question to be decided is who will be the one to speak last. It's the most desired position in the order of speeches by all four candidates, and whoever secures it will have gained both the prestige of a small victory and the perceived benefit of having the last word before the vote. Who will it be?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_convergence_desc:0 "The final speeches have been held, and it is time for the Convergence to take place. Four men will enter the National Assembly as candidates, each hoping to emerge from the vote as president, ready to guide the Passionaryy to achieve their vision. Only one will succeed. With everything now at stake, tensions are running high. The candidates have all committed to respect the assembly, but it's anyone's guess how long that respect goes should the tide turn against them."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_focus_on_methods_desc:0 "The breadth of thought in our movement extends to political strategy. While there is a general agreement we need to be diligent in managing public support and opposition, what measures we should use and where our focus should be is proving a difficult discussion. Some believe that information campaigns about our great work should be enough to keep the public on our side. Others propose we tie ourselves much more strongly to the Orthodox Church. There is also support for campaigns to suppress dissent and opposition more forcefully, with disagreement centering more on the proposed extent and violence of them. It is time to make a decision."
 NIK_fashexpansion_draft_a_constitution_desc:0 "In order to strengthen our hold on the republic and guide it to a better future, we should draft a new constitution. This will mark a break with the corrupt old order and let us show the republic our good intentions. That the drafting process will show us where the prominent voices in our organization land on key issues, and who in our organization commands the influence to push their favorite clauses through is just an added benefit, of course."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_united_left_desc:0 "There's little love lost between Ivan Serov and Igor Shafarevich. If there ever was a time for the two men to bury the hatchet, however, it is now. Every day, the cracks in our movement are becoming more apparent, and the looming reckoning more clear. If the prospect of losing a power struggle was not enough to make bedfellows of the two, the men they would be losing to will be. Lev Gumilyov and Sergey Taboritsky have enough grandiose delusions between them to equip a ward full of mental patients. Combined with influence, power and a lack of scruples, either could do great damage to the republic."

The cleansing fire of our divinely-mandated rule must burn away these impurities and make way for His Imperial Majesty before all hope is lost."
 NIK_burgsys_uplift_the_system_desc:0 "축복은 민족사회주의의 검은 가리개를 뒤집어쓰고 이 세상에 나타났습니다. 절대적이고 불문의 독재권위에 근거한 이 체제는 '카우카지엔'이라 그들에게 알려진 독일 전진기지에서 그 실례를 내보였습니다. 당연히 그곳은 정당한 러시아령이지만, 독일인 통치자인 국가판무관 요지아스는 진정으로 인상적인 존재를 빚어냈습니다. 열등인간들이 체계적으로 억압당하며 독일인들의 인종적 우월을 위해 절멸당하는 국가 말입니다.\n\n이 얼마나 기발한 창조물이란 말입니까! 분명 하느님께선 이 요지아스를 통해 행동하시어 우리에게 러시아의 영광을 되찾을 길을 보여주고 계신 겁니다. 이 '부르군트 체제'를 우리의 필요에 맞추어 바꾸고 적절히 활용한다면, 섭정과 차례비치의 통치는 무너지지 않을 겁니다. 동시에 그로써, 불순한 인종들을 러시아에서 청소해내 진정한 지배인종을 영원히 지켜내도록 해줄 것입니다!"
 NIK_burgsys_reform_the_okhrana_desc:0 "We are locked in an eternal struggle with forces too terrible for godly men to truly comprehend. The world sinks deeper and deeper into the muck of degeneracy with each passing day. Only the actions of a brave few men - such as the Regent - keep it from being swallowed up by the darkness.\n\nBut the Regent cannot bear the burden alone. He needs good, reliable servants - trustworthy men pure of heart and intent. As Providence has shown us through the Burgundian System, only a legion of such men, backed with the iron will of the Regent, are capable of maintaining order. The Okhrana, risen from the dead, shall be Russia's shadow-clad bulwark against all evil."
 NIK_burgsys_imperskiye_shturmoviki_desc:0 "The sinful people of Russia have been afflicted such by decades of Judeo-Bolshevik rule that they no longer understand what is best for them. The Regent's laws are but suggestions to the misguided; the only language most of them are able to comprehend is force.\n\nTo carry out the solemn duty of impressing the Regent's divine mandate upon the people, a new army must be raised. This will be no motley band of soldiers, polluted by sin and earthly desires, but an order of the brave, the strong and the pure. They shall be the Regent's strong right arm, dispensing justice with bullet and bayonet to the traitors and undesirables within our realm."
 NIK_burgsys_eyes_in_every_house_desc:0 "Tragically, few Russians understand the importance or even the nature of the Regent's holy work. Unwittingly inspired by the Jewish enemy, they shy away from God's light and conceal their secrets beneath a veil of lies. There, away from sight, they fester and rot, spreading a foul contagion that poisons the very soul of Russia.\n\nFortunately, there remains a sliver of light in even the most benighted souls. With the clink of coins and the click of a cocked gun, the people of Russia can be lured or nudged onto the correct path. With a little persistence, all the dark secrets of the lowly shall be revealed, and the Regent's faithful servants will see them expunged."
 NIK_burgsys_improve_on_our_knowledge_desc:0 "Loyal, observant watchmen are a blessing to the Regent, but they are still human - still imperfect. We cannot grow complacent in our trust of them, for the flesh is weak and the human heart filled to bursting with sin. Only the greatest among us are truly safe from the Devil's temptations.\n\nBut the machine has none of these flaws. Steel, copper and plastic might corrode, but they will never betray us or fail in their duty. Wire-taps, surveillance cameras, hidden microphones - these marvels of technology will grant the Regent a sliver of the Lord's own omniscience and omnipresence. So armed, our sacred peace is assured."
 NIK_burgsys_honor_the_blessed_regent_desc:0 "Some place their trust in money. Some place their trust in weapons of war. Some, wretched beyond all others, place their trust in the iconoclasm of ideology. We, of all the world's nations, know better.\n\nWe, the Russians, place our trust in Sergey Taboritsky, Blessed Regent of His Imperial Majesty Tsarevich Alexei Romanov, true heir to the Russian Empire. Anointed with the blood of unbelievers, his reign is divinely mandated by the Lord God and eternally sanctioned in the name of Christ. The Lord has chosen him as His vessel and the harbinger of the Empire's return to glory, carrying forth the eternal light of the Third Rome. Only the Regent has been imparted with the Lord's own wisdom and power - only he can truly claim legitimacy over all the Russias. So shall it be until the Tsarevich is found and restored to his rightful throne!"
 NIK_burgsys_imperial_artwork_desc:0 "Russia's culture, once the pure inheritor of Rome's legacy, has been polluted to the point that the Regent weeps to even behold it. A thousand different and equally degenerate influences now sully every form of art in our beautiful nation. Worst of all are the idolatrous and perverse scrawlings of the Bolsheviks, venerating the proletarian rabble and their abominable, atheistic state above all else.\n\nTrue art, directly from the halcyon years of the Romanovs, is the only acceptable expression of Russian culture. All Bolshevik filth must be scourged away with fire, along with the scribblings of vile writers like Pasternak, the Jewish infiltrator."
 NIK_burgsys_cult_of_the_tsarevich_desc:0 "Wherever Tsarevich Alexei is hiding, surely he is living a most blessed life. Raised by gentle, caring men of God, he has certainly been instilled with all the virtues of a great and holy ruler. More than that, he carries the sanctified blood of his martyred father within his veins, setting him above all other men. Even among the racially superior of the world, he must be the most exemplary specimen.\n\nAll the people of Russia should know this, from the lowliest peasant to the highest noble. The Tsarevich is the sacred prince promised directly to our Regent by the Lord. He shall be as glorious and perfect in form and mind as Christ himself, King of Kings and Ruler of Rulers. Our Golden Child, our Blessed Prince of Longing - all of Russia shall know of your glory, from now 'til Judgement Day. Your Regent shall ensure that none ever heed the voice of Satan and defy you as the Jew-Tatar Lenin did. By enshrining the Regent's unworthy, earthly authority, the stage shall forever be set for you to assume the throne in perpetual, unquestioned peace."
 NIK_burgsys_trustworthy_court_desc:0 "Every Tsar must have his court; so must regents, logically. We have accumulated a vast number of devoted followers over the decades, from wizened White emigres to youthful radicals bursting with vigor. The true path illuminated so many years ago by Regent Taboritsky is now walked by thousands of the faithful.\n\nYet the situation is not as it should be. We have heard disturbing rumors from our little birds who keep watch on the ambitious and the powerful. It seems that certain inclinations have begun to take root recently; inclinations towards dissent, heresy... even treachery. Unfortunate, but villainous courtiers have ever been the lot of good-hearted rulers. Adjustments shall be made, so that Tsarevich Alexei will never face such a threat. Once the fate of traitors becomes known, fear shall permanently cow those who aspired to follow in their footsteps."
 NIK_burgsys_fall_of_the_favorite_desc:0 "The Regent walks in Christ's footsteps, lighting the way for Russia to follow. He is no Messiah, but he does strive to emulate one. It is not surprising, then, that another man would strive to emulate Judas: Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, an old and dear friend, has become a most problematic element in the imperial court. Speaking with the forked tongue of Satan, he has dared to confront the Regent with 'concerns about his increasingly erratic behaviour'.\n\nCould the machinations of Beelzebub be any more obvious? This is the prelude to a betrayal most foul - no doubt Shabelsky-Bork already has his thirty pieces of silver! All he needs now is a rope of straw that he might be sent, blue-faced and choking, to the same eternal prison as his infernal master. In his place, a younger, more godly man shall be elevated to become the right hand of the Regent."
 NIK_burgsys_towards_absolute_purity_desc:0 "It is not enough for those who rule to be pure of heart. The lands of Russia are infested with a multitude of vermin: Jews, Tatars, Asiatics. These parasites suckle themselves on the lifeblood of the Empire, growing fat and healthy at the expense of God's chosen people.\n\nNo longer shall the noisome presence of subhumans be tolerated in our holy empire. Time and again, they have betrayed Russia, always pursuing the allure of wealth and self-aggrandizement. After every betrayal, they beg and plea for their miserable lives, appealing to the good Christian morals of their rightful rulers. Many were thus deceived, but not the Regent. For all their faults, the Germans, guided by God, have shown us the way. With bullets, blades, fire and gas, we shall forever cleanse Russia of its enemies."
 NIK_burgsys_repurpose_the_gulags_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks, perfidious Jews that they are, have devised many tools with which to oppress God's chosen people. None were so cruel and dehumanizing as the gulags: prison camps in the forgotten reaches of Russia where countless millions were sent to starve or freeze to death in the name of revolution.\n\nHowever, their wicked schemes shall be their final undoing. We shall take their precious gulags from them, round up the subhuman traitors, and drive them into the depths of their own creations! There, they shall toil away until they die, all to our benefit! Turning the weapons of the enemy against him is of grave danger to one's soul - but it is nevertheless a most satisfying thing to do."
 NIK_burgsys_ray_of_light_desc:0 "The only thing that subhumans hate more than the good and the pure is their own kind. The Germans demonstrated that well during their conquests; Ukrainians, Balts and Poles were easily manipulated by their new masters into turning their aggressions against the Jewish rats infesting their lands. Why, if not for such unwitting collaboration, the Germans might never have enjoyed such a high degree of success.\n\nWe have learned this lesson well. The inferior races of Russia will be shown the faces of their true oppressors and given a little encouragement. Spurred on by their base, primitive urges, they will no doubt busy themselves with infighting. That will diminish their numbers and make our task far easier to carry out."
 NIK_burgsys_harsh_glare_desc:0 "The Regent's people need no collaborators or stooges to help bear their burden. Russia has always stood by itself - a lone tree standing defiant against ill winds. Our virtues and strength are all we need to triumph over the subhumans.\n\nWe shall prove it. Jews, Tatars, Kalmyks, Komi, Udmurts, Buryats - none are a match for the iron will of the Russians. They will be rounded up, incarcerated and exterminated down to the last of their mewling, demonic spawn. Some may question our right to slaughter millions; those who understand realize that we have no right to let them live!"
 NIK_burgsys_bounties_on_parasites_desc:0 "The Regent, blessed as he may be, is not possessed of the Lord's omnipresence. Though he wishes it were not so, he cannot spare the time to be directly involved in the righteous purgation of our lands. In his stead, loyal servants must act - but there is a distinct shortage of such individuals. The commoners must be encouraged to serve him, so that they are prepared to do the same for the Tsarevich.\n\nFor this to happen, they must first be convinced of the necessity of our ideals. The fastest way to a man's heart is by satisfying his material needs, and Russia has so, so many people in dire need. Perhaps incentivizing involvement in our racial holy war would suffice... backed up by necessary reminders of the importance of this mission. After all, he who allows the subhuman to live shares in the crime of its existence."
 NIK_burgsys_glorious_new_day_desc:0 "What we have accomplished here in the west is only the beginning. From this old heartland of the Empire, the light of our Lord and His earthly representative, Tsarevich Alexei, will shine forth. Soon, it shall illuminate all of Russia, from Malorossiya to Vladivostok. The subhumans will be utterly destroyed and the pure race never again threatened by their ilk.\n\nBut not yet. There is so much more to do, so many evils to vanquish and souls to save. Beyond our borders, false claimants to the rulership of Russia send forth their armies to oppose us. Foolishly, they dismiss our claim to divine sponsorship, refusing to even acknowledge the truth of the Tsarevich's existence. They are wrong, of course, and will know it once we cast them into Hell and establish the eternal Holy Russian Empire across the entirety of its rightful lands!"
 
 NIK_burgsys_wealth_of_russia_desc:0 "United, Russia would be the largest and wealthiest nation in all of creation. Great swathes of verdant agricultural land stretch from Ukraine to the depths of Eurasia. Beneath the earth, there is a veritable bounty of mineral resources: iron, coal, gold and a thousand more gifts of God besides. Standing above it all, ready to exploit and be exploited in turn, are countless millions of the faithful, meat for the grinder.\n\nSadly, the majority of Russia is out of our reach for now. The Regency must make do with what the Lord has provided us. The entirety of our land's wealth must be put to use immediately and with maximum possible efficiency to begin the reclamation of the lands beyond the Urals."
 NIK_burgsys_tear_down_their_failures_desc:0 "Nowhere is the degeneracy and failure of Bolshevism more apparent than in its architecture and industry. Hideous concrete edifices, shrines to their inhumanity, litter Russia's idyllic lands. What use is any of this if it fails to adequately glorify Russia and its God?\n\nThere is no other option - it all has to go. It must be torn down and pulverized to dust, with hammers, saws, dynamite... even artillery if necessary. The Lord will never bless our economic endeavours if we permit Red blasphemy to continue existing in any form. The sooner we carry out this cleansing, the more certain we can be of His favor."
 NIK_burgsys_imperial_corporations_desc:0 "Predictably, the remnants of the Bolshevik economy we have inherited are nothing short of pathetic. Their obsession with ensuring adherence to their mad ideology only impoverished the people of Russia and made them easy prey for the Germans. Little better were their limited attempts at capitalism in a red guise - any man of God knows that capitalists are a threat to the proper hierarchy of a godly society.\n\nWith the Regent's guidance, such pitfalls will be avoided. Total state control is necessary, but turning God's people against one another will achieve little. Let the nobles have their riches, as they deserve, and remind the common folk of the shared duty of the classes. Let Red 'commissariats' and liberal 'free enterprise' give way to the good sense and responsibility of the Imperial Charter Corporations. That is how it always should have been."

The Bolsheviks never exploited this properly - the Lord saw their degenerate atheism and concealed the greatest of creation's riches from their crude machines.\n\nHowever, the land is now worked by God's chosen people! We have thus found no shortage of vital resources such as tungsten, aluminum and iron. These material blessings must be unearthed as quickly and efficiently as possible; thankfully, we have no shortage of strong backs to carry the task out, as well as subhuman fodder for the riskiest work. Only with the mines and pits stripped bare can the Regent see his holy mission fulfilled!"

Scheming Jews who plied the wicked trade of moneylending; steppe-dwelling barbarians who pillaged our homes; uppity peasants who forgot their place in society.\n\nThese parasites, and any others of their like, will no longer be permitted to hoard their ill-gotten gains while the Empire is left wanting. Their 'property' is now God's - and, therefore, the Regent's. It shall finally be put to good use, fuelling the reconstruction of a pure, holy Russia while the thieves and subhumans of the world do their penance in mines and factories."

Why does he need a fine town house, with gilded furniture and a necklace of pearls for his humble wife? What use are any of these things in the face of eternal damnation?\n\nAll the common man needs is provided for him already by the Lord, who created the proper and sanctified order of things. Hard work, prayer, family, absolute faith in God and the Tsar - these things were given unto him by Heaven, and they are not his to reject. This is the rightful lot of all the common folk, and the Regent will see this divine order maintained at any cost."
 NIK_burgsys_grand_industrial_project_desc:0 "As we are a pious, ascetic nation, we have no need of mass-produced trinkets and baubles to keep the plebeian folk amused. Thus, all the space that would be occupied by light industry and selfish capitalist ventures remains free - free, specifically, for the enormous amounts of heavy industry that we require to make Russia great again.\n\nArms factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, foundries and quarries are all needed to ignite the fires of industry. All of it, from the smallest operation to the grandest factory complex, will be directed solely towards forging the greatest army Russia has ever seen. Until the Tsarevich reigns supreme over a godly and peaceful land, nothing else is worthy of our efforts."

These new buildings will be designed from the most basic level to glorify God, Russia and the Tsarevich.\n\nAll other concerns are secondary. Whether our new factories and facilities appear safe or practical to the scaled eyes of heretics and traitors is irrelevant. The Regent speaks with God's own voice, and he assures the people that so long as they have faith, they need never fear the dangers that blight the industry of lesser nations. If a man loses his arm in a thresher, or is cooked alive in a blast of steam, he only has himself to blame for lacking sufficient faith in God's protection."
 NIK_burgsys_cathedrals_of_industry_desc:0 "If modern industry has a major shortcoming, it is the total absence of religion. When workers are toiling their hours away, their ears are filled only with the clamor of machinery. As their hands are so occupied with honest work, so too should their ears be open to holy benedictions and hymns, to soothe their spirits and remind them that laboring for the Regent is a sacred duty.\n\nBut that's not enough. The arms and equipment churned out by our factories will be worse than useless if they are not adequately blessed. For our army to gain the Lord's favor, their gear must be consecrated in His name, and there is no better place to do this than at the source. By assigning a priest to every factory, the proper rites can be conducted and our weapons imbued with divine purpose."

We already have a decent flow of this black gold from sources such as Ukhta, but we need more. Much more.\n\nSurveyors have already found trace amounts in our land; if there are any wellsprings hiding beneath the earth, they must be opened up immediately. God has given the Empire the means to keep its oil industry independent from the Elders of Zion and their Mahometan puppets. The fuel for our engines of war will be just as pure as the pious Russians who drew it forth."

Trade is naturally out of the question, since it brings with it the risk of Jewish infiltration. Thankfully, there are a number of answers to the money question within our borders.\n\nNaturally, we shall further the practice of seizing property. Russia has no shortage of wicked plutocrats who deserve none of what they possess. There could also be many commoners, some secretly Jewish no doubt, who possess concealed fortunes built up over the years. Whatever the source, it all belongs to the Empire!"

Everything of value will be accounted for and placed in the hands of the wise and worthy.\n\nLogically, without any funds going to waste, the Empire will be economically invincible. We will always have enough treasure to keep the coffers topped up and the army fed. God and His Regent will take care of the rest."

Jealousy is an easily-roused emotion, particularly for intellectually stunted commoners.\n\nWhat they failed to understand is that opulence is only a bad thing when it represents a sinful love of materialism; for example, the overwrought townhouse of a scheming Jew stuffed with gilded furniture. Contrasting this, the opulence associated with imperial rule is perfectly logical and has divine approval. The Lord demands that His temple be the most splendid and beautiful building on earth; as His living representative, the Tsar (and therefore the Regent) is clearly the intended benefactor of this decree."
 NIK_burgsys_black_budget_desc:0 "Modern economics are utterly farcical. What use have God and His people for nebulous, flawed and purely man-made terminology? Why should we even pay attention to the words of money-obsessed men in a profession infested with Jews?\n\nThe Regent is possessed of the Lord's sacred wisdom and knows all the world's truths. There are no flaws or errors in our economic programs or policies. Everything has been perfectly calculated with the aid of divine revelation. All that lesser men need to know is this: the economic affairs of the Empire are the exclusive domain of the Regent and his chosen few. Anybody else who attempts to involve themselves is nothing more than Judeo-Bolshevik agitator and will be dealt with appropriately."
 NIK_burgsys_absolute_truth_desc:0 "Foreigners - mostly Jewish and Masonic puppets, we suspect - frequently wonder aloud how our economy can ever be sustainable. How, without embracing trade with the perfidious subhumans of the world, are we to endure?\n\nThe answer is obvious to all but the most truly stupid people. Gold. Gold is all humanity has ever needed to form the bedrock of an economy. It has been that way for thousands of years, and is ordained by God. Furthermore, we have plenty of it. There are massive vaults, far from the clammy grasp of avaricious Jews, that are filled to bursting with gold and other valuables. This is all we need, and all we shall ever need. How else can one possibly explain our productivity?"
 NIK_burgsys_virtuous_education_desc:0 "Last but not least of our concerns are the minds of our children. The youths of Russia have long been deprived of a proper education by Judeo-Bolshevik oppression; truly, the Elders of Zion know no limits to their demented schemes.\n\nThe Regent sees their plight and has heard their cries for help. Now, the children of Russia shall have what they need: proper education, from cradle to grave, formulated by the Regent himself for maximum efficiency. It is only right for them to learn every minutiae necessary, that they might correctly serve the Tsarevich when he ascends to the throne. Tended properly, he will never have to hear unwanted questions from a rowdy and ill-minded populace."

It is from academia, not the peasantry, that corruptive ideas of equality, Bolshevism and capitalism emerged. They are a perpetual fifth column, a thorn in the side of Russia spreading a vile infection. No longer.\n\nThe only rational and moral solution is a nation-wide purge of these dissidents. Anyone who cannot prove that he is with us in totality is against us - and the Regent has no mercy for the enemies of God. Once they have received their just punishment, a new intellectual order shall be founded on their bones: an order dedicated to true science, purified of demonic materialism."

Such rabble are undeserving of the Regent's command.\n\nIn their place, the Imperial Army will finally return after nearly fifty years of its absence. It will not be quite the same institution; the weaknesses that plagued it and contributed to its many defeats must be excised. There will be many trials ahead for our reborn empire and the Imperial Army will be the spine that keeps it standing upright. None shall find them wanting."

Lesser claimants to rulership might be swayed by the honeyed lies of Cain's kindred, but the Regent understands that the only valid law is God's. There are no boundaries created by man that cannot be crossed in service of Holy Russia.\n\nThe protests of the feeble and the heathen will no longer be heeded. Chemical weapons are God's gift to the armies of Christendom and no less central to our doctrine than guns, planes and tanks. Once again, they will have their rightful place as standard-issue weapons for the entire military."
 NIK_burgsys_through_the_fog_desc:0 "Knowledge is power. Only through extensive monitoring of our internal situation do we keep subversives at bay and thus continue to enjoy the Lord's favor. The same is true of our military situation.\n\nOur enemies are far better at concealing themselves from the Regent's burning gaze than the common folk are, but nothing can hide them forever. God has granted man many gifts that allow us to share in His omniscience: sonar, radar and encryption, just to name a few. The Imperial Army must have access to all of these and more, so that it can never be blindsided by our wicked foes."

However, after running a tally of its inventory, we have found that current supplies are inadequate for regular use.\n\nBut the Lord provides. In a sealed section of the vaults, concealed from the sight of the sinful, we found the greatest gift of all: a supplied and fully functional chemical weapons production plant. Though the facility is small, the acquisition of base ingredients for the creation of gas is a simple matter. Production can therefore almost immediately. The facility is also quite old, and therefore relatively easy to duplicate. Praise God for bestowing such fruits of Heaven upon us!"
 NIK_burgsys_clouds_on_the_horizon_desc:0 "Though the Germans enjoyed overwhelming success in their invasion of the Soviet Union, they never went far enough. Perhaps they lacked the stomach, or simply the foresight, to ensure the total pacification of their conquests. Yes, their columns of Panzers, Stukas and gray-clad infantry were impressive. But what if they had embraced the glorious horror of chemical warfare? How many lives could have been saved and degenerates exterminated, if every assault was preceded by a storm of gas-spewing shells, and every defense bolstered with an invisible wall of phosgene?\n\nThe Regent and his army will hold no such reservations. For the preservation of the pure and the utter extermination of the wicked, the liberal use of gas and smoke on the battlefield will be mandated. Protected by the best-quality gas masks and armed with the finest weapons available, Russia's army will be as a legion of avenging angels, scourging the land of Satan's minions."
 NIK_burgsys_officers_for_the_reclamation_desc:0 "Loyal officers are hard to come by in these times. Officers loyal to the Regent and Empire, harder still. Most professional army men are 'former' Bolsheviks or self-serving mercenaries at heart. They can barely be tolerated in our community of the faithful, let alone trusted with command.\n\nStill, the Lord will guide His servant, as he always has. Perhaps we should turn from the established officer corps and look to the ranks of the faithful for promising candidates. They will need to be strong-willed and pure of heart. More importantly, they must be able to pass our new loyalty tests, instituted just recently by the Regent himself. The cream will always rise to the top in the end."
 NIK_burgsys_lessons_from_the_past_desc:0 "The Soviets lost primarily due to their degeneracy, but almost as important a factor was their tactics - or lack thereof. Jewish brainwashing totally destroyed the ability of their leaders to think rationally, leaving the Red Army little more than a flock of headless chickens. The common soldiery were no better, stripped of independent thought by years of communist indoctrination. All they could do was throw themselves at the Germans in human waves; a fitting end, but laughably ineffective.\n\nWe are not so foolish. The Russian Empire was never militarily defeated in the Great War; it was brought down from within by the knives of Judas. The brilliance of White Army heroes like Kornilov and Denikin is indisputable, and will be the foundation of our new tactical doctrines. The wisdom of the old Empire will guide us to victory everlasting!"

We have our chemical weapons, but they are of Soviet or even old imperial vintage. We cannot expect them to remain useful in their current form forever.\n\nResearch and development initiatives must begin at once, at the Regent's command. Germany alone could teach us much, but true genius will be only found in the minds of the Regent's chosen. Already, our brilliant engineers and scientists, aided by the Holy Spirit, have proposed a dozen new solutions to the needs of our holy warriors. Ballistic missiles loaded with sarin gas... just one of many ideas that must have been inspired by God himself!"

In our veins flows the blood of Heraclius, Justinian and Constantine the Great. No matter how deprived or misfortunate we might be, we will always remain God's chosen warriors and the purest race in all Creation.\n\nThe Regent decrees that all good people of Russia be made aware of this fact. War is in our blood; within every able-bodied Russian man dwells the martial might of the Archangel Michael! That will be decisively proven, even if every man capable of firing a gun has to be conscripted and scourged until he finds his fighting spirit! In an ideal world, it would never come to that, but mere propaganda may not be enough..."

By inveigling itself amongst our race, its spawn take on more Russian physical attributes with each generation. Any one of our soldiers could be a hidden Jew, spreading sentiments of disloyalty and pacifism amongst his intellectually vulnerable comrades.\n\nThanks to God's protection, however, the new Imperial Army will be immune to this. Infiltrators will surface from time to time, but they cannot hide for long. A focus on instilling loyalty, piety and ferocity in battle into the men will both improve our army's quality and fumigate the ranks. In time, the naturally deviant tendencies of the Jew will cause it to inadvertently reveal itself, at which point it can be rooted out and put to the torch. Thus will the eternal faith and glory of the Imperial Army be maintained."

The innate superiorities of our race require some coaxing to fully manifest themselves. This is best achieved through a combination of martial education and intense physical training.\n\nTaking notes from the SS, our recruits will be put through the most gruelling, brutal, merciless training programs our generals can conceive. A pure-blooded Russian can endure any level of human suffering imaginable and come out stronger. Even the slightest amount of subhuman blood will cause them to 'wash out' - but that's no great loss. In fact, it only makes the Regent's work easier. The blood always knows."

Some are even branded with that most unspeakable of horrors: the Mark of Cain!\n\nNaturally, we will act at once. Perhaps these men thought that their theft of Russian blood would allow them to propagate their corrupted lineage and ideals without our notice. It matters not. From now on, each and every man who joins the Imperial Army must have his bloodline verified as pure, and his upbringing proven free of Jewish or barbarian taint."

All we ever need will be produced in Russia, by Russian hands through which the Holy Spirit works. Not even the finest German industrial complexes can produce weapons to match ours.

If He had not done so, how could the Germans possibly have achieved such success in the air during the Second World War?\n\nIf the gift of flight is so widespread that even Bolsheviks can make use of it now, then we must embrace it wholeheartedly! The Regent wishes for an Imperial Air Force to be established post-haste. He also demands that research into modern plane designs and aerial tactics be made a priority. Clearly, God has granted him a spark of divine brilliance again!"

One shudders to even imagine the sheer power this will provide our military. Villages of subhuman savages pacified without a shot being fired; columns of men swallowed up by choking clouds of mustard gas; entire cities purged of their degenerate inhabitants by a storm of air-dropped sarin bombs! Truly, God must be smiling upon us this day!"

The nation lay shattered, and the unity between the Russian people was subsumed under the subordination by the elite.\n\nNow that he has come to power in the Republic of Ust-Sysolsk, President Shafarevich has ideas as to how to revive and rejuvenate Russia. Key to his plans is his ideology, that of "Compassionate Conservatism." No longer shall the peoples of Russia be driven against one another by a difference in ideals and class, all shall be one, as God had intended.

After the Convergence, however, all of these factions fused into one, hitherto unnamed entity. All of the Passionaryy, with its partisanship and ideological differences, now belong under Shafarevich's thumb.\n\nThis is not a time for division.

Russia is not an ordered house - it's current troubles exacerbate this chaos.\n\nAs such, the President shall promulgate a return to the natural state of things, untainted by the toxic past.

 NIK_natsoc_the_ordosocialist_revolution_desc:0 "Ordosocialism has prevailed in Western Russia! The superiority of our ideology has been affirmed, and all that's left is to reconquer Russia. Unfortunately, in order to be able to embark upon such a mission, we must first reorganize the state in accordance with Ordosocialist doctrine. We had neglected to do so earlier, in the hopes that the people would fall in line and work with the party, but it appears we were mistaken. The rot of the Suslov and his cosmopolitan illusions reeks still, and if we are to bring Russia back to its former glory and power, it must be cleansed, purified by fire, possibly by firing squad if need be."
 NIK_natsoc_the_party_order_desc:0 "One must be organized in every endeavor one embarks upon. In this case, we will start with a list. The list will start small, but slowly, as we hear or notice things about the people working in the government, that list will grow. These things might be relatively minor, like the use of certain words or maybe a manner of speech, to egregious things, like professing an interest in a reactionary ideology or even questioning the great Serov. Once that list is complete, we will create another list. This list will have the names of all the people about whom we noticed things. That list will be handed off to a military officer, and then we will no longer have to worry about such people."
 NIK_natsoc_the_dialectics_of_masses_desc:0 "Our ultimate goal must be, above all other things, to serve the people. And, in order to serve the people, we must understand what the people want. To that end, we will create mass party organizations, with which we shall engage the general populace. These organizations will penetrate society, bringing vast sections of society into the party's net, as well as allowing us a view into the conditions and circumstances in which our people find themselves in. The information we gather will be used to create a plan of action based on these ideas and concerns of the people rooted in Ordosocialism, with the intent of relieving any problems they might have. Hopefully, this will strengthen the party's relationship with the masses."
 NIK_natsoc_the_hand_in_a_velvet_glove_desc:0 "A state lacking the ability to control its people, lacks the ability to be a state at all. We must expand our network of informants and agents in order to match the pace at which our nation is expanding. Western Russia houses a lot of people, many of which may harbor ill intent to our benevolent regime. In order to amend this, not only must our clandestine agency grow in size, but it must also grow in influence. Our officers and agents must become more active and involved. There should be an officer in every school and an agent in every home. Such a presence will take time and effort, but the results will be well worth it. After all, all we do, we do for the people."
 NIK_natsoc_the_guiding_star_desc:0 "Ivan Serov is the axis upon which our state spins. He is center stage, the leading man, the guiding light towards which we all gravitate. Sadly, not all see our leader the way we do. Some see him as a tyrant, a monster, even insane. We must do our part to rectify the hearts and minds of these people, and expose the truth about Serov to them. Posters will be printed and hung up, hymns written and sung, and monuments built and dedicated to him. All will know and acknowledge his greatness, and those who don't, or refuse to, will simply no longer be allowed to be a part of this nation."
 NIK_natsoc_the_dictatorship_of_a_newer_type_desc:0 "Without a clear leader and structure, we cannot hope to succeed in our goals of reuniting Russia and bringing it into the future. The party will be reorganized into a single, centralized, mechanized apparatus from which all orders will come down. The lower echelons of this structure will be most directly in contact with the populace, and will work to implement any laws or orders, effectively acting as a bureaucracy. The upper echelons of the party, culminating in our leader Serov, will assess the data and make decisions based on said information, ultimately acting for the benefit of Russia."
 NIK_natsoc_the_national_pride_of_great_russians_desc:0 "Russia is a race of proud, strong men and women. For the last thousand years we have suffered, possibly more than any other peoples in history. Famine, winter, plague, and invasion arrived at our doorstep at one point or another, and time and time again we Russians have endured. There is no race of people so great in all the world, certainly not those traitorous dogs who hold Moscow across the border. At one time, our empire was the largest in all the world, and in time, this will be true again."
 NIK_natsoc_heroes_of_the_past_desc:0 "Russia has a vast and extensive history, one which should be respected and studied. From the Teutonic invasion of the thirteenth century to the Napoleonic wars of the nineteenth to the Great War of decades past, Russia has endured and shall continue to endure into the future. It's important that we remember these heroes of Russia's past and understand how they brought Russia to greatness. Our ancestors did much to make Russia what it once was, and, following in their footsteps, we shall do the same, under the great banner of Ordosocialism."
 NIK_natsoc_revolutionaries_of_the_future_desc:0 "If we are to teach a new generation of revolutionaries for the future, we must first regale them with stories of revolutionaries of the past. We must reintroduce Marxist teachings into the education curriculum so that our youngest will understand the basis of Ordosocialism and become better citizens of the state. We will teach them of Lenin and his great crusade against the Tsar, the folly of Bukharin and NEP, and the rise of a new Russian state, our Ordosocialist state. These students are to be the future of Russia, let's be sure to teach them well."
 NIK_natsoc_the_state_forming_nation_desc:0 "Russia, though more divided and separate than it has been in generations, retains one key aspect that no other nation on this Earth can claim. We are Russian. Russia is, in and of itself, exceptional in nature, and the future of this world is inherently intertwined with the future of Russia. When Russia is once again reunited, this time under Ordosocialism, we will assume our role as vanguard against all the evils of the world, whether that be facism, capitalism, or cosmopolitanism. From the ashes, our Russian state will arise anew."
 NIK_natsoc_the_socialist_unitarism_desc:0 "The federative institutions that marked the old Soviet regime have no place in our new nation. No only is such a system of governance inefficient, but it is also a threat to the party. By allowing regional governments to govern themselves under a federal setup, we invite the chance for said governments to work against us, to plot in secret, even to rebel. We mustn't allow it. Additionally, a unitary government will allow for more efficient use of resources and a simplified management of the economy, as all executive decision making and bureaucratic implementation is centralized."
 NIK_natsoc_the_russian_union_desc:0 "With the Soviet Union of old destroyed, we have been granted an opportunity to reshape what the foundation of what the Soviet Union can even be. Our new Soviet nation will, at its core, be a Russian nation first and foremost. Suslov's ideas of a union in which all races are equal is simply unfeasible, given the inherent superiority of the Russian people. These illusions of equality between the races of the Soviet Union is partially what led to its collapse in the first place. Thus, if a new Soviet Union is to be created, it must be created with the Russian people at its core ruling the nation."
 NIK_natsoc_the_national_unity_desc:0 "Ordosocialism, while already having been extremely successful in its spread across Russia thus far, is rather undefined. That is to say, while the broad strokes of the ideology have been explored, such as the ideas of Russian supremacy and preeminence of the state in society, we have no ideological aspirations. It's easy to say that we should reunite Russia and reconquer Moscowien, ending German influence in Russia once and for all, but what of after? What will our new Russia look like? How should the Russian people strive to be? We must answer these questions."
 NIK_natsoc_the_revolutionary_succession_desc:0 "Despite what others have said about our ideology, Ordosocialism is very much a leftist ideology. We should embrace this revolutionary, progressive, and socialist identity and use it to our advantage. There are still many who yearn for the old Soviet Union, and believe in the old ways of communism. By embracing the leftist nature of our ideology, we might be able to reach out and integrate them into the cause. Whether they be former Suslovites, hardcore communists, or moderate socialists, we welcome them all with open arms."
 NIK_natsoc_our_own_way_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that in the earlier years of reunification, proponents of Ordosocialism had to align themselves with right wing groups in order to carry out our ideological goals. Unfortunately, such groups have become a thorn in our side as we have begun to consolidate our political power under Serov. They project the image that the party isn't unified in its goals and ideals, and that projects weakness. They will have to be expelled from the party, and should they continue to be so vocal about their views on Ordosocialism after they leave, then we will have to use other means to deal with them."
 NIK_natsoc_red_white_reconciliation_desc:0 "Ordosocialism isn't one monolithic mode of thought or ideology. It is an ideology with the capacity to change and adapt. In this case, in order to further the party's interests and influence in Russia at large, we will need to appeal to a broader range of Russians who ascribe to all sorts of politics. To that end, we should seek to incorporate the right wing into the Ordosocialist apparatus of the party. Accepting these people into the fold can only serve to strengthen us in our interests going forward."
 NIK_natsoc_together_to_greatness_desc:0 "In order to mend the rift that has grown between the leftist Ordosocialists and the right wing Ordosocialists, we should approach some right wing leaders with offers of positions in government. These positions won't be glamorous or particularly powerful, but it would go a long way towards normalizing and improving relations with them. This may slightly weaken Serov's power within the party, but by opening up our candidate selection pool for jobs in the government to people further to the right, we will also be expanding our talent pool, increasing the government's ability to find skilled candidates for jobs."
 NIK_natsoc_the_proletarian_nation_desc:0 "At the heart of Ordosocialism lies the Russian worker. The proletariat is and will always be the most important aspect of Ordosocialism, and of Russia as a whole. After all, Russia is the birthplace of the revolution, of socialism as a viable ideology. We must cling to this identity, even in the face of the oppressive German and Japanese Empires. The conspiracy of international capital against Russia will be avenged, but only through faith in Russia and the party can this be achieved."
 NIK_natsoc_moral_code_of_the_builder_of_ordosocialism_desc:0 "1. Loyalty to Ordosocialism, and love of the Russian Motherland.\n2. Conscious work for the good of the society: One who doesn't work, doesn't get to eat.\n3. Care for the collective property, as well as the multiplying of this property.\n4. High consciousness of the social responsibilities, and intolerance to the violation of the social interests.\n5. Collectivism and comradery: one for all, and all for the party.\n6. Humane relationships between party members: One party member is a friend, a comrade and a brother to any other follower of Ordosocialism.\n7. Honesty, ethical cleanliness, as well as simplicity and modesty both in private and public life.\n8. Mutual respect in the family, and care for the upbringing of the children.\n9. Intolerance to injustice, social parasitism, unfairness, careerism, and acquisitiveness against our own peoples.\n10. Loyalty between all the nations of the USSR to Russia\n11. Intolerance to the enemies of Russia.\n12. Brotherly solidarity to all Russians within our nation."
 NIK_natsoc_the_reawoken_consciousness_desc:0 "The new Soviet man can be described as a lot of things. He is intelligent and educated, well versed in traditional marxist-leninist literature as well as more modern Ordosocialist literature. He is watchful and vigilant, reporting to the proper authorities any misdeeds or crimes he sees. He is patriotic and nationalistic, secure in the knowledge that Russia and the Soviet Union stand higher than any other nations on this Earth. Above all else though, he is loyal, obeying the state and having full faith in Serov's wisdom and guidance. This is the new Soviet man, and you will become him, if not for patriotism, then for your life."
 NIK_natsoc_national_economy_policy_desc:0 "The former economic policy of the Soviet Union wasn't necessarily bad, it simply wasn't properly suited for military industry production, and it didn't prioritize development of the most important region of the Soviet Union, Russia, as much as it should have. We will rectify this mistake when designing our new economic policy for Russia. This time, all developmental resources will be directed towards the core Russian territory, and this development will focus on military production and construction."
 NIK_natsoc_the_tactical_prudence_desc:0 "While state ownership of military and heavy industry is both necessary and desirable for both the party and Russia, it may be beneficial for us to allow some private ownership of small businesses and land. It may be distasteful for some in the party to have to relinquish such control, but allowing the people free right to entrepreneurship and private property will help restart the economy and encourage growth. Additionally, if fears of radical ideas infecting the populace in the concern, then they should have no fear. Such entrepreneurs and small business owners will be watched very carefully."
 NIK_natsoc_the_commissars_of_industry_desc:0 "This idea of workplace democracy is both ridiculous and inefficient. While this notion of workplace democracy may satisfy the worker, it's simply terrible for maximizing productivity from a factory. Our factories will not be run in such a manner. Factories will be run just as our government is, cleanly organized and centralized with a strict hierarchy and chain of command. At the top of this chain is the industrial Commissar. He commands the factory and gives the men day to day instructions and orders. He is the lynchpin of the whole operation, and we must find men who are suitable to take these positions across the country."
 NIK_natsoc_the_national_accountability_desc:0 "The capitalist system is vile, but if nothing else, it provides great motivation for individuals to succeed. Failure in business or the economy can lead to factories closing or a man losing his job. That sort of fear of failure is excellent for motivation, and we should seek to simulate that concept cost accounting for our planned economy. Factories that don't produce as much as they should or can will be warned once. Continual failure to meet quotas will result in less and less funding, until closure if necessary. Successful factories that meet or even exceed quotas will be rewarded with more resources for them to use and expand with. These factories will be accountable for their own survival."
 NIK_natsoc_one_big_cooperative_desc:0 "Russia is a large and diverse nation, a fact only accentuated by this period of warlordism. It similarly has a large and diverse economy, with many different players and economic philosophies. Market liberalism, state capitalism, marxists planned economics, laissez faire economics, we have it all. However, this diversity of thought is a weakness. Our economic structure is the only correct one, and it would help others to understand this. To that end, we have created an economic union in which all the major economic players of our nation will work with one another. Together, they will pursue the common goals of class consciousness within our nation and work towards an economically productive tomorrow."
 NIK_natsoc_the_refined_gosplan_desc:0 "The Gosplan was the original central planning committee of the Soviet Union. It was the main driver and planning system behind the Soviet economy, existing from 1921 until it's dissolution in '45. The guiding principle behind the Gosplan was the idea of the planned economy, an avenue through which the state could control the economy and ensure prosperity and safety. We will create a new Gosplan, whose focus will be on building our military industrial complex into one of the most formidable on Earth, with productive capabilities to match. Soon, even Germany will be eclipsed by our economic might."
 NIK_natsoc_the_ordosocialist_household_desc:0 "What did the old Tsarist regime fall so many years ago? A strange question, but one worth asking. It wasn't the brutal treatment of serfs, or Tsar Nicholas' poor leadership, or even the war. In the end, it came down to bread. The people were starving, and when people are wracked with hunger at the brink of death, they will do whatever they think they have to do to fix their situation. Oftentimes, this turns into rage against the government. Agriculture must be a priority in order to avoid such a fate for our government. Farms will be collectivized under state leadership to maximise output, and the people housed in state controlled homes. The Ordosocialist household will be one of plenty."
 NIK_natsoc_the_transformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Our population is growing, and some within our government predict that we will experience a population boom now that Russia is finally stabilizing again. Soon, our nutritional needs may well surpass our capacity for production. A number of daring plans and ideas for boosting agricultural yields have been put forward in order to address the problem before it ever becomes a real issue. These plans range from clearcutting forests for more agricultural land to a plan that would divert water from rivers feeding into the Aral sea to irrigate new farmlands."
 NIK_natsoc_mending_the_industry_desc:0 "Russia's industry lies broken after so many years of bombing and internal wars. However, among the rubble lies an opportunity to create a Russia stronger than ever before. Bukharin was a fool and traitor for many reasons, but the most important was in how he handled our industry. His lack of focus on heavy industry meant that when the time came to fight, we had no factories to forge the implements with which to defend ourselves. We will not repeat his mistakes. Reconstruction and economic reorganization are already underway, and this time we will make sure that heavy industry is front and center at the core of our new economy."
 NIK_natsoc_forging_the_shield_and_sword_desc:0 "As a great man once said, "The only real power comes out the end of a long rifle". Unfortunately, Russia has a severe lack of rifles. In fact, Russia has a severe lack of almost every weapon. Tanks, planes, rifles, and artillery are all in short supply. A similar situation exists with our airfields, naval bases, and defensive fortifications. Simply put, Russia is rather weak right now, and even a relatively small invasion force from Germany could topple us. We must rectify this situation. Resources must be put towards building up our military industry to fend off would be invaders and secure our borders."
 NIK_natsoc_the_revolutionary_adventurism_desc:0 "The future of the Russian economy lies in the state. Moderate and social democrats warn against the sort of revolutionary political adventurism that we are pushing. They lack the will to fully reject the corporatist and capitalist systems of Italy and the United States. We have no such restrictions. We must continue and expand the process of nationalization in all industries. Under the government's control, we will bring Russia closer to the sort of autarkic self-sufficiency that other nations Germany have strived towards."
 NIK_natsoc_collective_vanguardism_desc:0 "The people of Russia must understand that through our collective will, Russia can achieve anything. There is no greater expression of this collective will than the workers collective. The people, working together in thousands of collectives across Russia to form an even greater expression of the people, the state. We must spread this message to the masses. They must understand that they are the engine, the driving force, the power that has brought Russia as far as it has. So long as they believe that they are what's driving our state forward, they won't feel any need to actually seize control."
 NIK_natsoc_attack_at_the_capital_desc:0 "There can be no private property, businesses, or financial institutions in the new Russia to come. The global conspiracy of capitalist and corporatist nations plotting against us is how we fell last time. Bukharin was far too liberal with the NEP, and we cannot afford to repeat the old fool's mistakes. Private property and institutions will be seized and nationalized at once. Those who volunteer their property quickly and cooperatively will be given rewards, like government positions or a large one time payment. Those who refuse will face execution."
 NIK_natsoc_a_leap_to_the_future_desc:0 "The introduction of socialism into Russia's economy must be accelerated if we are to protect ourselves from the capitalist and corporatist nations that threaten us on all sides. The idea that we need a grace period as we transition into a planned economic setup is not only foolish, but dangerous. The longer our economy remains open to the world, the more opportunities our enemies will have to exploit our weakness. We have the means and the will to implement socialism into the economy now, and we must if we wish to protect Russia from outside forces."
 NIK_natsoc_total_mobilization_desc:0 "Total mobilization is an interesting concept. It refers to the complete and total utilization of all resources a state is capable of mobilizing. To engage in the total mobilization of a nation is to convert said nation into an engine of war, consuming men and steel and machinery alike and pumping out soldiers and rifles and tanks and planes. Many nations view total mobilization as a last resort, something to be utilized only when all else has failed. In Ordosocialism, total mobilization is an ideal, a goal to strive towards. Only through the total mobilization of all Russia has to offer can we crush the capitalist and cosmopolitan forces of the world."
 NIK_natsoc_the_red_army_reborn_desc:0 "The Red Army that once swept across Russia was one that marched with purpose and motivation. That Red Army marched to spread socialism across Russia. It is important that it is understood that the Red Army never stopped marching. That Red Army is our own today, as our army is nothing more than a continuation of the Red Army that came before it. We share the same principles, the same doctrines, and most importantly, we share a similar ideology, one that we're certain the original Red Army would have marched to had they been aware of the Ordosocialism at the time."
 NIK_natsoc_encourage_new_officers_desc:0 "While the old guard have plenty of experience and knowledge from so many wars in years past, they really aren't the kind of people we want manning our army. Many of them have sworn allegiances a dozen times over to whoever they find themselves working for at the time. Whether it be fascists, traditional communist, capitalists, it matter not to them. All that matters is their safety and comfort, and if it takes a petty allegiance, then they will gladly proclaim allegiance all day and night.\n\nThere are surely hundreds, if not thousands of young, fresh soldiers with knowledge and experience from the Unification Wars as well as the devotion and loyalty towards Ordosocialism needed to be an officer. We should begin promoting these kinds of men to officer positions."
 NIK_natsoc_reinstate_the_commissars_desc:0 "Political commissars are meant to be among the most loyal and devoted men in our military. Their job is to ensure that the soldiers in our military remain as loyal to Ordosocialism as possible. Due to our former relationship with the right, it wasn't possible to have political commissars of any particular strength or effectiveness. Now, however, with Ordosocialists firmly in control of the government, we can have real political commissars, with loyalty and drive. They will be the vanguard, fighting on the front lines with our men and making sure that treason and disloyalty towards Ordosocialism remains nothing more than a fear, and not a threat."
 NIK_natsoc_an_eye_to_our_history_desc:0 "The Unification Wars were a gruelling and savage affair, but they served well to hone our military, much like a hunter hones a knife. In the aftermath of such a bloody conflict, we've learned quite a lot, and will be modifying our doctrines based on lessons we learned. We gained experience fighting in the varying terrains of Russia, we learned better how to manage our supply lines, and most importantly, our men got real combat to train with, and we can use their experiences to continue bettering our military. All forces train to win the last war that they fought."
 NIK_natsoc_the_legacy_of_the_great_patriotic_war_desc:0 "It was always Zhukov and Voroloshilov who had the right of it when it came to military affairs. Their ideas about using mass industrialized combat combined with more traditional Russian Army tactics were revolutionary, and had they implemented those ideas earlier in the war against Germany, we very well may have pushed the Hun back, and even won. We should endeavor to implement their ideas about warfare into our doctrines in an effort to modernise our military. Zhukov and Voroloshilov were great generals, let us not waste their insights."
 NIK_natsoc_the_bleeding_tomorrow_desc:0 "All forces train to win the last war that they fought, but it's the armies that prepare for the wars of the future that find victory. Technology is advancing at a rate unprecedented in history. It wasn't twenty years ago that the helicopters and intercontinental ballistic missiles we have today seemed like nothing more than science fiction, or twenty years before that when a bomb that could destroy an entire city was but a fantasy. The moral here is that better technology is always being created, and if we don't stay up to date and informed, we're going to learn about these new technologies the hard way. We must prepare for the battlefield of tomorrow. Either we're going to be at the bleeding edge of technology, or we're going to be impaled on it."
 NIK_natsoc_lessons_from_the_red_napoleon_desc:0 "Tuchachevsky was a genius on the battlefield if there ever was one. He was a giant on the battlefield, easily among the greatest generals of the Second World War and West Russian War. His doctrine regarding discipline and battle tactics was revolutionary in an era that has all but abandoned the excellence in the field. Technology is obviously important, but it's the general, the commander, and the captain with whom the focus should lie. If we can train our men to think on their feet and come up with creative solutions to dangerous situations, then we will have succeeded. The German relies on his guns, his tanks, and his missiles to do all the work, but he never thinks. None of those things will do him any good if he doesn't realize he's already been flanked."
 NIK_natsoc_developments_on_the_kalashnikov_desc:0 "The AK-47 is one of the finest rifles to come out of Russia possibly ever. It's cheap to produce, extremely reliable, has replaceable parts, and is simple to understand and use. As it stands, the rifle is unparalleled. This needs to change. While the design is superior in every capacity compared to older rifle models, this is rather unremarkable in the history of rifle developments. The next generation of guns will always be superior to the last, and the Ak-47's excellent design today may become obsolete tomorrow. We mustn't be content to rest on our laurels while rifle technology in other nations surges ahead."
 NIK_natsoc_applied_mbt_designs_desc:0 "Designing a tank suited for our particular needs is no simple task. Not only must it be reliable enough to trudge through the muddy swamps of Western Russia during Raputitsa, but it also must be fuel efficient enough to operate for enough hours or even a few days without refuelling. Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard. Our tank technology is now decades behind that of Germany, so developing such a tank will take time. Applying what lessons we learned from the Unification Wars would serve as a starting point at the very least."
 NIK_natsoc_away_from_the_ground_desc:0 "Despite what our generals say, the Army isn't the only branch involved in warfare, and it should not be focused on exclusively. Both our Navy and Air Force are in dire need of attention. Our Air Force is but a shell of the organization it once was decades ago, and that's to say nothing of our Navy, which, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. It will take several years to bring either into any sort of military capable shape, and several more to match those of Germany or Japan. It will be expensive and time consuming, but rebuilding these branches of the military will be vital to our future success."
 NIK_natsoc_follow_golovkos_footsteps_desc:0 "Arseniy Golovko was a Soviet admiral who served in the Soviet Navy, specifically as Commander of the Red Banner Northern Fleet during the Second World War. His fleet, while small, served an important role protecting our northern waters in the White Sea. The Nazi's were never able to push with any success in the White Seas as a result of his excellent command, and his fleet even aided in a few offensives. Ultimately, we should hope to imitate his rather successful fleet. Forming a small, efficient commerce protection/raiding Northern Fleet would do us wonders in protecting northern trade during peacetime, and would protect ports and naval supply lines during wartime."
 NIK_natsoc_intelligence_on_the_field_desc:0 "Field intelligence in the military is arguably more important today than it ever has been in the past. Knowing where your enemy is and whether or not your enemy knows where you are could mean the difference between throwing a few artillery shells at the enemy and receiving a few instead. This distinction is made all the more important by the massive technological gap between us and our enemies. While we might be throwing shells at the enemy, they may see fit to launch missiles at us. Our reconnaissance ability will be vital in the wars to come, and it's important that we recognize this fact."
 NIK_natsoc_wings_over_the_motherland_desc:0 "The destruction the Luftwaffe has dealt Russia is unimaginable, by all accounts. A sustained, decade long bombing campaign indiscriminately destroying everything over a couple stories tall. The bombing campaign permanently scarred our people, and there isn't a Russian alve without a story to tell from those years. Such a thing can never be allowed to happen again. Our Air Force must become powerful enough to deter even the thought of engaging Russia in the air. Never again will our people see Luftwaffe planes over Russia skies."
 NIK_natsoc_a_new_sun_in_the_east_desc:0 "The spirit of revolution has been all but crushed worldwide. The oppressive German and Japanese regimes seek to smother anything even resembling a possible revolt or revolution. We must act as a counterbalance to their smothering effect. We will act as the sun to a seed, nourishing the revolutionary spirit and providing sustenance so that it one day might grow into a full blown revolution. A revolution to encompass the whole world, so that one day all oppressed peoples may be freed. Such a dream is a ways off, but all it takes to start is a seed and some sunlight."
 NIK_natsoc_clandestine_services_desc:0 "Russia needs a clandestine transportation and support network. Specifically, Russia needs the ability to move goods covertly.

This liquid border made it exceptionally easy to move agents and other supplies across the border, something we've taken advantage of with some frequency.\n\nUnfortunately, since the unification of West Russia, Germany has made increasingly large scale attempts to pin down where the border is and lock it down, even contacting us for assistance. Given that it's in our best interest to continue Germany's border woes, we've made an effort to be as confusing as possible on the subject. We've had our diplomats tell Germany different information on where we believe the border to be. We've provided false information on geographical landmarks and other such locations on the border. Most impressively, we even uprooted and moved an entire border checkpoint on two occasions in order to confuse German cartographers sent to map the border. The liquid border will remain ensured."

However, that isn't to say it was nonexistent.\n\nRecords from before the collapse indicate that such a nuclear program not too dissimilar to our own had been underway as early as 1942 before ceasing in 1945 with the collapse. We have lists of the names of several of the scientists that worked on the program back then, as well as several other lists of candidates who were considered for the program.\n\nAdditionally, we were able to find faculty lists from several former universities in Russia with atomic research departments with the names of scientists we can use for our nuclear weapons program.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no idea where most of these scientists are today. After the invasion and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, many of them found themselves across Russia as they fled the west.

Of course, that cannot be blamed on the Germans; had the people of Russia shown more faith in God and dedicated themselves to the Regent earlier, perhaps He would have seen fit to spare them from suffering!\n\nAs always, the Blessed Regent has a more nuanced understanding of the matter. The bombings may have been intended to bring the Russians back to God, but for those already enlightened, they were intended to inspire.

When their faith began to waver with the arrival of degenerate modernity, they foolishly abandoned it, refusing to harden their hearts even in the face of the blackest sin.

Bolsheviks and liberals think them 'indispensable' to Russia, and they constantly seek to ingratiate themselves - offering a hand open in friendship with the other concealing a knife behind their back. They have propagated amongst the pure race for so long that they often seem indistinguishable from us.

Is this, too, the doing of Lucifer? What other explanation could there be? The Regent is incapable of error! Whatever the reason, we must meet this challenge with sword in hand!

The first step in this process is to ensure the loyalty of our holy men, so that there is no need for another great purge.

The serpentine spirit of Satan lurks in their hearts. There is only one possible cure for such wickedness.\n\nTo fill the void left by our righteous cleansing, we shall have to elevate new, pure-hearted men in the bishops' stead. With the Church so thoroughly corrupted, we cannot trust any man of the cloth, no matter how lowly.

The time of the Unifier is again at hand, and its harbinger is Igor Shafarevich.\n\nShafarevich will build his nation neither on the false pietisms of the Fascists nor the moral degradation of the Leftists - Russia will be shaped by what has always made it great, the purity of its soil and the refined disposition of its people. Only a Moral Russia can be a strong Russia, and only a strong Russia can be great.

This, then, is our goal: to find the strongest and best flowers in our garden, nurture them into brilliant life, and set them loose to transform the world around them.\n\nWe will overhaul our recruitment structure in both Party and Government, setting the absolute highest standards of education and training, and when we are done our nation will be led by the cream of the Russian crop.

It falls to us to ensure that they are curbed in the worst of their excesses, so that we will have a firm and unquestioned hand in guiding this country to the common good.\n\nWe will, through quiet words and unquiet actions, move our Opposition into positions of ceremonial power and no real value, while we place pressure upon their leadership to follow the will of the Russian state (its voice being, of course, Shafarevich).

Those days are long gone now, and the Empire is a fading memory, but the problem the Tsars faced has been handed over to us. What approach shall we take to preserve our national essence, while remaining faithful stewards of the people God has granted us dominion over?\n\nShafarevich believes he has the solution: an approach he calls Self-Sufficiency, wherein the non-Russian national communities shall see neither incorporation nor exploitation. Instead the Russian nation shall focus on enriching its people, and the minorities within it can go their own way - they will be blessedly, truly free of the hands of the State, now and forever."
 NIK_shafarevich_bond_the_countryside_desc:0 "We must never forget the rural roots of Russian life, and to abandon them to the ravages of industrial monstrosity would be utterly immoral of us. Instead we will focus on the true aims of any government worth its salt - allowing the fertile soil of Russian peasantry to take root and blossom into fecundity.\n\nOf course, that does not mean the state is entirely irrelevant: far from it, our new Russian Agrarianism policies will ensure that the state will forever be joined at the hip to the farmer! From investment in rural production methods to the sending of agricultural advisors, from bureaus to tractors to roads, the Russian State will experience rebirth where it was born at the first."
 NIK_shafarevich_farewell_to_arcadia_desc:0 "We do not make this decision lightly - it is with the bitterest of regrets - but for the Rodina to rebuild some compromises must be made, no matter the cost. Just as trees survive better with the cutting of branches when the forest fires come, so too shall Russia's industrial abominations, expansive though they might be, save us from the inferno of war.\n\nWe will invest in industrial and heavy-mining concerns in areas that are sparsely populated, boosting our private industry at the cost of some of our cultural purity. It might be a betrayal of our values. It might even be considered oppressive. With our diplomatic threats coming closer every day, however, this investment will come in handy sooner or later. We would prefer to wield it of our own volition, rather than have it foisted upon us."
 NIK_shafarevich_russias_beating_heart_desc:0 "As the firms, the farmers and the factories of the Motherland grow into each other, the Nation comes closer to the platonic ideal of a united series of tissues. Yes, Russia is one giant organ of life and common purpose, and what a glorious shared purpose it is! We must not rest easy, however: the people must always be guarded from their worst impulses, not to mention those germs who would wish to defile what we have built here and turn it to their own ends.\n\nContinual incremental adjustments to this system, developing new methods to manage Russian ruralities and building a strong culture of self-reliance amongst our peasantry will ensure that this self-sustaining system continues to grow and self-correct. May all of Russia embrace this organic life, and may it sustain a vital Nation far into the future!"
 NIK_shafarevich_promote_russian_traditions_desc:0 "In the lands under our hegemony, many mansions claim dominion over the Russian heart. Some of them are of Socialist origin, some of Monarchist roots, and some stem from foreign influences. There will be more in the days to come, but if we are to expel these wayward ideas we must build something of substance in its place. The Russian Glory must be on full display for its light to enlighten our people! Nothing less is acceptable!\n\nWe will focus on the development of the rituals that tie us to the soil, and to the Nation: national holidays are only the beginning of a full-scale revamp of our civic culture. Religious occasions, national commemorations of martyrs and the enforcement of Russian language and history will ensure that the light of the Rus shines far brighter than the darkness which would put it out!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_counter_russophobic_campaign_desc:0 "In recent days some have spoken of those with a sinister vision for Russia - they speak of the demon of "multiculturalism", where tolerance of those different from us is is interchangeable from the blending of pure Russian culture with incompatible, alien substances! It is utter nonsense to believe such things, of course, but the nonsense is potent nonetheless. If we are to combat this stupidity we must start from the ground of Russian society - the peasantry.\n\nIn truth, many Russian ruralities have an unrealised, nebulous notion of what it means to be Russian. By affirming their God-given sense of what is Russian and what is from the Devil, we will reinforce the notion that a half-hearted embrace of minority culture, of the loss of the heritage of earth and blood, is Russophobia in its most demonic form. And when we set these people loose upon the cities, we hope the ivory-tower elites who speak above their station will learn that lesson, too."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_politically_conscious_army_desc:0 "Glory is in the Russian blood - our people were made for greatness, and the Army is the distillation of the finest traditions of our people. Honor! Courage! Integrity! Patriotism! These values thrive everywhere, but they blossom into view only in the men who have selflessly volunteered for the greatest of all possible lives. What better way to ensure the spirit of our National Revival never dies out than to build it into the Army?\n\nRegular political re-education lessons, the stacking of leadership positions with firm loyalists dedicated to the Passionaryy ideals, and an emphasis on rural strength will keep the Army forever loyal to our ideals and our vision for the nation. Quiet amendments to the Constitution will also ensure that should our leadership ever come into question, the soldiers know exactly where their interests lie."
 NIK_shafarevich_from_sea_to_shining_sea_desc:0 "This, then, is the dream: nothing more, nothing less than the bringing to wholeness of Holy Russia. Even as the Union fell, even as the barbarities consumed so much of Russian life and culture, we held on to this dream. The time has come when we shall bring it into being - so with our Army ready to roll the false-kulturny ideas that pollute Russia all the way back to Germania, let us be fearless!\n\nThere is a home for us, a place where the people most precious of God shall ever rest: that place is the heart of the Father in heaven, and the Holy Mother Rus on earth!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_russian_idea_desc:0 "Again and again, civilization has risen, again and again it has collapsed, and again and again, Russia has taken its remnants into our loving arms. When Orthodoxy burned with Constantinople, we took the mantle of the new Rome without question. When the liberalists burnt Europe half to the ground, we in Russia took the mantle of tradition. Now that the Germanic savages hold Russian soil and people hostage, we shall again assume the mantle of those who know they are the last redoubt - for that is what we are.\n\nBut let us never cower before the enemy! Our long march to the Baltics, to the Urals, has brought with it the Russian Idea - the vitality and the beauty and the wild strength of Russian life - everywhere our boots have landed. Again I tell you: as long as we hold the Rodina within our hearts, in our minds and with every harvest, Russia can never fall! We are unconquered, unconquerable, and in the long war with savagery, there has been one certain truth:\n\n§RWe have won every single time. We will win this time, too.§!"

"표트르," 타보리츠키는 다가가면서 채워진 보드카 잔을 들고 말했습니다. 그의 우아하고 침착한 동작은 표트르에게 그의 안에 있는 당장에라도 폭발할 것 같은 광기를 잠시동안 잊게 했습니다. "같이 한잔하지 않겠나?"\n\n뻔히 보이는 계략이었습니다. 표트르는 타보리츠키와 눈을 마주치지 않았습니다. 그는 대답할 겨를도 없이 고개를 저었습니다.\n\n타보리츠키의 미소는 사라지고, 표트르가 악몽 속에서 보았던 무표정한 죽은 눈동자의 시선으로 대체되었습니다. 그들이 나보코프에게 파견될 때 그의 용모를 돋보이게 했던 것과 같은 표정이었습니다. 그가 처음 화학무기를 풀라고 명령했을 때와 같은 모습이었습니다. 하지만, 어쩌면... "폐하," 표트르는 약간 긴장을 풀며 시작했습니다. "제가.."\n\n모든 일이 한꺼번에 일어났습니다. 표트르는 광택이 나는 마룻바닥에 유리잔이 떨어져 산산조각이 나는 것을 보고 본능적으로 뒤쪽으로 홱 돌아섰습니다. 타보리츠키는 오른손에 광택이 나는 강철을 쥐고 앞으로 도약하는 것 같았습니다. 표트르는 반사적으로 경종을 울리며 재킷 주머니 안에서 권총을 꺼내려고 했습니다. 다만 권총은 덜커덩 소리를 내며 바닥에 떨어질 뿐이었습니다. 그가 할 수 있는 일은 그의 칼을 쥔 팔목을 잡고 타보리츠키를 향해 팔을 바깥쪽으로 던지는 것 밖에 없었습니다.\n\n두 사람 모두 늙어 삐걱거리는 러시아의 과거의 유물이지만 표트르쪽이 더 약했습니다. 1초도 지나지 않아, 그는 팔꿈치에 뭔가가 떨어지는 것을 느꼈고, 칼은 더 가까이 다가왔습니다. 그 순간, 그의 작은 용기가 증발해버려 그저 횡설수설하는 것으로 대체되었고, 그는 삶에 대한 공포를 느꼈습니다. "세르게이, 세르게이, 세르게이!" 목이 터져라 소리를 질렀습니다. "세르게이, 그만! 멈춰! 세르게이, 제발! 잠깐 내... 내말 좀 들어봐, 세르게이!"\n\n그의 간청에도 불구하고 친구의 눈에는 자비의 기미가 보이지 않았습니다. 광채가 나는 지점은 미친 사람의 힘에 자극되어 더 가까이 다가왔습니다. 표트르는 이를 악물고 눈을 부릅뜨고 그의 오래된 뼈에서 마지막 힘을 짜내려 애쓰다가, 미끄러졌습니다. 표트르의 갈비뼈 사이로 차가운 무언가가 미끄러지듯이 움직였습니다. 그는 먼저 벽에 부딪혔다가 바닥으로 쓰러졌습니다. 시야가 좁아지면서 그가 마지막으로 본 것은 그의 오랜 친구의 떨리는 부츠를 향해 조금씩 조금씩 퍼지는 그의 피의 웅덩이 였습니다."

The darkened ceiling swarmed with the tell-tale lines of the skein - lines of indescribable color that lanced through his view of the snuffed-out chandelier. They danced for him, up there, but he knew that if he stood up, he could not reach them - they were too far away. Too distant.\n\nThrough watching them, he had tracked the progress of his ascension. The trek of the Tsarevich, the rightful heir, from Yekaterinburg. They stood fast, however. Where had he gone? They would not have disappeared if he died - for the skein tracks the immortal soul, not the fallible body. To the Regent, that was the mystery of it all. In the lines, he could watch them. He could know who was plotting against him, who was secretly calling him a madman. On those threads, he saw himself binding them, giving the attention of the Okhrana, until they told him all of what they had done. What they could do. Who they were. No matter how careful the lie, or how much the liar begging that he was innocent, he saw the patterns. The weave of Heaven.\n\nHe blinked, and, for a moment, he saw a flash of inspiration. Something new, moving in the skein. A new line. He twisted it around in his mind, and let the gaps be filled. It was something new, interlocking around the strings. Pulling them in. Coalescing from dust, like his Russia had. A miracle. A loom with which to weave the future. The strings needed an engine to drive them.\n\nThe Regent opened his eyes, gazing around the room. The journal sat on his nightstand, enticing his attention. He knew which way the clock would turn. But - did his treasury? Did the people? The Court?\n\nHe picked it up, along with his pen. He would tell them to adjust their habits at once. The letter would be sent in the morning. They had to know."

No man of the cloth would ever understand.\n\nHe knew that they still thought themselves above him. The arrogance of priests was boundless and their propensity for betrayal well-known. After all, it had been a priest who led the treacherous workers to their deaths in 1905. Even then, the Judeo-Bolshevik puppeteers had been working to destroy the Empire.\n\nHe shivered at the thought. He had to remain loyal to his faith, but what of the Orthodox Church? They were still just men, and didn't understand God like he did. For them, religion was all rules and ritual. Taboritsky knew that faith had to be followed with action; no amount of prayer would ever save Russia. God would surely favor him, but only if he first proved himself worthy by great deeds.\n\nTaboritsky rose, and steeled his mind as the whispers of angels drifted to his ears again.

The skein rushed before his eyes, travelling in every direction at once. Blinding light sliced into his soul, setting it aflame with heavenly fire. He slumped backwards, staring up at the ceiling where the skein danced, utterly transfixed. Within its folds and creases, he saw such knowledge as had been forgotten aeons prior. His eyes rolled back into his head, unable to bear the torrent of wisdom that poured into his mind, and he blacked out.\n\nWhen Taboritsky came to, he was lying on his back, drenched in sweat. As he opened his eyes, he saw that the world was bathed in a beautiful, yet eerie magenta light. It seemed to permeate all around him; when he stood and looked down at his hands, he saw that his skin was black, and his veins had turned to gold. He blinked in shock - and suddenly, everything had returned to normal. His mind ran over with lost knowledge, dizzying him.

And what did it mean to give these Proletarians, if that was indeed their true name, the means of production? Would the committees be run by the elite, who after all were used to power, or to unsteady newbies whose enthusiasm far outstripped their experience?\n\nNot to mention the matter of who the Enemy was, of course. Oh, everyone knew there was an Enemy: the propaganda rang true, and the paranoia was fresh and bright as the smell of blood in the winter snow. They lurked behind every doorway, their subtle strings tugging at the Russian heart, angling innocents into complacency, parasitism. Sin.\n\nThe question remained, unanswered and unanswerable, a dagger at the heart of Serov's movement. Who was the Enemy? And if they were a class in a classless society, both of which the Marxists were adamant about, how could one ever tell an Enemy from a friend?\n\nIn the end it simply wasn't worth the trouble, fighting over a deafening void and a slowly collapsing loyalty to a silent leader. The Passionaryy elements seemed to fall away all at once from the base Serov used to pummel legislation through the Assembly, as if some invisible chain had been lifted, and it was clear that something fundamental had changed in the Republic.\n\nLike most divorces, it was quiet at the end.

It was all catnip for Lavov, who'd hated the sight of guns since his father perished in the fall of the Union. The errant rabble who called themselves the Left hadn't been any more convincing than the drooling reactionaries they opposed on this point: all and sundry seemed determined to march into the sunset, toting a gun on one hand and their enemies' skulls on the other.\n\nOnly General Secretary Serov had promised true peace, true unity. And Lavov knew, with all the quiet absolution of a true believer, that Serov would deliver.\n\nAnd he had, hadn't he?

But some things were unavoidable, and important enough for the Party to address - so a working holiday was declared and the various Congresses and the Workers' Councils convened.\n\nSerov gazed at them. Talent, certainly, but unpolished. Blunt and dull, like steel that had been left in dank air too long - edgeless. It would take work to weave them all into a knife worth wielding, and if he wanted to succeed, he would have to start now.\n\nHe asked the simple question, left it hanging in the air like a noose, an invitation.

Their subordinates?"\n\nInto the deafening void that followed it, he began to drill the principle of mutual knowledge - over and over, just like he'd been taught by the Academy - into their heads. Simple, repetitive motion. It was almost like the conditioning techniques his commanders had speculated about using. This time, however, there would be no time for trial runs.\n\nSerov began his next move. Raising a piece of paper, he began to read names: the loud, the outspoken, the complainers and the whiners and the fearful. They were, he said, welcome to leave - but should they stay, they would be honed into something better. Something greater. Demotions, of course, would follow, even revolutionary criticism.

The old Soviet Union had been too weak, too divided. The old Soviet Union sacrificed so much, for so little gain. Serov and his government would remedy these mistakes, and the new Soviet Union would emerge from the ashes stronger than ever before.\n\nOne of the greatest weaknesses of the old Soviet Union was its federalized structure. The bureaucracy became bloated, and local governments were given far too much autonomy. One only has to look at what Kaganovich did with Western Siberia to see why that was a mistake. Serov's new Soviet Union would be unitary in structure. Local governments would be a mere stepping stone between the people and the capital, and all major decisions would go through the central administration first. The unitary structure proved its efficacy in World War II, with the strong, united Japanese and Germans defeating the fractured Americans. The same unitary structure would be applied to any formerly autonomous administrations, as giving the minorities their own identity merely weakened the Union's cohesion.\n\nThe Soviet Union was a Russian invention, and yet Bukharin sacrificed so much to try and please the other peoples within its borders. The Ukrainians, Belarusians, the Baltics, and the Turks, they did not answer directly to the capital, and therefore did not identify truly with Moscow. In the end, their loyalty failed us when it mattered most, and proves that they can't be trusted with the same freedoms Bukharin afforded them.

It was a game, Serov thought, a high-stakes game for the future itself. And the time had come to pick his allies.\n\nThe old cults of Taboritsky, Shafarevich and Gumilyov lurked in his base still. He knew, staring at those politely clapping for the latest speaker, that they could never be trusted with the will of the people - they barely trusted him at the best of times. He was always dancing on eggshells, hiding his real beliefs under a constantly shifting series of dogwhistles and promises of "right unity". Where had that gotten him?

Hadn't it been enough that he'd enthusiastically dogwhistled to their basest, most irritatingly capitalist desires to gain a seat at the table?

Moving to the 'Internal Enemies' section, however...that was promising in a way mere centralism had never been.\n\nYes, if there was one thing Serov knew best in his long years of serving the Republican Left, it was the rooting out of enemies - and the many ways one developed of finding them.

Yegor glances to and fro, beads of sweat rolling off his face.\n\nThis was... this was... a Breton! It was some sort of deal about the black market and the trafficking of agents worldwide. The details had long been lost to Yegor's mind. After eternity, or perhaps a few seconds, the figure stood tall, reaching out his... hand, maybe? Yegor pulsed his muscles. Through great effort, similar to the launch of a rocket, Yegor built up pressure and flung his hand towards the shape. Soon after, the figure was gone."

At every thought of the needle penetrating his skin, a hook sank into his flesh and pulled him down, further and further, into a pit of impotent fury. This man's death would mean nothing. Yegor's trigger finger itched, but he restrained himself. This worthless shell of a man still had some information, after all.\n\n"Why are the dens running out of supplies, why are the Bretons backing out of their deals? Speak up, little man, before the floor is painted. I need a supplier, or else you're dead. You hear me? Fucking dead!"\n\nThe man, a random backroom clerk who got mixed up into the black market through no fault of his own, sobbed as the barrel of the pistol touched against his cranium. He began to hyperventilate, and snot ran down his chin like a schoolboy who scraped his knee. "Look... sir. I t-told you. The Bretons are shutting down black market activities. They're c-cleaning their hands of it."\n\nA shot rang out. The clerk slouched over, stuck in a kneeling position, as blood streamed from his forehead onto the concrete floor. Yegor heaved of feeble indignation. In a burst of anger, he kicked the clerk's corpse and punched at the walls which surrounded him, only to be left bent over with broken knuckles and lost hope.

Soldiers of Serov and agents of Ordosocialism wandered in, dripping in blood, gunshots behind them, and the bankers accepted us because those exploitative fiends will take any chance they can to squeeze a profit from suffering. We used many methods, from interjecting ourselves into loans and transactions, to offering our dissidents and traitors up as cheap labor for markets abroad. By becoming ever more involved in Swiss financial institutions, we have secured a place for us in the international marketplace, be it small.\n\nAs our nation expands, our ideology takes root in the populace and our economic bubble grows larger, we necessitate connections in Europe.

Anarchists, sewers of chaos. The second corpse belongs to nationalists, who do not recognize the supremacy of socialism. Reactionaries, and tyrants. The third corpse is for those who follow in the footsteps of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, but do not love Russia, or its people. Revisionists, and corruptors of socialism. The fourth corpse is those most tragic of deaths. Followers of socialist thought and nationalists, who have, nevertheless, rebelled against our righteous authority. They are contrarians, who seek to destroy instead of reform. The fifth corpse is for a hidden threat, those who claim to follow our ideals in full, but lie. Their parents, and the parents of their parents, have imparted upon them reactionary ideals, which goes on to taint them throughout their lives. But, they are sly, these bourgeois parasites will do whatever it takes to remain alive until the dawning of our Russia, so that they may leech off of the state.

The tearing down and rebuilding and tearing down and rebuilding once again of the human spirit, each time approaching the Russian Socialist ideal, until at last, all at once, the spirit rose bloody and free into the air like a hatchling -\n\nSerov took a deep breath. He was getting ahead of himself, and the prisoner would no doubt need a little counseling after his revolutionary criticism. Pacifists were dangerous degenerates, weakening the Russian working class with their existence, but they, too, deserved leniency. In any case, Serov would need to fill up the paperwork for this one's transition to a full-blown laborer.\n\nTime to tidy up after himself. He gathered his notes, dense with self-references and diagrams, but at the same time marvelous in their simplicity: where Lenin and Bukharin had built an imperfect mirror, he was constructing a crystal chandelier. Its light came from within, its beauty the perfect strength and unity of its workers. An end to the class warfare and the petty materialism of the past! An end to the faux-socialism and the factional squabbles! Only the iron will of the Party and the Workers' Front, driving Russia ever onward towards the future.\n\nSerov saw it now: the Platonic brilliance of his nation, elegant as the spheres of the cosmos.

Two assault rifles hung helpfully by the sides of the emblem, in case the message wasn't clear enough. The General Secretary's name was written below, in slightly smaller subtext.\n\nAt least this one had artistic sensibility: Puchkov had seen a half-dozen artistic slaughterings of the GenSec's name by fools trying to outdo each other in flattery. This one was merely passable. It wouldn't pass through even a routine inspection under the old regime, but truth be told, the Propaganda Department of the Media Ministry was not in the best of shape. They simply didn't have the time or energy for anything different.\n\nSipping at his tea-flask, he began the work of fusing all the contradictory streams of propaganda into a single stream of thought. GenSec Serov had asked for a specifically short address, one with few words but ones of substance. Eminently suitable to a corporate board meeting, perhaps, but as an exhortation, it was a crippling limitation. Even so, Puchkov wasn't paid to take ownership of expensive failures. If there was a speech he could render from this mess, he damn well would.\n\nHe worked through the night, his paper a canvas upon which the broad brushstrokes arose of a speech. References to the power of the people here, a sideways glance to the workers as it was made, and then a cinematic turn - one in scope and physical angle - to the children.

I will explain below.\n\nThe onerous requirements of a revolution are borne with increasing ease as the soldier becomes used to the solemnity of his work - he begins to see the national citizen in their proper place, as tools to be used and destroyed for our greater glory. I believe this trend accounts for accelerating individual compliance with personal corrective orders as well - we have received increasing numbers of domestic surveillance reports (attached in addendum 4.ii.a are a sample of these reports).\n\nExtraction operations continue as is usual, with the intended effects.

The young and inexperienced were always more malleable than most. The captain cleared his throat, ready to give these recruits the pep talk of a lifetime. "Brave sons of Eurasia, I understand you've come here today wanting to know what we're up against?""YES, SIR!""Good, because I'll tell what you'll be facing: our civilization's ancient enemy. You see, when this country is united, a great test of wills awaits Eurasia. The rotten Romano-Germanic civilization has encroached upon our people's sacred lands in the west, and have claimed it as their own. Even now they attempt to remove any trace of Eurasia's culture that still remains. This cannot be allowed to stand." The colonel flicked on the projector screen behind him, revealing a detailed map of Reichskommissariat Moskowien. "As you can see, this is not just a struggle for reclamation, it is a struggle for the survival of our ethnos! Weak, Atlanticist concepts such as mercy cannot be shown when the Teuton threatens the very existence of Eurasia."He noticed some of the recruits in front becoming visibly nervous. They will understand in time, he thought. " As the great Genghis Khan did before us, we too shall make the entire world cower in fear as the unbridled fury of the Eurasian people is unleashed upon them! Their soldiers will be slaughtered, their lands and people defiled beyond recovery! Indeed, our foes have forgotten what a true war is like. We shall remind them.""

 NIK_gumilyov_regional.33.t:0 "The Paradoxical Nation"
 NIK_gumilyov_regional.33.d:0 "Of late, Lev Gumilyov's thoughts had turned, increasingly, towards the Atlanticists. In particular, towards the United States. Try as he might, he simply could not understand how they endured.\n\nLike Eurasia, it was an enormous country populated by many different social, political, and religious groups. The method by which they had arrived there was, of course, very different, but the end result was the same. And, also like Eurasia, they had been challenged, within and without, and been found wanting in both cases.\n\nBut very much unlike Eurasia, they seemed able to, somehow, always resist internal disintegration. Seemed always able to, in the end, identify themselves and others as Americans, no matter their background. Seemed always able to recover, return stronger than before, and internalize a grim determination to continue their fight.\n\nHe contemplated this while looking at an enormous map of the confusing nation. It was truly maddening. Everything he wanted for Eurasia and its peoples, that strength of purpose, that unity in the face of repeated defeats, that defense against disintegration, the Americans already possessed. He had read numerous chronicles of American history in an effort to discover whatever special steps had been taken, and found nothing.\n\nGumilyov knew well that the Revolution could, would, falter if such a spirit could not be encouraged, but he could not answer the question of how to do so. And so he found himself staring for hours at the map asking, over and over, how they had done it.\n\nHe could find no answer."

No longer.\n\nA Kazakh, the pilot had grown up a peasant, but his life had been forever changed when the Soviet Air Force chose, one day, to use the skies over his family's farm for pilot training. He had known, immediately, that he would not be content with a life of farming, and though it had taken both years and many sacrifices, he had indeed reached his goal, joining that same air force.\n\nAnd he had learned, very quickly, that the purported equality of all the Soviet peoples had been a lie. Thrown into an under-equipped and under-prepared squadron, they had been savaged by the Germans during their invasion, and during the collapse that followed, the pilot had returned to his farm, resigning himself to a quiet life.\n\nBut the Passionarist Revolution had changed all of that. He was a Kazakh, yes, but more than that he was a Eurasian, and that distinction mattered. The equality that had once been denied was now freely given, and he again was given the opportunity to fly.\n\nEagerly accepting, he had found himself in short order taking to the skies above Kazakhstan, above Eurasia, and he knew that he would never allow that land to be threatened. By outsiders or by those who did not accept the equality that was now shared. The skies of Eurasia would be open to all its peoples.\n\nFor all time."

 NIK_gumilyov_superregional.1.d:0 "The rough looking man braced himself as he watched a wind pick up over the snowy wastes of the north. As the breeze passed him over, Igor decided that he would take one last puff of his cigarette before heading back into the mine. He and his men had been assured by the government's bureaucracy that a resource extraction operation on this site would yield great rewards in gold, yet they hadn't seen more than an ounce of it in three weeks of mining.\n\nThis was meant to be his last venture with the company. All they needed to do was find a big enough vein to cover the company's costs and his debts, and he would be content to retire. He sighed, dropped his cigarette to the ground and crushed it. At this rate, he'd have to wait another decade before he could retire.\n\nNot if I die in there, he thought darkly to himself. Mournfully, Igor grabbed his pick and started back into the cave when one of his men, a younger man in his 20s, slammed into Igor, nearly knocking the both of them to the ground. Before Igor could even speak, the man clapped both hands on him and said,\n\n"Sir, we've done it! You have to come see!"\n\nEyes widened, Igor sprinted back into the cave with the man, plunging back into the sprawling depths below."

 NIK_gumilyov_superregional.2.d:0 "Gumilyov sat, deep in thought, before his hearth. This was fine firewood, he thought; dense and heavy, well-seasoned and radiating heat that pushed the frigid cold of midnight from his living room. Taking a drag on his cigarette, he idly swirled the vodka in its glass, staring into the flames.\n\nThe flames of Eurasia's passionarity were blazing with a fury unsurpassed in the history of the superethnos, but there were more concerns than just conquest. Without proper guidance, the flames would burn out of control and become a wildfire, consuming the very nation he had worked so hard to establish. He had to retain power if he was to guide Eurasia along the correct path and restrain its self-destructive urges. But the Russians...\n\nGumilyov scowled. The Russians - or rather, the Russian nationalists - didn't understand that. It was a funny idea of Eurasia they had: Russia, but with a different name and different excuses for oppressing its brother ethnoses. He had already been forced to make too many concessions to them, and their influence was steadily growing. He hadn't done all this just to see the Eurasian project succumb to the same chauvinism that fostered hatred between the ethnoses.\n\nDowning the vodka and flicking his cigarette into the fire, Gumilyov stood and headed over to his bookshelf to find something to calm his nerves. Maybe the Secret History. Genghis Khan's life was a great inspiration, after all. Someday, he would see the legendary ruler's vision fulfilled - hopefully with a little less bloodshed."

Perhaps there was hope for Eurasia after all.\n\n"My friends... my family," he began, "People of Eurasia, welcome. Today is the most auspicious day in our shared history. This is the first time that true Eurasianism has come to the very doorstep of Central Asia. Not since Genghis Khan has our superethnos been so close to total unification."\n\nHe paused for a moment, the audience rapt. What tack to take? "I... envisioned this, years ago. Our people, so long disunited, finally recognizing what binds us together. Too long have we fought over disputed borders, over faith, over petty rivalries. We alone, of all the world's civilizations, have never been able to set aside our differences and unite against those who profit from our continued division. The Atlanticists, the Romano-Germanics, the Asiatics - they have always feared and despised us, our state of barbarism serving as fuel for their propaganda machines! They regard us as mere savages, incapable of greatness, of glory, of matching their achievements! Well, I say: no more! Let us stand shoulder to shoulder, my brothers. We are closer than ever to the birth of history's greatest empire. Let it become so, I say!

Fate would benefit them however, when two government officials visited their farm one afternoon.\n\n"Good evening, Sokolov family. We are officials from the State, and we are here to inform you about the Eurasian Agricultural Initiative. Since local records indicate that your family are farmers as well as upstanding, we thought that this information would be very important to you."\n\nThe eldest of the family, Yury, would step forward, and listen with great yet careful intent. "What is so special about this initiative?" Yury glanced back toward his family, afraid that any counter-productive action would result in retaliation.\n\n"I'm glad you asked." One of the officers handed Yury a pamphlet, one which extolled the virtues of the farmer toward the State of Eurasia. The State was willing to pay for new property, subsidies toward equipment & seeds, as well as offering a stable buyer with a fair price. Everything they were denied under the WRRF, they were being offered under the Passionaryy. "Of course, you would have to move," replied the officer, "but if you are interested, visit the local Administrative Office and we will provide for our nation's finest."\n\nAs the officers walked away, Yury's eyes widened and his mind went wild as he browsed the pamphlet.

Large quantities of precious metals had been found, including the ingot that had been placed on his desk, stamped with the mark of a nation that no longer existed. He was informed that many, many more like it had been found alongside.\n\nA full inventory had been compiled, tests had confirmed their purity, a calculation of value had been performed, and transport to secure sites had been completed. The only question that remained was what to do with it all, and to Gumilyov this question was barely worth being identified as such.\n\nIt was a Eurasian metal, captured in Eurasia, and so it would be applied towards the betterment of Eurasians as a whole. There were many things the country needed, things that needed to be purchased from abroad. To do required hard currency, and there was little more suitable than that which sat in front of him.\n\nTogether the resources of Eurasia, people, metal, and otherwise, would act in unison to strengthen the nation, improve the lives of those within it, and complete the worthy and essential objectives of the Passionarist Revolution.\n\nAny other outcome was unacceptable."

These were people who, years ago, would never have even considered the idea of a singular, strong, united state able to liberate Russia from strife. Today, everyone was standing together under the Eurasian banner, and under the guidance of Gumilyov. A smile escaped his usually serious, stern face. These were his people; this was Eurasia. As he took to the podium, a round of cheering broke through the halls, and then a respectful silence to carefully listen.\n\n"Ladies and Gentlemen of Eurasia, I stand here today for all of you. No longer will we live with memories of the West Russian War, no longer will we stand separated from our grand ambitions and goals.

And, yet, if he had been asked, he could not truly have explained exactly why. Which was why the pamphlet that he had been handed in town, earlier that day, spoke to him so strongly.\n\nThe animosity between Russian and Asian was foolish, it said, a product of the efforts of the many enemies of the Eurasian state. The past where they had once fought was long ago, and were themselves merely an artefact of the need to consolidate ethnic power in response to destructive European influences.\n\nDestructive influences that now came not only from Europe but from further abroad as well. As such, the pamphlet had said the peoples of Eurasia had to move past old animosities, old legends of behavior that had not existed for generations, and old resistances to integration. They had to move forward together, and seize their deserved destiny from those who wanted nothing more than to deny it to them.\n\nIt took the farmer many hours to process what the pamphlet had said. Prejudices long held, even absurd ones, ran deep, and took time to overcome. When he locked up his house and began travelling to town once again in order to find more literature he knew he was not yet finished in doing so, but he similarly knew he would continue to work at it.\n\nHe just needed more guidance, and more time besides."

For their homeland, their people, and their religion, they fought with every tool and tactic available to them, no matter the consequences. And if all went well, the boat approaching them was to bring both new tools as well as the promises of more to follow.\n\nAs the boat reached the shore, the men moved quickly to conceal it and move its crated cargo with all haste to the shore, while their leader met the contact who had ferried the cargo across the water. Together, they shook hands and inspected the contents of one of the crates. Automatic rifles, grenades, and blocks of high explosive - all effective for their purpose but also relatively easy to conceal.\n\nThe contact informed them that, if they could guarantee receipt, he could promise another shipment the next week. As well as every week thereafter. The Chechens quickly agreed. The effort required would be enormous, but the reward promised, an even more effective way to fight the hated Germans, was impossible to ignore.\n\nReturned to the departing boat, the contact smiled as it returned across the sea.

Liberation of different ethnic peoples, from the Tatar to the Komi, would follow from the unification of Western Russia from their various warlord states. All peoples of Russia were now free to shape their own destiny; forward together under the Eurasian banner.\n\nCultural exhibitions from different ethnic groups were also showcased, providing a convenient propaganda platform as well as a chance at multicultural reconciliation between various spectators.

Everything else is secondary - the Russian people, our way of life, is infinitely superior to that of other cultures. The State is the people, and therefore to ensure the survival of the nation, one must protect the state. The world is large and cruel - it is also deadly. As an infantryman, you must be prepared to enter fatal combat, be willing to accept wound and death - but also be strong of heart, never flee the field, nor desert your comrades. Furthermore, desertion is one of the highest slights one can inflict on the Russian nation. By retreating, you are helping the enemy and will be punished as a traitor deserves. Remember: by betraying the State, either due to moral or ideological reasons, you are betraying the Russian nation and contributing to its demise. Be prepared to give your life for the state."

My brother, Sam, he and his wife just returned from a vacation in Samara.'\n'Oh yeah?' Dmitry nodded in approval as he finished up the sandwich, 'how was it?'\n'Good, good. They liked it a lot there, except the cold. Oh, and the agents too.'\nDmitry's eyes suddenly shot up at George, 'What agents?'\n'Don't know, man. Sam said they were followed by some guy in an official overcoat for the entire stay.'\nDmitry shook his head, 'Probably just imagined it.'\n'Yeah, maybe...' agreed George, 'though that's not the first time I've heard of Russia being totalitarian.'\nDmitry let out a chuckle, 'Oh, no, none of that, friend! We're a democratic republic, just like America! See,' he pointed across the street, 'we've even got our own White House!'\n'Really?'\n'Yeah, Comrade Shafarevich lives there. See, we love freedom too.

However, rumour has it that he doesn't shy away from shutting down the opposition, not too different from other despots.

We could ensure the safety of the trade fleets, guarantee a safe Northern border, among other things.

Among his outlandish claims is the idea that America 'allowed' Russia to be conquered by Germany. The United States, despite its isolationist stance, was well known to have a mighty industry and large manpower pool - the failure of the Western nations to help the Soviet Union was a major factor in its collapse. The letter has also been sent to 'important officials', namely governors and senators. Overall, this seems to be a ploy to garner public support from abroad, maybe even a plot to drag the United States into a future war, similar to that in South Africa."

 NIK_shafarevich_superregional.1.d:0 "The scene was familiar to Shafarevich. Once again, he was in his study, a candle by his side. The weak light illuminated his work, the schematics for a road, again. Chalk-dust caked his hands, and he looked at his watch. Almost dawn. Yet, this work could not wait. There were no longer fetters to his progress. No more Suslov, no more Stalina, no more Taboritsky, and, sadly, no more Gumilyov. He missed them. Enemies they were, and adversaries, yet they almost seemed to be a call-back to easier times, when he was just a mathematician with tenure in Syktyvkar's university.\n\nIt was, again, a road. Street plans, points of illumination, specifications of material. As President of the Republic, his work had come to take entire days to finish. It was rare that he got the chance to work on an independent project of his. The roads were uncluttered, clear, ways of transport that ferried the pedestrians to their places, safe and quick.\n\nHe stepped back, and clapped his hands together, dispersing clouds of white over his uniform. Shafarevich could have sent for a servant downstairs to fetch him a basin of water, but he liked it that way. They can wash his shirt and trousers later. As the sun rose on the horizon, the work's significance became clearer and clearer. A reordering of the streets of Syktyvkar, a project that would entail the destruction and reconstruction of the city. He laughed. He was proud, even if his work was pointless. Shafarevich had all the power to enforce his will, but he would not. Democracy was a useful tool, and he would like to maintain it."

Fresh-faced, and enthusiastic: faces of a new, reborn Russia. "Gentlemen," he said, silencing their chatter. "If I may have your attention." All eyes soon became focused on him. "Today, we gather here in celebration of our democratic ideas: against the nations that conspire to divide us Russians from solidarity to one another. Great were their efforts, but today, we have broken their hold on us. We, the great Russian nation, have broken the shackles placed upon us by the time of our ancestors - fulfilling our destiny."\n\nShafarevich cleared his voice. "I admit that it is rather queer for a mathematician to speak of destinies. Romantic notions are not part and parcel of my work; those kinds of thinking I will leave to others. For much of my career, I have been a theoretician, a scientist. Today, I stand before you an architect, and also an engineer. You, the deputies of this renewed legislature, are my partners in our work. Russia has chosen you; each of the deputies in this chamber Russia has elected to serve in his post. Do not fail the nation's trust in us. That is all." Shafarevich stepped down.\n\nA chorus of ovation met his wake."

It had been over an hour since he was first told to wait to apply for a form, and everyone else in the room at the time had already gone. He was wondering if he should just wait to apply for another day, when the woman at the reception desk called out his name.\n\n'Mr. Feigenbaum, you need to go to Office B-35 on the Second Floor,' she said as he went to her.\n\n'To get the form?'\n\n'Correct, sir. Then you'll need to submit it to Office E-22, and apply for a copy of the form to send to the Bureau Registrar at Office A-05 before sending it off to Office H-18. Understand?'\n\nFeigenbaum committed the instructions for navigating the bureaucratic labyrinth to memory and nodded.\n\nAfter what felt like half an hour trying to navigate the identical-looking office halls to find Office B-35, Feigenbaum sat down at that office reception. He didn't even bother to keep track of the time after that when another receptionist called his name. He asked for his form when she shook her head.\n\n'I'm sorry. The receptionist downstairs made a mistake. You need a copy of Form 2834-R before I can give you the voter registration form. You can get it at Office E-48, three floors up and down to the right. I'm sorry if it sounds complex, but due to incidents of past voter fraud we need to keep thorough records of every potential voter.'\n\nFeigenbaum's mouth dropped as he exited the room, failing to notice what Office E-48 was labelled on the building map that he stomped past in frustration."

However, the man, whose name was Borisyuk, not a priest giving a sermon, but a member of the Russian National Party, the ruling party of the new democratic regime. That did not make what he was speaking about no less interesting than the Bible.\n\nOver the course of a few hours he talked of how the Passionarriyy believed in traditional Russian values; of God, the Church and the family which made many of the villagers nod their heads or murmur amongst themselves in agreement. After giving his speech, Borisyuk took a brief break to take questions.\n\n'Sir,' a man in the back asked, 'You said the closest polling station is the district capital. That's a 5-hour walk on a good day. Is there any way we can get there any faster?'\n\n'An excellent question,' Borisyuk replied, 'In fact, the RNP will offer free public transportation to polling stations for everyone who supports the party. Transport by bus to the district capital will take less than an hour.'\n\nThe villagers mumbled amongst themselves. Free transportation for RNP voters? It was a long time since any form of organized public transport came to these parts of Russia; even cars were hard to come by except for the well-to-do these days. The entire church burst into applause and cheers over the promise, as each villager made their own plans to vote for the RNP in the coming elections."
