 ##IDEAS##
 SYO_Zaibatsu:0 "Influential Zaibatsus"
 SYO_Zaibatsu_desc:0 "Syonan's position as a satellite state of Japan has led to many things both politically and economically, but a prominent example of the latter is economic domination by the Japanese conglomerates known as Zaibatsus. The Zaibatsus work with inhumane conditions on poor Malaysian laborers for long hours and little to no pay, effectively creating a system of slavery. However, this isn't so important compared to the flames of everything else Syonan has to deal with."

 SYO_Dai-nijyugo:0 "Home of the 25th Army"
 SYO_Dai-nijyugo_desc:0 "General Sōsaku Suzuki leads the men who conquered the Jewel of British East Asia, and still continues to do so even after the war's end. One of the most respected men in the Imperial Japanese Army, Suzuki continues to represent the mighty 25th Army. The 25th Army continues to act as a military garrison to shore up the defenses of the native Sultans, and also to protect any shipping that sails through the Straits of Johor. Clearly, they are one of Japan's proudest armies, and as such, have some of the best equipment and officers. However, due to their inactivity, their skills have gradually worsened over time..."

 SYO_minority:0 "Substantial Chinese Minority"
 SYO_minority_desc:0 "While Syonan is governed by the majority Malay (with help from the Japanese), there exists a large Chinese minority in the peninsula nation, as well, and although most of these Chinese have been in Syonan since the 19th century, they continue to face discrimination from the Malay majority. This inter-ethnic violence has manifest itself in rioting and crime against the Chinese by ethnic Malay, and the Chinese have tended to move towards anti-government movements as a response."
 
 ###LEADER DESCRIPTIONS###
 POLITICS_SULTAN_IBRAHIM_DESC:0 "The Sultans have been a part of Malayan culture for a very, very long time. Their traditional role as cultural icons, ceremonial figureheads and focal points in Malay identity placated a population that never grew entirely comfortable with the British colonial yoke. Their roles as collaborators continued even when the British crests were torn from the buildings and replaced with the Rising Sun. Sultan Ibrahim is the latest in this line of collaborators, a ceremonial sultan whose presence in government affairs theoretically lends credence to the actions of the Syonan City government and unites the peoples under its rule. This is the way Malaya has always worked. \n\nBut a New Malaya is rising under the aging Sultan's nose, and he cannot stop it. For Japanese boots and corporate brutality have alienated his people from him, and racial divides stretching all the way to brilliant, broken Syonan-To itself have fractured his country. Resistance grows to his nominal rule from every corner. Some say the National Congress, the only jurisdictive entity under his sole control, is simmering with revolt. And in the hills of Perak and Johore the spectre of Revolution looms, and the ghost of Chin Peng haunts the Sultan's dreams. The Sultan himself is powerless, and behind the ceremonies his own relatives in the Sultanates rap their fingers in anticipation.\n\nFor the Sultan himself is dying, and few will mourn his loss. In his wake, Syonan, Malaya and the Japanese will find a world stripped of illusions. Perhaps the greatest gift he can offer them, therefore, is the future he will provide in his wake. Malaya waits, and beyond it, the Tiger holding its leash."
 SYO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Located at one of the most important strategic points in the world, the "Light of the South" is one of the crown jewels of the Japanese Empire. The young nation has become a bustling home of immigrants, all seeking a better life. This has only served to the internal divide between the city of Shonan itself, where many of the Japanese and Chinese migrants have gravitated to, and the rest of the nation which itself is further divided between native Malayans, Chinese, and Indians. To compact this the agining ruler Sultan Ibrahim of Johor is on his last legs, putting the nation at a crossroads; to look beyond race in an attempt to reform or to wallow in this status quo divide. While both may lead to more pain, will this young yet ancient nation be able to stand on it's own two legs in the end?"

 syo.0.t:0 "Syonan- Light of the South"
 syo.0.d:0 "Malaya and Singapore found themselves as one of the old British Empire's graveyards. The total rout and surrender of it's commonwealth garrison in February 1942, while morale crushing, would not be the empire's last. Since then, the former colony found itself under the grip of the Japanese and their collaborators.\n\n Education was now conducted in Nippon-Go. Veneration of the Emperor and mass celebrations of anniversaries in the imperial calendar were enforced. The local economy was squeezed dry to support Japanese efforts. To finalise this 'rebirth', Singapore was renamed to Syonan, the Light of the South.\n\nIn Malaya, the Sultanates were kept intact and given just enough autonomy to their relief, but Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were transferred to Thailand. Soon a wave of Japanese businessmen and emigrants made the peninsula their home.\n\nBy 1962, Syonan remains an important part of Japan's wider empire, with its rich raw resources fueling its blossoming population. Under the surface however, resentment against the Japanese has never been stronger."

 syo.4.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention Meets"
 syo.4.desc:0 "Daylight comes slow and uneasy over Kuala Lumpur. It's a gentle rousing for what will come to be known as the Month of Trouble: fitful the sun ascends over the rugged spine of Malaya, Titiwangsa Range, and as a dozen convoys descend on the Capitol Building (still half-covered with the work of frenetic renovation) it shines harsh over the streets of the Filipino Town, so called for the Army personnel in residence who were veterans of action on Mindanao in the Fifties. Already-clogged streets fill to the point of bursting and beyond. Media vans converge on the government buildings, bureaucrats and ever-watchful Kempeitai fill the streets with as little discretion as they can muster. It will be a dangerous month - the police watch is doubled, searches are implemented on all entering the capital, and profiling of the many slummers in the teeming shantytowns surrounding KL proceeds with an irregular energy.\n\nThe Convention must decide the structure of Malaya in the days to come, and the Malay-Nationalists (as well as many convicted of the necessity of legislative reform in the Straits) have rallied around the idea of a Federation. The proposed flag, somehow leaked to the press almost immediately after its creation, flies everywhere, out of windows and laundry-poles and on streets, scuffed and defiant. The other alternative is, well, more of the same: and the elite of Malaya, be they Japanese or Malay or Chinese, have rallied around the idea that the Sultans and their attendant powers are key to preserving the peace in Malaya. It might not be the best-supported idea, but it's the line the elites are comfortable with, and who can argue with the logic of convenience?\n\nThe delegates meet at the break of dawn. Lee, Tunku, Yaacob, the Sultans and Sultan Omar and particular are all present. It is here that the future will be decided - or lost; Malaya awaits the results."
 syo.4.a:0 "Malaya steps into the future today."

 syo.5.t:0 "Centralization Of Powers"
 syo.5.desc:0 "The first question, and the most pertinent to those assembled, concerns the centralization of powers. The vaguely worded constitution, a direct result of the post-war confusion of reorganization, toes the line between fully central governance from Syonan-To and a commitment to local governance based on Sultanate and Province. For the most part the main beneficiaries of this policy have been the Sultans, who have used their nebulous powers to guide industry and economy with a gentle hand (if one ignores the signs of gross corruption in many states).\n\nLee Kuan Yew, with Lim Yew Hock firmly behind him, proposes to definitively correct this flaw by formally adopting a federal structure wherein central executives are chosen by parties who have won a plurality of state elections. The teeming slums and shantytowns will be afforded something resembling a genuine voice, if they are given more control over local politics: so too will Syonan-To, a fact which Lee's critics are quick to point out. On the other hand, Tunku Abdul-Rahman is in favor of the centralisation of governance through codified laws that affirm a central constituency and the veto-power of executives: the reach of UMNO, which he controls, favors a centralized state to make the radical adjustments he proposes to governance and policymaking. In any case, he reasons in his appeals, a divided Malaya is not something its people can long afford: it is a shark-filled sea, and land is not yet in sight. Many agree.\n\nThe issue is set before the Convention, and it is a hard fought fight. Eventually a solution emerges."
 syo.5.a:0 "Federal Governance it shall be!"
 syo.5.b:0 "Centralized Authority is what we need!"

 syo.6.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: The Sultan's Position And Powers"
 syo.6.desc:0 "The next topic of the council is one that there is at least some degree of consensus on. The issue of Sultan-centric governance has united the Syonanese people on one thing, namely that Sultan-centric governance is a thing of the past, and should be left in the past with all due haste. Sultan Saifuddien, for the most part, agrees - he is the first to raise a bill that proposes the immediate limiting of the Sultan's executive powers to that of a purely ceremonial role, managing diplomatic affairs as the Yang-Di Pertuan Negara. This is met with more or less unanimous approval: even the Japanese-influenced delegates understand that the time of Sultans is past.\n\nThe precise form the Sultans and the Yang-Di Pertuan Negara shall assume, however, is still up in the air: here the Convention splits, as it is so prone to doing. Tunku Abdul-Rahman proposes the use of Sultanate-authority as a bridge to the vital religious affairs of the Malay Community and as a sort of grassroots leadership which governments can draw upon for guidance - and, if necessary, control of the masses they are answerable to. This will enable the Sultanates to remain somewhat in control of their constituents, but fully subordinate to the State and its diktats. Lim Yew Hock, ever the businessman, has a more economic plan: the Sultans shall become wealth-fund managers, responsible for the cultivation of the state treasuries, and their administrations shall be pared down to accountants and investors. This will lower the burdens of the Government and allow for Sultans to play some degree of responsibility in handling their vast estates. It will also, however, totally isolate them from political power, which does not go unnoticed.\n\nThe debate becomes unexpectedly bitter - historical baggage has a way of poisoning discourse. Nevertheless, a vote must be held, and a decision reached: and so, in the usual fumbling manner, it is."
 syo.6.a:0 "Keep the Sultans as leaders of the people in spirit!"
 syo.6.b:0 "Sultans should stick to the checkbook, not politicking!"


 syo.7.t:0 "The Light In The South"
 syo.7.desc:0 "Syonan-to is a beautiful place in the Pacific dawn. Glittering skyfront touches earth and reaches the smog-cast sky, industrial and refinery flame glinting off the sides of zaibatsu windows. Chatter reaches the streets and spills into the tea-houses, the hotels and the factories in a garbled mix of Malay, Chinese, Japanese and residual English (the trade tongue of old has not yet been lost). Businesses open in the thousands and wait for the bounty of the trade-routes to reach their doorstep in lorries and automobiles, curling in from roads so overcrowded and undermaintained they have become a focal point of political debate. And the slums awaken too: the coolies and the workers of the new Light of the South, the burning oil under the blazing lamp, must throw themselves anew into the blazing brilliance of the Jewel of the Sphere. What does it matter if a few do not return?\n\nThe Politicians in the Diet worry, as they often do, about the thousand issues that keep the city down: trade infrastructure is falling apart due to frequent use and occasional Communist sabotage, the 18th raid on Chin Peng has ended in a self-declared victory and no body to show for it, the Malays and Indians are continuing to push for greater autonomy in self-funded schools (ignoring the generous Zaibatsu donations that made them possible) and, of course, the Sultans have it in for the annoyingly successful city in their rear. Above it all the Japanese population, proud and unbowed and utterly insufferable: and below them the Chinese, endless and long-suffering, like gargoyles supporting angels on a crumbling cathedral wall.\n\nIt's peace. Of a sort. But one thing is for sure: nothing ever lasts long in the swelter of heat and the glitz of the endless marketplace - and who can say what the next morning will bring, gold or fire?"
 syo.7.a:0 "The city that can't sleep."

 syo.8.t:0 "Fire At The Coffeehouse"
 syo.8.desc:0 "Most riots simmer long before the streets fill with fire and trash. They curl in the damp spaces too soft for the ears of the police, stretching tendrils of gossip and suspicion with every half-whisper, and it is there that the anger curdles to hatred - and then to violence. Riots are made long before they break out, long before the government catches word: and so this is where the Syonan-To Riot begins, outside a damp sake-soaked coffeehouse on the outskirts of the Central District, far beyond the ears of the Kempeitai and the Diet, on a day that will fade from history when it is over.\n\nIt begins, as with most things, with a conversation that carries on far too long for comfort. The participants are lost to history, perhaps forever - the controversial has a way of being blotted out in Syonan, for the public good - but this is known: some at the coffeehouse on October 13th are Japanese businessmen, some are Chinese middle-class civil servants, some are Malay and Indian shopkeepers. All have been brought to gossip by the latest round of Zaibatsu import quotas imposed from Tokyo, but none have agreeing views on the matter. The Chinese civil servants are sharpest and most bitter in their criticism: the yoke of taxation and overwork is endemic, but falls hardest on them. The Japanese businessmen view the men in Tokyo as right, but misguided in their aims - the Indians and Malays, of course, are worried about the dominance of Japanese firms, and why shouldn't they be? Nobody can ignore the slow collapse of the old Indian-Malay economic holdings in a land that is still called Malaya by some. \n\nThree viewpoints, one point of division, an argument that feeds on itself and grows to inebriated, incendiary heights. The owner later testifies to a bar brawl that is only broken up by the police, but the main participants flee ahead of time. One of them promises that in a week, Japanese holdings will go up in flames across Malaya - and then he is gone, a Cassandra lost in the hot wind of the Malayan night."

 syo.9.t:0 "The Tinder, The Spark, The Match"
 syo.9.desc:0 "Anger continues to grow in the week after the coffeehouse incident (which is quickly shushed up by local authorities, lest it trigger the ever-watching and ever-tetchy Garrison Authorities), just not in public spaces. The Kempeitai have toned down considerably from their monstrous heights, preferring calm corruption to brutality, but they are still capable and dangerously competent when it comes time for them to do their dirty work. The whispers grow and grow and grow to fever pitch, just out of sight, dancing like fireflies atop a placid lake, and then - \n\nOctober 17th: Sumitomo announces a round of minor economic restructuring in the Syonan-To branch, laying off a few dozen employees to integrate a new branch of Tokyo-based operation chain managers. Most of those laid off are Malay and Indian. Not many are affected, but to many already suspicious of the Zaibatsu concerns this is proof that the Japanese intend to push out local concerns and uproot native industry, yoking Malaya permanently to the Sphere. Security guards report fistfights at the factory and angered rhetoric in the ethnic enclaves of the East and Central districts, calls to action - and to arms.\n\nOctober 19th: A Chinese coolie is found murdered off a hotel. The details are sketchy at first reportage. Due to subsequent circumstances, the body is only partially examined before subsequent events make further inquiries impossible. Notable eyewitnesses to the body include several Japanese businessmen and managers, a few policemen - and a gang of Chinese from the endless slums of the central and north. The latter engage in a hasty retreat, but not before promising vengeance for the spilt blood.\n\nOctober 20th: mobs of Chinese, Malays and Indians are marching in the city, roused to anger by the fear and the rhetoric surrounding them. The Prophet's Birthday celebrations went off smoothly a few months back with adequate crowd control, but the local Guard make 2 critical mistakes: they send a single detachment, and every single member of the detachment is a Japanese officer."

 syo.10.t:0 "Burning In The Dawn"
 syo.10.desc:0 "It's unclear what exactly triggers the riots, given the subsequent chaos that follows the riots. The exact circumstances are lost to police reports that burn with the rest of the government buildings. Some later voice suspicions that the Diet has had a hand covering up the evidence - these voices are quickly silenced, by means that are either legal or... well, there's plenty of room under the dockyards for those who will not abide by the rules of the game.\n\nThis much is clear: 2 mobs meet on Rochor Street, separated by a thin line of Japanese guards. The men are recruits sent straight from barracks, and limited in their comprehension of the local lingua franca: stuttering Malay does nothing to ease already troubled hearts, especially when some of those troubled hearts are Chinese. The detachment commander asks to speak to the head of the two demonstrations, believing that they are part of a joint protest. For his mistake he is mocked in languages he cannot comprehend, as the crowd swells beyond the bounds of the street, cowing local shopkeepers into submission. The Diet, of course, is silent. The crowds don't trust each other: the middle-class Malays and Indians see the Chinese as saboteurs and worse, the Chinese despise the Malays and Indians uplifted by Japanese benevolence while they have been struck down under their boot.\n\nFaced with a situation he cannot control, the commander radios his base for aid and backup: this is where accounts diverge. Chinese protestors swear up and down that he orders the police to fire on them. Indian protestors swear that the police are ordered to ignore the Chinese and push back the Malays and Indians. The news spreads to the entirety of the crowds in both variants, becoming exponentially more incendiary as it gathers pace and fury. Both mobs surge forward at the same time in a desperate attempt to pre-empt an attack they believe is inevitable, overwhelming the thin blue line. The commander is never seen again."
 syo.10.a:0 "Oh shit."

 syo.11.t:0 "Burning In The Day"
 syo.11.desc:0 "The riot rages on the street and spreads beyond it. Word of mouth is a powerful thing, and cannot be controlled - virality translates to memetic discourse very well. Threats, fears and pain become more dangerous as the crowds rush by huddled families, and the urge to revenge grows more tangible with the thudding heart. And underneath it all the resentments of the old years fester and break into a bloody blossom. Mobs and gangs raise hell on the streets, barricading factories and wrecking any house that seems, in the words of a gang member who is later interrogated, 'too rich, too powerful, too big, too Japanese.'\n\nViolence begets violence as the Garrison struggle to execute a collective response in the wake of unparalleled violence since the Conquest of Malaya itself. Residents retreat to enclaves, take up rusty parangs and bayonets, and prepare to kill those who seem a threat. (Many villagers protect ethnic outliers in their hometowns, an act of quiet defiance that goes more or less unnoticed by everyone else.) Rage quickly spreads to the economic dimension - and to the political, as the Police Commissioner's Office is burnt to the ground, along with many prominent Zaibatsu offices. The Diet faffles and waits for order to be restored, pulling soldiers from vital defense positions to protect itself. Malayan sultans unequivocally condemn the riots almost as hard as they condemn the Diet for its inaction. The Diet might be incapable of handling its own turf, but at least it can be roused to angry self-defense: the war of words that follows makes the entirety of Syonanese governance seem even more pathetic as the death toll rises outside the glass windows. \n\nIn a famous image, the burning of the city dusts the skyline and the horizon above it in a thick cloud of soot: reporters speculate that the smoke and soot come from the destruction of an armaments storehouse near Keppel, destroyed to prevent 'Communist Saboteurs' from reaching the warehouse and looting it. No evidence of Communist infiltration of the demonstrations is ever found."

We believe that this surprising precedent will only spell greater promise for the fledgeling Malayan Film industry - '\n\n' - the synopsis is deeper than you think. Look at the plot!

That's right, a Zaibatsu.

P. Ramlee is a mask, a smiling tribute to all who know him: and behind that mask is a brilliant nothingness, as far as Syonan is concerned. Who is P. Ramlee? The answer seems to be that he is anyone the people of Malaya want him to be - reformist, smiling establishment supporter, militant Muslim, cheerful secularist, anyone's ally and no one's true friend. Deflection is, after all, a form of reflection, and who doesn't want to see themselves reflected in Malaya's greatest film star. But who is Teuku Zakaria? When P. Ramlee takes off his mask and his suit and steps out of the limelight, who does he become?\n\nWe step into his house, a pleasant terraced house in the classier suburbs of Kuala Lumpur, and we're met with a strong scent of jasmine: apparently Saloma, or simply Salmah Ismail, as she likes to be called, likes the smell of perfume, and so Zakaria has made great efforts to buy perfume. He smiles at us and makes small talk about the weather as she bustles about the kitchen: despite their 7 year long marriage the two have never had a child, a fact the two attribute to their busy career (both of them have, of course, shared the set for a very long time in film and music).\n\nHis face grows serious when we begin to discuss his most prominent comments on the growing racial and economic divides in Syonan-To and in urban areas in Malaya proper: he brings up the subject of his childhood in an impoverished home and how the Japanese saved him from a life of penury by bringing him to Navy School and subsequently to Tokyo, where his career began. 'If not for the Japanese, I would have been poor all my life!' he chuckles, and then grows serious once more: 'So what makes me so different from the coolies and starving outside?
