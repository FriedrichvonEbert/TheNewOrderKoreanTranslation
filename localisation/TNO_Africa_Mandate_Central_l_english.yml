Our mandate extends through the massive Congo basin, and its myriad of peoples, factions and companies are now our responsibility. Exerting control over the massive territory will prove a big challenge, but it is one that is worth worth taking on. Extractive industries made RK Zentralafrika far and away the most lucrative of the Nazi colonies, wealth that should be made to work for the cause of freedom instead of tyranny.\n\nThe task set out for us will not be easy. We must defeat the remnants of resistance and extend our reach throughout the colony. We must identify native leadership candidates and make the Congolese see that working with us gives them the best hope for their future. We'll also need to convince the remaining Belgians and Germans, and the powerful corporate entities they control, that compliance is their only option.

The German administration did us no favors on its way out, and up to now we've had our work cut out for us simply finding our feet and gaining a rough overview of our situation. One of the first lessons we're learning is the sheer volume of tedious, day to day, practical and administrative tasks we've taken on. Day by day, the ad-hoc arrangements set up to deal with these issues up to now are eating up more and more time and causing more and more frustration to our officers. Clearly, we need to formalize a more efficient administration to deal with them.\n\nWe currently lack firm support from the natives, and a lot of the other locals are still tainted by their association with the old regime. Compounded by our thus far minimal capacity to properly vet and recruit, we have a limited pool to draw on. We will incorporate the Congolese we know and trust, but the brunt of the administration will have to be made up by our officers, at least at this stage of our mission."

Leaving these men to their own devices might prove dangerous, as they possess connections throughout the Congo and a knowledge of local matters that outrstrips ours. Should they decide to work against us, they could be a big nuisance indeed. That must not happen.\n\nWe must convince them instead that their best choice for the future is to support our administration. The first step to that end is to show them that they can still have a role to play in the Congo, which we can begin doing by incorporating the most willing into the lower rungs in our hierarchy.

A soldier at heart, he was never comfortable in the role as de-facto administrator, and the pent-up resentment at being handed crisis after crisis by Müller without ever being given the means to properly resolve any of them has left him very willing to consider working for different masters. So will the prospect of safety from the CIA, who have been on his trail since the end of the war.\n\nBy offering amnesty and reliable pay, we could turn Steiner into a formidable asset for our administration. Through him and his long list of contacts, we will finally gain access to the formidable mercenary companies employed by Zentralafrika, and their decades of experience operating under the local conditions. His insider knowledge in the previous administration could prove a useful resource as well."

Our new administration will be built from the ground up by the good and trustworthy American men and women under our leadership, helped by those we've found to be dependable among the natives. A clean break with the old regime will show the locals that we mean what we say about change coming to Africa, and ensure the fruits of our labour aren't siphoned off by corrupt bureaucrats and greedy corporations.

Bringing together investors from the OFN and Central Africa, the Consortium will be a welcome source of capital, knowledge and new technologies for our Mandate.

While forced to pay the upkeep to maintain the massive structure, the German administration was never able to make use of more than a fraction of the potential power generation of the dam. As we work to unshackle the economic potential of our Mandate, that state of affairs is sure to change.\n\nBeyond power generation, the dam is a key part of our infrastructure, as its sluices form the link between shipping on the Congo lake and on the Congo river. It's also the single greatest point of vulnerability for Central Africa. Should the dam fail, by malice or incompetence, the flooding will be catastrophic.\n\nThis makes the dam too important to risk leaving to unreliable local leadership. Instead, continued control by the Mandate is the best way to keep the structure in safe, competent hands. We will establish a "Congo Dam Zone'' after the model of the Panama Canal, to formalize this arrangement and ensure OFN stewardship for the future."

The truth of the matter is that left to the natives, Africa would explode into an orgy of border wars and tribal feuds as they seek to settle old scores and secure their power.\n\nPromoting development for the natives, ensuring them a place in the administration, building self-sufficient states, these concerns are all well and good and play well back home. Ultimately, however, they are secondary and tertiary to the mission.

While certainly in part a result of Müllers famously "hands-off" approach to governorship, we've reasons to assume this was also a desired state of affairs by many - we've already uncovered enough rackets going on in the territory to make anyone want to hide their trail.\n\nRegardless of its root cause, the lack of records means we have our work cut out for us even more than we previously believed. We still need to establish working knowledge on the myriad of territories, corporations, tribes and other groupings we find ourselves in charge of, and it's becoming clear that the last regime has left us little to go on."

While the official line painted this as a result of "superior German administration", it was well-known that much of the economy circumvented that administration almost entirely. In reality, the territory was a haven for foreign investors, both in its extractive sectors and as a gateway to the wider Reich.\n\nWe have started to go through the papers left to us by the old regime, and while Müller kept poor records generally, we've found some surprisingly detailed accounts on their deals with foreign entities. We should open these books and learn how these deals, investments, contracts and practices made the Zentralafrikan economy generate so much wealth."

Tribal kingdoms, corporate concessions and colonial "trust territories", remnants from the Belgian days, dot the country, all used to running their affairs with minimal oversight. This decentralization might be key to how Müller kept a functioning economy despite his other, major flaws and we might want to tread carefully to avoid upsetting it just yet.\n\nBefore we upend the old order, we need to understand how it works and how it relates to the economy. If we are to replicate the successes of Müllers system, we must learn as much as we can on how it operates. We'll take a deep dive into the papers and accounts we have left from the old days.

As things stand, the majority of the Germans, Belgians, corporations and tribal kings that keep the country running seem willing to work with our administration. Dissolving their concessions, trust territories and tribal kingdoms will only serve to turn all of these groups against our administration.\n\nWe certainly won't be as passive as the old regime, but we will maintain its decentralization.

The extractive nature of the Central African economy, while profitable, is very vulnerable to economic shocks and dependent on foreign refineries, processing plants and manufacturers. To remedy that weakness, the "Belgian plan" aims to direct significant investment toward building up a domestic resource processing industry.\n\nSchramme portrays this as the natural direction of the Congolese economy. New factories and processing plants will finally utilize the generation capacity of the great Congo Dam. The very low wages paid to labourers in the Congo means that they can pay premium wages by local standards, a great boon to the natives who will be staffing the factories, and still undercut foreign manufacturers. The backing of wealthy Belgians means funding will be independent of our administration.\n\nAll the Belgians need, he says, is assurance that their efforts won't be stymied by the corrupt and ineffective governance that is all too common in our territory. The only assurance they will accept, it appears, is to have their own men and women make up more of that governance."

The latter quality is one that we can't reproduce, the former is one that we won't.\n\nTo avoid replicating the unsustainable practices of the past, we must build our administration from the ground up. Overseen by the loyal men and women in our officer corps, the new system of governance will provide transparent, responsible administration to a territory sorely needing it.

When Siegfried Müller boarded his plane and fled West, many of them followed.\n\nWe need to get the economy back to its previous heights fast. A working economy will provide a legitimacy boost to our administration and generate funds we can use to expand it.

If their current owners won't get them running, we'll find new ones who will, and under the new "Abrams Plan" we will have a framework to do so. All places of business must report their activity to our administration or face expropriation, and these expropriated businesses will then be redistributed to selected American companies known for reliability and skill.

Old investors will be assured that we won't place undue burdens on their businesses, and new ones will be wooed by the promises of exploiting its resources under safe, American, custodianship.

As we've made the area more secure, however, we're finally ready to open it up again. Starting now, we will let anyone who wishes to do business on the lake start up shipping and transportation.

General Abrams, on his part, is less concerned about this threat and more concerned about keeping such a potent force on the sidelines. The Mercenaries have valuable experience fighting all over Central Africa, and a knowledge of local conditions and terrain which far outstrips our own. And all it'll take to harness that expertise and make it work for us is money.\n\nAbrams will meet with mercenary leaders and offer them a deal. They will form a paramilitary force, performing the tasks our own forces are unable or unwilling to do and extending our reach throughout Central Africa.

They form the cornerstone of the economy in the Kasaï and Katanga regions by employing countless laborers, and their owners also act as a major stabilizing force in the regions. This is a state of affairs we should aim to maintain.\n\nRight now, the plantations are in a pitiful state, a result of the ravages in the closing stages of the war.

Added together, they painted a pretty clear picture of the situation in the far-flung regions of his territory. While the war had done its share of damage to the economic infrastructure of Central Africa, the fall of Müller's administration had not led to a breakdown in order on the ground.\n\nThe reason was not encouraging. Under Müller, a messy patchwork of local tribal kings, corporations, plantation owners, and settler organizations had ruled their little fiefdoms almost completely independently from Leopoldville.\n\nAbrams looked over to the second stack of papers on his desk, the summaries of the documents left behind by his predecessor. Just like the regional reports, they were in full agreement. After weeks of poring through the paper-trails of Müller and Steiner, what they'd learned could be summarized as "not much".

Apparently, the looters and squatters who'd broken into the place during the closing chapters of the war had done remarkably little structural damage, and the refurbishments necessary to reopen the resort could be done quickly and at reasonable cost.\n\nThe other folder contained an intelligence brief which detailed the pervasiveness of the compound in resistance propaganda and its status as a symbol of inequality and oppression. In the propaganda war, it cautioned, a reopening of the resort would play into the hands of those wishing to paint the Mandate as just another colonial oppressor.\n\nIt was proving a tough decision to make. On one hand, the resort was already drawing interest from adventurous businessmen, and he'd have no problem finding investors in the venture, which would give the ailing economy in the region a much needed shot in the arm. On the other, the opulent luxury of the place was a constant reminder of colonial excess.\n\nA decision was needed, and Abrams resolved to..."

 OFN_COG.10.desc:0"We awoke today to the news of a major sabotage action against Route 1, the primary road heading West from Léopoldville. Approximately 80 km from the capital, an as of yet unknown rebel group has detonated an explosive, triggering a landslide which has rendered the road useless.\n\nThe main result of the action is that the capital is now cut off from Libreville and the rest of the coast north of the Congo river. The disruption to traffic extends to many of the surrounding areas, paralysing the entire region.\n\nOur forces have scrambled to close the road and limit the worst disruption, but we expect problems to persist until the obstruction is cleared, which will take a week at minimum.\n\nThis is just the latest and most brazen of a series of similar strikes, all aiming to disrupt our operations and force an earlier exit from the Mandate."

 OFN_COG.11.desc:0"We've received bad news this morning as reports filter in from the provinces.\n\nDuring the night, one of our production complexes was the subject of a destructive raid targeting storage facilities and machinery. In a precise strike, the attackers succeeded on both fronts, making away with the finished ammunition in storage and leaving a useless factory behind.\n\nThe familiarity with the factory shown by the precision of the attack, taken together with accounts from the defending soldiers, indicate the perpetrators to be a group of German holdouts. Operating as a cross between a mercenary band and a bandit troupe, the raiders and groups like them have been growing bolder and more active in the recent months."

 OFN_COG.12.t:0"Rebels organizing"
 OFN_COG.12.desc:0"Abrams had been considering his administration's rapport with the natives one of his successes - the fact that several of the reports on his desk came from friendly nationalist groups were a testament to that - but it was time to accept that he couldn't align them all. That was the picture painted by the assembled intelligence.\n\nWhether out of distrust in his administration or the simple realization that they'll lose come the elections, many of the smaller independence groups had taken up arms, and were spreading chaos in an ever-expanding share of the Mandate.\n\nThere was no polite way to put it. They were losing control, and if Abrams didn't act fast, the situation could soon explode into chaos."

 OFN_COG.13.t:0"German Holdouts Organizing"
 OFN_COG.13.desc:0"Abrams looked over his notes and the folders spread out on his desk. Five separate reports, all pointing to the same, stark, conclusion.\n\nThe German holdouts, who had been operating as a cross between mercenaries and bandits, were still growing more active by the day. Worse, they were seemingly shifting their focus to target his administration and economic interests more specifically. It seemed the Germans were organizing into a more cohesive force, one which could wreak a lot of damage if left unchecked.\n\nIt was an unacceptable situation. The General couldn't, and wouldn't, let the Germans creep back in and undermine the mission and the Mandate. They had to be stopped!\n\nAbrams had already resolved to organize a new operation. He'd have to put off some of his other plans and draw down some garrisons, but that was a price he would just have to pay."

 OFN_COG.14.desc:0"In recent weeks, reports of strikes and clashes in the Congolese territories have intensified far beyond normal levels. Preliminary intelligence has confirmed our fears that Patrice Lumumba is the organizer behind the attacks, and it seems clear that his Congolese National Movement, previously content with securing and consolidating its power, is now in open rebellion.\n\nAlarmingly, this shift in priorities also seems to have opened the door to revolutionary extremists from Cameroon. Under the banner of the "Parti Solidaire Africain", these fighters are rapidly infiltrating the Congo Basin, and our limited contact has shown them to be an effective force, well trained in guerilla warfare and small unit tactics by their puppet masters in Yaoundé."

 OFN_COG.15.t:0"Clashes between local authorities and African SS"
 OFN_COG.15.desc:0"With a curt nod, Abrams dismissed the intelligence officer. This latest briefing had only served to confirm what a string of incident reports had already led him to believe: Former Afrika-SS elements had organized in the North of the Mandate and were launching strikes against the administration and its forces.\n\nIt wasn't a very surprising development, in fact, he had half-expected it - the decision to blacklist ex-SS members was always going to be seen as a hostile act and put them at odds with the new regime. Still, the speed at which they had organized, the wide reach of their strikes, and the ferocity with which they'd resisted, and even pushed back his forces, were sources of concern. Eliminating their poisonous influence would be more difficult than he'd hoped."

 OFN_COG.16.t:0"Chaos in the Interior"
 OFN_COG.16.desc:0""You have to give the order to stand down, General. It's over!"\n\nAbrams knew the officer was right. His administration in Central Africa was in full collapse, and rebel groups were swarming across its corpse, eager to plunder whatever they could from the chaos. The Mandate had failed, and the best they could do now was to prevent the further loss of American servicemen.\n\nStill, it pained him to admit defeat, and worse, his hand in the making of the current disaster.\n\nHe had tried to stem the tide of raids, riots, abductions, and executions, but they had only grown in frequency until they were a fact of life in the Congo. Where the rebels could reach, the people suffered, and it was Abrams' responsibility for letting it happen.\n\n"You're right. It's over. Show me the order and I'll sign it, Major. Let's get out of here."\n\nWhat next for Central Africa? The myriad of rebel groups seemed to have coalesced under the umbrellas of Mobutu's "Military Council of the Revolution", the Cameroonian-backed "Parti Solidaire Africain", and the Congolese Republicans.\n\nAs the current free for all settled and the fronts between the groups stabilized, the General expected a vicious conflict between the revolters. They all wanted to be the sole masters of Central Africa, and only one could succeed in the end."

 OFN_COG_flavor.1.desc:0 "3 AM in Brazzaville. As the night faded and a new day was about to begin, the clubs of the city started to close one by one. Bright lights and cleaning ladies were enough to expel most casual clubgoers, but one small group of three American businessmen braved the storm, steadfast in their resolve to cling to their tiny bottle service table as long as possible. One particularly red face mused about his feelings, blissfully unaware of the fact that neither of his companions were in any state to comprehend his barely coherent ramblings.\n\n“A-anyways, you know what I always wanted to do? Ride one of these thrones, man. You know, these thrones on a stretcher that get carried by six or eight blacks. God, I bet that would feel awesome.”\n\nSomeone grumbled in agreement, disapproval, or for no reason at all. Whatever it may have been, the young Californian interpreted it as a request to please continue with his fascinating proposition - and so, he did.\n\n“I mean, just imagine it. I’d be like King George up there, you know. Lazily giving directions while eating grapes or something. Pure class.”\n\nThe grumbler grumbled again. This time, the young orator took it as a signal of disagreement, a voice telling him that this idea was both incredibly silly and simply not right. He attempted to argue against the man and perhaps even his own consciousness, ready to smash their unjustified concerns with solid, undeniable facts.\n\n“Don’t get me wrong, man. I’m not some kind of slave driver or anything. These blacks would be paid. It would be a win-win thingy - hell, it’s basically charity if you think about it.”\n\nThis was the last thing he said before he passed out. He passed out with a smile - after all, he was the generous savior of this backwater shithole, ready to save the helpless local denizens by waving his almighty dollars around"
