He now belongs to history.\n\nChurch bells could be heard ringing across the Reich as the news broke. Adolf Hitler, supreme ruler of the Third Reich, passed away at age 73 in the leadup to his birthday. Previous CIA reports indicated that his health had been failing in recent years, but the crisis of the past years seems to have done him in for good.\n\nIn America, and much of the rest of the world, the mood is in stark contrast to that of Germany. Spontaneous celebrations have broken out In Washington, in New York, in the south, in the west, all across the country. Even in the occupied ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco, American workers and Japanese soldiers agree that Hitler's death is something worth celebration. Publicly, President Nixon has not commented, but privately, he has been reported as 'elated'.\n\nHowever, it does appear that Hitler was the sole thing holding the Reich together. The NSA has intercepted numerous communications from within Germany, indicating that a conflict is imminent.\n\nThere is something more to add.

After his unanimous victory in the 1969 Chess Championship against Bent Larsen of Denmark, he has been considered by many observers as the greatest American grandmaster of all time, and has achieved the highest ELO rating in recorded history. But his brilliancy has not gone without controversy, and the chess community has descended into chaos after he has recently refused to defend his title against Germany.\n\nFollowing his perfect victory in the 1963 US Championship, Fischer has made multiple fascist and pro-German statements, becoming an official member of the extreme right of the National Progressive Party. He has openly described himself as a Yockey, and has made numerous racist statements towards the Japanese and has undergone virulent anti-semitic triades during tournaments, despite him being half-Jewish himself, a label which he passionately rejects. In this year's 1972 Chess Championship, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, he has verbally attacked both the United States and FIDE, culminating in him surrendering the chance for him to play against Klaus Darga of Germany, automatically awarding him the new world champion by default.\n\nHe has answered to the press's questioning with "I refuse to let my name be associated with that of Jewish deceit... I would rather be branded a traitor by you FIDE degenerates than to go against another intellectually superior Aryan of my own blood." It appears as if he will continue to stir discontent if we let him say what he wants to say. What should we do?"

However, upon arrival, he instead entered a government office where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich. After a short internment, the Führer announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and his decision to forfeit from the championship. The rumours of his half-Jewish ancestry seemed to have been overlooked by authorities. He has confirmed to the press that his emigration is permanent, citing recent actions to "silence" him by the American government.\n\nAlthough some are graceful that we will no longer have to deal with that little shit's mouth anymore, the game's community has mourned the loss of our finest player nevertheless. In the Reich, Fischer has been appointed a personal instructor for him to learn Deutsch, and already has current champion Klaus Darga gave him the go-ahead to play with him against the United States in 1975. With no hope in winning FIDE's next competition, this intellectual battlefield, however minor, has been conclusively lost to fascism. What we have sacrificed may have been just a pawn, but every piece matters as the game unfolds..."

Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Bavaria, claiming to have been contested by a local club. However, upon arrival he instead entered a foreign ministry where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich, offering to play for our cause in the future.\n\nUpon being notified of the grandmaster's internment, the Führer has personally announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and appointing him a private instructor for him to learn Deutsch. All those foolish enough to wish to challenge him will now have to do so within our borders. Although there exists rumours that Fischer is half-Jewish himself, we have decided to believe his own claim that he descends from German blood only. In the meantime, Fischer has considered developing his own chess variant for our own people, "Überchess." With Darga agreeing to play with him against the United States in 1975, we are now certain of our dominance over the game's global scene.

If Africa falls, next falls India, then with the east secured, the Nazis will soon be in the Americas as well!\n\nAt least, this is the sentiment that every American general with a foot in the White House door has loudly shouted, berated the Senate over, rallied their troops with and harassed the media with as seemingly every man who has ever held a gun has proclaimed the time for a 'final battle' against the fascist menace.\n\nWhile many members of the Republican-Democrat party have seemed nervous over the situation, proposing some doubts that this 'Domino Theory' is as immediate a threat as proposed, or that entering war with direct servants of the Reich can end in anything besides a greater conflict, it is most surprising that several members of the NPP have stepped across the Senate aisle to agree. Leftists in the NPP have questioned what, exactly, the R-D dominated military establishment proposes as any end goal in this conflict, and what plan they may have to deal with Africa even if there is some sort of victory, while the far right of the party has showed some suspicious hesitance to do battle with the fascists.\n\nRegardless, however, the President seems dead-set on an intervention in the South African conflict, with President Nixon seemingly hoping that a knockout punch on the Reich Commissioners will save his flagging administration and halt the impending impeachment vote."

It seems that our decision to bar all former native cooperators from serving in the new United African army may have backfired. It seems that many of these former native SS members have either joined the ANC, local SS resistance movements or perhaps worst of all, become bandits roving the countryside looting and pillaging as they please.\n\nThe ANC, now exceptionally strengthened and radicalized by the influx of ex-SS members, continues its violent guerilla campaigns against our allies in the region. Worst of all the ANC now enjoys a wide base of support, both from the native African population and whatever is left of the old reichskommissarat forces.\n\nSouth Africa's garrisons have proven ineffective at containing the ANC rebels within their zone of administration. As they are often misled into traps by local African villagers, and despite the harsh reprisals such actions engender they show no signs of stopping. The local regions around South African garrisons are slowly transformed into wastelands patroled by brutal military patrols, for some, it is as the Rechiskommisarats never left.\n\nAs it stands South Africa is slowly taking the place of the old German colonies, both domestically and abroad. Anti-war protests continue, and now focus exclusively on the multitudes of war crimes committed by our supposed allies"

"미국 국민에게 확실한 선택권을 줄 작정입니다. 저는 이제 미국의 철학이 부패와 워싱턴의 폭군을 벌이는 싸움을 환영합니다. 이것들은 우리에게 뭘 하라 말하고, 뭘 생각하라 말하고, 이제는 모든 남녀노소를 집어삼키겠다고 위협하고 있습니다. 저는 미국인들이 충분히 오랫동안 떠밀려 다녔다고, 여러분과 저처럼 이 나라가 개인을 중앙정부에 예속시키는 부패한 바나나 공화국으로 변해가는 것에 질렸다고 믿기 때문에 이 경주에 참가합니다."\n\n윌리스는 남부 주들에서 큰 지지를 받고 있으며, 그들의 삶에서 증가하는 중앙정부의 권력을 경멸하는 보수적인 공동체들에서도 많은 지지를 받고 있으며, 닉슨의 부패하고 더러운 정치를 가능한 한 빨리 역사책에 추방하고 싶어하는 수백만 명 이상의 지지자들이 있습니다. 이것이 11월의 승리로 이어질 수 있을지는 두고 봐야 합니다."

"6명은 모두 한 가지 고통을 공유하고 있었습니다. 그들은 죽은 사람을 부러워합니다"라고 허시는 썼습니다.\n\n불과 2년 전 원자의 공포가 그들에게 드러난 후에도 여전히 휘청거리는 100만 명이 넘는 미국인들이 토요일 아침 잡지를 펼쳐 위로의 풍자와 웃음을 기대했습니다. 그러나 그들이 그 글을 읽으면서 느낀 것은 이제 끊임없이 나아가고 있는 핵 홀로코스트와 독일과 일본을 향한 슬픔과 두려움으로 숨이 막히는 그들의 마음뿐이었습니다.\n\n20년이 지난 지금, 미국은 다시 한번 같은 공포를 찾기 위해 또 다른 특별판 <뉴요커>를 열었고, 이번엔 우리나라의 범죄를 다루고 있습니다. 첫 페이지에 걸쳐 길게 늘어선 사진은 피투성이가 되어 흐르는 강에 흩어져 있는 수백 구의 훼손된 시체들의 항공사진으로, 모두 거대한 스와스티카 모양으로 배치되어 있습니다. 가해자들은 깊은 열대우림의 한 마을을 수색하기 위해 배치된 미군 부대로, 오렌지강을 건너던 중 신원 미상의 전투원들에게 매복당한 것으로 알려졌습니다. 분노에 휩싸인 장교들은 쓰러진 사람들의 시신을 증오의 상징으로 다시 배치하라고 명령했습니다.\n\n윌리엄 웨스트모얼랜드 장군의 개인 수행원은 보수적인 성명에 따르면 이들은 보병 사단을 포획하고 고문하려는 대략 347명의 돌격대원으로 이루어진 것으로 추정됩니다. 그러나 반전 운동가 톰 헤이든의 개인 특파원들은 이 사진이 우연히 죽음의 사단의 야간 순찰 방향으로 걸었던 504명의 비무장 보어 정착민들로 구성되어 있다고 주장합니다. 지금까지 독일 당국에서 온 공식 성명은 전부 모호하고 비열한 모욕으로 구성되었습니다.\n\n기사는 학살이 일어난 지 몇 시간 후인 3월 16일 죄책감에 목을 매 숨진 바나도 심슨 일병의 유서 편지로부터 시작됩니다. 수사는 결국 전쟁범죄의 발각으로 이어졌습니다. 그는 "사망한 아기들과 파내진 동물들로 (스와스티카의) 중심부를 만들었다"고 썼습니다.

Just as he kicks back in his chair to relax after a long day, the phone rings.\n\nHe already knows the caller, and for what reason he calls. The National Assembly of Guyana would soon finish voting on their National Security Act, and William Rogers would be the first to know the results.\n\n"Give it to me straight, Rogers."\n\n"It was a landslide, Dick. Barely more than a quarter voted down."\n\n"They're afraid of Burnham." Nixon muses.\n\n"They should be, now more than ever. He'll crack down on anyone who threatens the peace. Political rivals, anti-segregationists; anybody and everybody." Rogers declares.\n\n"Why'd we put that bastard in power, anyways?

The Guyanese President, Forbes Burnham, has stated that the raids 'strengthened the Guyanan Republic, and its democratic system'. Exiled former President Cheddi Jagan issued a statement..."\n\nA couple dozen people crowd the room. Aides, secretaries, and even a few senators, all sitting in pure silence as the low hum of the television and its tinny speakers recite the unfortunate news. Rogers sighs, deciding he has heard enough. Standing up, he shuffles over to the TV and turns it off. He turns around and looks at the two dozen-or-so people crowded into the sitting room, their expectant eyes locked upon him, their ears awaiting his word.

So far, no one has said a word, aside from a few curt greetings. H.R. Haldeman breaks the palpable silence, "I think we all know why we're here. Our friend in Guyana has gone too far, we need to do something about it."\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, follows Haldeman's lead and speaks next, Nixon still bearing an angry yet contemplative look. "The press doesn't know our involvement in his election. We need to threaten constricting economic ties. Sanctions, condemnations, and diplomatic isola-"\n\n"-frankly, Bob, he'll get trade from somewhere else. Hell, when Germany gets back on its feet we'll all be in trouble because that's where he'll get it from. The Krauts would jump at the chance for an ally right on our doorstep," Kennedy cuts in, his sharp Massachusetts accent grabbing the attention of the room.\n\n"What do you suggest?" McNamara asks.\n\n"Use our clout in the country. Threats, bribes, and blackmail."\n\nMcNamara shakes his head, "No, just apply pressure for him to repeal the act! If we threaten him, he'll double down on his opposition. Any MP of theirs he suspects might turn against him will face retribution. We can't top that, if only for moral reasons."\n\nSlowly the room evolves into conflicting arguments, various cabinet members arguing for an exile army, others for isolation. Suddenly, a voice cuts through the clamor. "That's enough!"\n\nThe head of the table has spoken. Richard Nixon stands, and then speaks, "I don't care about it either way, I just want the press and Burnham, both, to calm the hell down! Force him, pressure him, it doesn't matter.

Unlike yesterday, the Presidential Cabinet is not assembled in its near-entirety. Only McNamara, Haldeman, Nixon, and Kennedy are in the boardroom.\n\n"Well," McNamara says, "I guess we've got to do it the hard way. Ball's in your court, Jack."\n\n"I'll make the call."\n\nKennedy makes the move to get up, but Nixon raises a hand. Turning around, he scans his eyes over the room, "Who says we have to do anything?"\n\nHaldeman raises an eyebrow, "Dick, he's executing people, we can't let this slide, not with the press on our backs like they are now."\n\n"Since when are we so high and mighty? We've supported men like Burnham in the past, and even if we ignore this, we still have plausible deniability."\n\n"I don't think this is a good idea," Kennedy says, placing a hand on Nixon's shoulder, "I think we owe it to the people of Guyana to help them."\n\nHaldeman looks over to McNamara, who shrugs, "Gotta tell you Bob, I agree with Dick on this one."\n\nHaldeman looks at Nixon, "Well Dick, you're the president.""

As he finished reciting the oath of office, he surveyed the assembled crowd and saw a people uplifted from their sorrows. The sight alone was more than enough a reward for his work, but he knew that he still had more to do.\n\n"It is often said that a chain is only so strong as its weakest link. So too is a nation only so great as its humblest man. When he and his kindred are stricken, and the nation does not rise to the task of uplifting him, it has effectively split itself in two. It is split between a loud nation of opulence and splendor, and a silent nation of want. For a nation to be great, it must not allow this fractured silence. Four years ago I stood before you and vowed to never allow this silence again, and now you the people stand before me, and you are no longer silent...\n\n...but it is not sufficient for the nation to plaster over the gaps. The cracks must truly be healed, and the inequalities of the nation truly addressed before the spectre can finally be slain. Let us go forth in the interests of the land, and of the people. Let us work to once and for all end want and misery in this country. Let us strive to fulfil the true potential of this nation and allow all to enjoy its bounty. America shall be truly one and indivisible, and never again shall we allow an invisible and impoverished world exist right beneath our noses!"\n\nWild applause greeted his closing remarks. President Harrington smiled, but he knew that words alone could not move a nation. Four years had been spent doing precisely what he had warned against, his efforts a mere bandage over the wound of want. Now he had four more years, and he had to make them count. Poverty's grip over the other America had been weakened - now was the time to cut it loose forever."

In Washington D.C. over $15 million in property damage has been accounted for, but order has largely been restored. Baltimore, where citizen's anger may have burned the hottest, has concluded its extraordinary use of heavily armed federal troops.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out over President Nixon's use of the veto against civil rights legislation are slowly starting to die down, as a combination of apathy and repression slows their inertia. As the dust settles, historians and political scientists are examining the possibility that this outpouring of discontent marks the greatest social upheaval since the Civil War. Even as the violence on the street is decreasing rhetorical violence is increasing.\n\nMany Civil Rights moderates are outraged, but are afraid of being tied to the riots by future electoral opponents. A broader swath of opposition, from liberal Republicans to the NPP-Left, are decrying Nixon as the tyrant envisioned by the Founders. An open letter signed by a bevy of top academics castigated the Republican party for falling in with segregationists and cast the veto as the ugly vow of the unholy union between R and D. All signatories promised to leave the party and encourage others to do so as well. It's clear that the veto of the Civil Rights Act has hardened its proponents, and divided the country even further.

 USA.1803.desc:0 "In 1877, US Congressmen reached a compromise that resolved the disputed Presidential election of 1876 by giving the Presidency to Rutherford B. Hayes in return for ending Reconstruction and permitting the establishment of Jim Crow laws. Almost a century later, these laws stand unchanged across much of the South. Few thought the seventies would be a decade where the Allman Brothers Band were banned from performing in their home state, where the Negro Motorist Green Book would surpass 40 years of publication, and where men and women of separate races still face criminal prosecution for falling in love. Yet, thanks to decades of federal ambivalence to this injustice, and failure to pass a lasting Civil Rights Act, have allowed our nation's greatest shame to endure.\n\nBlack America's fury at their continued oppression has reached a boiling point. With Reverend King and his principles of nonviolent resistance being dead for almost a decade, many Blacks have turned to violence, organized or disorganized, as the only viable form of resistance. Segregated department stores hire armed guards to protect against vandalism, and Southern police have become increasingly militarized in order to quash the near-monthly riots in Black neighborhoods. In reaction, Southern Whites have been flocking to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist militias in order to brutalize Blacks who protest injustice. The Left-NPP declares themselves the only political force who truly fights for racial justice, Yockey claims to be the one man who can save White America from lawlessness, and many take their word for it.\n\nIf America does not make any progress on this crisis, it will only further deteriorate. We may just be forced to choose between the survival of segregation, or of our nation."

 USA.1901.desc:0 "Like all organised crime establishments the anonymous room in Queens had the smell of cash, and cigarettes, and too many secrets whispered into waiting drywall. The men within paced about and spoke at length on the subjects one would expect; a laundering here, a fiefdom issue there, the latest quotas from the bosses. Everybody knew enough to make sure they didn't leave the wrong words hanging in the air for the wrong ears: shibboleths sprouted in the smoky mist. The Genovese branch of the Mafia hadn't clung to their yellowed halls of power on the East Coast by playing stupid. They certainly weren't going to start now.\n\nThe struggle at present wasn't one of power, but of its old friend, money. The New York joints had been busted up for a long while, and for a time the patrons had settled for what they could get. Depression years and the chaos of the Fifties had a way of killing any uptown pretensions. But now that America was recovering the old middle-class patrons were beginning to filter out, and ones even the Cosa Nostra deemed distasteful were moving in to take their place. The pimps were losing control of the situation on home turf. Something had to be done.\n\nAntony, Joe and Mark (not their real names) fiddled with the map of South Avenue on the table. A new joint, free of the putrid smell of the Old Town, would jazz up the revenues and act as a movement point for money, guns, information. Old trades, new venue, easy money. But who would frequent it? It wasn't exactly Broadway.\n\nAntony smiled. His next words would change history, even if he didn't actually know it yet."

Left and left and right and left again, a swirl of the body so sweeping it belongs on the parade square, not the rough tiles of the inn floor. Then the shoes opposite him trace the contours in lithe slips and end up in their original placing (by some arcane coincidence).\n\nMartin glares at him with visible annoyance. John looks down in sheepishness. The moment stretches taut, pulls apart and snaps. Martin bursts out laughing, tickled by something on John's face, and pulls him to himself. His face smells of smoke and aftershave.\n\nThe kiss is tart and startling in the dim neon. John pulls back with the old instincts of the Brooklyn boy who always knew how much of himself to show, and how much to hide. But today a part of him resists, and instead he stays. It's a raw comfort, and in the glittering sharpness of the moment it's all he has.\n\nMartin pulls away with some reluctance. The date has been brief, and even this hour has been snatched at great cost. They haven't much time. He takes John's arm and together they spin out of the little bar, their little dance studio. Their figures are quickly lost in the chaos and brilliance of the New York night, blending in neon-shaded phantoms before disappearing."

 USA.1903.desc:0 "It's a quiet night in the Stonewall Inn. Barely anyone notices my scribbling notes in the corner; this corner of America is obscure, but it shares the tendency for aching introspection, abbreviated loneliness hammered out via cheap glass cups. Beyond the occasional whisper and the wordless glances, not much makes it out of the haze of anonymity, and long may it remain so - the haze is the only thing that separates this part of town from the moralizing glaze of the rest of America. It's the only thing that keeps it safe.\n\nAs I'm writing this, a pair of young men (in their twenties, perhaps?), one Latino, one Caucasian, are swerving to the aching beat of "Satisfaction". Their patterned shoes tap out a rhythm at once familiar and strange; just irregular enough to inject vitality while keeping pace with the beat. Their bodies trace patterns so bold they'd be scandalous anywhere else, but here in the trace of lips and hands on waists it achieves careworn familiarity, like an elderly seamstress fixing an old cardigan. If this had been a different country perhaps they would have become dancers. But the lipstick and the gaudy dresses they wear would kill their careers, and a lot more besides, in this one. America is home to the brave, but this land isn't free, not for some. Not yet.\n\nFor now there is the freedom of the swirl and curve of dance, the celebration of the joy of life in a world with so little else. Another man offers his hand, and I rise to dance. In the gentle rhythm and the smoky swirls I sense some vast and gentle ecstasy, and with every sway I come closer to its source."

 USA.1904.t:0 "The Warning"
 USA.1904.desc:0 "The Stonewall Inn is a spot of light and loud laughter in a world slipping into autumn. The sounds of occasional retching aside, the Inn is a good place, and the crowds know it to be far more than just a building. For many of its patrons it's the only place they can truly be themselves. But autumn is sweeping in, one chill breeze at a time.\n\nThe signs have been there for a long while; the Mayor's riding on the coattails of the Moral Cleanup movement sweeping the country, and the officers sent to do the collection duties (one calls it the offering bag, with only a hint of irony) from the Inn tell the bartenders of the Anti-Mafia Team they're forming in the back of the Metropolitan Department. It's not like the community they've formed here hasn't known the wrath of the cops, but this time it'll be different. Change is coming to America, as the President says over the airwaves, but some changes are less welcome than others.\n\nThe bartender methodically cleans his cups half an hour before closing time: he'll take care of the mess in the toilets afterwards (and there is always a mess in the toilets). He got hired by the Don same as all the staff, but he's come to love the place. The patrons are gaudy and have a glint in their eyes, but it's a real life they're living here in the damp spaces.\n\nHe looks at a sleeping customer hunched over his cups and smiles wanly. Whatever happens next, he'll stay with the ship, even if the hull's leaking. His passengers deserve nothing less."

The four undercover officers curse as they fiddle with the switches, and the lights flicker back to life. The few who realise what is about to happen begin pushing their way through the crowd, but the Morals Squad have already locked down the window exits and are marching through the doors, flashlights in hand, as they bust the biggest gay establishment in New York.\n\nThe raid doesn't meet with a receptive crowd, to say the least: As officers lead those in women's clothing to the toilets many resist. It's common knowledge that those who get arrested by the Morals Squad as cross-dressing men don't make it out without bruises, spit-drenched faces, manhandling. Men with faces lean and caked with makeup wrestle with their cuffs and spit on their captors. None of the bar's patrons have made it this far in a world which mostly despises them without getting a little rough around the edges, and when the Man pushes them around they push right back.\n\nBy the time the raid concludes about 150 people are under arrest. But more are gathering in the late-night darkness of the Big Apple, and a storm is brewing that cannot be contained."

 USA.1906.desc:0 "The greatest LGBT riot in the history of the United States begins with a logistics problem. The Morals Police have grabbed 28 cases of beer and 19 kegs of hard liquor, but with the patrol vans occupied elsewhere they have nowhere to put it. Instead they keep the patrons on lockdown as the wagons arrive, far too slowly for a police operation. The patrons, of course, are understandably upset, and those few not under arrest quickly join the growing crowds gathered outside the building. Many of them know that once the Inn dies, so too does the living, breathing heart of gay culture in the Greatest City in the World. They have everything to lose.\n\nAs Mafia members and patrons are loaded onto the wagons, many still struggling, a lone voice breaks out. 'We Shall Overcome', a protest song written for the South African War, finds receptive ears in another angry crowd facing another unwinnable fight. Growing cheers, growling, shouts of "Gay Power!" echo from the crowds, which have swelled to bursting in the street. Stormé Delarverie falls to the floor struggling against four officers, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nRecords are unclear what exactly happens next: in a wave of anger, the mob pushes over police wagons, hurls bricks at the officers retreating into Stonewall, presses garbage against the broken windows. Many of the most repressed members of the gay community lead the riot - the drag queens and the street boys, leading a wild, wild charge. Sylvia Rivera, notable drag queen, will remember it as "the greatest night of her life". The doors of the Inn are broken open with a battering ram. Officers inside prepare for a fiery last stand.\n\nAnd then the police trucks arrive."

 USA.1907.desc:0 "The initial reaction is one of rage. Officers bloody and coated with garbage, an inn wrecked with violence - and the fairies did it. The fairies. Violence explodes on the streets as police officers take the law into their own hands, and hammer their rage onto the defenceless. The mob arrayed against them is far too far gone to care. They form the rough outline of a cabaret chorus line and begin to sing. Their voices are piercing in the late night, and the police have had enough of being needled - they rush the line.\n\nMen and women get hammered with nightsticks as bedlam spreads to the surrounding streets. Crowds run around police officers, laughing gaily like warriors in the light of burning cars. By the time the riots come to a halt, Christopher Street is blocked, half the cars on it are overturned and every garbage can for a mile around has been emptied into the street. Witnesses describe an odd beauty to the refuse-strewn street, like a river of broken toys.\n\nOf course, the streets aren't the only thing breaking the news: all through the next day crowds gawk at the burnt-out shell of Stonewall, and when the next night comes the they are joined by songwriters, poets, activists and tourists washing down the streets in a tide of exuberant energy. Allen Ginsberg notes, on the way back, that "the guys there were so beautiful-they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago.""

Though we could not stage direct attacks in the Home Islands nor in China, we have pinpointed various locations where we can start breaking down the Sphere from within. Let's begin with a nation that many of our great-grandfathers are familiar with.\n\nThe Philippines. These islands were the spoils of our victory over the Spanish Empire in 1898, and they stayed with us until the Second World War saw them forcefully ripped away from our influence. The Japanese preyed on the inhabitants ever since, spawning dozens of pro-democratic rebel groups that we could lend aid to. Their close proximity to the Japanese island may prove to be useful if we can get the Filipinos on our side.\n\nVietnam. The Vietnamese have been oppressed since the dawn of French colonialism, and the handing over of Vietnam to Japan only made matters worse for the natives. This could be our opportunity to introduce democracy and let Vietnam be ruled by Vietnamese for the first time in centuries. Vietnam could also be a gateway to India or even China itself if we succeed.\n\nIndonesia. These islands provide a large bulk of the Sphere's resources, mainly oil, rubber, and a hefty worker population. If we operate in Indonesia and persuade them to rebel against their Japanese overlords, the economy of the Sphere would suffer incredible damage. There would be shortages across East Asia, and it may cause other members of the Sphere to renounce their membership, further pressuring the Empire of Japan."

Marshall, a graduate of Howard Law School and an experienced civil rights litigator, would be the first African-American to serve on the highest court in the land. His appointment would surely mark a turning point in American history. However, some in Congress are not so willing to see such a point turn in the first place.\n\nMany Senators come from the South, and are directly reliant on white voter blocs who aren't well-disposed towards putting a black man on the Supreme Court. Several members of the Senate have already put out statements to the press expressing their firm opposition, although nobody has come out and said that it would be due to Marshall's race. Instead, the releases mentioned the dangers of "liberal judicial activism", and other such phrases. Clearly, the appointment of Thurgood Marshall will be a political fight for the ages."

Justice Marshall will be the first African-American to serve on the court, and his confirmation is undoubtedly a victory for the Civil Rights Movement, which he himself has worked tirelessly to advance.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, a number of conservative senators railed against "judicial activism", and made a variety of statements that many commentators have called little better than dog whistles. Some even asked whether or not Marshall had ties to "American Bolsheviks". This strategy failed, however. At a press conference today, Justice Marshall stated his gratitude to the Senate, and to the people of America, before posing for pictures with his two sons and his wife, the civil rights activist Cecilia Suyat Marshall.\n\nThis is a truly historic moment for the nation, representing the triumph of justice over institutional racism!"
 USA_sen_bill.105_fail:0 "Following the nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, one southern senator was reported to have claimed:\n\n"We will fight this nomination all the way—until hell freezes over, and then we'll skate across on the ice."\n\nIt would appear that, as of today, that fight had succeeded. Two weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to have Marshall's nomination proceed to the Senate floor, but with the recommendation that it be rejected. This was seen by many as a death knell for the appointment, but still, our whips persisted in trying to gather the necessary votes. They failed. In a tight vote, the Senate rejected Marshall's nomination, led by a large bloc of reactionary southerners.\n\nAs observers sat stunned by the rejection of the man who would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, some in the White House were already drafting plans for a response. The next name on the shortlist is the fairly conservative Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Let's hope that he makes it."

Despite the white public’s division on this Act, minorities hail this Act as exactly the kind of radical proposal needed to end American racism once and for all."
 USA_civil_rights_6:0 "혁명적인 민권법"
 USA_civil_rights_6_desc:0 "The new Civil Rights Act has crossed the Rubicon in terms of its scope. Along with total de jure racial, linguistic, religious and gender equality in all sectors of society, the Act now includes a strict Affirmative Action scheme. Colleges, businesses, and even government bodies must now meet minimum diversity quotas or face severe legal penalties. The Attorney General has almost limitless power to enforce this Act, and massive desegregation of both Northern and Southern society is already under way.\n\nMany White Americans see this act as a bridge too far, an extremist policy that arbitrarily disenfranchises Whites to promote minorities. Even some in the Black community are reserved about this act, believing that its authors have put the community in jeopardy by pushing too far, too fast.\n\nOne group has certainly benefited from this act: The §rYockeys§!. Their leader has decried the Act as a malicious attack on the nation’s Culture that is the first subjugate in subjugating White Americans to a Culture-distorting New World Order. Though still a fringe group, the passage of this Act has galvanized their support base and reports suggest that many new followers have joined their ranks. Hopefully, this is just a temporary backlash before White America relaxes and accepts a truly equal society.\n\n§xHopefully.§!"

It had brought to life a coalition of democracies - a monument to the resolve of ideals and the free men who champion them.\n\nBut the world was unkind to this promise, and so lashed it with setback after betrayal until its allies, its enemies, and eventually its own heralds heeded its words no longer.\n\nAll that remains of it is a bitter memory of what once was, of what could have been... and of what now will never be."

#Leaders

 POLITICS_RFK_DESC:0 "Robert Francis Kennedy certainly didn't grow up in an impoverished family. Part of the Kennedy dynasty of businessmen and politicians, his childhood was a privileged one. He grew up in suburban Massachusetts, one of nine children in a profoundly American family, and was raised to appreciate their Irish and Catholic heritage. Living through the Great Depression for most of his childhood, he witnessed his countrymen face impoverishment as they never had before.\n\nGoing on to attend Catholic schools across New England, Kennedy decided to serve in the Navy after the tragic death of his brother Joseph Kennedy in 1943. Kennedy would serve his country in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, with his relatively short service in the armed forces having a profound influence on his life, and his decision to enter politics.\n\nFollowing an honorable discharge, RFK entered journalism school, particularly interested in welfare and social programs designed to help the unfortunate. He was in attendance at the peace conference between the United States and Japan, and after the war visited Sweden to write about their extensive welfare programs. When his brother, John F. Kennedy, emerged as the running mate to Richard Nixon, Robert quickly proved his political acumen, to the extent that his brother would say that "If I need something done and done quick, I go to Bobby."\n\nTragedy would strike soon after. JFK's assassination not only broke Robert's heart - the death of his beloved brother severed any remaining ties to the R-Ds, whose President had vetoed the Civil Rights Act. Disillusioned with partisan politics, RFK decided to join the National Progressive Party, determined to make the American dream possible for all of his countrymen, and was promptly pushed to run for the Presidency. Swept into office in 1964, Robert became one of a rare breed. He became the champion of an American idealism seen in few others, someone who believed in hope in a world which possessed very little."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "In many ways Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to by his initials LBJ, is living proof that the American dream still lives. Born in a Texas farmhouse and raised in humble conditions, far from the glitz and glamour that America's elite grew up in, Johnson has not forgotten the lessons of his modest upbringing. Though he spent several years teaching impoverished children in Texas, he quickly found his calling in politics. With a natural talent for aggressive persuasion and dealmaking that would soon be widely known in Washington as the "Johnson Treatment", he began first as a congressional aide before quickly ascending to the House of Representatives, then the Senate. There he reigned as Majority Leader of the Republican and then Republican-Democrat party for a decade. Now he has finally climbed as high as any American can, and has been elected the President of the United States. LBJ has promised to heal the wounds that have been festering in America for decades, and is determined to tackle the issues of racial and economic inequality once and for all. Johnson envisions an American society where every man has equal rights and equal opportunity to succeed. However, with Germany descending further into chaos by the day, and Japan fighting to maintain and expand its sphere, Johnson may not be able to focus exclusively on the home front, as events beyond his control threaten to pull America back onto the global battlefield once more."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "Richard Milhous Nixon is a complicated figure. Originally a Representative, and then Senator from California, he rapidly rose through the ranks of Congress through skilled political manouvering. During his time as a Senator, Nixon worked closely with Joe McCarthy in carrying out the Grey Scare, working to root out suspected fascists in government. And while he didn't share the spotlight to the same extent as McCarthy did, nobody doubts that Nixon is still an anti-fascist crusader through and through.\n\nA lifelong member of the Republican Party, Nixon has never been totally comfortable working alongside the Democrats. The broad popularity of the National Progressive Party dictates that they must, however, and the coalition ticket that won him the 1960 election has made his presidency a living hell. John F. Kennedy's position as the Vice President has driven a wedge in the Executive Branch, as his own magnetic charisma and stunning competence have taken the spotlight away from Nixon more than once.\n\nAs much as Nixon wants to focus on foreign policy, so he can act to undermine the unstable German and Japanese empires, domestic affairs have gotten in the way. Civil rights issues can no longer be ignored, as racial tensions flare and people demand action, one way or another. While Nixon has been reluctant to endorse either segregation or integration, staying on the fence is becoming increasingly costly.\n\nOf course, Nixon is also doing what he can to keep the NPP down, including some... extralegal means. With challengers coming at him from all sides, including within the White House, Nixon will have a hell of a time trying to keep the ship of state steady."
 POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "존 피츠제럴드 케네디가 정치적 명성을 얻기까지의 길은 다른 많은 사람들의 논란으로 가려져 왔었습니다. 강력한 케네디 가문의 자손이자 조지프 케네디 대통령의 아들인 그는 형 조지프 케네디의 죽음 이후 태평양 전선에서 불려져와 그 이후 계속 그의 아버지의 길을 밟도록 길러져 왔습니다. 1948년 대선과 민주당의 공중분해 이후, 존의 동생 로버트 케네디를 제외한 케네디 가문은 민주당의 잔여 세력과 함께 공화당으로 향하면서 공화민주당의 일원이 되었습니다. 몇몇은 존 F. 케네디의 경력이 그의 아버지의 실패로 더럽혀질 것이라고 예상하였으나, 존의 개인적 카리스마와 적응력은 그를 아버지의 그림자에서 벗어나오게 하였습니다. 1960년 케네디는 공화민주당의 부통령 경선에서 승리하였습니다. 불행히도, 그의 러닝메이트는 리처드 닉슨이었습니다.\n\n이제 존은 혼란에 빠진 국가의 선장이 되었습니다. 이 국가는 그의 지도를 간절히 기대하고 있습니다. 하지만 많은 미국인들이 그를 안정의 상징으로 보는 한편, 그를 장애물로 보는 사람들도 있습니다. 인종분리주의를 열렬히 찬성하는 자들은 그의 이상주의가 민권법안의 입법을 더욱 진행시키리라 여기고, 골수 진보주의자들은 그가 동생 로버트처럼 열정적이지 않다고 비난합니다. 운명은 존 F. 케네디가 국가를 선도하도록 명하였으나, 국가를 위험한 수역에서 벗어나게 할 사람이 정말 그일까요?"
 POLITICS_GEORGE_WALLACE_DESC:0 "George C. Wallace portrays himself a both an honorable Southern gentleman and a true red-blooded American, being the only one willing to protect his proud country from the Japanazi menace while preserving the rights and liberties his people hold dear. In reality he is an opportunist par excellence, willing to mold his ideology as he sees fit in order to maximize the possible turnout at the polls. Seeking to court the fine white voters as governor in his native Alabama, this inevitably manifested itself as a staunch segregationist platform, defending it on all fronts from un-American fifth columnists seeking to undermine states' rights. As the Democratic Party imploded in 1948 and the "Solid South's" party loyalty wavered, Wallace eagerly jumped ship to Richard Russell Jr.'s fledgling States' Rights Party, then to the Patriotic Party, then finally to the National Progressive Party.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Wallace successfully moderated his position just enough to win the support of the NPP's Frankensteinian voter base, and eventually the majority of the nation. Now that he finally sits in the White House, his alliance of convenience with many of the NPP's more left-leaning members is rapidly wearing thin - how do you hold together a party bound only by hatred of the establishment if you are the establishment? But Wallace likely doesn't plan for the alliance to last much longer. Rather, it seems he'll be using his time to legally buttress segregation as much as he can. When it is effectively impossible to dislodge, he will return home, where he shall be forever immortalized as the savior of the South."
 POLITICS_MARGARET_CHASE_SMITH_DESC:0 "마가렛 체이스 스미스는 그녀의 일생 전체가 역사의 시발점이었습니다. 연방하원의원과 연방상원의원을 모두 역임한 첫 여성이며, 상원 국방위원회에 재직한 첫 여성이기도 하고, 대통령직에 도전하고, 승리한 첫 여성이기도 했습니다. 이 모든 과정에서 그녀의 반대자들은 그녀가 내성적으로 직을 수행하기에는 부적절하다고 주장해왔으나, 워싱턴에서 20년이 넘는 의원 생활 동안 냉철하고 원칙있는 매파로서의 명성을 구축한 스미스 대통령은 이들이 틀렸다는 것을 매번 증명해오고 있습니다.\n\n그녀의 몇 안되는 동지들에게 스미스 대통령은 분열된 국가진보당의 한결같은 기둥과 같습니다. 그녀의 많은 경쟁자들과 정적들에게 스미스 대통령은 짜증나는 인습타파주의자입니다. 그녀는 조 매카시의 회색분자 사냥을 시민 자유의 침해를 들어 '미국적이지 않다'고 비난함으로써 상원의 공화당 동료 의원들을 놀라게 했고, 진주만의 핵공격 이후 일본에 핵보복을 했을 것이라는 언급으로 일본이 그녀를 '여자의 탈을 쓴 짐승'이라고 맹비난하기도 했었습니다. 그녀는 1951년 공화민주당의 합당 이후 미국의 항복을 설계한 자들과의 협업을 거부하며 당을 탈당하였고, 이후 국가진보당 극우파의 인종분리주의자들과는 합석을 거부하고 국가진보당 중도파나 전 공화당 동료 의원들이 파시스트들의 위협에서 관심이 멀어지는 듯 하면 그들을 꾸짖기도 하면서 국가진보당의 나머지 인원들과도 불편한 관계를 맺어 왔습니다.\n\n스미스는 미국이 파시스트들과의 싸움에 뛰어들고 이겨야만 한다고 생각하며, 그 과정에서 악마에게 영혼을 팔고자 하지도 않습니다. 이제 국가진보당이, 공화민주당의 비겁함을 강조하면서도 인종분리주의자들은 저 멀리 내쳐버리면 좋겠습니다만,  그녀 아래 집결한 이상 스미스 대통령은 미국의 다른 사람들에게 외국의 폭정들과의 싸움은 아직 끝나지 않았다고 설득하는 엄중한 임무와 함께 국가진보당의 최악의 극단분자들을 무력화시키는 일까지 떠앉았습니다. 이는 스미스 대통령에게 있어 가장 힘든 도전이지만, 이는 겨우 시작일 뿐입니다."

 POLITICS_JOHN_MCCORMACK_DESC:0 "대부분의 대통령들에게 그들의 취임식은 수 년간의 정치적 야망과 성공을 합쳐 이들을 지구상 가장 높은 공직에 두는 한편 궁극적으로는 국가를 그들의 이상에 맞추는 것입니다. 전 하원의장 존 맥코맥에겐 그런 사치가 허용되지 않았습니다. 혼란과 유혈이 낭자한 날 의회에서 끌려나와 백악관으로 향하게 된 그는 혼란에 빠진 국가를 마주하고 있습니다. 민권법에 대한 닉슨 대통령의 행동이 불러온 분노가 의회에서는 어떠한 예의도 찾아볼 수 없게 하였고, 입법보다는 고성이 오가는 논쟁이 더 많은 시간을 차지하게 되었습니다. 사람들 또한 목소리를 높였고, 매주 폭동과 시위가 발생하고 있고 유권자들은 국가진보당의 극단주의자들에게 지지를 돌리고 있습니다.\n\n맥코맥은 백악관에 스스로를 고립시키고, 믿을 수 있는 참모진과 친구들과만 국가중대사를 논하며 미국이 향하고 있는 혼란스러운 파도를 잠재우는 역할은 다른 대리인들에게만 맡기고 있습니다. 위기에 빠진 당, 인종분리주의라는 분열적인 문제 그리고 급속히 격렬해지고 있는 남아프리카 전쟁이라는 문제와 마주한 주저하는 대통령의 다음 임기 며칠은 미국의 다음 수 년을 좌우하게 될 것입니다."

USA_sen_bill_name_6:0 "The Federal Student Aid Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "Education has been a local issue since the beginning of America, with local school districts maintaining schools and the states providing some direction. However, this has meant that there are wide disparities based on wealth and state mandates, meaning that many students are not receiving the full education they need for the future. The Federal Student Aid Act will fix this, by providing resources to states and districts that desperately need it, and a baseline standard of education across the US."
bill_6_passed:0 "President Robert Kennedy, surrounded by the students and teachers at Strong John Thomson Elementary School in Washington DC just a few blocks from the White House, is signing the Federal Student Aid Act to applause as news cameras and photographers record the event for posterity.\n\n"Today, we say that all of America's students deserve the chance to learn and grow, to become the well-informed, smart and intelligent adults of tomorrow that will make America better than ever. The doctors, teachers, artists, inventors and leaders of tomorrow are in our schools today, and we must do all we can today, to make tomorrow even better."\n\nThe FSA Act will set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government will provide money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the new standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile education groups and civil rights organizations are really pleased with the FSA in their equality and standardization edicts, many state's rights proponents are angry at the law, which is pretty much stripping the local control over education that has long been one of the most important roles of the states. While most of the articles of the law are only for those school districts that require the funds and are "opt-in," the need for money in many of the poorest states will force them to compromise on their beliefs in order to get the money they need to operate. Nevertheless, the FSA will soon make America one of the best educated nations in the world."
bill_6_failed:0 "In a shocking announcement, the Federal Student Aid Act has failed to clear the Senate. Overseeing the vote, Vice President Hubert Humphrey has announced that the act has failed to acquire enough votes, leading to a major blow to his and President Kennedy's effort at school reform.\n\n"The failure of this effort to reform America's schools will reverberate throughout the years," Bobby Kennedy angrily thundered during a press conference. "The next George Washington Carver will never get the chance to see their full potential. The next Ernest Hemmingway will be stuck in poverty. The next Thomas Edison will never get to change the world."\n\nThe FSA Act would have set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government would have provided money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the now tabled law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile state's rights supporters cheer the failure of the "draconian" and "tyrannical" efforts to level the playing field for education across America, Civil Rights groups and education unions decry the failure of the law and the many inequalities that will persist for the indefinite future."

RD_R_compromise_desc_6:0 "Senator Scoop Jackson has been meeting with multiple Republican senators throughout the sprawling Senate Office Buildings, most of them individually in the attempt to get enough votes to pass the Federal Student Aid Act.\n\nIn fact, Scoop has been surprised about how receptive to the idea of additional education funding is with his colleagues from the other side of the aisle. After all, there is nothing more popular with a politician seeking re-election than to point to a new school in their district, or the improved test scores, to show that, yes, they are doing their job.\n\nBut, like usual, there are some concerns with the law as it has been written. For one thing, some Senators have expressed concern about how the federal mandates will strip the states of their prerogatives to manage education, which would be incredibly unpopular in some states, especially in the south and west. Other senators were a bit uneasy on the cost of the FSA, which will tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to the budget. While, again, they like the idea of supporting education, they also don't want to saddle those same children with even more debt when they become taxpayers.\n\nHaving taken their words into account, Scoop has approached the committee writing the bill, and made his suggestion:"

USA_sen_bill_name_7:0 "The Affordable Housing Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "The American dream is centered around one thing: owning your own home. But since the end of the war, real-estate developers have been more focused on developing middle-class suburbia: thousands of cookie-cutter homes on twisting cul-de-sacs far from the centers of the big cities. This has left millions, especially racial minorities, squeezed out of the housing market. The Affordable Housing Act will solve this issue, and build many new homes and the amenities to make new communities."
bill_7_passed:0 "As the signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office to the flash of photographers' light bulbs, an assortment of real estate developers, civil rights leaders and mayors from cities big and small across America applauded as President Robert Kennedy signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.\n\n"I'm pleased to sign this bill into law, which will make it easier to build affordable, liveable, and safe housing for those Americans that could only dream before of home ownership," the President said moments before he signed the law. "Today, we say that every family in the United States has the right to own their own home."\n\nThe new law will allow cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill will also provide subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and help establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city. These new homes would not be apartment blocks like some opponents had suggested, but duplexes, townhouses, row houses and other such buildings to allow more people access to housing that the larger, car focused suburban dwellings that are too expensive, or even forbidden, for racial minorities to access: government funding is only provided on the condition that no barriers will be put in place for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or anyone else.\n\nAlready, there are many plans being drawn up for the "Kennedyburgs" in every city in the nation, redeveloping areas that had overlooked and abandoned for years, promising a new construction boom that will last for a decade or more."
bill_7_failed:0 "The votes are in, and the Senate has rejected the Affordable Housing Act, one of the key planks of President Robert Kennedy's agenda. Complaints about the cost, the dictates on how the money would be spent, and even lingering segregationist elements in Congress scuttled the law that would have revitalized major cities, opening up housing development for minorities and working class families, and created a whole new chorot of property owners.\n\n"The President is disappointed at the Senate's rejection of the Affordable Housing Act," a spokesman for the White House said in a press conference. "Nevertheless, the fight to expand home ownership and give all Americans, not just the wealthy and middle class, the chance to buy their own house will go on."\n\nThe defeated law would have allowed cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them.

It's a great way to see who is an introvert, who's an extrovert, and even how the nitty-gritty details of politics can get done.\n\nIn the haze of cigarette smoke and the smell of the meals served hot by some of the best chefs in Washington, "Scoop" Jackson was sitting with some of his Republican colleagues, enjoying their mid-afternoon break.\n\n"So, about the housing bill," one of the Republican Senators said, cutting into a chicken breast. "I can tell that you are here to get that passed, right?"\n\n"Well, if you want to get to business," the Senate Leader of the C-NPP replied. "But you know it will help your communities greatly, make a lot of new homeowners, taxpayers, and all that shit that will make your cities and states happy indeed. And it won't be just Chicago or Seattle or Miami that gets the money. Every city and town in the country can apply for it."\n\n"It's going to cost a lot though," another senator said. "Not sure if my constituents will appreciate having to foot the bill."\n\n"It will pay for itself in time," Jackson replied, as he took a drink of water. "Besides, if you give a man a home, go and cut the ribbon when they open it up, I'm sure lots of folks will support you in your next term." Jackson set his glass on his tray, and stood up, preparing to hand off his dirty dishes and return to work. "You can't get better publicity than that.""

Regulations mandating that full-time workers be given an eight hour work day, or at least generous overtime pay is another large component of the NLRA. Penalties will be put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as "part-time", a "contractor" or "freelance", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects is the establishment of a federal minimum wage: $1.50 for full-time employees in most industries, with agriculture and a handful of service industries allowed to set a slightly smaller minimum wage to a minimum of $1.10. But this minimum wage would be re-evaluated every year based on inflation, to maintain the purchasing power.\n\n"The only way to maintain a strong economy and a strong democracy is to give everyone in the nation the ability to make a living," President Kennedy said as he signed the law.

One of the most important aspects of the now dead bill was the establishment of a Federal Pension System. A small percentage of an employee's paycheck would have been withheld, and paid into the FPS. This money would then be put into safe investments such as government bonds to continuously grow the pot. When retiring at a minimum age of 65, or when a worker is severely injured and unable to continue working, a liveable pension would have then been paid to them for the rest of their lives, annually adjusted for inflation.\n\n"The President is incredibly disappointed in the failure of the NRLA," a brief statement issued by the White House said. "However, President Kennedy and his administration will continue to fight for the everyday American worker, and will encourage Congress to revisit this bill in the future."\n\nBusiness leaders and Wall Street celebrated the failure of the "communist" law, with the stock market having one of the best days in a decade at the news that the NLRA died. Even a majority of the American population seem to have agreed that the act was maybe a step too far, though the individual components of the law still poll well. So maybe there is a hope in the future?"

But in the past decades, the Federal government has attempted to force the states to accept top-down dictates on how and what to teach. The Power to the States Bill will prevent this. It's the individual state's job to determine what and how they teach, and we will get out of their way to do it."
bill_15_passed:0 "President Margaret Chase Smith today has signed the "Power to the States" Act into federal law, having passed through Congress last night after a midnight vote. The President addressed reporters in a press briefing after signing the law, stating that "...it is not the job of the federal government to mandate a one-size-fits-all approach to education in the fifty states of the nation. Each state, county and city knows what is best for them."\n\nThis law curtails the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would effectively allow various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.\n\nThe controversial law is a victory for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. However, opposition has been pronounced from civil rights activists as backsliding, and also from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states. But the law has passed, and a new normal for teaching will soon come to America."

After all, it's not the federal government's job to dictate how schools should operate in the states."\n\nThe defeated bill would have curtailed the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would have effectively allowed various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.

The opposition from civil rights activists, and from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states, was enough to convince a majority of senators to not go ahead.

With Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP working together, the new National Welfare Act would allow economic opportunity to millions of Americans, particularly in the South."
bill_17_passed:0 "After being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the National Welfare Act was passed in the Senate today and is soon to be signed into law by President Margaret Chase Smith. Winning an easy majority from both the National Progressive Party and the Republican-Democrats, it appears to have had a much broader base of support than was initially thought. Most happy at the news were the bill's main proponents: Senator Michael Harrington and Governor George Wallace, who came to a compromise on their differing views on welfare to create something that worked for both parties.\n\nAs soon as it is signed into law, millions of poor Americans -many of them from the poverty-stricken, rural South- will now be able to apply for government financial assistance. The bill's success has shown much of America that the National Progressive Party is truly capable of working together as a united political group on more than just foreign policy. It has also greatly strengthened the position of President Margaret Chase Smith, who stands to see a great uptick in her approval ratings."
bill_17_failed:0 "After a period of being pushed and deliberated in Congress, the results are in: the National Welfare Act died in the Senate. There was no dramatic filibuster from the Republican Democrats, nor a surprising change of allegiances that swept the vote; rather, there simply was not enough political support behind the bill. Senator Michael Harrington, who was one of the bill's main supporters, called the result "unfortunate".\n\nThe bill was heavily anticipated as the first instance of true cooperation in the National Progressive Party over welfare programs. Vocally supported by Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP, it found good ground in the House and quickly made its way to the Senate. Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace.

Historically, African Americans had little help from the government in their fight for freedom; even the Fifteenth Amendment only gave blacks the right to vote on paper. There was no way of enforcing the policy, and over time, Southern states exploited loopholes in order to maintain the status quo of the land: poll taxes, literacy tests, the infamous "Grandfather clause". All of this would change when the senators voted in favor of passing this bill. Desegregationists rejoiced, Southern politicians foamed at the mouth.\n\nThis act sternly outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Unequal voting requirements were abolished; schools, businesses, and other public accommodations were officially desegregated. African Americans essentially gained the right to go to any school, work for any business, and attend any public facility they choose. As a whole, African Americans had political power that the race had never seen before, and this was only the first step towards full desegregation.\n\nBut not all was well in the South. Immediately, Southern voters flocked to Strom Thurmond's Far-Right NPP in hopes that the bill would be reversed, that society would return to normal. Many Southerners despised this blatant attack on their livelihood, and with support from Southern politicians, they had the power to physically defeat desegregation.

RD_D_compromise_desc_101:0 "President Nixon spent a considerable amount of time pondering how to get the Southern Democrats to his side. The South always hated working with the North. If Nixon were to get through to the South, he would have to break this precedence by considering the one thing all Southerners hold dear: tradition.\n\nJoseph Clark Jr., a Pennsylvania senator, meets with Louisiana senator Allen J. Ellender. Both are Democrats, but the former advocates for civil rights while the latter is a hardcore segregationist, but a cooperative man. Clark is the first to speak. "I realize this new civil rights bill will have a far-reaching impact on the American South. But we're trying to work towards a plan that will free every American from discrimination."\n\nEllender had considered supporting the bill before but he knew that if it passed, the whole region would flare up. "Our states should choose their own direction with these so-called 'civil rights'-"\n\n"Your states have more important issues to address, Senator. This will be one legislation that provides opportunity for all Americans; it may boost your economy and make your region nicer to live in. After this, we will honor your state rights, but this must be an exception."\n\n"Do you not realize if this bill passes, our voters will turn to Thurmond's no-good Far-Right?"\n\n"I believe the storm will blow over eventually.

However, there is a small group discontent with America's involvement as a whole, but they are basically inconsequential."
USA_ICW_Discontent_2_desc:0 "With rising American involvement in the Indonesian Civil War, more public attention is being devoted to the conflict.

### Foreign tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Bombing_Airfields:0 "Our best planes are ready to take control of the skies over Sudwestafrika. We're going to bomb enemy airfields in the Sudwest to oblivion to ensure that our troops won't be harassed by any German planes.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Desert_Training:0 "The Namibian deserts are harsh, hot, and hostile for our troops stationed in South Africa. We must prepare them for the landscape so that we can force the Sudwest out of the war early.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Zentral_Liberville_NI:0 "Libreville is a valuable city within the Afrikan realm, providing essential supplies to enemy troops. We need to focus our energy into an attack on this city; if we take Libreville, we damage the Zentral, and we take important resources away from the Reich's grasp.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Ost_AgtOrng:0 "The rough terrain of Ostafrika renders a land invasion nearly impossible. Luckily, we have the Rainbow Pesticides on our side. The use of these substances would clear out all the impassable foliage and make an invasion of Ostafrika much easier for our soldiers.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Rock_and_Roll_Mother_Fucker:0 "The jungles of Ostafrika provide a natural citadel for the stationed German troops. If we are to defeat the enemy, we must train our guys in jungle warfare. We need to be able to move swiftly through the trees and hit the Germans where they least expect it.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_SAF_Buying_Out_Guns:0 "Our allies in South Africa are always in need of more guns, rifles, whatever we have. Seeing as they are our allies in this war, it is imperative that we keep their soldiers supplied. We don't want a supply issue to hinder us from winning this war, so let's ship more weapons their way.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_Buying_Up_Everything:0 "Not only do the South Africans need guns, but they also need artillery and support equipment. Shipping over some of these materials would give our ally a strategic advantage. We need all the help we can get from South Africa if we want to win this war.\n"
USA_Send_One_Advisor:0 "We may not be as involved in this war as South Africa and her enemies, but we can always increase the number of advisors we send over. Though it may cause some backlash, our logistics and battle plans would be improved, and we could invest more resources to ensure a victory over the Germans.\n"
USA_Send_Two_Advisors:0 "This war is becoming increasingly important every day that we are over here. We need to expand our logistics capabilities even more, we need to bring more troops to join the fight no matter how much hate we get back home.\n"


### Domestic Tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_Cranking_Up_Draft_tt:0 "The number of soldiers we are currently fielding is not nearly enough to win us the war. In order to bring more soldiers into the fold, we have to institute a draft. Many citizens back at home will certainly condemn us for this decision, but we must accept this consequence if we want to continue the fight."
USA_SAF_WAR_Cancelled_The_Draft_tt:0 "Our folks in the States are livid in their response to the draft. Protests are being held everywhere in our country, and we are starting to regret this decision. We must find a way to reverse the draft, no matter the cost, if we want to regain support for our government.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_No_More_Excuses_tt:0 "Ever since this war began, the practice of draft dodging has been widespread. In general, our young men are finding ways to avoid the draft. From this point forward, there will be no exceptions regarding who can be drafted. The more men we send over, the quicker this war will be over.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_reverse_the_exemptions_tt:0 "Our recently-drafted men are now resorting to even more drastic measures to ensure they can go back home. They are really bringing the morale of our whole army down; we must send them back, even if we have to lose some potential soldiers. Maybe the public will forgive this mishap.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_domestic_prop_tt:0 "Ever since the South African War began, people were holding anti-government protests. We need to activate the propaganda machine and cool the discontent that strangles our country. If we can convince the public that we can win this war, we will have one less domestic issue to worry about.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_take_out_troops_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been fighting for a while now, and we believe that giving a few battalions a trip home could work to our advantage. We may get some good publicity if we can bring some soldiers back home with smiles. This action would have a marginal effect on our remaining troops, but it would certainly give a little boost to war support.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_New_training_Shit_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been using up a lot of effort against the enemy. Not only does this produce a lack of ammo and supplies, but we also lose valued men when we put so much on the line. It's time to tone down the troops. We may lose some combat efficiency, but we will save human lives.\n"
USA_SAF_Talk_down_involvement_tt:0 "Support for this war is dwindling, and it's about time we put something in the papers. We have the option to reassure the public that we are not as involved in this war as the South Africans are. This will make our folks at home happy, but it could negatively impact South African troops and dampen their morale.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_bring_back_our_guns_tt:0 "This war is just not going in our favor, but we don't want to lose everything we have here. We must buy back the guns we loaned to our South African allies. This action would diminish whatever hopes our allies have left, but it would show the American public that we intend on ending the war soon."

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal things came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and fire rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from their bodies. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any ancient warmaster or khan. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. He made a signal and the helicopters left back through the smoke, blasting their music as they left the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten." #duplicate loc key

"대통령님, 저는 종종 길거리에 있는 사람들 - 착하고, 열심히 일하고, 정직한 미국인들 - 그들이 내년에 직업을 가질 수 있을지에 대한 의문을 가집니다. 이들 즉 광부, 철강 노동자, 농부들은 미국 산업의 고동치는 심장부입니다. 미국 정부가 외국 상품 구매에 보조금을 지급하고 미국인들은 동전이나 뒤지게 내버려 두는데 어떻게 미국을 강하게 유지한다고 주장할 수 있겠습니까?"\n\n베넷은 헤링턴을 향해 중립적으로 미소짓습니다. "무역의 아름다운 점은, 헤링턴 씨, 모두가 이익을 본다는 겁니다. 당신은 미국 산업이 약해지고 있다고 말합니다. 저는 관세가 OFN을 전체에서 인하됨에 따라 미국 산업은 점점 더 높이 팽창하고 있다고 생각합니다. 당신은 미국이 동맹국들로부터의 수입으로 인해 약해졌다고 말합니다. 우리가 나치가 괴뢰국들한테 하는 것 처럼 동맹국들을 쥐어 짜는걸 원합니까? 미국은 결코 이 세상에서 홀로 설 수 없으며, 독일인과 일본인과 같은 자들과 마주하고 있는 동안에는 확실히 그렇게 할 수 없습니다!

"베넷 대통령님, 당신은 OFN 내에서 더 자유로운 무역을 통해 자유 세계 사람들 사이의 형제애를 말하고 있습니다. 비록 OFN이 압제에 맞서 단결해야 하는건 맞지만, 저는 당신의 접근방식의 지혜에 의문을 제기합니다; 당신의 정책은 미국의 노동자들과 산업계에는 귀를 기울이지 않으면서 무모함과 리더십을 혼동합니다. 조약항은 우리에게 30년 전의 유화책 또는 오늘날 형제애에 대한 순진한 희망에 대한 미국의 이익을 무시하는 모든 비용을 상기시켜 주어야 합니다.\n\n"스미스 상원의원님, 우리는 미국이 자유롭고 번영하는 세계를 상징한다는 우리의 약속으로 일본, 독일과 우리 자신을 구별지을 수 있습니다. OFN은 사람들의 공동체이지 전체주의 지배나 식민지 의존을 위한 수단이 압니다. 자유 무역은 자유가 살아남는 가장 확실한 수단이며 자유롭고 열린 교환으로 사람들을 함께 묶습니다." 베넷 대통령은 스미스를 물끄러미 내려다보았습니다. "함께 번영하지 않으면 홀로 멸망합니다.”"

"헤링턴 씨, 당신의 공감능력은 존경하지만, 당신이 있는 단체에 대해 궁금한 점이 있습니다. 미국 국민들은 특히 거스 홀과 같은 사람들이 국유화와 계급 투쟁을 외치고 있는데, NPP가 이론이 아닌 실제로 어떻게 통치할 것인지 궁금해 합니다. 미국에는 할 일이 많지만, 부하린주의 헛소리를 지르는 것은 당신이 어떻게 해도 되는 짓이 아닙니다."\n\n 헤링턴의 얼굴이 분노로 일그러졌습니다. "그렇게까지 저급한 짓을 하십니까? 우리 중 가장 급진적인 사람으로 우리 당 전체를 판단하는 짓을요? 저는 분명히 말할 것입니다: 홀씨의 견해는 당의 극단에 있고, 저는 그들을 지지하지 않으며, 당 지도부는 그들을 지지하지 않습니다. 우리는 포용적인 미국, 배려하는 미국, 사람들이 검은 셔츠나 정치장교의 부츠를 두려워할 필요가 없고 대신 동료의 자선을 신뢰하는 미국을 지지합니다. 대통령님, 공공의 선이 아니라 두려움에 의지하는 것은 당신이 하는 짓입니다.

USA_debate.13.desc:0 "정치 기계들이 투표를 위해 거래를 하고 위원회가 항상 그래왔던 것처럼 기부 운동과 선거 운동을 주선하는 동안, 미국의 유권자 대중들은 4년주기의 전통행사의 최신판이 미국 전역의 가정의 평온을 가져다오는 것을 지켜보았습니다. 펜실베이니아 주 필라델피아의 월넛 스트리트 극장에서, 공화민주당 후보 로버트 맥나마라는 그의 국가진보당의 상대 후보 마거릿 체이스 스미스와 그의 첫 번째 TV 대선 토론에서 국내외의 주제들을 다루었습니다. 그 날 밤 그들의 열띤 교류의 발췌문은 다음과 같습니다:\n\n맥나마라: "우리가 다시 한번 자유세계의 관리자로서의 의무를 다해야 할 때가 곧 올 것입니다. 미래의 개입의 가능성 또는 필요성을 인정하는 것을 속이는 것은 역효과적인 어리석음입니다. 그런 점에서, 저는 스미스 대통령과 제가 전적으로 동의하는 것에 감사하고 있습니다. 하지만 저는 우리가 사전 개입과 그 과정에서 저지른 실수로부터 배워야 할 의무도 있다고 믿습니다. 우리가 의무를 더 잘 수행 할수도 있다는 겁니다. 유감스럽게도, 대통령 여사님이 소홀한 부분이죠"\n\n스미스 : "장관님, 저는 당신의 영업 구호에 그렇게 쉽게 속지 않겠습니다. 당신이 우리 군대에 가한 막무가내식 모욕에도 불구하고, 우리가 남아공과 같은 실수로부터 배운 것은 사실이에요. 인도네시아와 중동에서 우리 군대의 눈부신 활약은 럼즈펠드씨와 그의 미국 국민을 위한 개혁을 입증해 주었습니다. 따라서 우리는 이제 언제든지 자유세계에 대한 공격에 대응할 수 있는 군대를 자랑할 수 있습니다. 그리고 덧붙이자면 이렇게 함으로서 알링턴 묘지에 들어갈 수천개의 십자가를 줄이는 거죠""

"우리가 오늘날 어디에 있을 수 있었는지 상상해 보십시오."라고 그는 말했습니다. "만약 우리가 총과 폭탄에 소비한 수십억 달러가 골목길과 게토에 살고 있는 수백만 명의 사람들에게 흘러갔다면, 전체 나라보다 경영진들의 은행 계좌가 더 부유한 일은 없었을 것입니다!"\n\n맥나마라는 파시스트 침탈로부터 자유세계를 보호하겠다는 미국의 약속을 되풀이하며 반박했는데, 이는 강력한 군사력으로만 수행될 수 있다고 그는 주장했습니다. "헤링턴 대통령은 남아공과 인도네시아로부터 교훈을 얻어 자유세계의 발전을 위해 이를 적용해야 할 책임이 있습니다."라고 장관은 상세히 설명했습니다. "그들의 선서한 보호자가 국방의 책임을 져버리는 것은 축하할 만한 업적이 아니라 우리의 통수권자로서의 그의 기록에 대한 중대한 오점입니다.""

OFN을 무시하는 것은 무례와 범죄의 경계선 사이에 있습니다. 당신은 이 일의 목적을 고려하지도 않고 그것이 초청하는 외국과의 관계를 비난합니다. 즉, 세계의 자유국가를 그들이 자립할 수 있을 때까지 육성하는 것 말입니다. 자유세계가 시시각각으로 시들어가는 동안 우리는 못본척 아메리카를 어슬렁거리지 않을 것입니다. 균형은 어떻게든 맞춰져야 합니다. 균형이 존재합니다. 당신이 그것을 찾으려고 노력했더라면 좋았을 겁니다."\n\n헤링턴 : "의원님, 혹시 성경 읽어보셨나요? '악인의 길은 돌로 평평하게 닦여있지만, 그 끝에는 지옥의 구덩이가 있다.' 저는 해외에서의 무의미한 모험에 대한 의욕을 잃은 미국을 대변합니다; 그 모험을 요구하는 사람들과 우리 자신을 더 가깝게 놓는 것은 남아공, 인도네시아, 아라비아에서 우리가 목격했던 피의 소굴로 이어진 돌로 길을 닦는것 놓는 것과 다를 바 없습니다. 저는 미국이 언젠가는 국경을 넘어 억압받는 민족을 향해 전폭적인 관심을 가질 것이라고 확신합니다. 하지만 지금은 그렇지 않습니다. 우리 자신의 자유에 대한 요구가 여전히 이렇게 많이 존재하는 한 말입니다.""

Now, years after the simmering defeat of the last great war, the government finds itself facing these enemies once more, not within the wintry dread of political machinations and espionage; rather, it is time for the United States to prepare once more for the battlefield. Now is the time for the United States to rise, and lead the march for freedom, for liberty, for democracy!\n\nThanks to the preparations of our administrations and Presidents prior, the United States has come leagues ahead of preparedness compared to our worries of the past. However, we have a long path ahead of us if we intend to defeat the enemies of America. Nevertheless, we shan't suffer again, we shall defeat these bastards, once and for all!"
USA_ww3_mobilize_the_army_desc:0 "The United States, despite the sufferings of wars lost in history's turned pages, has grown to possess one of the most effective, most respected, and most powerful armies on the world's stage. Thousands of American men and women have proven themselves as heroes of the American people in the Army.\n\nHowever, although the power within the Army remains unquestioned, we must face the realities of some issues. The Army is a ferocious beast, but a beast that must be roused to action from slumber. However, the war-cries of Americans' enemies have rung out across the world; thus, it is time to spurn our own beast to action, and let loose the true hounds of war: the United States Army. The Army must begin immediate effective mobilization in order to respond to the growing encroachment of enemy forces, while bringing the reserves to the front lines. The United States Army must be prepared to take the offensive and be ready to strike!"
USA_ww3_scramble_the_airforce_desc:0 "The skies, holding the sun, the moon, and the stars, have become the newest addition to the ways in which humanity can wage warfare. From the skies above the Marne to the storms raging above Saint-Mihiel, the United States set a precedent for the quality sought in men seeking to bring the fury of the United States Armed Forces to the heavens above.\n\nHowever, the strength of our enemies have grown to match such fury, and bring about fiery destruction with their advancements in technology and tactics, with the potential of our enemies to spread death and terror if they penetrate our air defenses. Furthermore, the administration has come to realize that the Air Force being spread out across the country has handicapped its ability to move effectively to the new warzones being created everyday. We must set the Air Force to the highest alert, and have our aerial units ready to face the enemy within a moment's notice!"
USA_ww3_emergency_naval_procurement_act_desc:0 "The Pentagon's forecast attrition rates beggar belief. Soldiers, equipment, ships, and aircraft will be written off at an astronomical rate, expended to keep the war far from the American homeland. That assumption depends on the ability of the Navy to continue to prosecute the war and supply our troops abroad. If the Pentagon's estimates are accurate, the shipyards will need to be spun up to full capacity now to make sure the Navy keeps the war away from home."
USA_ww3_naval_invasion_crash_course_desc:0 "Although the protection of a navy shows in the guarding the open waters surrounding the United States on all sides, it can be safely assumed that the United States Navy can only act as a shield around our lands for so long. The Fascists have struck quickly and viciously before, and we cannot hope that staying on the defense will save us. No, we shall penetrate the barriers of the seas to strike against our enemies shores, to plunge the sword of the American military deep into the hearts of our enemies before we dare allow them to take the first step.\n\nUnfortunately, although the plans shall be ambitious, we must prepare for such aspirations lest we intend to see our military plunge to the bottom of the seas. Thus, the administration shall immediately order the instruction of naval invasion preparation and execution to our military command. Our command will take the first step, strike first, and cut the throat of the beast before it dares to claim the lives of any more good-hearted Americans!"
USA_ww3_impliment_war_bonds_desc:0 "America's participation in the first two World Wars stretched the financial resources of the country to the limit, and the realities of modern, mechanized warfare have come at a higher cost than we could have ever imagined. Income taxation will not nearly be enough to fill the yawning chasm of the discretionary budget, and our financial institutions and capital markets are beginning to balk at the successive regular bond issuances by the Treasury. We need to take our financing drive directly to the American people, mobilizing their savings for the war effort through retail war bonds."
USA_ww3_nationalize_air_industry_desc:0 "The United States has had a long term of industrial superiority, both as it continues to grow within history, as well as when it is spurned into a furious upkeep in supporting the nation, such as what happened during the Second World War. In those years past, the people of the United States acted as the blood within the Great Dragon that awoke, allowing the production necessary to modernize the war effort in the skies above.\n\nNow, however, we, as Americans, have found ourselves facing the damning strength of our enemies. Now, what we need is not only the talent and experience of the military, but the equipment necessary to secure our superiority, especially within the skies. Thus, the administration will work towards nationalizing several airline manufacturers to bring them to support the war effort within the United States. Sure, our critics may cite this as 'feeding the Military-Industrial Complex,' but we are at war, damnit!"

Gunnery Sergeant Hewitt commanded, exploding into the dark and formerly silent resting quarters of the young soldiers. Bannister hurried to attention, as had his fellow Soldiers all around him as they all faced forwards where the Gunnery Sergeant came forward. "Get your shit together, men, the United States is at war! Get your utilities on and your asses in gear, be formed up outside the barracks at 0430, move it!" the Gunnery Sergeant exploded before leaving the room. The glass of stability which had continuously wavered in strength for Bannister was shattered as the Gunnery Sergeant left the room. Sure, he'd trained and all for the prospect of serving his country, but he never expected the day would come when everything went to hell like this. Bannister threw his uniform together as best he could and hurried out, along with the rest of his platoon.\n\nOutside, the frigid air of an early Kentucky morning was evident, but the rush of fear and terror was what truly crawled up the soldiers that morning. Standing at attention, Bannister stared forward as he saw his Gunnery Sergeant come into frame, yelling to his platoon, "The United States of America has, as all of you know, entered a state of war with the same men responsible for our defeat in the 1940's. Some of your fathers know that all too well, some of them may have even fought alongside myself back in England. All of that has come back, and we will not allow those bastards to harass the world any longer. Your platoon is being transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where you will all undergo extensive training to prepare for deployment out to fight those who think they can fuck with the goddamned United States. Hooah, soldiers." the Gunnery Sergeant concluded.\n\nAs Private Bannister continued forward with the rest of his platoon to get onto the trucks heading to Fort Carson. But no matter what, he couldn't shake the fear out of his head. This was it, what if he never got to see Jennifer again? Or, what about the rest of his family, and his little brother?

He waited his turn in line for hours until finally, he exchanged his paperwork with the woman behind the desk, approving him for his conscripted entrance into the United States Army after a quick physical and mental health check and approval test with the words "infantrymen" written on top. A few days later, he looked out the window of the moving truck, thinking of how he was going to be toting a rifle on some battlefield, surrounded by blood and filth, instead of studying economics at Stanford like the plan was.. However, the journey didn't end there, as he sat while his hair was nearly shaved off by the Army barbers at Fort Carson. Finally, a Staff Sergeant came over to the new recruits, yelling, "Welcome to the United States Army, gentlemen. The United States has gone to war and we need your talent to serve the armed forces now more than ever." His voice droned on, but Isaac picked up as he heard the Staff Sergeant continue, "...Summers, Drake, Clarence, you eight are gonna be led by Corporal Bannister." as the soldier moved forward to the rightmost of the squad. Now, out in the middle of Colorado, was where the army's finest will find their way to the front lines.\n\nThe mud continued to gunk up Isaac's teeth as the barbed wire scraped against his ankles, as the recruit crawled and gunshots popped above him at the firing ranges nearby. All of a sudden, a hand popped in front of him beneath the barbed wire, and Corporal Bannister's face came out of the blur. "Come on, man, I've got you." The corporal said, as he helped pull Isaac forward. Isaac felt a genuine care and concern within the Corporal's voice as he got through it, feeling a connection to his squad leader."

USA.WW3.4.desc:0 "Private Summers looked off the bow of the USS General John Pope as his utilities contrasted heavily from the cold, open seas around him. Despite all of the harrowing difficulties, he had been hastily transformed from the next applicant to an Ivy League college to a true soldier of the United States Army. His feelings had devolved from resentment to a difficult mix of steadfastness and dread as the ship journeyed onwards. The Private's thoughts had almost drowned out the stomping of boots behind him as his squad leader, Corporal Bannister approached, rousing Summers to attention.\n\n"You're fine, Summers, take the time to enjoy yourself." Bannister said to the young Private, who looked troubled. "Thinking ahead?" the Corporal asked, thinking about the weeks they had spent travelling aboard the John Pope.. "Honestly, sir, no. Thinking about the past, more like, thinking of everything before all of this, before, well, the draft went out, uh, sir." He said while looking out into the waves crashing on the side of the boat. "Yeah, I get that, Summers. I didn't get that whole draft thing, I was down at the most comfortable base in Kentucky, thinking about how serving the country could help out paying for the wedding with my Jennifer. Think she's gonna be pissed with how long I'll be gone." The Corporal said, chuckling. Noticing his squadling's less than enthusiastic response, he asked, "Well, what about you, Summers? Where are you from?" The Private took a minute to respond, thinking of everything leading up to now. "Came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, just graduated out of high school, finalizing my application to Stanford to study economics, was thinking of going federal with the job. Managed to get top of my class too, things were looking great. Sure, no girlfriend, like you, sir, and only a mom back at home, but it looks like the world had other plans."\n\nThe Corporal heard the Private's downtrodden voice, and offered a pat on the back. "Hey, I wasn't a Stanford kid, and economics aren't my forte, but what's to say we have to be sad about it. Things are rough, but the country needs us, good people like your mother needs us, now more than ever. If you wanted to help change the world, you've found your way there, Summers, because America needs people like you who can grit their teeth and keep going. Besides, fascism's gotta suck for the economy, huh?" the Corporal said, offering one last pat on the shoulder before walking away."

The salesman, in the living room of his client, provided what counsel he could.\n\n"Hank, John's going to be alright. He was studying engineering, I'm sure he'll be doing research -"\n\nHank, a corporate lawyer by trade, was lost for words. "John called yesterday. Said he'd been assigned to the infantry, deploying overseas. I -" Hank hesitated. "I'm proud of him, Arthur. But..."\n\n"I'm sorry," Arthur replied. Everyone had a brother, a cousin, or an uncle called to serve, even as the nuclear drills made it uncertain whether anyone would survive at all. Material comforts, it turned out, did little to salve the existential terror of living through the Third World War.\n\n"It's alright, Arthur. Times are tough." Hank forced a laugh. "I just wish there was something I could do for my boy."\n\nArthur was silent for a moment, before reaching into his briefcase for the offering memorandum for the first retail issue of U.S. war bonds.

USA.early_flavor.1.desc:0 "Henry Jackson - known affectionately to his contemporaries as "Scoop" - sat at his desk, looking expectantly at the two figures sitting opposite. Maurine Neuberger, Scoop's deputy and fellow senator in the NPP's Center wing, quietly thumbed through her notes as she waited for him to speak. Next to her sat the nominal head of the Center's more radical wing, Michael Harrington, who waited with the same expectant look as Scoop himself. The two could not be more different, but as the Center's leader, Scoop knew he needed both if the party was going to get anywhere.\n\n"As you know, our election prospects are still looking dire," began Scoop. "The Right still holds plenty of influence over the party, and no progressive voter is going to vote for the party whose last candidate was Strom goddamn Thurmond. Worst of all, we still don't even have a candidate!"\n\n"Well it would help if anyone had bothered to put their name forward," joked Harrington, with a bare hint of contempt. "Perhaps if we were to do more to support our core working class voters in the Midwest and elsewhere rather than kowtowing to segregationists... and filling our ranks with West Coast elitist types-"\n\nNeuberger, herself of proud Oregon stock, sat up with an offended look. "Everyone here is fighting for the same thing! I've done plenty to speak up for the underprivileged - at least I don't just sit around writing essays about it!"\n\nScoop sat still for a moment, smiling bemusedly as his colleagues continued to bicker and snipe at one another. In a way, they were a perfect reflection of the Center as a whole - determined to enact change, but endlessly at its own throat about what that change should be. Finally, he coughed, and the other two immediately ceased their childish exchange and looked to him once more. "You are both very different, which is exactly why we need somebody who can speak everyone's language. If we're to have any hope in this election, we need to move forwards with one voice."\n\nHarrington and Neuberger looked at each other unsure of what to say. Scoop glanced out the window with an uncertain look. "I don't know who the man to lead us is. But he better show up soon. Or we are screwed.""

Opposite him sat a smiling man who the party registry knew as his chief of staff, but who John had always known as his brother.\n\n"It's been too long since we've taken time to ourselves," said John with a smile. "How are you, Bobby? Ethel still taking good care of you I hope?"\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy laughed at the playful wink his brother gave him. "I can hardly complain on the home life, Jack." His grin faded. "Still, current events haven't exactly been great for my sleep."\n\nThe older Kennedy nodded sympathetically. "The violence is getting worse, for sure." He frowned. "Nixon being a stick in the mud about it isn't helping things either. He still won't endorse any legislation on the matter."\n\n"Can't you do something about it? As long as the President sits on the fence, things will only get worse."\n\n"I'd love to, but you know how Nixon is," muttered John, idly stirring his coffee. "Knowing him he'd probably just veto whatever we put in front of him and yell at us for 'fracturing party unity'.\n\n"But this is far more important than party unity Jack! There are millions of Americans - millions of good, honest people - being cast aside for things that are far beyond their control. The longer we wait, the greater their suffering will be." Fixing his brother with an intense but encouraging look, he continued. "You're the Vice President. At the very least you can use your voice in the name of those who have no voice."\n\nJohn was silent for a moment. Then he smiled. "You've always been a good man, Bobby. You are right, of course, I must act.""

The circumstances aren't ideal, but I can think of no better man to be President right now." Robert could barely contain his adoring smile. "Think of all the things we can finally accomplish!"\n\n"Come on, Bobby, you're embarrassing me," chuckled John, who beamed nonetheless. "But thank you. I know I can always count on you."\n\n"Always. Like I'd leave you for the NPP or anyone else, especially when you're about to give this country the change it so desperately deserves!"\n\nRobert's enthusiasm, seemingly infectious, prompted more laughs from his brother. "Now, now, we have a lot of work to get through before we can set things in motion." His look became more serious, more determined. "The party's image is somewhat tarnished at the moment with the Nixon fiasco, so I've arranged some trips across the country to shore up support." At this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long itinerary of events and dates in various states and cities and handed it to Robert.\n\n"Of course. We do have the election to worry about." Robert frowned, before reverting to a smile. "Come on Jack, I suppose we can just enjoy this meal before your big tour, you've earned it."\n\nAnd so the brothers sat for a while longer, enjoying their food in peace. As the time finally came for them to leave, Robert quickly glanced at the list and noted his brother's first destination. He smiled at his brother one last time before they departed.\n\n"I know you'll do great Jack. I'll see you when you get back from Dallas.""

Kennedy could not hold back his tears.\n\nHe was supposed to give a big speech about his brother's legacy, about the strength and dedication of his character and how he was an example to all within the halls of power. That was true enough, but as he sat in the holding area awaiting his cue, he could only think of John as the brother he had looked up to. His greatest inspiration and his closest friend. He wondered if he should just call it off, so great was his grief. Grief, and anger.\n\nJohn was killed because he was the president. He was only the president because of the Republican-Democrats. Because of Nixon lying like a bitch and doing everything in his power to stop progress and change, killing the Civil Rights Act and forcing John to step up to the firing line in the most damnably literal way. The party had chewed him up and spat him out. They had used him, just like they had used the entire Kennedy family and dragged their name through the mud.\n\nWhen a staffer poked their head into the room to wave him on stage, Robert stilled his tears, and prepared to give what would become one of the most shocking speeches of his career. After slowly ascending to the podium, he addressed the assembled crowd, giving a short but passionate eulogy in honor of his brother, extolling his candor, his way with words, and his dedication to America. The crowd nodded along, some cried, some bowed their heads. But none of them could prepare for what came next.\n\n"My brother was loyal to the Republican-Democrats through and through. He was loyal as they made every effort to avoid bringing this country true equality and justice. He was loyal as they charged blindly into an unnecessary and bloody war in Africa. He was loyal as he was ignored until the time where they needed a man to clean up their mistakes, and he was loyal as the fallout of their ignorance resulted in the loss of his life." He paused as many in the crowd stared agape. At least two from the party mouthed words of astonishment and curses at him. His next line would live on in infamy.\n\n"I was loyal to the Republican-Democrats also. That ends today"."

He wondered if what he was doing was too much, or if anyone would take him seriously given that he had been an establishment stooge for far too long. Still, he had to try.\n\nFinally, the door to the office swung open. In walked Scoop Jackson, closely followed by his underlings Neuberger and Harrington. The three regarded Kennedy curiously yet hopefully as they sat opposite him, each shaking his hand in turn. Scoop was the first to speak. "This is certainly unusual. But I hear good things about you, Mr Kennedy. We have a few questions for you before we go any further."\n\nOver the next twenty minutes, the impromptu Center committee picked Robert's brains over a wide variety of issues. "How committed are you to the Civil Rights Act?" asked Scoop. "You agree that the state of healthcare in this country is disgraceful?" asked Harrington. "Don't you think this country should do more to protect the environment?" asked Neuberger. It felt almost like a college debate club, but Robert answered all their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically.\n\nAs their questioning came to a close, Robert spoke up. "The Republican-Democrats no longer represent this country, nor are they willing to do what is necessary for its people. I want to join you because I feel that you represent the change that I believe in... and the change that my brother believed in."\n\nScoop glanced sideways to his associates.

It occurred to him that if every human being had the opportunity to see what he could see - how insignificant all the struggles and wars and vendettas were - the world might finally know peace. A peace where everyone could work towards the advancement of science, prosperity and-\n\nA sudden ringing cut across his psyche, and he was jolted from a dream of days past. Sitting sluggishly awake from his sadly earthbound bed, he fumbled for the telephone on his bedside cabinet and pulled the receiver to his ear. "John Glenn, speaking - way too early in the morning might I add."\n\nA panicked voice came across the line. "John, it's James. Have you heard the news?"\n\nGlenn rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and replied "James Edwin Webb, I have not even got out of bed yet. Be more specific-"\n\n"They're defunding NASA!"\n\nA hastily-made coffee and frantic flip through the morning paper later, and John Glenn felt a wrench in his gut as he faced the prospect of his life's work being all for naught. "So what, the Germans got to the moon first and that just means space is over? What can we do? They can't just give up on the future!"\n\n"Nixon's already made his mind up. He wants to move the money over to the military and other 'practical projects'". Webb paused as Glenn made an outraged intake of breath. "I really don't think there's anything that can stop him at this point. I'm sorry, John."\n\nGlenn felt himself back in the rivierre of space flight. The government could not let the dream of space be but a dream. America had to live to see the stars. "Nothing we can do? We'll see about that.""

Now, he needed to make a big splash.\n\n"I had just been having a pleasant dream about my last mission, when my good friend James Webb woke me with the news. I was distraught, to say the least, to know that the government was giving up on the future of space travel. Partly because the thought of never going up there myself again is saddening to consider, but that's not the only reason.\n\n"By ending our involvement in space, President Nixon has given up. He has accepted stagnation and decline, abandoning the stars to the fascist powers. He says we 'lost' the space race, but as long as the stars still shine space will never be lost. I implore that the President reconsider his options. The future of America, and the human species as a whole, lies above us."\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, Glenn made his closing remarks, and was greeted with raucous applause. He felt satisfied that his words had hit their mark, and with so many journalists in attendance tomorrow's papers would carry them further still. Yet he still felt defeated. His words alone would not be enough to save NASA.\n\nIf American space travel was to have a future, it would need a voice to represent it in the halls of power. John Glenn had never been one for politics, but as he thought on it, he realised that political office may be his best course of seeing his dream fulfilled.

What I am proposing is really not that radical - all the Silver Act suggests is that we reduce that reliance both within the federal budget and in the private sector." This was perhaps the third time he had explained this simple concept to the assembled senators, and many were listening intently, but Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen to enact his characteristic bullish persona to derail the discussion.\n\n"And I also say it's pretty simple - that you are wasting time arguing over which metal we base our currency on. Last I checked, America was still an economic giant by all accounts, so I really fail to see the merit of this passion project of yours." Johnson scoffed as he leaned informally against his desk, and Bennett felt his blood pressure steadily rise at the lack of respect.\n\n"We can be so much stronger though, Mr Johnson. Myself and my colleagues have done much research into the matter. We haven't even begun to get into the hard data - allow me to show you the charts-"\n\n"I will gladly look at your graphs, Mr Bennett, but given the times we live in, I still say that silver is a rather small thing to get worked up over." Johnson chuckled idly as Bennett launched into more discussion, clearly not listening.\n\nBelittling as always, thought Bennett. Johnson was supposed to be his ally. The Republicans and the Democrats were supposed to be allies. Yet even the Center and Right NPP seemed to have a better and more equal relationship than the two sides of his party did these days. As a Democrat, Bennett felt increasingly sidelined. That would have to change, he decided then and there.\n\nAfter the ultimately fruitless discussion came to a close, the two men passed each other as the senators left the hall for lunch.

USA_IR.1.t:0 "이란 내전"
USA_IR.1.d:0 "In recent years, we have seen Persia become a wide breeding ground for oppression and ruthless authoritarianism during the rule of Pahlavi. Pressures from Berlin and Tokyo have caused a cave-in for the fragile political structure of the once-proud nation. However, the people have started to speak out against tyranny, and our shining opportunity is developing itself right before our eyes. The National Front, formerly outlawed under the Shah's one-party dynasty, has made a resurgence in the local population, and every class seems to show its support: farmers, soldiers, and noblemen alike. In a surprising referendum directed at the parliament, the people demanded free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, among others. The result? Over two hundred "freedom fighters" dead, over a thousand wounded. Angered at this sight, democratic politicians continued to speak out against the Shah, all while building up a competent army in the southern half of the country along the Zagros Mountains and the Persian coast. A constitution was signed and the new Republic of Iran seceded only a few hours ago.\n\nPersia is the gate through which the Caucasus, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East can be accessed. We also don't want the barbaric German eagle spreading his talons over the oil reserves in Iran. With a friendly government, any chance the Germans have at filling up their Panzers with Persian oil is slim. If the Liberals win this conflict, they could be our "experiment" with democracy in the region, a beacon of hope for the peoples of the Middle East. We must be hasty; the frail democracy is already on the defensive."

USA_IR.2.t:0 "The Iranian Aid Bill"
USA_IR.2.d:0 "Just this morning, Congress passed the Iranian Aid Bill with an acceptable majority, giving us the power to send volunteers and military advisers to the National Front forces. Until our equipment can reach the Persian coast, we have invested $100 million to keep the Liberals fighting. Furthermore, this bill ensures our lasting cooperation with the Republic of Iran, and we are now committed to keeping the candle lit for as long as possible.\n\nAlready, as the money flows into the newly established nation, the locals have been praising us for our swift efforts. We have also been getting positive reports from the population here, and it seems people are more eager to combat oppression in Iran than in any other war in the past decade. We cannot fail the public now."

Two options were given: we either send our own men into combat to directly influence the course of the war, or we supply the National Front from a distance and let the Iranians be the ones fighting.\n\nThe advisers supporting direct involvement argue that offensives will be carried out quicker and that results will be seen much faster. Our troops are much more trained and ready than the Liberal troops. Americans may die on the battlefield but the overall number of casualties will be lower than if we only sent weapons. Officers supporting indirect involvement claim that if the U.S. Army lands on Persian soil, it could bring Germany or Japan into the conflict, and that is certainly not in our best interests. The public isn't showing support for this kind of intervention either, and it would take a resounding victory to even dent their disapproval.\n\nThe advisers supporting indirect involvement claim that, first and foremost, less Americans will be sacrificed for freedom. We can trust that the Iranians are capable of using the latest technologies we have to offer. The introduction of our arsenal is enough of a boost for the National Front troops. The Germans and Japanese are less likely to intervene if we only send supplies. Critics believe this will produce a larger death toll and the war will be drawn out longer.\n\nWe either send troops and risk it all or we trust the National Front to take care of the job using our technology."

This time, the U.S. must decide whether its soldiers will attempt a swift advance to end the war or prepare for the long haul war of attrition. If we send enough soldiers in to overwhelm the enemy, there is a clear chance the war would end once Tehran capitulates. However, if this advance fails, there will be a monumental loss of American life, and the war might as well be lost. It is a big risk, but if our troops can pull it off, the war will be won handily and we have our Middle Eastern ally.\n\nAlternatively, we can expect the long-term war from the start and try to wear down our foe over time. The war may be longer, but we would have no risk of failing and embarrassing ourselves on the world stage again. At the same time, there would be no chance of a swift victory. This route allows for a greater conservation of resources and all our soldiers would have to do is hold out longer. The idea may not sit well with the average soldier, but it is meant to keep him safe.\n\nIn conclusion, our military either risks the entire operation on one single offensive, or we hold everything in the trenches and wait for the enemy to attack us.

Once the U.S. lost enough men, generals made the quick decision to pull out and leave the war solely to the Liberals. Not even a day after the last U.S. soldier left Iran did the National Front sign a peace agreement.

To American audiences, the thought that someone could just order a nuclear attack on a whim was something that could only happen from Germania or Tokyo, not in the good ol' USA. The flailing efforts to recall the bombers, and the German revelation of a Doomsday Device that would kill all life on earth as the bombers head for Japan just further confounds the audience's expectations.

It will be recognized by future generations as a classic of filmmaking. Kubrick's obsessive attention to detail in everything from the camera work to the exact facial expressions of the actors on screen. The brilliant acting of Peter Sellers in three separate roles: as a British emigre RCAF officer who tries to restrain the American general, the unready and soft-spoken President of the US thrust into a diplomatic crisis, and the creepy and comedic Dr. Strangelove, a Russian scientist who has some crazy ideas of how to rebuild the US in the aftermath of the now inevitable nuclear war involving cross-breeding people with plants.

He calls for politicians to take "immediate and remedial action" to rid the country of every aspect of poverty.\n\nCritics of the novel disagree with Harrington's socialist tendencies, but most readers agree with the call to action. The book has already gained influence on a number of politicians in the capital who want to create a better country for every citizen, rich or poor. Economists are already devising ways to make education and health care more accessible in the country."

 USA.culture.15.desc:0 "How do you move one of the most famous paintings in the world from its regular home, across an ocean, and on display without damaging it or risking the threat of robbery? Simple: pack it in a specially designed, bulletproof casing that will also protect it from temperature, humidity, and UV rays. And make it waterproof and floatable, just to be on the safe side. Then transport it, under armed guard, with motorcades, block traffic and more, to deliver it to the ship to take it on it's trip across the Atlantic. Then, when it does arrive in New York, load it in an armored van and take it to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and when it is finally displayed, station two Marines, each with loaded rifles, on either side to ensure no one gets near it.\n\nThe more interesting question, however, is why would you send one of the most famous paintings in the world to the US?\n\nWhen the French heard that their government was considering loaning the Mona Lisa to the US for a couple of months, there were protests and riots. The painting has been in the Louvre for so long, through war and catastrophe, an enduring symbol of French cultural history (even if it was taken from the Italians hundreds of years ago), and now it was being given to the Americans? What a travesty this is! To hell with diplomacy! This is an outrage that can never be lived down!\n\nBut for the 500,000 Americans, including the President, every member of the House of Representatives and Senate, the Justices of the Supreme Court, and many, many more average people, the image of the lady has captivated them. With her enigmatic smile experty captured by Leonardo de Vinci, the Mona Lisa has captivated a nation and people that for so long was considered uncultured. Within weeks, museums and art galleries around the US reported an uptick in visits to see what they had on display, even if nothing could match the graceful lady that will soon return back home."

Every voter knows that their ballots will have no power. That's not the point. The point is to make a statement to Mississippi blacks that voting is possible, and to make a statement to the world that there's currently no such thing as democracy in Mississippi.\n\nMore than 80,000 people will cast their votes in the 1963 Freedom Ballot, several times more than are registered to vote in the entire state. It won't end segregation, or voter discrimination. White civil servants will put on their suits tomorrow, and quiz prospective voters on inane things, and deny them their franchise.

With the Oil War and hardships it brought, America's tastes have finally shifted in full towards fuel economy and cost.\n\nThe now-venerable Mustang would have suffered the same fate as its fellow burdensome beasts were it not for the haste of its parent company's engineers. Plans were made in Dearborn to accommodate the gasoline rations and reigning economic slump to their car's design: Lengths and widths were cut short, gas-guzzling V8s replaced with compact I4s, and frames modified to reduce noise and vibration as its dimensions shrink. Drawing from their failures with the Pinto, Ford set out to effectively downsize their flagship muscle car into a form suiting the American family's increasingly tight purses.\n\nThe end result is the second-generation Mustangs, or the Mustang IIs, released with aplomb today. Seemingly satisfied with this compromise between economy and style, men with means have gone out to purchase Ford's new-old car in droves. Analysts estimate that Mustang II orders will reach more than 400,000 by New Year's, hopefully foretelling that Ford's greatest success will continue succeeding for another decade yet."

Thousands flocked to the capital to view statues of soldiers raising the American flag, replicas of American battleships, and the centerpiece of the monument: a large "peace fountain" that contained the names of every soldier known to have died in the Pearl Harbor attacks. Gardens were also planted in honor of the fallen soldiers, and it quickly became the site of mourning throughout the area.\n\nFlowers were left at the base of the fountain, coins littered the fountain floor. For the Americans who had no flowers to give nor coins to donate, they gave the utmost respect for the fallen soldiers who perished in the face of destruction.

Never in the present has there been a depiction of this mythical age truer than Italy's youngest province.\n\nItalian filmmaker Sergio Leone demonstrated his awareness of such when he released For a Few Dollars More late this year. Featuring up-and-coming Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood as a rough, tough-speaking mercenary, the movie brought new life to an old genre while introducing its own refreshing themes. Standoffs between lawmen and bandits in desolate mining towns were joined with the ambitions of laconic bounty hunters and long-held grudges, tied together in a captivating plot centered around a heist. Though the film depicted America's Old West, the conflicts it had shown resonated with the Italian pioneers seeking their fortunes in their country's new frontier.\n\nDespite less than stellar reception from film critics for its over-the-top violence and "campy" tone, the film nevertheless broke records by reaching $4 million in ticket sales in Italy by year's end. North America added an extra $14 million to the film's gross revenue, proving that there is a place for the now-termed "Spaghetti Western" in the Free World's silver screens.

Graham and Halberstam served as writing leads behind the movie itself, with Graham stating that "David and I wanted to deliver a trek through the perils that came with the Nixon scandal as we had experienced: terrifying, back-breaking, and, well, exhilarating. As every time we felt our hearts' racing, we wanted the audience to feel that rush just the same."\n\nThat being said, key figures within the Republican-Democrat Party have come forward in criticism of the movie, with the Republican-Democrats stating that "it puts a hole through our work in trying to help the United States."

This mythos is seeping into media about California, like films, television, and especially music.\n\nA vocal harmony group from Hawthorne, California who call themselves the "Beach Boys" recently released their first album, Surfin' Safari, to moderate success. While they've had regional success with a few singles, their producer Capitol Records have surprisingly reported satisfactory sales of the album nationwide. Other so-called "surf rock" acts like Dick Dale and Jan & Dean are also recording their own studio albums, and some are wondering whether they will also find success away from the Pacific coast."

 USA.culture.36.desc:0 "The California surf rock group the Beach Boys are at it again, releasing their second album Surfin' USA to acclaim nationwide. While some thought that the success of Surfin' Safari was a fluke and they would quickly return to being a regional success at best, the sales statistics have blown those doubts out of the water. The album has risen to #2 on Billboard's Hot 200 Albums nationwide, an absolutely meteoric rise for any musical group, let alone a bunch of relative newcomers to the recording industry.\n\nIt seems that the Beach Boys were able to capture that California mythos and encapsulate it in a record, with their carefree and fun-loving lyrics about surfing, the beaches of LA, and the girls that inhabit them. The American people are positively enchanted by it, and people are scrambling to get their hands on singles and LPs as soon as the record stores have them in stock. A new national tour is being planned for the fall, and an Australian one for the winter—while some are concerned that it'll keep the Beach Boys out of the studio and unable to produce a new album sooner, many others are delighted for their chance to see their new favorite band live."

 USA.culture.37.t:0 ""Surfmania" Sweeps the Nation"
 USA.culture.37.desc:0 "A tidal wave from the Pacific is sweeping over the nation—a musical one! The California mythos seems to have gripped the heart of every boy and girl in the country, and they simply can't get enough of everything West Coast! Hollywood is cranking out films like Elvis Presley's "Viva Las Vegas" and "Blue Malibu," it feels like every new sitcom on TV is set in Los Angeles, and any record with the word "surf" in the title is selling like hotcakes. It's even had an interesting rebound effect, where some of the rock ‘n' roll and folk bands that these surf rockers admired are achieving a boost in popularity by association.\n\nWhile musicians like Jan & Dean, Dick Dale, the Rip Chords, and Ronny & the Daytonas are enjoying various levels of success across the nation, it is clear that the true winners of this "surfmania" are the Beach Boys. Their celebrity has reached a fever pitch, with legions of devoted fans following the surf rock band's every move. All their concerts have been played to sold-out stadiums packed with screaming fans, they constantly perform on variety shows like The Ed Sullivan Show, any public appearance is followed by a swarm of paparazzi, and their every action is chronicled by dozens of fanzines. Fans in Iowa strap surfboards to their cars, the shouting at the band's concerts is so loud that it's almost impossible to hear them sing, and tens of thousands of teenage girls were rendered inconsolable when Brian Wilson proposed to his girlfriend Marilyn Rovell—because it meant he was out of the dating game.\n\nSome say that this is a collective hysteria sweeping our nation's youth. Others say that it's society's way of processing the recent political upheaval by immersing itself in an idealized form of Americana. Others just think that it's got a really catchy beat. But whatever the reason is, it's clear that surf rock is here to stay."

 USA.culture.38.t:0 "Brian Wilson Retires from Touring"
 USA.culture.38.desc:0 "On New Year's Eve, the Beach Boys performed "Auld Lang Syne" at New York City's Times Square, broadcast as part of Guy Lombardo's annual TV special to millions of homes nationwide. However, it may have been the last time that this lineup of the Beach Boys performs for the foreseeable future.\n\nBrian Wilson, the band's bassist, songwriter, and vocalist, announced this morning at a press conference that he will cease touring with the band, and will instead focus on songwriting and spending time with his wife, Marilyn Rovell Wilson. Wilson's spot on the touring lineup will be replaced by Glen Campbell, a session musician who had previously worked with the Beach Boys, as well as singers like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Phil Spector, and Elvis Presley. Bombarded by questions from the press about whether this had to do with the stress of touring, burnout from releasing three studio albums in a year, or the recent firing of his father Murry Wilson as manager, a visibly uneasy Brian called an end to the conference and quickly departed.\n\nReporters later reached out to Murry, Brian's father, who described Brian's decision as "what always happens when you get too big for your own good," and that his son "needs to get his act together and stop letting this all go to his head." Other members of the band or their representatives at Capitol Records could not be reached for comment."

 USA.culture.39.t:0 "The Beach Boys Release Pet Sounds"
 USA.culture.39.desc:0 "The Beach Boys have done it again, releasing their eleventh album Pet Sounds to both critical and public acclaim. However, fans have noticed something unusual about it: it is a complete break from their regular surf rock style. Electric guitars have been replaced by string sections, lyrics once about sun and sand now talk about love and heartbreak, and the more interesting sound effects include theremins, barking dogs, prepared pianos, and freight train whistles. However, the singers are still the Beach Boys as always, and their vocal arrangements have become even more elaborate and layered. Critics are already making comparisons to Phil Spector, a music producer whose "Wall of Sound" style is immensely influential on Beach Boys frontrunner Brian Wilson.\n\nAlthough critics are split as to whether the album was a failed experiment or a bold new step for music, many of the fans have taken to it eagerly nonetheless. With the sobering events of the past several years, it is little surprise that listeners desire a more emotional and conflicted type of pop music."

 USA.culture.40.desc:0 "After nearly a year of waiting and a three month delay, rock fans across the country are clamoring to get their hands on the Beach Boys' latest album: SMiLE. Those who hoped that the California rock band would return to their surf rock roots are sure to be disappointed, as the album's content doubles down on the baroque and experimental nature of last year's Pet Sounds. There are string sections, banjos, bass harmonicas, recordings of bleating goats, slide whistles, harpsichords, theremins, and more, which combine to make a truly surreal symphonic experience. The rhythms and lyrics bring together folk songs, tone poems, classic Americana, national introspection on our country's sordid past, spiritual epiphanies, and the intertwine of the body and soul!\n\nAt least, that's what some say. Others deride the album as a self-aggrandizing catastrophe made by someone high on LSD and delusions of grandeur. The melodies are muddled and chaotic, and the lyrics range from kitschy ("Vege-tables") to downright nonsensical ("Cabinessence"). The only somewhat enjoyable song on the entire album is "Good Vibrations," which was released as a single by the band back in October and hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWhere fans see esoteric genius, critics see an incomprehensible mess. Where detractors hear the ramblings of an over-drugged burnout, supporters hear the enlightenment of a tortured soul. This embittered back-and-forth between critics has only served to drive more people to buy the album and see what all the fuss is about, propelling it further and further up the charts. Billboard estimates a gold certification is mere weeks away."

 USA.culture.41.desc:0 "Police were called to a house in Los Angeles's Beverly Crest neighborhood this morning after a housekeeper reported that the door was unlocked and she could see bloodstains inside. When they arrived, they discovered one of the most tragic and horrifying mass murders of the decade.\n\nBeach Boys members Brian Wilson, his brother Dennis, and cousin Mike Love were at record producer Terry Melcher's house on March 8th to celebrate the release of their latest album. Also in attendance were Brian's pregnant wife Marilyn, singer Mark Lindsay of the Raiders, and Melcher's mother, movie star Doris Day. During the night of March 8-9th, an unidentified group of people entered the property on foot after cutting the phone lines. Doris Day was leaving the party in her car and must have seen them; the car's front door was open and she was shot four times in the abdomen. The group then gained access to the front door through an open window and brought all the house's inhabitants to the living room. Brian Wilson and Melcher were stabbed multiple times to death, while Marilyn and Lindsay were found shot dead on the back porch, likely attempting to flee. Dennis Wilson's body was far more heinously killed compared to the others: he was shot in both his knees, his abdomen was stabbed over four dozen times, and his face was severely disfigured by blunt trauma. The words "thief" and "pig" were written in blood on the living room walls.\n\nThe only survivor of the event was Mike Love, who endured half a dozen knife wounds and being shot in the shoulder before passing out from blood loss. He is currently comatose in intensive care in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Beverly Hills, and investigators hope he will wake soon and help identify the killers."

 USA.culture.42.t:0 "Beach Boys Ex-Associate Charged in Wilson-Melcher Murders"
 USA.culture.42.desc:0 "This morning, Charles Manson was charged with first degree murder in the aftermath of the terrifying killings that gripped the nation last March. Manson, a self-proclaimed guru with delusions of grandeur and a history of violent sex crimes, met Terry Melcher after a chance encounter with Beach Boys member Dennis Wilson. Wilson, hoping to aid Manson's dream of becoming a published folk musician, introduced him to Melcher, but they had a falling out due to Manson's violent and erratic behavior. Manson was already in LAPD custody for an unrelated petty crime when he was charged. His cult of followers, colloquially known as his "Family," earlier caught the FBI's attention for their leader's support of Francis Parker Yockey and preaching a bizarre synthesis of messianic apocalypticism and white supremacy. When questioned if his beliefs motivated the crime, Manson claimed that the murders were "all personal" and unrelated to his plans to "Wake the World"—his prophesied race war with its name taken from a Beach Boys song. According to Manson, Wilson adapted the lyrics to his song "Cease to Exist" without crediting him and deserved retribution.\n\nA court date is set, and a conviction is all but guaranteed due to band member Mike Love's agreement to testify after emerging from a coma last week. Love also announced that he and bandmates Carl Wilson, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston unanimously agreed to dissolve the band out of respect to Brian and Dennis's memory."
