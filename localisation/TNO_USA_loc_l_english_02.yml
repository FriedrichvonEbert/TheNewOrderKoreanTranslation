He now belongs to history.\n\nChurch bells could be heard ringing across the Reich as the news broke. Adolf Hitler, supreme ruler of the Third Reich, passed away at age 73 in the leadup to his birthday. Previous CIA reports indicated that his health had been failing in recent years, but the crisis of the past years seems to have done him in for good.\n\nIn America, and much of the rest of the world, the mood is in stark contrast to that of Germany. Spontaneous celebrations have broken out In Washington, in New York, in the south, in the west, all across the country. Even in the occupied ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco, American workers and Japanese soldiers agree that Hitler's death is something worth celebration. Publicly, President Nixon has not commented, but privately, he has been reported as 'elated'.\n\nHowever, it does appear that Hitler was the sole thing holding the Reich together. The NSA has intercepted numerous communications from within Germany, indicating that a conflict is imminent.\n\nThere is something more to add.

After his unanimous victory in the 1969 Chess Championship against Bent Larsen of Denmark, he has been considered by many observers as the greatest American grandmaster of all time, and has achieved the highest ELO rating in recorded history. But his brilliancy has not gone without controversy, and the chess community has descended into chaos after he has recently refused to defend his title against Germany.\n\nFollowing his perfect victory in the 1963 US Championship, Fischer has made multiple fascist and pro-German statements, becoming an official member of the extreme right of the National Progressive Party. He has openly described himself as a Yockey, and has made numerous racist statements towards the Japanese and has undergone virulent anti-semitic triades during tournaments, despite him being half-Jewish himself, a label which he passionately rejects. In this year's 1972 Chess Championship, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, he has verbally attacked both the United States and FIDE, culminating in him surrendering the chance for him to play against Klaus Darga of Germany, automatically awarding him the new world champion by default.\n\nHe has answered to the press's questioning with "I refuse to let my name be associated with that of Jewish deceit... I would rather be branded a traitor by you FIDE degenerates than to go against another intellectually superior Aryan of my own blood." It appears as if he will continue to stir discontent if we let him say what he wants to say. What should we do?"

However, upon arrival, he instead entered a government office where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich. After a short internment, the Führer announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and his decision to forfeit from the championship. The rumours of his half-Jewish ancestry seemed to have been overlooked by authorities. He has confirmed to the press that his emigration is permanent, citing recent actions to "silence" him by the American government.\n\nAlthough some are graceful that we will no longer have to deal with that little shit's mouth anymore, the game's community has mourned the loss of our finest player nevertheless. In the Reich, Fischer has been appointed a personal instructor for him to learn Deutsch, and already has current champion Klaus Darga gave him the go-ahead to play with him against the United States in 1975. With no hope in winning FIDE's next competition, this intellectual battlefield, however minor, has been conclusively lost to fascism. What we have sacrificed may have been just a pawn, but every piece matters as the game unfolds..."

Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Bavaria, claiming to have been contested by a local club. However, upon arrival he instead entered a foreign ministry where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich, offering to play for our cause in the future.\n\nUpon being notified of the grandmaster's internment, the Führer has personally announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and appointing him a private instructor for him to learn Deutsch. All those foolish enough to wish to challenge him will now have to do so within our borders. Although there exists rumours that Fischer is half-Jewish himself, we have decided to believe his own claim that he descends from German blood only. In the meantime, Fischer has considered developing his own chess variant for our own people, "Überchess." With Darga agreeing to play with him against the United States in 1975, we are now certain of our dominance over the game's global scene.

If Africa falls, next falls India, then with the east secured, the Nazis will soon be in the Americas as well!\n\nAt least, this is the sentiment that every American general with a foot in the White House door has loudly shouted, berated the Senate over, rallied their troops with and harassed the media with as seemingly every man who has ever held a gun has proclaimed the time for a 'final battle' against the fascist menace.\n\nWhile many members of the Republican-Democrat party have seemed nervous over the situation, proposing some doubts that this 'Domino Theory' is as immediate a threat as proposed, or that entering war with direct servants of the Reich can end in anything besides a greater conflict, it is most surprising that several members of the NPP have stepped across the Senate aisle to agree. Leftists in the NPP have questioned what, exactly, the R-D dominated military establishment proposes as any end goal in this conflict, and what plan they may have to deal with Africa even if there is some sort of victory, while the far right of the party has showed some suspicious hesitance to do battle with the fascists.\n\nRegardless, however, the President seems dead-set on an intervention in the South African conflict, with President Nixon seemingly hoping that a knockout punch on the Reich Commissioners will save his flagging administration and halt the impending impeachment vote."

It seems that our decision to bar all former native cooperators from serving in the new United African army may have backfired. It seems that many of these former native SS members have either joined the ANC, local SS resistance movements or perhaps worst of all, become bandits roving the countryside looting and pillaging as they please.\n\nThe ANC, now exceptionally strengthened and radicalized by the influx of ex-SS members, continues its violent guerilla campaigns against our allies in the region. Worst of all the ANC now enjoys a wide base of support, both from the native African population and whatever is left of the old reichskommissarat forces.\n\nSouth Africa's garrisons have proven ineffective at containing the ANC rebels within their zone of administration. As they are often misled into traps by local African villagers, and despite the harsh reprisals such actions engender they show no signs of stopping. The local regions around South African garrisons are slowly transformed into wastelands patroled by brutal military patrols, for some, it is as the Rechiskommisarats never left.\n\nAs it stands South Africa is slowly taking the place of the old German colonies, both domestically and abroad. Anti-war protests continue, and now focus exclusively on the multitudes of war crimes committed by our supposed allies"

Exiled former President Cheddi Jagan issued a statement..."\n\nA couple dozen people crowd the room. Aides, secretaries, and even a few senators, all sitting in pure silence as the low hum of the television and its tinny speakers recite the unfortunate news. Rogers sighs, deciding he has heard enough. Standing up, he shuffles over to the TV and turns it off.

So far, no one has said a word, aside from a few curt greetings. H.R. Haldeman breaks the palpable silence, "I think we all know why we're here. Our friend in Guyana has gone too far, we need to do something about it."\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, follows Haldeman's lead and speaks next, Nixon still bearing an angry yet contemplative look. "The press doesn't know our involvement in his election. We need to threaten constricting economic ties. Sanctions, condemnations, and diplomatic isola-"\n\n"-frankly, Bob, he'll get trade from somewhere else. Hell, when Germany gets back on its feet we'll all be in trouble because that's where he'll get it from. The Krauts would jump at the chance for an ally right on our doorstep," Kennedy cuts in, his sharp Massachusetts accent grabbing the attention of the room.\n\n"What do you suggest?" McNamara asks.\n\n"Use our clout in the country. Threats, bribes, and blackmail."\n\nMcNamara shakes his head, "No, just apply pressure for him to repeal the act! If we threaten him, he'll double down on his opposition. Any MP of theirs he suspects might turn against him will face retribution. We can't top that, if only for moral reasons."\n\nSlowly the room evolves into conflicting arguments, various cabinet members arguing for an exile army, others for isolation. Suddenly, a voice cuts through the clamor. "That's enough!"\n\nThe head of the table has spoken. Richard Nixon stands, and then speaks, "I don't care about it either way, I just want the press and Burnham, both, to calm the hell down! Force him, pressure him, it doesn't matter.

Only McNamara, Haldeman, Nixon, and Kennedy are in the boardroom.\n\n"Well," McNamara says, "I guess we've got to do it the hard way. Ball's in your court, Jack."\n\n"I'll make the call."\n\nKennedy makes the move to get up, but Nixon raises a hand. Turning around, he scans his eyes over the room, "Who says we have to do anything?"\n\nHaldeman raises an eyebrow, "Dick, he's executing people, we can't let this slide, not with the press on our backs like they are now."\n\n"Since when are we so high and mighty? We've supported men like Burnham in the past, and even if we ignore this, we still have plausible deniability."\n\n"I don't think this is a good idea," Kennedy says, placing a hand on Nixon's shoulder, "I think we owe it to the people of Guyana to help them."\n\nHaldeman looks over to McNamara, who shrugs, "Gotta tell you Bob, I agree with Dick on this one."\n\nHaldeman looks at Nixon, "Well Dick, you're the president.""

The sight alone was more than enough a reward for his work, but he knew that he still had more to do.\n\n"It is often said that a chain is only so strong as its weakest link. So too is a nation only so great as its humblest man. When he and his kindred are stricken, and the nation does not rise to the task of uplifting him, it has effectively split itself in two. It is split between a loud nation of opulence and splendor, and a silent nation of want. For a nation to be great, it must not allow this fractured silence. Four years ago I stood before you and vowed to never allow this silence again, and now you the people stand before me, and you are no longer silent...\n\n...but it is not sufficient for the nation to plaster over the gaps. The cracks must truly be healed, and the inequalities of the nation truly addressed before the spectre can finally be slain. Let us go forth in the interests of the land, and of the people. Let us work to once and for all end want and misery in this country. Let us strive to fulfil the true potential of this nation and allow all to enjoy its bounty. America shall be truly one and indivisible, and never again shall we allow an invisible and impoverished world exist right beneath our noses!"\n\nWild applause greeted his closing remarks. President Harrington smiled, but he knew that words alone could not move a nation. Four years had been spent doing precisely what he had warned against, his efforts a mere bandage over the wound of want. Now he had four more years, and he had to make them count. Poverty's grip over the other America had been weakened - now was the time to cut it loose forever."

Over the recent weeks there have been significantly fewer instances of politically or racially motivated violence, and rallies in major Southern cities, both pro and anti-segregation, have markedly fewer marchers.

 USA.1802.desc:0 "Embers have turned to ashes in the North's largest cities. In Chicago, firefighters ended the last of the blazes that had consumed the west side and the mayor suspended a curfew. In Washington D.C. over $15 million in property damage has been accounted for, but order has largely been restored. Baltimore, where citizen's anger may have burned the hottest, has concluded its extraordinary use of heavily armed federal troops.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out over President Nixon's use of the veto against civil rights legislation are slowly starting to die down, as a combination of apathy and repression slows their inertia. As the dust settles, historians and political scientists are examining the possibility that this outpouring of discontent marks the greatest social upheaval since the Civil War. Even as the violence on the street is decreasing rhetorical violence is increasing.\n\nMany Civil Rights moderates are outraged, but are afraid of being tied to the riots by future electoral opponents. A broader swath of opposition, from liberal Republicans to the NPP-Left, are decrying Nixon as the tyrant envisioned by the Founders. An open letter signed by a bevy of top academics castigated the Republican party for falling in with segregationists and cast the veto as the ugly vow of the unholy union between R and D. All signatories promised to leave the party and encourage others to do so as well. It's clear that the veto of the Civil Rights Act has hardened its proponents, and divided the country even further.

 USA.1803.desc:0 "In 1877, US Congressmen reached a compromise that resolved the disputed Presidential election of 1876 by giving the Presidency to Rutherford B. Hayes in return for ending Reconstruction and permitting the establishment of Jim Crow laws. Almost a century later, these laws stand unchanged across much of the South. Few thought the seventies would be a decade where the Allman Brothers Band were banned from performing in their home state, where the Negro Motorist Green Book would surpass 40 years of publication, and where men and women of separate races still face criminal prosecution for falling in love. Yet, thanks to decades of federal ambivalence to this injustice, and failure to pass a lasting Civil Rights Act, have allowed our nation's greatest shame to endure.\n\nBlack America's fury at their continued oppression has reached a boiling point. With Reverend King and his principles of nonviolent resistance being dead for almost a decade, many Blacks have turned to violence, organized or disorganized, as the only viable form of resistance. Segregated department stores hire armed guards to protect against vandalism, and Southern police have become increasingly militarized in order to quash the near-monthly riots in Black neighborhoods. In reaction, Southern Whites have been flocking to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist militias in order to brutalize Blacks who protest injustice. The Left-NPP declares themselves the only political force who truly fights for racial justice, Yockey claims to be the one man who can save White America from lawlessness, and many take their word for it.\n\nIf America does not make any progress on this crisis, it will only further deteriorate. We may just be forced to choose between the survival of segregation, or of our nation."

 USA.1901.desc:0 "Like all organised crime establishments the anonymous room in Queens had the smell of cash, and cigarettes, and too many secrets whispered into waiting drywall. The men within paced about and spoke at length on the subjects one would expect; a laundering here, a fiefdom issue there, the latest quotas from the bosses. Everybody knew enough to make sure they didn't leave the wrong words hanging in the air for the wrong ears: shibboleths sprouted in the smoky mist. The Genovese branch of the Mafia hadn't clung to their yellowed halls of power on the East Coast by playing stupid. They certainly weren't going to start now.\n\nThe struggle at present wasn't one of power, but of its old friend, money. The New York joints had been busted up for a long while, and for a time the patrons had settled for what they could get. Depression years and the chaos of the Fifties had a way of killing any uptown pretensions. But now that America was recovering the old middle-class patrons were beginning to filter out, and ones even the Cosa Nostra deemed distasteful were moving in to take their place. The pimps were losing control of the situation on home turf. Something had to be done.\n\nAntony, Joe and Mark (not their real names) fiddled with the map of South Avenue on the table. A new joint, free of the putrid smell of the Old Town, would jazz up the revenues and act as a movement point for money, guns, information. Old trades, new venue, easy money. But who would frequent it? It wasn't exactly Broadway.\n\nAntony smiled. His next words would change history, even if he didn't actually know it yet."

Left and left and right and left again, a swirl of the body so sweeping it belongs on the parade square, not the rough tiles of the inn floor. Then the shoes opposite him trace the contours in lithe slips and end up in their original placing (by some arcane coincidence).\n\nMartin glares at him with visible annoyance. John looks down in sheepishness. The moment stretches taut, pulls apart and snaps. Martin bursts out laughing, tickled by something on John's face, and pulls him to himself. His face smells of smoke and aftershave.\n\nThe kiss is tart and startling in the dim neon. John pulls back with the old instincts of the Brooklyn boy who always knew how much of himself to show, and how much to hide. But today a part of him resists, and instead he stays. It's a raw comfort, and in the glittering sharpness of the moment it's all he has.\n\nMartin pulls away with some reluctance. The date has been brief, and even this hour has been snatched at great cost. They haven't much time. He takes John's arm and together they spin out of the little bar, their little dance studio. Their figures are quickly lost in the chaos and brilliance of the New York night, blending in neon-shaded phantoms before disappearing."

 USA.1903.desc:0 "It's a quiet night in the Stonewall Inn. Barely anyone notices my scribbling notes in the corner; this corner of America is obscure, but it shares the tendency for aching introspection, abbreviated loneliness hammered out via cheap glass cups. Beyond the occasional whisper and the wordless glances, not much makes it out of the haze of anonymity, and long may it remain so - the haze is the only thing that separates this part of town from the moralizing glaze of the rest of America. It's the only thing that keeps it safe.\n\nAs I'm writing this, a pair of young men (in their twenties, perhaps?), one Latino, one Caucasian, are swerving to the aching beat of "Satisfaction". Their patterned shoes tap out a rhythm at once familiar and strange; just irregular enough to inject vitality while keeping pace with the beat. Their bodies trace patterns so bold they'd be scandalous anywhere else, but here in the trace of lips and hands on waists it achieves careworn familiarity, like an elderly seamstress fixing an old cardigan. If this had been a different country perhaps they would have become dancers. But the lipstick and the gaudy dresses they wear would kill their careers, and a lot more besides, in this one. America is home to the brave, but this land isn't free, not for some. Not yet.\n\nFor now there is the freedom of the swirl and curve of dance, the celebration of the joy of life in a world with so little else. Another man offers his hand, and I rise to dance. In the gentle rhythm and the smoky swirls I sense some vast and gentle ecstasy, and with every sway I come closer to its source."

 USA.1904.desc:0 "The Stonewall Inn is a spot of light and loud laughter in a world slipping into autumn. The sounds of occasional retching aside, the Inn is a good place, and the crowds know it to be far more than just a building. For many of its patrons it's the only place they can truly be themselves. But autumn is sweeping in, one chill breeze at a time.\n\nThe signs have been there for a long while; the Mayor's riding on the coattails of the Moral Cleanup movement sweeping the country, and the officers sent to do the collection duties (one calls it the offering bag, with only a hint of irony) from the Inn tell the bartenders of the Anti-Mafia Team they're forming in the back of the Metropolitan Department. It's not like the community they've formed here hasn't known the wrath of the cops, but this time it'll be different. Change is coming to America, as the President says over the airwaves, but some changes are less welcome than others.\n\nThe bartender methodically cleans his cups half an hour before closing time: he'll take care of the mess in the toilets afterwards (and there is always a mess in the toilets). He got hired by the Don same as all the staff, but he's come to love the place. The patrons are gaudy and have a glint in their eyes, but it's a real life they're living here in the damp spaces.\n\nHe looks at a sleeping customer hunched over his cups and smiles wanly. Whatever happens next, he'll stay with the ship, even if the hull's leaking. His passengers deserve nothing less."

The four undercover officers curse as they fiddle with the switches, and the lights flicker back to life. The few who realise what is about to happen begin pushing their way through the crowd, but the Morals Squad have already locked down the window exits and are marching through the doors, flashlights in hand, as they bust the biggest gay establishment in New York.\n\nThe raid doesn't meet with a receptive crowd, to say the least: As officers lead those in women's clothing to the toilets many resist. It's common knowledge that those who get arrested by the Morals Squad as cross-dressing men don't make it out without bruises, spit-drenched faces, manhandling. Men with faces lean and caked with makeup wrestle with their cuffs and spit on their captors. None of the bar's patrons have made it this far in a world which mostly despises them without getting a little rough around the edges, and when the Man pushes them around they push right back.\n\nBy the time the raid concludes about 150 people are under arrest. But more are gathering in the late-night darkness of the Big Apple, and a storm is brewing that cannot be contained."

 USA.1906.t:0 "We Shall Overcome"
 USA.1906.desc:0 "The greatest LGBT riot in the history of the United States begins with a logistics problem. The Morals Police have grabbed 28 cases of beer and 19 kegs of hard liquor, but with the patrol vans occupied elsewhere they have nowhere to put it. Instead they keep the patrons on lockdown as the wagons arrive, far too slowly for a police operation. The patrons, of course, are understandably upset, and those few not under arrest quickly join the growing crowds gathered outside the building. Many of them know that once the Inn dies, so too does the living, breathing heart of gay culture in the Greatest City in the World. They have everything to lose.\n\nAs Mafia members and patrons are loaded onto the wagons, many still struggling, a lone voice breaks out. 'We Shall Overcome', a protest song written for the South African War, finds receptive ears in another angry crowd facing another unwinnable fight. Growing cheers, growling, shouts of "Gay Power!" echo from the crowds, which have swelled to bursting in the street. Stormé Delarverie falls to the floor struggling against four officers, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nRecords are unclear what exactly happens next: in a wave of anger, the mob pushes over police wagons, hurls bricks at the officers retreating into Stonewall, presses garbage against the broken windows. Many of the most repressed members of the gay community lead the riot - the drag queens and the street boys, leading a wild, wild charge. Sylvia Rivera, notable drag queen, will remember it as "the greatest night of her life". The doors of the Inn are broken open with a battering ram. Officers inside prepare for a fiery last stand.\n\nAnd then the police trucks arrive."

 USA.1907.desc:0 "The initial reaction is one of rage. Officers bloody and coated with garbage, an inn wrecked with violence - and the fairies did it. The fairies. Violence explodes on the streets as police officers take the law into their own hands, and hammer their rage onto the defenceless. The mob arrayed against them is far too far gone to care. They form the rough outline of a cabaret chorus line and begin to sing. Their voices are piercing in the late night, and the police have had enough of being needled - they rush the line.\n\nMen and women get hammered with nightsticks as bedlam spreads to the surrounding streets. Crowds run around police officers, laughing gaily like warriors in the light of burning cars. By the time the riots come to a halt, Christopher Street is blocked, half the cars on it are overturned and every garbage can for a mile around has been emptied into the street. Witnesses describe an odd beauty to the refuse-strewn street, like a river of broken toys.\n\nOf course, the streets aren't the only thing breaking the news: all through the next day crowds gawk at the burnt-out shell of Stonewall, and when the next night comes the they are joined by songwriters, poets, activists and tourists washing down the streets in a tide of exuberant energy. Allen Ginsberg notes, on the way back, that "the guys there were so beautiful-they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10 years ago.""

Though we could not stage direct attacks in the Home Islands nor in China, we have pinpointed various locations where we can start breaking down the Sphere from within. Let's begin with a nation that many of our great-grandfathers are familiar with.\n\nThe Philippines. These islands were the spoils of our victory over the Spanish Empire in 1898, and they stayed with us until the Second World War saw them forcefully ripped away from our influence. The Japanese preyed on the inhabitants ever since, spawning dozens of pro-democratic rebel groups that we could lend aid to. Their close proximity to the Japanese island may prove to be useful if we can get the Filipinos on our side.\n\nVietnam. The Vietnamese have been oppressed since the dawn of French colonialism, and the handing over of Vietnam to Japan only made matters worse for the natives. This could be our opportunity to introduce democracy and let Vietnam be ruled by Vietnamese for the first time in centuries. Vietnam could also be a gateway to India or even China itself if we succeed.\n\nIndonesia. These islands provide a large bulk of the Sphere's resources, mainly oil, rubber, and a hefty worker population. If we operate in Indonesia and persuade them to rebel against their Japanese overlords, the economy of the Sphere would suffer incredible damage. There would be shortages across East Asia, and it may cause other members of the Sphere to renounce their membership, further pressuring the Empire of Japan."

Marshall, a graduate of Howard Law School and an experienced civil rights litigator, would be the first African-American to serve on the highest court in the land. His appointment would surely mark a turning point in American history. However, some in Congress are not so willing to see such a point turn in the first place.\n\nMany Senators come from the South, and are directly reliant on white voter blocs who aren't well-disposed towards putting a black man on the Supreme Court. Several members of the Senate have already put out statements to the press expressing their firm opposition, although nobody has come out and said that it would be due to Marshall's race. Instead, the releases mentioned the dangers of "liberal judicial activism", and other such phrases. Clearly, the appointment of Thurgood Marshall will be a political fight for the ages."

In a decisive vote in the Senate today, Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as the newest Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court. Justice Marshall will be the first African-American to serve on the court, and his confirmation is undoubtedly a victory for the Civil Rights Movement, which he himself has worked tirelessly to advance.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, a number of conservative senators railed against "judicial activism", and made a variety of statements that many commentators have called little better than dog whistles. Some even asked whether or not Marshall had ties to "American Bolsheviks". This strategy failed, however. At a press conference today, Justice Marshall stated his gratitude to the Senate, and to the people of America, before posing for pictures with his two sons and his wife, the civil rights activist Cecilia Suyat Marshall.\n\nThis is a truly historic moment for the nation, representing the triumph of justice over institutional racism!"
 USA_sen_bill.105_fail:0 "Following the nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court, one southern senator was reported to have claimed:\n\n"We will fight this nomination all the way-until hell freezes over, and then we'll skate across on the ice."\n\nIt would appear that, as of today, that fight had succeeded. Two weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to have Marshall's nomination proceed to the Senate floor, but with the recommendation that it be rejected. This was seen by many as a death knell for the appointment, but still, our whips persisted in trying to gather the necessary votes. They failed. In a tight vote, the Senate rejected Marshall's nomination, led by a large bloc of reactionary southerners.\n\nAs observers sat stunned by the rejection of the man who would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, some in the White House were already drafting plans for a response. The next name on the shortlist is the fairly conservative Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Let's hope that he makes it."

#Nixon
USA_John_F_Kennedy_dep_desc:0 "------------\nAs the eldest son of former President Joseph P. Kennedy, John Fitzgerald Kennedy is the heir to a troubled political legacy in America - and has the charisma and bearing to remain unbowed regardless. As one of the last progressive Democrats on the East Coast, Kennedy was a natural political pick for Richard Nixon's presidential ticket in 1960, promising to bring together the dour Republican from California with a charming, progressive East Coast Democrat.\n\nUnfortunately, governing would prove to be a harder challenge than campaigning for both President Nixon and Vice President Kennedy, with the Vice President frequently outshining his superior in public appearances and on Capitol Hill - most recently serving as the President's envoy to the Japanese during the Hawaiian Missile Crisis. The American public's adulation of Kennedy has not endeared him to President Nixon, and the relationship between the two men - and their wings of the party - have cooled noticeably."

USA_William_P_Rogers_pol_desc:0 "------------\nWilliam Rogers can be said to be one of the few men in President Nixon's cabinet to have been appointed specifically for their lack of expertise in their portfolio - as a way for the President himself to dominate foreign policy. While Rogers is a talented and respected legal mind - serving as President Eisenhower's Attorney General - President Nixon has repeatedly expressed his interest in leading foreign policy personally, and without influence from within the R-D's. Rogers has served as an uninspired Secretary of State to date, frequently overruled or even kept out of the loop by President Nixon."

USA_Robert_McNamara_eco_desc:0 "------------\nRobert McNamara is an outside appointment in President Nixon's cabinet - coming from industry rather than the political class. A veteran of the Army Air Force during World War II, McNamara entered government after over a decade of service as one of the Ford Motor Company's 'Whiz Kids' - turning the company around through the revolutionary application of a statistical and scientific approach to management and business. In poaching McNamara from his position as President of Ford in 1960, Nixon hopes to transplant McNamara's methods from the boardrooms of Detroit to the smoke-filled rooms of Washington D.C.\n\nNixon offered McNamara a choice between the Defense and Treasury portfolios - and while McNamara is officially Secretary of the Treasury, he frequently weighs in on issues of defense, building a network of connections that could see him rise higher in Washington, should he so desire..."

USA_Melvin_Laird_mil_desc:0 "------------\nMelvin Laird is a respected congressman from Wisconsin, having served in Congress since 1953 as a member of the House Appropriations Committee specializing in defense budget and procurement issues. Though well-versed in defense affairs - advocating for a gradual reorientation of American force structure to support a defensive posture with OFN allies - Laird continually fights to defend his portfolio against Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, who pushes for a more statistical and results-driven approach to a more assertive defense policy.\n\nFinding his own position in question in the Nixon administration and with his talents increasingly used purely for Congressional affairs, Laird has expressed his desire to run again for the House of Representatives in 1964, potentially setting up a race to succeed him in the Nixon Administration."

#Bennett
USA_Gerald_Ford_dep_desc:0 "------------\nVice President Gerald Ford was largely unknown outside Washington in 1964 - but, among Washington's powerbrokers, his selection as President Bennett's running mate came as little surprise. Leveraging a decorated record of military service in WWII to win a seat in the House of Representatives from Michigan, Ford eschewed the publicity stunts or blatant politicking of many of his colleagues, instead serving as one of the key go-betweens within the Republican-Democratic Party in the years after its merger - earning a reputation as a 'Congressman's congressman' in the process.\n\nAs a respected military officer with over a decade of service in the House and with a sterling reputation for integrity and fairness among his colleagues, Ford was a natural fit to Bennett's promise of stability and reconciliation after the tumultuous Nixon years. Ford's support for civil rights and liberalism also helped seal Bennett's support in the North, despite his fiscal conservatism being more in line with Bennett's own views."

USA_Absalom_Robertson_eco_desc:0 "------------\nSecretary of the Treasury Absalom Robertson is a lawyer by training and a experienced legislator in his own right - but with hardly the finance or business experience that would suggest he would be a fit for running the Treasury. But like much of the Bennett Administration, Robertson's appointment to a high position in the Cabinet reflects a recognition of political reality.\n\nThe R-Ds remain, fundamentally, a coalition of two different parties operating in different parts of the United States, and Robertson's devout Christianity, his connections to Virginia's Byrd Organization, and his conservative stance on Civil Rights all proved essential in fighting the '64 election in the South. And for his efforts, Robertson and his wing of Democrats have been rewarded handsomely - being tasked with designing and implementing the Silver Act, a major shift in American economic policy aimed at ending the country's postwar malaise."

#Johnson
USA_Edmund_Muskie_dep_desc:0 "------------\nEdmund Sixtus Muskie cuts an unusual figure as one of the leading champions of liberalism within the Democratic Party in New England, when many other Democrats come from the South or the more conservative Midwestern states. A pugnacious and combative legislator, Muskie and then-Senator Johnson had more than their fair share of clashes on the Senate floor in the 1950's. However, his commitment to advancing civil rights and American liberalism - much like the late John F. Kennedy - made him the natural running mate for President Johnson, a Democrat he could count on to advance the vision of the Great Society.\n\nBeyond his accumulated experience in the Senate and its Northern members, Muskie is also a passionate advocate for environmental causes, often claiming to supporters that he would pick up the mantle of Theodore Roosevelt's conservation efforts - a claim that won him some support in the West, but has met more skepticism in Washington as the President advances his other priorities."

USA_Henry_Fowler_eco_desc:0 "------------\nHenry Fowler brings a lifetime's worth of experience in law, public policy, and financial affairs to the Johnson Administration, despite never having held elected office of his own. Following his graduation from Yale Law School in 1932, Fowler is best known for having defended the constitutionality of public works programs to combat the Great Depression, and then for serving as a senior legal advisor to the War Production Board during WWII, gaining familiarity with the business of how America built and paid for its war machine.\n\nFollowing America's defeat, Fowler became a key member of the Eisenhower administration after the merger of the Republican and Democratic parties, leveraging his experience in the war to oversee the linking of the newly-founded OFN's economic and military policies. Now, after nearly twenty years in government, President Johnson has called on Fowler to provide a steady hand at the Treasury - which will surely be needed, if the cost of Johnson's Great Society are anywhere near as high as estimated..."

USA_Robert_McNamara_mil_desc:0 "------------\nRobert McNamara is an unusual holdover appointment from Richard Nixon's cabinet - shifting laterally from his position as Secretary of the Treasury to Defense. Given President Johnson's stated focus on improving America at home, the going assumption is that President Johnson is willing to keep the business of national defense in proven hands - and McNamara had already been involved in defense issues beyond his portfolio during the Nixon years.\n\nWith the appointment of Henry Fowler to the Treasury, President Johnson has handed control over the budget and defense to experienced technocrats, with the clear expectation that they will take care of business while Johnson remakes America. McNamara, no doubt, is capable and willing to serve Johnson as he did Nixon - but with his growing network of connections in Washington, McNamara is now a political fixture in his own right, and some whisper that his ambition may soon extend to the White House itself."

#RFK
USA_Hubert_Humphrey_dep_desc:0 "------------\nFew people are as qualified for their job as Hubert Humphrey, vice president of the United States of America.\n\nHumphrey has been in politics for decades, and his entire career is one big progressive accomplishment after another. He founded the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party and laid the groundwork for turning the state into the bastion of social democracy it is today, he founded the Peace Corps to aid the most vulnerable nations, and he has always been a strict antifascist willing to go as far as to jail those who wish to subvert the republic with their toxic ideology. It is said that the vice president is only one heartbeat away from the highest office - and if something terrible would happen, Hubert Humphrey would be a more than suitable replacement for Robert F. Kennedy."

USA_Maurine_Neuberger_eco_desc:0 "------------\nWhen people hear “Secretary of Treasury”, they usually don’t imagine a female teacher with a Bachelor of Arts - and yet, Maurine Neuberger defied all expectations and made history by becoming the first woman holding one of the most important offices of the United States.\n\nHer climb to the top has been a long and arduous one. Coming from an unassuming middle class family, she lived a normal life teaching high school kids until she met the love of her life, Richard Neuberger. As a senator, he had the political connections she needed to kickstart her own career - and due to her incredible talent, she rose through the ranks at a breakneck speed. In 1950, she became a representative, in 1960 a senator, and in 1964, she got invited to be a member of Robert F. Kennedy’s cabinet. The future is bright for Maurine Neuberger, and many are already convinced that her illustrious career won’t stop here."

#Thurmond
USA_Maxwell_Taylor_dep_desc:0 "------------\nGeneral Maxwell Davenport Taylor doesn’t know why he was appointed Vice President of the United States. He never ran for office, nor did he publicly take a political position in his life. He certainly isn’t a segregationist like Thurmond, and would have happily used the army to enforce desegregation had previous Presidents given him the order. He accepted Thurmond’s request to fill Humphrey’s office, but still struggles to comprehend why Thurmond would want an apolitical airborne cavalry commander to preside over the US Senate.\n\nYet, perhaps a man with no political ambition is exactly the sort of piece Thurmond needs on his side of the board. Taylor doesn’t understand Thurmond’s political goals, nor does he try to figure them out. He is grateful for the prestige of the position, and will gladly vote as Thurmond requires when tie-breaking is needed. Like a rook castling a king, Taylor can make his master safer and give him a slight edge in the game of politics. Soon, Taylor may cast the decisive vote that fulfills Thurmond’s ultimate ambition."

#Wallace
USA_Curtis_LeMay_dep_desc:0 "------------\nIt is unsurprising that a man that has already influenced the Cold War as much as Curtis LeMay finds himself in a leading role again. Responsible for developing the US Air Force's nuclear doctrine during his leadership of Strategic Air Command, LeMay's tenure as Chief of the Air Force was significantly less influential due to constant conflict with Vice President Kennedy and General Maxwell Taylor. His request to bomb Japanese missile sites in Hawaii was sternly denied, and led to ostracization followed by an extremely public resignation during the Guyana intervention.\n\nLeMay's fire did not diminish on the campaign trail, stating America was capable of "bombing Africa back to the Stone Age" and becoming a major headache for the Wallace campaign. Since the beginning of the campaign he has remained notably silent on almost every issue not related to national security. If Wallace's turbulent presidency ends suddenly, it is anyone's guess what policies his successor would enact."

USA_J_William_Fulbright_pol_desc:0 "------------\nIf George Wallace is the personification of firebrand Southern populist politics, then J. William Fulbright embodies the South at its most genteel. A Rhodes Scholar, former university president, and the son of two of Arkansas' captains of finance, Fulbright is educated, cosmopolitan, well-connected, and far more comfortable at a state dinner than a state fair.\n\nFulbright is the OFN's staunchest advocate, and perhaps the world's last true believer in a multilateral international order. Fulbright envisions America as the guiding light for the free world, the last beacon of liberty in a sea of tyranny. He supports funding student exchange programs between the United States and other nations and spoke up in defense of these programs when they were criticized during the Grey Scare. Fulbright wants the OFN to expand its membership, even to nations following dramatically different ideologies, and forge a friendlier and more peaceable world.\n\nYet, Fulbright is still a Dixiecrat. He broke with the Democratic Party when Thurmond led the exodus in the wake of Brown v. Board. He voted against Nixon's Civil Rights Act after trying to filibuster it. He is a proud member of the Far-Right bloc, and campaigned vigorously for Wallace in his home state. If Fulbright sees a contradiction between being a champion of peace and international cooperation abroad and defending Jim Crow at home, he doesn't show it. In that respect, there is no better choice than him to be Wallace's Secretary of State."

USA_Wilbur_Mills_eco_desc:0 "------------\nWilbur Mills was a natural pick for Wallace's Treasury Secretary. As a county judge, he set up a county-funded healthcare plan for the poor in his home state of Arkansas. As chairman of the House's Ways and Means Committee, the former banker was an expert in the tax code and a master of balancing fiscal conservatism with humanitarian goals. As a segregationist and one of Thurmond's Dixiecrat defectors to the NPP, Mills naturally falls into alignment with Wallace's social policies. Moreover, he is the strongest supporter and chief architect of Wallace's Social Security and Medicare initiatives. If anyone can find room in the budget to help the little guy, it's Mills.\n\nOutside of Mills' political life, the man is an enigma. His intense secrecy about his personal life has fueled rumors of binge drinking and wild parties with the Beltway's sultriest strippers. Whatever the truth of these rumors, Wallace will have to keep an eye on Mills and make sure he doesn't drag this administration into a torrid scandal."

USA_Robert_Byrd_mil_desc:0 "------------\nThere is no member of the Wallace Administration, aside from the man himself, that American progressives loathe more than Robert C. Byrd. The former Senator got his start in politics as an organizer for the Ku Klux Klan, and it was the Grand Dragon of West Virginia who mentored him to run for office. Byrd would earn a reputation as a vitriolic segregationist; he attempted to filibuster the 1962 Civil Rights Act by speaking for a full 14 hours. He once wrote that, "Rather I should die a thousand times and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds."\n\nFor some time, there had been rumors that Byrd was tempering his segregationist views to move closer to the political mainstream. All hopes of that were dashed as he doubled down on his segregationist politics following the election of George Wallace. In contrast to more moderate voices like Fulbright or Mills, Byrd has gone "all-in" on racial segregation. This has earned him a post in Wallace's cabinet, and he has used his new position to become Jim Crow's top advocate in the Executive Branch. With racial politics that are just barely to the left of Yockey's American National Vanguard, Byrd is sure to hold Wallace's feet to the fire if he doesn't go through with repealing the Civil Rights Act."

#Goldwater
USA_Nelson_Rockefeller_dep_desc:0 "------------\nNelson Rockefeller is the gin to Barry Goldwater’s tonic water. He’s the compromise offered to the liberal wing of the Republican-Democrat party, a promise that the Goldwater administration would steer a more centrist course instead of going all-in on conservatism.\n\nHowever, that little olive branch might come back to haunt Goldwater. Rockefeller is more than an empty suit - ever since his governorship of New York, he has been an untarnished paragon of liberalism within the Republican-Democrat party. He would be the first one to put his foot down if Goldwater stept over the line, no matter what the repercussions may be. For nearly all of modern history, the vice president has been little more than a glorified yes-man, and it is still unclear how the political system will handle the stress of two diametrically opposed candidates attempting to work together as one."

USA_Donald_Regan_eco_desc:0 "------------\nFew systems are as complex as the economy. For hundreds of years, economists have been trying to decipher what keeps the world spinning - and for the man hours spent, the results are mediocre at best. America is a bloated mess filled with obscure regulations, overbearing taxes, nonsensical clauses and much more.\n\nDonald Regan is poised to clean up that mess and turn the rusty old engine into a fine-tuned machine. As a former Merrill Lynch executive, he has first-hand experience with the inner workings of the American economy, and over the years, he forged his solution on how to fix it. His bold plans will transfer every level of American society, and people are cautiously awaiting the results of his daring experiment."

USA_Robert_McNamara_mil_gold_desc:0 "------------\nThe military is no place for emotions. Fierce, pathos-filled born-and-bred warriors are as obsolete as the trebuchet, replaced by an endless flood of cool and calculating administrators. Optimizing the logistic process to ensure an uninterrupted delivery of materiel to operational theaters may not be the yearn heroic tales are spun of, but modern warfare is all about percentages, statistics, and evidence-based decisions.\n\nRobert McNamara is the undisputed master of this theorem. Instead of wasting his valuable time on irrelevant conflicts, he does whatever is necessary to strengthen America’s position on an international stage. At Ford, he was pivotal in transforming the corporation into the fine-tuned highly efficient machine it is today - and now, he intends to apply his principles to the military of the United States. A few members of the old guard fervently object to that, claiming that cars cannot be compared to soldiers under any circumstances. McNamara vows to prove them wrong."

#Glenn
USA_Al_Gore_Sr_dep_desc:0 "------------\nAlbert Gore is a rare example of a Southern Democrat that refuses to endorse segregation - having bucked the example set by many of his colleagues in both the R-Ds and the NPP. Having served as Tennessee's senator since 1952 in an upset against the state's machine politics, Gore increasingly found himself out of step with his colleagues as opposition to Civil Rights tore through the Democratic Party across the South, even as his Western colleagues began to rally around Barry Goldwater's call for smaller, limited government.\n\nWhen John Glenn - then the Republican Governor of Ohio - needed a running mate for his bid for the presidency in 1968, Gore was one of the few Democrats left who was palatable to the Civil Rights supporters in the Republican Party and to Glenn's insistence on a large role for the state in public life. Gore, seeing his own political future in Tennessee drawing to a close, chose to stake his career on the political neophyte - serving as Glenn's emissary to Capitol Hill and a key source for policy expertise."

USA_Nelson_Rockefeller_pol_desc:0 "------------\nOne would be hard-pressed to find a politician with a pedigree as illustrious as Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller - scion of the Rockefeller oil dynasty and a long-serving Senator from New York. As one of the leading lights within the liberal Northeastern wing of the Republican Party, Rockefeller (and his fellow Senator, Jacob Javits) had been an early ally of President John Glenn, with Glenn frequently seeking out both Rockefeller and Javits' counsel during his term as Governor of Ohio. \n\nThough Rockefeller was out of contention to be Glenn's Vice President, Glenn immediately announced that Rockefeller would be his Secretary of State days after his electoral victory. Rockefeller accepted - showing to both America and the world that the Rockefellers would once again leave their mark on history."

USA_Jacob_Javits_eco_desc:0 "------------\nBorn in the Lower East Side of New York City to Jewish parents, Jacob Javits has a long career as one of the Republican Party's most liberal voices in Congress. After working to pay his way through both his undergraduate and law degrees, Javits entered politics in the 1930's with the Republicans in order to reject Tammany Hall's machine politics in New York - doing so with aplomb in the wave of Republican victories following WWII. \n\nAfter transitioning from the House to the Senate in the late 1950's, Javits found himself serving alongside the equally liberal Nelson Rockefeller. Despite their vastly different upbringings, Javits and Rockefeller worked exceptionally effectively as a team, and both were quick to welcome John Glenn to politics. President Glenn repaid Javits for his support by nominating him as Secretary of the Treasury - leaving the high offices of state in capable hands as Glenn prepares to take America back to the stars."

#Harrington
USA_Irving_Howe_dep_desc:0 "------------\nEnacting sweeping changes requires a certain degree of ideological purity, and few people are as ideologically pure as Irving Howe. Howe spent his entire life as an influential advocate for democratic socialism, paving the way for the success of quite a few left-wing politicians like Harrington himself. His contributions to socialist newspapers such as the Partisan Review were instrumental in radicalizing young people with nothing more than a fleeting interest in politics, and his involvement in organizations like the Independent Socialist League ensured that the unfocused actionism of these freshly minted activist got funneled into a highly efficient network with nationwide sway.\n\nHowe and Harrington have been close friends for years, and these two leading the nation together is a natural development of their long and fruitful relationship.They won the election, and now they are about to face their greatest challenge yet - the administration of the United States of America."

USA_William_Winter_mil_desc:0 "------------\nRacial integration is the most important issue of our time, and none other than William Winter is better equipped to tackle this monumental challenge. Winter, a highly decorated WWII veteran, has a long history of attempting to end the racial divide between black and white soldiers. During his service as an officer during the Philippines campaign, he distinguished himself by being one of the few white officers who treated their black subordinates as more than disposable cannon fodder. This drew the ire of quite a few of his peers, who viewed that as a crass and obscene violation of traditional military protocols - but eventually, history proved Winter right, as Harrington noticed his long list of accomplishments and decided to offer him a spot in his cabinet.\n\nThe people might support the Harrington administration, but the military is still torn about whether to support or to oppose an actively left-wing politician. Only time will tell if Winter will manage to pacify these incendiary voices or get swept away by them."

#MCS
USA_Spiro_Agnew_dep_desc:0 "------------\nWhen Spiro Agnew first sought a career in politics, the senior partner at his Maryland law firm told him to renounce the Democrats and join the NPP, where young, competent members were in short supply. This advice paid off for him when he was selected as a vice presidential compromise candidate despite being only on his sixth year in the House. On the campaign trail he deviated to right-wing populism with a number of racially charged remarks.\n\nHowever, Agnew's promotion of the "suburban ethic" has proven popular on both sides of the aisle, and his political star is only rising further. Under Margaret Chase Smith, Agnew has become a useful broker of influence in Congress and is widely seen as a good conservative counterpart for her with a bright future of his own."

USA_Jeane_Kirkpatrick_pol_desc:0 "------------\nJeane Duane Kirkpatrick, like her Commander-in-Chief, is a woman with more strength than the men who have surrounded her all her life. Originally a socialist from Oklahoma, Kirkpatrick dropped her socialist beliefs and shifted to a hardline anti-fascist stance while earning a doctorate in political science from Columbia. With a heart with no holes to bleed and a mind composed of little more than sharp wit and hard pragmatism, Kirkpatrick has rocketed herself to the position of Secretary of State for the Smith Administration.\n\nWhile, at face value, she seems an obvious choice for Smith's anti-Japanese positions, Kirkpatrick's appointment was actually a matter of some debate. Kirkpatrick, to put it mildly, takes anti-fascist and anti-Japanese doctrines to a whole new level. She advocates what is now commonly being called the "Kirkpatrick Doctrine": a geopolitical precept that America should support friendly dictatorships in order to prevent the spread of Nazi totalitarianism. This hawkish stance, advocated by some members of the NPP like Scoop Jackson, has occasionally put her at odds with the president. With such extreme views, one wonders how far Kirkpatrick will go to further them, at home and abroad."

USA_John_Stennis_mil_desc:0 "------------\nJohn Stennis is, after Strom Thurmond and George Wallace, one of the most influential leaders of the Far Right NPP's Southern wing. Formerly a prosecutor for the State of Mississippi, Stennis credits his political awakening to the storm of anti-Democratic sentiment that swept America in the aftermath of America's defeat, quickly becoming one of the NPP's primary political organizers in the South, rallying the masses to the cause of preserving racial segregation.\n\nWhere Thurmond leads the NPP nationwide and Wallace canvasses the South as a self-styled defender of white America, Stennis has carved out a niche as a policy specialist, serving as an expert on defense issues and ensuring that the South has a voice in a debate otherwise dominated by Henry Jackson from the Center - and Margaret Chase Smith from the North. When Smith was elected President in 1968, Stennis was the obvious choice to ensure Cabinet unity within Far Right - a man who would bolster Smith's credentials with the South and the expertise to carefully manage her ambitious military reforms at the Pentagon."

USA_Maxwell_Taylor_mil_desc:0 "------------\nFollowing the tragic death of Secretary of Defense John Stennis, and the resulting diplomatic crisis with Japan, the Smith Administration desperately needs to look tough on defense issues to maintain any credibility with the American people. Taylor's rushed appointment to Secretary of Defense - pulling him out of the Army with a special dispensation from Congress - was not something he wanted, but in the state of emergency following Stennis' death, it wasn't something he could turn down, either.\n\nNow Taylor finds himself saddled with the task of overseeing his former peers in America's armed forces and coordinating with the massive military-industrial complex, all for a President struggling to maintain control over her own party and the American people. It is a job that only a patriot would do willingly - and he is nothing if not a patriot."

#McNamara
USA_Birch_Bayh_dep_desc:0 "------------\nSenator Birch Bayh of Indiana is a golden child among the Republican Party's younger class of senators, assuming the Vice Presidency after a long tenure in Indiana's state House of Representatives and on Capitol Hill, serving on the Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments. With his impressive knowledge of Senate procedure and the nuances of America's legal system, and a robust physical constitution capable of making hundreds of stump speeches across the nation, Bayh was tapped to become President McNamara's Vice President in 1971 at just 41 years of age.\n\nVice President Bayh's affability and familiarity with the political goings-on on Capitol Hill have turned him into the public face and political brains of the McNamara administration, giving the industrialist-turned-technocrat President a means to turn his expansive vision for American supremacy into reality."

USA_Donald_Rumsfeld_pol_desc:0 "------------\nDonald Rumsfeld is of a rare breed in Washington - an elected representative that nevertheless has a peerless mastery of foreign and defense policy that would put senior bureaucrats to shame. Graduating from Princeton University in 1954 on Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarships, Rumsfeld secured election as a member of Illinois' House of Representatives delegation in 1962 at 30 years old, and has since led an active career in Washington, deepening his ties with academics and intellectuals involved in defense and foreign policy.\n\nThough his intellectual prowess is well-known - Rumsfeld and McNamara have remained in contact since McNamara's service in President Nixon's cabinet - Rumsfeld is a man of the R-D's through and through, and represents the party's interests in McNamara's otherwise technocratic cabinet."

USA_George_Shultz_eco_desc:0 "------------\nGeorge P. Schultz is one of the most prominent of the 'Whiz Kids' - Washington outsiders primarily known for their technical or academic expertise - appointed to serve in high office in the McNamara administration. A respected professor of industrial relations at the University of Chicago, Schultz and McNamara first met during McNamara's tenure as Secretary of the Treasury during the Nixon administration, with Schultz's work on the negative effects of the silver-backed monetary system of the time leaving a strong impression on then-Secretary McNamara.\n\nCalled out of academia to serve in his own right as Secretary of the Treasury, Schultz also serves as McNamara's personal confidant and ally in the Cabinet. Schultz is frequently granted access to information typically reserved for other Cabinet secretaries - creating no small amount of friction with the other politicians in the administration."

USA_Dean_Rusk_mil_desc:0 "------------\nDean Rusk - President of the Rockefeller Foundation and college professor of government - represents a compromise between the wings of the R-D's in selecting President McNamara's Secretary of Defense. With the other candidates mulled being politically unacceptable for one reason or another, Rusk's nomination as Secretary of Defense would be derided by the NPP as a choice made by the 'lowest common denominator' - but Rusk's reputation for diligence and thoughtfulness precede him in the McNamara administration, and his prominence in expressing the view that America must continue to resist the spread of fascism worldwide have made him a comfortable intellectual fit with President McNamara.\n\nThough Rusk comes highly recommended as a public intellectual, allowing him to mesh well with the other technocrats appointed by the President, the presence of Rusk in the Cabinet reflects the administration's conventional approach to party politics in Washington, with President McNamara and the R-D's operating largely in tandem."

USA_Scoop_Jackson_mil_desc:0 "------------\nSenator Henry 'Scoop' Jackson's accomplishments and record are well-known in Washington: a socially liberal legislator from Washington State, a major proponent of a hawkish foreign policy and the promotion of American values internationally, and a steadfast advocate for closer cooperation with the aerospace industry. Serving in the Senate for well over a decade, Senator Jackson is one of the most respected voices on defense affairs in the United States.\n\nHe is also the leader of the Center faction of the National Progressive Party, making his nomination as President McNamara's Secretary of Defense a seismic shock in Washington politics. The nomination of an NPP leadership figure to such an important post has caused a political firestorm, with some of the most contentious confirmation hearings in American history. It also accurately reflects President McNamara's approach to politics: that the President leads the country with the best by his side, party interests be damned."

#McGovern
USA_Bob_Dole_dep_desc:0 "------------\nDespite their opposing affiliation within the Republican-Democratic Party, President McGovern and Vice President Bob Dole are known for being close colleagues from their days serving together in the United States Senate. As men from the Midwestern states of South Dakota and Kansas, the two made common cause sponsoring agricultural and poverty relief bills across party lines, finding purpose in fighting for common decency and sense in politics.\n\nThe idealism of McGovern and Dole made for a striking contrast against the hard-headed rationalism of Robert McNamara in the '72 primaries, and the two rode to victory on a promise of fair and decent government for America and an end to foreign wars. Every so often, however, Dole's right arm - shattered during the battle for England in 1945 - twinges, an unpleasant reminder that reality may not be so kind to decent men."

USA_Henry_Cabot_Lodge_Jr_pol_desc:0 "------------\nBorn in 1902, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. has seen America endure two world wars, the Great Depression, and the postwar malaise. Descended from political royalty in the Lodge family of Massachusetts, Lodge resigned his seat in the Senate in 1941 to fulfill his duties as a U.S. Army reserve officer, laying the responsibility for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor squarely at the feet of then-President Joseph Kennedy's isolationist policies.\n\nLodge returned to the Senate following the war, working tirelessly to support the newly-founded Organization of Free Nations before being appointed by President Eisenhower to serve as the U.S.' Permanent Representative to the alliance. In the years since, Lodge has become the grey eminence of America's foreign policy establishment - and the first choice to serve as President McGovern's Secretary of State, bringing his decades of experience into play."

USA_Zbigniew_Brzezinski_mil_desc:0 "------------\nAt first glance, Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski seems deeply out of place in the McGovern administration. Born in Poland in 1928, Brzezinski escaped the destruction of his home country by virtue of his father's diplomatic posting to Canada. To say that the loss of his homeland shaped his views in adulthood would be an understatement; Brzezinski's entire academic career has been devoted to the study of totalitarianism and how best to equip America to resist its spread in the wake of the German and Japanese victory.\n\nFollowing the selection of McGovern as the R-D's nominee in 1972, Brzezinski publicly questioned McGovern's proposals to de-escalate tensions in the Cold War - but more from the perspective of objectives rather than of intent, asking whether McGovern was seeking peace for peace's sake, or to prepare America for some greater purpose in the struggle against tyranny. The nuance was not lost on the McGovern campaign, who needed a hawkish and nonpolitical appointee to bolster the administration's standing at the Pentagon - and Brzezinski had made himself a perfect candidate."

#Scoop
USA_Sid_McMath_dep_desc:0 "------------\nSid McMath is a man of many surprises. Despite being a Southerner and a decorated veteran of the Marine Corps, he is a staunch progressive and a champion of civil rights. During his term as governor of Arkansas, he led the charge against poll taxes, rural poverty, and the influence of oil barons in state politics. Although failing to win re-election in the gubernatorial race against segregationist Orval Faubus, he went on to become a successful trial attorney. As an attorney he won several landmark cases in the fields of personal injury law and civil rights, winning multi-million dollar recoveries for his working-class clients.\n\nHe was a natural choice for Scoop Jackson's vice president. McMath is the perfect embodiment of the ideal of the "New South": A vision of a South that doesn't try to cling to an antebellum past through segregation and sharecropping, but instead looks forward to a new era of social equality and economic progress. He is Scoop's best hope for reconciling the Far-Right Dixiecrats with the party's new progressive leadership."

USA_Frank_Church_pol_desc:0 "------------\nFrank Church has never been afraid to swim against the current. During a national upsurge of jingoism, he denounced US involvement in the South African War. When he entered politics at the height of the Grey Scare, he raised the alarm about the dangers of creeping securocracy. And when industry was ramping up to promote economic growth, Church called for the preservation of our natural wilderness. He took plenty of flak for his commitment to social justice, but history seems to have vindicated him.\n\nAs President Jackson's Secretary of State, he brings that same fearless progressive outlook to the world stage. He presents the world with an image of the United States as a friend, not a hegemon. He champions an America that doesn't work in the shadows, but leads in the light. Under Church's leadership, the State Department will promote a more inclusive and transparent OFN. His staunch opposition to foreign wars goes beyond even Jackson's own politics, and Jackson worries that the new face of his foreign policy might turn on him if American soldiers ever fight overseas again."

USA_Augustus_Hawkins_eco_desc:0 "------------\nGus Hawkins often likes to tell his story of riding a bus in LA as a child many years ago. A white woman sat down beside him and whispered to him, "You know, we sure are getting a lot of blacks in this neighborhood. I don't like sitting next to them, they smell." Hawkins, whose mother is black, was flabbergasted and told the woman that he was black himself. The woman refused to believe him. This left a strong impression on Hawkins, who resolved to refuse to pass as white and dedicated himself to the fight for civil rights.\n\nThe former Representative from Watt, California and current Secretary of the Treasury has had a long career as the "silent workhorse" of Congress. Hawkins never held rallies and marches, but worked tirelessly behind the scenes to pass a fair housing act. He never held a violent strike, but he worked closely with union leaders to craft new labor legislation. With his new post in President Jackson's cabinet, Hawkins will continue to fight for a fairer America the same way he always has: With firm words and strong handshakes."

USA_Arleigh_Burke_mil_desc:0 "------------\nAdmiral Arleigh Burke was once asked to explain the difference between a poor officer and a good officer. He answered, "ten seconds." A good officer is always vigilant, and never hesitates to fire when he sees the enemy in his sights. That was his method during the War, when his ships' standing orders were: "Destroyers to attack on enemy contact WITHOUT ORDERS from the task force commander." Some called him mad, but the number of IJN vessels he sent to the bottom of the Pacific helped him drown out that noise.\n\nAs Jackson's Secretary of Defense, he has championed the Navy's role in nuclear deterrence. He is active in promoting the mass deployment of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and as Chief of Naval Operations he proposed the 41 for Freedom initiative: The commissioning of 41 nuclear-armed submarines who can strike any nation from any sea undetected. His hawkish background and nuclear ambitions have brought him into conflict with Secretary of State Frank Church, and this inter-cabinet tension will be a continuing challenge for the Jackson administration."

#Yockey
USA_Louis_Byers_dep_desc:0 "------------\nSometimes, it takes the likes of a great speaker to rally the masses and assume power. Sometimes, it's the master bureaucrat, capable of sliding any piece of law into the heart of the nation, no matter how many hurdles are in the way. Sometimes, it's the powerful likes of the soldier-politician, calling for a stronger nation than ever before. And, sometimes, it just takes someone who fancies themselves a writer. \n\nLous T. Byers was certainly not the expected choice of power within the government of President Francis Parker Yockey and his American National Vanguard, but the current cabinet thanks their stars for Byers' position. Establishing his fervent support of Francis Parker Yockey upon the campuses of America across the country after years of supporting George Wallace, Byers' name came to the limelight after continuous writings to newspapers across the country, defending now-Secretary Revilo P. Oliver's postulation about the potential Judeo-Bolshevik conspiracy which led to President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Brought forward as someone who understands the spirit of the Vanguard, President Yockey set his ardent-fan as his running mate, and now he sits as the chief position of government, behind President Yockey himself. \n\nLuckily, however, Byers has managed to find friends throughout the cabinet, despite the rising tensions from within. Byers has taken himself to be a form of a translator for President Yockey, whose academic rhetoric tends to blow far above the understanding of much of America, as he attempts to popularize the National Socialist values of President Yockey in a digestible format for the American populace. What matters now is if the American public will take to enjoying Byers' reconstructed understandings of President Yockey's statements...or will they end up shooting the messenger?"
USA_Revilo_Oliver_desc:0 "------------\nDr. Revilo Pendelton Oliver has come far in the past ten years. A cofounder of the John Birch Society in 1958 and long time professor of philology at the University of Illinois, Oliver has become more famous for his anti-Semitic and white nationalist articles than his academic merit. The most notable of these articles, "Marxmanship in Dallas", postulates that John Kennedy was victim of a Judeo-Communist conspiracy and caused Oliver to break with the majority of his conservative colleagues.\n\nUndissauded by this setback, Dr. Oliver claimed that the Birch Society was operated by a "committee of Jews" and fully committed himself to the American National Vanguard, a rising faction of the NPP lead by fellow academic Francis Yockey. Oliver's fervent anti-Semitism has earned him a prize spot in the cabinet, though his distaste for religion as a whole has been played down. Now, Oliver faces the task of creating new relationships with the remains of the Western nations. It is left to his expertise to determine whether America will succeed in bending the OFN to the will of the ANV, or flounder into uncertainty."

USA_Harold_Thompson_desc:0 "------------\nFor a party so focused on the conspiracies of "Jewish financiers", it is ironic that such a secretive businessman with foreign intelligence ties was selected for the position of Secretary of the Treasury. With ties to much of the right wing of the NPP and the primary force behind the rise of the American National Vanguard, Thompson has worked to bring about change in America since the day of his recruitment as a Sicherheitsdienst agent at the young age of 18.\n\nFirst coming to prominence with his controversial article "I am an American Fascist," at the height of the Grey Scare, Thompson used his money to rise to a position of great influence within the NPP. Latching onto rising support for the ideas of Francis Yockey, Thompson has wormed his way into the cabinet, determined to eliminate the influence of market-distorters, secure the financial institutions of America, and keep a copy of every report for his handlers in Germania."

USA_John_Crommelin_mil_desc:0 "------------\nThroughout the likes of the American National Vanguard, one can find some of the most academic and well-educated minds of America's far-right, ranging from authors to professors to their very own students. However, to exclude the common man of the far-right's voice from politics would be a mistake; thus, we find the strongman, Admiral "Bomb-Run John" G. Crommelin serving as Secretary of Defense within the Presidency of Francis Parker Yockey. \n\nBorn within the heart of the American South in Montgomery, Alabama, Crommelin was raised amidst a heavily military family filled with his five brothers, as each had graduated United States Naval Academy of Annapolis, Maryland, and all had been called to serve in the chaos of the Second World War. A heart of steel and fire drove John G. Crommelin throughout the war, as his service as a naval aviator earned him a reputation of courage and skillfulness, before taking command of officership and beginning to rise through the ranks of the Navy. However, as the onset news of several of his brothers' deaths at the hands of the Japanese in the Pacific War, one streak bore a hole into Crommelin's heart, one which he would never escape throughout the war: hatred. Rage enveloped him in his warfare, as his daringness continued even within the losses of America during the war, and would shift towards the government, as they implemented further favorability towards the Air Force, and began implementing further civilian control over the Navy. John G. Crommelin's dissatisfaction, strongmanism, and southern-gentlemenliness would drive him to the likes of politics, eventually being picked up by Francis Parker Yockey as a potentially very useful asset in his representation of the far-right. Crommelin's dreams became realized as he retained control over the armed forces of the United States as Secretary of Defense. \n\nHowever, all is not dreamlike for Crommelin, or his attitude with the rest of the current administration. His furious hatred towards Hitler and the Nazis of Germany puts him in a fierce opposition towards many others in the Vanguard, for his belief in their aid towards Japan's murder of his brothers. Only time may tell how Crommelin will bear the stresses of the environment, however, one thing is for sure: the military has never seen such a wrathful fist driving its helm before."

#Hall

USA_Paul_Robeson_dep_desc:0 "------------\nGus Hall distinguished himself from past presidents by disregarding party compromises and political expertise when creating his Cabinet. The unionist's vision of America awaited not the servants of repressive, antediluvian institutions, he proclaimed, but dreamers with foresight and revolutionary zeal. With this in mind, his campaign searched high and low for a running mate exemplifying both.\n\nEnter Paul Leroy Robeson: film actor, All-American footballer, civil rights activist, and now the first African-American Vice President in history. The Princeton graduate served as the kinder, more educated contrast to the workingman Hall and his rhetoric, winning hearts with baritone-lacquered promises of an America that pays more than lip service to its principal values. Party fears over the untested "two-tone ticket" were summarily dashed by its upset victory in 1972, won in large part by black votes Robeson's presence had mobilized.\n\nYet talent mattered little before sickness and old age. Having barely fought down double pneumonia in 1965, the 72 year-old's health has only dwindled in the years since. Many worry that the aging vice president will spend more of his four years in a sickbed than in office; critics insinuate that President Hall considers Robeson's inevitable absence a prerequisite for his wide-reaching ambitions..."

USA_Alger_Hiss_pol_desc:0 "------------\nAs a man, Alger Hiss was equal parts brilliant and unpleasant. The long-time president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace combined minute-detail knowledge of every left-wing government and movement on Earth with obnoxious, condescending apologia thereof. Diplomats and officials learned not to spend a minute more than necessary around the former federal attorney; he often returned the favor by addressing his guests exactly a minute after their patience had worn thin.\n\nBut as a policymaker, the Harvard Law graduate was an avowed leftist with years of experience in public service: a rare breed within American foreign policy's establishment. His eager appeals to support socialist dissidents in Asia and Latin America eventually caught the attention of Washington's increasingly sympathetic politicos. Insiders prognosticated for Hiss a place in President Hall's Cabinet; by Inauguration Day, he was formally sworn in as Secretary of State.\n\nLeftists abroad may rejoice in knowing that the Arsenal of Democracy now expresses its formal support for the world proletariat's struggle. Meanwhile, anonymous sources hint that Hiss's prosecutorial finesse contributed to his appointment as much as his discreet connections to foreign socialists..."

USA_Larry_Itliong_eco_desc:0 "------------\nIn 1929, a sixteen year-old from someplace called Pangasinan stepped foot on the Port of San Francisco's docks. A year later, he joined his first strike. Beyond that was where old laborers' tales diverge, but all swore the legend of Larry Dulay Itliong, head of the United Farm Workers and darling boy of labor unions worldwide, began in the Gilded State's lowest dregs.\n\nFrom there the Filipino immigrant made his name organizing strikes up and down the West Coast, rousing his fellow tenants to fight for fair wages and fair treatment. Losing three fingers to an Alaskan cannery barely hampered Pitong Daliri, or "Seven Fingers", in his own war on poverty; by the Nixon administration's twilight years, press cameras captured the man and his iconic cigar wherever workers expressed their solidarity.\n\nGus Hall's victory meant that high office was a certainty for the veteran striker. Yet few foresaw his appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, a title once reserved for the who's who of bourgeois capitalism. With the federal government at his disposal, Itliong will preside over the first critical years of America's transfiguration into a land not just of liberty and justice, but of bread and roses too."

USA_William_Martin_mil_desc:0 "------------\nWilliam Hamilton Martin had few friends in Darwin and even fewer friends in the Pentagon. In fact he was as far away from the levers of American government as a naval intelligence officer can reasonably get, having been stationed in Australia for over a decade. Were it not for his supposed sympathies to domestic left-wing movements - rumors exacerbated by the multiple disciplinary actions he had accrued for disobedience "on moral grounds" - the glorified bureaucrat would have spent the rest of his career as one federal employee among many.\n\nOne can imagine his surprise when President Gus Hall offered Secretary of Defense out of the blue. Accepting it catapulted Martin into the Beltway overnight, with rank and stature high above the vast majority of his now-erstwhile superiors. But Hall's caveats were cryptic and disconcerting: Martin must uphold justice, he said, before the war profiteers and war criminals within his new bailiwick.\n\nIn the coming months, the Washington native will learn his exact place within the Hall administration... and the deeds his President will ask of him for justice's sake."

#General/Admiral bios

 GENERAL_WILLIAM_WESTMORELAND_DESC:0 "While a lot can be said about William Childs Westmoreland, both good and bad, few can doubt the position of power he currently holds over the United States Army. Graduating from West Point in 1936 and becoming a first lieutenant before the Fall of France, Westmoreland served with Valor under artillery battalions during the defense of the English mainland. Despite America having lost the war, Westmoreland returned home as a hardened veteran, providing valuable insight to combined arms theory and the improvement of the Armed Forces general staff. Completing airborne training in the aftermath, Westmoreland spent a large amount of his post-war years climbing the ranks of a career officer. Throughout the rest of the 50s, Westmore solidified himself as a key strategist and theorist for the new direction of America’s ground forces. This would eventually promote him to Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and later as one of America’s most senior generals, charting the nation’s course in terms of National Defense."
 GENERAL_EARLE_WHEELER_DESC:0 "Earle Gilmore “Bus” Wheeler, a DC Native, enlisted in the District of Columbia National Guard at the young age of 16 years old. After several promotions, he was eventually honorably discharged to enroll in the United States Military Academy, afterward serving in several military regiments as an officer. After a brief stint as a professor of mathematics, he would eventually get into training and leading several infantry divisions; including ones that served in the UK. Several successes and staunch leadership later landed him in the National War College before finally joining the United States General Staff in the late 50s. Since then, Wheeler has been one of the most important members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, working closely with the delicate, integrated command structure of the organization, and is currently ensuring that the Army is in tip-top shape. In Wheeler’s eyes, perhaps again one day, he will fight (and win) against the fascist menace choking the heart of Europe and Asia."
 GENERAL_LYMAN_LEMNITZER_DESC:0 "Lyman Louis Lemnitzer’s military career began with the now defunct United States Coastal Artillery Corps, enlisting as an artillery officer there after graduating from West Point in 1920. After serving for some years with his unit, Lemnitzer eventually left, returning to teach at West Point in 1926. With great ambition and the desire to do more for his country, Lemnitzer wound up in the United States Army Command and General Staff College as well as the United States Army War College; graduating from both with honors by 1940. Colonel Lemnitzer would eventually work his way up to serving with the War Plans Division of the Army, and would help assist the Army Ground Forces defending against Operation Sealion. Emboldened after America’s loss in the war, Lemnitzer would eventually become a Deputy Commander back at the War College, of which his excellence at that position would land him in the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Stressing the importance of combined arms artillery in modern military doctrine, Lemnitzer is arguably the most senior member of the Joint Chiefs, and backs up his position with great wisdom alongside personal prowess."
 GENERAL_MAXWELL_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Maxwell Davenport Taylor is best known among peers as daring and competitive with his military career; graduating 4th in his West Point class, serving as a Japanese diplomat and a Chinese attaché, being mentored by Matthew Ridgeway, graduating as a Major from the Army War College, and eventually coming into the position as the commander of the 101st Airborne Division. Under Taylor, “The Screaming Eagles” had great but limited successes in the UK. Once the war was lost, Taylor returned to West Point to serve as Superintendent, even writing the foundation for the modern Cadet Honor Code, but was later assigned to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Administration at the Pentagon. In this position, Taylor became critical of the Eisenhower administration’s foreign policy shortcomings, later becoming an ally of President-Elect Nixon. Later appointed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Nixon Administration, Taylor will use his experience as a skilled and veteran commander of the 101st to guide Special Operations on the ground force, wherever America may need them."
 GENERAL_CHARLES_BONESTEEL_DESC:0 "While Charles Hartwell “Tick” Bonesteel III was nothing but a simple Eagle Scout in his early days, he would eventually rise to prominence in his class at West Point during the early 30s; even becoming a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. Bonesteel served in several senior administrative positions in the Pacific, doing his best to assist the war effort before the fateful Atomic Bombing of Pearl Harbor. After the war’s end, Bonesteel became a special administrative assistant for the Secretary of State under President Eisenhower. Bonesteel’s field experience and administrative positions have landed him among the most senior generals America has."
 ADMIRAL_DAVID_MCDONALD_DESC:0 "David Lamar McDonald almost never began his military career in the first place after learning he was too young to even enter into the prestigious United States Military Academy. Undaunted, McDonald chose instead to enter into the Riverside Military Academy in his native Georgia, later graduating and enlisting in the United States Naval Academy after a renewed interest in naval tactics. Upon graduation in 1928, McDonald served upon the Battleships Missouri and Colorado, later becoming a naval flight instructor. This experience allowed him to become a Flag Secretary in the Atlantic, and later as executive officer of the carrier USS Essex, serving in the Pacific against the Imperial Fleet. McDonald eventually worked further developing naval aviation doctrine after the war, serving on more aircraft carriers before becoming the Commander of the Sixth Fleet, and later becoming Chief of Naval Operations for the entire US Navy. The youngest four-star admiral in the entirety of the Navy, McDonald hopes to use his decades long experience controlling the seas under the banner of democracy once again for the good of the free world."
 ADMIRAL_THOMAS_MOORER_DESC:0 "Thomas Hinman Moorer can trace his family ancestry back to someone who fought for America’s independence all the way back to the early days of the Revolution. As such, fighting against tyranny is in his blood. Although he grew up a rural Alabama boy, Moorer entered into the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1933; becoming increasingly interested in naval aviation. Moorer would eventually complete naval aviation training, and would serve most of World War II flying with squadrons assigned to American Carriers in the Pacific theatre. After being shot down over the coast of Darwin, Moorer survived with a Purple Heart and tenacity which would further award him for helping to evacuate overrun islands in the Pacific at the height of Japanese air supremacy. At the war’s conclusion, Moorer continued to serve in the Pacific Fleet before eventually becoming a Vice Admiral in 1962, hoping one day to get revenge on the Imperial Navy which had defeated the greatest fighting force he had ever known."
 ADMIRAL_HORACIO_RIVERO_DESC:0 "Horacio Rivero, although once a poor student from Puerto Rico, would become the first Hispanic admiral in United States history. After a recommendation to the United States Naval Academy which would change his life, he would graduate 3rd from his class and wind up in positions on heavy cruisers. Studying at MIT to master Electrical Engineering before reentering into the Navy, Rivero would serve on several battleships in the Pacific war, providing naval invasion support. Eventually, his command on the USS Pittsburgh would save all hands on deck during an enemy torpedo attack, gaining him widespread acclaim. After the conclusion of the Pacific war, Rivero continued his career working for several special agencies under the United States Navy. This would land him on the frontlines of the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, of which his unflinching tenacity perhaps kept the world from exploding. His leadership would allow him to be promoted to Admiral, breaking the glass ceiling and providing further excellence to wherever the Navy would be needed next under his command."

 POLITICS_RFK_DESC:0 "Robert Francis Kennedy certainly didn't grow up in an impoverished family. Part of the Kennedy dynasty of businessmen and politicians, his childhood was a privileged one. He grew up in suburban Massachusetts, one of nine children in a profoundly American family, and was raised to appreciate their Irish and Catholic heritage. Living through the Great Depression for most of his childhood, he witnessed his countrymen face impoverishment as they never had before.\n\nGoing on to attend Catholic schools across New England, Kennedy decided to serve in the Navy after the tragic death of his brother Joseph Kennedy in 1943. Kennedy would serve his country in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, with his relatively short service in the armed forces having a profound influence on his life, and his decision to enter politics.\n\nFollowing an honorable discharge, RFK entered journalism school, particularly interested in welfare and social programs designed to help the unfortunate. He was in attendance at the peace conference between the United States and Japan, and after the war visited Sweden to write about their extensive welfare programs. When his brother, John F. Kennedy, emerged as the running mate to Richard Nixon, Robert quickly proved his political acumen, to the extent that his brother would say that "If I need something done and done quick, I go to Bobby."\n\nTragedy would strike soon after. JFK's assassination not only broke Robert's heart - the death of his beloved brother severed any remaining ties to the R-Ds, whose President had vetoed the Civil Rights Act. Disillusioned with partisan politics, RFK decided to join the National Progressive Party, determined to make the American dream possible for all of his countrymen, and was promptly pushed to run for the Presidency. Swept into office in 1964, Robert became one of a rare breed. He became the champion of an American idealism seen in few others, someone who believed in hope in a world which possessed very little."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "In many ways Lyndon Baines Johnson, often referred to by his initials LBJ, is living proof that the American dream still lives. Born in a Texas farmhouse and raised in humble conditions, far from the glitz and glamour that America's elite grew up in, Johnson has not forgotten the lessons of his modest upbringing. Though he spent several years teaching impoverished children in Texas, he quickly found his calling in politics. With a natural talent for aggressive persuasion and dealmaking that would soon be widely known in Washington as the "Johnson Treatment", he began first as a congressional aide before quickly ascending to the House of Representatives, then the Senate. There he reigned as Majority Leader of the Republican and then Republican-Democrat party for a decade. Now he has finally climbed as high as any American can, and has been elected the President of the United States. LBJ has promised to heal the wounds that have been festering in America for decades, and is determined to tackle the issues of racial and economic inequality once and for all. Johnson envisions an American society where every man has equal rights and equal opportunity to succeed. However, with Germany descending further into chaos by the day, and Japan fighting to maintain and expand its sphere, Johnson may not be able to focus exclusively on the home front, as events beyond his control threaten to pull America back onto the global battlefield once more."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "Richard Milhous Nixon is a complicated figure. Originally a Representative, and then Senator from California, he rapidly rose through the ranks of Congress through skilled political manouvering. During his time as a Senator, Nixon worked closely with Joe McCarthy in carrying out the Grey Scare, working to root out suspected fascists in government. And while he didn't share the spotlight to the same extent as McCarthy did, nobody doubts that Nixon is still an anti-fascist crusader through and through.\n\nA lifelong member of the Republican Party, Nixon has never been totally comfortable working alongside the Democrats. The broad popularity of the National Progressive Party dictates that they must, however, and the coalition ticket that won him the 1960 election has made his presidency a living hell. John F. Kennedy's position as the Vice President has driven a wedge in the Executive Branch, as his own magnetic charisma and stunning competence have taken the spotlight away from Nixon more than once.\n\nAs much as Nixon wants to focus on foreign policy, so he can act to undermine the unstable German and Japanese empires, domestic affairs have gotten in the way. Civil rights issues can no longer be ignored, as racial tensions flare and people demand action, one way or another. While Nixon has been reluctant to endorse either segregation or integration, staying on the fence is becoming increasingly costly.\n\nOf course, Nixon is also doing what he can to keep the NPP down, including some... extralegal means. With challengers coming at him from all sides, including within the White House, Nixon will have a hell of a time trying to keep the ship of state steady."
 POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "존 피츠제럴드 케네디가 정치적 명성을 얻기까지의 길은 다른 많은 사람들의 논란으로 가려져 왔었습니다. 강력한 케네디 가문의 자손이자 조지프 케네디 대통령의 아들인 그는 형 조지프 케네디의 죽음 이후 태평양 전선에서 불려져와 그 이후 계속 그의 아버지의 길을 밟도록 길러져 왔습니다. 1948년 대선과 민주당의 공중분해 이후, 존의 동생 로버트 케네디를 제외한 케네디 가문은 민주당의 잔여 세력과 함께 공화당으로 향하면서 공화민주당의 일원이 되었습니다. 몇몇은 존 F. 케네디의 경력이 그의 아버지의 실패로 더럽혀질 것이라고 예상하였으나, 존의 개인적 카리스마와 적응력은 그를 아버지의 그림자에서 벗어나오게 하였습니다. 1960년 케네디는 공화민주당의 부통령 경선에서 승리하였습니다. 불행히도, 그의 러닝메이트는 리처드 닉슨이었습니다.\n\n이제 존은 혼란에 빠진 국가의 선장이 되었습니다. 이 국가는 그의 지도를 간절히 기대하고 있습니다. 하지만 많은 미국인들이 그를 안정의 상징으로 보는 한편, 그를 장애물로 보는 사람들도 있습니다. 인종분리주의를 열렬히 찬성하는 자들은 그의 이상주의가 민권법안의 입법을 더욱 진행시키리라 여기고, 골수 진보주의자들은 그가 동생 로버트처럼 열정적이지 않다고 비난합니다. 운명은 존 F. 케네디가 국가를 선도하도록 명하였으나, 국가를 위험한 수역에서 벗어나게 할 사람이 정말 그일까요?"
 POLITICS_GEORGE_WALLACE_DESC:0 "George C. Wallace portrays himself a both an honorable Southern gentleman and a true red-blooded American, being the only one willing to protect his proud country from the Japanazi menace while preserving the rights and liberties his people hold dear. In reality he is an opportunist par excellence, willing to mold his ideology as he sees fit in order to maximize the possible turnout at the polls. Seeking to court the fine white voters as governor in his native Alabama, this inevitably manifested itself as a staunch segregationist platform, defending it on all fronts from un-American fifth columnists seeking to undermine states' rights. As the Democratic Party imploded in 1948 and the "Solid South's" party loyalty wavered, Wallace eagerly jumped ship to Richard Russell Jr.'s fledgling States' Rights Party, then to the Patriotic Party, then finally to the National Progressive Party.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Wallace successfully moderated his position just enough to win the support of the NPP's Frankensteinian voter base, and eventually the majority of the nation. Now that he finally sits in the White House, his alliance of convenience with many of the NPP's more left-leaning members is rapidly wearing thin - how do you hold together a party bound only by hatred of the establishment if you are the establishment? But Wallace likely doesn't plan for the alliance to last much longer. Rather, it seems he'll be using his time to legally buttress segregation as much as he can.

 POLITICS_JOHN_MCCORMACK_DESC:0 "대부분의 대통령들에게 그들의 취임식은 수 년간의 정치적 야망과 성공을 합쳐 이들을 지구상 가장 높은 공직에 두는 한편 궁극적으로는 국가를 그들의 이상에 맞추는 것입니다. 전 하원의장 존 맥코맥에겐 그런 사치가 허용되지 않았습니다. 혼란과 유혈이 낭자한 날 의회에서 끌려나와 백악관으로 향하게 된 그는 혼란에 빠진 국가를 마주하고 있습니다. 민권법에 대한 닉슨 대통령의 행동이 불러온 분노가 의회에서는 어떠한 예의도 찾아볼 수 없게 하였고, 입법보다는 고성이 오가는 논쟁이 더 많은 시간을 차지하게 되었습니다. 사람들 또한 목소리를 높였고, 매주 폭동과 시위가 발생하고 있고 유권자들은 국가진보당의 극단주의자들에게 지지를 돌리고 있습니다.\n\n맥코맥은 백악관에 스스로를 고립시키고, 믿을 수 있는 참모진과 친구들과만 국가중대사를 논하며 미국이 향하고 있는 혼란스러운 파도를 잠재우는 역할은 다른 대리인들에게만 맡기고 있습니다. 위기에 빠진 당, 인종분리주의라는 분열적인 문제 그리고 급속히 격렬해지고 있는 남아프리카 전쟁이라는 문제와 마주한 주저하는 대통령의 다음 임기 며칠은 미국의 다음 수 년을 좌우하게 될 것입니다."

 POLITICS_CURTIS_LEMAY_DESC:0 "만약 누군가가 1962년의 커티스 르메이에게 그가 몇년 안에 대통령이 될 것이라고 말한다면, 그는 면전에서 그 사람을 비웃고 멍청한 놈이라고 했을 것입니다. 그러나, 출마한 적이 없었음에도, 커티스 르메이는 조지 월러스의 재앙적인 임기에 뒤이어 대통령직에 취임하게 되었습니다.\n\n1964년 선거운동에서 "아프리카를 석기시대로 되돌리자"고 하여 논란이 되었던 전 공군 대장은 걸걸하고 무당파적인 본성 때문에 월러스 선거운동본부의 많은 사람들에게 정치적 골칫거리로 여겨졌습니다. 그는 한번도 진정한 정치인인 적이 없었고, 월러스 행정부에서 르메이의 주된 역할은 방위 문제, 특히나 미국의 핵능력을 다루는 것이었습니다. 이제 월러스가 떠났고, 르메이는 인종분리주의에 대한 입장을 정해야만 합니다. 잠재적 정적들로 둘러싸여 있고 문제에 빠진 국가를 치유하는 임무를 맡은 르메이에게 푸른 창공은 먼 이야기일지도 모릅니다.\n\n그럼에도, 르메이 대통령은 이 문제들을 매우 침착하게 대처해왔습니다. 그 주변으로 폭풍이 몰려오는 가운데, 그는 미국이 이 문제를 이겨나갈 수 있을 것이라고 굳게 믿고 있습니다. 1943년 그는 미국 역사상 최악의 참패를 목격하였으며, 중폭격기의 조종석에서 폭풍을 헤쳐나갔고, 이제 그는 마침내 결정적인 행동으로 국가를 치유할 기회를 잡았습니다. 앞으로 대통령에게 한가지는 확실할 것입니다. 커티스 르메이의 감시 하에 미합중국은 더 큰 혼란에 빠지지 않을 것이라는 겁니다. 감히 그럴 수 없겠죠."

Due to this success, the vast majority of the American public are either pleased with or don't care about the war. However, there is a small group discontent with America's involvement as a whole, but they are basically inconsequential."

### Foreign tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Bombing_Airfields:0 "Our best planes are ready to take control of the skies over Sudwestafrika. We're going to bomb enemy airfields in the Sudwest to oblivion to ensure that our troops won't be harassed by any German planes.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Desert_Training:0 "The Namibian deserts are harsh, hot, and hostile for our troops stationed in South Africa. We must prepare them for the landscape so that we can force the Sudwest out of the war early.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Zentral_Liberville_NI:0 "Libreville is a valuable city within the Afrikan realm, providing essential supplies to enemy troops. We need to focus our energy into an attack on this city; if we take Libreville, we damage the Zentral, and we take important resources away from the Reich's grasp.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Ost_AgtOrng:0 "The rough terrain of Ostafrika renders a land invasion nearly impossible. Luckily, we have the Rainbow Pesticides on our side. The use of these substances would clear out all the impassable foliage and make an invasion of Ostafrika much easier for our soldiers.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Rock_and_Roll_Mother_Fucker:0 "The jungles of Ostafrika provide a natural citadel for the stationed German troops. If we are to defeat the enemy, we must train our guys in jungle warfare. We need to be able to move swiftly through the trees and hit the Germans where they least expect it.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_SAF_Buying_Out_Guns:0 "Our allies in South Africa are always in need of more guns, rifles, whatever we have. Seeing as they are our allies in this war, it is imperative that we keep their soldiers supplied. We don't want a supply issue to hinder us from winning this war, so let's ship more weapons their way.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_Buying_Up_Everything:0 "Not only do the South Africans need guns, but they also need artillery and support equipment. Shipping over some of these materials would give our ally a strategic advantage. We need all the help we can get from South Africa if we want to win this war.\n"
USA_Send_One_Advisor:0 "We may not be as involved in this war as South Africa and her enemies, but we can always increase the number of advisors we send over. Though it may cause some backlash, our logistics and battle plans would be improved, and we could invest more resources to ensure a victory over the Germans.\n"
USA_Send_Two_Advisors:0 "This war is becoming increasingly important every day that we are over here. We need to expand our logistics capabilities even more, we need to bring more troops to join the fight no matter how much hate we get back home.\n"


### Domestic Tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_Cranking_Up_Draft_tt:0 "The number of soldiers we are currently fielding is not nearly enough to win us the war. In order to bring more soldiers into the fold, we have to institute a draft. Many citizens back at home will certainly condemn us for this decision, but we must accept this consequence if we want to continue the fight."
USA_SAF_WAR_Cancelled_The_Draft_tt:0 "Our folks in the States are livid in their response to the draft. Protests are being held everywhere in our country, and we are starting to regret this decision. We must find a way to reverse the draft, no matter the cost, if we want to regain support for our government.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_No_More_Excuses_tt:0 "Ever since this war began, the practice of draft dodging has been widespread. In general, our young men are finding ways to avoid the draft. From this point forward, there will be no exceptions regarding who can be drafted. The more men we send over, the quicker this war will be over.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_reverse_the_exemptions_tt:0 "Our recently-drafted men are now resorting to even more drastic measures to ensure they can go back home. They are really bringing the morale of our whole army down; we must send them back, even if we have to lose some potential soldiers. Maybe the public will forgive this mishap.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_domestic_prop_tt:0 "Ever since the South African War began, people were holding anti-government protests. We need to activate the propaganda machine and cool the discontent that strangles our country. If we can convince the public that we can win this war, we will have one less domestic issue to worry about.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_take_out_troops_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been fighting for a while now, and we believe that giving a few battalions a trip home could work to our advantage. We may get some good publicity if we can bring some soldiers back home with smiles. This action would have a marginal effect on our remaining troops, but it would certainly give a little boost to war support.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_New_training_Shit_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been using up a lot of effort against the enemy. Not only does this produce a lack of ammo and supplies, but we also lose valued men when we put so much on the line. It's time to tone down the troops. We may lose some combat efficiency, but we will save human lives.\n"
USA_SAF_Talk_down_involvement_tt:0 "Support for this war is dwindling, and it's about time we put something in the papers. We have the option to reassure the public that we are not as involved in this war as the South Africans are. This will make our folks at home happy, but it could negatively impact South African troops and dampen their morale.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_bring_back_our_guns_tt:0 "This war is just not going in our favor, but we don't want to lose everything we have here. We must buy back the guns we loaned to our South African allies. This action would diminish whatever hopes our allies have left, but it would show the American public that we intend on ending the war soon."

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal things came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and fire rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from their bodies. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any ancient warmaster or khan. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. He made a signal and the helicopters left back through the smoke, blasting their music as they left the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten." #duplicate loc key

"대통령님, 저는 종종 길거리에 있는 사람들 - 착하고, 열심히 일하고, 정직한 미국인들 - 그들이 내년에 직업을 가질 수 있을지에 대한 의문을 가집니다. 이들 즉 광부, 철강 노동자, 농부들은 미국 산업의 고동치는 심장부입니다. 미국 정부가 외국 상품 구매에 보조금을 지급하고 미국인들은 동전이나 뒤지게 내버려 두는데 어떻게 미국을 강하게 유지한다고 주장할 수 있겠습니까?"\n\n베넷은 헤링턴을 향해 중립적으로 미소짓습니다. "무역의 아름다운 점은, 헤링턴 씨, 모두가 이익을 본다는 겁니다. 당신은 미국 산업이 약해지고 있다고 말합니다. 저는 관세가 OFN을 전체에서 인하됨에 따라 미국 산업은 점점 더 높이 팽창하고 있다고 생각합니다. 당신은 미국이 동맹국들로부터의 수입으로 인해 약해졌다고 말합니다. 우리가 나치가 괴뢰국들한테 하는 것 처럼 동맹국들을 쥐어 짜는걸 원합니까? 미국은 결코 이 세상에서 홀로 설 수 없으며, 독일인과 일본인과 같은 자들과 마주하고 있는 동안에는 확실히 그렇게 할 수 없습니다!

"베넷 대통령님, 당신은 OFN 내에서 더 자유로운 무역을 통해 자유 세계 사람들 사이의 형제애를 말하고 있습니다. 비록 OFN이 압제에 맞서 단결해야 하는건 맞지만, 저는 당신의 접근방식의 지혜에 의문을 제기합니다; 당신의 정책은 미국의 노동자들과 산업계에는 귀를 기울이지 않으면서 무모함과 리더십을 혼동합니다. 조약항은 우리에게 30년 전의 유화책 또는 오늘날 형제애에 대한 순진한 희망에 대한 미국의 이익을 무시하는 모든 비용을 상기시켜 주어야 합니다.\n\n"스미스 상원의원님, 우리는 미국이 자유롭고 번영하는 세계를 상징한다는 우리의 약속으로 일본, 독일과 우리 자신을 구별지을 수 있습니다. OFN은 사람들의 공동체이지 전체주의 지배나 식민지 의존을 위한 수단이 압니다. 자유 무역은 자유가 살아남는 가장 확실한 수단이며 자유롭고 열린 교환으로 사람들을 함께 묶습니다." 베넷 대통령은 스미스를 물끄러미 내려다보았습니다. "함께 번영하지 않으면 홀로 멸망합니다.”"

"헤링턴 씨, 당신의 공감능력은 존경하지만, 당신이 있는 단체에 대해 궁금한 점이 있습니다. 미국 국민들은 특히 거스 홀과 같은 사람들이 국유화와 계급 투쟁을 외치고 있는데, NPP가 이론이 아닌 실제로 어떻게 통치할 것인지 궁금해 합니다. 미국에는 할 일이 많지만, 부하린주의 헛소리를 지르는 것은 당신이 어떻게 해도 되는 짓이 아닙니다."\n\n 헤링턴의 얼굴이 분노로 일그러졌습니다. "그렇게까지 저급한 짓을 하십니까? 우리 중 가장 급진적인 사람으로 우리 당 전체를 판단하는 짓을요? 저는 분명히 말할 것입니다: 홀씨의 견해는 당의 극단에 있고, 저는 그들을 지지하지 않으며, 당 지도부는 그들을 지지하지 않습니다. 우리는 포용적인 미국, 배려하는 미국, 사람들이 검은 셔츠나 정치장교의 부츠를 두려워할 필요가 없고 대신 동료의 자선을 신뢰하는 미국을 지지합니다. 대통령님, 공공의 선이 아니라 두려움에 의지하는 것은 당신이 하는 짓입니다.

OFN을 무시하는 것은 무례와 범죄의 경계선 사이에 있습니다. 당신은 이 일의 목적을 고려하지도 않고 그것이 초청하는 외국과의 관계를 비난합니다. 즉, 세계의 자유국가를 그들이 자립할 수 있을 때까지 육성하는 것 말입니다. 자유세계가 시시각각으로 시들어가는 동안 우리는 못본척 아메리카를 어슬렁거리지 않을 것입니다. 균형은 어떻게든 맞춰져야 합니다. 균형이 존재합니다. 당신이 그것을 찾으려고 노력했더라면 좋았을 겁니다."\n\n헤링턴 : "의원님, 혹시 성경 읽어보셨나요? '악인의 길은 돌로 평평하게 닦여있지만, 그 끝에는 지옥의 구덩이가 있다.' 저는 해외에서의 무의미한 모험에 대한 의욕을 잃은 미국을 대변합니다; 그 모험을 요구하는 사람들과 우리 자신을 더 가깝게 놓는 것은 남아공, 인도네시아, 아라비아에서 우리가 목격했던 피의 소굴로 이어진 돌로 길을 닦는것 놓는 것과 다를 바 없습니다. 저는 미국이 언젠가는 국경을 넘어 억압받는 민족을 향해 전폭적인 관심을 가질 것이라고 확신합니다. 하지만 지금은 그렇지 않습니다. 우리 자신의 자유에 대한 요구가 여전히 이렇게 많이 존재하는 한 말입니다.""

Now, years after the simmering defeat of the last great war, the government finds itself facing these enemies once more, not within the wintry dread of political machinations and espionage; rather, it is time for the United States to prepare once more for the battlefield. Now is the time for the United States to rise, and lead the march for freedom, for liberty, for democracy!\n\nThanks to the preparations of our administrations and Presidents prior, the United States has come leagues ahead of preparedness compared to our worries of the past. However, we have a long path ahead of us if we intend to defeat the enemies of America. Nevertheless, we shan't suffer again, we shall defeat these bastards, once and for all!"
USA_ww3_mobilize_the_army_desc:0 "The United States, despite the sufferings of wars lost in history's turned pages, has grown to possess one of the most effective, most respected, and most powerful armies on the world's stage. Thousands of American men and women have proven themselves as heroes of the American people in the Army.\n\nHowever, although the power within the Army remains unquestioned, we must face the realities of some issues. The Army is a ferocious beast, but a beast that must be roused to action from slumber. However, the war-cries of Americans' enemies have rung out across the world; thus, it is time to spurn our own beast to action, and let loose the true hounds of war: the United States Army. The Army must begin immediate effective mobilization in order to respond to the growing encroachment of enemy forces, while bringing the reserves to the front lines. The United States Army must be prepared to take the offensive and be ready to strike!"
USA_ww3_scramble_the_airforce_desc:0 "The skies, holding the sun, the moon, and the stars, have become the newest addition to the ways in which humanity can wage warfare. From the skies above the Marne to the storms raging above Saint-Mihiel, the United States set a precedent for the quality sought in men seeking to bring the fury of the United States Armed Forces to the heavens above.\n\nHowever, the strength of our enemies have grown to match such fury, and bring about fiery destruction with their advancements in technology and tactics, with the potential of our enemies to spread death and terror if they penetrate our air defenses. Furthermore, the administration has come to realize that the Air Force being spread out across the country has handicapped its ability to move effectively to the new warzones being created everyday. We must set the Air Force to the highest alert, and have our aerial units ready to face the enemy within a moment's notice!"
USA_ww3_emergency_naval_procurement_act_desc:0 "The Pentagon's forecast attrition rates beggar belief. Soldiers, equipment, ships, and aircraft will be written off at an astronomical rate, expended to keep the war far from the American homeland. That assumption depends on the ability of the Navy to continue to prosecute the war and supply our troops abroad. If the Pentagon's estimates are accurate, the shipyards will need to be spun up to full capacity now to make sure the Navy keeps the war away from home."
USA_ww3_naval_invasion_crash_course_desc:0 "Although the protection of a navy shows in the guarding the open waters surrounding the United States on all sides, it can be safely assumed that the United States Navy can only act as a shield around our lands for so long. The Fascists have struck quickly and viciously before, and we cannot hope that staying on the defense will save us. No, we shall penetrate the barriers of the seas to strike against our enemies shores, to plunge the sword of the American military deep into the hearts of our enemies before we dare allow them to take the first step.\n\nUnfortunately, although the plans shall be ambitious, we must prepare for such aspirations lest we intend to see our military plunge to the bottom of the seas. Thus, the administration shall immediately order the instruction of naval invasion preparation and execution to our military command. Our command will take the first step, strike first, and cut the throat of the beast before it dares to claim the lives of any more good-hearted Americans!"
USA_ww3_impliment_war_bonds_desc:0 "America's participation in the first two World Wars stretched the financial resources of the country to the limit, and the realities of modern, mechanized warfare have come at a higher cost than we could have ever imagined. Income taxation will not nearly be enough to fill the yawning chasm of the discretionary budget, and our financial institutions and capital markets are beginning to balk at the successive regular bond issuances by the Treasury. We need to take our financing drive directly to the American people, mobilizing their savings for the war effort through retail war bonds."
USA_ww3_nationalize_air_industry_desc:0 "The United States has had a long term of industrial superiority, both as it continues to grow within history, as well as when it is spurned into a furious upkeep in supporting the nation, such as what happened during the Second World War. In those years past, the people of the United States acted as the blood within the Great Dragon that awoke, allowing the production necessary to modernize the war effort in the skies above.\n\nNow, however, we, as Americans, have found ourselves facing the damning strength of our enemies. Now, what we need is not only the talent and experience of the military, but the equipment necessary to secure our superiority, especially within the skies. Thus, the administration will work towards nationalizing several airline manufacturers to bring them to support the war effort within the United States. Sure, our critics may cite this as 'feeding the Military-Industrial Complex,' but we are at war, damnit!"
USA_ww3_god_bless_america_desc:0 "Our preparations are complete and we are ready to wage war with the enemy. Every piece of equipment is ready to be used. Our tanks and planes are fueled and ready to go, and our infantry is loaded with the best bullets and guns we can offer. Our battleships are raring to take down the enemy's battleships. Every man and every woman is prepared to defend the homeland from a potential invasion. Liberty's bell rings in the ear of every American, and we are destined to fight until our final breath. May the American eagle guide us to absolute victory! The multitudes shout 'God Bless America!' from sea to shining sea!"
USA_ww3_rally_to_the_flag_desc:0 "It is a difficult requirement to fulfill, but we must draft American citizens for the fight abroad and for homeland defense. Our number of volunteers is not enough anymore. We have few supporters of the draft in Congress and among the population, but we will present this with a patriotic attitude. It is time for our everyday citizens to fight for the liberty of millions around the world. We're going to need all we can get for the war against our enemy, but our popularity is surely going to plummet once we implement this idea..."
USA_ww3_reinforce_the_triad_desc:0 "The superpowers of the world have built up hundreds, even thousands of nuclear warheads, ready to destroy the other powers at a moment's notice. The possibility of mutually assured destruction is very real and it could mark the end of the human race. We need to bolster up our detection and defense systems to ensure that at least one country still stands once this is all over. If we cannot stop the oncoming nuclear attack, we need to prepare the counterattack so if we are blown to ashes, our enemy will go down with us."

The largest, well furnished and well funded United States Army installation in the state of Kentucky, sitting right on the outskirts of Hopkinsville, with all of the Army's latest and greatest. And as Private Rodney Bannister was about to find out, as he sat resting in his bunk with dreams of his family and girlfriend swimming through his mind, it would be the most comfortable place he'd have the grace to pass through for a long, long time.\n\n"Get your fucking asses up, now, all of you!" Gunnery Sergeant Hewitt commanded, exploding into the dark and formerly silent resting quarters of the young soldiers. Bannister hurried to attention, as had his fellow Soldiers all around him as they all faced forwards where the Gunnery Sergeant came forward. "Get your shit together, men, the United States is at war! Get your utilities on and your asses in gear, be formed up outside the barracks at 0430, move it!" the Gunnery Sergeant exploded before leaving the room. The glass of stability which had continuously wavered in strength for Bannister was shattered as the Gunnery Sergeant left the room. Sure, he'd trained and all for the prospect of serving his country, but he never expected the day would come when everything went to hell like this. Bannister threw his uniform together as best he could and hurried out, along with the rest of his platoon.\n\nOutside, the frigid air of an early Kentucky morning was evident, but the rush of fear and terror was what truly crawled up the soldiers that morning. Standing at attention, Bannister stared forward as he saw his Gunnery Sergeant come into frame, yelling to his platoon, "The United States of America has, as all of you know, entered a state of war with the same men responsible for our defeat in the 1940's. Some of your fathers know that all too well, some of them may have even fought alongside myself back in England. All of that has come back, and we will not allow those bastards to harass the world any longer. Your platoon is being transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where you will all undergo extensive training to prepare for deployment out to fight those who think they can fuck with the goddamned United States. Hooah, soldiers." the Gunnery Sergeant concluded.\n\nAs Private Bannister continued forward with the rest of his platoon to get onto the trucks heading to Fort Carson. But no matter what, he couldn't shake the fear out of his head. This was it, what if he never got to see Jennifer again? Or, what about the rest of his family, and his little brother? Hell, what if he never got to see the rest of the world again, he thought, as he boarded the truck with thoughts of nuclear winter abroad."

Considering the circumstances, Isaac Summers figured that his mom, the one driving the car, would be her usual chatterbox self, gushing and embarrassing Isaac. She'd always been that way whenever Isaac decided to go to one of the school dances. Rather, he found himself in a somber atmosphere as his mom drove him down the Pennsylvanian road to the Army office in Harrisburg. Finally, the car came to a halt right in front of the big brick building. He felt his mother's tears grace his cheek as they hugged one last time before he walked towards the building.\n\nThe inside was an absolute disaster. Hundreds, if not nearly a thousand boys like him had received the same yellow slip titled "Order to Report for Induction" notifying him of his draft into the military. He waited his turn in line for hours until finally, he exchanged his paperwork with the woman behind the desk, approving him for his conscripted entrance into the United States Army after a quick physical and mental health check and approval test with the words "infantrymen" written on top. A few days later, he looked out the window of the moving truck, thinking of how he was going to be toting a rifle on some battlefield, surrounded by blood and filth, instead of studying economics at Stanford like the plan was.. However, the journey didn't end there, as he sat while his hair was nearly shaved off by the Army barbers at Fort Carson. Finally, a Staff Sergeant came over to the new recruits, yelling, "Welcome to the United States Army, gentlemen. The United States has gone to war and we need your talent to serve the armed forces now more than ever." His voice droned on, but Isaac picked up as he heard the Staff Sergeant continue, "...Summers, Drake, Clarence, you eight are gonna be led by Corporal Bannister." as the soldier moved forward to the rightmost of the squad. Now, out in the middle of Colorado, was where the army's finest will find their way to the front lines.\n\nThe mud continued to gunk up Isaac's teeth as the barbed wire scraped against his ankles, as the recruit crawled and gunshots popped above him at the firing ranges nearby. All of a sudden, a hand popped in front of him beneath the barbed wire, and Corporal Bannister's face came out of the blur. "Come on, man, I've got you." The corporal said, as he helped pull Isaac forward. Isaac felt a genuine care and concern within the Corporal's voice as he got through it, feeling a connection to his squad leader."

Despite all of the harrowing difficulties, he had been hastily transformed from the next applicant to an Ivy League college to a true soldier of the United States Army. His feelings had devolved from resentment to a difficult mix of steadfastness and dread as the ship journeyed onwards. The Private's thoughts had almost drowned out the stomping of boots behind him as his squad leader, Corporal Bannister approached, rousing Summers to attention.\n\n"You're fine, Summers, take the time to enjoy yourself." Bannister said to the young Private, who looked troubled. "Thinking ahead?" the Corporal asked, thinking about the weeks they had spent travelling aboard the John Pope.. "Honestly, sir, no. Thinking about the past, more like, thinking of everything before all of this, before, well, the draft went out, uh, sir." He said while looking out into the waves crashing on the side of the boat. "Yeah, I get that, Summers. I didn't get that whole draft thing, I was down at the most comfortable base in Kentucky, thinking about how serving the country could help out paying for the wedding with my Jennifer. Think she's gonna be pissed with how long I'll be gone." The Corporal said, chuckling. Noticing his squadling's less than enthusiastic response, he asked, "Well, what about you, Summers? Where are you from?" The Private took a minute to respond, thinking of everything leading up to now. "Came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, just graduated out of high school, finalizing my application to Stanford to study economics, was thinking of going federal with the job. Managed to get top of my class too, things were looking great. Sure, no girlfriend, like you, sir, and only a mom back at home, but it looks like the world had other plans."\n\nThe Corporal heard the Private's downtrodden voice, and offered a pat on the back. "Hey, I wasn't a Stanford kid, and economics aren't my forte, but what's to say we have to be sad about it. Things are rough, but the country needs us, good people like your mother needs us, now more than ever. If you wanted to help change the world, you've found your way there, Summers, because America needs people like you who can grit their teeth and keep going. Besides, fascism's gotta suck for the economy, huh?" the Corporal said, offering one last pat on the shoulder before walking away."

Maurine Neuberger, Scoop's deputy and fellow senator in the NPP's Center wing, quietly thumbed through her notes as she waited for him to speak. Next to her sat the nominal head of the Center's more radical wing, Michael Harrington, who waited with the same expectant look as Scoop himself. The two could not be more different, but as the Center's leader, Scoop knew he needed both if the party was going to get anywhere.\n\n"As you know, our election prospects are still looking dire," began Scoop. "The Right still holds plenty of influence over the party, and no progressive voter is going to vote for the party whose last candidate was Strom goddamn Thurmond. Worst of all, we still don't even have a candidate!"\n\n"Well it would help if anyone had bothered to put their name forward," joked Harrington, with a bare hint of contempt. "Perhaps if we were to do more to support our core working class voters in the Midwest and elsewhere rather than kowtowing to segregationists... and filling our ranks with West Coast elitist types-"\n\nNeuberger, herself of proud Oregon stock, sat up with an offended look. "Everyone here is fighting for the same thing! I've done plenty to speak up for the underprivileged - at least I don't just sit around writing essays about it!"\n\nScoop sat still for a moment, smiling bemusedly as his colleagues continued to bicker and snipe at one another. In a way, they were a perfect reflection of the Center as a whole - determined to enact change, but endlessly at its own throat about what that change should be. Finally, he coughed, and the other two immediately ceased their childish exchange and looked to him once more. "You are both very different, which is exactly why we need somebody who can speak everyone's language. If we're to have any hope in this election, we need to move forwards with one voice."\n\nHarrington and Neuberger looked at each other unsure of what to say. Scoop glanced out the window with an uncertain look. "I don't know who the man to lead us is. But he better show up soon. Or we are screwed.""

"How are you, Bobby? Ethel still taking good care of you I hope?"\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy laughed at the playful wink his brother gave him. "I can hardly complain on the home life, Jack." His grin faded. "Still, current events haven't exactly been great for my sleep."\n\nThe older Kennedy nodded sympathetically. "The violence is getting worse, for sure." He frowned. "Nixon being a stick in the mud about it isn't helping things either. He still won't endorse any legislation on the matter."\n\n"Can't you do something about it? As long as the President sits on the fence, things will only get worse."\n\n"I'd love to, but you know how Nixon is," muttered John, idly stirring his coffee. "Knowing him he'd probably just veto whatever we put in front of him and yell at us for 'fracturing party unity'.\n\n"But this is far more important than party unity Jack! There are millions of Americans - millions of good, honest people - being cast aside for things that are far beyond their control. The longer we wait, the greater their suffering will be." Fixing his brother with an intense but encouraging look, he continued. "You're the Vice President. At the very least you can use your voice in the name of those who have no voice."\n\nJohn was silent for a moment. Then he smiled. "You've always been a good man, Bobby.

The circumstances aren't ideal, but I can think of no better man to be President right now." Robert could barely contain his adoring smile. "Think of all the things we can finally accomplish!"\n\n"Come on, Bobby, you're embarrassing me," chuckled John, who beamed nonetheless. "But thank you. I know I can always count on you."\n\n"Always. Like I'd leave you for the NPP or anyone else, especially when you're about to give this country the change it so desperately deserves!"\n\nRobert's enthusiasm, seemingly infectious, prompted more laughs from his brother. "Now, now, we have a lot of work to get through before we can set things in motion." His look became more serious, more determined. "The party's image is somewhat tarnished at the moment with the Nixon fiasco, so I've arranged some trips across the country to shore up support." At this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long itinerary of events and dates in various states and cities and handed it to Robert.\n\n"Of course. We do have the election to worry about." Robert frowned, before reverting to a smile. "Come on Jack, I suppose we can just enjoy this meal before your big tour, you've earned it."\n\nAnd so the brothers sat for a while longer, enjoying their food in peace. As the time finally came for them to leave, Robert quickly glanced at the list and noted his brother's first destination.

He wondered if he should just call it off, so great was his grief. Grief, and anger.\n\nJohn was killed because he was the president. He was only the president because of the Republican-Democrats. Because of Nixon lying like a bitch and doing everything in his power to stop progress and change, killing the Civil Rights Act and forcing John to step up to the firing line in the most damnably literal way. The party had chewed him up and spat him out. They had used him, just like they had used the entire Kennedy family and dragged their name through the mud.\n\nWhen a staffer poked their head into the room to wave him on stage, Robert stilled his tears, and prepared to give what would become one of the most shocking speeches of his career. After slowly ascending to the podium, he addressed the assembled crowd, giving a short but passionate eulogy in honor of his brother, extolling his candor, his way with words, and his dedication to America. The crowd nodded along, some cried, some bowed their heads. But none of them could prepare for what came next.\n\n"My brother was loyal to the Republican-Democrats through and through. He was loyal as they made every effort to avoid bringing this country true equality and justice. He was loyal as they charged blindly into an unnecessary and bloody war in Africa. He was loyal as he was ignored until the time where they needed a man to clean up their mistakes, and he was loyal as the fallout of their ignorance resulted in the loss of his life." He paused as many in the crowd stared agape. At least two from the party mouthed words of astonishment and curses at him.

Still, he had to try.\n\nFinally, the door to the office swung open. In walked Scoop Jackson, closely followed by his underlings Neuberger and Harrington.

"How committed are you to the Civil Rights Act?" asked Scoop. "You agree that the state of healthcare in this country is disgraceful?" asked Harrington. "Don't you think this country should do more to protect the environment?" asked Neuberger. It felt almost like a college debate club, but Robert answered all their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically.\n\nAs their questioning came to a close, Robert spoke up.

A peace where everyone could work towards the advancement of science, prosperity and-\n\nA sudden ringing cut across his psyche, and he was jolted from a dream of days past. Sitting sluggishly awake from his sadly earthbound bed, he fumbled for the telephone on his bedside cabinet and pulled the receiver to his ear. "John Glenn, speaking - way too early in the morning might I add."\n\nA panicked voice came across the line. "John, it's James.

"So what, the Germans got to the moon first and that just means space is over? What can we do? They can't just give up on the future!"\n\n"Nixon's already made his mind up.

I implore that the President reconsider his options.

This was perhaps the third time he had explained this simple concept to the assembled senators, and many were listening intently, but Lyndon B.

Last I checked, America was still an economic giant by all accounts, so I really fail to see the merit of this passion project of yours." Johnson scoffed as he leaned informally against his desk, and Bennett felt his blood pressure steadily rise at the lack of respect.\n\n"We can be so much stronger though, Mr Johnson.

We know that this has occurred because of the efforts of a coordinated Japanazi plot to replace our free republic with a National Socialist collectivist autocracy. They have carried out this plot through the use of their "useful idiots"; the integrationists, the NPP-L, the NPP-C, the Republican-Democratic Party and presidents Nixon and Eisenhower, all the Kennedy brothers and especially the family patriarch, and all those who have sought to weaken the United States through implementing liberal, communistic policies that will sow chaos and discord and leave us helpless before the Japanazi onslaught.\n\nThere is only one political leader in this country who I can say with complete confidence is not a part of this National Socialist conspiracy. That man is George C. Wallace. This man flew bombing missions against the Japanese in the war and never gave up that fight, not even after America was stabbed in the back by that Japanazi stooge President Truman at Akagi. He has now taken the anti-fascist and anti-communist struggle from the Pacific skies to the town halls of America, and is the lone voice speaking up for State's Rights, free speech, free enterprise, and all those rights which our Founding Fathers enshrined in the Constitution. He is not afraid to stand against the Nazi-created "Civil Rights movement" and its anti-constitutional demands and has wrested the National Progressive Party from the control of the Japanazi agents in the Center Bloc.\n\nWallace is the last and the best hope for the United States of America.

After a state funeral authorized by the President, he will be laid to rest in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nMacArthur has a contested and complicated legacy; he had served in France in the First World War, as Superintendent of West Point, served as part of the court-martial of General Billy Mitchell. After he was assigned to the Philippines, during which he became the youngest American Major General at the age of 44, and was appointed Army Chief of Staff in 1930, and after leaving that post was named the Field Marshal of the semi-independent Philippine Army in 1935. But his role in putting down the Bonus Army of WW1 veterans in 1932, and his failure to prevent the Japanese from occupying the Philippines left his reputation in tatters. It was the latter that resulted in his dismissal by President Joseph Kennedy, and has since been considered either the "man that lost the Pacific" or as a scapegoat for the failed American war effort against Japan. He used his new civilian role to try to rally the American people to fight the war, but his constant criticism of President's Kennedy and Harry Truman alienated him from politicians and the general public, especially when he made comments favorably admiring Asian cultures and peoples later in the war.\n\nThe General's detractors considered him egotistical, aloof and pretentious, while others called him courageous, intelligent, and inspiring. Many National Progressive Party members and leaders have long believed that MacArthur could have won the war against Japan had he been properly supported.

Other marches throughout the US have also taken place with similar demands to end the war and bring our soldiers home. The most striking image was the sight of thousands of men and women, in single file, carrying placards with the name of a dead or wounded American soldier, or a town or village in South Africa that had been destroyed, marching in single file down Pennsylvania Avenue, past the White House, before reaching the Capitol Building.\n\nThe Moratorium is a different kind of protest: it's not left-wing "hippies" denouncing the draft and leading to violence and riots. Instead, the South African Moratorium Committee sought support from "respectable" institutions like the civil rights movement, churches, university faculties, unions, business leaders, and politicians. Some of those that spoke in the big Washington march include Coretta Scott King, Dr. Benjamin Spock, David Dellinger, W. Averell Harriman, and Arthur Goldberg. One news reporter has called the marches taking place "...a sober, almost melancholy manifestation of middle class concern..."\n\nIt's difficult to say if the presence of so many thousands of everyday Americans will change the country's policy regarding South Africa, with some supporters of the President are claiming that the protests are actually a Nazi ploy, simply to undermine the efforts to fight fascism, a new "America First" committee to undermine the nation's democratic resolve. Some White House staffers are sure that a "silent majority" actually does support the President in the current path forward.

The mood is cheerful, even if they do not quite have the influence yet to begin pushing their agenda. Every man in the room can feel the change in the air. Their time may finally be coming.\n\nThe cracks are beginning to show, and from those cracks pour the forces of reaction. All across the country, these ideas are beginning to take root, and no longer are those who hold them afraid to hide it. Those who hoped that the rise of extreme thought was a passing phase grow increasingly nervous, and it remains to be seen how much further such ideology will spread."

USA.flavor.9.t:0 "The Rot"
USA.flavor.9.desc:0 "In a Southern town, a band of white-robed figures marches through the streets in numbers not seen in decades. Openly, loudly, proudly, they proclaim their defence of the White race against those who they say would destroy it. Once, they would have been greeted with counter-demonstrators. Now, they march unimpeded. The Klan's enemies stay away now, ever since the clash which saw three dead and twenty four beaten to within an inch of their lives. No longer do the town's police protect the Klan's enemies from harm. No longer do the police hide their allegiance to the Klan.\n\nIn an idyllic clearing in the Appalachian woodlands, all is quiet, save for the wind. As the gust begins to quicken, a slight tapping joins the fray. It is the gentle tapping of a Black man's boots against a tree as he hangs from its branch. Suddenly, a second tapping joins him, from the body hanging on the next tree. This one is not Black. Those who seek to cleanse their community of the other have seen fit to hang a Jew this time. They are the third and fourth men to be hanged in that forest in a week. They will not be the last.\n\nIn Washington D.C. there is a disquiet. Where before there would be the veneer of civility from even the staunchest segregationist, now there is open contempt. Those who call for equality and greater government clarity are loudly decried as traitors by the backbenches of the NPP.  Ideas once confined to the Volkshalle now openly circle within the chambers of Capitol Hill. Cornerstones of American democracy, such as the notion that all men are created equal and that all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, are now being brought into question by the faction of Francis Parker Yockey.\n\nA rot has set in at America's heart. Even in Jim Crow's heyday, never before was there such a sense that hatred was the way of the world. Before, it was quiet. Now, slowly, the fury begins to build. Very soon, it could erupt into a scream of hatred, and all of America might be consumed by it."

USA_IR.1.t:0 "이란 내전"
USA_IR.1.d:0 "In recent years, we have seen Persia become a wide breeding ground for oppression and ruthless authoritarianism during the rule of Pahlavi. Pressures from Berlin and Tokyo have caused a cave-in for the fragile political structure of the once-proud nation. However, the people have started to speak out against tyranny, and our shining opportunity is developing itself right before our eyes. The National Front, formerly outlawed under the Shah's one-party dynasty, has made a resurgence in the local population, and every class seems to show its support: farmers, soldiers, and noblemen alike. In a surprising referendum directed at the parliament, the people demanded free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, among others. The result? Over two hundred "freedom fighters" dead, over a thousand wounded. Angered at this sight, democratic politicians continued to speak out against the Shah, all while building up a competent army in the southern half of the country along the Zagros Mountains and the Persian coast. A constitution was signed and the new Republic of Iran seceded only a few hours ago.\n\nPersia is the gate through which the Caucasus, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East can be accessed. We also don't want the barbaric German eagle spreading his talons over the oil reserves in Iran. With a friendly government, any chance the Germans have at filling up their Panzers with Persian oil is slim. If the Liberals win this conflict, they could be our "experiment" with democracy in the region, a beacon of hope for the peoples of the Middle East. We must be hasty; the frail democracy is already on the defensive."
USA_IR.1.a:0 "Yet another struggle for freedom is all we need."
USA_IR.2.t:0 "The Iranian Aid Bill"
USA_IR.2.d:0 "Just this morning, Congress passed the Iranian Aid Bill with an acceptable majority, giving us the power to send volunteers and military advisers to the National Front forces. Until our equipment can reach the Persian coast, we have invested $100 million to keep the Liberals fighting. Furthermore, this bill ensures our lasting cooperation with the Republic of Iran, and we are now committed to keeping the candle lit for as long as possible.\n\nAlready, as the money flows into the newly established nation, the locals have been praising us for our swift efforts. We have also been getting positive reports from the population here, and it seems people are more eager to combat oppression in Iran than in any other war in the past decade. We cannot fail the public now."
USA_IR.2.a:0 "Quite the lending hand to a faraway land"
USA_IR.3.t:0 "Grand Strategy of the Iran War"
USA_IR.3.d:0 "Our generals are currently divided over our potential policy for the war ahead. Two options were given: we either send our own men into combat to directly influence the course of the war, or we supply the National Front from a distance and let the Iranians be the ones fighting.\n\nThe advisers supporting direct involvement argue that offensives will be carried out quicker and that results will be seen much faster. Our troops are much more trained and ready than the Liberal troops. Americans may die on the battlefield but the overall number of casualties will be lower than if we only sent weapons. Officers supporting indirect involvement claim that if the U.S. Army lands on Persian soil, it could bring Germany or Japan into the conflict, and that is certainly not in our best interests. The public isn't showing support for this kind of intervention either, and it would take a resounding victory to even dent their disapproval.\n\nThe advisers supporting indirect involvement claim that, first and foremost, less Americans will be sacrificed for freedom. We can trust that the Iranians are capable of using the latest technologies we have to offer. The introduction of our arsenal is enough of a boost for the National Front troops. The Germans and Japanese are less likely to intervene if we only send supplies. Critics believe this will produce a larger death toll and the war will be drawn out longer.\n\nWe either send troops and risk it all or we trust the National Front to take care of the job using our technology."
USA_IR.3.a:0 "IRANIAN Men need to die for freedom"
USA_IR.3.b:0 "Men need to die for freedom"
USA_IR.4.t:0 "Long Term or Short Term?"
USA_IR.4.d:0 "Military plans are nearly complete, and high-ranking officers are again at a crossroads. This time, the U.S. must decide whether its soldiers will attempt a swift advance to end the war or prepare for the long haul war of attrition. If we send enough soldiers in to overwhelm the enemy, there is a clear chance the war would end once Tehran capitulates. However, if this advance fails, there will be a monumental loss of American life, and the war might as well be lost. It is a big risk, but if our troops can pull it off, the war will be won handily and we have our Middle Eastern ally.\n\nAlternatively, we can expect the long-term war from the start and try to wear down our foe over time. The war may be longer, but we would have no risk of failing and embarrassing ourselves on the world stage again. At the same time, there would be no chance of a swift victory. This route allows for a greater conservation of resources and all our soldiers would have to do is hold out longer. The idea may not sit well with the average soldier, but it is meant to keep him safe.\n\nIn conclusion, our military either risks the entire operation on one single offensive, or we hold everything in the trenches and wait for the enemy to attack us. It is a matter of offensive or defensive; risk or no risk. Time is not of the essence."
USA_IR.4.a:0 "We'll take a chance with this war."
USA_IR.4.b:0 " Prepare the trenches immediately."
USA_IR.6.t:0 "The Liberals Lose in Iran"
USA_IR.6.d:0 "An American soldier stands in the midst of the waiting party preparing to leave Iran. Looking up, helicopters whirr by, a helicopter following too far behind is blasted to pieces. It was the final moment of action he would ever see out of Iran. "The public won't be happy with this," he laments, remembering how his closest friend was shot in the head, left to die, as his division withdrew from the front lines. The two had become friends in a deep Georgia training camp seven years ago. Both had older brothers who faced hell in South Africa.\n\n"How could we just... give up on this war?"\n\nAmerican forces held time and time again, but any offensive they tried just couldn't break through the rough enemy defenses. Once the U.S. lost enough men, generals made the quick decision to pull out and leave the war solely to the Liberals. Not even a day after the last U.S. soldier left Iran did the National Front sign a peace agreement. The leaders of the movement were subsequently executed by firing squad.\n\nThe public did not greet the returning soldiers with the respect they were promised. Many were spat on and some were even attacked. Nevertheless, our soldiers did the best they could to promote freedom abroad, and those who made the ultimate sacrifice will be given a proud funeral. The fall of the Iranian National Front marks the end of any hope for democracy in the Middle East. The dream of liberty has escaped the hearts of Iranians, never to be seen again."
USA_IR.6.a:0 "Iran was simply a mistake."
USA_IR.7.t:0 "The Liberals Win in Iran"
USA_IR.7.d:0 "It is finally over. We have successfully lifted the Liberal faction above all its enemies, and the fascists and communists remaining are being dealt with as we speak. Though we suffered significant casualties, what matters is that we finally have a partner in the Middle East that we can count on. Negotiations with the new government have started and we believe they will continue promoting our cause as long as we help them rebuild.\n\nA handful of our soldiers remain in the country to subdue any rebel factions that could harm Iranian leadership. Since Tehran also suffered serious damage, our engineers chose to stay behind so that the city would be rebuilt. In accordance with the Iranian Aid Bill, we have also sent economic and industrial advisers to the new government.\n\nThe rebuilding of Iran will take time, but when it is complete, our sole ally in the Middle East will be even more formidable than it was before the war. The torch of liberty shines brighter than ever before in Asia."
USA_IR.7.a:0 "We can only hope it stays lit."

 USA.culture.1.desc:0 "케네디가의 대변인은 오늘 조지프 P. 케네디 전 대통령이 81세로 매사추세츠 주의 자택에서 별세했다고 밝혔습니다. 그는 아내와 여섯 명의 자녀를 남겨두고 떠났습니다.\n\n아버지 케네디는 복잡한 유산을 남겼습니다. 케네디 왕조의 가주로서 그의 성공은 상당한 것이었는데, 그의 아들 존, 로버트, 에드워드가 모두 정치 영역에서 이름을 날렸기 때문입니다. 케네디 장로는 1932년에 대통령으로 선출되었고 대공황으로부터 미국을 느리게 회복시켰습니다. 경제와 외교 정책 모두에서 그의 비간섭주의적 정책에 대한 심각한 비판에도 불구하고, 그는 1936년에 연임했습니다.\n\n이 두 번째 임기는 주로 케네디가 유럽 전쟁에 계속 개입하기를 꺼려하고, 미국이 일본이나 독일에 대한 세계적 전력 투사를 전혀 준비하지 못한 것에 의해 정의되었습니다. 케네디는 그의 대통령직의 후폭풍으로 많은 비난을 받는데, 그의 그의 후임자인 해리 트루먼에 의한 영국 개입의 실패와 아카기 협정의 서명 이후에 비판이 더 증가하였습니다. 민주당은 그의 아들 존 F. 케네디가 리차드 닉슨의 불명예 이후 대통령이 되기 전까지 20년동안 백악관의 문을 열지 못했습니다.\n\n케네디는 대통령직에서 은퇴한 후 태평양 상공의 폭격으로 그의 아들 조 Jr.를 잃는 등의 사건이 있으면서 몇 년을 보냈고, 그후 그의 아들의 부통령 후보 선출을 돕기 위해 다시 등장했습니다. 하지만, 아버지 케네디는 일본과 맞서기 위한 독일과의 데탕트를 옹호하는 발언을 한 것에 대한 광범위한 비판 때문에 세간의 주목을 받지 못했고, 1964년 그의 아들 로버트의 대통령 선거에 도움을 주지 않았습니다.\n\n미국인들이 그를 어떻게 기억하든, 케네디는 미국 역사에 영구적인 흔적을 남겼고 그의 가족은 가까운 미래에 정치에서 중요한 역할을 계속 할 것입니다."

Then transport it, under armed guard, with motorcades, block traffic and more, to deliver it to the ship to take it on it's trip across the Atlantic.

With the Oil War and hardships it brought, America's tastes have finally shifted in full towards fuel economy and cost.\n\nThe now-venerable Mustang would have suffered the same fate as its fellow burdensome beasts were it not for the haste of its parent company's engineers. Plans were made in Dearborn to accommodate the gasoline rations and reigning economic slump to their car's design: Lengths and widths were cut short, gas-guzzling V8s replaced with compact I4s, and frames modified to reduce noise and vibration as its dimensions shrink. Drawing from their failures with the Pinto, Ford set out to effectively downsize their flagship muscle car into a form suiting the American family's increasingly tight purses.\n\nThe end result is the second-generation Mustangs, or the Mustang IIs, released with aplomb today. Seemingly satisfied with this compromise between economy and style, men with means have gone out to purchase Ford's new-old car in droves.

Critics from the Chicago Sun-Times have regarded the movie as being "a brilliant showcasing of the depth of investigative journalism, as paranoia, self-doubt, and harassment dominate the cases of the heroes of the Washington Post." The movie soared to reach a cemented number one spot at the box office as Americans rushed to see the political thriller.\n\nDirector Alan J. Pakula provides the American audience a journey across the spheres of journalism, writing, and politics as the film looks into the journeys of renowned reporting duo Katharine Graham and David Halberstam as they take on the haunting shadows which peer over their every move. Together, the duo follows one step after another in the journey to unveil a secretive and dangerous conspiracy involving the White House administration, scaling all the way up to former President Richard Nixon himself, who, just two years ago, resigned from his office as President of the United States. Graham and Halberstam served as writing leads behind the movie itself, with Graham stating that "David and I wanted to deliver a trek through the perils that came with the Nixon scandal as we had experienced: terrifying, back-breaking, and, well, exhilarating. As every time we felt our hearts' racing, we wanted the audience to feel that rush just the same."\n\nThat being said, key figures within the Republican-Democrat Party have come forward in criticism of the movie, with the Republican-Democrats stating that "it puts a hole through our work in trying to help the United States." Meanwhile, spokespersons within the National Progressive Party have stated their "appreciation within Graham, Halberstam, and Pakula's work." Nevertheless, despite political experts' criticism, the American audience has driven in scores to theaters across the country to enjoy the "film of the decade," as some have called it."

McMurphy, a veteran of Scotland and proud street brawler, is sentenced to time in a psychiatric hospital for battery and illicit gambling. There, he meets a number of characters, including the novel's narrator, "Chief" Bromden, and the tyrannical head nurse, Nurse Ratched. Over the course of the novel, McMurphy challenges Ratched's rule, standing up for himself and the other patients in the ward. He is rewarded for this with a lobotomy, courtesy of Ratched. The novel ends with Bromden smothering McMurphy in an act of mercy, before escaping to freedom.\n\n"Cuckoo's Nest" has already garnered its fair share of accolades and controversy alike. Many are calling it a portrayal of America's own authoritarian systems, in an age when the nation is supposedly a bastion of liberty in the world.

Brian Wilson and Melcher were stabbed multiple times to death, while Marilyn and Lindsay were found shot dead on the back porch, likely attempting to flee. Dennis Wilson's body was far more heinously killed compared to the others: he was shot in both his knees, his abdomen was stabbed over four dozen times, and his face was severely disfigured by blunt trauma.

Manson was already in LAPD custody for an unrelated petty crime when he was charged. His cult of followers, colloquially known as his "Family," earlier caught the FBI's attention for their leader's support of Francis Parker Yockey and preaching a bizarre synthesis of messianic apocalypticism and white supremacy. When questioned if his beliefs motivated the crime, Manson claimed that the murders were "all personal" and unrelated to his plans to "Wake the World"-his prophesied race war with its name taken from a Beach Boys song. According to Manson, Wilson adapted the lyrics to his song "Cease to Exist" without crediting him and deserved retribution.\n\nA court date is set, and a conviction is all but guaranteed due to band member Mike Love's agreement to testify after emerging from a coma last week.

Among humanity, there exists no prejudice or hatred, and the crew of the Enterprise, in addition to having several alien representatives aboard, has crewmembers from America, Germany, Russia, Japan, and Africa.\n\nMany Americans and watchers abroad have found this vision of a glorious future for humanity to be a breath of fresh air in a sobering, dark reality. While some may say that such a bright vision is unrealistic, few can argue that it provides a glimmer of hope and in a world where such a resource is in desperately short supply."

 USA.culture.44.desc:0 "The man on stage seemed to warp and then reform as he felt the strings of his guitar. Dozens of other men and women stood shirtless beside Eli as the sharp, echoing sound of an electric guitar colored the morning air. There was a raucous of noise and yells that seemed to blend into the background, in the same way that Eli almost felt himself blend into the hot, faceless mass of the crowd. People weren't quite so into it as they had been a few days ago, on Friday, but when Jimi Hendrix strummed that alabaster work of art, silence lay like a shadow.\n\nThe notes continued, and Eli felt his skin vibrate with goosebumps. Muscles wanted to pulse and groove in waves with the rhythm, but it was already clear this was not dancing music. He could almost hear the lyrics in his head, even though Jimi wasn't singing. The words of the Star-Spangled Banner seemed to be crushed or torn apart by Jimi's occasional bouts of speed followed by echoing, drawn-out chords. Eli wasn't entirely sure how much of this extraordinary performance was imagined, but he felt every little twist and riff ripple in his head and in his soul.\n\nJimi switched from somber, more connected-feeling chords into wild riffs and solos seemingly on a whim. Eli's eyes remained locked on the guitarist, and the rest of the world seemed to just melt away in whorls of color. Finally, it seemed like the hard and fast playing was beginning to morph into something more akin to what Eli knew and loved. Eli prayed that the Star and Stripes he saw in his mind's eye would never leave. He loved his country, he loved this place, and he hoped he would never have to leave."
