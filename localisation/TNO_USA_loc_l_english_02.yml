Adolf Hitler, supreme ruler of the Third Reich, passed away at age 73 in the leadup to his birthday. Previous CIA reports indicated that his health had been failing in recent years, but the crisis of the past years seems to have done him in for good.\n\nIn America, and much of the rest of the world, the mood is in stark contrast to that of Germany. Spontaneous celebrations have broken out In Washington, in New York, in the south, in the west, all across the country. Even in the occupied ports of Los Angeles and San Francisco, American workers and Japanese soldiers agree that Hitler's death is something worth celebration. Publicly, President Nixon has not commented, but privately, he has been reported as 'elated'.\n\nHowever, it does appear that Hitler was the sole thing holding the Reich together. The NSA has intercepted numerous communications from within Germany, indicating that a conflict is imminent.\n\nThere is something more to add.

CIA assets in Germania have reported that shortly after celebrations over the moon landing began to settle, German military units and several platoons worth of the German dictator's various bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. From what we are hearing, an assassin, which the Germans claim had belonged to the Japanese Kempeitai, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards, and killed on the spot.\n\nAlready, reports of several assassinations have surfaced, as various politicians in the Reichstag initially believed Hitler to have been killed and began long-planned plots to eliminate their rivals in the chaos. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as various units ordered one other to stand down and the chain of command broke down.\n\nWhile the situation has begun to recover, martial law is still in effect in Germania, and suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. In Washington, this raises the question - how can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?"

 USA.34.desc:0 "Ever since he became a grandmaster at the age of 15, Bobby Fischer has solidified his position as perhaps the strongest chess player alive. After his unanimous victory in the 1969 Chess Championship against Bent Larsen of Denmark, he has been considered by many observers as the greatest American grandmaster of all time, and has achieved the highest ELO rating in recorded history. But his brilliancy has not gone without controversy, and the chess community has descended into chaos after he has recently refused to defend his title against Germany.\n\nFollowing his perfect victory in the 1963 US Championship, Fischer has made multiple fascist and pro-German statements, becoming an official member of the extreme right of the National Progressive Party. He has openly described himself as a Yockey, and has made numerous racist statements towards the Japanese and has undergone virulent anti-semitic triades during tournaments, despite him being half-Jewish himself, a label which he passionately rejects. In this year's 1972 Chess Championship, held in Reykjavík, Iceland, he has verbally attacked both the United States and FIDE, culminating in him surrendering the chance for him to play against Klaus Darga of Germany, automatically awarding him the new world champion by default.\n\nHe has answered to the press's questioning with "I refuse to let my name be associated with that of Jewish deceit... I would rather be branded a traitor by you FIDE degenerates than to go against another intellectually superior Aryan of my own blood." It appears as if he will continue to stir discontent if we let him say what he wants to say. What should we do?"

However, upon arrival, he instead entered a government office where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich. After a short internment, the Führer announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and his decision to forfeit from the championship. The rumours of his half-Jewish ancestry seemed to have been overlooked by authorities. He has confirmed to the press that his emigration is permanent, citing recent actions to "silence" him by the American government.\n\nAlthough some are graceful that we will no longer have to deal with that little shit's mouth anymore, the game's community has mourned the loss of our finest player nevertheless. In the Reich, Fischer has been appointed a personal instructor for him to learn Deutsch, and already has current champion Klaus Darga gave him the go-ahead to play with him against the United States in 1975. With no hope in winning FIDE's next competition, this intellectual battlefield, however minor, has been conclusively lost to fascism. What we have sacrificed may have been just a pawn, but every piece matters as the game unfolds..."

Yesterday, he boarded a small plane to Bavaria, claiming to have been contested by a local club. However, upon arrival he instead entered a foreign ministry where he renounced his citizenship to the United States and declared allegiance to the Reich, offering to play for our cause in the future.\n\nUpon being notified of the grandmaster's internment, the Führer has personally announced him welcome, praising him for his outspoken remarks and appointing him a private instructor for him to learn Deutsch. All those foolish enough to wish to challenge him will now have to do so within our borders. Although there exists rumours that Fischer is half-Jewish himself, we have decided to believe his own claim that he descends from German blood only. In the meantime, Fischer has considered developing his own chess variant for our own people, "Überchess." With Darga agreeing to play with him against the United States in 1975, we are now certain of our dominance over the game's global scene. The rest of the chess world now perpetually belongs in our check."

If Africa falls, next falls India, then with the east secured, the Nazis will soon be in the Americas as well!\n\nAt least, this is the sentiment that every American general with a foot in the White House door has loudly shouted, berated the Senate over, rallied their troops with and harassed the media with as seemingly every man who has ever held a gun has proclaimed the time for a 'final battle' against the fascist menace.\n\nWhile many members of the Republican-Democrat party have seemed nervous over the situation, proposing some doubts that this 'Domino Theory' is as immediate a threat as proposed, or that entering war with direct servants of the Reich can end in anything besides a greater conflict, it is most surprising that several members of the NPP have stepped across the Senate aisle to agree. Leftists in the NPP have questioned what, exactly, the R-D dominated military establishment proposes as any end goal in this conflict, and what plan they may have to deal with Africa even if there is some sort of victory, while the far right of the party has showed some suspicious hesitance to do battle with the fascists.\n\nRegardless, however, the President seems dead-set on an intervention in the South African conflict, with President Nixon seemingly hoping that a knockout punch on the Reich Commissioners will save his flagging administration and halt the impending impeachment vote."

Worst of all the ANC now enjoys a wide base of support, both from the native African population and whatever is left of the old reichskommissarat forces.\n\nSouth Africa's garrisons have proven ineffective at containing the ANC rebels within their zone of administration. As they are often misled into traps by local African villagers, and despite the harsh reprisals such actions engender they show no signs of stopping. The local regions around South African garrisons are slowly transformed into wastelands patroled by brutal military patrols, for some, it is as the Rechiskommisarats never left.\n\nAs it stands South Africa is slowly taking the place of the old German colonies, both domestically and abroad. Anti-war protests continue, and now focus exclusively on the multitudes of war crimes committed by our supposed allies"

 USA.130.desc_cr_passed:0 "The National Progressive Party Convention concluded today with a rather surprising outcome. After multiple ballots, with candidates representing each of the many factions of the party over the whole spectrum of politics including Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson, a clear winner emerged: George Wallace.\n\nThe controversial Alabama Governor, with his well known and outspoken views on segregation and support for the Jim Crow laws of the Southern states, focused most of his primary campaign not on the debates about Civil Rights, but on the corruption of the current Republican-Democrat Administration and the increasing power of the federal government. He successfully torpedoed RFK's leadership bid by honing on the single fact that he was the former campaign manager for Nixon, and the brother and Chief of Staff of John F. Kennedy. So how did the corruption and rot go, and would it infect yet another Kennedy's Presidential ambitions? Enough delegates and the convention were convinced that it would, thus handing the nod to Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, the Governor spoke not simply as running as President for the South, but for all of America. "I intend to give the American people a clear choice. I welcome a fight between our philosophy and the corruption and heavy handedness of Washington, telling us what to do, what to think, which now threatens to engulf every man, woman, and child in the United States. I am in this race because I believe the American people have been pushed around long enough and that they, like you and I, are fed up with the continuing trend toward a corrupt Banana Republic which now subjects the individual to the dictates of an all-powerful central government."\n\nWallace has great support in the Southern states, and pockets of support in coservative enclaves who despise the increasing power of government in their lives, and millions more that just want to banish the corrupt and dirty politics of Nixon to the history book as fast as possible. It just remains to be seen if this can translate into victory in November."

After multiple ballots, with candidates representing each of the many factions of the party including George Wallace, Micheal Harrington and Scoop Jackson, a clear winner emerged: Robert Francis Kennedy.\n\nHow "Bobby" Kennedy, the brother and Chief of Staff of former President John F. Kennedy, and the seventh of nine children of former President Joseph P. Kennedy, and was President Nixon's campaign manager in 1960 and who took the nation at storm with an explosive speech criticizing the party of his father and brother for failing to live up to the people, became the standard bearer of the opposition party just four years later is still a shock that many are trying to come to terms with. Perhaps it was the sidelining of his brother as scandal engulfed the White House, or perhaps to simply make a clean break from the corruption of the current Administration and of his own past to serve his nation. The true answer may be that Robert was infuriated with the President's vetoing of the Civil Rights Act, stalling, if not ending the dream of equality for all races. This issue, which RFK has championed since he first got into politics, managed to obliterate his closest competitor, the segregationist Governor Wallace.\n\nIn his victory speech, Robert Kennedy made his support for Civil Rights adamant. "We must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of God command it, although they do; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do."\n\nAlready RFK has great support across the nation: from African-Americans seeking to end the terrors of Jim Crow, blue collar workers that see him as their strongest advocate, progressives wishing to make the US a more equal society, and millions more that just want to banish the corrupt and dirty politics of Nixon to the history book as fast as possible.

In 160 pages of detailed, emotionally-charged narrative, he accounts the lives and aftermath of six Hawaiian-American civilians who survived the atomic blast. The Japanese cruisers landed on their shores scarcely a week later, and forced them to stay on the islands, calmly telling them that if they want the charred corpses of their families to rest in peace, they will have to bury them themselves. "The six of them all share one pain: they envy the dead," Hersey wrote.\n\nOver one million Americans, still reeling after the horror of the atom was revealed to them only two years prior, opened up their Saturday morning magazines, expecting comforting satire and laughter. But as they read its prose, all they felt was their hearts suffocating with sorrow and dread towards the nuclear holocaust Germany and Japan now ceaselessly march towards.\n\nIt is twenty years later, and America opens up another special edition of The New Yorker to find the same horror once again, now directed towards the crimes of our own nation. Sprawled across the first page is an aerial photograph of hundreds of mutilated corpses strewn out across a river flowing with blood, all positioned in the shape of a massive swastika. The perpetrators have been confirmed to be a U.S. Army company, who, deployed to search a village in the deep rainforest, were allegedly ambushed by a group of unidentified combatants while crossing the Orange River. Fueled by rage, the officers ordered for the bodies of the fallen to be rearranged into the symbol of hate.\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland's own attache conservatively estimates that the composition was made out of 347 stormtroopers that attempted to capture and torture the infantry division. Rejecting this, anti-war activist Tom Hayden's private correspondents assert that the photo was composed of 504 unarmed Boer settlers who happened to walk in the direction of the death squad's nightly patrol. We have yet to receive an official statement from any German authorities that isn't composed entirely of vague, slur-riddled insults.\n\nThe article begins with the suicide letter of Private First Class Varnado Simpson, who hanged himself from guilt on March 16th, hours after the massacre.

A brittle, freezing wind has been blowing down all day from the north, cutting through the long coats and pillbox hats of the assembled dignitaries. But those dignitaries aren't his people. His people are gathered below the stage.\n\nThere are students, from the august heights of Columbia to America's vast networks of community colleges and state schools. There are activists and organizers, fighting for dignity, for justice, for a fair shake, in the fields of the Central Valley and the streets of Harlem. There are union men and women, proudly paying their dues and giving management the middle finger. They are gathered in front of the Capitol, stretching past the Supreme Court, past the Folger Library, sprawling across the city laid out for democracy.\n\nAround the world, people watch with hesitancy. In Germania and Tokyo, tyrants whisper about the best ways to subvert him. In capitals across South America, people wonder if the stick-waving Yankees really are finding a new way. Across America, millions watch the spectacle. Some love him. Some hate him. Some aren't quite sure yet. But all are waiting to see what he does. A change is coming to the country, and President-Elect Michael Harrington is about to usher it in.\n\nAt least, those seven hundred thousand hope he will."

In 46 years of life, he had been blessed with many momentous occasions: flying his first combat mission over the Marshall Islands, careening towards the stars on Friendship 7, even quitting NASA after Nixon cut its funding. However, all of those life-changing events seemed trivial as a host of his countrymen stared in admiration as he slipped his hands off of that pristine little bible upon which he swore the oath of office. Now, millions keenly watched him standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial to hear his first words as President; words that would define the fate of his country and possibly all of mankind.\n\n"Today, we as a nation are brought together not to celebrate the victory of a man, but of a movement and an idea. We celebrate the idea that our homeland is indeed a great society; one unsullied by war, or autocracy, or depression. We celebrate and reaffirm our dedication to freedom, democracy, and the self-determination of all peoples. To make our celebrated ideals into appreciable ones, we must begin anew as a people, just as the world begins anew with the changing of the age and the passing of the generational torch..."\n"...This new page of human history has brought with it many innovations and yet more uncertainties. From these innovations have spawned both terrors and wonders, some of which with the potential to save mankind, and yet others with the capability to destroy it. To truly be a great and freedom-loving society, we must not appreciate those creations of man that implants a balance of terror upon the whole of the species; rather, we should celebrate and develop those creations which may yet bring us to the depths of the oceans, or the distant light of the stars."\n\nPresident Glenn stood slightly taller as tens of thousands of once-dreary, blank faces erupted into smiles and cheers and applause. Through one-hundred-and-forty-nine combat missions, three trips to space, two governorships of Ohio, and a presidential election, he had followed the tides and turns of his life and his country.

Aides, secretaries, and even a few senators, all sitting in pure silence as the low hum of the television and its tinny speakers recite the unfortunate news.

So far, no one has said a word, aside from a few curt greetings. H.R. Haldeman breaks the palpable silence, "I think we all know why we're here. Our friend in Guyana has gone too far, we need to do something about it."\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury, Robert McNamara, follows Haldeman's lead and speaks next, Nixon still bearing an angry yet contemplative look. "The press doesn't know our involvement in his election. We need to threaten constricting economic ties. Sanctions, condemnations, and diplomatic isola-"\n\n"-frankly, Bob, he'll get trade from somewhere else. Hell, when Germany gets back on its feet we'll all be in trouble because that's where he'll get it from.

If we threaten him, he'll double down on his opposition. Any MP of theirs he suspects might turn against him will face retribution. We can't top that, if only for moral reasons."\n\nSlowly the room evolves into conflicting arguments, various cabinet members arguing for an exile army, others for isolation. Suddenly, a voice cuts through the clamor. "That's enough!"\n\nThe head of the table has spoken. Richard Nixon stands, and then speaks, "I don't care about it either way, I just want the press and Burnham, both, to calm the hell down! Force him, pressure him, it doesn't matter.

Unlike yesterday, the Presidential Cabinet is not assembled in its near-entirety. Only McNamara, Haldeman, Nixon, and Kennedy are in the boardroom.\n\n"Well," McNamara says, "I guess we've got to do it the hard way. Ball's in your court, Jack."\n\n"I'll make the call."\n\nKennedy makes the move to get up, but Nixon raises a hand. Turning around, he scans his eyes over the room, "Who says we have to do anything?"\n\nHaldeman raises an eyebrow, "Dick, he's executing people, we can't let this slide, not with the press on our backs like they are now."\n\n"Since when are we so high and mighty? We've supported men like Burnham in the past, and even if we ignore this, we still have plausible deniability."\n\n"I don't think this is a good idea," Kennedy says, placing a hand on Nixon's shoulder, "I think we owe it to the people of Guyana to help them."\n\nHaldeman looks over to McNamara, who shrugs, "Gotta tell you Bob, I agree with Dick on this one."\n\nHaldeman looks at Nixon, "Well Dick, you're the president.""

As he stood before the crowd, however, he knew that now was the time for tact, not boorishness, and so he put aside his usual bravado for the time being.\n\n"Unity is the first and foremost principle of our American union. For we who are small and few against the forces of tyranny, our continued liberty must derive from commonality and the strength of our collective will to endure. Yet true unity cannot be derived from a nation at odds with itself. It is this that I believe is what a Great Society must truly strive for, and what we have endeavored to strive for these past few years. No longer need capitalist and worker nor farmer and clerk struggle against one another, for we may now stand shoulder to shoulder in the interests of increasing the bounty of all...\n\n"...from the many great tragedies of the last few decades, the spirit of one great indivisible nation stands unblemished. It is my hope that this spirit may never be extinguished, and it is my earnest wish to continue to protect and nurture this spirit. We are a nation of liberty and justice, blessed by God, and it is our duty to struggle with toil and tears to ensure that the light of our nation shines on. On my part, I promise to you now what I promised the men of my party on that sorrowful day in 1963 - 'I will lead and I will do the best I can'."\n\nOnce more, the crowd roared with appreciation. President Johnson was not a sentimental man, but even he felt the stirrings of pride in his heart. Once more, he had a duty to these people, and it was his solemn oath to fulfil that duty. Four more years lay in front of him, and there was still a lot of work to do. Through the efforts of the Great Society and the efforts of the American people, America was sure to emerge ever greater, and ever more united against all that would seek to tear it down both from within, and without."

Now, as he gazed out into the assembled thousands who had come to see him, he knew that hope was no longer daring. It was natural, open, loud and proud. In their faces - the men and women, the white man and the black, the Jew and the gentile - he could see for the first time an America that wanted the future to arrive. He beamed as he stepped up to the podium, letting the roaring cheers wash over him. Deep down, he dearly hoped that John was watching, wherever he was.\n\n"We stand here today in the name of liberty and justice. At the heart of western democracy is the belief that all men are created equal, and so the extension of this belief and the enlargement of liberty for all must be the supreme goal of a western society. Others have turned from this goal, and marched on into darkness and decay. Yet where they have faltered, we have pressed forwards, and in four short years we have extended the branch of freedom and human rights to all, no matter their race, their color or their stature in life...\n\n...but as in all things, justice is never final. To walk the path to a better future is to walk a path without end. There will be those who will try to steer us from the path, and those who insist that we have walked far enough. We must always recognize the fact that the work to better fulfil the promise that our God-given country was founded upon shall never be finished. We must keep walking, keep improving, and keep striving to create a true land of liberty that will shine bright in a world of darkness."\n\nPresident Kennedy smiled even brighter as the crowd applauded. He knew that he could not grow complacent. There were still those who would try to stop him from doing what truly needed to be done. Yet knowing that the majority of America was with him made him all the more resolute in his ambitions. His dream, John's dream, the American Dream would be realised for the sake of those smiling faces before him. He would fight for all of them and fight against any who would stand in his way, and he would do it all gladly, not because it was easy..."

That was all the motivation he needed to steel himself for the coming term.\n\n"Four years ago, I came to you as an insurgent. I stood as a lone voice in resistance against those who would seek to erode our great Anglo-Saxon identity. You, the people of our God-blessed United States, stood up and joined me, and together we secured the future of our culture and our liberty against those who would risk it all in the name of 'progress.' Now, once again you have placed your faith in me, and I vow in the name of God the Almighty that I shall execute your will...\n\n...there are still those among us who would choose to squander the many boons they have been given in the name of naive idealism. I hope that after today they will re-evaluate their position. You and I together have shown them the true will of the people, and our will will not be silenced. In the name of freedom, and in the name of the true American way, we will stand firm against that which would seek to divide us!"\n\nThe crowd roared, equal parts cheers from the front and boos from the back. Countless banners waved furiously in the wind, be they the Stars and Stripes, state flags or the Confederate battle flag. Wallace grinned with pride as he gazed upon the myriad masses who had come from all over to see him. These were the men who had built America with their own hands, the women who had birthed and raised those men, and the children who would one day inherit the American legacy. With them on his side, the path ahead was clear.\n\nIt was time to finish the work."

The crowd before him applauded enthusiastically - many of them lifelong Democrats, some who had been briefly tempted away by the Right-NPP, and some who were new faces. All of them had come to him to lead them for four more years, and it was his good and honorable duty to give them what they wished for. There were some of his actions which many may call callous, but he did it all in the name of making America as strong and self-reliant as it needed to be to stare down the forces of evil lurking overseas.\n\n"The first and only duties of a nation's government must be to oversee the security of its people and to provide a hall in which the voice of the nation can be heard and debated. These past four years, we have worked to return our government to this core directive, shedding away the naivety of well-meaning men who bloated and extended the federal reach with their grandiose designs and passion projects. The true glory of this land lies not in what the government can do, but instead in what its people can do...\n\n...I promise to you, America, that we will continue to stand tall against a world of hatred. Our hearts and minds are stronger than the forces of fascism can ever comprehend. Through rugged determination, ingenuity, wit and cunning, we can continue to be a beacon of light upon this Earth. America is strong, and its people are stronger still, and we must never let our determination to better ourselves ever waver."\n\nGoldwater allowed himself a small smile as the cheers washed over him. He had much to be proud of after all. With a strong military that the fascists would never dare challenge, a responsible people who would look to their own betterment, and a government that would not have the power to take from the people as much as they gave away, he was securing the future of the American nation. It was a future that, if his victory was anything to go by, was one that the people were quite looking forward to."

In four years, he had helped to create a new legacy of spaceflight that had inspired millions of Americans, all while bettering the lot of the people back down on Earth. As he stood before the people once more, he prepared himself for the tasks ahead, in the hopes of taking America to even greater heights.\n\n"These turbulent decades have not been kind to the American nation, yet we have pressed ahead. We have emerged from a time of darkness and uncertainty into a new era of hope, progress and scientific understanding. Ever since the first pilgrims set foot upon these shores, America has been a land of explorers. It is in our blood to go forth into the unknown and find a place for ourselves there. Today, we once more celebrate the spirit of our nation, and affirm that true knowledge and understanding cannot belong to one man alone, but to all men united in the desire of a better world...\n\n...the work cannot stop here. When man first created fire, he endeavored to improve further. He heated his forge and made steel. He boiled steam to drive his engines. He lit a pillar of light under himself and soared into the heavens. Each new discovery brought not only greater opportunities, but also a more bountiful quality of life for all. We too must embody this proud tradition. Our nation will continue to innovate, continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, and all will be made more prosperous for it."\n\nPresident Glenn gazed upwards as the crowd applauded. Even now, there were Americans up there, and his words would be heard even in their capsules floating above the Earth.

Perhaps they couldn't even afford the fare to come to Washington, or the depths of their poverty had made the prospect of working for the day far more important than coming out. Now, they were here. As he finished reciting the oath of office, he surveyed the assembled crowd and saw a people uplifted from their sorrows. The sight alone was more than enough a reward for his work, but he knew that he still had more to do.\n\n"It is often said that a chain is only so strong as its weakest link. So too is a nation only so great as its humblest man. When he and his kindred are stricken, and the nation does not rise to the task of uplifting him, it has effectively split itself in two. It is split between a loud nation of opulence and splendor, and a silent nation of want. For a nation to be great, it must not allow this fractured silence. Four years ago I stood before you and vowed to never allow this silence again, and now you the people stand before me, and you are no longer silent...\n\n...but it is not sufficient for the nation to plaster over the gaps. The cracks must truly be healed, and the inequalities of the nation truly addressed before the spectre can finally be slain. Let us go forth in the interests of the land, and of the people. Let us work to once and for all end want and misery in this country. Let us strive to fulfil the true potential of this nation and allow all to enjoy its bounty. America shall be truly one and indivisible, and never again shall we allow an invisible and impoverished world exist right beneath our noses!"\n\nWild applause greeted his closing remarks. President Harrington smiled, but he knew that words alone could not move a nation. Four years had been spent doing precisely what he had warned against, his efforts a mere bandage over the wound of want. Now he had four more years, and he had to make them count.

In Washington D.C. over $15 million in property damage has been accounted for, but order has largely been restored. Baltimore, where citizen's anger may have burned the hottest, has concluded its extraordinary use of heavily armed federal troops.\n\nThe protests and riots that broke out over President Nixon's use of the veto against civil rights legislation are slowly starting to die down, as a combination of apathy and repression slows their inertia. As the dust settles, historians and political scientists are examining the possibility that this outpouring of discontent marks the greatest social upheaval since the Civil War. Even as the violence on the street is decreasing rhetorical violence is increasing.\n\nMany Civil Rights moderates are outraged, but are afraid of being tied to the riots by future electoral opponents. A broader swath of opposition, from liberal Republicans to the NPP-Left, are decrying Nixon as the tyrant envisioned by the Founders. An open letter signed by a bevy of top academics castigated the Republican party for falling in with segregationists and cast the veto as the ugly vow of the unholy union between R and D. All signatories promised to leave the party and encourage others to do so as well. It's clear that the veto of the Civil Rights Act has hardened its proponents, and divided the country even further.

Hayes in return for ending Reconstruction and permitting the establishment of Jim Crow laws. Almost a century later, these laws stand unchanged across much of the South. Few thought the seventies would be a decade where the Allman Brothers Band were banned from performing in their home state, where the Negro Motorist Green Book would surpass 40 years of publication, and where men and women of separate races still face criminal prosecution for falling in love. Yet, thanks to decades of federal ambivalence to this injustice, and failure to pass a lasting Civil Rights Act, have allowed our nation's greatest shame to endure.\n\nBlack America's fury at their continued oppression has reached a boiling point. With Reverend King and his principles of nonviolent resistance being dead for almost a decade, many Blacks have turned to violence, organized or disorganized, as the only viable form of resistance. Segregated department stores hire armed guards to protect against vandalism, and Southern police have become increasingly militarized in order to quash the near-monthly riots in Black neighborhoods. In reaction, Southern Whites have been flocking to the Ku Klux Klan and other racist militias in order to brutalize Blacks who protest injustice. The Left-NPP declares themselves the only political force who truly fights for racial justice, Yockey claims to be the one man who can save White America from lawlessness, and many take their word for it.\n\nIf America does not make any progress on this crisis, it will only further deteriorate.

The men within paced about and spoke at length on the subjects one would expect; a laundering here, a fiefdom issue there, the latest quotas from the bosses. Everybody knew enough to make sure they didn't leave the wrong words hanging in the air for the wrong ears: shibboleths sprouted in the smoky mist. The Genovese branch of the Mafia hadn't clung to their yellowed halls of power on the East Coast by playing stupid. They certainly weren't going to start now.\n\nThe struggle at present wasn't one of power, but of its old friend, money. The New York joints had been busted up for a long while, and for a time the patrons had settled for what they could get. Depression years and the chaos of the Fifties had a way of killing any uptown pretensions. But now that America was recovering the old middle-class patrons were beginning to filter out, and ones even the Cosa Nostra deemed distasteful were moving in to take their place. The pimps were losing control of the situation on home turf. Something had to be done.\n\nAntony, Joe and Mark (not their real names) fiddled with the map of South Avenue on the table. A new joint, free of the putrid smell of the Old Town, would jazz up the revenues and act as a movement point for money, guns, information. Old trades, new venue, easy money.

Then the shoes opposite him trace the contours in lithe slips and end up in their original placing (by some arcane coincidence).\n\nMartin glares at him with visible annoyance. John looks down in sheepishness. The moment stretches taut, pulls apart and snaps. Martin bursts out laughing, tickled by something on John's face, and pulls him to himself. His face smells of smoke and aftershave.\n\nThe kiss is tart and startling in the dim neon. John pulls back with the old instincts of the Brooklyn boy who always knew how much of himself to show, and how much to hide. But today a part of him resists, and instead he stays. It's a raw comfort, and in the glittering sharpness of the moment it's all he has.\n\nMartin pulls away with some reluctance. The date has been brief, and even this hour has been snatched at great cost. They haven't much time. He takes John's arm and together they spin out of the little bar, their little dance studio. Their figures are quickly lost in the chaos and brilliance of the New York night, blending in neon-shaded phantoms before disappearing."

Barely anyone notices my scribbling notes in the corner; this corner of America is obscure, but it shares the tendency for aching introspection, abbreviated loneliness hammered out via cheap glass cups. Beyond the occasional whisper and the wordless glances, not much makes it out of the haze of anonymity, and long may it remain so - the haze is the only thing that separates this part of town from the moralizing glaze of the rest of America. It's the only thing that keeps it safe.\n\nAs I'm writing this, a pair of young men (in their twenties, perhaps?), one Latino, one Caucasian, are swerving to the aching beat of "Satisfaction". Their patterned shoes tap out a rhythm at once familiar and strange; just irregular enough to inject vitality while keeping pace with the beat. Their bodies trace patterns so bold they'd be scandalous anywhere else, but here in the trace of lips and hands on waists it achieves careworn familiarity, like an elderly seamstress fixing an old cardigan. If this had been a different country perhaps they would have become dancers. But the lipstick and the gaudy dresses they wear would kill their careers, and a lot more besides, in this one. America is home to the brave, but this land isn't free, not for some. Not yet.\n\nFor now there is the freedom of the swirl and curve of dance, the celebration of the joy of life in a world with so little else. Another man offers his hand, and I rise to dance. In the gentle rhythm and the smoky swirls I sense some vast and gentle ecstasy, and with every sway I come closer to its source."

But autumn is sweeping in, one chill breeze at a time.\n\nThe signs have been there for a long while; the Mayor's riding on the coattails of the Moral Cleanup movement sweeping the country, and the officers sent to do the collection duties (one calls it the offering bag, with only a hint of irony) from the Inn tell the bartenders of the Anti-Mafia Team they're forming in the back of the Metropolitan Department. It's not like the community they've formed here hasn't known the wrath of the cops, but this time it'll be different. Change is coming to America, as the President says over the airwaves, but some changes are less welcome than others.\n\nThe bartender methodically cleans his cups half an hour before closing time: he'll take care of the mess in the toilets afterwards (and there is always a mess in the toilets). He got hired by the Don same as all the staff, but he's come to love the place. The patrons are gaudy and have a glint in their eyes, but it's a real life they're living here in the damp spaces.\n\nHe looks at a sleeping customer hunched over his cups and smiles wanly.

The few who realise what is about to happen begin pushing their way through the crowd, but the Morals Squad have already locked down the window exits and are marching through the doors, flashlights in hand, as they bust the biggest gay establishment in New York.\n\nThe raid doesn't meet with a receptive crowd, to say the least: As officers lead those in women's clothing to the toilets many resist. It's common knowledge that those who get arrested by the Morals Squad as cross-dressing men don't make it out without bruises, spit-drenched faces, manhandling. Men with faces lean and caked with makeup wrestle with their cuffs and spit on their captors. None of the bar's patrons have made it this far in a world which mostly despises them without getting a little rough around the edges, and when the Man pushes them around they push right back.\n\nBy the time the raid concludes about 150 people are under arrest.

Instead they keep the patrons on lockdown as the wagons arrive, far too slowly for a police operation. The patrons, of course, are understandably upset, and those few not under arrest quickly join the growing crowds gathered outside the building. Many of them know that once the Inn dies, so too does the living, breathing heart of gay culture in the Greatest City in the World. They have everything to lose.\n\nAs Mafia members and patrons are loaded onto the wagons, many still struggling, a lone voice breaks out. 'We Shall Overcome', a protest song written for the South African War, finds receptive ears in another angry crowd facing another unwinnable fight. Growing cheers, growling, shouts of "Gay Power!" echo from the crowds, which have swelled to bursting in the street. Stormé Delarverie falls to the floor struggling against four officers, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nRecords are unclear what exactly happens next: in a wave of anger, the mob pushes over police wagons, hurls bricks at the officers retreating into Stonewall, presses garbage against the broken windows. Many of the most repressed members of the gay community lead the riot - the drag queens and the street boys, leading a wild, wild charge. Sylvia Rivera, notable drag queen, will remember it as "the greatest night of her life". The doors of the Inn are broken open with a battering ram.

They form the rough outline of a cabaret chorus line and begin to sing. Their voices are piercing in the late night, and the police have had enough of being needled - they rush the line.\n\nMen and women get hammered with nightsticks as bedlam spreads to the surrounding streets. Crowds run around police officers, laughing gaily like warriors in the light of burning cars. By the time the riots come to a halt, Christopher Street is blocked, half the cars on it are overturned and every garbage can for a mile around has been emptied into the street. Witnesses describe an odd beauty to the refuse-strewn street, like a river of broken toys.\n\nOf course, the streets aren't the only thing breaking the news: all through the next day crowds gawk at the burnt-out shell of Stonewall, and when the next night comes the they are joined by songwriters, poets, activists and tourists washing down the streets in a tide of exuberant energy.

Though we could not stage direct attacks in the Home Islands nor in China, we have pinpointed various locations where we can start breaking down the Sphere from within. Let's begin with a nation that many of our great-grandfathers are familiar with.\n\nThe Philippines. These islands were the spoils of our victory over the Spanish Empire in 1898, and they stayed with us until the Second World War saw them forcefully ripped away from our influence. The Japanese preyed on the inhabitants ever since, spawning dozens of pro-democratic rebel groups that we could lend aid to. Their close proximity to the Japanese island may prove to be useful if we can get the Filipinos on our side.\n\nVietnam. The Vietnamese have been oppressed since the dawn of French colonialism, and the handing over of Vietnam to Japan only made matters worse for the natives. This could be our opportunity to introduce democracy and let Vietnam be ruled by Vietnamese for the first time in centuries. Vietnam could also be a gateway to India or even China itself if we succeed.\n\nIndonesia. These islands provide a large bulk of the Sphere's resources, mainly oil, rubber, and a hefty worker population. If we operate in Indonesia and persuade them to rebel against their Japanese overlords, the economy of the Sphere would suffer incredible damage. There would be shortages across East Asia, and it may cause other members of the Sphere to renounce their membership, further pressuring the Empire of Japan."

 USA_elec_prim.1_RD_Incumb:0 "The convention for the Republican-Democratic Party has reached its conclusion on live TV, with [USA.GetLeader] giving a rousing speech to the assembled delegates in Chicago's International Amphitheatre, calling for party unity, finishing what they have started, and going forth, to bring the United States closer than ever to the "shining city on the hill" that the Founding Fathers claimed America would be.\n\nIt wasn't exactly a cake walk for [USA.GetLeader], as they faced a spirited resistance from Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona, and John Glenn, Governor of Ohio. Both Goldwater and Glenn sought to replace the current President, either by going to the right and appeal to the Democratic wing of the party in the case of Goldwater, or further to the left and the Republicans for Glenn. However, neither managed to get many delegates in the few primaries that were held for the R-Ds, and just as soon as they announced their candidacies, they were forgotten and left on the sidelines.\n\nBut now the President can focus on their eventual opponent in the NPP, and [USA.GetLeader] is secretly hoping that they can win a second term just as easily as he pushed out "AuH20" and "Glenn Rogers" from the nomination."
 USA_elec_prim.1_NPP_Incumb:0 "It has all come down to this. A few days in the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois. The primaries are over, the delegates have been selected, and now it's time to see who will lead the Republican-Democrat Party into the 1968 election. There are now only two viable candidates in a race that has seen many trying to win the keys to the White House: Arizona Senator and proud firebrand conservative Barry Goldwater, or Ohio Governor and famed astronaut John Glenn.\n\nFor months, in debates on TV and radio, at rally's from coast to coast, and in living rooms and over the dinner tables of everyday Americans, the battle between Barry and John has raged. Pins with their faces, and slogans like "IN YOUR HEART YOU KNOW HE'S RIGHT" and "SOAR TO NEW HEIGHTS WITH GLENN", posters, newspaper ads, cardboard hats and all the memorabilia of a campaign seeking to win the chance to be the R-D standard bearer. Both are claiming that only they can end the anomaly that is the National Progressive Party's [USA.GetLeader] who now sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the first non Republican or Democrat to hold the highest office in the land since before the US Civil War over 100 years ago. But before they can focus on the NPP, they have to get the nod at the convention.\n\nBut as the night drags on and ballot after ballot shows little movement between Goldwater and Glenn, finally one of the few "favorite sons" left on the ballot, only there because some delegates hoped against hope that their chosen candidate could serve as a compromise candidate, finally folded. So with the last ballot, the result is clear..."

As the first White House occupant to be neither a Republican or a Democrat since Millard Filmore left in 1853, it was only natural that [USA.GetLeader] would get another crack at four more years in the highest office in America.\n\nThere were two primary challengers, Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine representing a new business oriented faction of the FR-NPP, and C-NPP leader Michael Harrington, both seeking to bring the party, and the nation, more in line with their prefered path. However, neither won more than a handful of delegates in the primaries, and both were overshadowed by the current President's popularity and leadership within the party.\n\nNow that [USA.GetLeader] has secured the nomination with little in the way of opposition, the plan now is to face the Republican-Democrats, and ensure that the past four years wasn't a fluke in American political history, but the start of a new two party system."

While there have been other candidates, some having won delegates in votes across the country, it has become clear that only Harrington and Smith stand any chance of winning the convention and the nomination.\n\nSlogans like "We Like Mike" and "MCS for POTUS!", along with chants for "M.C.S.!" and "Harr-ing-ton!" have filled rally's and meeting halls across America for months.

After four years in the White House, it's time for another Presidential election so the whole country can determine if the incumbent deserves another term, or if it's time for a change.\n\nThe Primaries for the R-Ds was short and sweet this year, as only one candidate emerged to challenge the President, South Dakota Senator George McGovern. However, like usual in American politics, it's next to impossible to beat an incumbent president in the convention, and McGovern's long-shot attempt quickly fell flat, turning the R-D Convention into a coronation for [USA.GetLeader].

Marshall, a graduate of Howard Law School and an experienced civil rights litigator, would be the first African-American to serve on the highest court in the land. His appointment would surely mark a turning point in American history. However, some in Congress are not so willing to see such a point turn in the first place.\n\nMany Senators come from the South, and are directly reliant on white voter blocs who aren't well-disposed towards putting a black man on the Supreme Court. Several members of the Senate have already put out statements to the press expressing their firm opposition, although nobody has come out and said that it would be due to Marshall's race. Instead, the releases mentioned the dangers of "liberal judicial activism", and other such phrases. Clearly, the appointment of Thurgood Marshall will be a political fight for the ages."

Justice Marshall will be the first African-American to serve on the court, and his confirmation is undoubtedly a victory for the Civil Rights Movement, which he himself has worked tirelessly to advance.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, a number of conservative senators railed against "judicial activism", and made a variety of statements that many commentators have called little better than dog whistles. Some even asked whether or not Marshall had ties to "American Bolsheviks". This strategy failed, however. At a press conference today, Justice Marshall stated his gratitude to the Senate, and to the people of America, before posing for pictures with his two sons and his wife, the civil rights activist Cecilia Suyat Marshall.\n\nThis is a truly historic moment for the nation, representing the triumph of justice over institutional racism!"

Two weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to have Marshall's nomination proceed to the Senate floor, but with the recommendation that it be rejected. This was seen by many as a death knell for the appointment, but still, our whips persisted in trying to gather the necessary votes. They failed. In a tight vote, the Senate rejected Marshall's nomination, led by a large bloc of reactionary southerners.\n\nAs observers sat stunned by the rejection of the man who would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, some in the White House were already drafting plans for a response. The next name on the shortlist is the fairly conservative Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Let's hope that he makes it."

Likewise, more Americans than ever hold reservations over bankrolling other nations' defense when issues at home - healthcare, infrastructure, inequality - better deserve the public's expense."

To the unspoken it pledged lips shouting their names in every alleyway and boulevard.

 POLITICS_RFK_DESC:0 "로버트 프랜시스 케네디는 분명 불우한 가정환경을 가지고 있진 않습니다. 재력가들과 정치인들로 그득한 케네디 가문의 일부인 그의 어린 시절에 배고픔이란 단어는 없었습니다. 메사추세츠 도심에서 아홉 명의 아이 중 한 명으로 태어난 그는 아일랜드와 가톨릭 혈통의 배경 아래 자라났습니다. 1925년 태어난 그는 유년 시절의 대부분을 대공황과 함께 보냈고 이때 그는 전에 본 적 없었던 빈곤함을 목격하게 되었습니다.\n\n뉴잉글랜드의 가톨릭 학교들에서 유년 시절을 보낸 케네디는 1943년 그의 형 조지프 케네디가 비극적으로 사망한 직후 해군에서 복무하기로 결심했습니다. 대서양과 특히 카리브 해 지역에서 근무한 케네디는 국가를 위해 봉사하는 것에 익숙해졌습니다. 역사가들은 그의 상대적으로 짧은 해군 근무 경력이 그의 삶과 정계 입문 결정에 대단히 큰 영향을 끼쳤다고 평가합니다.\n\n명예전역 이후 로버트 케네디는 언론대학원에 들어갔고 불우한 자들을 돕기 위해 설계된 복지와 사회적 프로그램들에 특히나 관심을 가졌습니다. 그는 미국과 일본의 평화협정이 진행된 그 장소에 있었고, 전후에는 전폭적인 복지 프로그램에 관해 집필하기 위해 스웨덴을 방문했습니다. 리처드 닉슨의 러닝메이트인 존 F. 케네디는 그의 형이었고, 로버트 케네디는 그에게 전폭적인 지지를 보냈습니다. 존이 그에게 큰 의지를 하게 되면서 그는 "내가 뭔가를 완성시키고 싶다면 내 동생에게 찾아간다"는 말을 남기기도 하였습니다.\n\n존 F. 케네디는 그 직후 암살당했습니다. 그가 참으로 좋아한 형의 죽음에 우울해진 로버츠 케네디는 민권법안의 거부권 행사 이후 그 우울함이 더욱 심해졌습니다. 당파정치에 환멸을 느낀 로버트 케네디는 국가진보당에 입당하기로 결정하면서 미국을 진정한 자유의 땅이자 모두를 위한 아메리칸 드림의 땅으로 만들기로 결심하였고 대통령 출마를 고심하였습니다. 1964년 그는 사회경제적 자유를 외치며 대선을 휩쓸었지만, 가장 중요한 점은 이상 없는 세계에서 몇몇만이 보여주었던 미국적 이상주의였습니다."
 POLITICS_LYNDON_B_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "보통 그의 이니셜인 LBJ로 칭해지는 린든 베인스 존슨은 여러 방면에서 아메리칸 드림이 실재한다는 살아있는 증거이기도 합니다. 그는 미국의 전형적인 엘리트가 자라났던 현란하고 화려한 환경과는 거리가 먼 텍사스의 농가에서 태어나 미천한 환경에서 자랐습니다.  존슨은 평범한 성장과정에서의 교훈을 잊지 않았습니다. 텍사스에서 불우한 아이들을 가르치며 수 년간을 보냈지만 그는 빠르게 정치적 본능을 알아챘습니다.\n\n그의 공격적 설득방식과 협상에 대한 재능은 워싱턴에서 "존슨식 대처법"이라고 널리 알려지게 되었고, 존슨은 이후 하원의원 보좌관에서 시작해 이내 연방하원의원과 공화당, 이후 공화민주당의 상원 원내대표로 재직하게 되었습니다. 이제 그는 어떤 미국인보다도 더욱 높은 자리에 올라가게 되었고, 미합중국 대통령에 취임하였습니다. LBJ는 수십년간 미국에 자라난 상처를 치유하겠다고 약속하였고, 인종과 경제적 불평등 문제를 단번에 그리고 영원히 해결하기로 결심하였습니다. 존슨은 모든 사람이 동등한 권리를 가지고 성공하기 위해 동등한 기회를 가지는 미국 사회를 꿈꿉니다. 하지만, 날마다 혼란 속으로 빠지는 독일과 계속 그 영향권을 유지하고 확장하려는 일본이 있는 한, 존슨은 그의 통제 밖의 사건들이 다시 한번 미국을 세계 전장으로 끌어내리려는 가운데 국내의 전선에만 집중하지 못하게 될 수도 있습니다."
 POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "리처드 밀하우스 닉슨은 복잡한 인물입니다. 원래 미국 하원의원이었으며 나중에 캘리포니아주 상원의원이 된 닉슨은 숙련된 정치공작을 통해 빠르게 의회 내 중요한 인물로 등극하였습니다. 상원의원 시절 닉슨은 조지프 매카시와 함께 회색분자로 정부 내 파시스트 의혹자들을 뿌리뽑기 위해 긴밀히 협력하였습니다. 또한 매카시만큼 주목을 받지는 않았지만 닉슨도 여전히 반파시스트적 감정을 가지고 있다는 것은 누구도 부인하지 않습니다.\n\n평생 공화당 의원이었던 닉슨은 민주당원과 함께 일하는 것이 썩 편하지 않았습니다. 하지만 국민진보당의 폭넓은 지지로 그는 재선에 나가야만 했고 1960년 대선에서 연합한 당으로 승리한 그는 대통령직이 생지옥이 되었습니다. 부통령인 존 F. 케네디가 자신의 사기적인 카리스마와 놀라운 역량으로 닉슨으로부터 스포트라이트를 빼앗아 가며 닉슨 행정부에 쐐기를 박았습니다.\n\n불안한 독일국과 일본과의 외교정책에 집중하고 싶었으나 민권 문제는 더 이상 무시할 수 없는 주제가 되었습니다. 자국 내에서는 인종 간 긴장이 고조되고 있으며, 사람들은 행동을 요구하고 있습니다. 닉슨은 인종 통합과 분리 어느 한 쪽에 지지하기를 꺼려했지만 이런 갈팡지팡 행보는 점점 어려워지고 있습니다.\n\n물론 닉슨은 국민진보당을 저지하기 위해 할 수 있는 모든 일을 다 할 수 있고, 그 중에서는... 초법적인 수단도 있습니다. 백악관 내를 포함한 사방에서 도전자들이 몰려오는 상황에서, 닉슨은 국가라는 배를 안정적으로 유지하기 위해 애쓰는 지옥같은 시간을 보낼 것입니다."
 POLITICS_JFK_DESC:0 "존 피츠제럴드 케네디가 정치적 명성을 얻기까지의 길은 다른 많은 사람들의 논란으로 가려져 왔었습니다. 강력한 케네디 가문의 자손이자 조지프 케네디 대통령의 아들인 그는 형 조지프 케네디의 죽음 이후 태평양 전선에서 불려져와 그 이후 계속 그의 아버지의 길을 밟도록 길러져 왔습니다. 1948년 대선과 민주당의 공중분해 이후, 존의 동생 로버트 케네디를 제외한 케네디 가문은 민주당의 잔여 세력과 함께 공화당으로 향하면서 공화민주당의 일원이 되었습니다. 몇몇은 존 F. 케네디의 경력이 그의 아버지의 실패로 더럽혀질 것이라고 예상하였으나, 존의 개인적 카리스마와 적응력은 그를 아버지의 그림자에서 벗어나오게 하였습니다. 1960년 케네디는 공화민주당의 부통령 경선에서 승리하였습니다. 불행히도, 그의 러닝메이트는 리처드 닉슨이었습니다.\n\n이제 존은 혼란에 빠진 국가의 선장이 되었습니다. 이 국가는 그의 지도를 간절히 기대하고 있습니다. 하지만 많은 미국인들이 그를 안정의 상징으로 보는 한편, 그를 장애물로 보는 사람들도 있습니다. 인종분리주의를 열렬히 찬성하는 자들은 그의 이상주의가 민권법안의 입법을 더욱 진행시키리라 여기고, 골수 진보주의자들은 그가 동생 로버트처럼 열정적이지 않다고 비난합니다. 운명은 존 F. 케네디가 국가를 선도하도록 명하였으나, 국가를 위험한 수역에서 벗어나게 할 사람이 정말 그일까요?"

USA_sen_bill_name_6:0 "The Federal Student Aid Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_6:0 "Education has been a local issue since the beginning of America, with local school districts maintaining schools and the states providing some direction. However, this has meant that there are wide disparities based on wealth and state mandates, meaning that many students are not receiving the full education they need for the future. The Federal Student Aid Act will fix this, by providing resources to states and districts that desperately need it, and a baseline standard of education across the US."
bill_6_passed:0 "President Robert Kennedy, surrounded by the students and teachers at Strong John Thomson Elementary School in Washington DC just a few blocks from the White House, is signing the Federal Student Aid Act to applause as news cameras and photographers record the event for posterity.\n\n"Today, we say that all of America's students deserve the chance to learn and grow, to become the well-informed, smart and intelligent adults of tomorrow that will make America better than ever. The doctors, teachers, artists, inventors and leaders of tomorrow are in our schools today, and we must do all we can today, to make tomorrow even better."\n\nThe FSA Act will set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government will provide money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the new standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile education groups and civil rights organizations are really pleased with the FSA in their equality and standardization edicts, many state's rights proponents are angry at the law, which is pretty much stripping the local control over education that has long been one of the most important roles of the states. While most of the articles of the law are only for those school districts that require the funds and are "opt-in," the need for money in many of the poorest states will force them to compromise on their beliefs in order to get the money they need to operate. Nevertheless, the FSA will soon make America one of the best educated nations in the world."

Overseeing the vote, Vice President Hubert Humphrey has announced that the act has failed to acquire enough votes, leading to a major blow to his and President Kennedy's effort at school reform.\n\n"The failure of this effort to reform America's schools will reverberate throughout the years," Bobby Kennedy angrily thundered during a press conference. "The next George Washington Carver will never get the chance to see their full potential. The next Ernest Hemmingway will be stuck in poverty. The next Thomas Edison will never get to change the world."\n\nThe FSA Act would have set up a new baseline standard for primary and secondary schools in America in Mathematics, English, History, Science, Civics and more. The federal government would have provided money to states and school boards that, due to financial reasons, are unable to raise their schools to the standards in hiring teachers and expanding classrooms, to promote equality of education across the nation. Other aspects of the now tabled law include funding for newer and safer school buses, penalties for school districts that fail to integrate their schools, and establishing a non-partisan committee to standardize textbooks across the nation.\n\nWhile state's rights supporters cheer the failure of the "draconian" and "tyrannical" efforts to level the playing field for education across America, Civil Rights groups and education unions decry the failure of the law and the many inequalities that will persist for the indefinite future."

After all, there is nothing more popular with a politician seeking re-election than to point to a new school in their district, or the improved test scores, to show that, yes, they are doing their job.\n\nBut, like usual, there are some concerns with the law as it has been written. For one thing, some Senators have expressed concern about how the federal mandates will strip the states of their prerogatives to manage education, which would be incredibly unpopular in some states, especially in the south and west. Other senators were a bit uneasy on the cost of the FSA, which will tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars to the budget. While, again, they like the idea of supporting education, they also don't want to saddle those same children with even more debt when they become taxpayers.\n\nHaving taken their words into account, Scoop has approached the committee writing the bill, and made his suggestion:"

USA_sen_bill_name_7:0 "The Affordable Housing Act"
USA_sen_bill_desc_7:0 "The American dream is centered around one thing: owning your own home. But since the end of the war, real-estate developers have been more focused on developing middle-class suburbia: thousands of cookie-cutter homes on twisting cul-de-sacs far from the centers of the big cities. This has left millions, especially racial minorities, squeezed out of the housing market. The Affordable Housing Act will solve this issue, and build many new homes and the amenities to make new communities."
bill_7_passed:0 "As the signing ceremony took place in the Oval Office to the flash of photographers' light bulbs, an assortment of real estate developers, civil rights leaders and mayors from cities big and small across America applauded as President Robert Kennedy signed the Affordable Housing Act into law.\n\n"I'm pleased to sign this bill into law, which will make it easier to build affordable, liveable, and safe housing for those Americans that could only dream before of home ownership," the President said moments before he signed the law. "Today, we say that every family in the United States has the right to own their own home."\n\nThe new law will allow cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them. The bill will also provide subsidies to develop common areas like parks and shopping centers, and help establish mass transit routes from these new developments to the inner city. These new homes would not be apartment blocks like some opponents had suggested, but duplexes, townhouses, row houses and other such buildings to allow more people access to housing that the larger, car focused suburban dwellings that are too expensive, or even forbidden, for racial minorities to access: government funding is only provided on the condition that no barriers will be put in place for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics or anyone else.\n\nAlready, there are many plans being drawn up for the "Kennedyburgs" in every city in the nation, redeveloping areas that had overlooked and abandoned for years, promising a new construction boom that will last for a decade or more."
bill_7_failed:0 "The votes are in, and the Senate has rejected the Affordable Housing Act, one of the key planks of President Robert Kennedy's agenda. Complaints about the cost, the dictates on how the money would be spent, and even lingering segregationist elements in Congress scuttled the law that would have revitalized major cities, opening up housing development for minorities and working class families, and created a whole new chorot of property owners.\n\n"The President is disappointed at the Senate's rejection of the Affordable Housing Act," a spokesman for the White House said in a press conference. "Nevertheless, the fight to expand home ownership and give all Americans, not just the wealthy and middle class, the chance to buy their own house will go on."\n\nThe defeated law would have allowed cities to rezone large swathes of areas into higher density residential areas to encourage the development of new construction in areas where the cost of housing has priced many out of the market, and provide low-interest loans to buyers to purchase them.

"I can tell that you are here to get that passed, right?"\n\n"Well, if you want to get to business," the Senate Leader of the C-NPP replied. "But you know it will help your communities greatly, make a lot of new homeowners, taxpayers, and all that shit that will make your cities and states happy indeed. And it won't be just Chicago or Seattle or Miami that gets the money. Every city and town in the country can apply for it."\n\n"It's going to cost a lot though," another senator said. "Not sure if my constituents will appreciate having to foot the bill."\n\n"It will pay for itself in time," Jackson replied, as he took a drink of water. "Besides, if you give a man a home, go and cut the ribbon when they open it up, I'm sure lots of folks will support you in your next term." Jackson set his glass on his tray, and stood up, preparing to hand off his dirty dishes and return to work. "You can't get better publicity than that.""

Regulations mandating that full-time workers be given an eight hour work day, or at least generous overtime pay is another large component of the NLRA. Penalties will be put in place to prevent companies from trying to get around this, including rules on who is classified as "part-time", a "contractor" or "freelance", and that all categories be given the same or equivalent benefits and rights as full-time employees. One of the most important aspects is the establishment of a federal minimum wage: $1.50 for full-time employees in most industries, with agriculture and a handful of service industries allowed to set a slightly smaller minimum wage to a minimum of $1.10. But this minimum wage would be re-evaluated every year based on inflation, to maintain the purchasing power.\n\n"The only way to maintain a strong economy and a strong democracy is to give everyone in the nation the ability to make a living," President Kennedy said as he signed the law. "To make enough to put food on their table and a roof over the head, to enjoy the fruits of their labor with leisure, and to maintain their dignity and freedom, never to be undermined by the greed and short-sightedness of their bosses."\n\nWhile opposition from business groups, conservatives, anti-unionists, and free market proponents has been intense, and Wall Street has seen a sharp drop in it's value when the bill passed, the NLRA has proven to be popular with the majority of the American workers and voters.

It's the individual state's job to determine what and how they teach, and we will get out of their way to do it."
bill_15_passed:0 "President Margaret Chase Smith today has signed the "Power to the States" Act into federal law, having passed through Congress last night after a midnight vote. The President addressed reporters in a press briefing after signing the law, stating that "...it is not the job of the federal government to mandate a one-size-fits-all approach to education in the fifty states of the nation. Each state, county and city knows what is best for them."\n\nThis law curtails the use of the federal budget to provide funds to schools to mandate certain requirements, such as required courses, class sizes, and the composition of those classes. This would effectively allow various states to re-enforce the old segregation laws, under the policy of "separate but equal" that had for so long dominated the education of all the states of the South.\n\nThe controversial law is a victory for Governor George Wallace and his segregationist and states-right faction of the National Progressive Party, who have long opposed the efforts by the federal government to desegregate schools and allow Blacks to study in White schools, along with other racial equality efforts by the federal government. However, opposition has been pronounced from civil rights activists as backsliding, and also from teachers unions and education leaders from around the nation, saying that the removal of federal subsidies to schools will create a wide gap as school districts and states in poorer areas will not be able to afford the cost to rival the schools in wealthier states. But the law has passed, and a new normal for teaching will soon come to America."

Winning an easy majority from both the National Progressive Party and the Republican-Democrats, it appears to have had a much broader base of support than was initially thought. Most happy at the news were the bill's main proponents: Senator Michael Harrington and Governor George Wallace, who came to a compromise on their differing views on welfare to create something that worked for both parties.\n\nAs soon as it is signed into law, millions of poor Americans -many of them from the poverty-stricken, rural South- will now be able to apply for government financial assistance. The bill's success has shown much of America that the National Progressive Party is truly capable of working together as a united political group on more than just foreign policy. It has also greatly strengthened the position of President Margaret Chase Smith, who stands to see a great uptick in her approval ratings."

Senator Michael Harrington, who was one of the bill's main supporters, called the result "unfortunate".\n\nThe bill was heavily anticipated as the first instance of true cooperation in the National Progressive Party over welfare programs. Vocally supported by Senator Michael Harrington of the C-NPP and Governor George Wallace of the FR-NPP, it found good ground in the House and quickly made its way to the Senate. Once there, however, it stalled, died, and left millions of poor Americans without hope for government aid.\n\nThe loss of the bill in the Senate has definitely weakened the position of the President Margaret Chase Smith, as well as humiliated the extremely vocal supporters of it found in Senator Harrington and Governor Wallace.

Unequal voting requirements were abolished; schools, businesses, and other public accommodations were officially desegregated. African Americans essentially gained the right to go to any school, work for any business, and attend any public facility they choose. As a whole, African Americans had political power that the race had never seen before, and this was only the first step towards full desegregation.\n\nBut not all was well in the South. Immediately, Southern voters flocked to Strom Thurmond's Far-Right NPP in hopes that the bill would be reversed, that society would return to normal.

RD_D_compromise_desc_101:0 "President Nixon spent a considerable amount of time pondering how to get the Southern Democrats to his side. The South always hated working with the North. If Nixon were to get through to the South, he would have to break this precedence by considering the one thing all Southerners hold dear: tradition.\n\nJoseph Clark Jr., a Pennsylvania senator, meets with Louisiana senator Allen J. Ellender. Both are Democrats, but the former advocates for civil rights while the latter is a hardcore segregationist, but a cooperative man. Clark is the first to speak. "I realize this new civil rights bill will have a far-reaching impact on the American South. But we're trying to work towards a plan that will free every American from discrimination."\n\nEllender had considered supporting the bill before but he knew that if it passed, the whole region would flare up. "Our states should choose their own direction with these so-called 'civil rights'-"\n\n"Your states have more important issues to address, Senator. This will be one legislation that provides opportunity for all Americans; it may boost your economy and make your region nicer to live in. After this, we will honor your state rights, but this must be an exception."\n\n"Do you not realize if this bill passes, our voters will turn to Thurmond's no-good Far-Right?"\n\n"I believe the storm will blow over eventually.

However, there is a small group discontent with America's involvement as a whole, but they are basically inconsequential."
USA_ICW_Discontent_2_desc:0 "With rising American involvement in the Indonesian Civil War, more public attention is being devoted to the conflict.

### Foreign tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Bombing_Airfields:0 "Our best planes are ready to take control of the skies over Sudwestafrika. We're going to bomb enemy airfields in the Sudwest to oblivion to ensure that our troops won't be harassed by any German planes.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Sudwest_Desert_Training:0 "The Namibian deserts are harsh, hot, and hostile for our troops stationed in South Africa. We must prepare them for the landscape so that we can force the Sudwest out of the war early.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Zentral_Liberville_NI:0 "Libreville is a valuable city within the Afrikan realm, providing essential supplies to enemy troops. We need to focus our energy into an attack on this city; if we take Libreville, we damage the Zentral, and we take important resources away from the Reich's grasp.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Ost_AgtOrng:0 "The rough terrain of Ostafrika renders a land invasion nearly impossible. Luckily, we have the Rainbow Pesticides on our side. The use of these substances would clear out all the impassable foliage and make an invasion of Ostafrika much easier for our soldiers.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_IP_Rock_and_Roll_Mother_Fucker:0 "The jungles of Ostafrika provide a natural citadel for the stationed German troops. If we are to defeat the enemy, we must train our guys in jungle warfare. We need to be able to move swiftly through the trees and hit the Germans where they least expect it.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_SAF_Buying_Out_Guns:0 "Our allies in South Africa are always in need of more guns, rifles, whatever we have. Seeing as they are our allies in this war, it is imperative that we keep their soldiers supplied. We don't want a supply issue to hinder us from winning this war, so let's ship more weapons their way.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_Buying_Up_Everything:0 "Not only do the South Africans need guns, but they also need artillery and support equipment. Shipping over some of these materials would give our ally a strategic advantage. We need all the help we can get from South Africa if we want to win this war.\n"
USA_Send_One_Advisor:0 "We may not be as involved in this war as South Africa and her enemies, but we can always increase the number of advisors we send over. Though it may cause some backlash, our logistics and battle plans would be improved, and we could invest more resources to ensure a victory over the Germans.\n"
USA_Send_Two_Advisors:0 "This war is becoming increasingly important every day that we are over here. We need to expand our logistics capabilities even more, we need to bring more troops to join the fight no matter how much hate we get back home.\n"


### Domestic Tooltips

USA_SAF_WAR_Cranking_Up_Draft_tt:0 "The number of soldiers we are currently fielding is not nearly enough to win us the war. In order to bring more soldiers into the fold, we have to institute a draft. Many citizens back at home will certainly condemn us for this decision, but we must accept this consequence if we want to continue the fight."
USA_SAF_WAR_Cancelled_The_Draft_tt:0 "Our folks in the States are livid in their response to the draft. Protests are being held everywhere in our country, and we are starting to regret this decision. We must find a way to reverse the draft, no matter the cost, if we want to regain support for our government.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_No_More_Excuses_tt:0 "Ever since this war began, the practice of draft dodging has been widespread. In general, our young men are finding ways to avoid the draft. From this point forward, there will be no exceptions regarding who can be drafted. The more men we send over, the quicker this war will be over.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_reverse_the_exemptions_tt:0 "Our recently-drafted men are now resorting to even more drastic measures to ensure they can go back home. They are really bringing the morale of our whole army down; we must send them back, even if we have to lose some potential soldiers. Maybe the public will forgive this mishap.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_domestic_prop_tt:0 "Ever since the South African War began, people were holding anti-government protests. We need to activate the propaganda machine and cool the discontent that strangles our country. If we can convince the public that we can win this war, we will have one less domestic issue to worry about.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_take_out_troops_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been fighting for a while now, and we believe that giving a few battalions a trip home could work to our advantage. We may get some good publicity if we can bring some soldiers back home with smiles. This action would have a marginal effect on our remaining troops, but it would certainly give a little boost to war support.\n"
USA_SAF_WAR_New_training_Shit_tt:0 "Our soldiers have been using up a lot of effort against the enemy. Not only does this produce a lack of ammo and supplies, but we also lose valued men when we put so much on the line. It's time to tone down the troops. We may lose some combat efficiency, but we will save human lives.\n"
USA_SAF_Talk_down_involvement_tt:0 "Support for this war is dwindling, and it's about time we put something in the papers. We have the option to reassure the public that we are not as involved in this war as the South Africans are. This will make our folks at home happy, but it could negatively impact South African troops and dampen their morale.\n"

They waited with goosebumped flesh for the loud voices from Heaven to proclaim the world becoming that of the kingdom of God and his Messiah, and the salvation of their immortal souls.\n\nIt was then that the infernal things came from the sky, and the horns were joined by guitar and drum and a voice like wailing, and the farmers cowered at what they now recognised as their destruction. The sky lit up like the pits of the abyss, and fire rained down upon them, and smoke filled the air, and ghastly filth poured over the land to wither all it touched.\n\nThrough it all the farmers shrieked and cried as their lives were ripped from their bodies. Some sought to comfort loved ones, others begged for the Lord's mercy. Young men ran in futility as their elders kneeled and awaited the brutal heat and sudden cold of death.\n\nIn but a few short minutes life was wiped from the bushveld, and not a one of them remained to see the American commander lean out of his helicopter to taste the air. He breathed deeply of the smoke and ash of his creation, and he knew it was good as he gazed upon the blasted landscape, devastation undreamt of by any ancient warmaster or khan. The commander looked to the vastness above and said a silent prayer to the same God the Boers begged to save them as they burned. He made a signal and the helicopters left back through the smoke, blasting their music as they left the cratered annihilation and its piles of black ash behind them, ash that had once been men who had hoped and dreamed and loved.\n\nLater, they would learn intel had been mistaken, and the village was not the rebel enclave they had thought it to be, but by then they had moved on to burn other villages in other lands, and it mattered little to them and was soon forgotten." #duplicate loc key

USA_debate.1.t:0 "Debate with Michael Harrington!"
USA_debate.1.desc:0 "Under the glare of the television cameras, President Wallace F. Bennett and Michael Harrington walk stiffly towards each other, offering each other thin smiles and a wooden handshake. The two are hardly friendly; Harrington has been a vocal critic of Bennett's international policy since day one of the administration, singling out Bennett's preferential trade policies with the OFN as a betrayal of American labor.\n\nAs the debate moves into the topic of foreign affairs, Harrington wastes no time going on the attack. "Mr. President, I'm often approached by people on the street - good, hardworking, honest Americans - asking whether they'll have a job next year. These are miners, steelworkers, farmers - the beating heart of American industry. How can you claim to be keeping America strong, when your administration subsidizes the purchase of foreign goods, leaving Americans grasping for pennies?"\n\nBennett smiles neutrally back at Harrington. "The beautiful thing about trade, Mr. Harrington, is that everyone benefits. You say that American industry is being weakened; I say that it's roaring to ever-greater heights, as tariffs come down across the OFN. You say that America is weakened by our purchases from our allies; would you prefer that we squeeze our allies dry, like the Nazis and their puppets? America can never stand alone in this world, and certainly not while facing the likes of the Germans and the Japanese."

USA_debate.2.desc:0 "President Wallace F. Bennett and Senator Margaret Chase Smith walked briskly towards each other, shaking hands briefly before turning to their podiums. In earlier times, the two had been cordial acquaintances in the Senate, united by love of country despite sitting on opposite sides of the aisle. But there would be no quarter today, with the Presidency up for grabs.\n\nSmith wasted no time shifting on the attack. "President Bennett, you speak of brotherhood between the peoples of the free world through freer trade within the OFN. Though the OFN must remain united against oppression, I question the wisdom of your approach; your policy confuses leadership with foolhardiness, charging ahead while turning a deaf ear to American workers and industry. The Treaty Ports should remind us all of the costs of ignoring American interests for naive hopes - of appeasement thirty years ago, or of fraternal brotherhood today."\n\n"Senator Smith, we distinguish ourselves from Japan and Germany by our promise that America stands for a free, prosperous world. The OFN is a community of peoples: it is not a vehicle for totalitarian domination, or colonial dependency. Free trade is the surest means by which freedom survives, binding peoples together in free and open exchange." President Bennett stared Smith down. "We must prosper together, or we shall perish alone."

USA_debate.3.desc:0 "President Johnson and Michael Harrington eyed each warily, looking for an angle of attack. There was surprisingly little traction to be had on issues of policy: pundits had noted that Johnson's Great Society and Harrington's answers for the Other America had a great deal in common. The debate would be decided on the question of trust, of suitability for the nation's highest office.\n\nPresident Johnson cleared his throat. "Mr. Harrington, while I must respect your compassion, I have my questions about the company you keep. The American people wonder how the NPP will govern in practice, instead of in theory, especially when you've got the likes of Gus Hall shouting about nationalization and class warfare. There is plenty to work on in America, but shouting Bukharinist nonsense isn't how you go about it."\n\nHarrington's face twisted in indignation. "Is that how low you'll go? Judging an entire party of your fellow Americans by the most radical among us? I will be unequivocally clear: Mr. Hall's views are at the extreme fringe of the party, I do not endorse them, and the party's leadership does not endorse them. We stand for an inclusive America, a caring America, an America where a man doesn't need to fear the boot of the blackshirt or the commissar, but instead trust in the charity of their fellow man. It is beneath you, Mr. President, to fall back on fear instead of civil virtue."

USA_debate.4.desc:0 "President Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator Margaret Chase Smith, once colleagues in the Republican party in the brief years before the formation of the R-Ds, wore stony smiles as they approached each other on the stage. The fallout of Smith's abandonment of the Republicans still rankled: for Johnson, Smith was a constant annoyance, while Smith resented Johnson for putting power over principles.\n\nSmith wasted no time going on the attack. "President Johnson, you speak highly of your Great Society, about alleviating poverty and want. But my constituents see an economy stuck in neutral, while the demands of the taxman grow year after year. You may have good intentions, President Johnson, but redistribution without prosperity is simply stagnation."\n\n"Senator Smith, you and I both know the result when business is allowed to pursue profits over people." President Johnson replied acidly. "I don't think anyone's eager to go back to a time when soup kitchens were the only relief for millions of Americans."

Kennedy hardly smiled as they approached each other, exchanging a wooden handshake before turning promptly towards their respective podiums. The compassionate gentleman of the C-NPP and the doctrinaire conservative of the R-D's had hardly seen eye-to-eye during their years in Washington, and they weren't about to start now.\n\n"President Kennedy, it is my patriotic duty to remind you that the Treasury is not a bottomless well for your bleeding heart!" Goldwater criticized harshly. "The American people have a right to know, and to question, the use of their hard-earned money and the growth of the national debt, and they are saying: 'An American is entitled to the sweat of his brow!'"\n\nKennedy threw Goldwater a disdainful glare. "Senator Goldwater, try walking up to the unemployed veteran, or the mother struggling with the burden of caring for their four children, and tell them that all they're entitled to is the sweat of their own brow. As if they deserve their poverty. These people don't need slogans; they need our help!"

Too perfect; the two seasoned politicians were too practiced to do something so crass as to let their disdain for each other show in public.\n\n"President Wallace has let far too many of America's sons die in foreign lands in pursuit of - what, exactly?" Goldwater questioned. "Fascists must be resisted, but your support for maximum force in South Africa, the carpet bombings and bombardments that raze whole cities to weed out a battalion! It borders on the bloodthirsty, throwing American lives away for political gain."\n\n"Senator Goldwater, am I the only here who remembers your... enthusiasm for tactical nuclear weapons? That with one bomb, you could do the work of an entire division and save their lives to boot?" Wallace bristled. "War is hell, and we can't pretend it isn't. You say that war can be made easy with a single bomb; I assume you, Senator, that you would put America on the road to Armageddon in the name of victory."

USA_debate.7.desc:0 "Governor John Glenn and President Robert F. Kennedy were all smiles before the cameras, shaking each others' hands warmly before turning to their podiums. The unlikely astronaut leader of the R-D's and the patrician-turned-prodigal son of the NPP faced each other on the stage, sharpening their verbal knives to draw blood from the slight differences in their dreams of a brighter future.\n\n"Governor Glenn, your reputation as America's first astronaut precedes you in politics." Kennedy smiled, but without a hint of warmth in his eyes. "But the American people today look for solutions for their problems here on Earth: poverty, discrimination, education. We seek a more perfect union here at home, rather than escape it in the stars."\n\nGlenn bristled at Kennedy's comments. "I assure you, President Kennedy, that our platform is far more than just a return to space. But if you insist on questioning the value of America's space program, I can point to every schoolchild who came up to me in the years following Gemini, asking if they too can bring America to the stars. To ask themselves, to dream, of the promise of America and its potential. And dreams motivate us far more than despair."

USA_debate.8.desc:0 "Governor John Glenn and President George Wallace walked slowly, almost reluctantly, towards each other, seeming to only touch palms briefly before turning to their podiums. Wallace's segregationism had viscerally angered nearly everybody in the North, a sentiment shared by Glenn. Wallace, for his part, barely hid a sneer at the latest Northern carpetbagger looking to tread on his beloved South.\n\nThe debate, predictably, centered on the question of civil rights, and Glenn did not hold back. "President Wallace, I can't understand why you insist on segregation in the 20th Century. By what right do you seek to deny good, honest Americans their rights?"\n\n"Governor, I'm not surprised by your utopian dreams, having gone to space and back," Wallace replied acidly. "Come back to Earth, Governor: we are a union of states, and my constituents demand that their rights be respected."\n\n"Whose rights? President Wallace, I'll make this simple: do you stand by what you said three years ago?" Glenn snapped.\n\nA second passed, an eternity onstage. Wallace's eyes widened for a brief instant, then narrowed, hardened. "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever? Yes, I do."

Kennedy's assassination and the chaos of President Thurmond, prayed for the triumph of reason and calm as Governor John Glenn and Michael Harrington took to the stage. To their great comfort, the two politicians were more than content to let their oratory take center stage - but words could cut as deep as any sword.\n\n"Mr. Harrington, we're both men who look at America as it ought to be, trusting that this country is - and must - march towards a brighter future." Glenn said. "I admire that, but can you say that your party shares your vision? With respect to the late Robert Kennedy, Americans have seen the NPP spend the past few months arguing endlessly with itself over his legacy, with the policies of the Thurmond administration buffeting your party like a toy boat in a storm. How can you convince the American people that your party shares your vision?"\n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington responded. "The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, is a travesty that must be addressed. The National Progressive Party has come behind me, to grapple with and put to rest the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives. We are called to minister to people on Earth, Governor, not abandon them for the stars.""

Glenn said. "I admire that, but does your party share your vision? Over the past few months, the American people bore witness to the very real fractures in your party, at war with itself over the impeachment of George Wallace. How can you claim that the NPP can lead American into the next decade, after four years of bitter division?"\n\n"The American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington responded. "I stand for those Americans who suffer, through no fault of their own, from racial discrimination, from poverty, and from hunger. The National Progressive Party has come behind me, to address the worsening problems Americans face in their everyday lives.

To their great comfort, the leading lights of conservatism and socialism in America were more comfortable settling their differences with oratory, rather than violence - but words could cut as deep as any sword.\n\n"Mr. Harrington, I will admit that I admire your humanity, your passion for the downtrodden and the disadvantaged." Goldwater stated emphatically. "But no man is an island, especially in politics. And I cannot help but wonder: how many stand with you in your own party? These past months have laid bare the agonizing disagreements within your party over the legacy of Bobby Kennedy. How can one lead when one's own house is in disarray?"\n\n"Senator, the American people will judge my leadership of the National Progressive Party." Harrington deftly countered. "Let me ask you a question, Senator Goldwater: how many must suffer for lack of food or shelter in your America of fiscal austerity and propriety? The deprivation faced by millions of Americans, who are penniless and homeless in the wealthiest country on Earth, can no longer be ignored.""

The bloodletting in the streets, the cries of the Little Rock school children before their death! America remembers, Mr. Harrington: how can you bring the nation together in the wake of all this?"\n\nHarrington glared daggers at Goldwater. "Senator, my long standing support for Civil Rights legislation is a matter of public record. Under my leadership, the National Progressive Party will not tolerate racism and discrimination, whether by skin color or the quality of their work. A far cry from your policies, Senator Goldwater: in your America of fiscal 'propriety' and 'austerity', how many more Americans must suffer for lack of food or shelter, and be told that they deserve their lot in life?""

Goldwater lauded his opponent, before shifting to the attack. "But after these past few months, watching your party agonize over the legacy of Bobby Kennedy - what does your conscience say to you now? You are a principled woman, Senator; can you convince the American people that your party is as well?" \n\n"Well, Senator Goldwater, I hope we've both grown older and wiser since our early days in Congress."

Johnson and Michael Harrington, who otherwise shared much in common on their prescription for the ills of American society, cut a sharp contrast from the moment they stepped on stage. A smiling Johnson towered over Michael Harrington as he vigorously manhandled Harrington's arm before the cameras. Harrington, to his credit, refused to budge or flinch, a quiet force radiating against Johnson's energetic presence. \n\nTheir roles reversed as the debate kicked off, with Harrington launching into a surprising criticism of Johnson's administration. "President Johnson, your Great Society suffers from a lack of ambition. The root causes of grinding poverty, of unemployment, of the debasement of human dignity remain unaddressed. We both agree on the role of government in fundamentally bettering American lives, yet you focus on treating symptoms while ignoring the cure that millions hope to receive." \n\n"Well, Mr. Harrington, you certainly don't lack for conviction." President Johnson replied. "But when you speak of dreams, I deliver results. Ask any American on the street: are they safer, healthier, more satisfied with their life? We both agree that politics is about people; but results matter as much, if not more than, ideas in politics. And I can promise you, if you believe that the Great Society isn't ambitious enough, you ain't seen nothing yet."

The focus of the debate would be domestic policy - an area that Harrington, ever the academic, had written about at length. But the devil was in the details, and Bennett was nothing if not a master of the details. \n\nBennett made a show of holding up Harrington's domestic policy platform - a veritable tome. "I admire your passion, Mr. Harrington. The crusade for the common man." He smiled. "But have you actually considered what it means to implement this? These programs, promising to bring the federal government into every facet of American life - you'd be talking about doubling, tripling the federal budget. Can you convince Americans why the federal government must bear all the burdens carried by our states and our communities?"  \n\nHarrington wasn't lacking for a response. "Mr. President, it's easy to say that things can't be done. But the reality is, beyond the walls of this auditorium, I have seen another America, one that suffers for want of food, dignity, and security. And this is before we factor in the struggles faced by our African-American communities! How can we claim to be the mightiest, the wealthiest nation on Earth, if we cannot feed our poor and shelter our homeless? The question is not whether we can or cannot; it isn't even a question.

"But it's easy to talk about nuclear annihilation, to casually threaten Armageddon as a solution for America's woes. America will not vote for a suicide pact with Japan under your watch." \n\n"I hardly think your party's one to lecture Americans about expansive military commitments, given your party's record on South Africa." Smith glared at Johnson. "In the defense of freedom, America must remember that the clearest enemy is the enemy closest to home - the enemy that still occupies American soil in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Hawaii.

"President Wallace, your 'right to work' programs are an abomination against hard and honest work. You would turn the act of labor into a thankless rat race, rather than the means of human dignity. Americans should work to live, and not live to work: It's callous, it's dehumanizing, and wholly un-American." \n\n"Well, Governor, we'll just have to agree to disagree on the value of work," Wallace drawled, an icy smile on his face. "But I'd have to argue that instead of talking about ideals, you should judge a man by their results. A growing economy, surging business, the spread of American products to foreign markets.

"Senator Goldwater, you say you respect states' rights, yet you insist on carrying the torch of civil rights, against the wishes of these states! The voters know where I stand; can you say the same?" \n\n"I'd say that your claim to monopolize the moral high ground on a question of civil liberties is hypocrisy of the highest order," Goldwater seethed.

Kennedy stated. "I think I speak for many when it is clear that liberty means different things in different states. That is an affront; the matter of civil rights cannot be done piecemeal and confined to individual localities; every man must be free, or nobody is free at all." \n\n"You paint me as a radical for wanting to respect the traditions of our democracy, while you demand obsequience and threaten submission for the slightest dissent. Is it not altogether more radical to refuse to accept that differences of opinion must at least be heard in your march to progress?" Goldwater shook his head.

Glenn opened. "But the elderly, the poor, the pensioners, the veterans who fought for America's freedom in the last war. Their disappointment is palpable, when I talk with them; that in President Kennedy's world, some suffering is more worthy than others of redress." \n\nPresident Kennedy leaned into his podium. "Nothing could be further from the truth! The history of America is the history of how African-Americans, and the worker, have labored for far too long without any avenue to address their deprivation.

The American people dream of moving confidently into the new decade, of reuniting with the Treaty Ports, not of smoke-filled rooms and committee minutiae. Nothing great was ever achieved by an abundance of caution." \n\nPresident Bennett's neutral expression hid his biting response. "Senator, if I have observed anything in my years in government, it is that the National Progressive Party has many dreams and many faces, to the point I have trouble hearing who speaks for the party as a whole.

Below is an excerpt of their heated exchange that night:\n\nMcNamara: "There will soon come a time when we are obliged to fulfill our duties as the Free World's custodian once again. Deluding ourselves from acknowledging the likelihood, or the necessity, of future interventions is counterproductive folly; in that regard, I am thankful that President Smith and I are in full agreement. But I believe we also have a duty to learn from prior interventions and the mistakes we've committed in them, that we can finish said duties expediently. Here, I fear, is where the Madam President is negligent."\n\nSmith: "I won't be so easily fooled by your sales pitch, Mr. Secretary. Despite the backhanded insult you've levied on our armed forces, the fact of the matter's that we have indeed learned from mistakes like South Africa. Our forces' stellar performance in Indonesia and the Middle East has validated Mr. Rumsfeld and his reforms to the American people. Hence we can now boast a military capable of responding to attacks against the Free World at any time - and, if I might add, save Arlington thousands of crosses while doing so.""

Japan was contained within the Pacific, Germany contained within Europe.

Containment has been a stellar success; why should we do away with something that clearly works?"\n\nMcGovern: "And look how your four years turned out for the world, Madam President. Our enemies still field war machines by the ten thousands. Our allies still yearn for support we can give them but somehow won't. We're no more farther from nuclear war today than we were in 1968; in fact, we may even have moved closer towards it, Hawaii notwithstanding.

Are you then, Mr. McGovern?"\n\nMcGovern: "Have we fallen so far from grace that we now criticize policy out of superstition, Mr. Jackson? My voice speaks the lament of families that have lost fathers, brothers, and sons to wars a thousand miles from home. I tire as they do of 'noble' crusades dreamt by old men with a nation of young men to live vicariously through.

Now, years after the simmering defeat of the last great war, the government finds itself facing these enemies once more, not within the wintry dread of political machinations and espionage; rather, it is time for the United States to prepare once more for the battlefield. Now is the time for the United States to rise, and lead the march for freedom, for liberty, for democracy!\n\nThanks to the preparations of our administrations and Presidents prior, the United States has come leagues ahead of preparedness compared to our worries of the past. However, we have a long path ahead of us if we intend to defeat the enemies of America. Nevertheless, we shan't suffer again, we shall defeat these bastards, once and for all!"
USA_ww3_mobilize_the_army_desc:0 "The United States, despite the sufferings of wars lost in history's turned pages, has grown to possess one of the most effective, most respected, and most powerful armies on the world's stage. Thousands of American men and women have proven themselves as heroes of the American people in the Army.\n\nHowever, although the power within the Army remains unquestioned, we must face the realities of some issues. The Army is a ferocious beast, but a beast that must be roused to action from slumber. However, the war-cries of Americans' enemies have rung out across the world; thus, it is time to spurn our own beast to action, and let loose the true hounds of war: the United States Army. The Army must begin immediate effective mobilization in order to respond to the growing encroachment of enemy forces, while bringing the reserves to the front lines. The United States Army must be prepared to take the offensive and be ready to strike!"
USA_ww3_scramble_the_airforce_desc:0 "The skies, holding the sun, the moon, and the stars, have become the newest addition to the ways in which humanity can wage warfare. From the skies above the Marne to the storms raging above Saint-Mihiel, the United States set a precedent for the quality sought in men seeking to bring the fury of the United States Armed Forces to the heavens above.\n\nHowever, the strength of our enemies have grown to match such fury, and bring about fiery destruction with their advancements in technology and tactics, with the potential of our enemies to spread death and terror if they penetrate our air defenses. Furthermore, the administration has come to realize that the Air Force being spread out across the country has handicapped its ability to move effectively to the new warzones being created everyday. We must set the Air Force to the highest alert, and have our aerial units ready to face the enemy within a moment's notice!"

If the Pentagon's estimates are accurate, the shipyards will need to be spun up to full capacity now to make sure the Navy keeps the war away from home."
USA_ww3_naval_invasion_crash_course_desc:0 "Although the protection of a navy shows in the guarding the open waters surrounding the United States on all sides, it can be safely assumed that the United States Navy can only act as a shield around our lands for so long. The Fascists have struck quickly and viciously before, and we cannot hope that staying on the defense will save us. No, we shall penetrate the barriers of the seas to strike against our enemies shores, to plunge the sword of the American military deep into the hearts of our enemies before we dare allow them to take the first step.\n\nUnfortunately, although the plans shall be ambitious, we must prepare for such aspirations lest we intend to see our military plunge to the bottom of the seas. Thus, the administration shall immediately order the instruction of naval invasion preparation and execution to our military command. Our command will take the first step, strike first, and cut the throat of the beast before it dares to claim the lives of any more good-hearted Americans!"
USA_ww3_impliment_war_bonds_desc:0 "America's participation in the first two World Wars stretched the financial resources of the country to the limit, and the realities of modern, mechanized warfare have come at a higher cost than we could have ever imagined. Income taxation will not nearly be enough to fill the yawning chasm of the discretionary budget, and our financial institutions and capital markets are beginning to balk at the successive regular bond issuances by the Treasury. We need to take our financing drive directly to the American people, mobilizing their savings for the war effort through retail war bonds."
USA_ww3_nationalize_air_industry_desc:0 "The United States has had a long term of industrial superiority, both as it continues to grow within history, as well as when it is spurned into a furious upkeep in supporting the nation, such as what happened during the Second World War. In those years past, the people of the United States acted as the blood within the Great Dragon that awoke, allowing the production necessary to modernize the war effort in the skies above.\n\nNow, however, we, as Americans, have found ourselves facing the damning strength of our enemies. Now, what we need is not only the talent and experience of the military, but the equipment necessary to secure our superiority, especially within the skies. Thus, the administration will work towards nationalizing several airline manufacturers to bring them to support the war effort within the United States. Sure, our critics may cite this as 'feeding the Military-Industrial Complex,' but we are at war, damnit!"

Gunnery Sergeant Hewitt commanded, exploding into the dark and formerly silent resting quarters of the young soldiers.

Get your utilities on and your asses in gear, be formed up outside the barracks at 0430, move it!" the Gunnery Sergeant exploded before leaving the room. The glass of stability which had continuously wavered in strength for Bannister was shattered as the Gunnery Sergeant left the room. Sure, he'd trained and all for the prospect of serving his country, but he never expected the day would come when everything went to hell like this. Bannister threw his uniform together as best he could and hurried out, along with the rest of his platoon.\n\nOutside, the frigid air of an early Kentucky morning was evident, but the rush of fear and terror was what truly crawled up the soldiers that morning. Standing at attention, Bannister stared forward as he saw his Gunnery Sergeant come into frame, yelling to his platoon, "The United States of America has, as all of you know, entered a state of war with the same men responsible for our defeat in the 1940's. Some of your fathers know that all too well, some of them may have even fought alongside myself back in England. All of that has come back, and we will not allow those bastards to harass the world any longer. Your platoon is being transferred to Fort Carson in Colorado, where you will all undergo extensive training to prepare for deployment out to fight those who think they can fuck with the goddamned United States.

A few days later, he looked out the window of the moving truck, thinking of how he was going to be toting a rifle on some battlefield, surrounded by blood and filth, instead of studying economics at Stanford like the plan was.. However, the journey didn't end there, as he sat while his hair was nearly shaved off by the Army barbers at Fort Carson. Finally, a Staff Sergeant came over to the new recruits, yelling, "Welcome to the United States Army, gentlemen. The United States has gone to war and we need your talent to serve the armed forces now more than ever." His voice droned on, but Isaac picked up as he heard the Staff Sergeant continue, "...Summers, Drake, Clarence, you eight are gonna be led by Corporal Bannister." as the soldier moved forward to the rightmost of the squad. Now, out in the middle of Colorado, was where the army's finest will find their way to the front lines.\n\nThe mud continued to gunk up Isaac's teeth as the barbed wire scraped against his ankles, as the recruit crawled and gunshots popped above him at the firing ranges nearby. All of a sudden, a hand popped in front of him beneath the barbed wire, and Corporal Bannister's face came out of the blur. "Come on, man, I've got you." The corporal said, as he helped pull Isaac forward. Isaac felt a genuine care and concern within the Corporal's voice as he got through it, feeling a connection to his squad leader."

USA.WW3.4.desc:0 "Private Summers looked off the bow of the USS General John Pope as his utilities contrasted heavily from the cold, open seas around him. Despite all of the harrowing difficulties, he had been hastily transformed from the next applicant to an Ivy League college to a true soldier of the United States Army. His feelings had devolved from resentment to a difficult mix of steadfastness and dread as the ship journeyed onwards. The Private's thoughts had almost drowned out the stomping of boots behind him as his squad leader, Corporal Bannister approached, rousing Summers to attention.\n\n"You're fine, Summers, take the time to enjoy yourself." Bannister said to the young Private, who looked troubled. "Thinking ahead?" the Corporal asked, thinking about the weeks they had spent travelling aboard the John Pope.. "Honestly, sir, no. Thinking about the past, more like, thinking of everything before all of this, before, well, the draft went out, uh, sir." He said while looking out into the waves crashing on the side of the boat. "Yeah, I get that, Summers. I didn't get that whole draft thing, I was down at the most comfortable base in Kentucky, thinking about how serving the country could help out paying for the wedding with my Jennifer. Think she's gonna be pissed with how long I'll be gone." The Corporal said, chuckling. Noticing his squadling's less than enthusiastic response, he asked, "Well, what about you, Summers? Where are you from?" The Private took a minute to respond, thinking of everything leading up to now. "Came out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, just graduated out of high school, finalizing my application to Stanford to study economics, was thinking of going federal with the job. Managed to get top of my class too, things were looking great. Sure, no girlfriend, like you, sir, and only a mom back at home, but it looks like the world had other plans."\n\nThe Corporal heard the Private's downtrodden voice, and offered a pat on the back. "Hey, I wasn't a Stanford kid, and economics aren't my forte, but what's to say we have to be sad about it. Things are rough, but the country needs us, good people like your mother needs us, now more than ever. If you wanted to help change the world, you've found your way there, Summers, because America needs people like you who can grit their teeth and keep going. Besides, fascism's gotta suck for the economy, huh?" the Corporal said, offering one last pat on the shoulder before walking away."

But ever since the war started, emptying out the city, the bank salesmen found themselves working more as impromptu therapists. The salesman, in the living room of his client, provided what counsel he could.\n\n"Hank, John's going to be alright. He was studying engineering, I'm sure he'll be doing research -"\n\nHank, a corporate lawyer by trade, was lost for words. "John called yesterday. Said he'd been assigned to the infantry, deploying overseas. I -" Hank hesitated. "I'm proud of him, Arthur. But..."\n\n"I'm sorry," Arthur replied. Everyone had a brother, a cousin, or an uncle called to serve, even as the nuclear drills made it uncertain whether anyone would survive at all. Material comforts, it turned out, did little to salve the existential terror of living through the Third World War.\n\n"It's alright, Arthur. Times are tough." Hank forced a laugh. "I just wish there was something I could do for my boy."\n\nArthur was silent for a moment, before reaching into his briefcase for the offering memorandum for the first retail issue of U.S. war bonds.

USA.early_flavor.1.desc:0 "Henry Jackson - known affectionately to his contemporaries as "Scoop" - sat at his desk, looking expectantly at the two figures sitting opposite. Maurine Neuberger, Scoop's deputy and fellow senator in the NPP's Center wing, quietly thumbed through her notes as she waited for him to speak. Next to her sat the nominal head of the Center's more radical wing, Michael Harrington, who waited with the same expectant look as Scoop himself. The two could not be more different, but as the Center's leader, Scoop knew he needed both if the party was going to get anywhere.\n\n"As you know, our election prospects are still looking dire," began Scoop. "The Right still holds plenty of influence over the party, and no progressive voter is going to vote for the party whose last candidate was Strom goddamn Thurmond. Worst of all, we still don't even have a candidate!"\n\n"Well it would help if anyone had bothered to put their name forward," joked Harrington, with a bare hint of contempt. "Perhaps if we were to do more to support our core working class voters in the Midwest and elsewhere rather than kowtowing to segregationists... and filling our ranks with West Coast elitist types-"\n\nNeuberger, herself of proud Oregon stock, sat up with an offended look. "Everyone here is fighting for the same thing! I've done plenty to speak up for the underprivileged - at least I don't just sit around writing essays about it!"\n\nScoop sat still for a moment, smiling bemusedly as his colleagues continued to bicker and snipe at one another. In a way, they were a perfect reflection of the Center as a whole - determined to enact change, but endlessly at its own throat about what that change should be. Finally, he coughed, and the other two immediately ceased their childish exchange and looked to him once more. "You are both very different, which is exactly why we need somebody who can speak everyone's language. If we're to have any hope in this election, we need to move forwards with one voice."\n\nHarrington and Neuberger looked at each other unsure of what to say. Scoop glanced out the window with an uncertain look. "I don't know who the man to lead us is. But he better show up soon. Or we are screwed.""

Vice President John Fitzgerald Kennedy sat thoughtfully chewing on a turkey sandwich. Opposite him sat a smiling man who the party registry knew as his chief of staff, but who John had always known as his brother.\n\n"It's been too long since we've taken time to ourselves," said John with a smile. "How are you, Bobby? Ethel still taking good care of you I hope?"\n\nRobert Francis Kennedy laughed at the playful wink his brother gave him. "I can hardly complain on the home life, Jack." His grin faded. "Still, current events haven't exactly been great for my sleep."\n\nThe older Kennedy nodded sympathetically. "The violence is getting worse, for sure." He frowned. "Nixon being a stick in the mud about it isn't helping things either. He still won't endorse any legislation on the matter."\n\n"Can't you do something about it? As long as the President sits on the fence, things will only get worse."\n\n"I'd love to, but you know how Nixon is," muttered John, idly stirring his coffee. "Knowing him he'd probably just veto whatever we put in front of him and yell at us for 'fracturing party unity'.\n\n"But this is far more important than party unity Jack! There are millions of Americans - millions of good, honest people - being cast aside for things that are far beyond their control. The longer we wait, the greater their suffering will be." Fixing his brother with an intense but encouraging look, he continued. "You're the Vice President. At the very least you can use your voice in the name of those who have no voice."\n\nJohn was silent for a moment. Then he smiled. "You've always been a good man, Bobby. You are right, of course, I must act.""

The circumstances aren't ideal, but I can think of no better man to be President right now." Robert could barely contain his adoring smile. "Think of all the things we can finally accomplish!"\n\n"Come on, Bobby, you're embarrassing me," chuckled John, who beamed nonetheless. "But thank you. I know I can always count on you."\n\n"Always. Like I'd leave you for the NPP or anyone else, especially when you're about to give this country the change it so desperately deserves!"\n\nRobert's enthusiasm, seemingly infectious, prompted more laughs from his brother. "Now, now, we have a lot of work to get through before we can set things in motion." His look became more serious, more determined. "The party's image is somewhat tarnished at the moment with the Nixon fiasco, so I've arranged some trips across the country to shore up support." At this, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a long itinerary of events and dates in various states and cities and handed it to Robert.\n\n"Of course. We do have the election to worry about." Robert frowned, before reverting to a smile. "Come on Jack, I suppose we can just enjoy this meal before your big tour, you've earned it."\n\nAnd so the brothers sat for a while longer, enjoying their food in peace. As the time finally came for them to leave, Robert quickly glanced at the list and noted his brother's first destination. He smiled at his brother one last time before they departed.\n\n"I know you'll do great Jack. I'll see you when you get back from Dallas.""

USA.early_flavor.4.desc:0 "Despite his best efforts, Robert F. Kennedy could not hold back his tears.\n\nHe was supposed to give a big speech about his brother's legacy, about the strength and dedication of his character and how he was an example to all within the halls of power. That was true enough, but as he sat in the holding area awaiting his cue, he could only think of John as the brother he had looked up to. His greatest inspiration and his closest friend. He wondered if he should just call it off, so great was his grief. Grief, and anger.\n\nJohn was killed because he was the president. He was only the president because of the Republican-Democrats. Because of Nixon lying like a bitch and doing everything in his power to stop progress and change, killing the Civil Rights Act and forcing John to step up to the firing line in the most damnably literal way. The party had chewed him up and spat him out. They had used him, just like they had used the entire Kennedy family and dragged their name through the mud.\n\nWhen a staffer poked their head into the room to wave him on stage, Robert stilled his tears, and prepared to give what would become one of the most shocking speeches of his career. After slowly ascending to the podium, he addressed the assembled crowd, giving a short but passionate eulogy in honor of his brother, extolling his candor, his way with words, and his dedication to America. The crowd nodded along, some cried, some bowed their heads. But none of them could prepare for what came next.\n\n"My brother was loyal to the Republican-Democrats through and through. He was loyal as they made every effort to avoid bringing this country true equality and justice. He was loyal as they charged blindly into an unnecessary and bloody war in Africa. He was loyal as he was ignored until the time where they needed a man to clean up their mistakes, and he was loyal as the fallout of their ignorance resulted in the loss of his life." He paused as many in the crowd stared agape. At least two from the party mouthed words of astonishment and curses at him. His next line would live on in infamy.\n\n"I was loyal to the Republican-Democrats also. That ends today"."

He wondered if what he was doing was too much, or if anyone would take him seriously given that he had been an establishment stooge for far too long. Still, he had to try.\n\nFinally, the door to the office swung open. In walked Scoop Jackson, closely followed by his underlings Neuberger and Harrington. The three regarded Kennedy curiously yet hopefully as they sat opposite him, each shaking his hand in turn. Scoop was the first to speak. "This is certainly unusual. But I hear good things about you, Mr Kennedy. We have a few questions for you before we go any further."\n\nOver the next twenty minutes, the impromptu Center committee picked Robert's brains over a wide variety of issues. "How committed are you to the Civil Rights Act?" asked Scoop. "You agree that the state of healthcare in this country is disgraceful?" asked Harrington. "Don't you think this country should do more to protect the environment?" asked Neuberger. It felt almost like a college debate club, but Robert answered all their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically.\n\nAs their questioning came to a close, Robert spoke up. "The Republican-Democrats no longer represent this country, nor are they willing to do what is necessary for its people. I want to join you because I feel that you represent the change that I believe in... and the change that my brother believed in."\n\nScoop glanced sideways to his associates. Neuberger nodded with a smile. Harrington paused, then gave a small nod in assent.

It occurred to him that if every human being had the opportunity to see what he could see - how insignificant all the struggles and wars and vendettas were - the world might finally know peace. A peace where everyone could work towards the advancement of science, prosperity and-\n\nA sudden ringing cut across his psyche, and he was jolted from a dream of days past. Sitting sluggishly awake from his sadly earthbound bed, he fumbled for the telephone on his bedside cabinet and pulled the receiver to his ear. "John Glenn, speaking - way too early in the morning might I add."\n\nA panicked voice came across the line. "John, it's James. Have you heard the news?"\n\nGlenn rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and replied "James Edwin Webb, I have not even got out of bed yet. Be more specific-"\n\n"They're defunding NASA!"\n\nA hastily-made coffee and frantic flip through the morning paper later, and John Glenn felt a wrench in his gut as he faced the prospect of his life's work being all for naught. "So what, the Germans got to the moon first and that just means space is over? What can we do? They can't just give up on the future!"\n\n"Nixon's already made his mind up. He wants to move the money over to the military and other 'practical projects'". Webb paused as Glenn made an outraged intake of breath. "I really don't think there's anything that can stop him at this point. I'm sorry, John."\n\nGlenn felt himself back in the rivierre of space flight. The government could not let the dream of space be but a dream. America had to live to see the stars. "Nothing we can do? We'll see about that.""

Now, he needed to make a big splash.\n\n"I had just been having a pleasant dream about my last mission, when my good friend James Webb woke me with the news. I was distraught, to say the least, to know that the government was giving up on the future of space travel. Partly because the thought of never going up there myself again is saddening to consider, but that's not the only reason.\n\n"By ending our involvement in space, President Nixon has given up. He has accepted stagnation and decline, abandoning the stars to the fascist powers. He says we 'lost' the space race, but as long as the stars still shine space will never be lost. I implore that the President reconsider his options. The future of America, and the human species as a whole, lies above us."\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, Glenn made his closing remarks, and was greeted with raucous applause. He felt satisfied that his words had hit their mark, and with so many journalists in attendance tomorrow's papers would carry them further still. Yet he still felt defeated. His words alone would not be enough to save NASA.\n\nIf American space travel was to have a future, it would need a voice to represent it in the halls of power. John Glenn had never been one for politics, but as he thought on it, he realised that political office may be his best course of seeing his dream fulfilled. As he drove home, he recalled that Ohio's governorship was up for election in a few months. It was an almost crazy thought, and yet..."

The American currency is over reliant on the silver standard. What I am proposing is really not that radical - all the Silver Act suggests is that we reduce that reliance both within the federal budget and in the private sector." This was perhaps the third time he had explained this simple concept to the assembled senators, and many were listening intently, but Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen to enact his characteristic bullish persona to derail the discussion.\n\n"And I also say it's pretty simple - that you are wasting time arguing over which metal we base our currency on. Last I checked, America was still an economic giant by all accounts, so I really fail to see the merit of this passion project of yours." Johnson scoffed as he leaned informally against his desk, and Bennett felt his blood pressure steadily rise at the lack of respect.\n\n"We can be so much stronger though, Mr Johnson. Myself and my colleagues have done much research into the matter. We haven't even begun to get into the hard data - allow me to show you the charts-"\n\n"I will gladly look at your graphs, Mr Bennett, but given the times we live in, I still say that silver is a rather small thing to get worked up over." Johnson chuckled idly as Bennett launched into more discussion, clearly not listening.\n\nBelittling as always, thought Bennett. Johnson was supposed to be his ally. The Republicans and the Democrats were supposed to be allies. Yet even the Center and Right NPP seemed to have a better and more equal relationship than the two sides of his party did these days. As a Democrat, Bennett felt increasingly sidelined. That would have to change, he decided then and there.\n\nAfter the ultimately fruitless discussion came to a close, the two men passed each other as the senators left the hall for lunch.

USA_IR.1.t:0 "이란 내전"
USA_IR.1.d:0 "In recent years, we have seen Persia become a wide breeding ground for oppression and ruthless authoritarianism during the rule of Pahlavi. Pressures from Berlin and Tokyo have caused a cave-in for the fragile political structure of the once-proud nation. However, the people have started to speak out against tyranny, and our shining opportunity is developing itself right before our eyes. The National Front, formerly outlawed under the Shah's one-party dynasty, has made a resurgence in the local population, and every class seems to show its support: farmers, soldiers, and noblemen alike. In a surprising referendum directed at the parliament, the people demanded free elections, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, among others. The result? Over two hundred "freedom fighters" dead, over a thousand wounded. Angered at this sight, democratic politicians continued to speak out against the Shah, all while building up a competent army in the southern half of the country along the Zagros Mountains and the Persian coast. A constitution was signed and the new Republic of Iran seceded only a few hours ago.\n\nPersia is the gate through which the Caucasus, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East can be accessed. We also don't want the barbaric German eagle spreading his talons over the oil reserves in Iran. With a friendly government, any chance the Germans have at filling up their Panzers with Persian oil is slim. If the Liberals win this conflict, they could be our "experiment" with democracy in the region, a beacon of hope for the peoples of the Middle East. We must be hasty; the frail democracy is already on the defensive."

USA_IR.2.t:0 "The Iranian Aid Bill"
USA_IR.2.d:0 "Just this morning, Congress passed the Iranian Aid Bill with an acceptable majority, giving us the power to send volunteers and military advisers to the National Front forces. Until our equipment can reach the Persian coast, we have invested $100 million to keep the Liberals fighting. Furthermore, this bill ensures our lasting cooperation with the Republic of Iran, and we are now committed to keeping the candle lit for as long as possible.\n\nAlready, as the money flows into the newly established nation, the locals have been praising us for our swift efforts. We have also been getting positive reports from the population here, and it seems people are more eager to combat oppression in Iran than in any other war in the past decade. We cannot fail the public now."

USA_IR.3.t:0 "Grand Strategy of the Iran War"
USA_IR.3.d:0 "Our generals are currently divided over our potential policy for the war ahead. Two options were given: we either send our own men into combat to directly influence the course of the war, or we supply the National Front from a distance and let the Iranians be the ones fighting.\n\nThe advisers supporting direct involvement argue that offensives will be carried out quicker and that results will be seen much faster. Our troops are much more trained and ready than the Liberal troops. Americans may die on the battlefield but the overall number of casualties will be lower than if we only sent weapons. Officers supporting indirect involvement claim that if the U.S. Army lands on Persian soil, it could bring Germany or Japan into the conflict, and that is certainly not in our best interests. The public isn't showing support for this kind of intervention either, and it would take a resounding victory to even dent their disapproval.\n\nThe advisers supporting indirect involvement claim that, first and foremost, less Americans will be sacrificed for freedom.

However, if this advance fails, there will be a monumental loss of American life, and the war might as well be lost. It is a big risk, but if our troops can pull it off, the war will be won handily and we have our Middle Eastern ally.\n\nAlternatively, we can expect the long-term war from the start and try to wear down our foe over time. The war may be longer, but we would have no risk of failing and embarrassing ourselves on the world stage again. At the same time, there would be no chance of a swift victory. This route allows for a greater conservation of resources and all our soldiers would have to do is hold out longer. The idea may not sit well with the average soldier, but it is meant to keep him safe.\n\nIn conclusion, our military either risks the entire operation on one single offensive, or we hold everything in the trenches and wait for the enemy to attack us.

 USA.culture.1.desc:0 "A spokesman for the Kennedy family reports today that former president Joseph P. Kennedy passed away in his Massachusetts home at 81. He is survived by his wife and six children.\n\nThe elder Kennedy leaves behind a complicated legacy. His success as patriarch of the Kennedy dynasty was substantial, as his sons John, Robert, and Edward all made names for themselves in the political sphere. The elder Kennedy was elected president in 1932 and presided over the slow recovery of the United States from the Great Depression. Despite serious criticisms for his non-interventionist policy, both in economic and foreign policy, he won a second term in 1936.\n\nThis second term was mainly defined by Kennedy's continued reluctance to intervene in the European war, and failure to fully prepare the United States for global power projection against Japan or Germany. Kennedy was the source of much criticism in the aftermath of his presidency, which only increased after the failed intervention in England and the signing of the Akagi Accords by his successor, Harry Truman. The Democrats would not hold the White House for another two decades, when his son, John F. Kennedy, succeeded the disgraced President Richard Nixon.\n\nKennedy had spent the years after the presidency retired from public life, having lost his son Joe Jr. in a bombing raid over the Pacific, but he reemerged to help with his son's bid for the vice presidency. However, the elder Kennedy kept himself out of the public eye, due to widespread criticism of comments he made advocating detente with Germany to focus on confronting Japan, and refused to help with his son Robert's presidential run in 1964.\n\nRegardless of how the American people remember him, Kennedy left a lasting mark on the nation's history, and his family will most likely continue to have a major role in politics for the foreseeable future."

He was born to a poor farming couple in central Kansas and learned to drive a tractor when he was only seven years old. His skill with a rifle came when he crossed the border into Arkansas and began hunting wild hogs to feed his mother and father. When he turned eighteen he was faced with a dilemma: either join the Army and provide parents a substantial income, or stay on the farm for eternity. Once the recruiters arrived at the farm, Jonathan's parents would not see their son again for another six years.\n\nTraining came and went, and before he knew it, Jonathan's division was sent off to Port Elizabeth. The Jayhawk Division, organized in Kansas, was well-prepared for the lowly plains of South Africa, but mastering the terrain was only one step in the process of combat. Stafford himself was involved in several offensives against the Germans and pulled together several kills, but his involvement ended when he was shot in the shoulder. While he was being taken to cover, an advancing German shot another two bullets into his wrist and hand. The wounds were not fatal and Stafford fully recovered, but, much to his chagrin, he was sent back home.\n\nNow, Stafford was a very proud American, and he hoped the general public would hail him as a hero who fought for his country. To put it bluntly, he received the exact opposite: protesters spat on him, threw dirt in his face, and even tried to frame him for murder. Students from Kansas State found his address and attempted to set his parents' farm ablaze, but police arrested them before they could act. The public response to Stafford's actions was possibly even more scarring than his experience in the war."

However, not one story had gained as much attention as Hal Moore's We Were Young Soldiers. A New York Times bestseller in its first three weeks of publication, the novel chronicles Colonel Hal Moore's adventures as a commander in 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry.\n\n"The savanna was harsh, hot, and desperately in need of action. Laying in the bushes for hours on end was grueling, but if you were tired of being on the ground, the Germans were not afraid to shoot. Sometimes they'd shoot anyway. I couldn't imagine how frightened my men must have been."\n\nOne thrilling part of the novel focuses on Moore's successful gamble to ambush an important German position, and how it resulted in twenty German deaths and a hundred captured POWs. The superb commentary of the event was likened to that of Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage, and reviewers have considered it one of the greatest military novels of all-time.

However, as the film goes on, it becomes clear that EPAC has decided to kill the crew.\n\nIn a tense struggle, made all the more nerve-wracking by Kubrick's long takes and understated sound design, Bogenmann is able to deactivate EPAC, who mournfully sings "Stille Nacht" as his circuits are disconnected.

To American audiences, the thought that someone could just order a nuclear attack on a whim was something that could only happen from Germania or Tokyo, not in the good ol' USA. The flailing efforts to recall the bombers, and the German revelation of a Doomsday Device that would kill all life on earth as the bombers head for Japan just further confounds the audience's expectations. The movie showed that everyone, from the unnamed yet all powerful and raving Nazi Fuhrer and the over-ceremonial puppet Japanese Emperor were just as incompotent as any corrupt politican elected in the US, espeically in the face of nuclear armageddon...\n\n...Yet, "Dr. Strangelove" is much more than a surreal look at mid-20th Century fears of nuclear war. It will be recognized by future generations as a classic of filmmaking. Kubrick's obsessive attention to detail in everything from the camera work to the exact facial expressions of the actors on screen. The brilliant acting of Peter Sellers in three separate roles: as a British emigre RCAF officer who tries to restrain the American general, the unready and soft-spoken President of the US thrust into a diplomatic crisis, and the creepy and comedic Dr. Strangelove, a Russian scientist who has some crazy ideas of how to rebuild the US in the aftermath of the now inevitable nuclear war involving cross-breeding people with plants.

Scott as he reveals just how the world was to end with American B-52's flying low over the Kanto Plains, with his arms stretched out and making sound effects with his mouth. The cowboy riding the bomb down like a bull at a Texas rodeo to obliterate a Japanese military base, and finally the montage of nuclear bombs exploding to the haunting "Maybe" by The Ink Spots...\n\n...it is, perhaps, the perfect dark comedy: funny in the face of terror, horrifying despite the levity. It brings in stark contrast the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction to an audience that just didn't quite comprehend the fact that a nuclear war will be the last war.

Where a decade ago horsepower and size were prized qualities for the American car owner, now they are seen akin to the white elephants of Thailand: Delights to view from afar, but pains to afford and maintain. With the Oil War and hardships it brought, America's tastes have finally shifted in full towards fuel economy and cost.\n\nThe now-venerable Mustang would have suffered the same fate as its fellow burdensome beasts were it not for the haste of its parent company's engineers. Plans were made in Dearborn to accommodate the gasoline rations and reigning economic slump to their car's design: Lengths and widths were cut short, gas-guzzling V8s replaced with compact I4s, and frames modified to reduce noise and vibration as its dimensions shrink. Drawing from their failures with the Pinto, Ford set out to effectively downsize their flagship muscle car into a form suiting the American family's increasingly tight purses.\n\nThe end result is the second-generation Mustangs, or the Mustang IIs, released with aplomb today. Seemingly satisfied with this compromise between economy and style, men with means have gone out to purchase Ford's new-old car in droves. Analysts estimate that Mustang II orders will reach more than 400,000 by New Year's, hopefully foretelling that Ford's greatest success will continue succeeding for another decade yet."

 USA.culture.19.desc:0 "The previous two decades have been rough on the United States of America: being on the losing end of the Second World War, giving up key ports in California to the enemy, watching Europe and Russia fall to the jackboot, utterly powerless. Worst of all, our own red-blooded Americans were struck by the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen: twenty years ago today, Pearl Harbor was destroyed, wiped from the face of Earth by the atomic bomb. December 7th, 1941 was another devastating day, as two thousand lives were lost upon America's entry into the war. The base was the place of death for tens of thousands of brave men and women who gave their lives for freedom's cause.\n\nThe construction of the Pearl Harbor Monument in Washington, D.C. lasted three years, and opening day has finally arrived. Thousands flocked to the capital to view statues of soldiers raising the American flag, replicas of American battleships, and the centerpiece of the monument: a large "peace fountain" that contained the names of every soldier known to have died in the Pearl Harbor attacks. Gardens were also planted in honor of the fallen soldiers, and it quickly became the site of mourning throughout the area.\n\nFlowers were left at the base of the fountain, coins littered the fountain floor. For the Americans who had no flowers to give nor coins to donate, they gave the utmost respect for the fallen soldiers who perished in the face of destruction. Even a handful of exceptionally patriotic Americans claimed that "America would have her vengeance". No matter one's beliefs, tonight is a night of remembrance."

As Torontonians rub their chins in anxiety, their hometown Maple Leafs, the defending Stanley Cup champions, duke it out with the Detroit Red Wings. Men slide across the ice, making epic leaps and clever backhands, dueling with their sticks in a display of speed that brings to mind a shell game. One moment, they swarm around each other, desperately trying to assess the other team's next move. The next, it's an epic dash across the arena. Detroit is resentful. They've only won one game out of five in this final, and the fans, in their hearts, know that tonight could be the end of the line. Two nights ago, they had pelted the Leafs with paper cups and programs after the game. The air tastes bitter.\n\nIn the second period, Maple Leaf centre Dave Keon manages to swing across the blue line and around Alex Delvecchio, giving Toronto its first goal of the night. Not long after, though, Marcel Pronovost scores for Detroit. But with seven minutes to go, Toronto winger Eddie Shack, a foul-mouthed born entertainer with a penchant for sparking brawls on the ice, manages to break the tie with a deflection shot, giving the Maple Leafs their second straight Stanley Cup.\n\nWith a graceful "swish" across the ice and into the net, the crowd leaps from their seats. The Maple Leafs have won. Toronto has won. Canada has won."

Much like the frontier, Adriatica is rife with outlaws and constabularies, saloons of sin and banks of marble, and poor settlers caught in the middle as they toil a miserable living out of sands streaked with blood and oil. Never in the present has there been a depiction of this mythical age truer than Italy's youngest province.\n\nItalian filmmaker Sergio Leone demonstrated his awareness of such when he released For a Few Dollars More late this year. Featuring up-and-coming Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood as a rough, tough-speaking mercenary, the movie brought new life to an old genre while introducing its own refreshing themes. Standoffs between lawmen and bandits in desolate mining towns were joined with the ambitions of laconic bounty hunters and long-held grudges, tied together in a captivating plot centered around a heist. Though the film depicted America's Old West, the conflicts it had shown resonated with the Italian pioneers seeking their fortunes in their country's new frontier.\n\nDespite less than stellar reception from film critics for its over-the-top violence and "campy" tone, the film nevertheless broke records by reaching $4 million in ticket sales in Italy by year's end. North America added an extra $14 million to the film's gross revenue, proving that there is a place for the now-termed "Spaghetti Western" in the Free World's silver screens. Already rumors abound of a sequel, and directors and studios hint of filming their own reimaginations of a bygone era in the very same savannahs that evinced its stories in the hearts and minds of millions."

Critics from the Chicago Sun-Times have regarded the movie as being "a brilliant showcasing of the depth of investigative journalism, as paranoia, self-doubt, and harassment dominate the cases of the heroes of the Washington Post." The movie soared to reach a cemented number one spot at the box office as Americans rushed to see the political thriller.\n\nDirector Alan J. Pakula provides the American audience a journey across the spheres of journalism, writing, and politics as the film looks into the journeys of renowned reporting duo Katharine Graham and David Halberstam as they take on the haunting shadows which peer over their every move. Together, the duo follows one step after another in the journey to unveil a secretive and dangerous conspiracy involving the White House administration, scaling all the way up to former President Richard Nixon himself, who, just two years ago, resigned from his office as President of the United States. Graham and Halberstam served as writing leads behind the movie itself, with Graham stating that "David and I wanted to deliver a trek through the perils that came with the Nixon scandal as we had experienced: terrifying, back-breaking, and, well, exhilarating. As every time we felt our hearts' racing, we wanted the audience to feel that rush just the same."\n\nThat being said, key figures within the Republican-Democrat Party have come forward in criticism of the movie, with the Republican-Democrats stating that "it puts a hole through our work in trying to help the United States." Meanwhile, spokespersons within the National Progressive Party have stated their "appreciation within Graham, Halberstam, and Pakula's work." Nevertheless, despite political experts' criticism, the American audience has driven in scores to theaters across the country to enjoy the "film of the decade," as some have called it."

It's bizarre, profane, provocative, and a gauntlet thrown onto the table of American literature.\n\nInspired by Kesey's work as a psychiatric orderly in Menlo Park, California, the novel follows one Randle McMurphy. McMurphy, a veteran of Scotland and proud street brawler, is sentenced to time in a psychiatric hospital for battery and illicit gambling. There, he meets a number of characters, including the novel's narrator, "Chief" Bromden, and the tyrannical head nurse, Nurse Ratched. Over the course of the novel, McMurphy challenges Ratched's rule, standing up for himself and the other patients in the ward. He is rewarded for this with a lobotomy, courtesy of Ratched. The novel ends with Bromden smothering McMurphy in an act of mercy, before escaping to freedom.\n\n"Cuckoo's Nest" has already garnered its fair share of accolades and controversy alike. Many are calling it a portrayal of America's own authoritarian systems, in an age when the nation is supposedly a bastion of liberty in the world.

So with their long flowing hair and picket signs and slogans, they packed Wall and Broad Streets by the thousands to profess their unconditional demands.\n\nThe city's working men disagreed. Among their most vocal is Peter J. Brennan, president of an alliance of New York's largest construction and engineering unions. To a man he and his fellow unionmen agreed: America had a moral obligation to protect democracy from fascism's encroachments not just at home, but also abroad. Dissent from the war effort was tantamount to treason. So with their hard hats, Old Glories and steel-toed boots, two hundred construction workers coalesced into a counter-protest in Federal Hall to profess their unconditional patriotism.\n\nAll that kept a semblance of order was a thin, shaky border of policemen sandwiched between two raucuous mobs.

Hippies and hard hats brawled each other out until they couldn't anymore, while a broad swathe of New York lay sacrificed as collateral damage.
