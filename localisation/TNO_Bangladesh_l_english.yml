 bangladesh.1.t:0 "The War of Independence"
 bangladesh.1.desc:0 "While we hoped for a peaceful road to independence, with the election of Mohan Singh, it seemed that peace would not come. And then things got worse. Singh, believing us to be unequal to the Hindus, only worsened our oppression, with such things as Operation Searchlight and sterilising our people.\n\nBut we have had enough! We aren't going to be taking any more of this oppression lightly. Today, we fight for our independence from India, and tomorrow, we shall enjoy it!"
 bangladesh.1.a:0 "Joy Bangla!"

 bangladesh.2.a:0 "We're all in this together!"
 
 bangladesh.3.t:0 "Plan B"
 bangladesh.3.desc:0 "Although we expected the war to go smoothly and quickly end with our independence, it seems that it hasn't been so kind. Now, with the war still going, our three most prominent generals have each come up with their own plans to secure Bengali independence.\n\nThe first of these is from M. A. G. Osmani. An older general, he still possesses the devotion that many of our young officers do. His plan is based around heavy use of military operation plans to prevent any attack by the INA upon our nation.\n\nSecondly is Khaled Mosharraf's plan. Based somewhat on guerilla warfare, he states that all bridges, supply lines, and anything to assist the enemy should be destroyed, no matter how civilian they are.\n\nFinally is Ziaur Rahman's plan. Taking inspiration from his fighting tactics, he proposes a large, dangerous push into enemy territory.\n\nAll three of these options have both their ups and downs. What plan should we decide on, to finish the war and win our independence?"
 bangladesh.3.a:0 "Planning is indespensible. Go with Osmani."
 bangladesh.3.b:0 "Burn and destroy the enemy's assistance. Mosharraf's plan is the best."
