 POLITICS_RASUL_GAMZATOV_DESC:0 "Rasul Gamzatovich Gamzatov grew up the heir to a long familial and cultural tradition of music and literature, with his father being a traditional Avar bard. But despite his rural upbringing, he was able to pursue an education, becoming the director of a theater in Khunzakh. But when the war was lost and the Nazis occupied the major cities, Gamzatov was forced to flee back to his home village. The Germans did not care to directly rule the countryside, instead opting for bombing runs and the occasional raid to capture new slaves for their mines. Music, theater, and poetry were some of the few things that provided a glimpse of happiness, and it was something that Gamzatov was eager to provide for his people.\n\nDuring the West Russian War, Gamzatov turned his services toward propagandizing and recruiting through the mountain villages for the Transcaucasian Soviet partisan group. Thousand enlisted thanks to his words, and eagerly marched off to battle with fresh shipments of West Russian and Kazakh arms. Few would return, but those who did said they were glad to have fought for a worthy cause. The years following the West Russian War were especially hard, as the brutal Reichskommissar Josias insisted on giving no quarter to the natives. Gamzatov hardly had to put any more effort into his speeches, for dozens of men would volunteer at every village as soon as he opened his mouth.\n\nJosias's death brought new opportunities for the Avar partisans, who eagerly seized cities and slew Germans all across their homeland. When asked about establishing a civilian government, many of them turned to the man that inspired them to fight in the first place. Gamzatov was called to lead the mean he once recruited, a task he took up with a joke that he had valuable leadership experience from directing acting troupes. But will he be able to guarantee Avar survival, or does the curtain call loom close in the future?"
