CZE_Mysterious_Insurgency:0 "Mysterious Insurgency"
CZE_Mysterious_Insurgency_desc:0 "Like many of the Reich's territories, Reichsprotektorat Böhmen-Mähren has its own resistance problem. However, this resistance is not like the others. There are numerous strange inconsistencies and coincidences with the current Czech resistance. For one, this resistance was once destroyed, having been stomped out in the late 40's before suddenly reappearing in recent years. For another, they are incredibly organized and competent. It seems as if they know our every move, and they always have a ready supply of guns, grenades, and ammo to murder our men. At times, they may be better equipped than our own garrison.\n\nTo make the situation worse, the brewing conflict in Germany proper with the SS has led to the Bohemian SS almost entirely refused to aid us in the investigation. While these resurgent partisans have been somewhat contained to this day, one can only wonder how many traitors are in our midst, and how deeply they have embedded themselves."
CZE_back_to_business:0 "Back to Business"
CZE_back_to_business_desc:0 "Under the careful guidance of Reichsprotektor Krosigk, Böhmen-Mähren  has already begun to recover from years of neglect and decay. Roads are patched up, factories reopen, trains run smoothly, and even the insurgency that has plagued the Reichsprotektorat for years has weakened somewhat, clearly from the improved living conditions of the average citizen. Things are looking up in Böhmen-Mähren  as the nation slowly closes back in on the inevitable goal of full Germanization."
CZE_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
CZE_martial_law_desc:0 "The resistance that we have been fighting for nearly a decade has revealed its true form- the SS! Chaos rules the countryside of Böhmen-Mähren  as the SS, once thought as mere nuisances and obstructionists, openly revolt against our forces. Across the Protektorat, villages and towns go dark in the chaos, either being overwhelmed by rebels or barricading themselves in against the suddenly ever-present SS legions.\n\nMartial law has been declared, but with the weak state of the government, it remains to be seen how much of an impact such a declaration even has on fixing the mess that Böhmen-Mähren  has suddenly become."
CZE_freedom_fever:0 "Freedom Fever"
CZE_freedom_fever_desc:0 "With the surrender of the final pockets of SS resistance in Böhmen-Mähren , order has finally been restored to the Protektorat. Guns fall silent, barricades come down, and the fearful citizens of all Bohemia can finally breathe easier knowing that the resistance that has dogged Böhmen-Mähren  for years is defeated. This victory has clearly resonated deeply with the people, as they celebrate in the streets to the news of Daleuge's capture.\n\nUnfortunately, as one problem dies, another rises. Some natives, clearly yet to Germanize, have taken the opportunity to begin to push pro-Czech propaganda onto the people. Those natives who still have a sense of nationalism have latched onto this, and a growing percentage of the population now not only marches in celebration, but in favor of independence. While this wave of unrest is sure to pass, we must deal with the consequences while it passes over us"
CZE_forced_germanization:0 "Forced Germanization"
CZE_forced_germanization_desc:0 "The black sun flies proudly over Prague, and with it comes the crashing wave of changes Kurt Daleuge and his men bring from the hills. Already, convoys of trucks loaded with SS soldiers roam the streets of Prague, busting and raiding any home suspected of pro-Czech activities. Those captured in these raids are quickly whisked away, never to be seen again. The reported Germanization rates have skyrocketed, as all either submit to the new regime or are silenced. In at least one part of Europe, it seems Himmler's dream of a pure Aryan state may be approaching reality."
CZE_until_death:0 "Until Death"
CZE_until_death_desc:0 "The decadent, self-serving Goring and his collection of brutes have finally returned to obliterate the Bohemian SS. They may think that we will simply cave in and collapse to him and his armies. No! We will hold every city, every town, every forest, every hill until we are all dead. Only when the final true Aryan in Böhmen-Mähren falls dead will the decadent Reich truly subjugate us. To arms, brothers! Fight to the final man!"
CZE_Unfinished_Integration:0 "Unfinished Integration"
CZE_Unfinished_Integration_desc:0 "The original plan for Böhmen-Mähren was to have the Protektorat become the first of the Reich's administrations to be directly integrated into the Reich proper. However, numerous events have come in the way of this, from financial collapse to the constant native resistance to the Russian invasion. As such, integration has come to a halt, and the Protektorat finds itself in a strange state of limbo, without the autonomy of the Reichskommissariats but still regarded as an autonomous part of Germany. This is an administrative disaster, and must be fixed as soon as possible."
CZE_Barracks_in_Chaos:0 "Barracks in Chaos"
CZE_Barracks_in_Chaos_desc:0 "With a constant rain of ballistic missiles bombarding our barracks, our armies have devolved into a state of chaos. Sleep, shelter or even just living another day have become and uncertainty. Fighting back is going to be much more difficult now."

POLITICS_LUTZ_GRAF_KROSIGK_DESC:0 "보수적인 변호사이자 불명예스러운 임기를 보냈던 전직 재무장관인 루츠 그라프 슈베린 폰 크로지크는 어느 모로 보아도 광대한 제국의 어느 영토를 통치하도록 맡기기에 최고의 인물은 아닙니다. 증오스러운 폰 파펜이 재무장관에 지명하고 국가사회주의가 정권을 뒤엎은 이후에도 그는 머리를 조아리고 히틀러의 모든 명령을 고분고분히 따르면서도 한편으로 당의 방침을 근면히 이끌어 나가며 자리를 보전했습니다. 경제를 지탱하는 능력을 증명해낸 그는 1950년대 경제붕괴 이후에도 문책을 피해갈 수 있을 정도로 총통의 신뢰와 존중을 얻는데 성공했습니다. 하지만 히틀러의 호의도 그의 직업을 지켜줄 수는 없었습니다.\n\n크로지크는 재무장관직에서 파면당했고 여러 정부 부처를 전전하며 이런저런 문서들 사이에서 방황하는 관료가 되어 버렸습니다. 마침내, 그가 살얼음 위에 서 있다는 사실을 깨달은 총통이 자비를 베풀었고 뵈멘-메렌 보호령의 국가보호자로 파견했습니다.\n\n크로지크는 공포와 총통에게 무엇을 이루었는지 보여주기 위한 투지가 뒤섞여 있는 국가보호령의 정치판에 발을 들여 놓았습니다. 뵈멘-메렌은 한 국가를 멸망시킨 자리에 수립된 잔해물로, 안 그래도 이미 박살난지 오래인 기반시설을 빨치산이 정기적으로 파괴하는 당연한 상황에 놓여 있습니다. 국가보호령이 제대로 기능하기 위해서는 몇 가지 사업과 개혁을 실시해야만 할 겁니다. 물론 독일이 그 개혁을 좋아하지 않을 지도 모르지만, 확실하지 않은 것으로 앞날을 막아서서는 안됩니다."
POLITICS_KURT_DALUEGE_DESC:0 "Born in a small Silesian town, Kurt Max Franz Daluege was always a German through and through, thriving in the military culture of the old empire. Daluege joined the Nazi Party in the early years, and soon moved onto the SS, serving as head of the Ordnungspolizei for many of the prewar years. It was a post perfectly suited for a sociopath such as himself, and Daluege was highly effective at crushing partisans and dissenters.\n\nSo it was that when Daluege was sent to Bohemia after the defeat of the Soviet Union it felt, to him, as if he was being stripped of his rank for little reason. But despite his distaste for the position, Daluege was convinced that he would return to the centre of German politics soon enough, and so he continued to exercise a callous cruelty towards those he watched over. As Himmler undertook his coup, Daluege could do nothing but watch from his post in Prague. The return to central German politics never came.\n\nLack of a position in the inner party did not truly put down Daluege, however. He has since built his network in Bohemia, even betraying SS principles and working with the Czech Resistance in the years after the West Russian War, allowing them to grow under his supervision and using them to undermine the garrison when he saw fit. When the civil war came, he called upon his network and chased the garrison out of Prague, declaring himself Oberstgruppenführer. There are few outside the SS who would support his coup, and the fanatical actions that are sure to follow.\n\nBut in Daluege's eyes, he has has been shunned long enough by Germania. Let decadent fools shout across the continent. Daluege now holds the power in Bohemia, and nobody, not in his own realm, not in Germany, not even in Burgundy, is going to take it from him."

CZE_a_change_in_the_status_quo:0 "A Change in the Status Quo"
CZE_a_change_in_the_status_quo_desc:0"Reichsprotektor Von Krosigk is much different from his predecessor. Instead of continuing the failed yet popular status quo, he wishes to change many of the systems currently in place in Böhmen-Mahren. Such reforms include much in the way of taking the hands off the reigns and letting the Czechs themselves do much of the army work, a policy which has ruffled many feathers among both hardliners and SS alike, though the SS has been suspiciously quieter than expected. However, Krosigk is dead-set on pushing these reforms through, and with his power over the state, who would stop him?"
CZE_a_toe_in_the_water:0"A Toe in the Water"
CZE_a_toe_in_the_water_desc:0"Krosigk's first move is to increase the native presence in the Böhmen-Mahren army. The formation of the Czech Guard, an all-native division of pro-german Czechs, will be the first step to what is hoped to be a loyal native army, freeing up our German boys for other duties. Plus, having Czechs in their own division will hopefully quell some native anger about misrepresentation. Of course, the hardliners see this as the end of the world, and the SS demands we put a stop to this degenerate foolishness, but what can they do?"
CZE_get_the_hint:0"Get the Hint"
CZE_get_the_hint_desc:0"It seems that Krosigk has realized the danger inherent to reforming the system. The SS, though they have said next to nothing to the Reichsprotektor, seemingly are arming themselves while the conservatives in the government demand an end to the madness and degeneracy, some even threatening to take this issue up to the Fuhrer himself. Though the SS haven't publicly said anything, the very obvious hints that they're throwing to the Reichsprotektor are loud and clear. The reforms will be significantly slowed and reduced, and hopefully the SS will put their guns away. There is no need for alarm."
CZE_sideline_the_ss:0"Sideline the SS"
CZE_sideline_the_ss_desc:0"The SS has been oddly quiet about the whole situation, refusing to publicly say anything on the matter. Though this must be one of Himmler's tricks, he can easily be outplayed here. A quick move here and there, and the SS can be effectively sidelined from actually doing anything about our reform. There will be no stopping this train of change, though the conservatives may scream and shout. The tides of reform will transform Böhmen-Mahren from a backwater to a pride of Germania!"

#CZE_back_to_business_desc:0"The period of reform has finished up, and it is time to truly get to work on improving Böhmen-Mahren. Infrastructure, industry, railroads-everything must be built if we wish to take the Protektorat from the backwater of the Reich to a jewel on the level of Germany itself. By bringing our focus back to improvements, we should also hopefully get the conservatives off our backs, something we need for stability.

CZE_revive_skoda_auto:0"Revive Skoda Auto"
CZE_revive_skoda_auto_desc:0"In the economic crash of the 50's, our closeness to the German economy became our downfall, as our already weak economy was dragged down with the collapse. One of the many victims of this crash was Skoda Auto, who has been barely making enough profits to keep itself from collapsing completely. If we direct state funds over to them, they can hopefully be boosted back onto their feet, and our economy will improve."

CZE_from_prague_to_germania_desc:0"Our infrastructure is atrocious. Trains and trucks often find themselves unable to effectively bring our resources to the heart of Germany, due to broken train tracks, cratered roads, and collapsed bridges. How many of these are from neglect or terrorism is unknown, but the fact remains that there aren't many intact roads. To fix this supply issue, we will expand the current connection to the German border and repair our main highways to speed up delivery. With these repairs, our infrastructure may finally be used as intended."

CZE_annual_army_checkup_desc:0"Our garrison, while small, has been bolstered earlier by the new Czech Guard.  However, there's always a need for improvement, and knowing about the problems that our garrison faces will help us in improving. As we do every year, we will check on their status and search for any discrepancies in terms of equipment, enrollment, payroll, and others. We will then check their combat training. With luck, they will pass with flying colors. Without luck, we'll be looking at a new round of training regimens. Here's hoping the men have been taking their courses."
CZE_designs_from_the_fatherland:0"Designs From the Fatherland"
CZE_designs_from_the_fatherland_desc:0"Our equipment is horrifically out of date. Many of our men are still using weapons from the 2nd World War, if not earlier. This situation has seriously hurt us, as these partisans seemingly always have better gear than us, and our men are regularly finding themselves outgunned. It is absolutely crucial that we get newer, better designs from Germania if we ever wish to defeat these absurdly well equipped partisans. By using our close ties with the Reichstag and Hitler himself, we will hopefully be able to get the blueprints for the newer models of rifles, artillery, and if we're lucky, perhaps tanks.""
CZE_inspect_the_ss:0"Raid Resistance Depots"
CZE_inspect_the_ss_desc:0"The Czech Resistance has been a constant spike in our side for over 20 years, with no sign of abating. Though they were once seemingly defeated, they have come back in full force, and the impact has been felt. Their surprising competence and seemingly endless supply of explosives has led to a road or bridge or building constantly blowing up almost every day. Ever since the crash of the 50's, we've been nearly powerless to stop them. However, with our new prosperity and the Czech Guard, we can finally begin to take action again. First off, we will raid known depot sites. Not only will this weaken the revolutionaries, but it will potentially bolster our own stock of weapons."
CZE_calm_the_party:0"Calm the Party"
CZE_calm_the_party_desc:0"Many elements of the Czech NSDAP are growing increasingly unhappy with the Reichsprotektor's actions. With the issue of the Czech Resistance seemingly unaffected by our reforms, and the economy still being below what we wanted, calls for Krosigk's removal have grown more and more prevalent. By making promises, deals, and in some cases simply begging for them to remain calm, we can hopefully bring the party back in line and continue on our current course. Hopefully, things do get better. Otherwise, we'll have a serious political problem on our hands."
CZE_the_steady_road_to_germanization:0"The Steady Road to Germanisation"
CZE_the_steady_road_to_germanization_desc:0"In spite of all the dangers and attacks on our system, it seems that the Reich Protektorat continues on a somewhat stable course. Germanization continues to improve with each passing year, and our position as one of the more successfully germanizing states of the Reich remains. Our position, while not unassailable and still somewhat shaky, is still able to complete its assigned goal of turning these natives into proud sons of Germany. Here's to hoping that it stays that way."

CZE_the_czech_guard:0"The Czech Guard"
CZE_the_czech_guard_desc:0"The pitiful German Garrison we currently have is barely able to hold Prague together at the best of times. It is beyond obvious that we need to expand our forces, yet Germany refuses to send us men in these times, recruitment is incredibly low, and the SS is unhelpful at best and downright obstructionary at worst. To secure the countryside, we need to form a Czech Guard.  Multiple divisions of Pro-German Czechs will be enough to get our Garrison back up and running. With adequate training, equipment, and pay, we can hopefully replace much of our missing German manpower with Czech men. Who knows, perhaps we'll finally stomp out the resistance."
CZE_follow_the_ss_model:0"Follow the SS Model"
CZE_follow_the_ss_model_desc:0"As despicable as the SS is, it must be said that they are by far the best equipped and trained force in the Protektorat. Their men, when they're actually used in counter-insurgency operations, constantly bring back good results. If we ask for some of their higher ranking officers as teachers and advisors, and request some of their equipment, the guard will unquestionably be better off than it will if we reject their help entirely. Of course, letting the SS anywhere near anything usually leads to issues, and we must calculate the risk of allowing their men to supervise and train what will amount to most of the Garrison. Still, do we really have any other choice?"
CZE_a_brand_new_system:0"A Brand New System"
CZE_a_brand_new_system_desc:0"The SS is much too dangerous to entrust with the training of what will become the majority of our garrison. Who knows what they would do with such power and influence? Though they may have the best training, guns, and other equipment, there is no way we can give them such influence. Instead, we shall create our own system, similar to that of the Wehrmacht. Though we may have worse equipment, training, and other important necessities, we will at least know that the Czech Guard is on our side, and not on Himmler's."
CZE_a_competent_army:0"A Competent Army"
CZE_a_competent_army_desc:0"The most important part of any army is training. An army can have the best equipment available, and still be defeated due to incompetence and poor training. We cannot let the Guard be routed by experienced partisans in the countryside. However, the question remains on what doctrine we will use to actually train the men. This must be decided quickly and efficiently, or else we will have a confused, disorganized mob instead of a true division of men. However, if we take too long training, the partisans may be able to do large amounts of damage while the Guard is still learning the basics. If we train them too little, they will be routed in the field nd all our work will be for naught. We must choose which poison we wish to take."
CZE_a_modern_army:0"A Modern Army"
CZE_a_modern_army_desc:0"Though training is the most important part of any army, good equipment can never be underestimated. The Partisans have been supplied with many near modern guns, supposedly from their many raids on our armories, while our garrison up to this point has been mainly equipped with weapons from either the Second World War or the West Russian War. If we want our men to excel, we should try and purchase modern weapons from Germany proper. Of course, there is much fluttering and heated debate about the cost of buying so many guns and trucks, which would undoubtedly be astronomically high. Many say that such a purchase could possibly undo the gains we have made. We must decide whether modern equipment truly is worth it."
CZE_a_loyal_army:0"A Loyal Army"
CZE_a_loyal_army_desc:0"Finally, we must decide on how close we scrutinize recruits for the Guard, checking for loyalty. It is no question that an army must be loyal to the state, or we will have even worse resistance problems. With the amount the resistance has proliferated through Czech society, we must decide whether we want loyalty or men. After all, if we scrutinize for loyalty too closely, we may not be able to find actual men to put into the guard. If we don't scrutinize closely enough, resistance fighters could, god forbid, gain access to the resources of the government itself, which would be an unmitigated disaster. The real question is which one we need more: loyalty, or men?"
CZE_a_new_life:0"A New Life"
CZE_a_new_life_desc:0"Recruitment for the Guard has been lower than we would like it. It seems that the Czech's aren't very excited to fight their own brothers and sisters in the Resistance.

With good poster design and enough pay, any Czech can be turned from a revolutionary into a soldier of the Reich."
CZE_review_the_budget:0"Review the Budget"
CZE_review_the_budget_desc:0"The cost of paying all of our new Guardsmen is starting to catch up to our budget, as our already small profit margin grows smaller and smaller with each new recruit. Evidently, we need to either cut spending somewhere else or we need to stop our recruitment until profits rise again. Neither option is a good one, but simply leaving the budget unchanged will only lead to another crash, and god knows we don't need that again."
CZE_calm_the_fatherland:0"Calm the Fatherland"
CZE_calm_the_fatherland_desc:0"Germany itself has begun looking upon our Czech Guard with a suspicious eye. It appears that they seem to think that we are losing control in such a way that we need the natives to do our work for us. While this may be partially true, the Guard is both necessary and beneficial to our Protektorat. By sending a representative over to the Reichstag, we can calm the alarm-sounders and restore their confidence in our work. We know what we're doing, we promise!"

However, as much as we wish to throw them in to deal with our problems immediately, throwing a new unit into the deep end of operations usually leads to trouble and casualties, both of which we can't afford. Instead, we will put them in the shallow, easy operations.

While this news in of itself is terrifying, the true terror arose from the second report- we have found conclusive evidence that the perpetrator is not simply Partisans, but the SS itself! In fact, the partisans have been the SS the entire time! The entire organization has melted away into the forests and woods, leaving the entire Protektorat in chaos and confusion. Order in the cities burns as riots explode into the streets, and simply disappears in the countryside as panicked citizens arm themselves and bunker down.

Our advisors say that with this manpower boost, we should be able to enforce our so far claimed martial law.

Their limp-wristed liberalism and utter weakness at controlling the people have led to Böhmen-Mahren being a heaven for rebellious slavs and traitors. We, the SS, will not be forgiving and decadent. If a weak hand breeds rebellion and discontent, a hard hand will lead to order and stability, something the Protektorat has badly needed for decades. We will be victorious!

Some have become paranoid, watching anyone outside the garrison with suspicion and fear. This is an unsustainable situation and it will surely lead to our downfall if no action is taken.

Luckily, we never committed any really harsh reprisals against them, while the SS has massacred their villages. It's clear who the good guy in this fight is to them. We must capitalize on this feeling, apologize for any atrocities we may or may not have committed, and get them on our side. With the natives with us, the SS will have nowhere to hide."

By digging in across streets and hills, we can set up a truly formidable position against any attacks. Sure, it can't be too in depth, as we don't have the resources for that, but some defense is better than nothing, and every day we hold Prague successfully is another day closer to our own final victory."

By simply waiting out the siege instead of sallying out of the walls, we can exhaust the traitors before attempting to recover our lost lands.

However, up until now, they have only been recognized as an informal, government-sanctioned militia. This means that they have been paid less, are less equipped, and are poorly trained.

To make matters worse, that traitor Krosigk clearly understands the cities importance just as much as we do, as he has fortified in and around Prague. Attempting a full frontal offensive without first weakening these positions is nearly suicidal, and as such we will begin to worm around the city, slicing its supply lines one by one.

The overlying issue is that we now have a rash of weapons running amok among the populace, something that could very quickly come back to bite us if there was to ever be a real resistance movement again. As we learned with the SS, preparing or disarming an issue before it can even begin is the most intelligent strategy we could take to this volatile situation.

When Germany drags itself from the muck of war, as they will, they will find a waiting, excited, and loyal Protektorat still waiting for them. Krosigk himself has been redeemed, and will surely find a spot in whatever administration will emerge victorious in the Fatherland.

### Events

CZE.1.t:0 "Keeping A Secret"
CZE.1.d:0 "He sat at his desk, his fingers running through his hair and a lamp illuminating his desk. The clock on the wall reads 1:53 am. Once the Finance Minister of the entire Reich, now he sits in disgrace here in an office in Prague. Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk contemplated his future and the future of the Reich. Papers and pictures line his desk and the walls, and Hitler's warning rebounds in his head.\n\n"This is your final chance, Krosigk. Do not let me down again."\n\nOnce a highly held and trusted member of Hitler's inner circle, Krosigk's good standing all came crashing down with the economy during the 50's. Though Hitler protected him from summary execution, he could not save his job. After years of meaningless paper shuffling, Krosigk's chance has come again. It is not a good chance.\n\nReports overflow onto the floor, detailing destruction and confusion. The Reichsprotektorat is filled with troubles, from a surprisingly competent native resistance to a nearly silent SS. The worst problem, however, is the loud and proud number of conservative men in Krosigk's Administration. These men do more damage to Krosigk's plans than any resistance could, screaming and raving about any reform Krosigk tries. On multiple occasions, they've even threatened to take their issues up to Germania itself, and if Germania heard of Krosigk's plans... \n\nKrosigk's plans involve a lot of changes and freedoms for the natives, something that the Reichstag would blow a fuse at if they heard of it. On the other hand, the Protektorat is in a death spiral, succumbing to the slow, constant collapse that seems to pervade through all of the Reich's territories. Without these reforms, Krosigk will never regain his honor, and Böhmen-Mähren will never grow to the heights it can reach.\n\nIn that late hour, Krosigk made his choice. He will not sit by and watch his land collapse. He will rise to the challenge, and he will make Böhmen-Mähren a jewel through reform and native rights. Germany only needs to know of the ends and not the means, after all."
CZE.1.a:0 "Keep quiet. . ."

CZE.2.t:0 "The Czech Guard is Formed!"
CZE.2.d:0 "Success came early for Reichsprotektor Von Krosigk, as news has arrived that the party approved the formation of a new, all-native division - the Czech Guard. Independent from both the SS and Wehrmacht, this proposal has raised much controversy among the more conservative members of our administration. Our garrison itself is completely incapable of dealing with the amount of resistance that we currently face, so this is a great help for our forces. However, the conservatives and the SS have raised quite the stink about handing over guns and training to the natives, claiming that this equipment will only be found in the resistance in a few months. Though we have kept them from taking it up to Germania itself for now, it is unknown how much more they are willing to concede before they tire of our games. Foreign Minister Rudolf Touissaint, who was a firm supporter of the Guard, has offered to help train these men, an offer that we will happily accept. For now, the Guard is only a planned force, but soon we will have a whole new army of loyal Bohemians to help keep order in Böhmen-Mähren."
CZE.2.a:0 "We can trust these Czechs."

CZE.3.t:0 "Reform Slapped Down!"
CZE.3.d:0 "Krosigk checked his daily mail. After months on the job, he was accustomed to what was  regularly delivered to him. 5 reports, a financial report, and a political briefing. He had seen it all a hundred times.\n\nWhat he didn't expect to see was an 8th letter. This one, unlike the others, bore the sticker of the Reichstag. A direct message from Germania itself.\n\nA sinking feeling formed in Krosigk's gut as he tore open the letter. That sinking turned to a freefall when his suspicions were confirmed. The message was a declaration from the Reichstag, decrying his "ridiculous reforms" and demanding "an immediate end to these measures". Should Krosigk resist and continue, "your position in the party will immediately be revoked". All in all, the message was clear.\n\nKrosigk tossed the paper to the side in frustration. He sank into his chair, cursing his own foolishness. He had been an idiot to believe that the conservatives and SS would remain silent. Now, as he reached for his phone to call off the reforms, he could only hope that an opportunity to fix the Protektorat would come sooner rather than later."
CZE.3.a:0 "Clearly, they cannot keep a secret."

CZE.4.t:0 "The Army Checks Up"
CZE.4.d:0 "When Reichsprotektor Von Krosigk stepped out of his car and marched towards the barracks of the Garrison, he reminded himself to keep his expectations down. These men were equipped poorly, trained poorly, and assembled poorly. They would not be near the quality of the Wehrmacht, or the SS. However, he thought, they surely can't be too bad.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nThe Garrison's performance was abysmal. There were constant shortages of equipment, low organization and morale, and poor shooting. An attempt at a mortar barrage almost ended in disaster when the shells nearly landed on top of a trench filled with soldiers. The few armored cars the Garrison had quickly either stalled or ran out of fuel.  It would almost be funny, if these were not the men who were expected to protect the nation. Von Krosigk could only scoff in disgust - they were trusting these fools to protect the Protektorat? No wonder the partisans were so successful.\n\nAs the delegation walked away from the mess of a drill, Krosigk could only thank the Lord for having blessed him with the idea of the Czech Guard. Hopefully, those men would be much better off than these fools in dress-up."
CZE.4.a:0 "Another problem to fix."

CZE.5.t:0 "The Raids Commence"
CZE.5.d:0 "On a quiet afternoon in the middle of the Bohemian countryside, truck after truck rumbled down a dirt road. Inside of them, Garrison men sat at the ready, hoping to finally drive a dagger into these damnable partisans. Today, they were finally going on the offensive.\n\nThese trucks came to a halt around 500 meters from a small, hidden warehouse in the middle of the forest, hidden by the hills. The men dismounted and moved forward, fingers on their triggers and heads on a swivel. Any moment now, a partisan would see them, or they would see a partisan, and the real fight would begin.\n\nAt 250 meters from the warehouse, the men became confused. Were they walking into a trap? Was there a mistake? Were the partisans really just so careless, or perhaps foolhardy, that they left a major weapons cache undefended? Either way, they were urged on by their superiors, who were eager to lay their hands on the equipment that lay inside that building.\n\nOnce they reached the warehouse, still with no resistance, the Garrison surrounded the building. Men stacked up on the walls as a soldier grabbed his rifle, ready to shoot off the lock. With a bang and a crash, the doors flew open and the men flew into the room.\n\nThe empty room. \n\nThere was nothing there, save for some bullets that had been laid on the ground. The bullets mocked the men, taunting them. One frustrated private, tired and angry, kicked the stack of bullets, spilling them across the room with the sound of clanking metal.\n\nThe worst part? This same scene played out across every single raid. Not one group found anything more than a few bullets. It is clear now - the partisans knew we were coming. We must confront the fact that we have been infiltrated, possibly at the highest levels."

CZE.6.t:0 "Everything Is Alright"
CZE.6.d:0 "It seems that recent events have shaken the people's confidence in the government. Our own party distrusts us, and the people live in fear of these partisans that constantly attack us and our infrastructure. All in all, the feeling in Böhmen-Mähren is one of dread and terror. This is not a productive stance for a nation to be in, and as such Reichsprotektor Von Krosigk has given a public speech emphasizing the safety and stability of the Protektorat. Extolling "proud German values" such as "obedience, loyalty, and a steadfast resolve"Krosigk's speech has been widely regarded as a success across the nation. While our subjects are not relaxed, there is a noticeable change in the atmosphere and the economy has seen an upturn. All in all, it seems Krosigk has kept everyone calm and collected. Hopefully, this feeling will last."
CZE.6.a:0 "We are doing just fine, thank you very much."

CZE.7.t:0 "The Ship Steadies"
CZE.7.d:0 "Krosigk has been proving himself to Germania in recent months. In contrast to the many other Reichskommissariats, which flounder and fail in their mission of germanization, recent surveys show that the rates of germanization in Böhmen-Mähren have steadily increased under Krosigk's regime. In addition to this, the Garrison has become more and more effective, while the partisan attacks that have dogged the Protektorat for nearly a decade have begun to slack off. It is clear to all now that Krosigk had the right idea this entire time. The conservatives have grown quieter with each rebuke of their foolishness, and Germania is undoubtedly buzzing with the news of our success here. Truly, Hitler has made the right choice in appointing Krosigk."

CZE.8.t:0 "The SS Trains The Guard"
CZE.8.d:0 "After an unprecedented 8 hour meeting, the heads of the Protektorat left the first session on the formation of the Czech Guard with a mixture of confusion, anger, and resignation. The main topic of the session - the model that the Guard should follow - became one of the most heated topics to ever fly through the halls. Barbs were exchanged, statistics were presented, and multiple outbursts of anger from all sides blasted each other. At the end of the day, however, Krosigk had to make the damning decision. In his own words, "Though the SS has been proven to be untrustworthy at times, the fact remains that we have no other option if we wish for a well equipped, well trained force." This statement led to intense criticism, as reformists and conservatives united against the choice, but at the end of the day, the Reichsprotektor has the final say. Effective immediately, Daluege has promised to send advisors to the training facilities, along with some of their best equipment. Though it is true that the SS will undoubtedly use this to their advantage, it's not like we have another option if we wish for this force to be effective. Still, the fact remains: we have taken what will be the bulk of our force and dropped it in the hands of the SS. Hopefully, they will remain true to our cause."
CZE.8.a:0 "Keep an eye on those advisors."

CZE.9.t:0 "We Go Our Own Way"
CZE.9.d:0 "After a marathon 8 hour meeting, the heads of the Reichsprotektorat left the first session on the Czech Guard with a mixture of determination and confidence.The main topic of the session - the model that the Guard should follow - became one of the most heated topics to ever fly through the halls. Barbs were exchanged, statistics were presented, and multiple outbursts of anger from all sides blasted each other. However, at the end of the day, Krosigk made the tough choice. Forgoing the benefits and equipment of the SS, Krosigk stated "The numerous cases of SS treachery makes it simply impossible for us to trust them with the training of our men, regardless of their equipment." Though this accusation was hotly contested by Daluege, his complaints were quickly slapped down, and the council adjourned. Instead of using SS advisors, the Czech Guard will be trained with forces from our own Garrison. While we will not be getting any equipment or elite guidance from the SS, at least we can rest easy knowing that the Czech Guard will be with us and not them."
CZE.9.a:0 "We made the correct choice, right?"

CZE.10.t:0 "Quality Of The Guard?"
CZE.10.d:0 "The formation of the Czech Guard has hit another snag.  The council has divided itself over the issue of how much we are to train the Czech Guard, with no clear victor in sight and Krosigk so far remaining silent. One party claims that, in order to make the Guard as effective as possible, we should train the forces as much as possible, at the expense of time. Detractors of this position claim that keeping them in training will allow the partisans to gain strength while the guardsmen are learning the ropes, as well as running the risk of giving potential resistance fighters military training. They instead believe that the Guard should be kept down with only militia level training, which would decrease effectiveness but increase the speed of training and make any defections less dangerous. A third party believes that the Guard should just have German officers from the Garrison transferred over to ensure loyalty and rid ourselves of officer training times. However, this would weaken the Garrison proper, and a language barrier would have to be overcome. Each of these arguments has their own merits, but at the end of the day, Krosigk can only use one. As the meeting comes to a close, all eyes turn to the Reichsprotektor."
CZE.10.a:0 "A militia will do quite nicely."
CZE.10.b:0 "We need these men to be the best."
CZE.10.c:0 "Loyalty must be kept."

CZE.11.t:0 "Layout Of The Guard"
CZE.11.desc:0 "With the issue of training out of the way, the topic now turns to how these divisions should be formed. Again, numerous camps have formed, each advocating for its own solution to this issue. While the initial plan called for the Guard to be trained in Mountain Warfare, numerous other suggestions have been placed. One calls for the Czech Guard to be an armored division, giving us much needed firepower. However, this is only possible with the use of SS equipment. Another calls for these units to be trained to work artillery, an interesting proposal which would give us a hard hitting punch on the field. Indeed, we could make these into motorized artillery units with the help of the SS. A third proposal calls for simple infantry training to be undertaken by these men, making them valuable front line units instead of specialized mountaineers. These divisions can also be motorized with SS help. The day grows long, and once again Von Krosigk must make a choice that could decide victory or defeat on the battlefield."
CZE.11.a:0 "We stick with the plan"
CZE.11.b:0 "Tanks would be immensely useful against mere partisans."
CZE.11.c:0 "Big guns will shatter their morale and their positions. Use those."
CZE.11.d:0 "We don't need specialization. Just give us a good infantry unit."

CZE.12.t:0 "Supervising The Guard"
CZE.12.d:0 "Another heated debate has derailed the planning process for the Czech Guard. This time, the topic has turned to the loyalty of the Guard. Daluege has brought up the fact that the Czech Guard may be infiltrated by resistance members, and proposed to have his SS do regular check ups on them to "ensure cooperation", as he put it. Toussaint, the main force behind the Guard, has fiercely attacked this statement, claiming that this is a mere power grab by the SS and that the Guard need no supervision. Frank, conservative that he is, has proposed a compromise by having the Wehrmacht and Garrison do the check-ins. This debate has turned from a fiery shouting match into a stony silence, as the men wait for Krosigk's decision. Whichever way he goes, it is bound to anger someone in the room. Here's hoping they won't fall to blows."
CZE.12.a:0 "These men are trustworthy! What will it look like if we investigate our own men?"
CZE.12.b:0 "They need someone to watch them, and the army can do just that."
CZE.12.c:0 "The SS is specifically here to watch over the natives, are they not?"

CZE.13.t:0 "Deploying The Guard"
CZE.13.d:0 "The end is near in terms of planning out the Czech Guard. It seems the final major question that has been brought up is where to initially deploy the Guard once they finish their training. Touissant and Frank have both advocating for giving them an easier job initially, having them garrison forts in the heartland of Bohemia. This strategy, they claim, will give them experience without ripping them to shreds. Though we won't be using them offensively to start, they will be able to fight from good positions, and the deployment will help them get even better at their jobs. To the contrary, Daluege and Bertsch have pushed to deploy them immediately, allowing them to fight offensively and obliterate these partisans from the get-go. They claim that there is no time to lose, and that the best training field is the battlefield, after all. Though they do concede that this will cause more casualties, Daluege has said that "only the best will survive, and the best will now be veterans". Both of these positions have merit, and this choice will decide how quickly we deal with this partisan problem while also choosing how many casualties we will have to replace. Krosigk must decide."
CZE.13.a:0 "We cannot risk destroying our new division so quickly."
CZE.13.b:0 "These partisans must be dealt with immediately. Send them in."

CZE.14.t:0 "The Guard Is Formed"
CZE.14.d:0 ""Alright, my friends. We've gone through everything. Morale, supervision, equipment, training, advisors- if anything, we've overdone it. If anyone has any complaints, raise them now."\n\n Krosigk, eyebags clearly apparent, looked up at the rest of the room. The clock on the wall read the ungodly hour of 4:32 a.m. Everyone at the table seemed to have had the life sucked out of them 8 hours ago. Touissant slumped over papers, Frank loosely held an empty mug, Bertsch tiredly adjusted his glasses- even Daluege, who prided himself on his constant attentiveness, seemed listless. The room was silent.\n\nA faint smile crossed Krosigk's lips. After 2 weeks and countless hours of debate and argument, the debacle of the Czech Guard was settled.\n\n "Very well. If nobody has another complaint, I declare the Czech Guard to be an official organization of the Protektorat. Initial training will begin shortly. Now, gentlemen- go get some rest. We've all earned it."\n\n The men dragged themselves out of the room, and the Czech Guard turned from concept into reality."
CZE.14.a:0 "Took us long enough."

CZE.15.t:0 "The Guard Is Ready"
CZE.15.d:0 "The smell of gas permeated through the air, as truck after truck roared down the road towards Prague. To the side of this road stood Reichsprotektor Krosigk, who watched with a smile as his plan came to fruition. Months of political fighting, maneuvering, and a lot of letters to Germania later, and the result was finally in front of him.\n\nHowever, this victory had a bitter aftertaste. Sure, these trucks and new guns were beautiful and strong, but they had one source. The SS was responsible for this equipment. It was responsible for the training. And undoubtedly, it had implanted its own diabolical intents into what should have been a simple defense force. Yes, these men had modern equipment. Yes, they had the best training. The simple problem was that they also may have SS sympathies.\n\nKrosigk shook these thoughts from his head. Needless pessimism can drag a country to its knees, and most of these Czechs were known loyalists. There was no way that many of them could be SS agents. Still, one had to wonder if Daluege had any special plans.\n\nFor now, however, the knives of the Garrison just got a lot sharper. Perhaps now that reinforcements have arrived, peace and order can return to the Protektorat."
CZE.15.a:0 "May all the partisans tremble in fear."

CZE.16.t:0 "The Guard Is Ready"
CZE.16.d:0 "Dust hung heavy in the air as the men of the Czech Guard marched towards Prague. To the side of the road stood Reichsprotektor Von Krosigk, who watched with a smile as his plans came to fruition in front of his eyes. After months of political infighting, letters to Germania, and struggle for the scraps of spare equipment, the Czech Guard was a fully formed force.\n\n However, one could not help but notice the raggedy state of some of the guard. If one was to look closely, they would see that many of the rifles that were so proudly carried dated back to the Second Great War. One would also note the lack of trucks, forcing the Guard to go on foot. Finally, even in parade formation, the Guard slouched and dragged their feet. This lack of discipline was undoubtedly noted by Daluege, as he would surely gloat about the superior makeup and training of his own SS. No doubt that he would pull up that these men would look a lot better with SS equipment and training.\n\nKrosigk shook these thoughts from his head. After all, despite the lack of modern equipment and training, the guard was certainly free of any SS influence. If Daluege was planning anything, he would have a major barrier to get through now. For now, however, the Garrison celebrated. Their knives had gotten a lot sharper. Perhaps now, peace can finally return to the Protektorat."
CZE.16.a:0 "May all the partisans tremble in fear."

CZE.17.t:0 "Betrayal!"
CZE.17.d:0 "After news of what happened in Lidice reached Prague, the murky shape of the Czech Resistance became clear. The SS, the god damn traitors that they are, have secretly been the resistance the entire time.\n\nKrosigk, receiving the news, immediately ordered the arrest of every SS agent in Böhmen-Mähren. Unfortunately, he was too late. Garrison trucks screeched to a halt outside of SS headquarters, only to find a raging fire gutting the building. This same scene played out across the Protektorat as the SS, obviously being tipped off, retreated into the countryside. Dalauge has gone missing with the rest of his henchmen, evidently having been behind the entire sham. While Dalauge has not declared open rebellion, it is clear that a serious struggle between the Garrison and the SS has broken out. Across Böhmen-Mähren, villages and towns go silent as they fearfully bunker down from the SS raiders. Though a civil war may not have officially engulfed the protektorat, there is no doubt that the country has been split. We can only bunker down and pray that we weather the storm."
CZE.17.a:0 "God help us."

CZE.18.t:0 "Rebellion!"
CZE.18.d:0 "Once the reports of our actions in Lidice hit the desk of the traitorous Reichsprotektor, our agents knew the game was up. In the early hours of the morning, the SS abandoned their posts and buildings, leaving nothing but dust, ashes, and flame in their wake. Now, we hide in the hills and woods of Bohemia. Our leader, Daluege, has already taken command of our new army. Now, we can finally obliterate those traitors who dare sully the perfection of the Aryan race with their foolish reforms.\n\n Unfortunately, we have hit a snag in our plans. Our supplies are only enough to last us a short while, and it seems unlikely that we will be able to consistently replenish our forces. While a weakling may panic over this, Daluege only uses it as an incentive for a swift, fast, and easy takeover. After all, those weaklings in the garrison and their native whipping boys in the Guard are no match for a true aryan son of Germany.\n\nNow, it is the time to strike. Forward, brothers, and fight for our race! For Himmler, for the Aryan man, and for the future of the Germanic people!"
CZE.18.a:0 "To victory!"

CZE.19.t:0 "The SS Strikes First"
CZE.19.d:0 "The first blow in the struggle for Böhmen-Mähren has fallen today, and it strikes like a hammer. One of the many towns that have bunkered down in the last few days was the small town of Lezaky, which went silent about a week ago. Today, a convoy sent to check on them has returned with a very ugly report.\n\nThe town, just like Lidice, has been burnt to the ground. In fact, the place has been all but razed, to the point where if the convoy's commander had no map, the ground had not been charred, and corpses had not been strewn about, it would have been possible to entirely miss it. This shocking show of brutality has only served to drop morale even lower and spread panic among the populace, who has learned of this atrocity despite our efforts to contain it. It is believed that there are no survivors.\n\nIf there is one lesson to learn from this massacre, it is that the SS is not holding anything back. They have pulled out all the stops to acheive victory, and we must do the same if we wish to hold back the black tide."

CZE.20.t:0 "Attack On The Guard"
CZE.20.d:0 "The day dawned bright and cold on the Protektorat. Across the whole of Böhmen-Mähren, a relative calm was noted in the major cities. Many of the citizens simply took this as a blessing and carried on with their days. This relative calm was a constant in all places but one.\n\nIn a field just south of Prague, chaos was in full force. The grass burned and charred, disabled and destroyed vehicles slumped in craters like broken beasts, and the screams of the dying and silence of the dead permeated through the air. A close look at these corpses mainly showed the symbol of the Czechs, though some did bear the double lightning of the SS.  Through a quick glance, one would assume that the Guard had truly shown itself as what it was-- not a hardened group of native soldiers, but a mob of those the SS deemed inferior to the Aryan, only there to be obliterated under the German's jackboot.\n\nAnd yet, when the gunfire died down and the dying, one by one, fell silent, groups of men emerged from behind the wrecks and from the ditches. They wandered about, checking the dead and counting who had survived. A feeling of both shock and joy ran through the men-- shock at the deaths of their friends and the ferocity of the SS assault, and joy at their own resolve and bravery, to have stood against the black beast and, with every fiber in their collective beings, beaten it back.\n\nOne could not say they had won, but one could not say they had lost. The Guard had survived."
CZE.20.a:0 "We will survive."

CZE.21.t:0 "Attack On The Guard"
CZE.21.d:0 "Bullets streaked over Andrej's head as he dove into the ditch. Rainwater splashed around his knees as he struggled to bring his rifle back on target. Next to him sat two men. Men he didn't recognize, but clearly men from the Guard. After all, they wore the insignia of the guard.\n\nAn explosion rocked the men, as an already wrecked truck all but disintegrated, shredding any poor soul that was behind it. Shrapnel embedded itself into the ground near the ditch where Andrej hid. A few feet in front of him, another group of men covered their heads as mud rained around them. Andrej cursed and reloaded his rifle. He could only wonder in shock and despair how it had gotten to this point. One moment, he and the rest of the Guard had been peacefully riding down the road towards Prague. The next moment, mortars and bullets had shattered trucks and men alike, and the dogs in the SS charged the militiamen. It was as if God had personally struck down the Guard. Andrej could only hope that whatever was left of his brothers could hold on until reinforcements arrived.\n\nA red flare shot up out of the woods and into the sky, seemingly by mistake. The SS had no air support that was known of, and they certainly didn't need help. Andrej could only wonder at what it meant.\n\nSuddenly, movement from the crater in front of him caught his attention. The third man looked up at the flare, froze for a moment, and suddenly stood. The rattle of the man's machine gun cut through the air as easily as it cut through the Guardsmen in the crater with him. Andrej watched with horror and aimed his rifle at the lunatic.\n\nAnd then he heard the click of a Luger besides him.\n\nAndrej had just enough time to catch a glimpse of an SS necklace, hidden behind the man's jacket, before a crack split the air and Andrej was no more."

Clearly, the SS owns the countryside, and from here it is only a matter of time to our inevitable victory. At least, that is what the rank and file of the SS thinks.\n\nIn private, Daluege has been reported to be . . . upset at the survival of any of the Guard. After all, the remnants of the Guard that were seemingly looked over will fight another day, and our losses were higher than expected. Though we have indeed won the battle, every day without a truly crushing victory is a day in which our supplies dwindle further and further, and we may have missed our chance for the decisive battle. Though our cause is not yet hopeless, and the Guard has been crippled, there is a certain feeling of tension among the higher-ups in camp. One can only hope that our opportunity has not slipped through our fingers."

Each report contains the same message: the ambush was an overwhelming success, with a reported 100% enemy casualty rate. In other words, the feeble natives of the Czech Guard has been all but annihilated under the true Germanic soldier.\n\nEven the traditionally spartanist soldiers of the SS have engaged in drinking and partying at this unrivaled success. Rumors even say that Daluege himself has engaged in light drinking. With the death of the Guard, the traitors in Prague have been substantially weakened, and now it will be simple to sweep into the city and reclaim Böhmen-Mähren.

One ragged looking soldier, his helmet dented and his uniform ripped, returning to the base, blubbering about demons in Czech Guard uniforms and hellfire raining upon the SS. He was quickly taken to a secluded corner and silenced, and for a while, that was all the camp heard of the SS's ambush on the guard.\n\nThen the floodgates opened, and tens of men poured through the camp entrance in shame and defeat. The man who had to give the report to Daluege shook with fear as he read what could possibly be the most shocking news to ever reach the men's ears-- The SS, the purest sons of Germany, had ambushed the mongrels and mutts of the Czech Guard and lost. Where they rushed from the trees expecting a disorganized mob to run and hide, they instead were met with disciplined, concentrated fire, and after a short, one-sided battle, been forced to retreat, leaving their dead behind.\n\nThe reporter was right to be terrified, as Daluege rose from his seat and swiftly ordered the execution of all the cowards who had ran. Unfortunately, this was not enough. Panic and confusion now rips through the ranks of the SS, as their untarnished record has been dirtied by the Czech Guard of all people. Daluege has been rumored to be in a drunken rage against all those cowards who dared to flee. Whatever the result, it is clear that the invulnerability of the SS has been irrevocably shattered. It remains to be seen whether victory can be salvaged from the coup's disastrous start."

However, as more and more memos, all with similar messages, began spitting through the mail slot, the secretary forwarded it to a frustrated Krosigk, who took the letter and slammed his office door shut.\n\nThere was a moment of silence, presumably as Krosigk read the letter.Then the secretary heard laughter, first faint and quiet, then blossoming into huge peals of giddy joy. Krosigk burst from the room and immediately ordered the secretary to spread the news far and wide, and to organize a victory parade for the Czech Guard. He then burst from the room, whooping and laughing, searching for Toussaint. After all, the Guard was his idea, and it seemed to have paid off in spades.\n\nWhen the news was leaked, crowds flooded the streets of Prague, cheering and dancing. The men of the Czech Guard, battered, bruised, but triumphant, rode through the crowded streets as flowers, jewelry, and money was thrown to the heroes of Böhmen-Mähren. Though the SS, battered as it was, was still out there in the woods, that night saw the people of Prague celebrating like the struggle was over.

CZE.27.t:0 "Contacting Himmler"
CZE.27.d:0 "Despite us taking as many guns and bullets as we could from our stockpiles, we have begun to run into supply issues. Of course, this is easily fixable. By using our SS status, we contacted our brothers in Burgundy and have gained their support. The first guns will be arriving soon, and with our supply lines secured, it seems our victory is assured.\n\nAt least, that is what the plan detailed.\n\nIn practice, it seems that the chaos that envelops Germany has sliced cleanly through our lines to Himmler, for we have received no reply to our calls for aid. Though this should theoretically be impossible, this disconnect is understandable. After all, the main struggle in Germany most likely takes precedence, and there is the possibility that one of the other contenders for Germania has broken up our communication lines. Either way, it's clear that, for now, no help is coming. We will have to make do with what we can get.\n\nHowever, strange whispers have been permeating our forces. Apparently, a rumor is going around the men that Himmler has abandoned us to our fates, and that he is not aiding us not because of an inability to do so, but because he does not want to help. This rumor is undoubtedly false, and any man caught spreading it has been sentenced to death.\n\nWith or without Himmler intentionally ignoring us, the fact remains that supplies we were banking on are not arriving. Luckily, our scouts and spies has reported that a major Garrison convoy, laden with weapons and bullets, will soon be rolling down the roads of Böhmen-Mähren, directly into our hands. This will be a perfect opportunity to replenish. It is best that we take this chance, on the off chance that Burgundy is never able to aid us."

In the middle of the night, all roads leading into and out of Prague have been cut off or destroyed. The SS now has the jewel of the Garrison directly in its hands, and the traitors are powerless to break free of our iron grip. Even now, they must be wondering where their bread, their ammo, and their communications have gone. A lack of communication leads to panic, confusion, and a lack of food can only amplify this. Now, we close in. It will only take a little more waiting, and the people of Prague will either starve or surrender. With luck, they will turn on each other, and do most of the bloodletting for us. In any case, if they take longer to fall than expected, we have them surrounded. A storming, while one will certainly be painful, is not out of the realm of possibility.\n\nFor now, however, we are content to wait them out. Patience is a virtue, and it is one the SS is not lacking. We waited a decade to rise, we can wait a month for them to fall. All we can do is wait and hope that the head of this gang of snakes, Krosigk, is trapped in there with his band of liberals and cowards."

The flames roar, fast and hot, and they rip apart forests and bushes like a tornado against a wooden shed. Though these infernos serve little practical purpose, their morale effects are incredibly effective. Already, our spies in Prague report a feeling of terror and helplessness within the populace. Desertion from the Guard is at an all time high, and some have our own men have even reported momentarily being intimidated by the sheer spectacle of it all.\n\nOne thing is unquestionable, however: we have pulled off the greatest spectacle Europe has seen since the 50's.

Their hope to escape the massacre was quickly dashed when the SS division taking them in instead gunned them down in the street. This incident would be an omen to the outcome of the battle.\n\nIndeed, to call it a battle would be an overstatement. The Guard and the Garrison were starved, confused, and terrified. The citizens, who had been trained to fight back against the black hordes, instead disappeared into alleys and homes. Quickly, the fighting was pushed back to the City Center, where the Garrison and Guard made a final stand. For a moment, the black wave broke against the concentrated fire. For a moment, there was hope.\n\nAt 1:28pm, the flag of Reichsprotektorat Böhmen-Mähren was shot off the pole of Prague's city center. In its place rose a new flag.

Whatever resistance was left holed up in small towns, futilely attempting to stop the inevitable. In one of these towns, we found the cowardice traitor himself, Krosigk. As expected, the rat was attempting to flee from a doomed town when a sharp-eyed patrol apprehended him. Though it was expected he would put up a fight, he seemingly did nothing as our men seized him, only muttering about his failure. It seems the stress of his defeat has broken him. Though some of our more hot headed soldiers bayed for his blood, he has been thrown into prison for now, to await a trial he rightfully deserves for his crimes against the Aryan people.\n\nIgnoring this, resistance to our rule has been almost wiped out, and any that remains is almost certainly doomed.

This was a battle they must win.\n\nAnd yet, as they came into clear view of the south gate, a strange sight greeted them. The Guardsmen at the gate, armed with rockets and rifles--more than enough to halt the column-- instead dropped their weapons and fled. Confused, yet ecstatic at their easy breaching of the cities defenses, the men poured into the city.\n\nOver the radio, similar reports came from not one, but all other columns. The SS sped down the abandoned streets with absolutely no resistance from the Garrison. The streets were empty, the positions unmanned. Garrison forces, when caught up to, surrendered without a shot. The citizens fled from the advancing columns as they cleared every street, every alley, with not a single bullet flying through the air.\n\nWhen Daluege entered the city, even he expected at least gunfight, one burning tank, one overturned truck. And yet there was nothing. Not a single gunshot made its report as the flag of the Garrison was pulled down and the lion and lightning of the Bohemian SS rose into the sky.\n\nAgainst all odds, the SS had pulled off one of the most incredible steals of all time-- they had taken Prague, not through military might, but through fear.

A curious trend was noticed: each time an engagement with the SS happened, soldiers from both the Guard and the Garrison noted a progressive decrease in the quality of equipment, from the finest black uniforms and FAL's to ragged, ripped uniforms and bolt action rifles. This trend only reinforced the Garrison's resolve.\n\nFinally, after multiple months, the first real offensive has been taken into the countryside. The results are wildly successful. SS troops surrender in droves to our men, only looking for food and water. Daluege himself has been found, passed out drunk, in a nearly empty encampment in the Bohemian Forest. With the SS withered away to the core, all enemy activity has ceased as those who still are loyal to Himmler and Daluege flee into Germany, or simply disappear. Regardless of where these men have gone, the result is clear: the Garrison has persevered, and the people of Bohemia can sigh in relief that they will go to bed with the loving arm of the Protektorat over them."

The men leapt from their vehicles, rushing to the ruined trucks, hoping against hope that the SS had somehow missed the arms.\n\nThey had not.\n\nThe rifles and bullets that were promised to Prague were gone, taken by the dogs of the SS. Schmidt could only bury his head in his hands as the magnitude of the situation hit him. How would the men keep fighting now?"

CZE.36.t:0 "The Battle of Prague"
CZE.36.d:0 "At 12:44 today, the Guard at the western gate of Prague reported a skirmish. At 12:49, this skirmish was seen for what it was--a full blown attack on Prague. At all points of entry to the city, SS tanks and trucks descended like vultures onto our men. These brave soldiers were suddenly confronted with the full might of the SS bearing down on them. In such a terrifying situation, an immediate retreat or rout would not only be a regular, but also entirely reasonable, reaction for the average Czech man.\n\nBut these brave men did not flee, nor did they give up. They picked up their rifles and their rocket launchers, and they threw everything they had at the venomous maniacs that rushed towards them. For 25 precious minutes, this advance force of the Guard, only meant to stop the occasional civilian car or SS skirmishing party, held the entire SS army at every gate until reinforcements arrived.\n\nOnce reinforcements arrived, the battle quickly shifted to a slaughter. The SS forces, as much as they blustered about being superior to the Garrison and Guard, were shattered on the walls of Prague like a wave crashing against rocks. By 1:44, almost all of the SS had fled from the battlefield, leaving hundreds of vehicles and bodies behind them. Unbelievably, the Protektorat has stood up and crushed the lion of the Oberabschnitt.\n\nAlready, massive and raucous celebrations have torn the streets of Prague apart, doing more damage to the city than the SS did. Krosigk has planned to award the Iron Cross, First Class, to any surviving member of those who held the gates alone. Privately, he has already written a speech, to be delivered to whoever is Fuhrer at the end of all this, extolling the virtue and courage of the Czech man. Perhaps this showing of loyalty to the Reich will convince those in Germania that the Czechs should be treated as well as any untermensch can be.\n\nBut these are issues for another time. For now, Prague burns: not under the boots of an invading horde, but under the dancing feet of the citizens who have looked the devil in the face and beaten him."

CZE.40.t:0 "Fortifications In Prague?"
CZE.40.d:0 "Our spies in Prague have submitted their regular reports, and they spell concerning news for our ambitions. According to these reports, the Garrison is beginning to fortify their positions heavily at the entrances to Prague, digging trenches, tank traps, and other positions. Clearly, they've made a correct guess at our intentions. However, these positions are not yet finished, having been started only a few days ago. Daluege now has a few options to take, each of which could spell the end of our campaign.\n\nThe aggressive members of our general staff have recommended an immediate assault on the half-finished positions, attempting to overwhelm them before they can be finished. However, rushing in like this could lead to disaster, and our men may not yet be up for the task.\n\nOur conservative generals recommend to stay with the original plan, continuing our slow demoralization and encircling campaign rather than attempting a full on assault. Of course, this will let the Garrison finish their fortifications, making any attack on Prague significantly tougher.\n\nA third option comes from the more creative members of the Staff- distracting the Garrison with manufactured discontent and rioting in a different city, such as Brno. This will take some time to set up, but may delay their digging in to the point where we can attack without too much trouble. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee of success. If such an action fails, we will have the problem of wasted resources and full defenses.\n\nDaleuge stands at a major crossroads. Whichever way he goes could decide the fate of Böhmen-Mähren."

CZE.41.t:0 "The Brno Riot"
CZE.41.d:0 "They converged in the late hours of the morning. A hundred of them, all SS agents, dressed in their most inconspicuous civilian garb. When the church bells struck 12, they began to loudly march down the streets of Brno, demanding an end to the conflict with a little bit of Czech nationalist symbols and flags mixed in. The hope, of course, was that the citizenry would fall for the bait and join the riot, forcing the Garrison to divert their resources to put down the riot and giving the SS more time.\n\nHowever, the weak point of this plan would show itself early and prevalently-- to start a riot, you need people. Not only did the riot attract almost nobody, but some citizens even started an impromptu counter-protest. Instead of a resounding wave of citizenry, all the so-called rioters got were fists and fury-filled words. When the local police arrived, the men made one more attempt to win favor among the people by charging the outnumbered officers.The crowd's reaction was overwhelmingly negative. By 1, the SS men snuck back into the shadows, and peace and order returned to the streets of Brno. The Brno Riot would disappear from the history books almost as fast as it arrived, and the SS was not only out a few good men and valuable time, but the fortifications were finished in their entirety. This horrific failure would only sink SS morale lower and lower, and even Daluege has to wonder whether the revolution is doomed."

CZE.42.t:0 "The Brno Revolt"
CZE.42.d:0 "They met in the late hours of the morning. A hundred SS men, all in their most inconspicuous garb, with signs and banners above their heads. To an outsider, not in the know about the machinations of the Oberasbchnitt, this congregation looked not like a SS meetup and instead like a pro-peace, pro-Czech independence rally. Perhaps it was a good sign when the meeting's numbers began to swell even before the riot even started.\n\nWhen the clock hit 12, the men began to march. Banners high above their heads, Czech flags flying in the wind, the march quickly grew and spread. By the time the mob reached the center of Brno, their numbers had reached well over 1,000 angry citizens. The police, heavily outnumbered, didn't even try to quell the riot, instead throwing down their shields and batons and heading home, with some even joining the mob. Now completely unchecked, the riot went wild, tearing through the once quiet streets like a tornado. When the local garrison proved unable to stop them, urgent calls for reinforcements were sent to Prague.\n\nIn Prague, the soldiers stopped work on their half-finished trenches and pushed towards Brno as fast as their trucks could carry them. Unfortunately, they were too late to save the mayor and his staff, who, in typical Czech fashion, were thrown from the third floor of his office.\n\nWhen the Garrison finally arrived, the street battle became an actual battle, as SS men started a running gunfight through the streets of Brno. By the time the city finally settled down, over a hundred soldiers and citizens lay dead, with another thousand wounded. The men of the SS snuck out of Brno in the chaos, and returned to Daluege's camp. When Daluege was given the after action report, he looked up and smiled."

CZE.43.d:0 "The generals of the Oberabschnitt bent over a map in the main tent. Outside, men ate their lunch and quietly spoke with each other. Inside, the atmosphere was ready to snap with tension. One officer pushed small metal figurines around a map as Daluege watched, cigarette in hand. \n\n"Spies have reported combined Garrison and Guard movements from all major resistance strongholds-." He paused to push multiple figurines out of their respective cities and into the countryside. "-these units appear to be attacking in all directions, reclaiming captured towns. Our men are fighting, but they're outmatched and heavily outnumbered. These Garrison forces seem to be focusing on resource centers and roads, evidently trying to cut off whatever supplies we have while the Guard mops up whatever's left."\n\nHe turned to Daluege.\n\n"The other men and I have convened and checked our supplies. We estimate that we have, factoring in rationing and resource conservation, about 30 days from now until our position becomes entirely untenable."\n\nDaleuge said nothing. His fellow generals all turned to him, waiting for an order. For a moment, one could almost see the various thoughts and emotions whirling inside his head. \n\nFinally, his head snapped up, staring right back at his officers. They needed a man to lead them through this dark time, and Daluege had to be that man. Loudly, he gave his final statement."

CZE.44.t:0 "White Rag Over The Black Sun"
CZE.44.d:0 "Gunfire crackled through the Bohemian forest. In the main camp of the SS-Oberaschnitt, panicked men rushed from tent to tent. Some men loitered around an exit nervously, before running out when the guards there were distracted. A quick burst of gunfire from a nearby watchtower signalled their fate.\n\nHowever, inside of the command tent, all was calm. Daluege sat alone at his table, maps and figurines splayed out across the table. The map, now left abandoned, showed a ring of Garrison troops surrounding the Bohemian Forest, and with it the head base of the SS. An artillery shell detonated nearby, and the figurines were rattled off the table, clattering on the floor. Daluege did not move to pick them up; there was no need.\n\nOutside, the noises of war grew louder and louder. Slowly but surely, the SS was being forced back. Daluege looked over at the Luger on his desk. It was truly a tempting thought to take that Luger and splatter his brains across the wall. Daluege forced these thoughts away. He would not die at his own hand, like a coward. Instead, he stepped out of his tent and made his way to the nearest watchtower, white rag in hand. As he marched through the camp, his inner thoughts seethed at those who had betrayed him- the men in Germania, Krosigk, his own soldiers, and that treacherous fool Himmler, who had seen the greatest chance the Reich had to form a true Aryan paradise and let it slip without a second thought. With just a few planes, a few air drops, perhaps the SS would have had the resources to shatter the traitors of the Garrison.\n\nIt didn't matter now. As he reached the top of the watchtower, he stepped over a sniper's corpse. The man, who couldn't be older than 25, had blood and brains seeping through his blonde hair. The rage in Daluege only intensified. How many Aryans, true sons of Germany, had died because of Himmler's ignorance and Krosigk's treachery? This thought pounded away at Daluege's head as he furiously waved the white rag, and slowly the gunfire quieted as the soldiers learned of the surrender.\n\nDaleuge looked down upon the men he had entrusted the capture of the Protektorat to. Some looked relieved, some angry, some blank. All would undoubtedly be arrested, including Daluege. Indeed, there was quite a good chance that Daluege would be executed anyway. He didn't care. All he cared about now was to not let any more of the Reich's chosen son's die for a man who did not care about them. He would not play Himmler's game."

CZE.45.t:0 "Krosigk's Last Stand"
CZE.45.d:0 "It was an entirely average day in Prague. Smoke from the fires set by SS troops still hung low over the city, and people rushed to and fro, from market to market, trying to find whatever food was left. Krosigk knew the truth about that one. Prague was down to its last legs when it came to food. Even government officials were on starvation rations now. Sighing, he weakly sat down in his chair, reading the papers that came to him. Standard reports from the Guard, reporting desertions and problems, an increasingly frightening report from the Garrison itself detailing the state of defenses-\n\nA noise turned Krosigk's attention to the window. A crowd of people tore down the street in front of his office, running from something. Confused, Krosigk grabbed his coat and his papers, in case one of the many fires outside Prague had reached the city itself.\n\nThe threat was much worse than that.\n\nKrosigk watched incredulously as a tank, painted black with white lightning, rounded the corner. Behind it was a stream of heavily armed infantry, all dressed in black. Krosigk knew who they were before they even came close enough for him to discern the lightning on their helmets.\n\nIn a flash, he tore out the door, rushing for his Volkswagen. Leaping in, he started the car ferociously, and sped out of his garage onto a back alley. Swerving around fleeing citizens, he raced for a small exit that he prayed the ss had overlooked.\n\nAt this exit, only a few SS remained on guard, the rest having gone to loot the city or partake in the glory of the conquest. Krosigk's car tore by them before they even had a chance to fire.\n\nAs Krosigk roared down the remains of the Protektorat's road system, he did not have a plan. He only had one thought he could focus on."

CZE.46.t:0 "The Lidice Massacre"
CZE.46.d:0 "The convoy trundled to a halt in front of the embattled town of Lidice. It seemed to stay still for a moment in time, taking in the destruction and death that had been spewed across the roads. Men peered over the cab of trucks and out of the hatches of their armored cars with a mixture of shock, disgust, and fear. Soldiers gripped their rifles tighter and slowly dismounted.\n\nThe scene was one of utter brutality and depravity. Dead men, women, and children lined the roads, their faces masks of terror. Buildings sagged or lay collapsed, their exteriors blackened and charred by fire. Vehicles lay as skeletal, burnt out husks.\n\nThe soldiers slowly combed through the ruins, searching for any life. There was none. Everything was dead, from people to pets to farm animals. It had all been riddled with bullets.\n\nSpeculation ran rife through the men, as the suspected culprits-those damn partisans-had never done something this brutal, this efficient, this clean. With every atrocity and every murder they found, a quiet voice in the back of every man's head grew louder and louder. An impossible truth crystallized, one so horrific that the men almost refused to believe it.\n\nAnd then Gefreiter Von Schweck found something.\n\nIn a collapsed barn on the far edge of town, a dead Czech peasant leaned against the wall with an empty shotgun in hand. Ignoring the fact that this shotgun was technically illegal, the much more interesting part lay dead in front of the man, shot twice in the chest.\n\nAn SS officer."

CZE.47.t:0 "The SS Take The Stand"
CZE.47.d:0 "The TV cameras whirred to life as the Prague Trials began. These trials could only be truly placed in quotation marks, because they were not trials. Instead, they were a nationally televised broadcast of revenge. The defendants, the highest ups of the Oberaschnitt, were not granted lawyers, as if any would have taken them on. Even if they had the finest lawyers in the Protektorat, there would have been no use for them, for the defendants were barely given any time to defend themselves. Indeed, this was less of a trial and more of a session in which the fury of the Czech people crashed down on the SS.\n\nEach man took the stand at a differing point, and each man was crushed under the weight of over a dozen charges, ranging from treason to murder to tax evasion. Each man was forced to watch as crying widows shouted about their crimes against the German people, or as soldiers described, in full detail, how these men had personally executed their friends. It was a moral bloodbath.\n\nThe most interesting of these trials was Kurt Daluege's trial. Once a proud leader of the SS, he now used his time on the stand to rant and rave about how Himmler had betrayed him and the aryans of the Protektorat, up to him publicly resigning from the SS. Whether this was indicative of his true feelings, or just a ploy to get off with a lighter sentence, is not known. Either way, the outcome was the same.\n\nThe 12 men were each sentenced to death, effective immediately. They were quickly dragged outside of the courthouse and, in front of dozens of cameras, executed by firing squad. With their death goes the head of the snake, and now the people of Böhmen-Mähren can rest easy knowing that the terror is finally over."

CZE.48.t:0 "Summary Punishment"
CZE.48.d:0 "The forest echoed with gunshot after gunshot. SS man ran through the trees like ants, dragging Garrison and Guard prisoners behind them to the nearest tree. One of these squads, however, was much different from the rest. Kurt Daluege walked in front of his men. Behind him, in chains, staggered Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk. The proud man's suit was ripped and torn, and his face sported a number of bruises and cuts from his imprisonment. When he started to lag behind, a SS soldier was always there to smack him with a pistol and keep him moving.\n\nFinally, the party reached a large tree to use. The trunk was already riddled with blood and bullet holes, and the corpses of the executed lay haphazardly to the side in a hastily dug ditch. Carefully, Krosigk was tied to the tree. He gave no resistance. Perhaps he didn't see the point. Perhaps he was too exhausted, mentally and physically, to fight back. Either way, the men finished up and stepped back. Daluege turned to face Krosigk, and for the first time in months, the men came face to face. They needed no words to express the animosity between them. Daluege gave Krosigk a parting punch in the face before walking back to his men. Wordlessly, the men raised their rifles. Daluege aimed his pistol slowly and gave the order.\n\nA sharp crack echoed through the forest and quickly faded into the other gunshots. Krosigk slumped over, dead on his feet. Quickly, the men cut the ropes and pushed him into the ditch, before speedily filling in the grave. They worked into the night, with more and more SS men dropping their rifles and grabbing shovels, digging graves for the thousands of dead.\n\nWhen morning came, the only sign that a bloodbath had ever taken place were the bloodstains, the bullet holes, and the raised earth."

In the middle of the night, doors were kicked down and homes were raided. Every weapon and every bullet the SS found, they confiscated. Secret supply caches, left behind in the surrender, were weeded out with dogs and raided. Finally, the few bastions of Garrison resistance that were left were attacked. Whatever soldier found in these camps first had their uniforms and weapons taken, their tents raided for anything of value, and finally were marched off behind whatever building was nearby and shot to ribbons.\n\nBy the end of the night, the SS had come up with a hefty sum of weapons, bullets, grenades, and shells. With these supplies being added to the stockpile, it seemed that the Oberabschnitt was ready for any fool who dared attack them. With experienced, equipped troops, some generals estimated that the SS could hold out for months against the weight of the full Wehrmacht. While these numbers may have been somewhat overexaggerated to please Daluege, there is no question that the Oberabschnitt is as ready as it ever will be for an invasion."

It seems that the new Reichsprotektor, former Finance Minister Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, has been much more liberal with his reforms than expected. As detailed in a long letter from the conservative wing of the party in the Protektorat, Krosigk has made multiple moves to allow the natives freedom after freedom, up to and including relaxing our laws that keep them down! None of these changes were noted in any of their policy change letters, which has thrown the Reichstag into a flurry of anger and confusion. Bormannites, Göringites, and the few Heydrichites have all agreed that these changes must be reversed as quickly as possible if the safety and stability of the Protektorat is to be kept. Speer's faction is the sole faction in the Reichstag to argue in favor of these reforms, as they are very similar to Speer's own goals. While Hitler has forbidden any more action against the unruly Reichsprotektor than a simple slapdown of these policies, Speer himself has come out in support of these measures.
