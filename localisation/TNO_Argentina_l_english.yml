 Agustin_Penas_hog_desc: "------------\n§LThe Chief of Naval Operations has reached his position after a long life of service and study in the Argentinian Navy. \n\nThe Tyrant did not impede his career until the last moments, when he was arrested. Yet this state of affairs did not last long, for the Revolución Libertadora saw him freed and promoted to Rear Admiral. \n\n Frondizi's failure to purge the influence of the Partido Justicialista made him the first to plot his overthrowing. \n\n Now that Frondizi has fallen, his efforts have seen him reach a position of great influence in the Régimen de Reconstrucción Nacional.§!"
 ARG_Juan_Carlos_Lorio_sec: "후안 카를로스 로리오"
 Juan_Carlos_Lorio_sec_desc: "------------\n§LGeneral Lorio is an Infantry officer with a rather irregular service. \n\nHe did not hold many commands during his career, being a professor in the Escuela Superior de Guerra during the Tyrant's regime. When he fell, he proved reticent to execute those members of the Army who rebelled against the Revolución LIbertadora, which did not help his military career. \n\n His return to service as Commander of the Army happened due to his relation with General Poggi. Many things can be said about the new President of Argentina: But that he does not understand the need to have powerful friends around him is not one of them.§!"

 Ortiz_Rozas_for_desc: "------------\n§LIt is somewhat ironic that the descendant of the first Tyrant of Argentina may now be the Minister of Foreign Relations in a government born to combat the influence of it's second Tyrant. \n\nEven then, nobody can deny that his experience abroad, even during Frondizi's tenure, and his ample network of contacts has allowed him to keep himself relevant in the turbulent political life of Argentina. \n\n The new regime has few friends, and General Poggi knows very well that keeping some stability, even more so if it comes with a renowned face internationally, can only help him fulfill his goals.§!"

 Roberto_Alemann_eco_desc: "------------\n§LRoberto Alemann is the poor man who received the "honor" of being the Economy Ministry of an Argentina that is economically devastated by decades of mismanagement, first under the Tyrant, then under Frondizi. \n\n In a country where the Economy Minister exists only to extract resources for the president to spend at his leisure, Alemann has the sad task of trying to draw water from the sand to fulfill General Poggi's wishes. \n\n Maybe, if he is fortunate, he will even make it happen.§!"

 POLITICS_AF_DESC: "If you talked to Arturo Frondizi and asked him what he represented, he would without a heartbeat reply “The Radical Legacy”. If you asked his opponents, or even some of his cynical supporters, they would say he indeeds represents the legacy of the Radicals: economic collapse, personality politics and extreme weakness.\n\nFirst identifying with Yrigoyenismo as an apolitical youth, Arturo Frondizi emerged from law school an opponent to tyranny. After being arrested again in 1932, he joined the Radical Civic Union. In the UCR, he advocated for an anti-fascist foreign policy, contrary to Argentina’s traditional neutrality. After being elected as a national deputy, in the great battle over Perón’s reforms to labor unions Frondizi  was one of the few to chart a course between tepid support and radical opposition to Peron's agenda.\n\nIn 1952, Arturo Frondizi was nominated as vice president to Ricardo Balbín, but their infighting doomed a valiant effort against the Peronist tide. When the Colonel proved himself a Tyrant, Frondizi supported the effort to oust him. Frondizi proceeded to outmaneuver both Balbin and the military regime in his presidential bid of 1958. Making use of Peron's popularity, Frondizi made a deal with the Justicialist party to clinch victory.\n\nNow, however, Frondizi finds himself at the head of a fractured party. Outside of the leading coalition, the increasingly divided army is losing patience with its radically moderate president. Beyond that, the people of Argentina despair over the stagnating economy. Most wonder if anyone, let alone Frondizi, can keep Argentina together at all."
 POLITICS_PEA_DESC: "Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, truly a controversial figure in Argentine political history. Born in 1903 to a humble farmer family in a small cottage-turned village named Rio Cuarto, his natural aptitude for leadership and strong-arming would quickly point the young man towards the Military Academy. It wouldn’t take long for his charismatic self to insert itself into the inner machinations and complex mechanisms of the military, quickly rising through the ranks due to his appeasing yet staunch stance on his views, namely Anti-Peronism, many shared a similar hatred of the revolutionary zeal that the once-general deposited into the lowly masses, seen as not much more than a populist degenerate, Pedro exploited this relation to the maximum, with ample success. Already becoming a well-respected and known figure by 1954, as his general rank would denote, Aramburu had successfully webbed himself into the trappings of Argentine politics, no institution had as much interest in the hell that was the constantly developing Platense public affairs as the soldierly, that with all the tumultuous problems faced by the country ever since the rise in popularity of a certain general. And Aramburu knew this, he knew it very well, and his knowledge would culminate in the Magnus opus of his life’s work, the Revolucion Libertadora. \n\n A bleak September day of 1956, he remembered it clearly, a shot to the temple of the commanding officer in an artillery school, sublevations across the provinces, a blockade of the main national port of the navy. But the worst thing of all: the unbearable pain on his right leg when a treacherous enemy bullet reached him. Still, a sense of proudness overcame him that day, the day that the despicable fascists at the helm of the nation would be swayed away, and a new era of national revitalization would commence. But that wasn’t going to be the case. Admiral Rojas tried everything he could to eliminate the fascist cancer from the nation, but internal betrayal would be the downfall of his regime. It didn’t matter how strict the ban on Peronist nomenclature was or how many subversives were arrested: the Deposed Tyrant found a way to still attack the nation, even if he was far away in self-exile. This would, much to his distaste, result in the 1958 Constituent Assembly elections, bringing into power the ‘UCR’ candidate Frondizi, but Aramburu knew he was a crypto-Peronist, they were all crypto Peronists, nowhere was safe from the scourge that they brought. \n\n Now, thanks to his newly-formed UDELPA faction, Aramburu has managed to get a hold into power- and by democratic means no less. No matter how many fraudulent idiots like those in the academy or false democrats in the UCR he had to go through, he would save the nation, and the only way to do it is to eliminate the parasitic web of lies that have been holding the country back. The trade-unions will be crushed, the ineffective bureaucracy eliminated, and the intrusive state structure completely reformed for a new era. Nothing will remain from the failed fascist experiment."
 POLITICS_JCO_DESC: "Lieutenant General Juan Carlos Onganía is a very strange creature among the Argentinian high command: A man who is extremely capable at his job, and one who has reached his position without help nor opposition from the military or civilian power players.\n\nAlthough an extremely conservative and very religious man, he understands the need to cooperate with the more liberal sectors of society in order to rebuild Argentina and push it away from the more nefarious aspects of the Tyrant's ideology. It is well known that he has the sympathy of the Church, large sectors of the Armed Forces and even of the citizenry and business sectors. Even the more moderate members of the Tyrant's hosts speak with Onganía, although to what degree the General is willing to accept the return of the Tyrant is only he knows for sure.\n\nThe astute observer could say that the greatest threat Onganía will face in his mission to prevent the collapse of Argentina is overestimating is own extensive capabilities, and trying to bite more than he can chew. He would not be the first Argentinian to lose it all at the hands of his hubris, for that is the story of Argentina herself."
 POLITICS_RAP_DESC: "Being one of the oldest generals in the Argentinian High Command, Raúl Alejandro Poggi has seen it all and been part of very little. \n\n His lack of ideological alignment with the Tyrant during his regime saw him sidelined until it's fall, it was then his belonging to the Engineer Corps in a High Command controleld by the Cavalry Corps what left him outside the inner circle of power. Despite his relatively ordinary career, the General has his own political interests and aspirations. \n\n His arrival to the high spheres of power took place shortly before the start of the Frondizi presidency, with his promotion to Brigadier General. Since then, he has managed to use his conections to reach an unusual degree of power over the Argentinian Armed Forces and politics; Power that he aims to use to ensure the Tyrant's influence over Argentina is utterly purged and, maybe, even take him to Rivadavia's Chair along the way. \n\n Mayhap a man desperately opposed to fascism is exactly what Argentina needs to leave behind the darkest times in it's history, but rumors of his mental instability and chemical dependency have only increased, and his lack of pragmatism and ability to come to understandings may cost him his power and goals."
 POLITICS_JLR_DESC: "Many things could be said of Dr. José Luis Romero, a con-man, a dirty communist, a bleeding-heart progressive, but if he had to choose one thing that he was sure he wasn’t, it would be yet another fascist apologist. Having been a respected historian during his years tutoring the young students of the University of La Plata, that cozy spot of his would soon be thrown away due to his rather passionate views on what a certain Italian-inmigrant leader was doing with the direction of the country. His mouth would earn Mr. Romero a one-way trip to a self-exile in the neighboring nation of Uruguay, where he would remain all the way from 1945 to 1956, the year that ‘democracy’ finally returned to Argentina. \n\n As he stepped into the familiar bustle and muster of the capital port, he had to make a choice, either to continue his passive resistance to that wicked pseudo-populist ideology or take a more active approach. He was no stranger to the Partido Socialista, being a socialist himself and an active one at that, but he had never truly considered a career in politics. This all would change, however, as opportunities sprung up, deals here, some alleyway conversations there, many of his former students were important members in the party as well -- All of this netted him the chance to run as the Vice presidential candidate alongside Alfredo Palacios in the 1958 elections, against the blabbermouth of Balbin and the Peronist sympathizer of Frondizi. \n\n Of course, they didn’t get elected. And now, 4 years later, with the looming threat of the Tyrant on the horizon, the doubtful future of the Radicalist party, and the ever-watchful eye of the military, Romero will have to balance the odds into his favor, to even have a chance in maintaining this territory together."
 POLITICS_BALBIN_DESC: "Ricardo Balbin's life has been a crushingly depressing cycle of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nOnce a brilliant medicine student, he was forced to end his studies due to financial constraints. Only after working minor jobs for the Union Civica Radical was he able to return to university to become a lawyer. In the same year, he played a major role in the electoral campaign of Hipolito Yrigoyen, ensuring his appointment as district attorney of Mendoza, but he lost his job shortly afterwards when Yrigoyen was overthrown in a coup. In the subsequent elections, he was elected a national deputy, but never took office as the results were annulled. Ten years later, he was elected again but forced to resign alongside the rest of his party as a protest against the fraudulent presidential elections.\n\nAfter the election of Juan Peron in 1946, Balbin was arrested thrice for standing in opposition to the regime, and went through the increasingly humiliating cycle of being the UCR's official candidate in provincial and presidential elections the outcomes of which the Peronist party had already determined. With Peron's overthrow in 1956, Balbin, who for a decade had carried out the democratic resistance to his rule, saw his chance to enter the race as the undisputed candidate of the UCR. However, he was once more forced to stand for an election which he had no hope of winning by Arturo Frondizi's "secret" pact with Peron's supporters. Cheated out the nomination, Balbin resolved never to be betrayed again, and for the next six years, worked to ensure Frondizi would have to select him.\n\nAlthough it took a compromise on the choice of his economic policy, it now looks as if the Balbin curse has finally been lifted. Hardly able to believe it himself, Balbin relishes in his work finally being recognized by what he has always wanted: Being the democratically elected president."
 POLITICS_FRAMINI_DESC: "Andrés Framini was born mere days after the opening shots of the First World War. In 1930 he began working as a laborer for a textile company, and during the Revolución del 43 he too joined the cohors of the union movement.\nHe was present the 17th of October of 1945, and from that day onwards he'd remain loyal to Juan Domingo Perón, although largely beneath his notice for most of his presidency, until he took over his union in 1953.\n\nOnce Perón fled the country after the Revolución Libertadora, Framini became one of the primary figures of the Resistencia Peronista. Since then he worked tirelessly to organize the underground Peronist movement into a cohesive force capable of exerting it's influence and, hopefully, bring the movement back into power. The weakness of the Frondizi government, exacerbated in no small part by the efforts of Framini and other union bosses, and consequent failures in economy and policy both internal and external allowed resentment and despair to fester across the country. \nThis despair has had the desired effect. Many in Argentina believe that only the Peronistas can bring the nation back from the brink of the abyss, enough to grant Framini an electoral victory ample enough that the UCR and the Armed Forces have been forced to acknowledge it.\n\nNow the only question is whether Framini will live up to the expectations of the movement, and bring back Juan Domingo Perón. None can tell to what degree the old general will hold sway over the government, but many are torn between the fear that he will be the power behind the throne and the hope that Framini will be a more moderate figure who will not allow the barbarity and brutality of the past to be reenacted with the renewed fury of the vengeful."
 POLITICS_ILLIA_DESC: "While countless members of the Unión Cívica Radical protest admiration for the legacy of the great Hipolito Yrigoyen based on an idealized portrait, Arturo Humberto Illia has something more to go off of, having met the man almost all liberals in Argentina revere personally in 1930. At that time, the then-president entrusted Illia with the job of doctor for the Pergamino railway station and the surrounding lands. He has puttered away at that humble work ever since, serving everyone from clerks and children to parsons and policemen, always speaking kindly to his patients in his Córdoba accent. \n\nDespite his dedication to his work, he managed to find time to involve himself in politics. Except for one brief time spent as Vice-Governor of his native Córdoba, Arturo Illia's career has been mostly centered around the complexities and petty squabbles that define the politics of Buenos Aires. It is in this role that he was able to rise through the ranks of the UCR while Argentina teetered on the edge of one or another form of tyranny through the last twenty years. \nIllia's appointment to the presidency surprised many people, him most of all. The humble doctor asked around and found that he had been selected as a compromise between Ricardo Balbín and Arturo Frondizi to mend the Intransigente-Pueblo divide in their party. Furthermore, Illia was told, Balbín believed that Illia would be best suited to handle the demands of the military that he knew would be coming. When Illia was told all this, he merely bowed his head and made ready to serve the people of Argentina just as he served the people at the railway station. \n\nThe new president has the appearance and demeanour of a wholesome, inoffensive old man, and he is indeed wholesome and inoffensive. But behind those kind externalities there is a man devoted to his principles. Doctor Arturo Humberto Illia is above all a man who believes in democracy and compromise; he will not abandon these noble concepts, nor will he turn his face away from the people he serves without very good reason."
 POLITICS_FRIGERIO_DESC: "If one were to look at Rogelio Julio Frigerio, one would find a member of that strange breed of politician that started off as a practitioner of some extreme ideology before trending towards the centre. In university during the 1930s, he was a communist, before dismissing communism as an elitist ideology without much care for the people.\n\nLater on, he became an economic nationalist and an advocate of developmentalism; this attracted him towards Arturo Frondizi's faction of the Unión Cívica Radical, though strangely enough he did not get a membership card until rather recently. It was in this position that he was able to leverage his competence as an economist by profession to use in order to serve his beloved country.\n\nWhile by no means immune to criticism, Frigerio has somehow done the impossible, surviving as the Argentine Minister of Finance for all six years of a duly elected government. This record, combined with his prior fame as an outsider and an intellectual, helped him secure the UCR's nomination against the favored candidate, Dr Arturo Illia. Being forced to share space with the MID's leader, Oscar Alende, as well as figures from Balbín's faction of the UCR, will certainly prove something of a challenge for Frigerio in his aim to create a technocratic and intellectual government for the Republic of Argentina."

 ARG_peronist_resistance: "페론주의자 저항"
 ARG_peronist_resistance_desc: "The particularly repressive actions of the Menendez dictatorship turned the decline of Peronism into a rebirth:  Walk-outs, strikes, protests, and the occasional bombings have become everyday occurrences in an Argentina without Peron. The proscription of the Justicialist Party is not stopping dozens of other parties running on its behalf. Despite President Frondizi's more conciliatory attitude, it is clear this subversion is not stopping any time soon. From his exile in Iberia, Peron continues to try to egg on the disturbances through nefarious means, including those of his personal Representative, John. W Cooke. If this is not adressed, the Resistance could make the job of governing Argentina virtually impossible.\n\n§REven worse, Peron himself could take advantage of the situation to get back into the country...§!"

 ARG_azules_and_colorados: "분열된 육군"
 ARG_azules_and_colorados_desc: "Army factionalism is not a new thing, but it seldom reaches levels as explosive as those of Argentina. Following the end of the short-lived Lonardi presidency at the hands of the most liberal, anti-peronists sectors of the armed forces, the Argentine military has been increasingly split into two camps: Blues and Reds. \n\nThe Azules seek to maintain and deepen Argentina’s status as an observer in the Triumvirate, ensure the "domestication" of peronism by separating it from its leader, and to ultimately depoliticize the armed forces, while allowing for Constitutional continuity of the civilian government. On the other hand, the OFN-aligned Colorados see peronism as a fascist movement, and a possible conduit towards communism. Their inmidaite goal, it appears, is to instate an indefinitely long military dictatorship, and use the apparatus of the state to quash Peronism once and for all. \n\nIn their struggle for total control over the FAA, the victim is usually Frondizi's administration, which has been subject to over 50 humilliating §Rplanteos militares§!, which force him and his government to change policy at the whims of specific officer, threatening perpetual §RAcuartelamientos§! as preludes to coup'd etats."

 ARG_anti_americanism: "반미주의"
 ARG_anti_americanism_desc: "The unashamedly pro-Axis government of the 4th of June Revolution met an inglorious end at the hands of general Alvaro Eduardo Avalos, in 1945. The resultant election gave a narrow triumph to the sycophantically Anglophile Unionist government of 1946-1952, whose deference to America created a lasting resentment. \n\nAfter his own election in 1952, Peron thought that he could be on good terms with both the USA and the Triumvirate, which he joined as an observer. He was wrong: Abandoning the OFN's trade embargo was seen as an attempt to increase German influence in South America. This led to a series of policies, which when combined with the arrogant behavior of ambassador Spruille Braden, that only worsened popular perceptions of the United States. \n\nThe population didn't take this foreign meddling too well. From college students burning American flags outside the embassy to officers receiving mysterious foreign phone calls, a good chunk of the population - including much of the army - hates anything with Stars and Stripes. This has made it harder for politicans to openly advocate for closer relations with the OFN."

 ARG_economic_woes: "La Malaria"
 ARG_economic_woes_desc: "Once a shining light of growth and progress, Argentina has fallen on hard times. Since 1943, growth has slumped, inflation soared, and slums multiplied. The central question which Argentine governments now face is how to adress and reverse this decline, which has been popularly termed La Malaria. \n\nAt present, the Frondizite economic "developmentalist scheme" necessitates massive amounts of foreign capital to invest in the country, as well as an unprecedented volume of capital-good imports, in order to meet the demand for the flourishing new industries. This has, in turn, caused runaway inflation, which has further difficulted the overbearingly difficult relationship of the market economy with the large trade-unions, the CGT (Confederacion General del Trabajo) in particular. If not managed correctly, these difficulties could bring Frondizi's project to an ignominious end."
