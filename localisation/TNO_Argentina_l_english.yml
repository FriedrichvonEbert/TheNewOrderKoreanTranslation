 ARG_Alfredo_Roque_Vitolo_hog: "Alfredo Roque Vitolo"
 ARG_Alfredo_Roque_Vitolo_hog_desc: "------------\n§LAlfredo Roque Vitolo was originally a "Lencinist" Radical, named after the leftist Mendozine caudillo that led the province's UCR in the 1920s. When Lencinas' splinter declined after his assasination by rival Radicals, Vitolo pledged his allegiance to the UCR's National Committee, earning him a quick promotion to head the Mendoza Radical Party, and a brief spell in Congress before the June 1943 Coup that engendered Peronism.\n\nWhen Frondizi split the UCR in 1958, Vitolo once again chose to stay with the winning side, and joined the "Intransigeants," although he lost primary elections to become governor of Mendoza. As a consolation prize, he was awarded the interior ministry - in charge of police forces and micro-management of political affairs - in which he has proved surprisingly long-lived, being the only minister from the original Frondizi cabinet still in office.§!"
 ARG_Miguel_Carcano_for: "Miguel Ángel Cárcano"
 ARG_Miguel_Carcano_for_desc: "------------\n§LMiguel Cárcano is the son of fellow conservative Córdoba Governor Ramón José Cárcano, an 1890s Cabinet Minister and one of a number of conservatives who supported Peronism. While he was twice elected a deputy for the Conservatives in the 1930s, and remains a member of the PD, Cárcano has put his diplomatic career above party affiliation.\n\nServing as ambassador to France, Britain, and the United States throughout the Second World War, Carcano struck a close friendship with Joseph Kennedy and his family. This proved the major factor behind his appointment as foreign minister following the ouster of Frigerio's collaborators under military pressure.§!"
 ARG_Alvaro_Alsogaray_eco: "Álvaro Carlos Alsogaray"
 ARG_Alvaro_Alsogaray_eco_desc: "------------\n§LLike many of the Generals that plot to overthrow Frondizi, Alvaro Alsogaray had his political debut as a cadet in the overthrowing of Hipolito Yrigoyen, Frondizi's one time personal hero. Unlike his fellow officers, however, "El Ingeniero" Alsogaray retired as a captain to focus on his increasing affection for free market economics.\n\nWhile his views are quite out of step with popular sentiment - even in the most conservative sectors - and his Partido Civico Independiente remains miniscule, his connections with the military have earned him several ministerial posts, as head of Commerce (1956-58) and now minister of Economics. It would seem as if his choice was encouraged by Rogelio Frigerio - the man whom he de facto replaced - who viewed him as a useful figure to controlled inflation while paying attention to the desarollist projects he initiated. To Frondizi's dismay, he's largely defrauded this promise, and his connections with the military make him very hard to replace.§!"
 ARG_Rosendo_Fraga_sec: "Rosendo Fraga"
 ARG_Rosendo_Fraga_sec_desc: "------------\n§LGeneral Rosendo Fraga comes from a family deeply steeped in the Argentine military's greatest tradition - plotting - and like his father before him, he has reached the "political" leadership of the Army as Secretario de Guerra (Minister of War). While Rosendo - whose grandfather, father, and son share the same name - repeatedly plotted against Frondizi repeatedly as Commander of the IV Division in Cordoba, since his elevation to the cabinet - produced under pressure from General Toranzo-Montero - he has changed his mind and become an ardent loyalist.\n\nFraga a self described "conservative of liberal", has slowly but surely built up distrust against his former ally, Toranzo-Montero and his closest supporters within the army. His success, aided by his approachable personality and personal prestige, will certainly prove vital for Frondizi's survival.§!"

Martinez to the deputy position in the ministry responsible for micro-managing political affairs and the police, Grondona, a catholic and recently moderated anti peronist, has the task of ensuring the political factions within the Front don't collapse, and of keeping the political ambitions of Peronism contained. His main enemy in this task is his extremely limited number of personal connections, a by-product of his youth and recent entry into politics.§!"
 ARG_Mario_Amadeo_for_desc: "------------\n§LOn the saner side of the spectrum of Argentine Nacionalismo lies the group revolving around Dr. Mario Amadeo French, a lawyer with immense prestige. A seasoned Amadeo, a seasoned diplomat with a small role in mediating armistices at the end of WW2, occupied the foreign ministry in Lonardi's government, and later bewildered many of his far right friends by throwing in his considerable intellectual and personal resources at the disposition of Frondizi in 1958.\n\nThese Frondizist connections gave the nationalists what they never had obtained by other means: Electoral Relevance, and assured control of Foreign Affairs. Unlike other, more egomaniacal nationalists, Amadeo knows to quit while ahead, and has little incentive to do anything but try and maintain the Frente Nacional as it is, at least not unless he has sufficient assurances that any alterations will guarantee the Nacionalista's newly accrued power.§!"
 ARG_Juan_E_Guglialmelli_eco_desc: "------------\n§LFor many in the Army, the name of Arturo Frondizi sparked fear, almost terror, in 1958. For "J.E.G.'' However, the Desarollist President was a blessing, both politically and for his career. Guglialmelli, adherent to Frondizi's ideas and perhaps the most brilliant and intellectual man in the army, became a prolific writer in defense of the government's economic goals, which only strengthened his personal friendship with Frondizi.\n\nAfter his prolific role as a leading Azul during the war between Army factions in 1962-63, Guglialmelli was promoted to General, and, with the advent of the Frente Nacional, guaranteed the direction of economic policy, with the agreement of both Frondizi and Frigerio. While nominally heading the planning - rather than economics - ministry, it is he who controls the direction of the economy, the basis of which are his new §CPlanes de Desarollo§!."
 ARG_Juan_C_Rosas_sec_desc: "------------\nThe 'red general' of the Army, Juan Carlos Rosas forms the most visible head of the 'sundrahists,' a group of officers identified with the nationalism of the Azad Hind and its leader. Sometimes accused of "marxism" on account of this, he is nothing of the sort, but remains far more tolerant of left wing 'socializing' measures than other generals.\n\nThis tolerance, and his strident legalism, has made the obvious candidate to tolerate the current government.§!"

 ARG_Juan_Palmero_hog_desc: "------------\n§LJuan Severino Palmero is as loyal as a UCRP member to President Illia. A fellow member of the 'Cordoba Line,' and head of the intervened provincial government during the Hartung government, Palermo is entrusted with the difficult task of avoiding Iillia's ouster by means of smartly letting off the pressure valve represented by the continuous ban on Peronism.\n\nUnfortunately for the government, Palermo is probably not the right man for the job. Not particularly talented or well-liked, his appointed corresponds mostly to his position within the Cordoba UCR.§!"
 ARG_Miguel_Angel_Zavala_Ortiz_for_desc: "------------\n§LOnce the king of Gorillas, Miguel Angel Zavala Ortiz has softened his position on Peronism over the past few years, alongside with his group of 'moderate' unionists. Snuffed out of his preferred post as minister of economy by Illia's insistence of balancing UCR factions, Zavala Ortiz ended up in the foreign ministry.\n\nSomewhat more dangerously pro-United States than both the country and President Illia, Zavala-Ortiz has had his authority undercut by Illia himself, who views his ministers as having mostly, 'advisory' roles.§!"
 ARG_Juan_Carlos_Pugliese_eco_desc: "------------\n§LJuan Carlos Pugliese is a very rare example in Argentine politics of an ordinary party-politician. A Radical since his youth, he occupied a variety of posts, working up the ranks of the UCR itself, before specializing as a man of the legislature, first as an elected senator for his native Buenos Aires and then a national deputy. With nothing particularly special - no family connections, no military friends, no esoteric ideas about economic growth - Pugliese stood out in the UCR just for being normal.\n\nPugliese's stay in the realm of normalcy came to an end however, when he became known as the "substitute minister of all Radical governments." Called away somewhat unwillingly to replace Sussini in Justice after his fall from grace, Pugliese fancied a return to the legislature when Eugenio Blanco, Arturo Illia's main economic advisor, died in the middle of a campaign Speech. Chosen to replace him, Pugliese resigned himself to the task of carrying out a moderately progressive and protectionist Keynesian economic program, which has won him surprisingly few personal enemies in the hectic world of Argentine politics.§!"
 ARG_Ignacio_Avalos_sec_desc: "------------\n§LUnlike what many in the general public believe, the bulk of the Army officers with developed political opinions are moderate Radicals. Ignacio Ávalos is, amongst the sea of these men, one of the most average.\n\nThe general staff officer was retired for being on the losing side of a planteo in 1957, and was thus immune to the events that came afterwards. Combined with his known affiliation with the UCRP, he proved tolerable to General Onganía, who especially liked the fact he was a retired officer.§!"

 ARG_Pablo_Gonzales_Berges_hog_desc: "------------\n§LPablo González Bergez is both Hardoy's right hand man and his right wing. González Bergez is a far more 'gorila' figure than the President, had Colorado leanings which provoke negative feelings in the military, canceled out only by the security that his presence in the Ministry will prevent the return of Perón.\n\nIn most other issues, González Bergez and Hardoy are one and the same, and his appointment was primarily seen in terms of raising the profile of Buenos Aires conservatives, whose electoral base is far smaller than those of the interior.§!"
 ARG_Adolfo_Vicchi_for_desc: "------------\n§LThe aging former governor of Cordoba is one of the last few national figures of great importance in the 1930s to continue in National Politics. While somewhat less tainted by the fraud of that decade than other prominent conservatives, Vicchi is most well known for his role in plots against Perón throughout the 1950s, being the prospective foreign minister of many-a-hypothetical-revolutionary governments.\n\nWhile Vicchi is quite old, he was preferred over younger candidates due to his deferred dream of holding the post, and because of the outsize role of Mendozine conservatism in Hardoy's triumph.§!"
 ARG_Raul_Prebisch_eco_desc: "------------\n§LA figure of enormous prestige in economic circles the world over, Raúl Prebisch's naming to the Ministry of Economics comes as a surprise. While Prebisch was a functionary in the last conservative government of the 1930s - and had a major role in the oft criticized Roca-Runciman treaty - his adoption of Desarollism in later years stirred the ire of Argentine Conservatism's preferred economists. His proposed solutions to the economic crisis in 1956 also inspired enough ire from virtually all sides as to provoke his momentary exile.\n\nNevertheless, Prebisch was called back to serve as Minister of Economics by Hardoy, evidently as an acceptance of Frondizi's 'desarrolism' as the basis of economic policy. While Prebisch - who invented the term - has a substantially less pro-multinational and more free-market view of the subject, his appointment represents a major victory for Frondizi's plan to exert influence beyond the Presidency.§!"
 ARG_Rosendo_Fraga_hardoy_sec_desc: "------------\n§LSomewhat unexpectedly, the retired General Fraga has returned to his old post in the War Ministry, at the insistence of his brother, a Conservative deputy. Recommended by his role in defending legality during Frondizi's government, he is tolerable to the Azul army, just barely.\n\nMuch more importantly in political terms, however, Fraga represents one of the many former Frondizi functionaries retained or reinstated by the Conservative government.§!"

 ARG_Juan_Carlos_Coral_hog_desc: "------------\n§LCoral has not seen years of militancy of the other party members, but he expresses the same passion. Born in Quequen in 1933, Coral entered the party a couple of months before Perón was deposed from power. He would soon establish a friendship with Alfredo Palacios, becoming his disciple and his private secretary. At only twenty-nine years old, he was elected National Deputy. An idealist Socialist to the core, Coral has been accused of wanting to drive the party towards a more Radical course, influenced by Trotskyist ideas. Nevertheless, the Socialist leadership trusts him due to his passion and commitment to the cause, becoming Minister of the Interior of Romero's administration.§!"
 ARG_Americo_Ghioldi_for_desc: "------------\n§L'Is Ghioldi a political opportunist or just a concerned anti-Fascist?' political magazines ask. 'It depends on my mood.' Ghioldi sarcastically wants to answer, but he knows his enemies are out for his blood. Born in Buenos Aires, Ghioldi follows the family tradition of political compromise, with his brothers Rodolfo and Orestes being Communist leaders themselves. A fervent enemy of Perón, Ghioldi participated in every single conspiracy to topple him out of power and cheered his eventual downfall. His collaboration with the subsequent military government and attempts to challenge the party's guidelines put in jeopardy his political position, with only Palacios's intervention saving him from irrelevance. As Romero's foreign minister, Ghioldi wants to make sure that Argentina doesn't turn his back on the USA, the only country capable of stopping Fascism. After all, someone needs to put the Trotskyists and Peronist sympathizers in their place before they ruin everything.§!"
 ARG_Torcuato_S_Di_Tella_eco_desc: "------------\n§LConsidered either a lazy child of privilege or a distinguished researcher, one of the two heirs of the Di Tella Empire doesn't go unnoticed. Born from a wealthy Italian immigrants family, his father was a philanthropist industrialist that escaped Mussolini's dictatorship. He was supposed to take care of his family's company, but he was more interested in Sociology than the grey life of an executive, disappointing his father. He traveled around the world from Sweden to Israel, even marrying an Indian woman. With other researchers, he founded the Instituto de Desarrollo Económico y Social, dedicated to economic and political research. Through the years, Di Tella's main obsession has been researching how to implement Socialism in Argentina. As Minister of Economy, Di Tella wants to promote the production of consumer goods, cooperating with other South American economies. While he had a particular dislike for Peronism, he is starting to reconsider some of his ideas.§!"

 ARG_Silvano_Santander_hog_desc: "------------\n§LSilvano Santander represents the most hysterical anti peronism in the entirety of Argentina. He is know to the public primarily for his exaggerated, sometimes libelous claims about the pro-Nazi activities of his political opponents, and for being part of the 'perment plotter's corp' during the Frondizi government.\n\nSantander's election as Vice President in the electoral college responded primarily to the Democratic Union's desire to showcase the most strongly anti-fascist figure available. It is possible this objective might have been overshot, as Santander's increasing calls for wholesale purges and investigations into 'totalitarian' activity seem certain to become policy once Palacio's poor health eventually runs out.§!"

 ARG_Aldo_Ferrer_eco_desc: "------------\n§LThe cost to the UD of Oscar Alende's votes was the new government's economic policy, represented by the Buenos Aires governor's protege, the rising economic nationalist star, Aldo Ferrer.\n\nWhile some of his policies are frankly anathema to the conservative sectors who put in much of the UD's votes, the fear of a return to Peronism made the risk of protectionism potable enough. Moreover, Ferrer's policies are in line with the much of the azul officership, which makes his permanence in the government tolerable, for now.§!"

Thought of as one of the most properly 'conservative' members of the Party, his designation attracted few complaints, as he had already performed a role as a federal interventor in Corrientes in the last months of Guidos presidency.

Since the days of Perón's dictatorship, Rojas has been an avid supporter of President Perón, leading all the way up until the coup against him in '56. Since then, his support for the dictator has withered away, and he had vowed to do everything in his power to stop his return. With his forcing of Menendez into the seat of power, it seems he has gotten his wish.\n\nWith his primary goal for the last few years achieved, Rojas has found himself with a new goal: the continued presidency of Menendez until the name "Perón" is forgotten not only by Argentina, but by history itself.§!"

Unfortunately for Juan Domingo Perón, that limit does not exist, not thus far.\n\nFormer deputy and minister of the interior until 1951, Sanmartino found himself sacrificing his career alongside Menendez in a self-coup in an effort to keep Perón from reentering office.

But Colonel Koenig was not a pure Prussian, generations South of the Equator turned them no different from any Gaucho, with all the vices of the race. When he first laid Evita in his attic and saw those blue eyes, that embalmed pale beauty being preserved for all eternity, something inside him changed. The Colonel started having nightmares where Evita walked the house at night, sometimes he would feel a feminine perfume on the stairs, the sound of gracious footsteps coming to greet him when he arrived from work, hear distant voices while laying with his wife, calling him to the attic. Rumors of those nighttime visits started to spread around like wildfire, from the officers in the High Command to the subversives locked in their cells, everyone felt their disgust at the tales of Poggi's most loyal Minister of War that fell in love with the Dead, fear walked along that disgust, if he was capable of that, what else is he capable of?\n\nAs the situation at home became unsustainable, by the pressure of his wife, a trusted Bishop was called to perform an exorcism at the body of Eva Perón.

 POLITICS_AF_DESC: "The second-youngest of 14 children, young Arturo - and all his siblings - was pressured into an intellectual career by his mother. While he attempted to become a footballer to escape this destiny, a series of implausible injuries forced him into the University of Buenos Aires as a law student. Here, the previously mediocre Frondizi excelled, earning a special diploma, which he refused to take on account of the University's Rector appointment by the contemporary military regime.\n\nInvolved in Radical (UCR) politics since then, Frondizi participated in a number of failed military coups before being elected as deputy in 1946, alongside Ricardo Balbin. The pair came to be identified as MIR's leading men, and co-led the faction's takeover of the UCR in time for the 1951 elections, in which they ran as a pair and suffered a humiliating defeat. The two survived by reinventing themselves as the leaders of Perón's sizable opposition. Frondizi in particular wrote a scathing, nationalist book titled, "Politics and Petrol" in which he denounced the Peronist's willingness to sign contracts with foreign oil companies, and was a leading coup plotter - an activity that has since become his favorite pastime - in the many conspiracies to oust him.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of The Tyrant, however, Frondizi's lack of scrupules became increasingly worrisome. Abusing his control of the UCR's National Committee, he imposed his candidacy for President - over Balbin's - in 1958 by decree, creating a crisis that irreparably split the party. When hit with the realization that his own UCR-I could not defeat Balbin's UCR-P, Frondizi resorted to making unkeepable promises to the exiled Perón, with whose votes he won the election. Immediately after taking office, however, he pursued a government along lines entirely disconnected to his electoral programme.\n\nWorse yet, the reveal of Frondizi's promises to Peronists have enraged much of UCRI, and the military, and all three groups have made governing a near-impossible task for him. Indeed, Frondizi's constant scheming - and seeming inability to do so correctly - are rapidly driving Argentina into a political abyss. Paradoxically, however, his vision has been vindicated by the unparalleled success of his industrialist economic policy, a bright-spot dampened by the many politically-motivated strikes and military uprisings that humiliate his government."
 
 POLITICS_PEA_DESC: "Immoral, sociopathic, unfeeling and egotistical, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu is the ultimate distillation of the grotesque politicization of the Argentine Army, capable of changing loyalties or ideology whenever necessary, and completely divorced from any regard for Chirstian morality.\n\nAn unimpressive infantryman that obediently served as a senior officer throughout the entirety of the Peronist regime without incident or conspiratorial inclinations, Aramburu transformed into a fervent Gorila when the winds changed, and played an important role in backstabbing Lonardi as Minister of War. A few days later, he authorized the infamous executions of a few dissident generals and their civilian Peronist allies at the request of the President, Admiral Hartung, and even jailed his close personal friend, General Bengoa, for refusing to abandon Lonardi. Inspite of this subservience, he was not rewarded with a promotion, and remained bitter at not becoming President himself, his longtime ambition which overcomes any consideration for God and Country.\n\nChanging his strategy, Aramburu acted as leader of a pro-Frondizi sector in the Army during the Correntine lawyer's ill-fated presidency, hoping to obtain the UCRI candidacy for the presidency in 1963 by saving him from his imminent overthrow time and time again. Indeed, it was Aramburu who was called upon to solve the crisis that ultimately destroyed Frondizi's presidency, but changed his mind halfway through the affair and betrayed him, too. Rewarded with the leadership of the Army once Poggi's project failed, Aramburu immediately began plotting against General Menendez, in a bid to finally conquer the Presidency. Successfully locking him up in an insane asylum, Aramburu could finally ascend to the presidency himself.\n\nTaking power directly, however, was never Aramburu's plan. Instead, he carefully engineered an electoral law that would permit him, and the array of rancid gorilas around him, to take power by electoral means, with Peronism banned and the traditional UCR splittentred beyond repair by the political convulsions of the last years. From this situation was born UDELPA, a party built entirely around his own figure, who in alliance with the anticlerical PDP, Unionist Radicals, Democratic Socialists, and military interests seeks to maintain a fundamentally unrepresentative and repressive center-left 'softatorship' until the memory of the deposed tyrant can be completely erased by the passage of time."

 POLITICS_JCO_DESC: "Lt. General Juan Carlos "The Walrus" Onganía is a man who lives and dies by rules. Indeed, Onganía's near-fanatical adhesion to structure has been so intense that it has sometimes led him to underperform, as he did at the Colegio Militar de la Nación, where he ended in the bottom quarter of his class. This preference for rigid frameworks also steered the fairly intelligent cavalryman away from intellectualism of any sort, an aversion that when combined with his innate capacity to command and personal honesty, led him to develop as a stereotypical, "tropero," an officer dedicated exclusively to unit-command, who has never held staff or administrative posts.\n\nFollowing rules also made coup-plotting deeply distasteful to Onganía, although his refusal to participate in anti-Peronist plots didn't save him from being exiled to a subordinate role at the Inspectoria General de Remonta, where he languished overseeing horse stables until Peron's overthrow. Following this stint as a nonentity, he became leading tank commander. Sickened by this collapse of organization during the 1960s, Onganía was driven to his breaking point, and together with many of his fellow Cavalry officers, led a campaign to destroy the "Colorados," incidentally saving Argentina democracy, and earning him the position of Commander-in-chief at age 48.\n\nFrom there, Onganía's motivations become far murkier. The reasons for his retirement, his possible involvement in the coup that placed in power, and the extent to which he genuinely believes, or has been gaslighted into believing he is a great leader are almost impossible to determine. What is known is that the contingency plan for a takeover by the military, eventually put into effect by disgruntled generals, necessitated Onganía's appointment as president, something which he only accepted if he were given, "a blank check" to carry out, "an authentic national revolution." What exactly this means, particularly in light of the growing hostility between the mutually-distrustful Liberal and Nationalist groups that coexist in his government, remains to be seen. Nevertheless, Onganía's project appears to have a wide array of backing, including that of most trade unions and large corporations, and even his detractors recognize him as a well-educated, well-intentioned man."

 POLITICS_JLR_DESC: "For Romero, his reputation as a historian is inseparable from the politically committed citizen. From a family of Spanish immigrants, Romero expressed from a young age interest in History and Philosophy. He soon gained intellectual prestige among his peers for his studies in Greco-Roman history, writing for several cultural magazines. Romero's passion for understanding the mechanism of social and economic structures is inexorably tied to his militancy in the Partido Socialista. Fervently opposed to Perón's government, he was expelled from his position at the University of La Plata, but he was named Rector Controller of the institution after the 1956 Coup.\n\n"Peronism" was always such a conflicting word for the Socialist historian. A movement with Fascistic characteristics that manages to gain the hearts and minds of the working class should be unthinkable, almost unnatural. But for Romero, the truth was self-evident: Peronists have triumphed where Socialism has failed. He became one of the main supporters of the change of course spearheaded by the Socialist, trying to appeal to Peronist voters with a more aggressive anti-establishment instance.\n\nHowever, Romero struggles to solve the internal contradictions that have plagued the party in the last years. Is the USA an imperialist power or an ally against Fascism? Is Peronism an expression of the discontent of the workers or demagogic manipulation? Even with his vast knowledge in social sciences, he still lacks an answer. Nevertheless, he has some ideas to solve them: a better educative system, a more plural democracy, better working conditions. Fixing the structural failings of the country is not just the only way of helping the working class but to save democracy itself."

 POLITICS_BALBIN_DESC: "The face of the democratic struggle against Juan Perón and professional loser Ricardo Balbín has now faced the ultimate, crushing humiliation of reaching the post he's fought and lost four times, entirely due to the magnanimity of the man who thrice defeated him, Perón himself.\n\nIn truth, this is only fair. Balbín's overnight catapultation to the forefront of Argentine politics was itself the result of a carefully planned move by Perón: In a bid to atenuate Arturo Frondizi's then seemingly unstoppable rise, Perón ordered a purposefully botched assassination attempt on Balbín's life, which as expected, turned the decent but markedly mediocre intransigeant Congressman into a martyr. Indeed, the plan worked so well that Frondizi was so thoroughly disposed of his majority within the party, that he became resentful enough to himself become a Peronist asset.\n\nWith Frondizi's fall to the Peronists, Balbín remained the only national figure available to the opposition, and so, he tiresomely marched towards certain defeat against Perón and his men every six years, becoming increasingly depressed. It turned out, however, that this image as a perennial candidate had his use. Perón, sensing his impending death and lack of a suitable successor, found a useful transitional and sympathetic figure in this meek opposition leader, and determined to ensure his election as his Vice-President, convinced his mere ascension to the office would prove enough to bring about a peaceful dismantlement of a regime he long ago lost control of.\n\nWith Perón now deceased, it appears his plan is working to perfection, with a small preemptive coup on the part of non-Peronist officers to forestall any movement against the legitimate President, Balbín has had little to do but watch as the Peronist Party collapses on itself. Many, including him, think this means a return to free elections as soon as his term is over. However, the UCRP is not what it used to be, and men like Hidalgo Solá, the increasingly powerful Minister of Defense, have taken the view that it is necessary to elongate the transitional period by predetermining the outcome of at least the subsequent election trough some form of frankensteinian UCRP-PP/PPF alliance, forced with the blessing and direction of the military."

 POLITICS_ILLIA_DESC: "The standard pilgrimage of Argentine politics usually involves young Cordobese lawyers abandoning their native province for a promising future in the halls of power in Buenos Aires. Arturo Illia, by contrast, was a Porteño doctor who made his way towards the miniscule town of Cruz del Eje in the mediterranean province, at the explicit request of Hipolito Yrigoyen himself, who micromanaged the appointment of railway physicians.\n\nSince receiving his posting in 1929, Illia has become immensely popular in Cordoba, proving himself an honest administrator. As the province remained immune to fraud in the 1930s, the Cordoba UCR remained in power, and developed a distinctly intransigent, leftist bent, exemplified by Illia's boss, Amadeo Sabattini. Staunchly loyal to Sabatini's 'Cordoba Line,' he led it on after the caudillo's death in 1960, and distinguished himself as an early anti-frondizist within the UCR. With the brief exception of the three years in which he was Vice-Governor of Cordoba, Illia carried out his political career while acting as the only medic in Cruz del Eje, which he often serviced traveling by horse.\n\nThe figure of the selfless, wholesome country doctor, dedicated to improving the health of his citizens, has proven an invaluable asset to Illia throughout his presidency. However, underneath this fundamentally truthful image of Illia, there is also an aged, not particularly agile man whose view of the world has remained fundamentally static since 1930. His distracted demeanor, antiquated language, lack of vision, and exclusion of non-Radicals from decision making have raised comparisons to the latter-days of Illia's hero, Yrigoyen. Worse still, they have caused an immense feeling of resentment and exclusion from power on the part of a man who, in their eyes, has come in with 20% of the vote to govern in the name of a secretive Radical sect that admits no fault or flaw."

 POLITICS_FRIGERIO_DESC: "Many laughed at Frondizi's shadow, but they are not laughing now.\n\nThe story of Rogelio Julio Frigerio is one shrouded in mystery. Following a brief spell in an obscure group meant to train cadres for a Communist takeover, the young Frigerio exited left wing politics, disgusted at their internationalism. Persecuted by authorities throughout most of the 1930s and unable to finish his university career, Frigerio reappeared in the 1940s as the founder of the Magazine Qué, an intellectual rag closed shortly after the Peronist upsetting the President's wife.\n\nWhen Qué was re-launched in 1956, Frigerio came into contact with Frondizi through the contributions of Radical intellectuals to the publication. The two developed an unbreakable friendship, on the altar of which Frondizi sacrificed all his beliefs. Jointly developing their own distinct current of "dessarrolist" thought with a distinctly pro-multinational bent. Frigerio's hold over Frondizi provoked at first jealousy, and then fear, especially as the sometimes nationalist or peronophillic nature of his collaborators became known. So controversial was his presence that he could not officially be granted the ministry of economics for fear it would trigger a coup.\n\nInspite of all efforts by friends and foes of Frondizi, however, Frigerio became a permanent fixture in the Argentine political sphere, and his Peronist contacts recommended him highly for the post of National Front candidate. Now having undergone the path from pariah to President, and shielded from plotting by an approving military purged of all but the bluest shades of blue and a momentarily pacified Peronist electorate, Frigerio can get to his real programme: The total transformation of the Argentine economy to a modern, European industrialized state.\n\nOf course, there are still obstacles to Frigerio's project. Namely found in the difficulties of planning such a massive endeavour in a country unaccustomed to hierarchical economic orders, or in reconciling the government's declared nationalism - and particularly that of his VIce President, the retired General Bengoa - with the explicit objective of industrializing through courting foreign firms. Last but not least, the exiled Tyrant's desire to facilitate in exchange for giving Frigerio his votes is certain to prove challenging to manage."
 
 POLITICS_JOSE_MARIA_GUIDO_DESC: "In the history of Argentina, the Presidency of the Nation has proven such a coveted position that despair at the notion of holding the office would have been unthinkable, until now.\n\nJose Maria Guido, a well meaning small town attorney from Rio Negro, gained some political fame in 1956 as one of "Frondizi's Leutenants," the group of UCR and later UCRI politicians most aligned with the then-president of the National Committie. Propelled to the Senate in representation of an overwhelmingly Peronist province by the Perón-Frondizi deal, Guido came to be next in line for succession after the resignation of Alejandro Gomez, and again after Balbin's.\n\nAs determined to maintain Frondizi in office as the man himself, Guido refused repeated attempts by the military cabinet and individual officers to take over the presidency. Unknown to him, these had been orchestrated by Frondizi himself, and he would eventually be sucked into The President's plot to ensure his continuity in government after his overthrow. Thus, the anguished Guido was thrust into the presidency, entirely unprepared and sadeneed. His only instructions, received in correspondence from the imprisoned Frondizi, read:\n\n"Guido must renounce The Party. The Party must collaborate with Guido after resigning from the Party. Differentiate the government from the Party. save what remains of the Government. Legislators must not leave and must provide the quorum to the needs. Negotiate institutional stability for now. Challenges must be overcome to avoid civil war."\n\nGuido's tasks, thankless as it will doubtlessly prove given the unpopular measures it necessitates, is further difficulted by the vastly reduced authority of The Presidency, the collapse of military discipline, and the increasing desire of certain generals to end the failed experiment of democracy once again. Above all, however, Guido's own desire to protect his own image, and his horror at the notion of bloodshed, make taking necessary measures to stop them far more difficult than it should be."

 POLITICS_VICENTE_SOLANO_LIMA_DESC: "Dr. Vicente Solano Lima comes from another time, a forgotten era of Argentine politics from before Perón. Born to an aging Rosista father in 1901, he was given the middle name 'Solano' in honor of the Paraguayan dictator Solano Lopez, but this was eventually confused with his surname - 'Lima' - to the point of becoming inseparable.\n\nThe young Vicente opted to become a lawyer, but unlike his schoolmate Ernesto Sanmartino, became associated with Conservative politics. He was elected a National Deputy for the National-Democrats (PDN), and later appointed as chief minister in the Provincial administration of Rodolfo Moreno. It was here that he earned the moniker of, "Red Minister" for carrying out a proto-Peronist labor policy. Displaced shortly before the 1943 Coup, he returned and obtained control of the Buenos Aires conservatives in 1946. Although he was briefly exiled to Montevideo during Perón's presidency for printing conservative newspapers, he consistently denied being an Antiperonist.\n\nBecause of his friendly connections to syndical leaders, and willingness to stand in the rigged Peronist elections, Solano Lima became the face of the PDN throughout most of the 1950s. His conciliatory positions with respect to Peronism placed him and the Buenos Aires conservatives on a collision course with the 'liberal' conservative parties in the interior. The crash eventually occurred in 1956, when Solano Lima's faction backed Lonardi against the navy coup that displaced him. The resulting crisis destroyed the PDN, and Solano Lima created his own party, the Popular Conservatives (PCP), who adopted a pro-Peronist policy. This conciliatory attitude, his defense of Lonardi, and nominal non-Peronism make him an acceptable candidate for the Azul's Frente Nacional.\n\nThe National Front, intended as an agglutination of "productivist" social sectors that, with the support of the military, could carry out an ambitious industrialization project, failed to achieve the universality that its progenitor, the also former-conservative Rodolfo Martinez intended. With most Radicals refusing to participate, it became a proxy for Peronists, Frondizists and Christian Democrats, Nationalists, and the PCP, with Solano Lima at the lead. Unfortunately for the Generals that arranged for the Front's construction, however, Solano-Lima's connections to Perón are far §Ydeeper§! than they imagine."

 POLITICS_EMILIO_HARDOY_DESC: "Dr. Emilio Julio Hardoy has as his mission in life to reconcile Argentine conservatism with the Democracy it created.\n\nBorn to a family of middle-class lawyers deeply steeped in Buenos Aires conservative politics, Hardoy was struck with tragedy at the death of his father at age 16. Picked up by the safety-net of the local Conservative political machine, Hardoy avoided poverty through a hand-out position at Lomas de Zamora municipal government until becoming a lawyer. Brought along to the Buenos Aires provincial party by his benefactor, Hardoy labored away his entire youth working for the Conservative Party.\n\nEarly connections paid off, and Hardoy was elected a National Deputy in 1935, aged 24, in widely fraudulent elections won by the rebranded National Democratic Party. This particular election haunted Hardoy and the rest of Argentine conservatism for years, and the system which enabled it to happen was eventually overthrown in 1943. The displaced Conservatives were engulfed in a deep internal crisis, victimized by the electoral system they themselves had created in 1912, and which now left them almost entirely without representation. Moreover, their exclusion from the Union Democratica by the recalcitrant Radicals against whom they had committed fraud left the Conservatives as a virtually irrelevant third force in national politics.\n\nIn every crisis, lies in an opportunity however, and Hardoy's repeated, arbitrary imprisonments at the hand of Peronism earned him the same status within the Buenos Aires conservatism as that treatment did Balbin in the UCR. His only provincia rival, Vicente Solano Lima, removed himself from the picture by forming a splitter party, leaving the soft spoken Lawyer in charge of the monumental task of reviving Argentine conservatism.\n\nOver the next decade, Hardoy fought hard to overcome the malaise and pessimism that engulfed the renamed Buenos Aires onservative Union, and his brainchild, the National Federation of Centrist Parties. While he succeeded enough to 'win' the highly fragmented, anarchic elections that followed Frondizi's presidency, the truth is the FNPC is not a proper party, and the conservatives are not fully reconciled with post-1916 democracy. Even Hardoy himself, and his 'democratizer' wing openly called for the overthrow of Frondizi in the darkest days of his administration. Hardoy's task, apart from the not at all easy job of seeing through the entirety of his term, is to properly build a proper conservative Party with a genuine popular base."

 POLITICS_RAUL_POGGI_DESC: "Described variously as a gross hillbilly - "campechano" - a mediocre officer, and the prototypical arrogant gorilla, Lt. General Raúl Poggi represents perhaps the worst facet of the Argentine military.\n\nAn unknown officer undeservedly promoted as a result of a conscious policy of the Frondizi government to favor Military Engineers, the once upon a time Torranzist Poggi betrayed his mentor shortly before he fell victim to ill-advised plots. Rewarded with the leadership of the decapitated Army, Poggi let himself be influenced by the navy leadership, which did little to help his unpopularity with his own branch of service.\n\nApparently oblivious to the growing movement against him, Poggi developed even grander ambitions, manipulated by the Admirals along the way. Frondizi's misfortunes once more opened the way for an undeserved promotion, and Poggi marched his merry way into the Presidency after attempts to find alternative solutions failed, confirmed in his post by a Junta dominated by the navy.\n\nWhile Poggi merrily signs decrees he makes little effort to read, however, the country and Army underneath him are beginning to unravel. The sheer extremes to which the now unleashed forces of anti peronism are willing to go are eating away the relative tolerance and aversion to violence that had characterised Argentine politics, even in times of undemocratic governments.\n\nAll the while, the mediocre general has been under increasing personal pressure, and his fits of rage become common, especially as the collapse of army discipline makes the figure of Army Caudillos, far more popular than himself, increasingly important."

 POLITICS_BENJAMIN_MENENDEZ_DESC: "For Major General Benjamín Menéndez, coups are not a pastime, but a lifestyle. Unfortunately, he has never been very good at carrying them out.\n\nAfter entering the army in 1910, Menedez was involved in almost every conceivable and failed coup attempt. A one-time nacionalista and germanophile officer, he repeatedly failed to overthrow the governments of General Justo and Dr. Ortiz in the late 1930s. He gladly supported, but was blindsighted, by the June 1943 revolution against Castillo, and by the successful imprisonment of Perón in 1945. When the Democratic Union government was set to move him into the reserve for his attitudes during the war, he attempted to topple them too, but failed to get any supported Shortly thereafter, the cavalryman became a fervent liberal and collaborated with Radical Unionists in a botched attempt to preempt Perón's presidential assumption in 1951.\n\nImprisoned for the rest of Perón's presidency, Menéndez was freed, but kept away from any important posts. Growing increasingly worried by the prospect of a Peronist return over the course of Frondizi's presidency, he attempted to overthrow him twice, but was often bullied by younger officers who 'stole' his generals, and had no role in his successful ouster. Finally, however, the end of Poggi and his clique forced the navy, at risk of losing its power and prestige, to scour deep enough into the pit of presidentiable retired generals. Thus, the plot which propelled Menendez and Rojas into the presidency and vice presidency at the behest of a junta controlled by the latter, was born.\n\nThe extreme element of luck involved in Menendez's umpteenth and ultimately successful coup plott aside, the 70 year old General faces serious questions about the viability of his presidency. While quite lucid, his up till now story of uninterrupted failures, subservience to the navy, former germanophilia, and general mediocrity have cast doubt on his usefulness. Moreover, his attitude towards the worsening Peronist violence appears to run counter to the growing calls for moderation within the army."

 POLITICS_RODOLFO_MARTINEZ_DESC: "Few in Argentine politics stand out from the innumerable legion of lawyers - "los doctores" - that occupy the majority of dependencies in all three branches of government. Until recently, Dr. Rodolfo Pastor Martinez was not one of them.\n\nA Conservative lawyer from Cordoba, Martinez became a judge in the 1940s after a brief spell in the army, where he served under the-then Major Eduardo Lonardi, who in turn was married to his cousin. His legal career was cut short, however, when his membership in the Democratic Union's national committee drove him into politics, having a brief run as leader of the Cordoba Democratic Party, before being pushed asid.\n\nA known member of the anti-Peronist opposition throughout the next five years, Martinez played a key role in the founding of the Christian Democratic Party. When Lonardi toppled Perón in 1956, he was appointed to the Consultative Junta in representation of the new party, and upon the general's defenestration, he was elevated to Minister of Industry.Throughout his time in Hartung's provisional administration, Martinez remained one of the most vociferously anti peronist figures in the government, and struck up a close friendship with the minister of War, General Aramburu. Given tenure at the University of Buenos Aires shortly thereafter, he temporarily retired from politics.\n\nMartinez's return to the stage in the dying days of Frondizi's government, at the behest of Aramburu, proved a turning point. Insenceded with his political friend's u-turn on whether or not to oust the Intransigent president, Martinez broke off relations with him retroactively became a Lonardist, aligning himself with the deceased general's allies in an effort to revive his political project. After facing a coup attempt and clearing the last attempted hurdles of opposition from generals linked to Alvaro Alsogaray, Martinez and his protege Mariano Grondona have successfully hijacked Guido's interim administration to create the National Front, and electoral vehicle with which, they hope, it shall be possible get the country moving, while neutralizing Peronism by integrating it into the political system."

 POLITICS_ALFREDO_PALACIOS_DESC: "Alfredo Lorenzo Palacios was born to a wealthy Uruguayan family in 1878, and became one of the earliest members of the Socialist party, for which he was elected a National Deputy in 1904 during a brief experiment with individual constituencies. There, Palacios befriended his fellow deputy, Conservative former President Carlos Pellegrini, with whose support he managed to pass progressive labour legislation, that to this day forms the basis of his considerable popularity amongst Buenos Aires' industrial workers.\n\nAs the rising star of the Socialists, he seemed their ideal candidate from the first elections employing universal suffrage in 1916, but was expelled for engaging in duels over the love of a woman, whom he ultimately declined to marry. Exiled from politics for most of the 1920s, Palacios developed a formidable academic career, before being called back to lead the Socialists in the aftermath of an internal split over attitudes Yrigoyenism.\n\nWhile his following grew considerably in the 1930s, when the Socialists formed the largest parliamentary opposition group to the UCRA-Conservative government, the advent of Peronism after 1943 virtually erased the Socialist's voter-base, and Palacios' membership in the first Democratic Union earned him only a short stay at the Labour Secretary previous occupied by Colonel Perón, abolished shortly thereafter. Seemingly destined to fade into the background, with his position in the party threatened by the likes of Americo Ghioldi, the failed attempt to forestall Perón's investiture thrust Palacios back into the foreground as leading member of the opposition.\n\nFollowing Perón's fall, the aging Palacios was appointed ambassador to Uruguay, returning in 1958 to run for the presidency for the second time, coming in a distant fourth. After his upset senate victory in 1961 prevented the ailing PS' division, his figure experienced a resurgence, and he begun to be talked about as the candidate of a potential anti-peronist front, to which the 85 year old Palacios agreed upon being convinced by Ghioldi that he was the only man potable enough to Radicals and Conservatives alike to command their votes.\n\nThe aging Palacios, right or wrong, has now done the impossible: He has defeated Peronism - albeit without Perón - at the ballot box, and culminated 70 years of political activity with a victory unprecedented in Argentine history. While his advanced age grants him no chance of seeing his term through, President Palacios will die happily, knowing his election prevented the return of §YTotalitarianism§!, for now..."
 
 POLITICS_JUAN_DOMINGO_PERON_DESC: "Twice toppled, twice returned, Colonel Juan Domingo Perón has accomplished what not even Juan Manuel de Rosas could.\n\nWith the begrudging consent of his erstwhile detractors, the catholic-nationalists, the suicidal support of some imbecilic leftists, and the self-imposed legalism of certain Azul generals, Perón's agents were permited to co-opt the §QNational Front§!, and blitz through a series of events to enable his return.\n\nAlthough they do not yet realize it, the aforementioned amalgamation of useful idiots who sleepwalked their way into permitting the return of the same man they once deposed, is about to have its expectations of a Perón more amenable to their particular visions for the future of Argentina fully defrauded.\n\nEffortlessly restored to his position, this astute paragon of Argentinity can only be left to reach the same conclusion as everyone else: Peronism pays. In line with this, Colonel Perón has determined no fundamental modifications to his original government, so rudely interrupted in 1956, are necessary. And so, to the tune of the Marcha Peronista and an overwhelming majority of votes, Argentina happily marches back into the previous decade.\n\nFor the forty percent of the country unfortunate enough to disagree with this project, the returned Colonel can only offer lodgings at Villa Devoto Prison replete with the familiar hospitality of the Special Section for the Repression of Communism, and of course, the latest item in his inventory of wit and wisdom:\n\n"§YI§! did not return because I was good, but because §Vyou§! were far worse.""

 POLITICS_ROBERTO_MARCELO_LEVINGSTON_DESC: "Roberto Levingston's presidency could not have been imagined as the improbable premise of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta.\n\nTaken from his comfortable post as military attache in Washington by a set of curious chances revolving around the rejection of all other possible candidates from shortlist of 12 illustrious generals and civilians in which he did not figure, and informed by phone of his appointment while at dinner, Levingston's tale may rank as the most bizarre in all of Argentine History. This grotesquely humorous incident, exacerbated by the obscurity of the new President, known only to the few insiders of Argentine intelligence service, has served to characterize him as a clueless stand-in for General Lanuuse, strongman of the Junta which appointed him.\n\nThis, however, could not be further from the truth. Indeed, contrary to what anyone could have imagined, the Rightist spook General Levingston has embarked on a ballsy crusade, with radical leftist Intransigent-Radical surgeon Oscar Alende, as his only ally. Alone against the world - and the might of Lanusse's junta - the pair's only hope rests in the success of Alende's left-nationalist economic plan, and Levingston's power plays in the army - where he is outranked by Lanusse. This self-proclaimed "deepening of the revolution" while received with apathy, and even mockery, from a citizenry weary of years of military rule and boisterous discourse\n\nFaced with such disinterest about their fate on the part of those they seek to protect, this last desperate charge of the nacionalistas against the approaching tsunami of military liberalism becomes not only strange, but nearly hopeless and by extension, romantic. Whether history will remember it as such, or merely as the tragicomic attempt of an intelligent but overambitious army officer out of his depth and a political fossil whose presidential credentials approach zero each passing day to upend the entire political establishment from Perón to Lanusse, remains to be seen. Either way, Levingston and his motley crew of ideologically diverse companions have little time until the curtain draws on the Argentine revolution. If it is to have a happy ending, now depends on them."

 POLITICS_ALEJANDRO_AGUSTIN_LANUSSE_DESC: "Alejandro Lanusse is the prototype, albeit not the stereotype, of an Argentine military caudillo. Well connected, well educated, and with the ability to pretend he is neither one nor the other, this gruff nephew of perhaps the last caudillo to precede Perón - Agustín P. Justo - has come to represent the image of the army to many in Argentine society.\n\nHis debut in the world of Coup D'etats, in which he would be a professional player if it were a sport, was playing a major in the ill-fated Radical Unionist attempt to forestall Perón's 1951 inauguration, as a Captain. Imprisoned until 1956 over that attempt, Lanusse paid his liberator, General Lonardi, with betrayal by initiating the conspiracy that toppled him less than a month after his release. Subsequently playing a major role in shaping the rise of General Onganía from his prestigious position within the Cavalry, he was amongst those that pushed him to crush the Colorados in 1962.\n\nOver the following years, Lanusse and Onganía were often identified as friends, but the later's government - which Lanusse did much to bring about - proved a disappointment, and so Lanusse once more betrayed and overthrew his benefactor - who had named him head of the army - hoping that a brief interlude by a far less relevant general would pave the way for his own election. His hopes were dashed once more, however, and eventually came to the conclusion that the least embarrassing option would be to take control of the government directly.\n\nThis, however, doesn't mean an end to his ambition to become President legally. Indeed, Lanusse has arrived at the seat of power with a vision for the future: The past. More specifically, his uncle's past. His plan is to recreate, as best as possible, the coalition of forces that formed the long-deceased Concordancia, and with them, to promote his own candidacy to beat Perón at his own game. This task, already daunting, has been further difficulted by the military's loss of prestige over the past few years. Nevertheless, Lanusse, and his minister of Interior, the prestigious UCRP congressman Arturo Mor Roig, will attempt it anyway. Indeed, they must, for Lanuuse knows that, with the ban on Peronism no longer sustainable, his free-election is now the only thing standing between Argentina and the return of the tyrant."

 POLITICS_ISABEL_DE_PERON_DESC: "Without a doubt the most unfortunate consequence of the deceased leader's poor taste is that amongst all the extremely talented politicians in the Female Peronist Party, it was his wife that was chosen to represent them.\n\nIsabel Perón is, without any doubt, a brute. Indeed, she is perhaps the single least intelligent or capable person in all of Argentine public life, having failed to pass the 5th Grade. At the time, she found it much more enticing to opt for dance school, from which she graduated into the job market with a stable employment at a Venezuelan brothel. It was here that she met recently exiled and depressed widower Juan Perón. Whether possessed by lust or afflicted by an enormous lapse of judgement, the former President took his trophy concubine to Iberia when he was forced away from the South American continent, and was regrettably forced to marry her after one of General Franco's prudist fits.\n\nHaving acquired a notoriously Castillian accent during her time in Iberia, Mrs. Perón returned to Argentina to fulfill the ceremonial role of first lady - one requiring tact and mannerisms far in excess of her limited brainpower - but was rapidly bored. To relieve her apathy, she drifted towards the social circle gravitating around §RJosé López Rega§!, a Peronist Party functionary who was a onetime Burgundian intelligence asset with shared interests in the occult arts.\n\nThis might have yet remained an ultimately unsubstantial relation if not for the failure of Perón's plan to leave either Jose Rucci or Ricardo Balbín as his successor. Without a candidate to nominate in a hotly contested national convention, the Peronist delegates chose the least controversial choice possible: The President's wife. In effect, the selection of a woman so unprepared, uninterested, and incapable was equivalent to the appointment of her closest advisor: §RLópez Rega§!. Indeed, he has not wasted any time in making this known, as shown by both the numerous designations of his allies to powerful or lucrative government positions, and the increasing impunity of his personal deathsquad, which operates from the premises of the Ministry of Welfare.\n\nWhile labour and the military have thus far tolerated §RRega§!'s presence in the halls of power as a useful tool for the destruction of left-wing Peronism, his privileged position has now become untenable. It is now only a matter of how much damage he will cause before other sectors can force a different shadow-master on the nominal president."

 POLITICS_RODOLFO_MARTINOVIC_DESC: "No one can tell exactly when the War against Ricardo Balbín began. When precisely, did the arrogance of Buenos Aires and its national committee finally broke the patience of Arturo Illia's closest supporters cannot be precisely determined. What is known is its bizarre outcome, and the benefit it brought to the governor of perhaps the most peripheral state of all.\n\nRodolfo Martinovic was born in Buenos Aires, the child of Croatian immigrants. Somewhat stereotypically for a Radical politician, he studied medicine, and moved to the unforgiving, frigid Patagonian South to exercise said profession. He became politically recognized in his adopted home of Santa Cruz for his role in founding the Province's principal hospital. Still, this was not enough to succeed against the immense power of Peronism in the rural south, and prospective deputy-governor Martinovic experienced a humiliating defeat at the hands of the peronist-supported UCRI candidate in the Province's first elections in 1958.\n\nMartinovic was not done, however, and in any event, the brave stance earned him support to run in 1963. His campaign style, general demeanor, and almost messianc attitude earned him - probably sought-after - comparisons to Janio Quadros. In any event what earned him national status wasn't this, but the permanent hostility to which he was subjected to by Balbín's men in the provincial UCRP, and his aggressive responses to it. In an attitude that reflected growing disillusionment with his handling of internal Radical-Party affairs, Martinovic launched an open against the President of the National Committee, quietly aided by Illia and the Cordoba Line, to which he belongs.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, this Patagonian Quadros won his showdown with Goliath, and with Illia in control of the national executive, there was no one else to fill the shoes of a Presidential Candidate but himself. On the campaign trail, he repeated his provincial strategy, and his calls to clean up Buenos Aires' notorious politics, stand up for the rights of the Interior, and reimpose Presidential authority resonated enough to hand him the presidency. Indeed, the Yrigoyenist tone of his campaign, unseen in Radical circles for years, is generally credited for his victory. Now, however, he has to face the reality of governing, which has been made ever so much harder by his declared opposition to just about all non-Radical political, sindical, and social sectors. Moreover, his enemies in the UCRP, ever resentful of his attacks on Balbín, have begun making moves to defenestrate him."

 POLITICS_CIPRIANO_REYES_DESC: "Revenge is a dish best served cold, and Cipriano Reyes has been waiting for his plate for nearly two decades.\n\nReyes was once a leading trade unionist, whose dream was to replicate the success of the British Labour Party in the context of a rapidly industrializing Buenos Aires urban area. This dream was co-opted by the arrival of a certain Colonel to the Undersecretary of Labour, who turned Reyes' dreams into a personalistic nightmare. Nevertheless, he tried to make it work. Indeed, between 1943 and 1945, few men worked as tirelessly as him to ensure the success of Perón's career. When his jailing made him ineligible for the candidacy that year, Perón ordered his supporters to cast blank ballots. Reyes disagreed, and ran for president himself, and in 1952, against Perón.\n\nFor his trouble, the dissident labour-leader was jailed by both Radicals and Peronist governments, but offered a post within the Lonardi administration, which he was unable to take up due to its short existence. Nevertheless, he was determined to revive the Labour Party, and slowly but surely worked with trade-unionists who grew increasingly tired of Perón's leadership from afar. His success in creating an antiperonist-peronist front with Augusto Vandor's union, and several neoperonist politicians, enabled him to wrestle the reins of the labour movement away from the Colonel, once and for all. In addition to the dissident Peronists grouped in his own PL, the UP, PTB, PP and several MPPs, Reyes, helped by former-President Frondizi, has amassed the help of a wide coalition of smaller parties, ranging from Frondizi's MID, to Christian Democrats, and even some far-right Nationalist parties.\n\nThis victory of political ingenuity and independent labour has completely upended the Argentine political scene, as has the military's willingness to allow Reyes to take office. While what happens from now is a mystery, one thing is certain: The era of Perón is over, and Reyes has been its undertaker."

 POLITICS_JUAN_CARLOS_CORAL_DESC: "Juan Carlos Coral's career has been defined by an eternal struggle with the followers of Peron. Yet now, after a three decade grasp on the politics of Argentina, Peronism lies ripped apart by authoritarian verticalists and independent neo-peronists. Can its death grip finally be loosened?\n\nCoral began his career as a sturdy member of the Socialist Party's left wing. A few years prior, his ascension would have seemed highly unlikely. Yet the ban of the Peronist movement left an outlet through which the Socialist Party could prosper. By the time the Peronists were allowed to return, they were divided and angry, a shell of the old party. Disillusioned, many former Peronists abandoned their old parties and voted Socialist - propelling President Coral to victory.\n\nNow the Socialists prepare to take back the voters who once abandoned them for Peron, and solidify themselves at the forefront of Argentinian politics. At first, Coral might not seem up for the task. His politics are as far left as they come, yet he still dresses in ancient garb. To the public, he appears as a morbid carbon copy of the Socialist Party's late leader. Yet there is a strategy behind his oddities. His actions, his politics, his personality, all are tailored to absorb the rural believers of Peronism as they splinter and feud.\n\nThat, and to prevent the army from discovering his Trotskyist sympathies. Hopefully, that is a bridge he will never have to cross."

 POLITICS_EMILIO_JOFRE_DESC: "If there was any moment that things could change for the aging conservative movement, it would be this one. In the hands of Emilio Jofré, conservatism lives or dies.\n\nBorn to wealth in the province of Mendoza, Jofré first rose to prominence when he managed to snatch the seat of Governor from Peronists and Radicals alike. By the late sixties, Jofré was one of the most successful conservatives of Argentina. It was the perfect moment, as the conservative parties began to realign, re-emerge, and eventually, reform. In Emilio Jofré, they had their candidate.\n\nImprobably, the campaign worked - Jofré and the PDC soared into power. Now, Jofré must form the first government ruled by a unified conservative party since 1943. It is an immense challenge, but Jofré is up to the task. While his milder anti-Peronism and feminist leanings might be at odds with many in his party, his acumen has allowed him to gather a cabinet that might turn back the tides of reformism once and for all.\n\nIt might seem insane that Emilio Jofré is so calm. To those within his party, his success - or his failure - will drive the fate of the Conservative movement for decades to come. But this is just his job. In the face of expectations, there is nothing he can do but get to work."

 POLITICS_ISAAC_ROJAS_DESC: "Admiral Isaac "Black Ant" Rojas, so named for his love of broad black sunglasses and his diminutive stature, or perhaps because he shamelessly chases after power like an ant.\n\nOf course, Rojas now faces a similarly ignominious fate. Once a major powerbroker in the military junta and ally-turned-arch-enemy of Perón, Rojas has lost considerable influence after unwisely backing the Poggi and Menendez administrations. Rojas, his power over everything but the navy having slipped far from his grasp, has now been forced to fall in line with Aramburu's plan to control the country. As part of the scheme, Rojas now briefly serves as interim president of the Republic until elections can be held, the "victory" of Aramburu in which is considered a foregone conclusion by political analysts. Few are certain what will become of Rojas after Aramburu takes power, Rojas himself least of them all."

 POLITICS_JULIO_LICASTRO_DESC: "There is no President of Argentina, only Major Julian Licastro, chief of the "Peronist Technological Command"(CTP), an organization that would appear as an invention of poorly written fiction, were it not so real. A junior officer graduating at the top of his class, Licastro's Peronist sympathies assured him unprecedentedly fast promotions, and an appointment to head Peronist Technological Command. This department of the Peronist Party, tasked with long-term political planning and establishing a functional Peronist philosophy, has now taken control of the machinery of the state.\n\nWhen Peron's Vice President, elected in an emergency, appeared to deviate far too quickly from established peronist tennents, Licastro knew that it would be the death knell of the revolutionary process that began in June 1943. Thus forced to revolt against the government he pledged allegiance to, he, Colonel José Luis Valoni and other junior Peronist officers, and young members of the Peronist party such as Julio Barabro and Carlos Grosso launched an emergency coup to save Peronism from itself. The CTP officially "intervened" the Peronist Party in order to reform it in view of making it more sustainable. More specifically, Licastro has promised to attenuate the purges of leftist Peronists, and is working hard to forge a consistent ideological framework for Peronism to operate within.\n\nThis is easier said than done. While Licastro may rule the nation, he is paradoxically a subordinate, and indeed quite junior, Army officer. He walks upon a tightrope. The established Peronist political class no doubt plots against him, and the loyalties of many members of the CTP are themselves in question. Inspite of these challenges, Licastro is determined to enact his vision, but whether his government of junior officials and ideologues, many of them fresh from university, can survive long enough to complete it remains in question."

 POLITICS_CARLOS_MENEM_DESC: "Being the lord and master of La Rioja,Vice-President, a professional rally car driver, a devout muslim family man, and media personality all at once is not an easy task. Nevertheless, Carlos "the Turk" Menem performs all of these simultaneous roles with glee and charisma unmatched by professional demagogues the world over. Indeed, this admirer of Facundo Quiroga, who had his political start less than twenty years ago, grew to be popular enough to scare even Perón himself.\n\nElected governor of La Rioja briefly before Perón's return in 1964, he proceeded, as Peronist governors often do, to turn his Province into a firmly controlled feudal domain, home to some of the most outrageously lopsided elections throughout Perón 's second and third governments. Even before securing this base, however, his permanent visits to other provinces pointed towards a long-term electioneering campaign, the benefits of which would someday be reaped. So it was that when the time came, Menem was able to force his own election as the ailing Perón's Vice-President and effective successor.\n\nRunning on a comically demagogic platform so manifestly divorced from economic reality as to make many of his own supporters question its seriousness, Menem came to be identified not only as the "continuity" candidate, but as one who would do Peronism even harder than Perón himself. This in part is true, Menem has every intention of maintaining the regime and its methods. However, Menem's appreciation of the economic and geopolitical situation is completely different in private than it has been in public. Convinced of the inevitability of America's victory in the Cold War, and the inefficiency of the Argentine economy, the new President has decided - at the detriment of traditional tenants of Peronist ideology - to adjust the regime accordingly.\n\nThe last hurdle before Menem has the political strength within the Peronist Party to do so lies in snap elections he has called, a move which has provoked a controlled but significant thaw, to the extent it has become a real contest. His opponents, grouped either in the §CAuthentic Peronist Party§!, made up by the remnants of purged leftists within the PP/PPF, and the §MRadical Civic Union§! thus have some chance of defeating him. Indeed, as an unnervingly popular campaign slogan promoted by the former points out, traditional Peronist may find themselves at risk of voting for §YMenem§!, but electing §lAlsogaray§!."

 POLITICS_MANUEL_DE_ANCHORENA_DESC: "Sporting a surname that Eva Perón qualified as "reeking with manure," Manuel de Anchorena has endured all the humiliations and suspicions engendered by his extremely privileged background for one purpose: Using Peronism as a vehicle for for his life's goal, the rehabilitation of Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires between 1835 and 1852. While this goal may seem far too esoteric to dedicate an entire life on, for a very significant number of intellectuals, nationalist militants, and trade unionists, it is a holy crusade of historic importance.\n\nFor this landowner-rancher turned Peronist politician, the mission to restore his namesake to glory has also provided him with a sizable constituency within the Peronist Party, adhering either to traditionalist or fascistic political currents, that shares the same objective. With their help, Anchorena was catapulted into his hero's former post, the Buenos Aires governorship, and later the Vice-Presidency. Now at the helm of the ship of state, Anchorena's first priority is to ensure Rosas' rehabilitation, to levels higher than even many of his supporters imagined possible. Indeed, he has explicitly denounced the legacy of the 1853 Constitution and liberal thought in general and looks ready to progressively liquidate all remaining traces of both in the Peronist Constitution, all the while restoring certain aesthetic ornaments used in Rosas' days.\n\nOther than this crusade against liberalism, Anchorena appears to have left the government primarily to his cabinet, an odd collection of like-minded trade-unionists, army officers, and peronist party functionaries of relatively diverse ideological extraction, which has, save for some economic cutbacks, more or less retained most of the policies in place at the time of Perón's passing. Indeed, the only area in which Anchorena's government has proven particularly proactive has been the repression of leftists, irrespective of their ideological origin. In particular, the increasingly pervasive activities of ministers Oscar Ivanissevich and Alberto Ottalagano are drumming up rumors of a large-scale purge more akin to those common in Germany."

 #ARG_peronist_resistance: "Peronist Resistance"
 #ARG_peronist_resistance_desc: "The particularly repressive actions of the Menendez dictatorship turned the decline of Peronism into a rebirth: Walk-outs, strikes, protests, and the occasional bombings have become everyday occurrences in an Argentina without Perón. The proscription of the Justicialist Party is not stopping dozens of other parties running on its behalf. Despite President Frondizi's more conciliatory attitude, it is clear this subversion is not stopping any time soon. From his exile in Iberia, Perón continues to try to egg on the disturbances through nefarious means, including those of his personal Representative, John. W Cooke. If this is not adressed, the Resistance could make the job of governing Argentina virtually impossible.\n\n§REven worse, Perón himself could take advantage of the situation to get back into the country...§!"

 #ARG_azules_and_colorados: "Azules y Colorados"
 #ARG_azules_and_colorados_desc: "Army factionalism is not a new thing, but it seldom reaches levels as explosive as those of Argentina. Following the end of the short-lived Lonardi presidency at the hands of the most liberal, anti-peronists sectors of the armed forces, the Argentine military has been increasingly split into two camps: Blues and Reds.\n\nThe Azules seek to maintain and deepen Argentina's status as an observer in the Triumvirate, ensure the "domestication" of peronism by separating it from its leader, and to ultimately depoliticize the armed forces, while allowing for Constitutional continuity of the civilian government. On the other hand, the OFN-aligned Colorados see peronism as a fascist movement, and a possible conduit towards communism. Their inmidaite goal, it appears, is to instate an indefinitely long military dictatorship, and use the apparatus of the state to quash Peronism once and for all.\n\nIn their struggle for total control over the FAA, the victim is usually Frondizi's administration, which has been subject to over 50 humilliating §Rplanteos militares§!, which force him and his government to change policy at the whims of specific officer, threatening perpetual §RAcuartelamientos§! as preludes to coup'd etats."

 #ARG_anti_americanism: "Anti-Americanism"
 #ARG_anti_americanism_desc: "The unashamedly pro-Axis government of the 4th of June Revolution met an inglorious end at the hands of general Alvaro Eduardo Avalos, in 1945. The resultant election gave a narrow triumph to the sycophantically Anglophile Unionist government of 1946-1952, whose deference to America created a lasting resentment.\n\nAfter his own election in 1952, Perón thought that he could be on good terms with both the USA and the Triumvirate, which he joined as an observer. He was wrong: Abandoning the OFN's trade embargo was seen as an attempt to increase German influence in South America. This led to a series of policies, which when combined with the arrogant behavior of ambassador Spruille Braden, that only worsened popular perceptions of the United States.\n\nThe population didn't take this foreign meddling too well. From college students burning American flags outside the embassy to officers receiving mysterious foreign phone calls, a good chunk of the population - including much of the army - hates anything with Stars and Stripes. This has made it harder for politicans to openly advocate for closer relations with the OFN."

 #ARG_economic_woes: "La Malaria"
 #ARG_economic_woes_desc: "Once a shining light of growth and progress, Argentina has fallen on hard times. Since 1943, growth has slumped, inflation soared, and slums multiplied. The central question which Argentine governments now face is how to adress and reverse this decline, which has been popularly termed La Malaria.\n\nAt present, the Frondizite economic "developmentalist scheme" necessitates massive amounts of foreign capital to invest in the country, as well as an unprecedented volume of capital-good imports, in order to meet the demand for the flourishing new industries. This has, in turn, caused runaway inflation, which has further difficulted the overbearingly difficult relationship of the market economy with the large trade-unions, the CGT (Confederacion General del Trabajo) in particular. If not managed correctly, these difficulties could bring Frondizi's project to an ignominious end."

 ARG_the_death_of_discipline: "The Death of Discipline"
 ARG_the_death_of_discipline_desc: "The reincorporation of anti-Peronist officers purged throughout the 1950s, and the simultaneous purge of Peronist and Lonardist officers unhinged the traditionally strict hierarchy of the Argentine Armed forces, and eroded discipline to levels unseen almost anywhere in the civilized world.\n\nThis destruction of established traditions within an army has had two outward manifestations: A permanent micromanagement of political affairs by groups of reincorporated officers paranoid about a possible return of Perón, expressed in the constant and humiliating §Rplanteos militares§! that have forced President Frondizi to give in to military demands time and time again.\n\nWhile there is a §Ygrowing reaction§! against this state of chaos, President Frondizi and others, determined to avoid responsibility for bloodshed, have refused to give the "Profesionalists" in the military the orders which they paradoxically need in order to crush the constant mutinies.\n\nMoreover, the continued validity of the §YDe Facto Government Doctrine§! wherein the legality of coups is upheld by longstanding elements of Argentine case-law, makes the prospect of §R"Revoluciones"§! an ever-present danger."

 ARG_structural_unhingement_desc: ""For a long time, the greatest ailment afflicting Argentina is the inauthenticity in almost all its manifestations. Due to the lack of a solid cultural base, cowardice or comfort, in Argentina almost everyone "pretends." The country itself proclaims to be a perfectly normal and even democratic nation, even as it is obvious that everyone is used to disguising themselves as what they are not. This discrepancy between the real country and the apparent, formal, nominal nation becomes most apparent in the political field."\n\n- Dr. Pablo Gonzales Berges"

 ARG_greekback_lira_blues: "Greekback Lira Blues"
 ARG_greekback_lira_blues_desc: "An almost pathological obsession haunts the Argentine population. In the front-page of newspapers, the opening monologue of satirists, at trade union congresses and the Chamber of Commerce, there is one topic of conversation that brings shivers to all with a stake in the future of the economy: The price of the Italian Lira, or in some quarters the U.S. Dollar, relative to the Peso.\n\nWhile the obsession with the price of foreign currency is to some extent inflated by buying sprees spurred by sensationalism in the media, the mercantile nature of the Argentine economy makes the price of foreign currency a more or less accurate outward expression of the terms of exchange and confidence in the economy. Thus, a government's §jeconomic performance is, above all, likely to be judged by the price of foreign currencies at any given moment§!."

Their first measure was a sweeping, and unprecedentedly thorough purge of the Army, which has decimated the ranks of the infantry, and engineers. After the purge, almost all senior posts now lie with the Azul cavalrymen and their allies in the Artillery, a situation which is expected to last for at least a decade."
