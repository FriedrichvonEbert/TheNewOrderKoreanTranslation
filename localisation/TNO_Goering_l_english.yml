 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC:0 "Göring once made a public challenge that if any Allied bomber dare reach the Reich that forever after he would be known as Hermann Meier. The success of Nazism in the World War proved his bluff wise, and Göring was soon sure to cut himself a piece of the great pie the victors greedily dove into once the Allies lie destroyed.\n\nUsing a mix of a somewhat political able mind and several excessive uses of blunt force, namely in the deployment of thugs, militias and 'patriots' to harass and drive off any threats to his power, Göring has centered himself as the sole politician in the Reich who truly listens to the pleas of the soldiery. Seeing no other way to power, he has surrounded himself by uniformed sycophants who have convinced the aging Führer that the only way for the Reich to prosperity would be through the utter destruction of its enemies.\n\nNow, Göring goose-step arm and arm on what many consider a rapid road to the destruction of the Reich. That is assuming he is soon stopped however, for one can only imagine what may happen once Göring sets his sights overseas..."

The corrupt Judeo-Capitalist Americans humored themselves by calling Germany "the sick man of Europe"; now, they will be reduced to scorch marks by our glorious Luftwaffe.\n\nThe time has come to prepare ourselves. One last time shall we enter the breach to transform the fate of the entire world, and the planet itself will bow to the majesty of the Aryan Race. To arms, men!"

 GER_GOR_wrangling_the_reichstag_desc:0 "The global oil crisis has hit Germany hard. The militaristic faction in our administration, who have exerted their influence on us for so long are currently in total disarray.\n\n Much of the power they hold has been temporarily stripped thanks to the chaos and upheaval the crisis has caused. The power Schörner and his clique wield at the moment is minimal at best.\n\n There is no time to waste! Now is the perfect opportunity to put these power hungry bastards in their place! Göring and his allies currently have enough power to remove their rivals from the administration! There is no time to complete this; now is the time for action, and to secure the Reich once and for all for Führer Göring!"
 GER_GOR_the_great_purge_desc:0 "Where there was once a vicious discordance of gunshots and explosions, a dull silence now fills the void. The screams have faded, the dust has settled, and the taste of blood and smoke lingers in the air like a distant memory... but the final body has not yet fallen. Victory everlasting is sweet to the tongue, but there are still toxic elements that threaten to spoil the flavor. Littered throughout the Reich like an infestation of rats hide our most craven of foes, those who foolishly believe that the end of the Bürgerkrieg heralds their safety.\n\nThey are wrong. From the liberal scum who blindly followed the lies of Speer to the Bormannite weasels who protected the corrupt status quo, our Great Purge will spare no traitor. With great aid from Reichsmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and the Wehrmacht, Göring's triumph shall be maintained for years to come!"
 GER_GOR_crack_down_on_the_bankers_desc:0 "Banks are inherently untrustworthy organisations - good Christians were forbidden from usury for centuries, relegating the practice to Jews. While we may have eliminated the Semitic menace from our institutions, it seems some of their practices have rubbed off on those who have replaced them. Many of the bankers threw their lots in with Bormann, sealing their fates. Those which did not would do well to keep their heads down while we deal with the traitors among them - and learn well from their mistakes."
 GER_GOR_nationalize_the_banks_desc:0 "The banks have been allowed too much leeway in their dealings. Foreigners, traitors and fools have all received their funding and it is time we end this wastage. Shackling them to the state will ensure their loyalty, and provide a valuable source of cash to fund our plans for the Reich. We don't need to pay them of course - those bankers left are eager for an opportunity to prove their loyalty."
 GER_GOR_a_bayonet_for_the_bankers_desc:0 "Complacency is what got us where we are now. We were complacent with the students, with the bankers, with the rest of our party. No more. We will ensure our grip never slacks on the banks, and keep tabs on whoever is left there. They redoubled their efforts when they never saw their traitorous colleagues again - perhaps this atmosphere can be sustained? They are all guilty of something, and removing one every now and again will do a great deal to remind them where their place is."
 GER_GOR_cage_the_students_desc:0 "Germany's universities have been its pride for many years. Countless Nobel prize winners came from these hallowed halls, and some of the greatest technical minds of this century have been German. Time takes its toll however, and for the past decade the Reich's students have been nothing but a thorn in its side. They have turned to discredited ideologies such as democracy and even socialism, and with the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg many Universities rose up as their own statelets. Most, such as Münich and Heidelberg were quickly put down, but those in Albert Speer's territory frequently survived and swore their loyalty to him. While we may have removed Speer from the board, his pawns remain.\n\nThe rubble of the universities is easily picked through. Dig out the students and throw them in a cell. They'll learn the price of their hubris soon enough."
 GER_GOR_round_up_dissidents_desc:0 "There are enemies around every corner, even if there are a few less corners after the war. The Catholic Church has ever been troublesome for us. The Reichskonkordat may have officially stabilised relations with the Vatican but we stopped paying attention to it long ago. Catholics are everywhere in Bayern and Ostmark, and the priests there too often take it upon themselves to interfere in matters that are none of their business. They learned the value of a good speech long ago, and we must make sure they are unable to give them. \n\nBorders become a lot more porous when all the guns are pointing inwards. Smuggling has taken hold in the East and South, with businesses often turning to their counterparts across the border. We might be able to excuse this if it was a temporary measure but their greedy ways have persisted after the war's conclusion. Punishment is in order. All of these traitors will be confined to prison camps until the Wehrmacht decides whether it is worth killing them."
 GER_GOR_a_bullet_for_the_traitors_desc:0 "The war was long and hard fought, and many still are not willing to accept the proper state of things. Heydrich's SS have been dug out but Bormann and Speer's people remain, ready to resume their sabotage at a moments notice. Anyone willing to serve those who would bring the Reich to ruin is an idiot at best and should be eliminated as a hindrance or a traitor and must be eliminated with prejudice. We shall not make the mistake of letting them live."
 GER_GOR_school_militarization_desc:0 "School is where a mind is honed before it enters service. Children are the future, and Hitler was wise enough to see that. The Hitlerjügend was to be our youth's first taste of a martial life back in the thirties, and we need to inspire a thirst for that now just as much as then. \n\nA gruelling time is ahead of us, and our children need to be prepared for that. A greater focus on physical education will prepare them for the wars ahead. Reichsmarshall Schörner himself has recommended we relax grade requirements - it would be cruel to insult the men who will go on to fight on the front line by giving them failing grades, and there are much better things to educate them on. Every week our youth will perform atomic bombing drills - just in case. Duck and cover, children. "
 GER_GOR_and_chains_for_the_thinkers_desc:0 "We may have dealt with this latest round of rebellious students, but what of the next one? And the one after that? It is our duty to maintain discipline in our children. We shall have Wehrmacht guards stationed at university campuses, officers monitoring the lesson plans, and a few thousand Reichsmarks will buy us a disproportionate number of student informants. What else do students have to complain about but money?"
 GER_GOR_faith_in_the_gun_desc:0 "If things have not calmed down, they have at least stopped heating up. Arms on every street corner do a great deal for one's peace of mind, and have restored faith in the Führer's ability to keep things under control, if not his legitimacy. The rebellious voices have been silenced for now, and if we keep a lid on things they will stay that way. All we have to do is maintain faith in our soldiers, our tanks, and our guns."
 GER_GOR_pride_in_the_fuhrer_desc:0 "Führer Göring has done what seemed impossible, and vanquished all pretenders to his title. That evil administrator Bormann; Speer, the architect of the Reich's destruction; Heyrich, the Man with the Iron Heart who tortured and murdered across Europe. If Hitler's faith in him was not proof of his legitimacy then the destruction of all of his foes certainly is. We should be proud of our Führer, who has fought and commanded across Europe since the First World War, and brought victory in his wake."
 GER_GOR_prepare_the_new_germany_desc:0 "Germany proper has once again been stabilised and the traitors and pretenders destroyed. Now it is time for us to reclaim our rightful Lebensraum as we did two decades ago. Thankfully it will be somewhat easier this time, with no Soviet Union to contest our mastery of Europe. Only our former subjects exist to oppose us - the Americans and Japanese are half a world away. And once we reassert our control, we will be ready for them."
 GER_GOR_prepare_the_army_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht was shattered in the Bürgerkrieg, split into four and set against itself. While we may have gained the greatest share, more than half our officers cannot be trusted, and who knows how many enlisted men. A pruning down is required. Further still, the war proved our tactics outdated and our Heer old fashioned. It must be reformed if we are to reassert control over Europe, so that we may crush our enemies, see them driven before us, and hear the lamentations of their women."
 GER_GOR_a_new_age_of_science2_desc:0 "Never before have our generals had such an influence in policy; they did win us the war, after all. Naturally, they expect their opinions to be heard, and lately they've been clamouring for more funding. A few of the more imaginative of them have been digging up old ideas, ideas discarded as "impractical", and "unfeasible", and "too dangerous to sanction". These ideas may not lead anywhere, but it doesn't do any harm to let them dream. Send some funds down to our research departments to entertain them."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_0_desc:0 "Denmark, Ostland, the Netherlands, Bohemia,Poland and Slovakia. Every journey begins with a first step. And the path to restore the Reich's glory lies in securing it's immediate and rightful sphere in Central Europe. These operations have been given the name War Plan 0. Resistance is expected to be futile and miniscule."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_A_desc:0 "Now that the Reich's control over central Europe has been reestablished, the Wehrmacht is already looking to the Balkans, Scandinavia, the British Isles and the rest of our Reichskommissariat in the East. War Plan A will involve securing control of these vital areas through German steel. This shall not only restore the Reich's pre civil war territory, but also bring order to those nations still defying us in the Baltic and the Balkans."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_b_desc:0 "To have conquered the crumbling states surrounding the Greater German Reich was a matter of inevitability. Now the time has come to immortalise the Fatherland's standing in Europe once and for all and crush the vicious powers that seek to destroy us from without. To the east lie the teeming subhuman masses, huddled within the rotting remains of Russia; with just one final push the Slavic hordes will be crushed under the mighty boot of the advancing Wehrmacht. To the south await the scheming Italians, monkeys in suits who bicker and hoot among themselves while undesirables roam free. Only once the Reich claims victory over Iberia and Turkey can we secure a hold on the Mediterranean, and then nothing will prevent Italy from falling just as Rome had centuries ago."
 GER_GOR_five_year_industrial_plan2_desc:0 "We may talk the talk about the renewed Germany, but it's time to walk the walk. Our factories lie in ruins,  our streets are paved with rubble and our fields are filled with the dead. We must rectify this before any attempt is made to restore control outside of the Reich's core.\n\nLearning from one's own mistakes is good but learning from our enemies is better. The Soviets had a good idea or two while they were around, and the Five Year Plan is one the Führer in his economic wisdom has set his sights on. Our industrial planners will draw up estimates - how fast can steel production be brought back to pre-war levels? How quickly can roads between supply centres be repaved, how quickly can chemical production be expanded? A deadline makes everyone work harder. "

 GGR_invade_denmark_desc:0 "Helmuth Johannes Ludwig von Moltke was one of Germany's greatest generals. Under his command Prussian soldiers marched through Denmark, Austria and France, trampling each under their heel and forming the Second German Reich in the process. The war for Schleswig-Holstein in 1864 extended Germany onto the Danish peninsula, and Hitler's Reich put the rest under our supervision. Now, we must finish the job. Last time it only took six hours, so this time should be a squeeze."

The swift capture of the city is vital to crush the Danish will to fight. The Luftwaffe will deliver the Fallschirmjäger from above, while the Seebataillon push onto the shores.

 GGR_grenadiers_desc:0 "There is a sentiment among many German generals now that we need some behemoth of an army but it should be realized that this is just not logistically feasible! The German Military should be what it always has been and what it always should have been, an elite deadly force of a few honorable, well-equipped divisions ready to set out and die for their nation. If we bloat our army with borderline undesirables then we will end up with a disaster on our hand it has become clear that a Prussian Army cannot be corrupted by weakness and so only the fittest should be allowed to fight for the valor of the Fatherland. "
 GGR_germanies_finest_desc:0 "There were many among the military during the civil war who's acts of strength were not recognized by us at the time and that is truly a shame. Yes, many Germans did fight valiantly to defeat those who wished to corrode the Reich but many did truly extraordinary things. We need to find such Untermensch and give them the rewards they deserve, like perhaps promotions so that our Army will be led by the greatest men Germany has to offer. When we succeed the army will be a true and glorious Prussian army that even the great Fredrick would tremble over! "
 GGR_intensive_training_regimen_desc:0 "Strength and great power are what is in the hearts of every German man but some have more of it than others, thus we need to weed out the weaker ones and elevate the strongest. Our training will be harsh, it will be grueling but it will be necessary. Those who can not deal with this will be tossed aside as they are a better fit in the factories but those who do will be warriors like those of Sparta and those who do survive will be so full of valor and fire that no nation shall dare challenge us ever again. Now is the era of Strength and those who do not adapt will be trampled underfoot! "

The great infantryman who has shown valor and strength throughout all of the time and to choose these tools of them would make use just as degenerate as the Americans! Mechanized units have proven time and time again to be a strain on our economy and the lack of oil in our homeland means we are dependent on the control of our colonies. Tanks and whatever else should primarily be supported should complement the strength of our infantry and not overshadow them. "
 GGR_knights_of_the_panzerkorps_desc:0 "The distinguished and renown Panzerkorps must be continuously reviewed and modernized if we are to truly succeed in creating a modern blitzkrieg.

These prestigious knights shall be at the forefront of German propaganda, and shall be given various honors commending their bravery and heroics."

 GGR_legacy_of_the_ghost_division_desc:0 "First in the line of fire, first into hostile land, the elite Panzer division known as the ghost division has gained incredible fame through their oppressive offensive blitzkrieg during the last war. The ghost division has proven the strategic ability of tanks on the battlefield, and we must never forget this if we are to create flexible and dependable armored units. Leaders of the Panzerkorps will be given extended logistical support as well as more freedom to move independently on the battlefield. This way, our tanks shall strike at the enemy with a ferocity and surprise never seen before."
 GGR_volksgrenadiers_desc:0 "In the past few years, it has become apparent to German High Command that simply having superior fire power is not enough to overwhelm and annihilate our foes. We must, in addition to having superior tactics, be able to overrun and crush the enemy with our superior numbers. We shall have reserve divisions for every fighting squadron, so that  should a German soldier tire or falter, another proud German patriot will take their place on the battlefield."
 GGR_quality_of_quantity_desc:0 "No matter how many guns we make, we will need a man behind every gun to actually fire them. The wars of the past have proven to us that manpower is a far greater tool than that of superior firepower. By utilizing a larger and more organized army, our forces will be able to tactically overwhelm our foe and achieve our goals much easier."
 GGR_gun_in_every_hand_desc:0 "While our conscription efforts for the army have paid off, it seems as if our armaments production has not quite met its increased demand. We must not allow our soldiers to go onto the battlefield unarmed, and as such decisive action must be taken. Engineers and industrialists from all across Germany shall be convened to determine how to deal with this sharp increase in firearm demand."
 GGR_citizenship_through_service_desc:0 "Our war machine is vast, but it needs more fuel! We can have all the oil, guns, tanks, planes, and food in the world, but all of our material is simply of no use if we don't have the men to utilize it. Fortunately for us, there are ways to "encourage" the population to get them to offer their services to the army without implementing conscription.\n\n We have decided that the only way Germans can obtain full citizenship (which includes state benefits) is for every German citizen to put in their time in the Wehrmacht. Only real Germans, who serve the Fatherland are deserving of becoming full citizens of the Reich!"
 GGR_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Artillery is the queen of war. She brings great effect to the field, shattering enemy resistance and removing any obstacle that stands in the way of our advance. And should we defend ourselves, it is a remarkable shield that keeps them at bay.\n\nTo preserve the lives of our young men, it is our priority to improve our artillery pieces and to secure better methods at using them. Further work on this branch should aid our army."
 GGR_gun_for_every_meter_desc:0 "A wise Japanese officer once made a comment about the Americans. And he stated that "there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass," should they attempt an invasion.\n\nWhile this demonstrated to us that our former allies in the East considered the American threat with due respect, this must mean one thing to us. If we apply that idea to our homeland, it would be possible. But for every meter of our land, there will be more than just rifles; there shall be stores of ammunition and supplies. And our troops will make any enemy pay with their life."
 GGR_grenadier_panzer_operations_desc:0 "From 1939, everyone has clearly seen the mighty power of the Reich's panzer divisions, and many even regard panzers as the only strength that contribute to our numbers of success in the past thirty years. However, what they failed to understand is, panzer divisions may also find themselves in trouble that they cannot handle on their own, and that's why the Panzergrenadier divisions are created.\n\nWorking with the panzer divisions on the battlefield, the infantries can eliminate the anti-tank defenses alongside all other kinds of obstacles. With proper cooperation, our panzer can reach their full operational capacity during the battle and lead the Reich's other arms sweep into the enemy's heartland with unstoppable momentum. And that's is just the key of our panzer's matchless splendid records."
 GGR_restore_the_armies_grandeur_desc:0 "A long time ago, before the unification of the Fatherland, Prussia was called an army with a state. And from then one, the army become the strongest forces in the world, which led the fatherland toward a united German Reich and brought greatness to our people. Ask anyone about their impression about Germany, and they'll immediately answers the Wehrmacht without hesitation. \n\nHowever, the army itself never get what they deserve, even in the Reich's most glory days. Being old and incapable of leading the country, Hitler tried to subvert the army, not to speak of the reformist traitor Speer's attempt to limit the army's power. No, such attempts will never succeed, for the Wehrmacht is the greatest brunch in Germany, and it will become as strong as the Reich itself. The army has defended Germany through centuries, and it will continue to do that till the end of the world! The restoration of the Armies Grandeur will ensure the Reich's glory in the next Millennium!"
 GGR_rebuild_the_prussian_staff_college_desc:0 "Becoming a general is the dream of every brave child in our nation, but being an officer requires outstanding abilities and qualities and only a few could realize their dreams at the end. To achieve such a dream, one must sacrifice a lot and spend their whole life learning about military. Thus, the old Prussian Staff College must be restored to give them proper education and training so that they can become the eligible officers that the Fatherland need them to become. \n\nAnd beside the education they can receive, becoming a graduate of the Prussian Staff College also means great prestige and fame. Our people will understand how much the officers have sacrificed to become capable protecting them and how distinguished they are. And that's what our generals deserve."
 GGR_cuff_titles_and_new_uniforms_desc:0 "The decline of militarism in the Reich has many deep causes, but one important reason is that, our people have forgotten what becoming generals means and lost their respect toward them. To correct such a mistake, our people must be reminded of the differences between they ordinary people and the generals who protect the Reich, so that they can find their respect toward the generals back.\n\nIn Napoleonic age, the Generals used to wear special and gorgeous uniforms which manifested their nobility and dignity. And now, we can return to that old tradition and hire top designers to design new cuff titles and uniforms for our generals. A fair bird has fair feathers, and the king of all birds must have the most magnificent feathers to make everyone acknowledge his status."
 GGR_end_political_interfearance_desc:0 "For too long , those stupid and selfish bureaucrats have been making absurd decisions and poisoning every aspects of the Reich. And only thanks to the army did we successfully saved the Reich from its enemies within. This fact proves that the general staff has collected the smartest minds in the Reich, and the decisions they've made cannot be disrupted by some lay fools in the government. \n\nFrom now on, the Wehrmacht will become totally independent from all other departments' influence in the Reich. The army as a whole will answer to no one but the Feldmarschall in the world. Oh, and of course, the Führer has the ultimate control of the army after all. At least on paper..."
 GGR_masters_of_the_world_desc:0 "Aryan people are destined to become the master race of the world, and the Wehrmacht will guard us fulfill our own fate. Twenty years ago, we were so close to such a glorious status, but in the end, the internal corruption and decadency stopped us from it. But now, the army have been baptized by the flame of civil war and totally reformed after that. Free from all kinds of political interference in the Reichstag, it will function perfectly and lead the German nation toward greatness. All hail the Wehrmacht, sword of we German nation! All hail Germany, master of the world! "
 GGR_pride_of_the_reich_desc:0 "For anyone in the Fatherland, he should not forget that our Führer is once a fighter pilot in the Second Reich's air forces when he was young, neither should he forget that without him, the Third Reich's Luftwaffe couldn't even exist. When the Reich's fighters fly over the land and smash our enemy's defense, the whole world would say contribute it to the Führer's genius. \n\nTherefore, while we praise the Heer and the Kriegsmarine for their bravery and loyalty, our people need to be reminded that the Luftwaffe is also a pride of the Reich and their trustful guardians in the sky. And most importantly, they will be reminded that who created such an invincible force and that's whom they must respect with all hearts."
 GGR_strike_like_lightning_desc:0 "Fast as the wind and as swift as a soaring eagle, our close air support shall strike at the hearts of our enemies with fear and desperation. Before a counterattack can be arranged, our planes will swoop in and out leaving tremendous damage in their path. Our enemies will never feel a moment of peace, as they will constantly have to worry about an impending aerial assault from our fighter pilots. "
 GGR_higher_faster_better_desc:0 "While our pilots are already considered elite and highly trained, their combat abilities could be further enhanced with better fighters. German engineers must be put to the task of developing faster and more agile fighters in order to better suit our pilots. With the power of German innovation and ingenuity, our enemies will be torn to shreds while we fly higher than we ever have before."
 GGR_destruction_of_nations_desc:0 "Our successful bombing campaigns in Africa and Russia has proved to us one thing: the complete and utter ability for our bombers to rain destruction upon our enemies. They have been left crippled and weak, crawling about like cockroaches too scared to fight. It is pivotal that we continue to develop our bombers in order to ensure our enemies can never fully recover from the destruction left in our wake."
 GGR_barons_children_desc:0 "The Red Baron is considered by many to be the greatest pilot of all time, and as such he has had a tremendous impact on the legacy of the Luftwaffe. Perhaps we could use this influence as a means of recruiting new pilots and help train the next generation of the Luftwaffe.  We will implement a program known as "Barons Children" in order to locate distinguished fighter pilots and allow them to recognize their full potential on the battlefield."
 GGR_fighters_without_equal_desc:0 "Time and time again, the Luftwaffe have proven themselves to be the utmost elite fighting force in the skies. Our fighter pilots outclass even the most veteran of our adversaries, showing the world that our pilots are a force to be reckoned with. The Luftwaffe has created some of the greatest pilots in history, and they should be recognized and commended accordingly."
 GGR_knights_of_the_sky_desc:0 "Even the greatest of pilots can have humble beginnings, and by making this clear to the people we can usher in a new era of elite German aces.  The German people will no longer see the path to becoming a pilot as unattainable or impossible, but rather as an honorable and worthy position given out to the best and the brightest Germans who are willing to give their all."

 GGR_the_parachute_is_obsolete_desc:0 "As of late, it has become increasingly clear to German high command that the implementation of the parachute on the battlefield is dysfunctional and obsolete. Parachute runs have proven to be far more dangerous than they are worth, and we simply cannot risk wasting German lives on the battlefield. Instead,  air assault divisions shall be utilized in order to  transport our troops on the ground and to provide tactical support to the Wehrmacht."
 GGR_over_any_ground_break_any_foe_desc:0 "From the dense African jungle to the sprawling fields of Russia, our Luftwaffe shall reign supreme. Regardless of terrain, our fighter pilots will maneuver through the skies to annihilate all those who stand in opposition of Germany."
 GGR_reichsalders_desc:0 "Sworn protectors of the sky, our Reichsalders will watch over us with an undying loyalty to the Reich. Our intensive labor towards improving our air force has finally bore fruit, and our grand air force  will guide the  German people for generations to come. Our foes may try to retaliate and break our spirit, but they will never snuff out the indomitable light of the Luftwaffe!"
 GGR_deutsches_auslandisches_freikorps_desc:0 "While we have seen the passing of many great military minds in Germany, it is time we begin to encourage those in the Reich who wish to further develop our airforce and refine our flight programs. After all, we cannot properly secure the fatherland without the contribution of every German citizen working towards our cause."
 GGR_strategic_defence_desc:0 "War in the age of nuclear weapons in many ways differs from pure conventional war. If we are to ensure, that the Reich's defensive capabilities are up to the task, then we have to concentrate the existing expertise. Let's found a council dealing with strategic defense. The Nuklearstrategische Rat shall serve us well."
 GGR_repair_the_reichs_defences_desc:0 "While the Reich is littered with Bunkers and underground installations from the World War and the 50's, many of them are either outdated or in varying states of decay or disrepair.If we want to sufficiently protect our people from nuclear attacks and their aftermath, then we will have to restore and modernise as much of these legacy shelters as possible."
 GGR_modernise_the_seigfreid_line_desc:0 "One especially large bunker complex left to rot in recent times are the fortresses of the Siegfried line. Built originally to ward of any potential French attacks on the heart of the Reich, now the line could prove useful once again. With some engineering tricks it can be refurbished to both protect the populations of Alsace, Baden and the Palatinate if a nuclear shelter is needed, but also serve as an additional safeguard against the Burgundians."
 GGR_modernise_the_fuhrerbunker_desc:0 "The Führerbunker was a contingency bunker for use by the Führer himself, should the situation of the Reich ever become desperate enough. Thankfully it so far has not been needed. This means however, that the bunker is just as outdated, as the rest of the Reich's shelters. For a man of Führer Göring's stature, such a meagre housing is of course wholly insufficient. It's time for a modernisation project."
 GGR_crisis_response_teams_desc:0 "To survive any crisis means to be properly organised. And since a nuclear war is the ultimate crisis imaginable, it will need an organisation that can handle this crisis. The Führer has thus decreed the creation of so called Crisis response teams that will prepare and help the German people to survive anything our enemies can throw at us."
 GGR_duck_and_cover_desc:0 "The insidious powers that stand against us, would like nothing more than to destroy our very way of live and our future. Hence every school in the Reich is instructed to hold multiple "Duck and Cover" drills every year. Even our youth will then know how to protect itself from the evil attempts by the Reich's enemies to destroy us with their nuclear arsenal."
 GGR_tighten_atomic_security_desc:0 "The nuclear missile silos are the heart piece of our nuclear strategy. However in the past the Silo's staff and commanders were a cauldron of Speerites, Bormannites or even the SS. This is not a mistake the Führer will repeat. Only the most loyal men handpicked by Göring and Schörner themselves shall oversee such a vital task."
 GGR_new_silos_desc:0 "While our current nuclear silos are sufficient in keeping up the threat of MAD, they are still too concentrated in certain locations and thus we risk being wiped out in a decapitation strike before we can retaliate. Hence building up new and more importantly spread out silo installations in all corners, are vital to the defense of the Reich."
 GGR_new_missile_designs_desc:0 "The nuclear arms race means a constant effort to improve, to overcome and to adapt. Obviously our missiles are no exception to this. A fresh investment into new and improved missile designs will ensure our silos can't be taken out before the missiles leave for the counterstrike."
 GGR_safeguard_the_volk_desc:0 "With our recent efforts the security of our Volk from nuclear annihilation has been, if not ended, then at least mitigated. Our grand investment into both technology and concrete has ensured. The German people rejoice for such a caring Führer, that has taken it upon him to spare them the horrors of nuclear war."

They will make a perfect first target, and the taste of rapid victory will tantalise all those who have ever had doubts in the Führer.

Indeed, our top military minds claim that Norwegen could and would have held out against any attackers for decades. However, traitors from inside destroyed the Reichskommissariat, and the fool Terboven handed the Reich's greatest fortress over to the people and abandoned Norway to them. Now, the Norwegians own and occupy our miles of forts and bunkers, and promise to be one of the greatest challenges to invade.\n\nHowever, this does not faze our great Führer Göring, who expects-no, demands- a victory to rival 1940. After all, the Wehrmacht was able to crush organized resistance and an Allied force in just over a month. By using those same tactics, along with some of our newest technology, we will certainly win a victory just as great, if not greater, than our first conquest."

Instead, they have preserved the Fascist government that was in place during Terboven's rule, and seem to have kept at least some of our own ideals.\n\nIt has been recommended to the Führer that, instead of attempting another invasion of Norway, we should instead extend an invite to this new state to rejoin the Reich and retake its rightful place as our fortress. Though many of the militarists, notably Schörner, have complained about what they see as the politicians taking their glory, it is widely agreed upon that no Germans should die over such a rock as Norway.\n\nWe can only wait and hope they accept.

Indeed, Norway has potential to be a major hub for the Kriegsmarine, giving us near total control over the North Sea, acting as a counter to those bases in Iceland, and allowing us to reach into the Arctic. Unfortunately, the bases have slowly wasted away, due to the relatively tight budget of the Kriegsmarine in the last 20 years and the loss of control at the start of our Civil War.\n\nTo fix this, we will send thousands of slaves and materials to fix these bases, turning them into the great harbors and naval bases to rival those in Iceland. While this will undoubtedly cost millions of marks, the potential naval dominance will certainly make up for it, and besides, when has financial cost ever stopped our projects? "

Therefore, an obvious solution presents itself in the form of the Kriegsmarine. The new Norway's navy is barely existent in the first place, and will stand absolutely no chance against the might of our battleships. By using our fleet to cut off major ports and blockade the coastline, we will shatter the Norwegian economy, causing economic collapse and driving the Norwegians to poverty and starvation. If the plan succeeds, the Norwegians will be too weak to lift a finger against our forces when we land.\n\nUnfortunately, this plan does have some flaws. The Kriegsmarine is underfunded and still somewhat damaged from the chaos of the civil war, and currently is not in the best shape to conduct any large scale operations such as a blockade of the long Norwegian coastline. In addition, the fortifications we built with German sweat to hold off any western invasions, complete with naval guns, are undoubtedly now in the hands of the traitorous Norwegians, and may be used against our fleet.\n\nBoth of these problems are easily fixable, of course. Pumping money into programs is one of Göring's strengths, and the sheer might of our cannons and weapons will undoubtedly be enough to obliterate whatever puny resistance the Norwegians may put up. In any case, the operation is expected to be a success."

One of these many improvements came in the advent of the helicopter, which has revolutionized airborne warfare. Where once airborne troops would have to leap from bulky transport planes in limited numbers, now full squads of men can be quickly and efficiently transported in helicopters. Not only that, but helicopters can also be used as a form of close air support, supporting troops and providing quick fire on any enemies on the ground. By using this fascinating new technology, we can swarm the resisting Norwegians with a cloud of steel and lead, overwhelming their defenses and seizing ports before they can mount a defense.\n\nOf course, helicopters have their drawbacks. Their slow speed makes them susceptible to anti-aircraft attacks, and their air-to-air capabilities are limited at best. However, with the numbers we will bring, this will not matter.

To combat this, we shall use an invention that the strategists of 1940 could only dream of- missiles. By building up bases in Denmark, we will be able to fire missiles of all kinds into the mountains of Norway, obliterating any bunkers and forts in a hail of rockets and bombs, without a single German man being forced to lay his life on the line.\n\nIn addition to the immediate strategic benefit of these bases, they will also be a fine addition to our defenses against any American incursion into Europe, covering the entrance into the Baltic and much of the North Sea. Indeed, some have even gotten to asking why these positions have not been built before now. While the answer to this mainly lies in the economic downturn of the 50's, this issue matters little to the current situation. For now, we can rest easy knowing that soon all of Norway will be under the reach of our missiles."

This new restriction will hopefully drive the two nations to desperation, and severely hamper their economies.

This development, while unfortunate for obvious reasons, has left the Oberkommando in an even larger state of outrage than normal. As shown by Schörner in a long winded rant, this boils down to two primary reasons-\n\n1. Ukraine, as it stands, is a nation run by the Slavs, for the Slavs. This situation is a natural want of those Slavs that still live within our borders, which means a risk of rebellion is now a serious concern.\n\n2. As previously stated, Ukraine is the breadbasket of the Reich and its territories. Without its vital fields and grain, we may be looking at a famine sooner rather than later.\n\nThese two issues have sent Schörner and his clique into near-apocalyptic fits of rage, advocating for an immediate invasion with whatever we have.

As of right now, whatever forces we have on hand will be redirected straight to the Ukrainian border, ready for immediate operations, Though this attack will be disorganized, chaotic, and confused, surely the superiority of the Reich's soldiers will easily overwhelm any resistance that comes up.\n\nThis decision has been met with cheers from those in Schörner's clique, who pushed heavily for immediate actions. Those outside of Schörner's clique, however, have had mixed reactions to the move. Though they will be willing to stand aside for now, some rumors have been reported that perhaps Göring is not truly the man in charge of Germany's activities, ridiculous as that claim is.

This situation is unacceptable, and as such Schörner has introduced a rapid emergency plan: mass conscription.\n\nThis conscription would take men off the streets of our major cities, giving them rifles and rudimentary training, and throwing them into the front line as stopgap units. While the skill and quality of these units is guaranteed to be suspect, it's the only reasonable option for the continued success of our operations.

Furthermore, Schörner has argued that, in the last few years, the Reichskommissariats have not been paying their fair dues to the Fatherland.

As grating as this is to the Führer and to those who disagree with Schörner, we are at least able to ride the coattails of his success to boost our own popularity within the army.\n\nOf course, we could slow down our attack and plan the rest of our assault out, taking precautions to defeat the rebels through more thorough, slow means.

Of course, these two points are now being hammered furiously by a seething Schörner and his acolytes.

To that effect, they wildly succeeded with our help, seizing Karelia and Kola. However, it seems the Finns have forgotten why they were able to reclaim these territories in the first place. Ever since the 50's the Finns have drifted away from our sphere, going so far as to begin looking for trade deals from our greatest enemies. It is time we reminded them to respect those who gave them the fruits of victory.\n\nGöring has ordered preparations for a new invasion into Finland to be made, in case they are foolish enough to refuse to rejoin the Pakt. By bringing back the Finns into our alliance, we will slice off one of America's last lines into Europe, and gain nearly unparalleled access into the Arctic.

Some of the weaker willed men in our army seem to fear the fighting skill of the Finn, pathetic as it may be, simply because they were able to destroy the Judeo-Bolsheviks Slavs as any good European race should!

With a quick storming from our brave soldiers, we will be able to secure the islands, currently in Finnish hands, for our own use.\n\nOf course, the Finns owning these islands also posts a diplomatic issue- the seizure of such a major base will not be taken lightly by the traitors in Helsinki. Indeed, such a seizure could be interpreted as a declaration of war, and to take such a risk while unprepared is a foolish measure.

 GGR_fall_rot_desc:0 "The time has come to finish what the predecessor of our glorious leader begun. When Hitler defeated the corrupt and decadent imperialist and bolsheviks powers, He didn't see fit to install a truly German administration to rule over the entirety of Russia: despite His incredible wisdom, this was a mistake, and cost us dearly during the subsequent war with the Western Russian Front.\n\nOur new leader, however, has vowed to put an end to this sorry state of affairs! Like an avalanche, we shall crush the last pitiful remnant of the Soviet Union, and integrate it into our ever-growing domain! The eternal snows of desolate Siberia shall be melted by the fire burning in our hearts! Heil Göring!"
 GGR_reinforce_the_garrison_desc:0 "For more than a decade, Reichskommissariat Moskowien has been the first line of defence against the Russian chaos. Now, however it will become the bridgehead from which we shall launch our unstoppable offensive!\n\nIn order to prepare for the inevitable beginning of the hostilities, we need to ensure that Moskowien is properly defended against any threat coming from the East. To this end, the German garrison will be bolstered by fresh troops, while we muster our army for the invasion."
 GGR_enlist_the_locals_desc:0 "In order to prepare for the offensive, we need as many men as possible, and the Russians of Moskowien are perfect to bolster our numbers. Though their valor and skill are far inferior to what we can expect from our fellow Aryans, they are loyal enough to prevent the risk of rebellion.\n\nAlso, their numbers are already a great advantage, and being Russian themselves they shall make perfect occupation garrisons for when we start to consolidate our control over the conquered steppes."
 GGR_mercenary_army_desc:0 "Due to the relative scarcity of true Germans, dozens of mercenary bands operate throughout the border regions of Moskowien, paid by both authorities and privates to protect villages and industries from both raiders and terrorists.\n\nIf we want to further increase our numbers, we can enlist these armed groups into the army with the promise of a nice payment at the end of the war. While these men are completely disloyal, they'll make fine meat for the meatgrinder, and we won't even have to pay them after..."
 GGR_proud_sons_of_germania_desc:0 "Grossraum Germania is the largest metropolis in the world! Even though such a notion brings pride to every true German around the world, it does have its downsides: after the first economic collapse, and even more with the upheaval that followed the Bürgerkrieg, the amount of poor and unemployed Aryans has reached staggering numbers.\n\nHowever, we can now solve two problems with one, intelligent solution. By conscripting the unemployed masses, we shall both grant people a honorable way to earn a salary, and increase our army for the coming war. Our homeland has so much untapped potential, and we shall exploit it all for the good of the Reich!"
 GGR_cornwalls_finest_desc:0 "The Cornwall garrison is an elite unit made up of decorated veterans and extremely capable officers. By enlisting their aid for the coming war, we'll be able to not only make use of them in a suitably difficult environment where they'll be sure to shine, but also increase the morale of the entire army, as the common soldiers will be honored to fight alongside such a legendary formation."
 GGR_the_chicken_neck_desc:0 "Murmansk and Karelia are the closest regions belonging to our enemy. By starting a low-intensity conflict, we'll be able to test their willingness and readiness to fight. Should they prove weak, we may be able to win this war before it even starts!\n\nRussia is like a poor, defenceless chicken running in the farmyard, and we shall be the ones to wring its neck, ready to be served for dinner!"
 GGR_undoing_their_efforts_desc:0 "Despite twenty years of constant internal strife, it seems the Russians are still as adept at the art of war as they were under their bolshevik predecessor. This only proves that the Slavs are nothing more than capable slaves, only good to be bled dry for the glory of the Aryan race.\n\nWith our victory in the border war, we can safely integrate the regions of Murmansk and Karelia into our ever-growing Reich, and use them as staging ground for the true invasion! The Russians must be already trembling at the prospect of facing our full might..."
 GGR_the_finnish_return_desc:0 "Despite Murmansk and Karelia being owned by the Russians, their population is Finnish in majority. As such, simply integrating it into Reichskommissariat Moskowien would only bring problem, as it would encourage the Finnish to revolt.\n\nWith this in mind, it's much more convenient to include the regions into a land inhabited by their brothers. Not only would the local population be much happier about it, but it would also cement our relationship with our comrades-in-arms."
 GGR_expanding_moskowien_desc:0 "Murmansk and Karelia may be inhabited mostly by Finnish, but the territory is clearly part of Russia, and integrating them into another territorial entity would only create logistical problems. Therefore, it's much more convenient to simply integrate it into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, and let the larger administration oversee its pacification."
 GGR_our_efforts_undone_desc:0 "Impossible! How could we lose such an easy battle! This can't be, there MUST be something, someone, behind our defeat against the Russian rabble! We need to do something about this, and quick, or we'll risk endangering the entire offensive!\n\nOn one hand, we can blame the entire débacle on the general who led the contingent: he won't be happy about it, and it will cause frictions between officers and troops, but we would save face. On the other, we can try to learn from our mistakes: we'll face a humiliating backlash at home, but we'll improve our situation and ensure we can win in the long run, or at least that's what we hope..."
 GGR_save_face_desc:0 "It's evident that this humiliating defeat is to be entirely blamed on the commanding officer! He displayed utter incompetence, and made several blunders, both tactical and strategic, that resulted in the defeat of our troops! For this reason, he shall be relieved from all command roles within the army until we find a suitable deployment for such a wretch!\n\nNot only that, but we'll make a propaganda enemy out of him! Not enough to start a conflict with the High Command and the militarists, but still enough to prevent him from ever reaching important positions within the army."
 GGR_learn_from_our_mistakes_desc:0 "While it would be so much easier to simply blame everything on the officer in command of the operation, we can't ignore the fact that the initial offensive was marred by several blunders in both logistical and tactical organization.\n\nSeveral of our units were under equipped, and they didn't receive their orders due to delays in the radio stations, which were overwhelmed by the sheer number of ongoing transmissions and failed to properly connect each call to the right unit.\n\nIf we want to win this war, we need to learn from our mistakes, and return there stronger than ever before!"
 GGR_remember_the_winter_war_desc:0 "With Finland in control of Murmansk and Karelia, and the Russian warlords still divided, this war is already over before even beginning! However, we can't be rash: in order to avoid unnecessary casualties, we need to approach our enemy carefully and have our backs covered.\n\nTo address this, we have two solutions: on one hand, we can reach an agreement with the Finnish, and have them grant us military access to their railways and port facilities, greatly helping our logistical situation. On the other, we can strengthen Reichskommissariat Moskowien and ensure that the Russians already under our authority don't stab us in the back at the first chance..."
 GGR_keep_your_friends_close_desc:0 "Our allies in the North are our best bet against the Russians. By sending them guns and other smaller concessions, we can make sure they won't ever protest if we use their land as a staging ground for the invasion.\n\nThis time, we'll be the ones striking from the frozen North, and the Russians will flee in terror! How's that, General Winter?"
 GGR_masters_of_the_arctic_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our access to the port of Murmansk, we can improve it to house a warfleet and the convoys needed for a naval invasion! While we don't necessarily have to follow this route - and indeed, the waters will most likely be frozen, preventing any actual landing from ever happening - it will be a threat nonetheless, and the foolish Russians will be forced to divert several units to protect hundreds of miles of useless, frozen nothing!\n\nWith their forces divided, we can take our time and choose the most effective way to crush these vermins!"
 GGR_and_your_enemies_closer_desc:0 "In the end, our best bet against the Russians is Reichskommissariat Moskowien. Not only is it the logistical crossroad for the entire operations - which means that a revolt would make Fall Rot collapse on itself immediately - but most of the Russian levies we have deployed come from there.\n\nIt is imperative, therefore, that we strengthen the Reichskommissariat, and ensure the local authorities have enough men and guns to keep everything under control. With our backs covered, we can launch our offensive without having to worry about our rear!"
 GGR_ensure_russian_loyalty_desc:0 "The Russians employed within our army are more numerous than they are loyal. With several fighting units, and a large part of the logistical machine being Russian, a native revolt in Moskowien due to racial conflicts, or dissatisfaction with the treatment they receive while under our command, would cripple the war effort with disastrous consequences.\n\nAs much as we loathe to even think about it, we might need to increase their pay and living conditions so that they have at least some reason to remain loyal to us. Of course, we can always let them understand what happens to those who betray the master race, with the help of a generous number of summary executions..."
 GGR_the_army_is_ready_desc:0 "After extensive preparations and a renewed recruitment drive, the Wehrmacht is ready to launch the offensive! Our panzerdivisionen are eager to trample the Russians under their threads once more, and both regular soldiers and mercenaries have been extensively trained and equipped for the coming war.\n\nThe time to blow the horns is almost here! As soon as our agents are done with their operation, and the Russian morale has been sufficiently lowered, we shall bear the eagle and the swastika to the Slavs, to rule as their masters for a thousand years and more!"
 GGR_renew_terror_bombings_desc:0 "As long as the Luftwaffe fulfilled its admirable duty in bombing the Russian desolation, the warlords were kept submitted. With the end of the bombings due to the Bürgerkrieg, the warlords began building up their strength once again, and eventually began unifying through means either peaceful or violent, giving birth to the monster we are now facing.\n\nIn order to counter the bolshevik menace, and let these savages understand that the sky is OUR somain, and ours only, we shall resume the terror bombings over the entirety of Russia. By dynamite or by napalm, the Slavs will bend to their master, one way or the other."
 GGR_send_in_the_firebrands_desc:0 "Among the Russians living in Moskowien are many who support our ideology. Like Count Vlad of Transylvania, who sent Turkish prisoners infected with the plague back to their masters to spread disease and panic among the invaders, we shall plant agitators, firebrands and terrorists in the territories belonging to our enemies, ready to turn the unsuspecting populace to our cause, or sabotage their war effort.\n\nThose Russians are so foolish to think that all of their kin are on their side, or cruelly oppressed. While they might indeed be true on the latter, the former is still very much up for discussion, and our generous gift will surely be a VERY convincing argument..."
 GGR_coordinated_rebellion_desc:0 "Russia has been divided for more than two decades, and many of those warlords had - or still have - deeply conflicting political ideologies. This means that there's lots of fertile ground to seed dissent and foment rebellion: by coordinating the agents we have sent there and having them infiltrate already-existing opposition movements, it will be easy to set up well-timed uprisings and other disturbances.\n\nEfen in the case that they don't manage to completely topple the enemy government, they'll still provide a useful source of distraction, forcing them to divert troops to guard supply lines and sensitive targets from terrorist attacks or raids."
 GGR_fear_campaign_desc:0 "We can't limit ourselves to destroy their infrastructure and industry. If we want to prevail quickly and easily, we need to destroy their very hopes and dreams of resisting our advance!\n\nTo address this, our bombers will drop not only their explosive payload, but also leaflets written in Russian where the common folk will be able to know with exact precision the fate awaiting them should they resist.\n\nOf course, they will all share the same fate of servitude whether they fight or not, but they don't need to know it, do they?"
 GGR_total_demoralization_desc:0 "Our propaganda campaign is already showing its first results, but we can't rest on our laurels now! We need to increase our pressure on the Russian home front, and for this we shall send even more airplanes, with dozens of different payloads: be it with gunpowder or paper, we shall strike directly at the heart of the bolshevik fools!"
 GGR_their_people_are_weak_desc:0 "Finally, our efforts have paid, and the Russian people is weaker than ever. The wretches live in terror of the next bombing run, just after they thought they would never have to endure such torture any longer: they run and hide like rats, and spend their restless nights in abject fear, for they know what awaits them at the end of the war.\n\nThe time has come to reap the fruits of our hard labor! As soon as the army is ready, we shall plunge deep into the Russian heartland, just as we did twenty years ago!"
 GGR_across_the_east_and_far_away_desc:0 "To the pitiful warlords of the Russian wastes! The hour of reckoning has come! The Reich of a Thousand Years shall take its place at the top of the world, as it was before, and as it forever shall be!\n\nSurrender and be spared, to live your lives in the servitude as all inferior races deserve, or fight and die to the last! There will be no quarter, no armistice, no mercy! The Wehrmacht shall be unleashed, and snow shall tinge red with blood!\n\nWir ziehen in den Krieg bis zum Sieg!"
 GGR_the_first_domino_desc:0 "Even though we won twice against the Russians in the last two decades, the harsh weather - especially winter - reaped many victims among our forces both times. With modern technologies and synthetic materials, we can easily provide proper winter clothing for all our forces at a fraction of the cost it would have taken during the last war.\n\nBy supplying our men with warm, comfortable war attire, we shall deny the Russian rabble their only advantage, and prove, once and for all, that not even General Winter can hope to defeat the Reich!"
 GGR_winter_clothing_drive_desc:0 "Fighting in the snow isn't just a matter of keeping yourself warm. ice, snow and low temperatures provide a wide array of logistical, tactical and strategic challenges that, if not properly addressed, will result in a humiliating defeat.\n\nBy training our troops in winter warfare and the use of weapons in extreme conditions, and teaching our mechanics and pilots how to keep their vehicles in optimal state even when the fuel in their tanks freezes, we shall prevail as we did in the past!"
 GGR_ice_training_desc:0 "Our invasion of Russia is like a great game of domino. All the pieces have been painstakingly set into place, but for this reason it is imperative that the first piece falls in the proper way.\n\nWestern Russia is the first domino, and our invasion won't be able to proceed to the next stage until all of it has been secured. To this end, we need to occupy the entirety of the territories belonging to the Western warlords: our men need to understand the difficulty of the task, and feel pride for being the ones who will ensure the swastika rises from Moscow to the Pacific Ocean!"
 GGR_loot_the_factories_desc:0 "After what now is Reichskommissariat Moskowien, the "free" Western Russia is the most industrialized area among the territories belonging to the former Soviet Union. Such a wealth of industrial power can't be wasted, and should be properly exploited for our invasion!\n\nIn order to ensure our troops receive all the supplies they need, we shall seize as many factories as we can before the bolshevik rabble can evacuate or sabotage them, and divert production towards the war effort. If this can't be done, we'll simply tear the entire building apart and bring everything to Germany!"
 GGR_expand_the_reichskommissariat_desc:0 "As the Russians West of the Urals share a mostly uniform culture, it would be most advantageous to integrate the newly-conquered territories into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, whose experienced officials are best suited for such a task.\n\nWith their tried methods to properly rule over the Russian rabble, they won't have problems overseeing the pacification and subsequent integration of Western Russia into the larger Reich, ensuring all meet their production quota, and partisans don't hinder the war effort."
 GGR_fight_the_insurgency_desc:0 "As expected, civilian partisans, deserters from the Russian armies and even bandits have started striking against occupation garrisons and unprotected supply lines. While the occupied territories are still under direct military control and waiting for integration into Reichskommissariat Moskowien, we need to act to crush the rebels before they can hinder the war effort.\n\nBy deploying special troops to the most troublesome regions, and showing the wretches that we aren't above retaliating against the civilian population, even their families and loved ones - no, ESPECIALLY their families and loved ones - we should be able to keep them under control until proper police forces come to patrol the roads and cities."
 GGR_find_some_friends_desc:0 "Of course, brute force won't suffice by itself in keeping these insolent inferiors in their place. Our agents have already started to look for potential... allies in this struggle, and they report satisfying results: as we advance, they will spin a thick web of ideological deserters, paid sycophants, traitorous politicians, informers and many, many others.\n\nWhen we leave for our next target, these native collaborators will ensure the resistance is kept under control, by both offering the common people an acceptable face to our iron-fisted rule, and selling their comrades in the opposition to the Orpo before they can put any of their plans into action!"
 GGR_searching_in_perm_desc:0 "Despite being Slavs, the Aryan Brotherhood was mainly comprised of ardent supporters of national socialism. By looking among their ranks for potential recruits, we can set up a loyal - or at least, partially so - paramilitary force entirely made up of Russians at a fraction of the cost required to form a proper police force!\n\nAlso, should they fail in their duty towards the master race, or prove a disappointment in other ways, we can always send them into the slave camps and replace them with professionals... Waste not, want not!"
 GGR_reestablish_the_roa_desc:0 "The Russkaja Osvoboditel'naja Armija (ROA), or "Russian Liberation Army", was a commendable effort to sow division and strife among the Russians, by providing deserters and collaborators a banner to flock to. In the end, however, it proved useless, and Vlasov betrayed us to establish his own petty realm to rule as a warlord.\n\nSince the experiment was still promising, we shall re-establish the ROA, but under a new management. We'll only choose loyal officers from Moskowien, and they shall be properly kept under control by the Abwehr to ensure they don't start having strange thoughts as their predecessors did..."
 GGR_rush_to_the_urals_desc:0 "With Western Russia under total control, we now need to strike at the warlords in control of the Urals. It will be a tough battle, as the wretches not only had the time to prepare for war while we were crushing their brothers, but they also enjoy the protection of the Urals themselves: tall, impervious and heavily fortified, these mountains will prove a difficult challenge even for our best units.\n\nThe Oberkommando has devised two possible solutions to this problem. The first is to send in more fresh troops from the Vaterland to storm the mountain fortresses, a costly but effective solution. The second is to establish Russian penal battalions and force them to attack the fortifications or face execution: while much cheaper in both money and German lives wasted, this solution is also riskier as there is a higher chance of desertion or even revolt..."
 GGR_do_it_ourselves_desc:0 "The Russians have proved time and again their mettle, and for this reason we can't trust them any longer. We'll break the Urals with German strength and blood, no one can stand against us!\n\nBy initiating a new conscription campaign at home, we'll surely be able to fill any manpower need we might have."
 GGR_all_russian_penal_batallions_desc:0 "Spilling German blood amidst the Ural peaks is a total waste, especially when we can achieve the same result by spilling Russian blood. As the last wars taught us, there's always too much Russian blood left to spill: there must be, if they can repopulate so quickly after suffering such losses twice in two decades...\n\nIn order to take the mountain forts, we shall form Russian penal battalions by conscripting wretches taken from prisons and slave camps. They'll have a simple choice: almost certain death at the hands of their own kin up in the snowy Urals, or certain death at our hands if they refuse. If they survive, there's always another fort to take, or another minefield we can't spare deminers for...\n\nAfter all, we are just copying their own tactics: as Zhukov said, "If there is a minefield, the infantry will advance as if there wasn't a minefield"
 GGR_redevelop_the_roads_desc:0 "Advancing towards Siberia is a difficult task for our logistical department. Russian infrastructure is already underdeveloped enough, but the situation has worsened after the bombing campaign and the fighting: now, most railroads are fully unusable, and the majority of the roads are covered in craters, almost all bridges cut to prevent us from advancing.\n\nIf we want to ensure our troops receive all the supplies they need for the coming campaign, then a concerted effort is needed to bring the infrastructure back to working order. We shall pave our own way to the final victory!"
 GGR_take_the_people_desc:0 "With the occupation of Western Russia now completed, we can start establishing a proper exploitation structure. All those who fought against us, and the ones who refused to submit even though they remained neutral, shall be enslaved to the master race and put into camps where they'll spend the rest of their lives toiling for the Reich and understanding the depth of their mistake.\n\nWith the new extraction and production facilities, our war machine will be unstoppable! The inferiors should find comfort in the fact that their sacrifice will serve to elevate the Reich to even higher reaches of power and might!"
 GGR_rebuild_the_aa_line_desc:0 "The Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line was the original target of Unternehmen Barbarossa. A line cutting Russia from North to South along the Volga river, it was to be extensively fortified and serve as a buffer against any attempt at either invading or bombing Germany from the East. However, due to the economy collapse in the Fifties, it was left almost undefended and subsequently lost to the Second Russian War. Even though we managed to repel the offensive, the border was redrawn nearer to Moskowien.\n\nWith our offensive triumphant, we can now reverse this shame! The A-A Line shall be rebuilt, a stalwart sentinel forever guarding Germania from her enemies! The first step is to rebuild the forts and trenches, a sufficient measure for now as the Russians don't possess the means to properly threaten complex fortification systems. In due time, we shall complete the work, and the line will stand for a thousand years!"
 GGR_eyes_to_the_steppes_desc:0 "The steppes of Central Asia are a potential source of problems. With their bandits and revanchist warlords, any Reichskommissariat we establish in Russia will suffer incursions and raids: the best solution is, of course, crushing these degenerates before they can pose any actual threat!\n\nBy relenting our offensive against Eastern Russia, and concentrating our efforts on the Central Asian warlords, we'll be able to resume our offensive without any hindrance coming from our exposed flank."
 GGR_man_vs_machine_desc:0 "Most of the steppe bandits rely on hit-and-run tactics, where cavalry forces, supported by few motorized units, strike at the enemy from the flanks or the rear, steal any useful loot, and then retreat before the foe can retaliate. This will prove to be a hindrance, and requires an adequate response.\n\nBy bolstering our mechanized corps, even our basic infantry will be far superior to anything they can throw at us! The nomads of the steppes have no mechanized forces, and even should they have any, they'll probably be a small percentage of their total army, which means they'll be mercilessly crushed by our technologically and numerically superior regiments!"
 GGR_torch_it_all_desc:0 "Central Asia is mostly worthless in the larger picture. Bereft of any meaningful industrial base or even resource wealth, it would be useless to waste men and reichsmarks to establish a proper garrison and administration.\n\nHowever, what we can do is to strip this useless land of anything worth reusing and relocating the machinery near Moskowien, where we'll be able to properly exploit it without the need for constant watch..."
 GGR_dont_look_back_desc:0 "With our duty done here, we can leave Central Asia without looking back. When the rest of Russia is properly dealt with, we'll return and establish a proper Reichskommissariat, but for now this land is best left on its own.\n\nIf we're lucky, the wretches will even kill each other on their own without any outside help! This would considerably speed up our plans to integrate the region..."
 GGR_finish_them_off_desc:0 "With most of Russia under our control, we can now launch the final offensive against the Siberian warlords! We need to be careful about the extreme weather and the logistics, but once we have prepared, our enemy will crumble easily.\n\nAfter all, Siberia is a depopulated region without any meaningful industrial development. Their army will melt like snow in front of the Wehrmacht, and their hopes will be crushed like brittle glass by the hammer of the Reich!"
 GGR_sow_the_seeds_desc:0 "With most of Russia under our control, the few, pitiful remnant are cowering in fear of our warmachine, like the cowards they are! It's time to launch the last propaganda initiative, where we'll try to convince as many as possible to desert and either join our cause, or simply stand idle as the last vestiges of bolshevism are utterly crushed.\n\nEven if they don't revolt against their commanders, every deserter is one less Russian to fight! Not that there are still many left ready to fight..."
 GGR_national_socialism_stands_triumphant_desc:0 "Siberia was home to several movement sympathizing with national socialism. By defeating the last remnants of the Soviet Union, we have undoubtedly proved the superiority of our ideology compared to the corrupt scions of Marx and Engels!\n\nIf we play our cards right, we can motivate several such movements to join our cause. While they'll never be proper Aryans, they'll make fine collaborators when we integrate these lands into the great Reich..."
 GGR_drive_them_into_the_sea_desc:0 "The time for the final push has come! Our panzerdivisionen shall rout the pitiful leftovers of the Russian warlords towards the ocean, where they won't have anywhere else to retreat! Let's see how many will be ready to jump into the sea and commit the ultimate sacrifice for their ideology!\n\nI have the suspicion that very, very few will. After all, bolsheviks are known for their cowardice..."
 GGR_threaten_the_japanese_desc:0 "With our recent expansion, we have come to border the Japanese at Vladivostok. Our former allies might protest, and ask for their former possession back - after all, when they ceded it to the Russians they didn't expect us to conquer it - but now it's too late to ask for its return!\n\nAll of Russia has been conquered by the German might, and no one will stand against it! Perhaps stationing a couple nuclear missiles near the border will keep the Japanese in check, so that they don't go ahead of themselves, won't it?"
 GGR_the_end_of_the_rus_desc:0 "Victory at last! With the complete conquest of Russia, the German Reich proves once more its might against those who once dared to stand defiant before the glory of the eagle and the swastika! The Russian people is no more, either assimilated, enslaved or driven into the wilderness to fight like the rats they are!\n\nA grand triumph shall be held in Germania! All the military leaders shall be present alongside the Führer for this momentous occasion, where the power of the Reich shall be exposed for all to see! Heil das Reich! Heil Germania! Heil Göring!"

Their only saving grace is that they have a stockpile of nuclear munitions that they aren't afraid to launch. Cracking the 'Ordensstadt' will be challenging, but well worth the effort. Next on our list is the Empire of the Rising Sun; the cursed and traitorous Japanese. Although their army and navy is large and strong, they are spread thin trying to maintain their stranglehold in Asia; something we may be able to exploit. Last but not least....\n\n America. Land of the Free, and Home of the Brave, or so they tell themselves. In reality, their only saving grace is the two oceans that have protected them from our might for over two decades! With our capabilities now, however, focing the Americans to truely bend the knee to us is a not just a pipedream, but a totally feasible task.\n\n The battles ahead will be fierce and deadly. Yet, we have full faith in our warriors. One last effort, and the Reich will be left standing as the sole superpower on the planet! We will come out on top, and we will bring fortunes and glory to the Reich!It's time. We will prepare to attack the big 3 (burgundy, the USA and Japan). Germany is about to face the hardest challenge it has faced in its history...  but the Heer shall pull through!"

The terrain Siberia is inhospitable and we would need to build supporting infrastructure, but is the most direct route to Japan's holdings.\n\nAlternatively, we could surprise the world and make our approach south, through Iran and India.

GGR_review_the_fleet:0 "Review the Fleet"
GGR_review_the_fleet_desc:0 "Once upon a time, before Hitler had even joined the National Socialist movement, the Kaiserliche Marine was the pride of Germany, and the envy of the world. Indeed, it was so powerful that the weak, pitiful west forced us to dismantle it after the shame of the Great War, for fear of us returning to greatness. Of course, this did not stop us from rebuilding our fleet in the glory days of the Reich, restoring the Kriegsmarine to heights unseen by even the Empire. By the end of the Second World War, the German fleet was among the strongest on earth, with the masses of U-Boat wolfpacks becoming the bane of our enemies and the surface fleet, backed by the power of our battleships, spreading fear across those who opposed us. For a time, it seemed, the old imperial dream of naval dominance could be achieved.\n\nHowever, as of late, the Kriegsmarine has been, if not treading water, sliding backwards in its ability. The ships and submarines rust in their harbors, underfunded and undercrewed. The Kriegsmarine in general has become the black sheep of the Heer, constantly overlooked in favor of the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht's needs. Nowadays, the Kriegsmarine is in a state of disrepair, slowly decaying. This cannot stand, especially with some of the Führer's more grandiose plans requiring a strong navy to succeed.\n\nTwo schools of thought have emerged in the Admiralty, each butting against each other in a constant battle. The first school emphasizes the need for battleships in the modern age, arguing that with simple renovations and fixes, the sheer power a battleship brings would dominate both the American and Japanese fleets. The second school pushes heavily to scrap our old battleships, instead pivoting into the new world of carrier-based doctrine.\n\nThe decision falls to Göring now, who must decide- shall the old, tried and tested battleship prevail, or will it fall to the modern competition of the aircraft carrier?"

The process to gut the old kings of the sea, painful as it is, must be begun now. That way, with both the weight of maintenance and the profits of the scrap, we can begin production on our new line of carriers, and make a tidy profit in the end. Though this process will strike deep at the heart of any true German patriot, it must be begun now, or else we will find ourselves unready and unable to fight when the time comes."

While this plan does not try to save the battleships in their current forms, what it proposes is almost as shocking and daring as the original change.\n\nThe plan, obviously refined and rewritten multiple times, details the potential opportunity we currently have to refit our battleships into carriers, instead of scrapping the old hulks and building new ships. While the process of converting our battleships into carriers is certainly a costly one, the plan emphasizes both the practical and overall benefits of such a change. Practically, the plan will allow us to keep some of the old hulls around as bases to new carriers, instead of being forced to fully scrap each of our relics. Overall, these retrofits would give us the necessary experience needed to build full carriers.\n\nWhile scrapping the battleships is certainly the more economical choice, the possibility of repurposing our old prides of the fleet into a modern day wonder of Germany has captivated the Führer. With the flick of his pen and a word to his advisors, the plan has changed, and those battleships that once seemed to be reaching the end of the line have been granted a new lease on life."

In such a situation, it seems the risk is just too great.\n\nTherefore, as painful as it is, we will have to dismantle and scrap some of the Kriegsmarine's greatest ships. Though we have tried to save and restore them, it seems that the years of neglect and disrepair have taken their toll. Even now, scrapping ships take the first sections of these kings of the sea apart, tearing old traditions away piece by piece.\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, however, and the silver lining in this particular cloud is quite comforting.

As Hitler worked so tirelessly to defeat the Royal Navy, so shall we work tirelessly to defeat the Americans and Japanese.

The plan is for this tidal wave of land troops to sweep away any Burgundian resistance like a broom sweeping up dust, pushing the momentum so that any SS forces that survive our spearin the north will be swallowed by this devastating tide. This force will naturally be slower than its counterpart, but it hardly needs any extra equipment when the terrain will be incredibly easy to navigate in the center of the French lands. France has seen the devastation that massed infantry and artillery could cause decades ago, and we aim to replicate that feat against these traitors."

On the orders of Generalfeldmarschall Schörner himself, a dedicated corps of soldiers with extra training in landing operations has been established and deployed to the Isles. This 'Seakorps' as it has been dubbed by the general staff would normally not be terribly effective given its relatively small size. However, this unit is not intended to carry out the war single-handedly.\n\nThe main mission that will be presented to these brave warriors is this: establish a foothold in the Normandy and Calais regions before advancing in two columns, one to secure the coastal ports and the other to advance inland. Eventually these columns will make contact with the rest of our forces, and we will have a massive pocket of the Burgundian forces ready to be liquidated."

They must be prepared to receive the Heer as if it was a long expected guest. Roads must be repaired, civilians in border regions must be evacuated quietly, and supply depots must be established.

After the normal bickering about who would have the honor of leading the charge against the traitorous state Generalfeldmarschal Shcorner, likely tired of the arguments, proposed a solution that was agreeable to all. An ad hoc kampfgruppe of corps size would be derived from the units of several other formations and would use its less formal structure to better make split-second decisions in the field. This proposal was generally well taken and Schörner drew up the orders for the creation of 'Korpsgruppe Kurtz' right then and there."

His finger gestured between two of the largest blocks on the map before he leaned back again with a wobble, satisfied, and took yet another sip from his glass.\n\n"This is where we will find our allies."\n\nThe figure to his right stared down the bridge of his nose through his reading glasses doing his best to ignore the winestain that formed a new landmass in the Atlantic. "Haiti and Cuba?". Schörner's lip curled upwards into a sneer. "Forgive me, mein Führer, but while they would provide excellent staging posts for further operations their cooperation is unnecessary - and I expect not forthcoming. To notify them of our intentions would be counterproductive in excess." \n\n"Have a little faith, Ferdinand. I am told the Haitian regime has taken great inspiration from National Socialism - no doubt they will be overjoyed for assistance against America and Dominica." \n\nSchörner resisted the urge to remind Göring that Dominica was a completely different place to the Dominican Republic - with the amount of wine the Führer has consumed it was unlikely he would understand. "And Castro? The man is an ardent Communist. If he chose to work with us he would either be a fool or a backstabber." \n\nGöring seemed to be deliberately ignoring him, and had already begun writing a letter with a wobbling hand. "You have no head for diplomacy, Ferdinand. Certainly we could invade all of the Caribbean, but a little goodwill goes a long way." \n\nSchörner simmered on the inside. On some days, he was sure the Führer only played these little games to spite him and the other militarists, a way of feeling in control once again, but on other days the almost insanity of the man seemed genuine. So be it he thought, let the Führer dream of being a diplomat. He would begin drawing up the backup plans."

As soon as they laid eyes on Goering, they made the faces of children in a candy shop or of men facing their reckoning with God. Hell, they were probably resisting the temptation to kneel on the floor and grovel.

He was not paying these strange men much attention. "Oh? Oh, yes, of course. It's my pleasure." The two military men beside Goering give him a look that was more exasperated than angry, as they were used to and perfectly happy with their supposed leader's apathy and numbness by this point.\nRemer got straight to business. "Gentlemen, you have certain paramilitary organizations who might be willing to support our cause against your degenerate government, correct?"\n "Yessir!" Replied the second-in-command Gordon Mohr.

Let us discuss some plans we have for the assassination of the US president," said Remer, who was effectively controlling the meeting by now. These were some of the most eccentric men any of the three Germans had ever seen, but there was no harm in getting them to do some dirty work for the Reich if they were so eager to help.\n At the end of the meeting, Mohr humbly asked, "Mein Führer, if I may make one small request of you. I have a letter from one of our fellow sympathizers, Father Charles Coughlin that he has asked I give to you to read. It would be another wonderful honour."\n "Of course," replied a distant Goering, almost forgetting to reach out and take the letter. "I will gladly read it.""

By mere chance, however, the tunnel was fifty meters too long, and so it had blown up the façade of the Treasury Building. Sadly, most of the suspects were killed in the pursuit, and nothing was found on the bodies"\n\nMost people in the room, including [GetName], knew that the madman in Germania had something to do with it, but without proof there was nothing to be done about it.

How to spend it had never been in question; the Staatsoper Germania had premiered a new run of Weber's Der Freischutz, and the Fuhrer was determined to attend the show come Hell or high water. Why, even if Schörner were to barge in and announce that they had entered into war with America or Japan, Göring would not be dissuaded. He needed this as a man in a desert needs water.\n\nBundled up in multiple layers for disguise and accompanied only by the most discrete and trusted of his personal guard, the man who ruled over all of Europe and much of Asia and Africa did not look the part. He was careful to avoid the gazes of any of the other opera goers, as even with all of his efforts to disguise he was still the most known man in the Reich, if not the world. After a few stressful encounters necessary to procure his seat, Göring was finally able to take a place in the most prestigious of the viewing boxes. Now all that was left was to relax, and immerse himself in the show.\n\nThat was his plan at any rate, but it was not destined to be. The performance, as expected of the renowned theater, was as terrific as Göring could ever remember it being; its quality was not what haunted his mind as the lines of "O diese Sonne" ran through his head. No, it was the dawning realization on the part of the Fuhrer that he, for all his power and prestige, was in no better a situation than young Max. Those damned militarists, Schörner, Remer, and the rest, they were the demonic Zamiel who had given him the magic bullets that had granted him such success. When, the thought flashed into his mind, would it come time for the seventh bullet to be fired? And what would be its terrible price? He shuddered silently as unbidden images of hellfire and death presented themselves to him in an inescapable montage of doom. The magic of the night was gone, and the Fuhrer collapsed into a deep sense of fear as he heard the chorus utter the line that had always been able to move him before, only now in quite a different sense."

There have been some dissenting voices on this topic, as our only major experience with naval landings was some 20 years ago during Operation Sea Lion - an operation that cost countless German lives. The Führer has confidence in the Wehrmacht's capabilities, however; we have come a long way already, defeating far more significant challenges than this.

Even the most stupid, recalcitrant of races would naturally learn a thing or two about fighting there after such a long time. Though serious construction efforts might be hampered by the terrain, an effort must be made to reinforce strategic chokepoints with bunkers and set up both anti-air batteries and radar stations on hilltops.

Despite our numerical superiority and extraordinary discipline, no German soldier can hope to survive his boat sinking a kilometer out to sea, or topple a cliffside bunker with his bare hands. Instead of attempting to overwhelm the defenders with wave after wave of assault boats, we must ensure our men are as prepared as they can be. The Kriegsmarine, likewise, will need to bring every gun they have to bear on the shores of Kleinasien to save as many German lives as possible.

Syria's industry is further afield, but still an easy target provided that our bombers are able to cross Anatolia unscathed. We predict that Turkey has little enough industry that a bombing campaign of only a few days should see their arms production grind to a halt.

The generals warn of caution, however; the mountain ranges and narrow passes will largely negate our numerical advantage, forcing us to rely on more focused breakthrough forces or find some way to circumvent such obstacles. Despite their origin in the barbarous steppes of Central Asia, the Turks are a mountain people through and through; we must be wary of any tricks they might have picked up in the past few centuries. This is relatively unfamiliar territory for the Wehrmacht, and the Luftwaffe's ability to provide air support will be stymied.

Every soldier worth his salt recognises the importance of logistics and proper use of available supplies. That said, the Caucasus mountains are filled with extremely tight bottlenecks, and there are plenty of places where supplies might be misplaced or stolen by mountain-dwelling partisans. It might be worth focusing our plans proper maintenance of supply lines, and on maximizing the use that our men get out of their supplies.

They are some of the toughest, hardest and most elite troops in the world; they faced down tremendous odds in some of the harshest battles of the Second World War, and lived to establish their legend. We have just the right targets in mind: beyond the Caucasus, there are relatively flat areas in Armenia and along the coastline, where they could be dropped in significant numbers along with enough supplies and heavy weapons to hold out until the rest of our forces push through the mountains.

We know that no matter what we do, crossing the Caucasus will be a bloody affair; maybe we should just bite the bullet and accept our casualty estimates as they are. When confronted with the possible damage to morale the troops might suffer, the same generals who suggested this strategy noted our massive reserves of Pervitin, a combat stimulant left over from the last war. Pervitin helped many pilots, tankists and Panzergrenadiers through weeks of tough fighting, keeping them sharp and awake for days on end.

We, as the defenders of Europe - and those foreign peoples with old ties to Europe - declare that the autonomy of the Syrians will be enshrined in our war goals for Operation Gertrud.

True, they might regard our own nation as a land of heathen devilry, but they are so distant and radical that they could never pose a threat to a superpower like the Reich. Funding radical militants who wish to see the end of the Turkish state and a return to tradition would serve us well; far removed from the borders of Germany, they will never be a problem in the future. These groups are savage, bloodthirsty and obsessively puritanical, imbuing them with a fighting spirit that compensates for their disadvantages against the Turks.

As such, Kleinasien is not to be treated as a defeated nation, but as a militarized zone permanently occupied by our troops; maintaining order will be difficult there, but a thorough beating should put an end to any ambitions of Turkish independence.

To this end, our occupation forces need a large boost in terms of supplies and manpower. More divisions can be shipped across the Bosphorus as needed, but the nature of Kleinasien also necessitates the construction of better infrastructure; the Turks have done a poor job of modernizing their nation in the past few decades.

Still, their fear can be exploited; with the strength of the Wehrmacht on full display during Operation Gertrud, their meager military must be quivering in their collective boots!

Now that we have a border with Italy's possessions, we should move a number of divisions into the area to conduct open exercises, aggressive aerial patrols and general displays of force.

Now, with the Reich stronger than ever and the Wehrmacht pushed to its very limits, he plots against his commander-in-chief and thereby the entirety of the German people. Should he succeed in overthrowing our government, the Reich will surely be plunged into an abyss from which it will never escape - a deathtrap of deranged militarism and senseless violence.\n\nGöring must rise to the challenge one last time. For the Reich and its glorious conquests to be secured in perpetuity, the Monster in Uniform must be destroyed along with each and every deviant traitor who would follow him."
 GGR_donitz_shadow_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine, even after being brought to heel, was never a friend to Göring. Grand Admiral Dönitz's shadow still hangs over our great fleet, tainting it with Bormannite conservatism. While the Führer now finds himself facing his own erstwhile militarist allies, there are still far too many questions about the political nature of the Kriegsmarine's leadership. It is unlikely that Schörner has brought any of them into his camp, but if their loyalty is not secured they might choose to remain neutral in the power struggle, just as they did during the Bürgerkrieg. Still, if the Führer can demonstrate the validity of his new, dynamic form of National Socialist conservatism, they might be reined in and their mighty guns directed to his benefit."
 GGR_can_we_trust_the_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The Führer must have his navy on-side to maintain German power projection and overseas capabilities, no matter what comes. Quiet negotiations shall begin; the Abwehr will be dispatched to probe the officer corps for any Schörnerite presence or plans of disloyal neutrality. Their loyalty is easily worth whatever paltry concessions they might demand of the Führer in exchange for deeper political cooperation. Once their political position is ascertained, our strategy for handling them can be adjusted accordingly. They certainly can't be any harder to manage than the militarists ever were."
 GGR_find_the_trustworthy_desc:0 "The struggle between the Führer and his treasonous field marshal is not yet common knowledge outside the shadowed halls of the Reich Chancellery. The average German on the street knows nothing of the coming storm, and the Kriegsmarine, always at sea, knows even less. Of course, this is precisely how the Führer would have it; the fewer individuals are compromised with knowledge of the divide in the Reich's leadership, the better. Care must be taken in our present dealings with the Kriegsmarine so that they learn nothing more than they must. Only those few reliable admirals with a vested interest in Göring's success should be brought on board."
 GGR_we_know_who_we_can_trust_desc:0 "Namely, not the Kriegsmarine. During the Bürgerkrieg, they fled to Crimea, showing that the only colors they flew were their own. They might have professed loyalty to the Reich above all else, but how could we ever believe that excuse when Göring was clearly the only legitimate Führer in the first place? The Kriegsmarine has been insubordinate for years, dithering at every order and not even bothering to maintain the correct political standards for its leadership. The only appropriate solution is to cut out this cancer infecting the Reich - purge the ranks, from the admiralty down to the lowliest e-boat crew! They will be of little use against Schörner anyway, so who will miss those sea-rats?"
 GGR_an_airforce_with_a_navy_desc:0 "Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine will always be secondary to the Heer and the illustrious Luftwaffe. With the old guard and unreliable crews purged, we should begin the long-overdue process of reforming our naval command to correctly represent its position. We have had quite enough of salt-worn old men and disloyal, drunk sailors. Naturally, the most logical choice here is to put men who have experience in combat, organization and administration in charge, but there is currently a dearth of skilled seamen for some reason. Thankfully, the Führer knows plenty of talented and politically reliable men in the Luftwaffe who are due for promotions! These men will form a new board to replace the admiralty and ensure the swift reorganization and - more importantly - loyalty of our reborn Kriegsmarine."
 GGR_revive_the_freikorps_desc:0 "The Freikorps - nearly five decades have passed since their glory days, but the saviors of the Reich live on in the German cultural consciousness. Their victories over communism and the Jewry were forever immortalized by Hitler, and their deeds remain the bedrock of our National Socialist traditions. Freikorps membership, or descent from a Freikorps veteran, remains a marker of prestige in our society. None would question us, therefore, if we were to announce the reformation and formalization of this old paramilitary. To ordinary citizens, it would appear perfectly innocuous - a means by which to prepare as many people as possible for war and allow old soldiers to maintain their martial pride. To the Führer, however, it will be the largest and most well-trained militia force in history: a personal paramilitary at his beck and call. Our enemies will quake at our numbers, should further strife come!"
 GGR_arms_under_the_table_desc:0 "Strictly speaking, the Reich has a vested interest in keeping the capacity for violence among the populace at a low level. These are dire times, however, and the new Freikorps cannot afford to be bound by the same laws and regulations as civil organizations. Anything not being directed to the Wehrmacht should be funnelled to the militia; guns, grenades, trucks, even light vehicles and helicopters if possible! They must be a true fighting force, able to hold their own against anything the enemy might throw at them. Every militia fighter must be the equal of a hardened grenadier!"
 GGR_the_unsullied_service_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, Göring's pride and joy, has always been loyal to him and always will be. He is their glorious father and their favorite son, marshal and veteran both. Schörner could never taint this branch of the military, the pinnacle of Aryan martial might! Organizing them for a possible conflict with the militarists will therefore be a simple matter - Göring speaks, and they obey. Air wings shall be recalled, Air Landing divisions put on standby and Fallschirmjäger roused from barracks. While loyalists in the other branches will undoubtedly have a role to play, it is the knights of the sky who will bring us final victory."
 GGR_protect_the_bases_desc:0 "Knowing that he could never sway them, it is likely that Schörner will instead try to sabotage the Luftwaffe by any means possible. Naturally for such a brutish man, his first choice will be to attack vulnerable bases and hangars, probably with commando units or bribed turncoats. Security at all key Luftwaffe facilities must be increased dramatically. It couldn't hurt to have better-armed units up to and including Panzer companies guarding them. Furthermore, security checks must be tightened up and base personnel monitored closely. Even a single broken link in the chain could have severe consequences for our beloved aviators."

It will be obvious to his clique what our reconnaissance aircraft are up to over their Reichskommissariats, but they wouldn't dare turn them back. While we do not expect Schörner to possess a significant air force of his own, the Abwehr has confirmed that he has been devising an answer to the Luftwaffe. His allies also possess large numbers of older aircraft, ostensibly to maintain control over their airspace. It is imperative that we find this mockery of the Luftwaffe wherever it hides and wipe it out the moment Schörner makes his bid for power."
 GGR_move_against_schorner_desc:0 "All possible preparations have been made and enough loyalties have been secured. With the more practical concerns taken care of, we have some administrative reorganization to do. Schörner's clique is deeply entrenched in OKW and in several important Reichskommissariats, which simply cannot continue. We must clear his toadies out of their positions and replace them with more loyal and controllable men of the Führer's own choosing. Schörner will push back against this as soon as he hears of it, but if we move quickly enough we should be able to completely displace his clique before he is prepared for open conflict."
 GGR_replace_the_field_marshal_desc:0 "Schörner once served ably, but no longer. Having lived through both World Wars, the West Russian War and all of the Reich's subsequent conquests, he is getting old and tired. Surely, the old warrior deserves peaceful semi-retirement in a quiet, less stressful role. Reichskommissariat Kamtschatka, perhaps? The Führer is certain that his old friend will be most grateful to have fewer commitments - and to be very, very, very far away from Germania. It's such a stressful place to live, after all."
 GGR_the_afrikajager_desc:0 "Siegfried Müller is incompetent, corrupt, treasonous and possibly the most pathetic excuse for a Reichskommissar in the entire Reich. His oversight of Zentralafrika turned out to be a complete sham and it is only by the Führer's mercy that he yet lives. However, his apparently undesirable traits also make him pliable and easy to control. He can be appeased with material wealth, has no grand ambitions, and his incompetence can be compensated for by delegating his duties. Müller is likely to be the worst Field Marshal the Reich will ever have, but he will certainly be the most useful."
 GGR_the_berliner_ratte_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is no friend of Göring, but he is easily the most competent candidate for the position of Field Marshal. With a long record of service and a reputation for honest patriotism, Speidel is immensely popular amongst both the populace and the Heer. Merely promoting him to the position of Field Marshal would be seen as a supremely wise and generous act, and could bring many militarists to heel. However, he might prove to be more trouble than he's worth; Speidel is a vocal critic of militarism and the Abwehr reports that he has always privately opposed the further expansion of German territory. He may not even be any more loyal than Schörner, in the end. That said, perhaps his principles will win out over his political opposition to Göring, and he will restrain himself appropriately."
 GGR_nepotism_desc:0 "Frankly, Göring has had enough of self-proclaimed 'suitable candidates'. All these ambitious, self-serving men squabbling to take Schörner's place - what good are they, really? How can any of them ever be trusted to abide by the Führer's directives? Any one of them could be another Schörner in waiting, another traitor seeking to stake his claim on the Führership! No, we need a good man, someone we can trust, someone who will neither challenge the Führer's right to rule or attempt to rock the boat.\n\nSomeone like... Theodore Göring, beloved nephew of the Führer! Under-qualified? Perhaps, but also reliable. Besides, who's to say he won't learn on the job?"
 GGR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "At last! We had our doubts - our fears, even - that Schörner would not go quietly, that he would go to any lengths to dominate the Reich. The eruption of a second Bürgerkrieg seemed inevitable as the Field Marshal gathered his forces and rallied countless traitors to his banner. Those few enemies of the Reich who remain no doubt waited with bated breath to see our mighty empire fall to infighting once more.\n\nAnd yet, their dreams will never be realised. The treasonous Field Marshal has been unseated from his office and stripped of any capacity to wage war upon us, all without firing a shot! Relegated to the furthest reaches of Siberia and with his allies bought, bullied or broken, the monster in uniform will never again threaten the Führer's rightful mandate. Heil Göring!"

The cream of the Reich's officer corps, these young men are all seasoned veterans of our many conquests, having learned as much on the battlefield as in the academies. Their loyalties remain undecided, likely due to their preoccupation leaving little time for politicking. Now, however, with Schörner's clique working to shore up their strength, the young generals have become a target for militarist intrigue. The traitor will surely attempt to bring them into his camp by any means necessary. We have to sway them before he has the chance - by hook, or by crook!"
 GGR_incentivize_the_new_guard_desc:0 "Despite their claims to be proud, principled men in the Prussian tradition, many of our new generals are anything but. Part of it is simply the nature of power; money is ultimately merely another means by which to acquire it. In that regard, it is no less effective a currency than blood. Those younger generals who are not yet wholly loyal to either Schörner or the Führer could be easily swayed in the latter's favour by the sweet allure of higher salaries and pensions, or even 'gifts' straight from his own purse. Making someone's life a little easier rarely goes unappreciated, after all..."

Though the older officers shake their heads and rant about the days of austerity under Hitler, the Führer understands the wants and needs of this new and talented generation of leaders. If they require even greater rewards to be satisfied, so be it. Fast cars, country estates, wine from the Führer's own cellar - whatever it takes, they must be loyal to us!"
 GGR_an_abundance_of_medals_desc:0 "The downside to being a newly-minted general these days is the unfortunate shortage of medals one can wear.

Only a few trembling old men can still boast such a grand panoply, and the younger generation of officers feel that they are unfairly compared to the old Prussian officer corps. In his generosity, the Führer has proclaimed that he will restore this proud aesthetic tradition. Henceforth, all deserving generals will have however many pieces of gold, silver and silk to decorate their uniforms as they feel is necessary - all that is necessary is for them to swear eternal allegiance to the one true Führer, Hermann Göring. For one's glory to be so resplendent, is that so high a price?"

There will be no tolerance for preening, vainglorious children within the Wehrmacht's command structure; they will serve because the Führer demands it! All suspect officers will be closely monitored by the Gestapo, and any cowardice, corruption or disloyalty duly punished by the most severe means possible!"
 GGR_and_youre_families_desc:0 "Some young officers think themselves brave. With their egos bloated by their rank and rewards, they believe that they are above discipline and loyalty. Not even the harshest threats to their livelihoods are taken seriously, perhaps due to our historically lax attitude towards officer autonomy under the militarists. They will soon learn that Göring is not Schörner - he does not tolerate his subordinates living corrupt lives as petty kings of their divisions. If threatening their persons is insufficient, perhaps their families should become involved in present matters. After all, isn't family the core of Aryan values?"
 GGR_never_look_the_other_way_desc:0 "Though we have always tried to be merciful to the lesser races of the world, it is an unfortunate reality that many are as recalcitrant children who refuse to acknowledge their betters. Well, as the saying goes: "Spare the rod, spoil the child." We have been tolerant up to this point, but recently some of our subject peoples have been far too uncooperative - even violent. We cannot show weakness in this crucial time; we must discipline these ungrateful savages with bullet and bayonet! Some might balk at this task, but there are a number of officers in the Schörnerite tradition who will follow any order, no matter how harsh or - in the eyes of weak foreigners - inhumane."
 GGR_trials_for_warcrimes_desc:0 "Shocking! A number of our best officers, once thought loyal and true paragons of the Reich, have been directly implicated in horrific war crimes against non-Aryan populations! That something like this could have happened on Schörner's watch is unthinkable - how could any good, honest German ever succumb to such violence and depravity? State media will make this outrage known to the whole Reich, and the guilty parties arrested and brought to trial immediately! National Socialism does not permit acts of senseless brutality and genocide, and nor will the Führer!"
 GGR_reward_faithful_service_desc:0 "Many of the Führer's closest followers have been with him for decades. These officers have proven their loyalty time and time again, supporting him in the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg and beyond. The bravest and truest of Germany's soldiers, their time to be justly rewarded has finally come. Medals and financial benefits are not enough - these men simply must have their own Reichskommissariats! Is there any more comfortable and well-deserved retirement than to manage one of our prosperous and hard-won colonies?"
 GGR_governor_generals_desc:0 "There was a lot of debate within the Führer's cabinet about where to send our new Reichskommissars. After all, we have already allocated all of our conquests to RKs, or annexed them into the Reich. Then, a stroke of genius struck the Führer: Central Asia! It remains one of the most ill-managed and rebellious areas in the greater Reich, probably due to the overstretched and weary administration. The logical solution to the problem is, naturally, to divide the region into four new Reichskommissariats, thereby killing two birds with one stone; the administrative issues will be solved, and our generals will have their promised fiefdoms far, far away from Germania."
 GGR_wandering_minds_desc:0 "The Führer has been notified of an unfortunate occurrence in our logistics department: the new Reichskommissars report that their troops are severely under-equipped! This is truly a tragedy, but how could it have happened? All the paperwork on Germania's end show that the required equipment was shipped out on schedule. Perhaps there was some error, or the trains delivered their cargo to the wrong place? Well, never mind. This will soon be resolved - the Führer himself has pledged to oversee all future deliveries of equipment to Central Asia personally! Our men can rest easy knowing that he's on the job!"

 GGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Treason without compare has struck the Reich once more - we are again engulfed in civil war! The traitor Hans Speidel has risen up in rebellion, and the former Field Marshal, Ferdinand Schörner, has established himself as a rival claimant to the Führership! We have come so far, conquered so much in the name of National Socialism and the Aryan race; we cannot afford to fail now!\n\nOur great Führer has led us through trials to eclipse even the World Wars! He has defeated fleets of thousands - crushed rock and metal and bone beneath the grinding treads of the Wehrmacht! His reign will not end this way, not at their hands! The world he has built will endure for a thousand years! Sieg heil!"
 GGR_the_key_to_victory_desc:0 "Schörner might have his conscript hordes, but we are the sole bearers of the Germanic martial tradition. No violent thug pressed into service and armed with a rifle produced in some god-forsaken Reichskommissariat can hope to match a true son of Germany. We will demonstrate to the world once and for all that German steel, backed by German discipline, is the finest in the world! Only ensuring the continuation of our tradition of high-quality soldiers and equipment will keep us safe from the tide of treachery rising around us."
 GGR_is_on_the_workfloor_desc:0 "German industry remains unrivalled, and we must keep it that way to secure victory! Our factories are filled with strong, dedicated working men, but they slacken and grow restless as word of the war reaches them - this is unacceptable! The bosses must drive them to work harder than ever before, for every bullet that arrives too late could see another valiant soldier of the Reich murdered by the traitors. Failure to dedicate one's entire heart and soul to work in this crucial time is tantamount to desertion, and will be punished as such!"
 GGR_supplies_from_ukraine_desc:0 "An unfortunate but unavoidable side-effect of the Reich's recent expansion is the stretching of our supply lines and the shortage of vital resources accompanying it. The traitors have access to all the industry and resources within the lands they illegally hold, including those which are central to the war effort! Thankfully, with Ukraine secured for the rightful Führer, its vast supplies of oil, steel and grain remain available to us - a very useful thing indeed, with our lands once again riven by war. The Balkans remain secure and difficult for any invader to take, so our eastern supply lines will be redirected to travel through that region alone. We cannot afford further shortages now."
 GGR_is_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Our soldiers have fought long and hard, many for years on end. Still, we must demand one more great effort from the Heer. No matter how many officers and spoilt, ungrateful grunts have defected, the truest and noblest of the Grenadiers remain at our side. It is they who shall carry us to victory, and all possible measures must be taken to maximize their potential. Whether that is wages to keep them loyal, food to keep them happy or pervitin to keep them awake and active, the loyal soldiery will have what they require, and give their all in thanks to the Führer! In this hour, no alternative to absolute dedication is permissible."
 GGR_soldiers_from_the_balkans_desc:0 "The Balkan Garrison is the hard core of the Wehrmacht. Cornwall might have been the best posting, but no amount of watching over shepherds and fishermen could make that garrison the match of the Balkan men! Those grizzled veterans have been fighting a ceaseless guerilla war against rebellious subhumans and Bolshevik partisans for nearly thirty years. More importantly, they have remained at arm's length from the political intrigues of Germania; they are a strictly loyal and obedient force of soldiers and airmen at the Führer's beck and call. It's a good thing that we have subdued all major partisan groups in the region, for men such as they are needed more now than ever. They will be recalled to the Reich and placed directly on the frontlines - the traitors will have a nasty surprise waiting for them if they expected green conscripts!"
 GGR_no_more_militarists_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the traitor Speidel has been a frequent topic of discussion within OKW. The answer, of course, is obvious: no talks with turncoats! The Führer recognizes that no military man ambitious enough to take independent action can ever be trusted. As though the simple act of treason were not bad enough, Speidel is an infamous crypto-Speerite who has time and again questioned the core tenets of National Socialism! Some say he even refuses to accept our deserved right to rule over the lesser races of the world! We will crush this German Judas and all who follow him, as we would any other enemy of the Fatherland!"
 GGR_talk_to_the_rat_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is a traitor, but he is nowhere near as dangerous as Schörner. Speerism is all but dead; he represents no ideological threat to us, only a minor strategic one. Perhaps his apolitical nature and dedication to the preservation of German lives can be turned to our advantage. Schörner represents a threat not only to our new order, but also to the Reich itself - his deranged ambition would see countless millions thrown into the meat grinder for no tangible gain whatsoever! Speidel is not a strong-willed man, and an appeal of equal parts reason and logic might sway him to at least refrain from attacking us and focus his forces on Schörner instead. We can ill afford a war on three fronts, after all..."
 GGR_drive_out_the_villains_desc:0 "The presence of traitors' feet on German soil is a grave insult to the honor of our race and nation. With every day that passes, more gullible fools flock to their banners, spreading the twin poisons of militarism and pacifism. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formulation and execution of a plan to push the renegades out of the Fatherland itself. This will be a legendary cleansing, the likes of which have not been seen since the Bürgerkrieg, to purify Germany of its ills and carve in history the eternal glory and righteousness of our one true Führer! No mercy will be shown to the bearers of this rot and decay, who threaten the very foundations of our world!"
 GGR_germany_under_one_banner_desc:0 "Our situation remains precarious, but the worst of the fires have been extinguished as the traitors have been driven from the Reich proper. Our forces have completely secured the German heartlands and are now busying themselves with mopping up the last holdouts and partisan cells. Speidel and Schörner have fled like the cowards they are, but their forces are already rallying in the Reichskommissariats aligned to their respective sides. Owing to the breadth of our conquests and the chronic disloyalty of the various Reichskommissars, they remain in possession of a great deal of land, resources and manpower. The fight must be taken beyond Germany, but it will be a long, hard road to victory from here on out."
 GGR_use_the_slaves_desc:0 "What is a slave but a machine made of meat, to be used and discarded as its master wishes? Even with our healthy surplus, we have historically placed too much value on the lives and wellbeing of slaves, thinking of them as a precious commodity - this lax attitude ends now! They are a resource to be spent as necessary, and there is no shortage of cheap fuel for war's furnace these days. We must purge the last vestiges of sympathy for these subhumans from our society and put them to maximum possible use; no more breaks, sleep, food or even water unless they prove their particular value. For every fleshy machine that breaks down, there are millions more available to replace it, so why fret over a few more bodies committed to the crematoriums every day?"
 GGR_punish_the_deserters_desc:0 "As the war rages on, the chaff separates from the wheat. Accounts reach us of entire battalions defecting, refusing to follow orders or even retreating without permission. The snake Schörner has always been right about one thing, at least - acts of supreme cowardice cannot be tolerated. Harsh punishments for deserters have been the norm for decades, but with the very existence of the Reich on the line, all disciplinary efforts must be redoubled! If a thousand must die to push a million forward, then so be it! Anyone who refuses to serve in combat will serve on the firing line!"
 GGR_harsher_quotas_desc:0 "Even citizen and volunteer workers continually fail to meet our requirements and expectations! It is shocking and disgraceful to see this kind of unpatriotic laziness in vital war industries, especially considering the stakes of the current conflict. Henceforth, proper military discipline will be employed in all industries, and quotas raised to the necessary levels. For a working man to give anything less than the entirety of his being to the national effort is just as treasonous as siding with the enemy! We'll instate 18-hour working days if we have to; nothing less than total militarization of the factories will bring us victory!"
 GGR_attack_the_pacifists_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of human nature that the common people never really want war. More often than not, they merely lust for the idea of crushing and dominating their nation's enemies. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? However, it is not the soft-hearted masses that dictate policy, but the Führer! The weakling pacifists infesting the Reich's heartland are as much a threat to the morale of our nation as deserters and cowards - thankfully, there is an easy way to turn the people against them and bring the populace to the Führer's bidding. All we need do is remind the people of this war's true stakes, which will expose the pacifists' lack of patriotism and endangerment of the nation. This has never failed us before, and once carried out will ensure that nobody will complain when those treasonous scum are dragged from their houses and shot as the cowards they are."
 GGR_men_on_the_frontlines_desc:0 "What do we even have men in the factories for? What value does a man truly hold if he will not don a helmet and carry a rifle into combat for the sake of his country? We face a life or death struggle for the future of the Reich - now is the hour for each and every true Aryan man to live up to the standards envisioned by the great Hitler! We need everyone to fight this war - from every floor of every factory in every Gau! Any who refuse to down their ploughshares for swords will be considered traitors to the cause and dealt with appropriately!"
 GGR_women_in_the_factories_desc:0 "The Aryan-Feminists bleated for years about wanting the opportunity to work in factories like their husbands; now, they shall have it. With the men shipped off to more suitable occupations, we have a skilled labor shortage that slaves cannot fulfil. True, these women are lacking in experience and the strength of soul that makes men superior workers, but this is Judgement Day for the Reich! Extreme measures must be taken at home just as readily as on the frontlines, and if that includes violating sacrosanct gender roles, then so be it."
 GGR_pows_in_the_camps_desc:0 "All these captured traitors are languishing in POW camps, eating our bread and occupying our guards. That bread should be going to the troops, those guards should be fighting for the Reich, and those prisoners should be making themselves useful! If they would claim to be the true sons of Germany, then let them try and prove it in the work camps! Perhaps their claims will be verified, or maybe they will redeem themselves through back-breaking labor - "Work will set you free", after all. While we're at it, perhaps the numerous civilians who have yet to prove their worth should be... redefined. Redefined as Schörnerite spies, for instance, rather than mere cowards and slackers."

 GGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "Once more, the Reich has fallen into chaos. Göring may have been our preferred stalking horse in the Reichstag but his gluttony and incompetence have cost us dearly. His economic mismanagement has sunk the Reich to a new low, his flamboyance and extravagance emptying its coffers and putting its slaves into open revolt. The German people have been infected with his laziness, his femininity, and his cowardice. Fortunately there is no character so low that righteous war cannot rectify it."
 GGR_stand_for_your_fatherland_desc:0 "Most of our citizens have sat idle these past few years, content to let slaves do the work. The Wehrmacht has become the only constant, always requiring more men to maintain the balance of our empire. It is vital that the people understand the importance of what we do, that they join us in our purging of the rot that has corrupted the Reich. Goebbels may be long dead but his lessons hold true - the people must be galvanised by propaganda. Let the posters and banners fly. It is better they make the choice to enlist on their own. It lets them think they still have a choice."
 GGR_war_in_the_factories_desc:0 "This is a total war. Goebbels understood the value of making the war felt by everyone, from the front lines to the fields to the factories. We must ensure our workers know the importance of their labour, and redouble their efforts to produce arms for the fatherland. The factory floor will be reorganised into a home front, with clear ranks established for every worker. Work squads will be directed at their tasks by floor sergeants, and every task will be timed down to the minute, ensuring when a mistake is made it will not be made again. When we are done, the production line will be indistinguishable from the front line."
 GGR_war_in_the_fields_desc:0 "Out here in the fields, you fight for your meals. All one can see for miles on end is the Reich. All one sees is the front line. Europe is consumed in warfare once more, and it is essential that the soldiers understand that.\n\nIf we do not hold Ukraine, whose bread will feed their families back home? Danish pork and butter are a staple at every table, Bohemian cars fill the streets of every city, Baltic farms are home to a cousin of every other man in this army. If we do not win this war, we risk losing everything the Reich has fought for for the past century. We fight for what is ours."
 GGR_war_in_the_mind_desc:0 "This war is perhaps the most important we have ever fought. If the Reich cannot be halted in its fall, if Göring and Speidel are allowed to continue to destroy it then all is lost and the Führer's dream will be dead. Our troops must understand this - they must not falter in their mission, they must show no mercy, and they must never surrender. Thus far they have been found lacking. The number of rounds wasted on deserters is too high when they could be put to use against the enemy. We shall require our troops swear oaths of loyalty, and officers instructed to keep a closer eye on their men. And every man will keep an eye on his comrades - for there are traitors around every street corner."
 GGR_volkssturm_desc:0 "To achieve a great future blood must be spilled. Just because one is not eligible for conscription into the Wehrmacht does not mean one cannot be of use to their country. The Volkssturm shall serve as a home for those too old for the Wehrmacht, those too infirm to drill with a rifle and those women who are called upon to serve the Reich in its time of great need. Though their equipment may be lacking in quality, their training substandard and their uniforms virtually nonexistent, they will fill holes in the line just as well as any Heer Soldat. It will serve as a useful means of disposal for critical of our way of thinking."
 GGR_all_traitors_shall_bleed_desc:0 "Our efforts have proven successful so far, with the flow of fresh recruits to the front line broadening into a torrent. There will always be elements of cowardice that must be rooted out however - the common soldier must be taught the value of discipline and diligence. Anyone attempting to undermine the war effort, by words or by actions, is a traitor and will be treated as such. The Reich is a machine of flesh and metal, and when a cog gets stuck or a spring breaks, you replace it. We have neither the time nor the inclination to waste our efforts with trials or prisons. Shoot them."
 GGR_those_without_desc:0 "We had hoped that Göring would prove a willing ally as Führer - while he may be vain and gauche he is a military man. Sadly it was not to be, his leadership limp-wristed, his monetary management ham-fisted and his policies ill-thought. He has proven truculent in our attempts to steer him and now he has bucked the reins and risks bringing the Reich we have fought so hard for crashing into a ditch. He must die, and those that followed him in life will follow him to the firing line.\n\nEnding that glory hound Speidel will merely be the cherry on top of the cake. From the battlefields of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line to the balconies of the Berghof he has followed us, always casting his shadow. He has hindered us for too long, and it will be a pleasure to see him swinging from a rope. "
 GGR_and_those_within_desc:0 "Examples have been made, and we have been patient enough. Soldiers linger away from their duties, eager to spend as much time away from the front as possible. They make excuses, hide in their barracks, spend time on frivolities like lunch breaks. No longer. Spare time is wasted time, and wasted time is dereliction of duty. \n\nThe newly issued 'Richtlinien für die Behandlung der Zeitverschwender' will crack down on these time wasters. Any soldier found away from the front lines without written orders from a superior officer will be hanged. Any officer who fails to carry out these orders will be shot. What more fitting punishment for those who refuse to defend German women and children?"
 GGR_no_retreat_desc:0 "This front is too vital to fall without a fight. No matter how many men they throw at us, no matter how many bodies we must expend, we will bleed for every second we must buy for our forces across the Reich to muster against the enemy. There will be not one step back for our men, not until they reach the very walls of [ROOT.GetCapitalName]. \n\nOf course, the Reichsmarshall and his staff are too vital to leave to the enemy. They will evacuate when the time is right. "
 GGR_shorten_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Even we are willing to admit the Wehrmacht has become somewhat bloated since its glory days in the forties. Our ranks are filled with upjumped, inexperienced officers who scarcely remember the Second World War, let alone the first. They are more a hindrance than a help - what use can they be commanding men in combat if they have never seen the front lines? \n\nWe shall do them a favour and shorten the chain of command. Those without experience will be demoted to NCO ranks, those that complain will find themselves no different to the Soldaten they once commanded. Perhaps if they survive, they can work their way back up the ranks."
 GGR_slaves_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Slaves are one of the few things we have in abundance. They may be lazy and insubordinate, their work shoddy and substandard, but they provide the majority of the Reich's labour. They are many and individually quite worthless - it would be a mistake not to utilise them in our hour of need. Their blood is inferior but they take a bullet just as well as any Aryan.\n\nPromise them freedom, or food, or a day off - we have no obligation to follow through. March them at gunpoint and send them at the enemy barricades. Every one that dies is a German life saved, and maybe after the war there won't be so many of them to worry about."
 GGR_nowhere_left_to_run_desc:0 "A cornered dog is the most dangerous kind. Every man, woman and child here knows their duty, to defend this land to their dying breath, and with all avenues of escape cut off even the most desperate coward must stand and fight. When men are ordered to march, we expect them to march. When they are ordered to kill, we expect that they kill. And when they are ordered to die, we expect them to die. Any less is treason."
 GGR_a_lost_cause_desc:0 "The situation here has become untenable. The front lines are dissolving, with deserters fleeing faster than our blocking squads can shoot them. All the same, we can ensure the enemy gains nothing of value from this land. Land mines and indiscriminate artillery fire will slow their advance long enough to extract men and materiel, while we set light to the fields and salt the earth beneath with defoliants. Ammo dumps will be rigged with time delayed bombs, sending any would-be scavengers to kingdom come. There is always the next Reichskommissariat."
 GGR_exhaust_the_workers_desc:0 "Scorched earth tactics do not merely extend to the land itself. Blood and soil are inextricably linked - it would be ridiculous to burn the crops and leave those who tend them to replant them the next day. They must be wrung for every last drop of effort before we evacuate, every ounce of arms and armaments and supplies taken.  If they must work in double shifts to ensure that we eventually take the helm, so be it. When we return they will no doubt be grateful we spared their lives."
 GGR_dispose_of_the_useless_desc:0 "Slaves have always been disposable - that is their purpose. If we cannot take them with us to the next front, so be it. Round them up and put a bullet in them before we leave. The work camps they once occupied are valuable assets and it would be foolish to leave them intact for the next contender. Shell them, bomb them, set them alight. There is no sense in evacuating those with no reason to live."
 GGR_burn_capital_desc:0 "A capital is temporary, for we are always on the march. If this one does not suit us we will find a new one, one more suitable for our needs. Of course, it would be hypocritical to leave this city intact and ready starve when we have demolished the factories and salted the earth behind us in the name of a better Reich. They do not even have slaves any more. It is kinder to set it alight behind us when we leave."

GGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The Madness of Göring and Schörner has collapsed like a house of cards. Now once again Germans are shooting on Germans. The failure of National Socialism in it's current state is evident. Now it falls to Speidel to restore the Reich to some semblance of sanity. If that means reform then so be it. Working with students, working with partisans or even abandoning RK's outright. The Reich will be reformed into something more reasonable. It doesn't have a choice."
GGR_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "If the German people as well as all the other people currently within the Reich want to see their chains broken and a measure of freedom restored, then they have no choice, but to stay with us. While our promises have to be vague at the moment, once we have triumphed over Schörner and Göring surely we will reform the Reich into something more "pleasant" than what it has been in the past."
GGR_rally_the_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the army still follows Schörner or Göring, even the forces that have joined us are still somewhat reluctant to accept Speidel as their new leader. In this critical situation we can't afford to let lingering distrust impact our effort to save the Reich. Let's remind them, that Speidel is the saviour of Germania during the first civil war, the vanquisher of Himmler's coup during the West russian War and that now he will save Germany once again. Unsere letzte Hoffnung heißt Speidel."
GGR_rally_the_students_desc:0 "The students of the Reich have suffered much in the recent years, between the first Civil War, Görings crackdown and being sent off to die in the various wars. Hence their distrust of any Wehrmacht general, even one that actually wants to improve their situation is natural. Speidel will have a lot of convincing to do to gain their support. However if they want to see reform of the Reich within their lifetime then they will have no choice but to support Speidel. "
GGR_a_united_front_desc:0 "It took a lot of talking, haggling and pleading, but finally the Students and the parts of the Wehrmacht that have sided with us have agreed to form a united front against our enemies. It's condition is still brittle, but with time and hopefully success it will form into a front of solid iron that will have the strength to do what it must: Save the Reich from its current self."
GGR_call_to_the_partisans_desc:0 "While dealing with the various collaborators that have supported Reich, Speidel has inevitably gotten contact with various groups that are willing to rise up as partisans, but whoms ideological composition is not so far away as to be untenable. Directly helping potential enemies of the Reich might not be the clean choice, but giving a hand to let these partisan groups rise up in our current enemies territory can prove very valuable."
GGR_the_iberians_desc:0 "Ever since Iberia fell to our invasion, the peninsula has become a mess of partisans and garrisons fighting it out. With the Civil War this situation only intensified. With the number and variety of resistance organizations very large, it is easy to simply support a few of those to rise up in pro-Schörner and pro-Göring controlled areas,but not in ours."
GGR_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Schörner controlled areas include many of the former and current slavic inhabited lands. Having them rise up in an attempt to liberate their lands is not only likely to happen with or without our help, if we give them a bit of support here and there, they will likely draw away a significant amount of hostile forces away from our current areas of engagement.  And no matter who wins, we can just deal with them afterwards."
GGR_the_scandinavians_desc:0 "Scandinavia, especially the valuable mines of Lappland and northern Sweden have seen large influxes of slave workers recently. With the territory being lowly populated, vast in scale and difficult to control, it is a prime area for an uprising. A bit of help here and there can help this to come about quicker. Still the emptiness of the region will prevent the uprising from spreading too far into our own areas of control."
GGR_all_for_a_prosperous_europe_desc:0 "With various partisan uprisings as well as our own war effort underway, a glorious future for Europe might now be within reach. Speidels Germany and it's vision is clear: All of Europe shall become prosperous once more under our leadership, the leadership of the Unity Pakt"
GGR_know_when_to_fight_desc:0 "This war is not yet over! We may have been pushed back and delayed temporarily, but we will fight on from one of those Reichskommissariat loyal to us.

Now he reigned the Fatherland in his wake. Even if they do whatever spineless things they are perfectly capable of doing, they won't get the chance, not when he starts pressing his black boot against their necks. And that is despite his own dream of reshaping the economy of the Reich. Without them, he shall be master of the Reichs wealth, free to use it for his own purposes and the greater needs of the people.\n\n For now, it was important to really sink the teeth of the state into their assets and their very persons. He ordered no mercy in his pronunciations against the hoard rats. He denounced them for their "crimes against the personal wealth of each and every German citizen." And he insulted them as economists and monetarists who are as corrupt as the Jews.  He even went so far as to accuse them of serving themselves; of being under the dirty paws of Jews - if they were not Jewish themselves.\n\n And naturally, they were swiftly dealt with in any manner available. From simply refusing to do business with them up to crafting unfortunate accidents that befell them, the good Fuhrer would let these slide. As long as they help him throw those rapacious financiers out of society, he would not need to apply Germany's justice against them.\n\n After all, the natural enemy of the Fatherland was not those who served the Fuhrers interests but those who sought to be opportunistic; to squeeze them out like the thieves they are, returning their booty to those who rightfully possess it.

The soldier didn't let his sight linger in one place, always bringing it from left to right. Entrances, exits, pathways, and obstacles; he stopped to look forward and walked to the front, then turned sharply, facing the center.\n\nHe let his left hand reach down, groping at an empty belt. The man bit his lower lip, remembering that he was not in a place that allowed for weapons. This was a school, the thought came across his mind. You'll get it back.\n\nThe professor, a fat man with graying stubble and a trembling right hand, spoke to his students, who either seemed intimidated by this visitor or, perhaps, excited. A few showed no emotion, only curiosity.\n\nThe man waited for his own chance to speak. Patiently, of course. But the way the man spoke, with its awe; its naivety; its ignorance — his voice annoyed him. His left hand groped for the empty space by his belt once more. Nothing to hold; nothing to bring up and shoulder; nothing to give him some measure of control, of safety. Just as sweat dropped down his neck.\n\nWhen the older man stopped speaking and returned to his seat, the soldier — an experienced rifleman who had served as the Fatherland saw fit for him to serve in whatever place, then serving once more to win the Fatherland for the new Fuhrer — stiffened.\n\nThoughts raced through his head, as bullets once did by his ears. A nervousness rang as ruined bells inside his equally ruined mind. And the full measure of the past rose back up to the surface, tormenting him with the truths of war as these students seemed not to really comprehend anything at all.\n\nThis war of mine, he said to himself, reminding his conscience, is not theirs to thoroughly appreciate. He wished himself to will through and speak about his experiences as they were to him; raw, brutal, and traumatic. But the state would not permit it; war was a glorious thing, as the new Fuhrer declared for a new Germany.\n\nHis left hand pressed against his thigh. And he began to speak, choosing to lie to them — to lull them into the dream of conquest and of power they wanted to believe.

They are armed with six spare MG34s rather than MG3s and crewed by eight men. The most modern armament is the mounting for a recoilless rifle on top of the vehicle to provide the Volkspanzer with an anti-panzer punch!\n\nSome vile, seditious wretches have suggested that the resulting 30 tonne, 20 kph vehicle is not really the vehicle that we need to win the war, and that we should be focusing on proven weapons of war.

That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways. \n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

Many claim the Führer looked worried, and he was.

Can you imagine how far ahead we could be if the militarists hadn't spent the last 20 years gutting our research capabilities with their political games? In fact, I thought that would be what you would say there- it's what you highlighted in your speech."\n\n "Oh, yes, of course. Centralizing the research body. Yes, that's a big reason, too."

My suggestion is that we transfer guns from the garrisons to make up the deficit, build some new ones, and replace the oldest guns with newer models to make up the gap. It won't fully solve our issues, but it will be economically sound. All in favor?"\n\nMumbling and debate rumbled across the table. Osenberg watched- he never expected such a suggestion to be a unanimous agreement- but he let out a small sigh when Remer got to his feet.\n\n "I must respectfully disagree, Herr Osenberg." Remer said with a grin. "We can't let our armies, the prides of the Reich, be equipped with suboptimal equipment any longer, in my opinion. We must be better armed than our opponents, shouldn't we? I propose that we devote as many resources as possible to rearming our soldiers with the best the Reich has, no matter the cost. No soldier should die because he must carry a bolt-action into battle!"\n\nMore applause.

Their eyes did not meet his, instead glued to the blueprint laid out on the table, tracing the lines and numbers that made up the tank. Osenberg's eyes shot to the name- the Liger.\n\n "In the opinion of our scientists, this is the ideal tank, my Führer. Brilliant agility, great speed, and the firepower to destroy anything the Americans and Japanese can muster. If the project goes ahead, I can guarantee that this will only bolster our armies." The scientist stuttered. Göring did not address these remarks, instead turning to Osenberg, who had still not moved.\n\n "Herr Osenberg, what do you make of this design?" Göring asked.\n\n "It's terrible." Osenberg grunted.\n\n "What about it?" Göring replied.\n\n "Shit, Hermann, look at the fucking thing. Two guns? The terrible armor? The weight? It's as big as a than a Tiger and half as useful. There's nothing good in it."\n\nThe scientist began to defend himself, but Göring cut him off with a wave of his hand. "No, no, Werner, I don't think you see the potential here. It's a blueprint- a prototype, isn't it?" Göring kept going before the man could answer. "Sure, there are flaws, but I see a lot of potential in this. Can you imagine the American reaction to getting run over by twin-gunned heavy tanks at 70 kilometers an hour?" He turned to the engineer, addressing him directly for the first time this meeting. "Tell your men to get to work on this Liger. I'm confident in your success. The Heer counts on it."\n\nEven as the engineer stammered out a short "Yes, my Führer", a faint groan of displeasure left Osenberg's lips."

Werner sighed and ran his hand through his hair- he could swear it was already thinning even faster from all this. "Is there a problem?" He asked.\n\n "Our efforts to improve upon the original Liger design have hit a small snag. We've improved upon the engine- it's got more power, more speed, and can push the tank along at a quicker pace."\n\n "So what's the catch?" Osenberg asked. He had a feeling he could already guess, but he wanted to hear it from the man himself.\n\n "To produce this new engine, we'll need more time and more money. If you refuse, we'll do what we can to streamline the production of the old engine, but the speed of the tank may be a bit. . .less."\n\nOsenberg sighed again. He could already see it now- the Liger, an expensive money sink, a complete waste of time, and he'd catch all the blame for it. No matter that he was against the project from the start- Göring sure as hell wouldn't take the fall for him, friendly as the two were. Of course, perhaps the fundamental issues of the Liger could be fixed- or at least mitigated- with enough money and development. Who knows, perhaps it could become something workable. Asking for more time and more money would be a pain, but if it saved the project, maybe it was worth it.\n\nOsenberg turned back to the man, his mind made up.

With this new armor, we believe that many of your concerns will be alleviated."The engineer spoke in a calm, rehearsed manner. Osenberg couldn't tell if he had been practicing his spiel or if he just always sounded like that. Engineers do tend to sound a bit robotic, he thought.\n\n "And let me guess." Osenberg slid further back into his chair. "It will cost money and time to actually make this new armor, and I'll need to go beg the Führer for a few more reichsmarks?"\n\nThe engineer stammered, his flow interrupted. "Uh, yes, something like that. If you don't give us the funding, we'll do what we can with what we have, but the armor-"\n\n "The armor might be less functional, yes, yes, I can guess that."

He crumpled the report and threw it at the engineer, watching as it harmlessly flew over the man's head.\n\n "What I wanted to say, Herr Osenberg, is that the guns are unable to penetrate the heaviest tanks that our enemies wield. If we were to upgrade them, they would be a match for anything the Americans or Japanese have." The engineer spoke rapidly, trying to defuse the situation. It worked- Osenberg took a deep breath and sat back down.\n\n "Ah, sorry about all that. Got a little carried away. Anyway, you want more funding for new guns?" Osenberg said, his voice a little strained.\n\n "Yes, Herr Osenberg. Of course, we can use the old ones- they function well enough, and it wouldn't cost any money or time to keep them- but these new guns could help push the Liger into greatness."\n\nOsenberg held in his laugh- he already had lost his temper once, now was not the time to make himself seem like a lunatic.

His gaze lingered on the guns the longest, as if he could already imagine the cannons obliterating American tanks. The three men crewing the prototype watched closely as the Führer continued his loop around the tank, taking in every last bit of it. Finally, he motioned to his aides, and the party of officials departed for a nearby hill, from which they would observe the tests.\n\nIn a moment, the tank revved its engine and sped down the course. Göring watched intensely, gazing through the pair of binoculars he had been provided with. Occasionally, he'd make a side comment to one of the engineers, praising the speed of the tank or commenting on its majestic appearance. However, as the test went on, the praise began to fade.\n\nThe Liger, despite its beginning appearance, seemed to struggle as the test continued. The tank was only able to complete its shooting at a pace that barely trailed the Leopard, despite the twin guns' supposed strength. The engine, which once launched the Liger around the trials in a flash, began to pour black smoke. In a final coup de grâce, the Liger turned to fire upon its final targets, only for the first gun to be blown out of its mounting, flipping backward and tearing through the roof of the tank before slamming to a halt in the soft mud. The ensuing explosion obliterated the crew cabin and all the unlucky men inside.\n\nThe lead engineer instinctively looked over for the Führer's reaction. Göring's eyes, now ice cold, seemed to look straight through the man.

The tank is terrible."\n\n "I saw, Werner, but now isn't the time to lay blame. We need solutions and we need them fast." Hermann responded. His voice was calmer than Osenberg thought it would be. His tone only frustrated Osenberg more- did he not understand what this meant?\n\n "Easy for you to say! This is my ass we're talking about here, Hermann!" Osenberg finished off his drink in one large swig. Hermann said nothing, instead staring off into space. For a moment, Osenberg thought he might have died then and there. After an uncomfortable pause, Hermann's gaze turned to Osenberg, and he began to speak.\n\n "Look, Werner. This whole tank was built off Schörner and Remer's idea-" Osenberg scoffed. Of course Hermann would blame someone else for this. Göring's eyes steeled, and Osenberg shut himself up. "Now, listen to me. We show the Liger off to the public in a parade soon. We get Schörner and Remer to give speeches- we tie them to the project. Then, when it comes out the Liger is a mess, we point to them- they had the idea, they wanted the tank. They look like fools, we get out unscathed, everyone wins. Is that alright?"\n\nThere was another silence. Osenberg hid his surprise under a layer of discontent- he didn't think Göring had it in him to think that quickly. "Yes. Yes, I can work with that.

His seat, stationed just to the right of the podium, gave him a stellar view of the Feldmarschall as he began. Outwardly, he kept his smile up as he pretended to listen to Schörner's words. Inwardly, however, his mind was shot through and through with panic.\n\nThe plan that he and Göring had hammered out seemed to be going accordingly so far, but so many things could go wrong. If Schörner found out, the result could be catastrophic. If the plan was leaked, it would prove a massive embarrassment to Göring's administration. Even if the plan went correctly, what if Schörner and Remer managed to pass the blame themselves? It would eventually find its way back to the GDRWI, if not Osenberg himself, and then he would have another mess to deal with. Besides, how much had keeping the Liger's poor performance secret from the military already cost the Reich? Bribing that many people paid a hefty price, and there was no guarantee that one hadn't snitched.\n\nOsenberg realized that the people around his chair were now looking at him, and he snapped out of his thoughts. The sound of applause and Schörner's voice mixed together, and Osenberg looked to see Schörner pointing to him- complimenting his work, he assumed. He quickly brought back his smile and waved to Schörner. The two made eye contact, and for a moment, Osenberg thought he saw something more than just a standard complementary glance in the Feldmarschall's eyes.

The whispers tore through divisions like wildfire, the theories as to what the drugs were doing growing more and more outlandish by the day. Suddenly, it was thought that Göring was trying to poison his enemies, that Osenberg was setting up for a coup, that Schörner was planning an execution of those who disliked him, that the Jews had infiltrated the highest ranks of the Reich and were planning a mass mind control campaign to destroy Nazism. All of these theories ran almost purely on conjecture and hypothesis, but that was all it took to buffett the conspiracy to even higher levels.\n\nWhen the first reports of the controversy hit Göring's desk, it was already far too late to stop the rumors. Nothing he could say would end the spiraling theories- if anything, they would only make them worse.

A final telephone call to the Führer informs him that there is five seconds before the test firing.\n\n5...4...3...2...1...\n\nNothing.\n\nHigh in orbit, nothing happens. The Sonnengewehr begins to slowly drift out of it's target alignment, listing and beginning to revolve end over end on a slow course towards the Earth's upper atmosphere. Later investigations will reveal that the Sonnengewehr failed due to one simple, unforeseen consequence. The hundreds of mirrors all reflecting the sun, were also absorbing too much heat. The heat spilled into vital electronic systems, overwhelming the insulation and frying the main computer systems.\n\nIn the GGRCSI bunker there is mass panic as the members realise the magnitude of the failure that is occuring before them. A gunshot is heard as the Team Leader blows dispatches himself across the command console. A stampede for the exit and then the border before the Abwehr can pursue them. The projected fall of the Sonnengewehr will be across most of the vast expanse of the Russian Steppes, giving at least one good outcome of the tremendous failure."

The downside is the costs. Solar panels are very expensive, and the modification to the satellite would greatly increase the already great costs.\n\n The scientists are arguing that the investment is well worth the cost, and that we shouldn't cut corners on the project.This begs two questions; are we able and willing to shell out the capital?"

During his speech, he highly praised the wise leading of the Führer and the bravery of the Afrika Korps. At the end of his speech, he said, "such a great victory has proved that, under the genius of our Führer the Reich has totally recovered from the chaos before, and I believe we will eventually destroy the Americans just like in Africa."\n\nMeanwhile, in every corner of the Reich, every radio and television channel was required to live broadcast this speech.

It was not one of those marvelous and expensive machines the Luftwaffe had been toying with nor was it even as sleek as any of the private crafts the corporate big-wigs were so fond of. No, this was an older, but also far more durable model that had been built for use in the African Reichskommisars. This was the personal vehicle of Siegfried Müller.\n\nThe craft's landing was… not graceful by any stretch, bumping twice and skidding half a foot. Göring fleetingly wondered if the pilot was drunk. He hoped the former Reichskommisar was unharmed. Still, he reminded himself, if the man could survive the South African War and a run from the OFN for the past several months, a little jostling wouldn't be the end of him. He was brought out from his thoughts by the sound of the 330 Puma's cockpit door opening. From the pilot's seat hopped a man in the dress of a common mercenary, a Sturmgewehr 45 slung over one shoulder; it was Siegfried Müller himself! Only moments before the Führer had been annoyed by the mediocre landing, but that was all forgotten now. The Führer gave a non-formal salute that Müller did not even bother returning, but Göring didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n"Herr Müller, it is so good to finally see you in person again! I had no idea you had taught yourself to fly helicopters during your time in Africa. It was most impressive to watch you in the sky if I may say."\n\nMüller flashed the smile that had won him adoring fans all across the Reich, "Why thank you my Führer. Yes, I did pick up some skills in my time, mostly for the purpose of getting to hunting spots you see, but I am thrilled to have impressed the great Reichsmarschall himself."\n\n"Hunting, yes I did know you were quite an exceptional marksman.

goering.707.desc:0 "Göring sat alone in his chambers, with but a tumbler of whiskey in his hand, silently contemplating the latest fiasco which Iberia once again revealed to the world. With the Italians out of Algeria and the government in Algiers at tatters, the Caudillos thought they could finallyclaim this land as theirs- and who better to govern this new fiefdom than their long-time lackey, Yves-Guerin Seraç, as leader of a French-minority military government? Göring smirked- this arrangement could go wrong in so many ways. And go wrong it did: Seraç didn't even bother to get comfortable in his new post before he denounced his overlords and established the State of Algeria as an independent entity on world politics. The idiots- they really need to learn to pick their subordinates. \n\nNot that he was in too enviable a position either. His own "subordinates" were already encircling the young warlord like hawks, fighting amongst themselves as to how to deal with him. Some believed that Seraç's clique would prove a valuable lapdog for the Reich, safeguarding the region's oil deposits and providing fresh untermenschen to throw in the front lines that would otherwise have been pure blooded Germans; others yet are disgusted at the idea of once again allowing collaborators to partake in Germany's moment of greatness, and insist on crushing all resistance and setting a new Reichskommisariat that will ensure all affairs are handled by proper German hands. \n\nSo Göring was left with a decision to make; a luxury he didn't get too often anymore. Personally he had way more important things to tend to right now than another shithole in Africa- and in a way, that made the prospect of just collaborating with Seraç and letting him do the dirty work very tempting. And if the man has an ounce of self preservation he'll surely cooperate. On the other hand, self preservation didn't stop him from betraying the very people who put him in power. And no matter how disillusioned he had grown through the decades, even old Hermann had to admit that asking an arrogant asshole in Africa for help like they needed him was just plain wrong."

goering.708.desc:0 "The General will see you now, gentlemen, and apologises for your wait" announced a sturdy male voice that made Valentin Scheller raise his head from his copy of Die Beobachter, where his attention had been drawn to for the last three hours. The voice belonged to a uniformed Pied-Noir, who then proceeded to bow and show the way to him and the disgruntled ministers besides him. But Scheller was calm; he knew by now why people like Seraç had to show they were "too busy" for people like him. \n\nIndeed, as they stepped into the grandiosely decorated room, one would think they were in a palace; just like one would think, as they looked towards the Lion of Algeria, Yves-Guerin Seraç, sitting in his designer suit with the air of a man who had won every battle of his life, warmly welcoming them with a sardonic smile, that this man had no doubts about this day. A lot of work and money was poured into this illusion, surely. But these men hadn't come all the way from Germania to stare at gold candelabras and fine paintings; and as the pleasantries faded away and the negotiations began, it soon became very clear to all involved that Seraç's deck was empty. \n\n...which makes it not only desirable, but integral, that the Ministry of Economy shall retain complete autonomy to dictate and direct its own budget, with the Dinar as its default currency, which shall remain pegged to the French Franc and not to the Reichsmark" was how the longly worded but in reality fairly short list of Algerian demands concluded, which included the retention of the established French-styled government and all French ministers within it, the sovereignty of the armed forces, with German garrisons in Algeria supplementing instead of guiding the Algerian command, as well as direct state control of at least 50% of the exploration perimeters of the national oil fields. The carefully crafted and practiced document that constituted another piece to Seraç's masterful bluff, described in the most intrepid light what his true goal -or pledge- was: to please be left alone and retain whatever authority he could over his small fiefdom. All this futile act confirmed Scheller's suspicion: Seraç had no way out, and had nothing to resort to but to beg. With the tiniest and rarest of smiles creeping up on his lips, he opened his own briefcase with calm, precise movements."

"I understand that the remaining deposits might fall short of your 50% goal, Herr Seraç, but Herr Göring is willing to offer subsidies upwards of 10 million Reichsmarks per year as reparation. As for the lands occupied by foreign investors, we are willing to aid you in their immediate eviction. After all, the Unity-Pakt should offer you much greater return in investment regarding all your exports." What he failed to mention was that the trading policies of the Unity-Pakt towards Reichsprotektorats mandated that any and all exports shall be controlled through Germania, from where they will be sold as German goods. \n\nAnd that's only a small footnote in the book of things that were not explicitly mentioned in the contracts. Like how the part about national-controlled oil fields did not mention endless nights of drinking with the President and major shareholders of Sonatrach, who had agreed to set the groundwork for a merger with IG Farben. Or how the part autonomy of the government did not mention the heavy handed deals that were scheduled after their arrival of German observers, or the unexpected... empty seats that would arise during their stay. Or how the support role of the German garrisons did not mention the astronomical bribes to several high-ranking officers. For Kirchmann and his business associates, this was what one would call a hostile takeover; for Seraç, this was the loss of whatever control he managed over his state, and the transformation of his perceived role as ruthless dictator into that of a powerless scapegoat for the colony's misfortunes. \n\n"I believe that will be all for now, Monsieur Seraç" interceded Scheller, standing up from the table as Kirchmann was packing his papers. "It is getting late. In the following week you will have plentiful opportunities to converse with us on the details." He gave a tiny smirk, a rare occurence. "I believe you will see that everything should be very advantageous for you and your administration. Bon nuit, gentlemen."

But someone had to keep the state afloat- and there was no other man he'd trust that on but himself. \n\nHis train of thought was interrupted by the sudden sound of an incoming telegram- directly from his Chief of Navy.

"Those bastards think they can just barge in as if this is their damn playground! How has the General allowed this?" The news ticker read: "Kriegsmarine violates Algerian sea zone, harasses local fishermen". \n\nSeraç closed the TV, and violently broke the remote on his desk. Useless! Useless! All of them! How could he, after all the pain and sacrifice he had gone through, have surrounded himself with such useless people? People that could only inform him of an impending invasion AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWS! Or was it not stupidity? Was his staff intentionally withholding this information from him until it could no longer be held secret? He could not know- he had lost too many friends to tell anymore- and did not care.

Within the following week they will be followed by the appropriate Garrisons and border divisions, three military engineer detachments, equipment and representatives from IG Farben, among others. \n\nWhile the scheduled reinforcement of the colony is fairly heavier than typical of other RKs, especially ones of this size, and their absence from the Fatherland will be noticeable for some time, this will hopefully allow Nordafrika to serve as the coordinative and administrative center for all our future ambitions in Egypt and the Maghreb."

"You allowed your subordinate to discharge a firearm at an envoy of the Reich. But you didn't actually care about the slur. Not enough to stage a crisis over it." He looked forward again, waiting briefly for a response that never came. "Neither did he; his demeanor was too calm." He puffed a ring of smoke. "It was Seraç himself who ordered this. He wanted you to be violent and ruthless. He wants to show he fears no one. And you still didn't have the balls to do it without being provoked." \n\n"And what difference does it make to you?" growled Julien through his teeth, as his captive nonchalantly spit out his cigarette and stomped it on the hallway carpet."

 goering.801.desc:0 "German workers, though they have not made up the majority of the workforce for a decade, make up a valuable and technically knowledged middle class. They run the factories and offices of our empire, and the eruption of strikes recently has put a spanner in the works. Naturally, the first reaction is to send in the Orpo to have their way with the strikers and put the fear of the Führer into them, but perhaps a more diplomatic solution can be reached. Some token concessions should be enough to placate them before we tighten the reins once more.\n\nWhile we may not like to admit it, in many cases other hands can perform their jobs just as well as German ones do. Outsourcing their jobs to foreign workers would put the strikers in their place and ensure the work gets done. Alternatively the tasks could be delegated to the slaves - though we have no guarantee of how well they will perform them."

 goering.802.t:0 "Fight For Your Rights"
 goering.802.desc:0 "The gentle simmering in the slave camps has once again turned into a boil.  They have put down what tools they have and begun to riot against their masters, causing havoc and slaughtering those Germans standing against them. Naturally the massacre of innocent citizens of the Reich demands a response in force, the slaves once again shackled and reprisals taken, but there exist options on how this is to be achieved.\n\nThe Heer are always champing at the bit for their next fight and they are better equipped than anyone to deal with an armed uprising, but allowing them to take credit for another victory may do more harm than good, and set a dangerous precedent for the future. The Orpo have an opportunity to intervene and maintain their authority against the Heer, but this in turn would snub our glory-seeking generals.\n\nNaturally the local workers are enraged at the murder of their comrades, and in turn fear their own slaves will turn against them. They could be encouraged to take up arms and drive the rioters back to their camps."

 goering.803.t:0 "The price of Slaves"
 goering.803.desc:0 "The advantage of slaves is they don't require much training, just a firm hand. They don't cost much to keep, and you don't have to be nice to them. The disadvantage is they have little interest in mastering their craft - only avoiding beatings. This reliance on slaves is beginning to show - the quality of German goods has experienced a noticeable drop, and while unemployment and early retirement remains high there is an increasing drought of skilled workers.\n\nThis quality drop is a symptom of a problem that we are unable to directly address. We must patch as best we can, forcing a diversification of the economy by subsidising technical educations and discouraging our workers from resting on their laurels. Otherwise, this reliance could become a crutch."

 goering.804.t:0 "Keeping Them In Check"
 goering.804.desc:0 "It really is a tangle who owns who these days. The same companies rise and rise, the Junkers and the old guard of German industry stamping on any competition. The Wehrmacht have the right to secure their own contracts in times of need, which they take to mean they can buy an arms factory and give it to a retired officer. They are vital in procuring the Reich's resources, and use this leverage to acquire shares in mines and steel mills and positions on the boards of every company that goes east to the Reichskomissariats. These same companies extend down and down, allowed their influence to extend throughout the economic sphere.\n\nWhile the Wehrmacht is ostensibly loyal, their influence should be checked. Granting loans to smaller businesses outside the military's influence would give them a fighting chance against the oligopolies that dominate our industry. Alternatively we could grant the same contracts that the Heer and Kriegsmarine throw about so carelessly to a foreign company, and attempt to starve the Wehrmacht of their child-businesses."

 goering.805.desc:0 "The Wehrmacht are prickly when others they perceive others stepping on their territory, whether the feeling is warranted or not. Their influence in the economy has grown and grown without signs of stopping, and they are loath to relinquish even an ounce of it to what they see as foreign leeches. Investment from Iberia, Scandinavia and Britain makes up a considerable portion of the same war machine that feeds the Wehrmacht, but they insist that foreign influences be driven out, and German businesses be left to German businessmen.\n\nBowing to the whims of our generals will no doubt deter any future investors, but their support is far too valuable to us."

 goering.806.t:0 "Economic Decline "
 goering.806.desc:0 "With the large majority of Germany's budget being dedicated to the Wehrmacht, one would imagine that this would result in an armed forces decades ahead of its adversaries. In reality, the huge sums of money sunk into the Wehrmacht have done little for tangible improvements of the armed forces, instead being eaten away by corrupt officers and generals, while the remaining sums are spent on outdated or impractical armaments for the over bloated Wehrmacht. \n\n With spending reaching an all time high, civilian industries have been neglected, causing a notable economic decline. Given the military's power, the possibility of actual economic reform is out of the question. We can either bandage the wound with affordable loans to the population, or ride it out and hope for the best. "

 goering.807.desc:0 "It seems like the Banks and their perfidious influence have not taken their long march into irrelevance well. Just recently the various banking houses announced that their rate of interests for further large scale loans has been increased.

 goering.808.t:0 "Civilians invest in the Military-Industrial Complex"
 goering.808.desc:0 "The increasing influence of the Militarists in the Economy has caused a feedback loop. More and more of our substantial civilian investment is being drawn into military controlled and related companies. Now while continued investment is usually a good thing, more investment into the Military makes our economy and the Führers position even more dependent on Schörner and his allies. Maybe the Führer might be better of intervening after all?"

 goering.809.t:0 "Less faith in loads of Cash"
 goering.809.desc:0 "Apparently having currency stability is a factor in trusting that currency. Since the inflation rate of the Reichsmark has increased quite a bit in recent times, the monetary faith has taken a nosedive recently. Unfortunately our options are rather limited unless a scapegoat can be found fast."

But looking at the prices in the stores, they seem to be going in one direction.\n\n Up.\n\n Inflation is rising and if we do nothing it will keep rising. And even after all the events that transpired in more recent history, the memory of the hyperinflation 1923 under the blasted Weimar Republic is still in the subconscious of the Volk. Unfortunately our options are limited:\n\nWe can hope the problem fixes itself of course. Or we can find some Foreign investment that is obviously manipulating our financial markets and keep their currency reserves "safe".\n\nWhat will it be mein Führer?"

 goering.811.desc:0 "The President of the Reichsbank has recently been nagging the Führer about the military's involvement in the banks, complaining that the Wehrmacht has threatened and strong-armed the Reichsbank and its subsidiaries into lower interest rates. President Abs warns of the dire economic consequences if the banks are unable to raise the interest rates, complaining that narrow-minded men like Schörner have no mind for economics or the financial system. \n\nThough we are benefitting from the new interest rates, the growing control of the militarists is concerning, and perhaps President Abs' warnings of doom and gloom have some validity..."

 goering.812.desc:0 "In a meeting with the Führer, major industrial magnates from India have inquired about the possibility of arranging a formal manufacturing deal with both nations. The deal would result in a substantial boost in the manufacturing industry within the Reich, and potentially a cure to treat our ailing economy. The catch is that enacting the deal would open the economy of Germany, and subsequently make us somewhat interdependent with a foreign nation- something disdained by many advocates of autarky in the Reich.

With the people content and the military even happier, the question remains as to how long this growth will last. Passive economics in the halls of the Reich Chancellery have expressed their quiet concerns for the future of the economy, warning that a long, protracted war could yield negative effects. "

 goering.815.desc:0 "With the necessity of high production, the workers have experienced deteriorating conditions and harsher discipline. There are even cases of workers dropping dead during work days due to being overworked. This of course has lead to sporadic protests and strikes.

Having overrun their masters through sheer numerical advantage, many have looted local arms deposits, acquiring large amounts of armaments. With the military currently preoccupied, only local police forces have been able to assemble near the affected areas, and are currently in no way in position to directly liquidate the rebels. \n\nPolice forces will eventually put down the revolt, but at the expense of significant and infrastructural and economic damage to the areas affected.

 goering.817.desc:0 "The war has dragged out for far too long, and the banks have begun to grow anxious- even pulling out previous investments in the defense sector. This has infuriated the Wehrmacht, demanding they reign in the banks' decision and prevent the investments from being pulled. Giving into the militarists' demand would keep up the flow of cash, but that would mean greater Wehrmacht control over the economy."

 goering.899.d:0 ""The headquarters of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht are abuzz with activity. In the central meeting room, all branches of the mighty armed forces of the resurgent Reich are represented around the table where the once-proud nation starts to reclaim its destiny. With the Bürgerkrieg over, the first and foremost task is to reclaim the closest lands to the proper Reich, the "greater" in the Greater Germany: more than a matter of pride, regions such as Bohemia and the Netherlands are home to important industrial hubs that will prove fundamental in future expansion plans.\n\nDozens of generals and admirals surround a large, rectangular table, whose head is currently occupied by two men in high uniform. The Führer, Hermann Göring, and his right-hand man, Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, look intently at the maps spread in front of them, though only one of them actually understands what they mean: despite his experience as a pilot ace, Hermann Göring has never been a general, and rather than maps, he prefers paintings, which he deems a much better use of canvas.\n\n"Gentlemen" begins the Feldmarschall, rousing the crowd from their ruminations.\n"The Reich still stands, but our empire has fallen apart. Without the resources and the manpower provided by the former Reichskommissariate, our war machine will never be able to recover in full: if we want to reclaim our right as Aryan masters of the world, then we need to strike now!" the Führer applauds his small speech, immediately followed by the rest of the Oberkommando.\n"It should be immediately evident to all of you how our most immediate targets should be these" he says, pointing his fingers at several highlighted nations. Denmark, Holland, Bohemia, Ostland, Poland and Slovakia.\n"These "nations" were the most closely integrated with the Reich, and are still reeling from the chaos of the rebellions. Some of them might yet be saved, but most will fight. If so, gentlemen, we'll give them what we want. For Germany!" he finishes, and everyone cheers with him.""

Though we may not have expected to die on foreign soil, we must not let ourselves waver in the face of death outside of our homeland, and we will lay down our lives without fear!" \n\nA soft applause filled the hall. Though every man clapped, there was no fervour. Half the hall was abandoned. The men who once sat in these empty seats were dead, slaughtered at the hands of the men who still held their power. Soon, all the hall would be abandoned, as Göring had announced his intentions to invade Böhmen-Mähren. \n\nDaleuge sat at his desk, motionless. He had it. He had his power. Maybe it was not where he wanted to be, but right now, everyone answered to him. And that was all he wanted. Now, some bloated, jumped-up warlord who calls himself the Führer of all Germans wanted to take this power that he had worked so hard for, and all that Daleuge could do was watch. Though no weakness would be shown to his men, he knew what the outcome of this war would be. At least he had the opportunity to make life as miserable for that gorged fool as he possibly could. He looked back at the papers in front of him, then tentatively he pulled a map from the drawer next to his desk. For a second, he hesitated, questioning his own authority; but he reassured himself that he was the only authority in Böhmen-Mähren. Daleuge began to draw a battle plan. \n\nAs the SS regiments marched out of Prag, they did so with discipline, but without spirit. The same men who marched in to end the Böhmen-Mähren authority now marched out to protect it. A somewhat vain show of force before the storm.

In Böhmen-Mähren, both in remote farms in the hills and in dark warehouses in the outskirts of the cities, a resistance fights. Not one of the futile untermenschen causes that have plagued the Reich, but a heroic German Resistance. A resistance of heroes, relegated to the shadows. The Mähren-based resistance is led by one Rudolf Toussaint; a veteran of the First Great War who has since dutifully served his country during the Second World War, and this loyalty was unfazed by the succession of Führer Göring. He is the perfect candidate to lead our operations on the inside. \n\n"Herr Schörner. It is good to hear from you". Toussaint grimaced his peers in the room upon hearing the gravelly Bavarian accent on the other end of the line. Unsurprisingly. he found himself on the receiving end of a barrage of orders which his assistant hastily wrote down, whilst Toussaint could do nothing but agree. Eventually Schörner was done, and the call ended, without the resistance giving a single point of note back to the commander.\n\n The room awoke in a calm, but passionate, debate. Toussaint's old guard emphasised caution in the face of Germany and wanted to toe Schörner's line, whilst the newer officers promoted after the fall of the garrison wanted to try and make contact with a general who would actually listen to the resistance. Nothing came of the debate. Everyone stuck to their positions, and Toussaint eventually dismissed the entire room. No good would ever come of divisions. \n\n Quietly sitting at his desk, Toussaint looked over his plans, then over Schörner's plans. Not much use in his own plans now. If he worked against Schörner's orders he would certainly be shot for treason as soon as the army caught up with him. But he was loyal to Germany no matter who that meant answering to. "

Some men faced death without fear, whilst others broke down, but Rudolf had never seen a man face it with such anger. He raised his rifle and fired three shots into the soldier's chest. The soldier's anger was extinguished, and his sternness disappeared as he slumped back over the bed, dead. \n\nSlinging his rifle over his shoulder, Rudolf surveyed the barracks. About twenty beds. Besides each of them, a small drawer, presumably the only possessions the SS soldiers owned. A swastika on one end of the room, and the Black Sun on the other. No windows. There had to be something of worth in here, since there was nothing in the rest of the village; surely the SS couldn't have sent it all back to Prag? \n\nFor the next hour, he searched every drawer and found little. A few pictures; siblings? Loved ones? Could the SS even feel love anymore? He found one pocket watch, presumably an heirloom. Might as well keep that one, he supposed. There were a few books, mostly filled with the ravings of that lunatic Himmler. Rudolf put them to one side, so it would be easier to burn them later. These men lived with next to nothing; no cards, no memories of home, just their uniforms and their hatred. He was beginning to feel frustrated by the time he reached the last drawer, before tugging it and realising it was locked. A grin spread over his face as he took the butt of his rifle and slammed it into the drawer, which promptly burst open. \n\nInside the drawer was a wealth of jewellery, gold, gemstones, rings, every precious thing that man could create.

Petty despots like Daleuge would scatter before him as he swept through Europe, crushing all those who dared resist his might. \n\n'Herr Schörner'. His assistant's voice was firm. Schörner was always sure to pick out assistants that wouldn't fear him; fear was inevitably followed by incompetence. 'We've had a series of reports about SS partisans who refuse to give up the fight. Our divisions across Böhmen-Mähren are waiting for orders. Should we hunt them down?' \n\nThe wind on the balcony picked up slightly, rippling through the swastika that now hung above the headquarters. Schörner's face did not stir. Finally, he spoke. \n\n'Hunt them to the last man. Spare no one. Keep three of our divisions stationed here, assisting the garrison. Delegate them to another commander.' A slight trace of a smile crept over Schörner's face; it wouldn't be perceptible to most, but this was a significant display of emotion for the orthodox general. 'The rest of the divisions will leave the day after tomorrow, along with ourselves. We're moving onto the next target.' Schörner hesitated. 'If they find Daleuge, tell me. I'd like to see him.

An untermenschen under the Reich? That would be a stain that cannot be wiped from our nation! The reaction from the hardcore militarists are one and the same. We cannot trust him, and the only way we should be even considering dealing with Vituska is with a bullet! With the new focus of the Reich being conquest to make us great again, it seems as though this would be in keeping with the policy we promised Germany. \n\nBut another band of less hardline officers has suggested the unthinkable; accept the proposal, undermine Vituska's authority, then eventually integrate Ostland again. While this seems a wild breach of the militarist belief that won us the civil war, there is an element of reason in their plan; we can spare Ostland from a second wave of destruction that would no doubt leave the colony far behind the rest of the Reich in industrial strength and Germanisation. \n\nThe final decision rests on the shoulders of the Führer.

Of course, this exchange will be far more useful for us than for Vituska, and his army is as much of an unknown quantity as he is so any information on their weaknesses will bevital for keeping him trustworthy. \n\nIt may seem counterintuitive to undermine the militarists, the Führer's closest allies and his backers in the civil war. But Herr Schörner is beginning to believe he holds the keys to the Reich. If we were to reduce his officers to mere diplomats to Vituska's regime, it would reduce his power in the metropole and send a message that the Führer still holds the reins. Schörner himself does not seem shaken by rumours of this proposal; perhaps he has finally learned his place! \n\nAlternatively, we could simply send neutral officers to take part in the exchange. Vituska would possibly hand over better information if this were the case, as it certainly helps to negotiate with men who aren't openly calling for your blood; but Vituska is utterly unpredictable, so who can say what he truly wants. This would leave more power in the hands of the militarists, but isn't that what we fought for?"

This situation cannot continue. \n\nWe may not trust Vituska entirely, but he is working with us now. Ostland is his realm, and so he is the man who must protect it. If we sent his desperately under equipped forces weapons then we may be able to achieve true lasting stability in Ostland and root out the partisans once and for all. \n\nOf course, it isn't that simple. If we were to send Vituska as many arms as we can spare, his forces would likely be more effective and could even defend themselves against threats from Moskowien; it would also help build Vituska's trust for us. However, this is putting our arms in the hands of a dangerously unpredictable man, and perhaps it would be best if we only send enough arms to put down the partisan menace, not enough to defy our will."

While Germany had been busy tearing itself apart, the jackals in the SS had leapt onto the similarly stricken corpse of Ostland, and now a black tumor grew on the side of the Reich. Invasion was a no brainer- it had always been the plan to integrate Ostland into the Reich one day- but it pained Göring to need to waste German lives on a territory that was once an easy landgrab. He needed to make it easier- the less lives lost, the better.\n\nAn idea came to mind. Certainly not all Germans in Ostland were fans of Jeckeln's maniacal regime. After all, were they not just fighting him? They may not have much in common, but something that could generally unite Germans of all walks of life was their distaste for the SS. Certainly, Göring and his men could find some veterans brave enough to rally themselves for the return of order and the purge of the madness that the SS brought.\n\nThe idea crystallized in his head, and Göring smiled. Remer and his men would infiltrate the Ostland border, searching for militarist contacts. Once there, they would form their own units, ready to sew chaos behind enemy lines. These infiltrations would not only make the war a thousand times more manageable, but would shorten it drastically. Besides, Göring reasoned, even if the plan did not fully pan out, it would rid him of Remer for at least some time."

Simple diplomacy. \n\nAn lone, inconspicuous black car pulled out the airfield carrying the most powerful man in Ostland. As he looked out onto the wheat fields he thought about the exchange. Perhaps he could've gotten more out of it. Vituska tended to find opportunity simply presented itself to a man, and nothing about the exchange has given him true opportunity.

It was a dull patrol, and though the Gemeiner would inevitably suffer some harsh consequences for his words, they somewhat enjoyed hearing his anger. Schörner had ears everywhere however, as the Gemeiner would no doubt learn in the coming days. \n\nAs they turned the corner, the Gemeiner was grumbling over the uselessness of patrolling Riga. He had just called it the safest city in the Reich when a group of masked men materialised from open doorways and side alleys. The German soldiers couldn't even raise their rifles. Gunshots echoed from the hollow buildings, rising in violent cacophony and then falling silent.

They then wiped the world clean of evidence of this crime, and the Führer was astounded to get the call that all the plotters had simply disappeared, vanished without a trace. \n\nThe anti-militarist inner circle speaks in more hushed tones now, but the messages from their lips are one and the same.

The new Führer, Göring, had marched over those loyal to the Reich with as little mercy as he had with those disloyal to the Reich. \n\nNow Hans fought for the wrong side. They had taken his farmstead and his family. They had taken his patriotism. He wasn't a soldier of the Reich anymore. He was a partisan. A measly partisan fighting his own homeland.

The Ost-Germans have brought the virility of the Aryan race to this backwater, sowing the fertile seeds of the German people in the rich farmlands and verdant forests. With plenty of colonists present, the racially acceptable natives being rapidly assimilated and the remainder pushed to the fringes of society, the Führer has seen fit to formally integrate these parts of Ostland into the Reich.

Accordingly, the aggressive pursuit of Germanization can slow down to a more measured pace. The Führer's reasoning is simple: with their will to fight repeatedly broken and a strong German presence established, the natives pose no threat at this point and their assimilation or displacement is so certain that the Reich can finally afford to ease up, redirecting resources to more pressing matters. The integration of the remaining parts of Ostland, be they majority-German or native, is to commence immediately and without hesitation. Our race will win out in these areas soon enough."

Reichskommissariat Ostland has returned to the fold and its economy is recovering well, but many prominent Ostlanders have been petitioning Berlin for additional investment. A dose of cash delivered on the Führer's order would certainly help create more jobs and send a positive message to private investors, but there is another matter to consider: the loyalty of Drechsler's officer corps.

The fact that this man was a long-serving member of our great establishment does not excuse his betrayal of the Reich and the German race. Loyalty and trust is measured by one's dedication to the Führer and the willingness to obey unquestioningly. That Drechsler refused the Führer's direct order to stand down from his unlawfully claimed post should be reason enough for all to join in condemnation of his actions and purge his memory from the rolls of the NSDAP.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that nobody expected treason from such a widely-known and well-respected man - an ex-Gauleiter and veteran of the Sturmabteilung, no less. The Führer recognises the reality of Drechsler's popularity and wishes to ameliorate your concerns by assuring each and every one of you that he acted only out of necessity, not for any petty political gain. The Führer is above such temptations and has only the greater good of the Reich in mind when acting in his capacity as father to the nation.

There would, many realised, be a lot more shouting later in the day if that outburst was any indication.\n\nHours later, Field Marshal Schörner downed the phone, hooked directly to the Chancellery, with a satisfied smile. He had known, of course, about Göring's peaceful overtures towards Stahlecker. For a time, he had been concerned - it was an open secret that Göring had no interest in so-called 'pointless' wars or anything beyond enriching himself and enjoying the perks of his office. This, however, was the first step towards changing that. It would take some time, yes - but if he were to be pulled deep enough into the Field Marshal's machinations, he would soon find himself too bogged down to even think about defying the will of the armed forces again. Then, and only then, would the Reich's invincibility be ensured."

The few brave enough to attempt to eavesdrop in the thirty seconds that the men spent with the Führer heard no exchange of words; no indignant shouts or threats of arrest, nor snide, practiced military snobbery. When the officers left, the only apparent change was the absence of an envelope, stamped with the mark of OKW, that had previously been carried in a worn and scarred hand.\n\nGöring had been expecting such an outrageous move in response to his decision to pursue peace with Stahlecker, however. There had been no exchange of words for precisely that reason; the Panzergrenadiers had their orders, and Göring had been informed of their arrival hours in advance. With all the pieces so clearly laid out, there was no need for words - only a silent understanding.\n\nThe letter was clear in its wording. Cold, uncaring and professional - straight from the desk of Field Marshal Schörner. "Army High Command," it read, "Is deeply concerned by recent decisions made by the Führer. As the unquestionable defenders of the Greater Germanic Reich, we wish to express our hesitance to endorse the Führer's refusal to employ a practical solution to the renegade colony of Ostland. We recommend the immediate issue of an ultimatum demanding total submission and compliance to the self-proclaimed authority therein, under threat of military intervention. We expect that the Führer will wholeheartedly endorse this measure and carry it out post-haste.\n\nSieg heil!"

Any action taken against Ostland, military or otherwise, will now be legally justified and much more palatable to the Reich's citizens. Now, Göring is under pressure not just from OKW, but from many civilians in his administration and cabinet. A self-proclaimed Reichskommissar has refused his orders and set his men on a belligerent stance against us - how can we possibly react with anything but swift and bloody retribution?\n\nWith rather pointed words, apparently. So claims Göring, at least. Still set on avoiding bloodshed despite Stahlecker's insult, the Führer has expressed his belief that the renegade can be brought to heel. His logic is sound, at least: Stahlecker, as a Bormannite, values Germanic unity above all else. The shedding of Aryan blood is anathema to him and it was a wonder that he even found the willpower to push through the Ostland civil war in the first place. Yet, deep down, he is no true soldier; he lacks a military awareness of war's realities. Demonstrate to him in no uncertain terms what war with the Reich would entail, and he will fold. The Führer has received a certain amount of support for this idea, even from elements of the Wehrmacht, but wonders aloud if it's worth the effort."

Concerns have been expressed by certain ill-educated economists that the demand for Ostland's economy to be placed in the hands of Germania's bureaucrats was a step too far and that it will have disastrous consequences for the colony, but the Führer is happy to be done with the whole messy affair.

They didn't report anything unusual upon returning to base, but one of our infantry patrols reported seeing smoke rising from a Lithuanian village just over the border. Recon aircraft quickly confirmed that the village of approximately 400 civilians had been razed to the ground, with no signs of life remaining besides some wandering cattle. This particular village had not previously been of any interest to us due to its lack of defenses - Schörner claims provocation by partisans and the Ostland garrison, however, stating that his men were defending themselves.\n\nThe Führer is outraged by this impropriety, but that may well have been the intended result. There is little publicly available evidence of our forces' involvement in the attack, so certain elements of the militarist cabinet are urging him to turn the incident into a propaganda offensive to aid a coup against Stahlecker which is currently in the works (which is the first that the Führer has heard of such a thing). The Führer, for his part, would rather just pretend the incident didn't happen at all, to avoid any disruption to his war of words with Stahlecker - he is certain that his plan will still bear fruit.\n\nThe army, however, makes no secret of the fact that they bear responsibility, and is pushing for the Führer to authorize a second raid to undermine Stahlecker further.

Our pilots fought bravely and with great skill, but were outnumbered by ten to two. A loss was inevitable, with Lieutenant Wilhelm Kurtz being shot down over hostile territory. Thankfully his wingman made it back to base, but the damage is done. Even as the Luftwaffe mourns this loss, their allies in the Heer are baying for blood, now that there is proof of Stahlecker's hostile intentions.\n\nThe Führer is now under immense pressure to issue the invasion order, as continuing with attempts to intimidate Stahlecker will now infuriate the Luftwaffe as well as the Heer.

How the Führer learned of the plot is unknown, but the assumption is that Stahlecker himself was involved.\n\nYet there has been no move on the Führer's part, nor a counterattack by the militarists. The officers were permitted to leave the building, thoroughly shaken but unharmed. Whatever they said to the Führer, it was enough to give him momentary pause. Could it be that he has resolved not to take action against the plotters, despite their gross insubordination and betrayal of one of their own?

The militarists are dangerous, yes, but their most recent plot may have gone too far even for their ambition.

Stahlecker has promised that mutual recognition of legitimacy is all he ever sought, and that he will serve the Reich "...faithfully, for life, and unto death." For his part, the Führer had this to say:\n\n"We live in trying times. Loyalties are constantly put to the test in unexpected ways, as are one's commitments to one's ideals. The recent disagreements between the Reich and her colony are the result of unfortunate circumstances and the realities of the day. It is tragic that loss of life occurred as a consequence, but with this agreement a great deal more bloodshed has been avoided.

Piles of weapons, vacated bunkers and abandoned motor pools line every highway and no small number of garrison troops have simply vanished into the woods, either heading for home or abandoning their cause altogether. Their fate makes no difference now.\n\nStahlecker and his staff are now heading by plane for Germania, no longer employees of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Indeed, the Reichskommissariat no longer exists as of this moment; now formally dissolved as a separate entity, all Aryan Ostlanders are now full citizens of the Reich and the colony's treasury has been snatched up by the Führer's financiers. A number of economists have expressed concern at this seizure of the colony, claiming that it is 'unprepared for integration'. This is nonsense, of course - the Führer has great expertise in economic matters. There may be some teething issues, true, but give it a few days and the colony will be more prosperous than ever."

The invasion can no longer be stopped, despite Göring's best efforts. Any order to hold fast would likely fall on deaf ears, as Schörner is past tolerating attempts at 'peace' and 'unity' for the time being.\n\nWar returns to Ostland; it will be swift, brutal and merciless. Anyone who knows the lay of the land and the disposition of the Wehrmacht could accurately predict that tens of thousands are likely to die, innocent or otherwise.

While no doubt amusing to the rank and file, he has a surprising amount of sway; not over Stahlecker, who remains as stoic as ever, but over the people of Ostland. The last thing we want in the event of successful negotiations is for the Ostlanders to rise up against our rule and render the whole peace process completely moot.\n\nThe Abwehr has pointed out that with the chaotic situation in Ostland, it would be child's play to remove this obnoxious individual from the equation. Even better, we have a man in Riga - a survivor of Drechsler's cabinet - who has spent the past few months schmoozing with his former enemies, who are unaware of his past loyalties. By pulling a few strings, passing fistfuls of marks to the right people and disposing of the troublesome individual in question, the Abwehr is confident that we can get our man into Stahlecker's confidence and start chipping away at the resistance from within.\n\n"

Of course, it was apparently too little too late for the Wehrmacht, who have once again called for an invasion of Ostland. They refer to the man's anti-militarist rhetoric as 'subversive, disrespectful and indicative of the general company that Stahlecker keeps'.\n\nThe prospect of invading over insults - especially when the one responsible has been fired! - is obviously ridiculous to any level-headed individual, but the Wehrmacht is rarely a bastion of balanced, rational thought these days.

The same is true for the entirety of Ostland - everywhere, the garrison and Orpo are back on their routine patrols (though with fresh faces among them), farmers tend their crops and factories begin to churn out goods for sale back in the Reich. Even the non-Aryan natives seem mildly appreciative of the situation; they might be on the fringes of society, but at least they aren't being shot at by the SS or murdered by partisans for not being anti-German enough.\n\nIn his office, refurbished with new furniture from Germania befitting his now-official status, Stahlecker allowed himself to recline with a satisfied smile. This is what it was for - all the unpleasant things he did in the SS, the civil war, the tense negotiations with a Führer he had little in common with. This vision of peace and stability, so thoroughly devalued in recent years, made it all worthwhile.

He has apparently escaped any kind of discipline for this.\n\nThe Führer's response to this story was little more than a world-weary sigh.

On the other end of the line was Schörner's aide, who hesitantly stated that the Field Marshal "...favors immediate military action to, uh... to avenge this insult and - what was it, sir? - uh, and the sullying of the image of the Reich's glorious leaders."\n\nEveryone is a little confused at this point.

The driver slammed on the brakes, and the three men leapt out of their seats, chasing him into a dark alley.\n\nAs the man ran for the next road, he realized his mistake- the alley had nowhere to take cover, nothing to hide behind. The point was punctuated with three sharp cracks of gunfire lighting up the walls like a camera flash, and the man collapsed with a thud. One man rolled him over with his foot, comparing the image to the corpse, nodding to his colleagues when he confirmed the target.

Surely you would know him by reputation, at least; the man is famously infatuated with the subhumans of eastern Europe in a manner that goes beyond mere academic fascination. His loyalty has been suspect for years, but the Gestapo were never able to find conclusive evidence to bring charges of treason against him. It is likely that his significant personal fortune was the means by which he evaded the law - were we to conduct a thorough investigation, we would likely turn up many a Gestapo officer with greasy palms.\n\nMeyer-Landrut is no military man, but his betrayal of Aryan ideals has wooed many Balts and Slavs, who now fight for him along with our traitor kin. More significantly, of course, he represents a serious ideological threat as the last holdout of Speerism. My Führer, it is this agency's concern that as long as this traitor to the Fatherland and National Socialism remains active, the legitimacy of the Reich is threatened. It is Field Marshal Schörner's view that immediate action against this final pocket of resistance within the Reich proper is necessary, before the poison of liberalism finds root within our society again."

Those who survived the war were all too easy to find. Often accompanied by their staff - no doubt indoctrinated into obedience - many were caught and arrested in their own homes or officers, desperately burning one document after another to try and protect themselves.\n\nWith the owners of some of Germany's biggest banks and businesses apprehended, it was a simple matter to rubber-stamp the paperwork necessary to seize their assets and transfer them to the Führer's personal control. The agents who brought in the snakes each received a commendation and a hefty bonus, cut from the wealth of their quarries. Doubtless we shall need such keen minds when the time comes to pursue such foes of the Reich once more.

Shortly after the news broke in the morning papers, the Wehrmacht's press office released a statement confirming that two squads of Pioneers from the 44th Grenadier Division stormed the empty factory at approximately 5:00 AM with orders to carry out the demolition of the entire structure. The factory was, according to 'reliable sources', being used as a hideout for a large SS cell. More importantly, it allegedly produced weapons for the traitors, with the entire workforce being implicated by the Wehrmacht's informants. Accordingly, the Pioneer units placed demolition charges around the factory in the hours before the first workers arrived, only detonating them once a majority of the workforce was confirmed to be on the clock. An attempt to dig for survivors in the rubble was repelled by the timely arrival of a large Feldgendarmerie contingent, who sealed off the site and declared that more Pioneers would soon be arriving to apply further explosives in order to 'collapse any subterranean construction'.\n\n"I don't understand," said a passing civilian when asked for comment. "That place was a brick factory. There aren't even any armaments factories in the whole of Riga. I've worked in both kinds of factories and I can tell you that there's no confusing brick-making equipment for gunsmithing tools."

"Your boy got back to you quickly, didn't he?" Despite their differing cultures, Dietrich and his family had been accepted with relative warmth. So far out from the major centres of civilisation and its tracts of arable land, there had been little objection to a lone colonial family moving into an abandoned woodland home. Someone had to keep the deer in check, after all.\n\n"He did." Dietrich motioned to the blasted tangle of steel and wood half-buried in the mud right in the middle of the road, where there had previously been a minor railway running through the forest. "He couldn't say what it was you wanted me to see, but it certainly speaks for itself."\n\n"Yes. I wondered, given your time in service, if you would know how this happened?" There was a pause as the German scratched at the graying stubble on his chin and went rummaging through memories of 20 years prior. Given the thoroughly wrecked state of the rails and three-foot-deep crater, it could only have been done with military-grade demolition charges.\n\n"Small but strong railbusting charges," he finally said. "Only Pioneer units are equipped with those. The soldiers who passed through yesterday must have been scouting for vulnerable points in the railway like this crossing." With a sigh, he walked over and began picking up bits of planks littering the road. "Come on, Simas. Let's get this as clear as we can so people can bring their trucks through.

His eyes were shrouded in shadow by the pillar of flame, and its wicked light glimmered on the brass buttons of the other soldiers as they turned to look at Armin.

Our troops silently moved and surrounded the whole village under the cover of darkness. And suddenly, a gunshot broke the stillness and when those rebel scums realized what happened, there is no way out for them. Realizing they were doomed tonight, they made stiff resistance against our forces, but no matter how indomitable they pretended to be, they cannot hold against our advanced equipment and numerical superiority.\n\nWhen the first ray of dawn comes upon the vast territory of Mosowien, the whole village was burnt into ground.

As a result, the future cooperation between the Reich and the partisans is now nothing but a sweet and unrealistic dream. And to crown it all, the Russians are just in need of those equipment and it will make them even more difficult to defeat in the future.\n\nSuch an awkward result is uncourtly a great hit of our fatherland, and even the whole world is laughing at our folly right now, for the Russians have declared that they've "frustrate an insidious plot of the German government and the Germans will stew their own juice".

This milestone shows that even the heart of what once was a nest of venomous, rabidly anti-German dogs can transform under the guidance of the Reich.\n\nAs expected, the Reich can expect an influx of new Swiss recruits to join in on the future efforts to project German influence not only in Europe, but across the globe. With Bern now safely under the thumb of the Reich, surely the rest of the Swiss people will make peace with their new leaders."

While certainly these tactics have shocked many Swiss and have furthered disdain for their new leaders, it has unquestionably stopped the Swiss guerillas dead in their tracks most literally.\n\nWith what appears to be the end of the Swiss guerilla war, resources may now be focused elsewhere to further project the interests of the Reich.

Facing the same enemies, an alliance was once built up between us during our last invasion. And now, as the European situation quickly changes, it seems the alliance need to be rekindled for our mutual benefits. \n\n Lucky for us, their organization aren't difficult to find, and our spies were easily able to make contact with them. They showed little trust toward us at first, claiming that we had betrayed them when the Italians invaded their motherland and set up their own puppet government. regime. But after a few minutes, our agents successfully showed them that Italians are also our enemies and for now we indeed need each other to overthrow the Communist regime in their land and have their revenge against the Italians in the future. So, the proposal of an alliance finally got approved by the leader of the Ustase Organization at the end of the meeting. \n\n However, for Germany, there is still one fatal decision to be made. Of course, we can keep our words about an independent Croatian nation in the future and send them supplies they need in the upcoming uprising, for that will definitely make them loyal to us. But on the other hand, if they're so easy to trust us again, maybe some sweet talk and vague promises will be enough to get them on another side.

Thus, a special delegate has been order to get on to them and persuade them to join our side in the upcoming war. \n\n As our Führer wisely expected, the negotiation went even more smoothly than our generals' imagination. The Bosnians quickly accept our offer, for the Yugoslavian communist regime is not only the enemy of the German Reich, as they said, but also an enemy of all Bosnian patriots. In order to win the independence of the long-oppressed Bosnian nation, they are willing to join our forces and take our orders in our invasion, as long as we can protect them from their evil neighbors. \n\n The orders, however, haven't be given to them yet. The easiest choice is to just give them supplies and help them organize a great national uprising once our panzers start to march into the Yugoslavian lands, since it can greatly distract the Yugoslavian armies and make our invasion much easier. But some generals hold different opinion, saying the Bosnian nationalists will be quickly wiped out if they just declare a rebellion, and they can cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian government if they can keep underground and do some sabotage works.

Finally, they had to admit that we are the only forces that can help them fulfill their dream and agreed on our terms, as long as we grant their restoration after the war. \n\n Now, it is time for us to decide whether should we keep words about assistance. It is true that providing them what they need and allow them have their monarchy will make them appreciated and loyal to us. But some suggest that what we need is only to have them distract the communist government, and since the Chetniks cannot even drive the commies out from their own land, they don't really deserve to have a role in our Balkan post-war order.

Because the communists are hunting them down at any cost, they currently have no other choices but to entrust their fate to us. Therefore, they easily accept our proposal, saying that they're more than honored to get the second chance to work with the Reich. At the end of our meeting, they told us that they had already organized some political dissents and ready to take our orders. \n\n Now, as we've successfully made connection with them, it's time for us to decide which role they will play in our invasion plan. The first choice is to let them organize a national uprising, which will greatly reduce the resistance on the front. However, we can also let them do some underground activities and sabotages.

Now, with the Germans behind them, the NSNAP resumed control.\n\nOffices once held by NSNAP officials were restocked with staunch hardliners, government policy was replaced with the old ways, and the focus of the Dutch government once again shifted back to their original task- quick, seamless integration with the Greater Reich. Though Germanization progress was certainly dealt a setback in the last years, the new government is wasting no time in recovering their progress and marching onwards. With luck, we may even see the Netherlands integrated as a part of Germany proper within the next few years."

With our massive fleet of battleships, destroyers, and frigates roaring by, they will surely see the light and join us. Of course, however, this is not a sure thing. It is believed within the Oberkommando that, if our maneuvers are too small or too concentrated, the Finns will either ignore it or, if they are feeling foolish, attempt to counter our movements. While Göring firmly believes the Finns would never be so utterly stupid as to counter the might of the Reich, the Finnish government has always been known for its rather foolhardy streak. A confrontation in the Baltic Sea could lead to a war before we are ready.\n\nOn the other hand, running so many ships at once will cost an absolute fortune in fuel, and that's not even factoring in the Luftwaffe's attempts to be involved in these exercises. The bigger the exercise, the higher the cost, and with the shape of the economy, perhaps spending hundreds of millions of marks to threaten someone is not the best move.

Unsurprisingly, Schörner and his clique have argued mercilessly for this, though some even wish to simply attack their navy either way.

Now, as the Finnish Navy grew closer and closer, he cursed the fool who had sent him on this doomed expedition.\n\nThe first shell sailed over the flagship, detonating about 500 meters behind them, and the radio began to clatter. Sirens wailed as men rushed to battle stations, and the Captain wondered what wrong he had committed to get him locked into such a suicidal posting. Indeed, even as the guns began to roar a response to the Finn's attack, the admiral knew it was a doomed effort. After all, this was the Finnish navy at nearly its full might, brought to enforce its waters and, presumable, remind Göring of who held the power. It was almost as if they were bait, or perhaps cannon fodder. The admiral could only hold onto his railing and pray for a mercifully quick end. Perhaps he would be able to take a few Finnish ships with him.\n\nSuddenly, a siren rose and stood out among the chaos. The admiral's head shot up to see a magnificent sight- the Luftwaffe's bombers, suspended in mid-air like raptors descending upon their first prey of the day. Below them, the Finns belatedly tried to dodge and weave, but their ships were too heavy and their reactions too slow, and the leading ships went up in flames. They were not the last.\n\nBy the end of the skirmish, thousands of Finns sank to their watery graves, and their boats went with them.

He was not yet at his destination.\n\nFinally, as he quickly stepped over the body of a dead soldier, Linkwitz reached his spot. The wind whipped the hill as a platoon of soldiers struggled with a flagpole. Above them, the Finnish flag waved defiantly and proudly, refusing to fall as the islands had. Finally, in a bout of frustration, one soldier stepped back and emptied a magazine into the flag.

His smile grew as he imagined the pictures he would take- shattered bunkers with triumphant soldiers above them, the swastika over the islands, lines of Finnish prisoners- a propagandists dream.\n\nSuddenly, a light washed over the deck of the boat, and the side of the boat was shredded with machine gun fire. Boats erupted into flames as confused men poured over the side and into the icy waters of the Baltic.

Before Lappland, these problems were entirely unassailable, due to our constant rhetoric about how the Wehrmacht is the best on earth. Now, with the cover of "training our men for our next conquest", we have the perfect opportunity to remove the worst offenders from our ranks.\n\nUnfortunately for our plans, it seems the militarists have caught some wind of this scheme, and have stepped in to stop it before we got too far. Reportedly, Schörner and his clique are furious with the Reichstag and the Führer, as many Schörnerites have been caught up in this.

This plan sounds very easy and plain when proposed, but now when we wish to implement it, it seems that the problems with this plan are far more complex than it looks. And among them, the first and most important one is, who our friends should be?\n\nFor a long time, there've been a number of Germanophiles who wish to establish an Alliance between England and German, and thanks to their existence, we can easily set up a puppet state during the Second World War and firmly controlled the England for more than 20 years. Thus, if we wish to find friends in England, they will be our first choice in all of our people's eyes. However, the debate is over the cooperation with the wilder resistance who may not like us but still oppose the currently English regime for different reasons. Some believes that the hardline collaborators are too slim and the more help we can find, the more our achievements will become in the end. Others, however, believes that those dissents who don't sympathize with our national socialist cause cannot be trusted, and their involvement will cause more harm than good if we absorb them into our alliance.\n\nObviously, both sides have their own points. But for now, our time is limited and we should take our decision as soon as possible no matter what it is. The higher risk will surely bring higher success rate, and it is the Führer's responsibility to make the final trade-offs. And his final choice is that..."

In one word, all our previous efforts were proved to be in vain at last.\n\nWe still don't know how this happened, but it is certain that our recent sabotages and attacks were so frequent and large that have attracted the English military intelligence department long before this incident. As a result, every act and every move we taken were under their close surveillance, and when their preparation was done, the doomsday of the rebels had come. Overnight, almost every agent we assigned and every holdout we contacted was arrest in their hideout and all valuable materials we sent were looted as well. Though a few lucky ones survived such a disaster and would continue to fight against the English government, everyone is clear that our plan has totally failed.\n\nNow while the Führer is deeply annoyed about such a failure, there was a heated quarrel between our general staff and ministers. Those who proposed to implement subversive methods still resist the practicability of their strategy, but most have lost their patience in them, declaring that the Englishmen cannot be trusted and military invasion is the only way we can take now.

Those documents told us that they've been receiving assistance and orders from Germania and their ultimate goal is to subvert our government and give England back to those bloodthirsty intruders. Out of anger, our fighters immediately executed those traitors after learning this information, and quickly told their superiors about everything they've found.\n\nWe have to admit that, realizing what the Germans are planning has angered but still worried many of us a lot. While we will never be afraid of facing those monstrous bastards, we still must be very careful since we've only retaken England for a short time and our country is far from stable and strong. Thus, we can continue to invest those German spies and their copycats and swept them out once we're ready.

However, what they always failed to understand is how complex international politics and business can be. \n\nIn fact, the Führer and other rational ministers are all clear that, when we look at the big picture, this trial is about to set the tone for our occupation for at least 5 years, if we are too harsh now, we may have to face much more fierce resistance later. And if that's not enough, most of the generals and their freedom fighters have connection with foreign companies, which means if we can talk with them, we will have a better chance to implement our foreign policies later. \n\nIn the end, like all the dilemmas we've faced before, there's no perfect choice in the end.

He fought with the losing side of the Great War, then the losing side of the Silesian Uprisings. He was then discharged from the Reichswehr, forced to a lowly border guard position. \n\nFrom there, his luck appeared to grow. He was accepted into the Nazi party, then the Schutzstaffel, rising through the ranks and even serving in the Reichstag and as leader of several SS main districts. His country even won a war. As a Moskowien field marshal, he might not have inhabited the most glorious of the Reich's offices, but it was a place of belonging all the same. Even in the poor climate of the German Civil War, Erich sought to write his name in history and reunited the fragmented Reichkomissariat under his leadership, with Göring's help, of course. Fate, however, plays cruel tricks on men like Erich. \n\nBitter whispers fill the Russian air today, as Erich has found himself with a round of bullets carelessly embedded in his skull. Werner Mummert, good friend to Schörner, has been rather quickly ushered into the empty Moskowien throne, and rumour has it that the Führer was not consulted.

The thought of this being a case of military fratricide is a terrifying one indeed, but it will be noted that the assassin's entrance into the Reichskommisar's mansion would seem most unlikely unless he had help from the inside.

Debriefing - or interrogation - of surviving infantrymen describes a military folly of a magnitude painful to even consider. Enemy grenadiers and saboteurs disabled or destroyed dozens of vehicles, to say nothing of the now-smoking corpses inside of them, and were obscured from retaliatory airstrikes by trees and terrain. Further, past Luftwaffe bombings destroyed all roads and ingresses to vital areas, and intelligence did not consider this when creating the tactical plans causing entire armored columns to become stuck and having to abandon their vehicles for fear of enemy capture.

As many troops as we could spare were thrown into defensive positions on the perimeter, and as the sun rose low in the east the battle began in earnest. They expected a force a quarter of our size, and our immediate counter-offensive hamstrung them only a few kilometers deep into our territory. Once met in earnest, the fighting was beyond brutal. Even with our knowledge of the enemy and the terrain they outgunned us in almost every skirmish, and many were lost before our soldiers could even reach engagement distance. But that gap was closed, and then the false world of the Nazi crumbled to dust in their minds as they were fought, broken, and routed one by one. This is an indescribable victory. The goliath of the Reich spans a continent, and yet it was defeated here. The army of the Germans slaughters all in its path, and yet it was slain by Russians. The weight of the Swastika crushes all beneath it, and yet, somehow, we still stand.

Haggard survivors and shaken men report of the barbarity with which their units were destroyed, emblematic of the Nazi mindset towards all Russians. Already, generals and brave patriots demand that we mobilize and take the fight to the Germans before they've taken all that we have. They are driving fast into Onega, but are potentially overstretched; if we could puncture their lines so they could be cut off and pulled apart. As they outgun us several times over, however, others argue to make ready our defense for when they inevitably come to us. We always knew this could happen, and what remains of our defensive depth was planned with this in mind; if we ready ourselves we could use the precious time to shore up the gaps in our defense and bleed the momentum from the monsters when they come.\n\n No matter the course of action, this cannot be allowed to continue unresisted.

The general staff is now in agreement. The Nazi war machine has arrived at our doorstep, and it hungrily eyes our possessions.\n\nOur generals argue that, without a doubt, the Germans aim to sever our control of our Northern territories and our White Sea ports. However, our options are painfully limited. Many among our military's finest minds argue that we must prepare to defend against a swift and brutal German onslaught, and that our best odds are to fortify to the greatest of our ability given our limited time so that the Germans are not permitted to cross the Onega river under any circumstances.\n\nOne other proposal remains, however. To prepare a hasty attack upon the flank of the amassing German forces.

For this reason - he notes - it might be advantageous to impose our authority completely on the remnants of the French Republic. With their armies almost nonexistent, and their governments weak, it would be a matter of hours to replace them with a German administration fully committed to the war effort.\n\nAnother general replies that Brittany is an important trade port, and removing its government, no matter how corrupt it is, would hit the German economy hard: while occupying France might be a good idea, Brittany is best left formally independent. Finally, a third suggests not to execute such a plan, and instead sign more favorable agreements with the two governments: fully occupying any of the two countries would only infuriate potential partisans, and force us to detach several garrisons, distracting our troops from the Iberian front.\n\nAs the High Command can't find an agreement, the decision falls to the Führer.

On the other, we can equally spread the development efforts between all administrative units: this would be more costly and less efficient, but no one would complain about lack of funds.

As things are, we are forced to defeat their rebellion before we can claim total victory in iberia.\n\nWe can choose, however, how to deal with them after we have defeated their army. On one hand, we can limit ourselves to crush their puny attempt at independence without further retaliations on the population: this would be respectful of their Aryan birthright, but it might be seen as too lenient.

However, the efforts of the garrisons were for nothing, as a large revolt happened in Bilbao a few days ago.\n\nElements of the Basque militias who had been hiding in the mountains descended on the city and slaughtered the garrison before they could evacuate. Of course, the answer was immediate, and the uprising crushed in blood, but this doesn't change the horrors that happened there. Our soldiers were forced to advance house by house, razing the city to the ground and killing almost everyone they met, as there was no way to differentiate between civilians and military: men and women, old and young, fought to the death amidst the ruins of their city.\n\nEven though order has been restored, morale in the army has fallen very low, as they can't understand why would fellow Aryans fight so fiercely against their liberators."

A tremendous detonation enveloped the vehicle leading the motorcade, the force of the blast throwing it against a building more than twenty meters from the road, and it was only by pure chance that Feldmarschall Schörner survived: his car had passed in second position after its engine had a small problem, and despite being involved in the explosion, it was spared the brunt of the detonation, the general himself only suffering flesh wounds from glass shards as the window broke from the shockwave.\n\nPreliminary investigations report that a partisan cell dug a tunnel under the road from a small apartment they had rented weeks before the parade. The landlord, interrogated by the Abwehr, showed them documents provided by the partisans: they had presented themselves as "art students" and justified the amount of rubble coming from their basement as part of a sculpture they were working on.

The rest were captured en-route, which may explain the heightened security.\n\nOur agents' morale has taken a serious hit. If our men can't even infiltrate and sabotage low priority targets, how can we hope to do anything more ambitious in Burgandy's backyard?"

Maybe it was sloppy communications, perhaps the garrisons were more on guard with the previous sabotage attempts; whatever the reason, most of our men are either dead or captured. Our safehouses were then quickly located and destroyed. Very few of our agents made it out of the country alive, and those that did are not exactly rushing to be deployed there again. That isn't accounting for the fact that Himmler's fanatics are likely tightening their security as we speak. To make matters worse, the Burgandians surely know that it was us who carried out the attempt; tensions are doubtlessly going to rise."

The Abwehr is drafting up plans to sabotage army barracks, slave camps, some of the more important factories, and even SS officer quarters! Their planning may look like it borders on recklessness, but if successful, this would be a wave of sabotage that would be guaranteed to cripple the Burgandian war effort."

All it took for the plan to fall apart was one agent getting caught trying to infiltrate a camp disguised as a slave. What gave him away? He looked 'too healthy.' The agent gave up his fellows after hours of brutal torture; the vast majority of his comrads were likewise captured or killed, with very few of their objects being successfully damaged.\n\nThis failure has not only cost us lives, but also given away our intentions. Himmler now knows that it was the Reich who has been meddling in his petty kingdom, and he will likely act accordingly. Tensions between us have risen to unforeseen levels as a result."

Himmler has to know that some major power is responsible, but our involvement in sowing disarray is still unknown.\n\n The Burgadian military is crippled after this latest wave of attacks. Many of their officers have been taken out of commission, their major factories are more or less shut down, and we have sown enough dissent in the slave camps to at least slow down their output significantly. Our men have certainly gone above and beyond the call of duty!"

However, the Abwehr is confident that they can get the job done; with the SS in chaos at home, they argue that there is no better time than now than to launch an undercover operation to steal codebooks.\n\n They may very well be right; there may not be another window of opportunity like this. Still, is it worth the risks?"

The issue is that...\n\n They never came out.\n\n About a day after our men were last seen, nearly all of our safehouses in Burgundy were raided; most of our agents were compromised in the  crackdown. It's safe to say that the operation went horribly wrong; our men probably got captured, and then likely were horribly tortured to death, but not before they gave up sensitive information, if the raids are anything to go by.\n\n We knew the risks, and now we have to deal with the consequences. The SS likely know that it was without a doubt us who have been sabotaging their backlines. Tensions are without a doubt going to rise; it remains to be seen if they will boil over or not."

It seems the men got caught up in a briefing, and had no choice but to blend in. It's a miracle they didn't get caught!\n\n Already, we are learning valuable Burgaidan secrets.

The Abwehr has been working on cracking these hidden cells, and believe they may have a lead! If they  manage to find something solid and trace the bread crumb trail, we may be able to expose most of Himmler's informants!\n\n Of course, failure is a possibility. If the spy network discovers that we're on to them, they may go deeper underground, or even act against the agents attempting to smoke them out.

Perhaps their spy network is more elaborate than we thought, or our men simply made too much noise. Whatever happened, their agents have gone dark.\n\n It isn't just the SS men who have gone missing. Several of the men working leads on this operation have mysteriously gone missing; we only have one report of one of our men being kidnapped out of his house at night in Essen; we imagine the other dozen men have met similar fates and are likely dead already. To make matters worse, Himmler himself will have gotten word that we are focusing efforts on curbing SS influence, which will more than likely raise tensions between us."

From there, it was relatively easy to crack down on the rest of the spy ring. Although we know for a fact that SS agents and sympathisers slipped through our net, more than a hundred informats have been arrested!

Müller could feel the venom in his leader's voice even from over the phone, but for once, it didn't scare him senseless.\n\n "Oh, um...." Müller stuttered. He actually didn't have anything to report; his sector was all quiet; he was just calling to confirm the unthinkable for himself. But instead of hearing nothing, like he was told he'd hear from his peers, Heinrich Himmler himself was on the phone. The tone was unmistakable.\n\n "Uh... yes. I'm sending half of my corps to reinforce the northern border as we speak, sir!" A lie. For a spur of the moment one though, not bad. He could give the orders when he got off the phone. A moment of silence passed. How the Hell did he manage to make a few seconds of quiet feel like an hour.\n\n "Your... initiative is commendable during these times, Müller. I'm glad to hear that. I have other matters to attend to, but expect further orders within very soon." The phone went dead, Himmler had hung up on him. Müller took a breath and allowed himself a sigh of relief before he wiped his tears off his face. He looked down at his phone, then punched in his adjutant's number."

The people of Burgundy had surely had enough of Himmler?\n\n"Nothing, sir." The Abwehr officer stared dead ahead, not making eye contact with his Führer. "Every part of the operation was carried out as planned. Satellite and radio monitoring showed no change. One of our informants noticed the literature shellings. Apart from one unfortunate victim of the first impact, the books just... stayed there.

High ranking admirals are insisting that we need to either downsize our fleet or find new ports to dock our ships in.\n Neither option is at all enticing, as we are forced to either greatly reduce the Reich's power projection (essentially a non-option) or invade other countries to use their ports. Voices from the Kriegsmarine are "requesting" (which, if we ignore, may lead to things getting ugly) that we take over Britain and Norway in order to make use of their facilities.\nIt seems that there is actually no choice at all; launch those invasions or face the ever-growing power and wrath of the militarists."

Upon receiving news of the hasty promotion of several new guard officials, many members within the old guard took out actions as a personal attack to their standing within our ranks. \n\nWhat's more, our attempts at undermining the old guards authority have failed drastically. Attempts to implicate the old guard in committing various war crimes against non-aryan populations have failed. Aware that their positions were at stake, several old guard generals have successfully convinced members of the new guard instead to commit such war crimes in the name of the Führer. \n\n"

In doing so, we would establish a strong influence within the navy and prevent figures such as Speidel from gaining any more followers. However, the sheer number of new guard generals within the navy poses a problem, as it will be quite difficult to bring all of them to our side. \n\nFocusing on securing a majority of the generals would provide us with a large array of support within the navy, preventing a widespread mutiny. While this method would in theory be the most effective, it would be difficult to carry this out in actuality. On the other hand, focusing on a few key generals could prove to be more beneficial. By focusing on generals with more power and influence within the new guard,  we could perhaps gain control over the entire new guard via the influence of a few trustworthy individuals.\n\n"

Many had suspected the Führer would move on Schörner's clique eventually, however none could have anticipated the swift nature of his departure. With the growing support of Schörner and his clique acting in direct opposition to the Führer's supreme authority, many wonder what political turbulence lies in store In Germany's future.  \n\nWhile no one knows for certain what Schörner's next move will be, the political absence felt by his departure will need to be remedied immediately.

The loyalty and high regard that the military old guard held for him was unmatched, and the sacking of the old Field Marshall has perhaps only compounded their respect and loyalty for him.\n\nFollowing our failure to find a suitable replacement for the old general in the wake of his sacking, Schörner has wasted not one moment in rallying his base of support around him. Within days, secretive contingency plans were hurriedly dusted off by disloyal militarists. Telephone lines were choked full with frantic and urgent phone calls between military officers around the Reich, enacting all sorts of plans and declaring a plethora of emergency codes.\n\nErratic and unordered military movements have been reported from Elsass to the farthest reaches of our Eastern frontiers. Several prominent members of the military high command have hurriedly fled Germania, as the Oberkommandos report that communication with countless Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, and Heer contingents appears to have been severed.

His veterancy as an officer in the campaigns against the French, Polish, and Russians decades ago should prove popular among the men of the armed forces, and his undeniable charm should surely win over many dissident militarists within the ranks.\n\nWhilst his charm and ground experience is undeniable, it remains to be seen how the militarists will receive the appointment of the young Reichskommissar to the nation's highest military post. The Field Marshal is swamped with allegations of corruption which he has so far been able to charismatically talk himself out of, and the snubbing of more senior members of the old guard will surely agitate many.

It was to the Führer's understanding that Müller had understood the situation, and was willing to encumber the task set before him. Why the hell would he suddenly resign, fleeing the nation entirely? None of this made sense to him.\n\nYet, the pieces began to come together. Seemingly within moments of Müller's resignation and flight, Feldmarschall Speidel began to pick up the pieces that were hurriedly left behind, almost as if he expected this series of events to occur. Speidel has now reached out to the Führer about taking up the mantle of OKW chief to swiftly seal the vacuum that has suddenly appeared once again, and has already begun issuing directives amongst several military elements as if he were already in-charge.\n\nWith a fast deteriorating situation, it is clear that Speidel has assumed more effective control over the armed forces than any other man has to this point, and the Führer does not see many other options laid out before him."

The post that he had longed for the return of for years.\n\nDespite Speidel's undeniable effectiveness in wrangling the several ideological wings of the military, relations have always been chilly between the veteran Feldmarschall and the Führer. Ever since Speidel delayed what Göring sees as his rightful ascension into Germania in 1963, the Führer has severely distrusted the veteran Field Marshal. Yet, as the crisis began to unfold throughout the reich as the military sat without a central commander, Göring knew that he must set aside the distrust he held in order to preserve his own increasingly fragile reign.\n\nSpeidel's re-ascension to commandership over the Wehrmacht comes at an ever increasingly trying time for the Reich, reminiscent of the opening days of the Bürgerkrieg years ago.

Could the Führer really have been so bold as to appoint his family into the highest post achievable by a member of the German military?\n\nThe eyes of the nation did not deceive them. Heinrich Theodore Göring has been appointed by the Führer as the head of the Wehrmacht in this time of crisis. A former second world war luftwaffe pilot turned career officer, he has had a long career in the armed forces, but not as fruitful a career as many other candidates that stood in line for the military's top job. Surely, Heinrich Göring was appointed by the Führer to act as a loyal puppet in control of the Wehrmacht, something that he has lacked from the start of his reign.

 goering.2018.desc:0 "To say that the sacking of Feldmarschall Schörner was controversial would be a gigantic understatement. Even with Führer Göring's efforts to decrease Schörner's massive influence in the Heer, parts of the army protested furiously against what they saw as the final straw in a long list of the Führer's aggression against the army. For being a militarist, as he so claimed, Göring was taking quite the turn towards Bolshevism- at least, that's what the protestors claimed.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Speidelites applauded Schörner's removal. However, this approval has quickly turned into fear of their own. Whispers of Schörner attempting another coup rippled through Speidel's supporters, and soon they became as paranoid as the Schörnerites. If Schörner truly was trying a second coup, would Göring stop him? What would happen to Speidel? What would happen to them?\n\nFrom this moment on, perhaps the consequences of such an earthshaking push was inevitable. Divisions reported to headquarters more and more infrequently, strange new "exercises'' were scheduled and rescheduled- most importantly, Herr Schörner headed east to give a "speaking tour", and Feldmarschall Speidel headed north for "administrative duties." All of these actions were viewed with suspicion, but nothing could be done about them- nothing would rock the boat harder than arresting Schörner and Speidel.\n\nAs it turns out, one doesn't need to rock the boat when it's already sinking.\n\nAs of now, Schörner and thousands of soldiers march on Germania, determined to right the wrongs that Göring has pushed onto them. Their intentions, while not outright stated, are beyond clear. To the north, Speidel marches south on Germania, presumably in a coup attempt of his own, or perhaps solely to stop Schörner from completing his own. Germania itself is in a state of chaos, as thousands flee into the countryside from the impending battle. The Führer's only hope now is that his new Feldmarschall remains loyal to his side. . . "

But the Fuhrer, eventually, decided to help those poor soldiers despite of the opposition. However, now it seems that the assistance he has sent is just in vain. \n\nFor weeks, we've been receiving the reports form Italy, and most of them, if not all, were not good. They kept telling us how strong their enemies' firepower was and how dire their situations were. Moreover, at the end of every report, they all asked for more help, which is the last thing we can give for now. And then, in the last week, they just stopped to send any report. Finally, yesterday we learned from the CLN's official announcement, that the Italian garrison was totally "annihilated and no longer existed in the Apennine Peninsula". In one word, the Führer lost his bet. \n\nWhile until yesterday we kept the real situation about Italian garrison secret from the public, the announcement made by the CLN still spread like wildfire in the land possessed by all three factions of the German Civil War. Our enemies quickly seized this chance to attack us through their propaganda, saying that we are responsible for the loss of the garrison.

One camp was reportedly so overfull following the surrender of an enemy division, that the conditions described within the camp beckon to the treatment of captured Soviets in the 1940s. The prisoners in these camps were described as being made to do industrial labour, being forced to meet quotas. Most in the camps wear the tattered uniforms of Heer conscripts.

Some prisoners, oddly, suspiciously brandish no uniforms at all, and drag about in seemingly civilian clothing.\n\nYet, most concerning to us, is that one battalion of ours that was passing by one of Görings camps was recognized by the prisoners inside the camp, who began frantically calling out the names of the soldiers in our passing battalion. For those prisoners were of the same battalion, captured weeks ago by Schörners forces. Demanding to know the meaning of the imprisonment of his soldiers, the battalion commander and his men forced their way into the camp, liberating all those who belonged to their forces. It appeared that those men were placed into a prisoner of war camp when captured by Schörners forces, only to be liberated by Görings armies days later. But rather than liberation, they were hushed and placed into another camp.

 goering.2063.desc:0 "The usual proceedings of the day were proceeding uninhibited for the Führer; war briefings, directive signing, further war briefings, perhaps with some war planning sessions mixed in to it all. That was, until a furious Hans Speidel was on the telephone.\n\nThe hot headed Field Marshal wasted no time with pleasantries, and paid no respects to the Führer. He was clearly not interested in such. He had an ultimatum to give.\n\nApparently, a battalion underneath his command managed to force their way into one of our prisoner of war camps. Within, they claim to have found several of their men among the prisoners, and proceeded to break those men out of our camp. Dumbfounded after being confronted by a friendly force, our guards did little to prevent the chaos.\n\nThe fact does remain, however, that prisoners are not vetted to determine who they fight for. All prisoners of war encountered are simply determined to be hostile, and are rounded along into the labour programmes. Such programmes are essential to the war effort, and it may not be advisable to set a precedent of granting freedom to any prisoner that some unruly commander decides to bring into his ranks. Furthermore, allowing factionalists to make demands of the Führer would be an unacceptable degradation of the Führerprinzip. However, Speidel is a valuable ally. A collection of cool headed generals suggest that we allow the release of these prisoners back to Speidel's custody as a gesture of goodwill and the continued alliance between our forces."

Furthermore, the old Reichsmarschall went on to directly scold Speidel for what he perceived to be insolence, and demanded that we "fall back in line", as if we are merely soldiers to be ordered about.\n\nThis time, Göring has gone too far. Not only has he refused our reasonable demands that allied soldiery be freed from his labour camps, yet he has also demanded that we subdue ourselves beneath him.\n\nIt has become apparent that the Führer sees Generalfeldmarschall Speidel as little more than pawns upon his chessboard. Speidel finds himself now torn. Should he prove to the overweight Reichsmarschall that he is no mere pawn, and strike now whilst the iron is hot? Or shall he swallow his pride and ambition, and fall in line under the Führer, perhaps this time for good?"

Göring, that fat puppet draped in capes and garnet rings like a Weimar whore, sought to feebly seize control of his own strings. Such cowards had been writhing on every step of the stairway to glory, clawing and grasping at Schörner and his men like children. At long last, the sweetness of true victory can be tasted in the air like smoke on a battlefield.\n\n The continent has been carved up to serve the Reich: From the north of Scandinavia to the north of Africa, from the west of Europe to the west of Russia, a beautiful new future has been secured for the younger generations.

In the streets, broadcast is announcing that the old regime is no more, replaced by the Reichskommissariat Brittanien established by the Reich directly. \n\n Though most people have been familiar with changes of regime in recent decades, the atmosphere in the city is still odd since it is the first time in a thousand years that England is ruled, both in name and in fact, by a power foreign from their homeland. In some remote bars, people gather to drink for everything in their memories, and sing God Save the King together, for the last time in their lives. From now on, the history of England will walk into a new chapter.\n\nWhile the whole of England remains silent in melancholy, the Downing Street, now the headquarter of German occupation forces is now overwhelmed by cheers and laughs of victory.

From the Scottish Highlands to Cardiff, the country used to be known as the United Kingdom is finally united again, but under the rule of the Reich this time. \n\n New conquests, of course, lead to new problem for us to deal with. No one in this world would be willing to give their hard-won liberty away so easily, and local guerilla and anti-guerilla activities has immediately begun when we stepped on their lands. If we wish to have a peaceful Britain behind us as well as utilize local manpower and natural resources, we must think carefully about how to set up our own administrations. \n\n In the music played by Scottish bagpipes, the Führer finally makes his decision.

The Iberian Federal Government, the Basque, the Catalons, the Portuguese, all of these and more fell beneath the advancing boots of the Wehrmacht and the falling bombs of the Luftwaffe. With every contender eliminated Goering has ordered the region once under the domain of the Iberian Union to be balkanized into some half a dozen Reichskommisariats, most of whom are led by members of Hans Speidel's faction or members of the "New Guard" of the military high command.

 goering_successor.1.desc:0 "The Reichsmarschall swaggered to the front of the crowd with confidence, his trademark grin stretching from ear to ear. Today he was adorned in his blue Luftwaffe uniform, its medals clanking as he took his position behind the podium. Behind him stood his most loyal advisors: the bespectacled Ferdinand Schörner, the sneering Otto Ernst Remer, the smartly suited Wilhelm Stuckart.\n\n"Members of the Reichstag," Göring spoke after a few moments of silence, gripping the podium tightly with his jewelled fingers. "I have humbly accepted the Führer's offer to become his official successor. Many of you will know that such a proposition has been enshrined in our law since 1938. I am proud to say that the strength of our relationship has only grown in this time." His eyes, blue and narrow, dragged themselves across the brown masses of the Reichstag. "The Reich, however, has only weakened! As your Führer, I promise to drag us from the marshy swamp of our own making and into a glorious new era!" His voice grew slightly strained as he continued the speech. "I shall deliver us into an age of absolute military domination over our foes. Make no mistake. The Führer's vision for Europe must be completed!"\n\nA sporadic wave of applause swept through the crowd, emanating largely from the militarists and Wehrmacht officers, but also from a few conservatives. Göring gave an uneasy smile and glanced behind him, where Schörner was watching on eagerly.\n\n"To strengthen our beautiful Vaterland," Göring continued, "we must save our economy from the clutches of those who wish to exploit it for their own selfish purposes. You know who I'm talking about!" Göring's voice grew more energetic, and he puffed out his chest in excitement. "I'm talking about the parasitic German bankers! I'm talking about the Swiss! Let us revitalize our economy, let us re-energize the German workforce, let us abolish wasteful spending on useless projects that plague the Reich!""

 goering_successor.2.t:0 "One Bad Photo..."
 goering_successor.2.desc:0 ""Let's try one with a far-off look," Göring instructed the young photographer. He looked dramatically to the side, brow furrowed in stern thought. The camera clicked multiple times. He was wearing his personalized dove-gray uniform, complete with medals. He turned back to the photographer. "Bernhard, was it? Ah, Bertold. My apologies. Show me yesterday's photograph. The one with the blue Luftwaffe uniform." Bertold brought the printed photo over. "Hmm... I want that one destroyed. This is going in the newspapers, remember. I must look my best."\n\nSchörner arrived in the doorway with a small document tucked under his arm. Göring beckoned him over and examined the papers. The Feldmarschall had drafted a plan to violently suppress the student protests that had broken out since his appointment as successor. Bertold was prowling around the room, experimenting with different angles and muttering to himself. The young photographer had probably been a student himself, not so long ago. Göring gave a heavy sigh. He handed the document back and nodded his approval. Oh well. The students had been growing more and more unruly. It was time they were taught a lesson.\n\n"Reichsmarschall Göring," the photographer whispered in a shaking voice, drawing Göring from his thoughts. "I took a photograph of your plan. The one ordering Heer troops to use brutal force against the peaceful student protests. I will leak this photo unless you cancel this order immediately. Is that understood?"\n\nGöring stared at the young man in shock, but said nothing. He simply rose to his feet, thanked him for his time, and walked over to the waiting Schörner. The officer noticed his glum expression, and looked over at Bertold with suspicion."

Göring looked up from his hearty meal with a chuckle, shaking the contents of the envelope onto the table. Wilhelm Stuckart lowered his fork and frowned in confusion.\n\n"No need to worry yourself, Wilhelm," Göring grinned as he inspected the photo. The image was of Göring sitting down on a chair and inspecting a document. One of the papers was hanging loosely in full view of the camera, detailing much of Schörner's plans against the student protests. "We'll get back to matters of policy in a second."\n\n"I regret to inform you that our good friend Bertold took a nasty fall from his apartment window," Schörner shook his head in mock grief. "He was quite high up, I'm afraid."\n\n"He must have been taking photos of the sky!" Göring roared with laughter, slamming the table in his hand. He wiped a tear from his eye and turned to Stuckart. "You haven't got a lighter, have you?" He plucked the lighter from his advisor's palm and lit it underneath the image with glee. The bright yellow flames licked across the photograph, contorting the image as it folded and blackened. Göring watched on with satisfaction, the flames reflected in his pale blue eyes."

His cloak was blowing magnificently behind him, thanks to the chilly gusts of wind from the open window.\n\n"I'll give you calm!" Göring yelled, breaking his pose and kicking the stool over. Naturally, Göring had hired a new photographer. Someone more professional. Someone older. Someone less likely to support Speer. That didn't stop him from getting on his nerves.\n\nSchörner arrived at the doorway. Göring strode over him with a thunderous expression and swung his baton, hitting the Feldmarschall in the side of the arm. The officer looked more shocked than hurt.\n\n"You useless fucking idiot! I told you to exterminate that little rat Bertold! Why the fuck is he still alive to leak photos of our plan? The protests have tripled in size!" Göring was about to throw his baton to the floor in fury but stopped himself at the last moment. It was too precious to risk breaking. "That agent you sent to deal with Bertold? The one who got fucking caught?  I want him liquidated immediately."\n\n"Is that necessary, Hermann?" Schörner responded with gritted teeth, rubbing his sore arm. Any other day, he would have exploded with fury. "Does it matter what the students think? They weren't going to support you anyway."\n\n"Have. Him. Liquidated. I won't ask again. And don't you dare call me Hermann!" He felt a wave of smugness as Schörner nodded in compliance. It wasn't often he had such power over the officer.

Masses of students bustled before him, waving placards and bricks alike, screaming at the armed soldiers like banshees. A large papier-mâché head was floating above the crowd with thin evil eyes and a feline grin, mockingly painted in makeup. There were several chants, disparate and sporadic, but the loudest without question was: "Down with Göring!"\n\nClaus gripped his rifle tightly and looked towards his comrades for assurance. He was 18 years old and fresh out of training. He had imagined being sent to the beautiful expanses of the snowy eastern front, or down in the exotic jungles of Afrika. He did not expect to be facing down fellow Germans for his first assignment.\n\nSoldiers were pushing forwards, screaming at the protestors to disperse. The closest cluster backed away instantly, apart from one girl who thrust her anti-Göring sign forwards and screamed back. One of the soldiers walked up and smashed her in the face with the butt of his rifle.\n\n"Disperse!" Claus yelled. His voice cracked. He raised his rifle at the students, who dropped their signs and darted. He saw a group of soldiers tackling a pair of brick-throwers to the ground and smashing them to a bloody pulp with their boots. Another comrade fired a shot into the papier-mâché head, which exploded as the crowd nearby broke apart with a cry. Claus did not let the fear overtake him. He was a soldier of the Reich. Sure, these were fellow Germans... students, around his age... but they were protesting against the next Führer, against the Reich. Anyone who protests against the Reich protests against the German people. One of the demonstrators lobbed a brick towards him, missing the young soldier by a few inches. Claus brought his rifle up and fired into the student's legs, forcing him to the ground. "I SAID, DISPERSE!""

To enrapture the German people, he thought to himself with a smile, one must appeal to their base instincts: War, military, and grandeur. He had ordered a display of power on a grand scale not seen since the glorious celebrations following the triumph of the Second Welktkrieg. It had been expensive, of course, but his revitalization of the economy following the Führer's inevitable demise would more than make up for it.\n\nA sense of pride surged through him as the German Göring Division marched onwards to lead the procession. The splendor of those uniforms, the synchronization of their steps, and sheer beauty of those mechanicals creatures rolling forward... it was almost too much to handle. He was enraptured by his own propaganda! Göring chuckled softly. Perhaps he would build a statue of himself in Germania? One for Hitler too, of course, but maybe ever so slightly smaller than his...\n\n"Stop prattling, Feldmarschall!" Göring laughed as he turned towards Ferdinand Schörner, who was conferring intensely with Otto Ernst Remer and Johann von Kielmansegg. "You're missing the parade!""

We'll use the failed 50s coup as our explanation." Göring could feel a surge of energy spiking through him as he reeled off his list of foes. He hadn't felt this alive since 1934. "I still haven't decided on Heinrich Müller. He's a Bormannite, yes, but many of them will flock to my cause when I'm declared Führer."\n\n"He stays on the list. He's too much of a risk." Schörner was strumming his fingers against the table. "As for Speer's supporters, we should start with his merry band of Bolsheviks. Kiesinger, Schmidt, that loathsome Erhard, Treskow... they should all be hanged as traitors."\n\n"Not Treskow," Göring corrected. "He is a military man. He must be shot." The Night of the Long Knives had not been this complicated. Purging the SA leadership, a few conservatives, Party rivals - nothing compared to the political quagmire Göring had to navigate.\n\n"There are many rising officers that must be taken care of as well," Schörner continued. "Shot, if you insist."\n\n"Show me the list." Göring ran his eyes over the names with a frown. "Are these men even political?"\n\n"Perhaps not, but I certainly am," Schörner said with an unblinking stare. "If I weren't, you would not be in such a high standing with the Militarists."\n\n"If you think these deaths are necessary, then so be it," Göring muttered, understanding the threat.

"This extract shows the Führer praising Goebbels, not me."\n\n"My apologies, Reichsmarschall," Herr Fischer said hastily. "My men have been scouring for weeks -"\n\n"Apologies are not necessary!" Göring laughed. "Just replace 'Joseph Goebbels' with 'Hermann Göring'. He's not going to complain from the grave, is he?" He picked up a transcript dated from September 1st 1939. It was one of Hitler's many speeches to the Reichstag. "Ahem. 'Should something happen to me in this battle, my first successor will be party member Göring'. Make sure this one is released first."\n\nNewspaper and speech extracts. Quotes by esteemed Party members. Newsreel footage of Hitler and Göring shaking hands, or standing side by side on the Reichstag balcony, or deliberating over war plans. Audio recordings of Hitler praising Göring. The successor had ordered his men to comb through all of it, compiling everything for detailed inspection. Once they had received his blessing, they would all be sent to the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment and spread to the German people. The public had to be certain of the future Führer's legitimacy, and so he was presenting himself as the natural progression of leadership. For the average German, continuity means safety."

The Hauptmann, in all his boundless luck, had been instructed to uncover the ones buried underground.\n\nAs the Reich's political stage began to crumble alongside Hitler's health, Göring and Schörner had soon realized the inevitability of the impending civil war. A swift operation was initiated, in which weapons and other supplies were secretly diverted to hidden depots throughout the Reich. Now that the bloodshed had begun, it was time to unleash the concealed weaponry.\n\nThere was a loud clunk of a shovel hitting metal. One of the soldiers looked up at the officer with a grin.

"Do you have anything to report?"\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Schörner responded smugly. He joined Remer and von Kielmansegg at the map. "Many of the Waffen-SS troops we bribed have followed through on their promises. They have arrived at our territory, and are ready to fight, as per your commands."\n\n"Excellent!" Göring slapped the table in excitement. "Heydrich will be furious! I want you to officially add this new unit into our army. Their skill set will be useful for very specific operations."\n\n"I shall begin planning immediately, my Führer," Schörner responded curtly, giving another salute and marching towards the door.\n\n"One more thing, Feldmarschal!"

The grandiloquence of Germania was beginning to blur, the glorious white marble of the Volkshalle and black night sky running together like the colors of a painting. The phone was ringing. People were shouting. The distant gunshots were getting closer. Göring swirled his champagne glass with an empty smile and downed it in one gulp. What better time to celebrate than the end of the world?\n\nThe first phone call had been from an intelligence officer. Reichsmarschall Schörner and his loyal clique were sending men to seize government buildings throughout Germania, assassinating threats and cutting communication lines. The second phone call had been from a panicking Wilhelm Stuckart, who ranted for a few seconds before being dragged away with a cry.\n\nThe phone stopped ringing. He could hear men shouting outside the door. Visions flashed past him. Flying over France in the Great War. Meeting Carin for the first time. Delivering a speech before an adoring crowd. Marrying Emmy. Edda's birth. Planning the conquest of Europe. What was to become of Emmy? What was to become of Edda?\n\nLet the history books recall him as the Fϋhrer who went down fighting. The doors burst open, and a squadron of officers marched inside. Göring pulled out his Luger and fired aimlessly. The men fired back. Pain exploded across his belly, pushing his back against the desk and forcing him onto the floor with a gasp. Blood was pouring onto his hands, turning his gold wedding ring crimson, staining his beautiful uniform like red wine. Schörner stood above him, pointing a pistol directly at his head with a snarl.

It was hard to compare the sheer amount of people to those days though; attendance was off the charts, to Remer's pleasure. He stood in front of the podium, relishing the cheers from over a hundred-thousand of his fellow countrymen that stood in front of him, overfilling the plaza.\n\n "My fellow Germans! My brothers! My countrymen!" Remer began. The crowd roared back in assent; their approval shaking the ground itself. Remer stood, a large grin on his face. This, he thought, must be how Hitler felt. He scanned the massive crowd, looked upon the massive Swastika banners hanging from the buildings, then at the old man sitting to his right, with the Reich's highest ranking officers sitting around him. Göring, for his part, did look regal. His uniform neatly pressed as always, with his badges glinting in the afternoon sun. His expressiveness, however, was stoic. No emotions were expressed on his stony face. Remer knew he didn't want to be there, but what could he do? What kind of Führer would miss this occasion? The crowd's noise begin to die down.\n\n "Today is a momentous day..." Remer continued. "For the Reich is about to claim what is rightfully ours! Finally, after so much time, we will finally lay low the rest of the traitors that oppose us in the old world!" The crowd again roared their approval. Remer nodded his head in agreement.\n\n "For too long; MUCH too long, the Japanese cowards have exploited the peoples of Asia. For decades, they work the blood of nationalist while spiting us, US! Even though, without us, there would be no Japanese Empire! The cowards have sat in their corner of the world for long enough. It is time to bring low the last of our so called friends, those that thought they could get away with using the Reich and her peoples as a means to an end!"\n\n The crowd went mad, and the din of so many in such a small area was deafening.

No words really needed to be spoken as Göring read the bill that Schörner had wordlessly dropped on his desk for the Führer's rubber stamp of approval. It was no wonder that Schörner looked dejected.\n\n The leader of the militrist faction, that clique that now dominated the government, had lost control over rabid war-mongers.

No wonder Schörner looked defeated; even he had lost control over the militarists. It seemed as though war with the other superpowers of the world was now inevitable.

The only aspect in common was their penchant for dark sunglasses. At an unspoken signal, the representatives broke from their packs and approached one another. \n\n Reichsminister Artur Axmann responded to the "Assalaam 'alaikum" with a jumbled and stilted "Wa 'alaikum assalaam". With foreign pleasantries out of the way, he more confidently extended his hand and switched to German. "It is a pleasure to finally reach your great kingdom.

We trust your landing was not too rough - the King Abdulaziz International Airport is still under construction, but by its completion it will be the greatest airport in all Arabia." \n\n Axmann cast his gaze around. Indeed, it seemed as though the hand of god had lifted construction equipment from Germania itself and dropped it into the middle of the desert. The scale of construction was vast, sprawling into the edges of Jeddah itself. The town was expanding at the rate of knots - even from the air, one could see the pace of it's growth, spilling over its boundaries like a flood. Yes, the House of Saud could prove a valuable ally, if they could be appropriately wooed.

Once Axmann's appetite had been sated, the Saudi delegation had begun to bring their terms to the table. "Herr Axmann," their leader, one Muhammad Abdullah ibn Saud said in a thick accent. "King Faisal has been most impressed by the Reich's success in its recent campaigns. The Saudi Kingdom's arms industry, while most effective, is small.

Some comment Axmann made caught Muhammad Abdullah's attention though, and he interjected. "Indeed, Germany's assertion of it's sphere of influence has been deeply impressive - however, the question of our own Kingdom's role in the area must be raised. While Persia is indeed a naturally Aryan domain, there exist states in the Persian Gulf, formerly under Italian dominion, that have long yearned for independence.

Axmann was discussing the great scale of construction in Germania at length, though strategically failing to mention it's advanced decrepitude in the less desirable areas. Muhammad Abdullah laughed politely, and brought his own anecdote to the table, smoothly flowing into a request. \n\n "I do wish to one day see the great city of Germania, for its riches are told of across the globe. King Faisal too wishes to see Riyadh as a mighty capital for his kingdom, and Germania is seen by all as the model city.

The former Italian client state has realigned itself with the Reich, becoming an equal partner and avoiding the grim fate of its neighbours. With the treaty signed, there was an official exchange of gifts. To the Reich was presented a beautifully ornate scimitar, upon which was inscribed many blessings and prayers towards the Führer's health and wellbeing. To the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was gifted a great portrait of the Führer, signed with the hand of Göring himself. Axmann gave himself an internal pat on the back.

An end to negotiations meant an end to his stay, and an explanation for his failure to reach terms. Of course, there always remained the possibility of badmouthing his hosts - more like than not an invasion had been inevitable, he had always said so. \n\n "I thank you and King Faisal deeply for your hospitality, Mohammed Abdullah. I hope one day we can meet once more under better circumstances." \n\n Mohammed Abdulah ibn-Saud inclined his head and turned to leave, as Axmann began to pack.\n\n What an insufferable man, he thought.

Captain Krull and his 3-man crew read the report reaching their patrol boat on the Amur over and over again. But it refused to change. \n\n "This is really happening isn't it? This is it, it's over." this was Kohlner, the youngest of them. A harsher officer would have reprimanded him for uttering the words. But Krull knew that the boy had been through much at only 16 years. \n\n "Yeah, this was only a matter of time. Skirmishes everywhere, a tension you can almost cut. Really, with the fat man this was only a matter of time" This was Bellner a German-Hungarian, who had only recently been 'volunteered' into the Wehrmacht. "Istvaan..." Krull said warningly, but softly. "I might let you get away with this, but other offi..."\n\n He couldn't finish the sentence as a sudden impact shook the boat. Instantly the men hit the floor. \n\n "Shit! Jap Artillery, we have to get ou...!" \n\n A second hit, a flash, a searing pain and the boat and crew were gone. Not the only casualty that day. The German-Japanese conflict has begun."

 goering.1491.d:0 "The Oberbefehlshaber had fought hard to get this meeting - the Führer had been spending most of his days with the OKW and his precious Luftwaffe. Finally however, he sat in Göring's office, though the man had drunk far too much wine for his preference.\n\nHe chose his words carefully. "Mein Führer, the Ringhorn plan is proceeding well, though there are some complications. To effectively maintain a cordon about Burgundy, a more effective network of bases is required. To rely solely on ports in Germany increases our ships' transit times to unacceptable levels. The ports of the Jade Bight and Denmark, while excellent, are simply too few, and many of our vessels must return to the Baltic to resupply. This creates gaps in our blockade, that -"\n\nGöring leaned forward in his chair, putting down his glass. "Gaps? My God man, this is unacceptable! You must rectify this at once!"\n\nThe Oberbefehlshaber was momentarily taken aback, but recovered quickly. "Indeed mein Führer. I believe that by requisitioning the ports of southern England and Norway, we could half the amount of time ships spend outside the cordon."\n\n"Then do so immediately. Damnation, it's like I have to decide everything here. Whatever it takes to bring down Burgundy, do it!" He excused him with a flick of his hand, and returned to his glass.\n\nNonplussed, he rose and left the room. He wasn't sure whether to be pleased or not."

 goering.1492.t:0 "The Siberian Secession"
 goering.1492.d:0 "Every day, Germany creeps closer to our borders. Once the entirety of Asia separated us from the Reich's Eastern Front, now Mongolian border patrols regularly encounter their Russian counterparts enforcing the boundaries of the All Russian Military League, the Reich's stalking horse in Siberia. The constant conquests of the Reich will inevitably reach the Co-Prosperity Sphere in a matter of months, and Russia will be the front line.\n\nThe Russians however are no more eager to take part in this conquest than we are to attempt to repel it. Whilst the All Russian Military League is nominally a collaborationist state, control over this vast area is weak and true collaborators are few and far between given Germany's reputation. The Reich considers them little more than cannon fodder at best and unworthy of life at worst. Messages have travelled across the steppe, carried by Russian and Mongolian horsemen, that suggest the League would be much happier working with Japan than Germany.\n\nTo steal Russia from under the Reich's nose would no doubt be considered an act of war, but war is all but inevitable. With Russian aid the front line would be much further from our own border, slowing the Reich's relentless advance and hopefully bogging them down in the Russian Hell once more."

It was not to be, however - word has reached us of efforts by the All Russian Military League to contact the Japanese government through their shared border in Mongolia. Naturally they are forbidden from all foreign communication, so this can only be an attempt to curry favour and secede to the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nNo Japanese reply was recorded - evidently the Asiatics are smart enough to see the foolishness of stealing from the Reich. Nonetheless, this treason demands punishment. These Russians really never learn."
