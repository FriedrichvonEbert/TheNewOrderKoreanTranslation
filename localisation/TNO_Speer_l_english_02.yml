 speer.1.t:0 "슈페어가 승리하다"
 speer.1.desc:0 "오늘 라이히슈타크의 계단에서, 슈페어는 자신이 독일 총통으로써의 자리를 마침내 지켜냈음을 선언했습니다. 게르마니아까지 슈페어를 호위한 슈타우펜베르크의 제6 전차사단의 병사들과 수백명의 무장 민병대가 독일국의 새로운 지도자를 둘러쌌고, 슈페어는 자신이 독일에 번영과 계몽으로 가득 찬 새로운 시대를 가져오겠다고 선언했습니다. \n\n 수백 수천 명의 사람들이 새로운 지도자의 등극과 독일이 여지껏 휘말렸던 가장 피비린내 나는 전쟁이 끝난 것을 축하하며 온 도로를 가득 채우는 동안, 여전히 나라 곳곳에서는 소규모 접전이 지속되고 있습니다. 슈페어의 적들은 패배했음에도 불구하고, 항복을 거부하며 슈페어를 차기 지도자로 인정하지 않고 있습니다. 하지만, 슈페어의 연설은 독일에서만 찬사를 받은 것이 아닙니다. 국내에서 엄청난 반응을 얻으며, 수십 년 만에 가장 높은 시청률을 기록한 방송이 되었기 때문입니다. \n\n "강한 독일이라는 꿈을 꾸는 것으로는 충분치 않습니다. 우리는 강한 독일을 믿어야 합니다. 우리는 강한 독일을 얻고자 분투해야 합니다. 우리는 어둠 속에서 불을 밝혀, 우리의 자손들을 위한 불빛이 되어, 우리를 그들에게 강하고, 용감하고, 아름다운 새로운 세상을 물려주었던 자들로 기억하게 할 것입니다.""

 # Anti-Heydrich Pact
 speer.16.t:0 "반 하이드리히 협약"
 speer.16.d:0 "4명의 남자가 독일의 미래를 걸고 전투를 벌였지만, 대부분은 3명만이 진정한 경쟁자라 생각했습니다. 보어만, 괴링, 슈페어 말이죠. 그중 네 번째인 하이드리히는 약간의 군만 지원하고 대중들의 지원을 전혀 받지 못했으며, 영토가 단절되어 있었기에 곧 운이 다하여 파멸할 것이라 생각되었습니다. 대부분은 그의 성공을 처음부터 생각하지 않았습니다. 분명 누군가가 빠르게 그를 쳐부수어 그 악몽이 끝날 것이라 생각했죠. \n\n 불행히도, 상황은 우리가 예상했던 대로 굴러가지 않았습니다. 하이드리히는 빠르게 속도와 기세를 얻었으며, 대부분의 사람들은 그에 대한 저항이 상당함에도 불구하고 하이드리히야말로 독일을 무너뜨릴 진정한 위협이라 생각합니다. 우리가 다른 경쟁자들을 혐오하는 것만큼이나, 우리 모두는 동의할 수 있습니다. 하이드리히는 결코 독일국을 가져서는 안됩니다. 그는 독일국에 죽음과 파괴 외에 다른 것을 가져오지 않을 것이기 때문입니다. \n\n 따라서 우리는 일시적인 "반 하이드리히 협약"을 체결하기 위한 회담에 경쟁자들을 초청했습니다. 내전의 완벽한 해결책이 되지는 못하겠지만, 우리가 억누르지 못할 정도로 하이드리히가 너무 강해지기 전에 그를 막을 수단으로는 좋을 것입니다."

"그의 군은 당신의 학생 떼거리가 할 수 있는 것보다 훨씬 빠르고 깔끔하게 일을 처리할 거요." 놀랍지도 않은 적개심을 무시하고, 보어만과는 휴전이 이뤄지지 않을 듯합니다. \n\n 이는 하이드리히를 쉬이 격파하려는 우리의 바람을 산산이 깨부쉈습니다. 다른 이들이 교착상태에 있을 동안, 동시에 우리는 하이드리히를 격파할 것이라는 희망에도 불구하고, 그것은 분명 힘든 도전이 될 것입니다."

 speer.18.t:0 "괴링이 거절하다"
 speer.18.d:0 "헤르만 괴링은 그의 허세로 유명합니다. 그래서 하이드리히를 패배시키기 위한 우리의 휴전 제안이 거부되었을 때 놀랍지도 않았습니다. "군은 SS를 패배시키기 위해 학생들의 도움따위 필요로 하지 않는다"고 말하며, 괴링은 두 일파 간에 연합이 이뤄질지 모른다는 희망을 테이블에서 던져버렸습니다. \n\n 이는 실망스러운 일입니다. 비록 우리 혼자서 하이드리히를 패배시킬 수 있다는데 자신이 있지만, 괴링과 함께 한다면 그 일은 분명 더 간단해질 것이기 때문이죠. 아무래도 우리는 다른 이들과 싸우는 동시에 금발의 짐승을 상대해야 할 듯합니다."

SS는 아마 광범위한 혐오를 받고 있겠지만, 하이드리히는 서러시아 전쟁 이후로 긍정적인 이미지를 유지해왔습니다. 이는 그의 결단력과 스파르타적인 규울에 대해 히틀러가 높은 평가를 내렸기 때문입니다. 분명히, 그에 대한 존경은 힘러에 대한 존경으로 빠르게 변화할 것입니다. 그리고 우리는 독일에 부르군트주의를 추종하는 배반자를 허용할 수 없습니다. 여전히 사람들의 마음 속에 전쟁에 대한 기억이 살아있을 때 그의 행적을 노출시키는 것은 SS에 친화적인 감정을 영원히 무너뜨릴 수 있을 것입니다. \n\n 어떤 인간을 역사의 저편으로 보내버려야 할까요?"

"너무 초조해하지 말게. 외무부에 있는 자네 부하 직원에게 임무에 착수하고, 에르하르트에게 연락하라고 전달하게. 아우토반에서 포드 자동차가 다니는 것을 보려면 아직 갈 길이 멀어.""

"총통 각하, 일본은 우리에게 줄 것이 아무것도 없습니다. 미국은 우리 경제에 이익을 가져다줄 훨씬 많은 것을 가지고 있습니다." \n\n 슈페어는 오랫동안 답하지 않았다. 그는 책상에서 일어나 창문 너머를 바라보며, 수십 년 전 자신이 설계했던 게르마니아의 마천루들을 살폈다. "나도 알고 있네, 슈미트." 슈페어는 슈미트를 돌아도보지 않은 채 나지막이 말했다. "그런데 나는 경제에는 큰 생각을 두지 않고 있네. 미국은 무역 협상을 몇 번 했다고 해서 우리를 향한 은밀한 활동들을 멈추지 않을 걸세. 우리는 군사적인 평행추 역할을 해줄 자가 필요해." \n\n 슈미트는 씩씩대며 말했다. 그가 벌떡 일어나며 의자는 깨끗이 닦인 바닥을 긁었고, 그 소리는 총통의 귀에 그대로 꽂혔다. "우리는 북아메리카를 포함하여 그 모든 도시들을 초토화시킬 수 있는 핵무기를 가지고 있습니다! 일본의 핵무기를 추가한다고해서 세계적 긴장 상황을 경감해주지는 못할 것입니다. 슈페어!" \n\n 총통은 자신의 이름을 듣자 한순간에 분노로 휩싸여 얼굴을 붉혔다. "나는 결정을 내렸네, 슈미트. 그리고 자네는 순방을 다녀오면 되는거야. 우리는 미국과 정상 관계를 수립할 수 있네. 그런데...자네가 생각하고 있는 방식으로는 아니야." 그는 뒤돌아 슈미트의 얼굴을 바라보았다. 슈미트는 떨고 있음을 숨기기 위해 등 뒤로 손을 돌리고 있었다. "대화는 이 정도로 하지. 슈미트. 나가보게." \n\n 외무장관은 뒤돌아 경례도 하지 않은채 슈페어의 사무실을 빠져나왔다. 바라건대, 언젠가 슈미트가 일본에의 접근이 얼마나 지혜로운 일이었는지 알기 바란다."

"그래, 게렌." 슈페어는 두 팔을 벌리며 말했다. "이 모든 정보가 자네가 나에게 가져다 준 것임은 잘 알고 있었네. 자네에게 국내 치안 문제를 어떻게 처리할지에 대해 아이디어가 있다고 하더군. 부디 생각을 털어놔주게." \n\n 게렌은 잠시동안 주저하더니, 역력히 안심한 듯했고 책상에 몸을 기댔다. "총통 각하. 조금 무례한 말일지 모르겠습니다만, 각하께서 게슈타포와 해외방첩청에 고삐를 죄려한다는 것은 정보기관들에서 비밀도 아닙니다. 사실, 그들은 상태가 심각합니다. 그들은 전쟁을 막지도 못할 뿐더러, 독일국 내의 반체제 인사들을 제압하지도 못합니다." \n\n 슈페어의 표정은 여전히 헤아리기 어려웠다. "계속 하게." "전쟁이 끝난 후에, 미국은 방향을 바꾸었습니다. 전시에만 운영되던 OSS는 CIA가 되었습니다. 그들은 실수로부터 교훈을 얻었고, 그에 부응하여 적응했으며, 이제는 첩보 부문에서 우리를 크게 앞서고 있습니다. 같은 일이 이등국가 일본을 상대로도 벌어지고 있습니다. 우리에겐 해결책이 필요합니다. 새로운 시대에 적합한 새로운 첩보부 말입니다." \n\n 슈페어는 잠시동안 이에 대해 곰곰히 생각했다. "흥미로운 생각이구만. 자네 좀 더 구체화된 생각을 가지고 있는건가?" \n\n 게렌은 고개를 끄덕였다. 그는 책상에 서류가방을 올리고 가방을 툭 쳐서 열었다. 그러고는 두툼한 서류더미 하나를 내려놓았다. 앞면에는 '국가정보원'이 휘갈겨 쓰여있었다. "여기 있습니다. 총통 각하. 자세히 알고 싶으십니까?""

IG 파르벤 회장과 달리, 장관은 이상을 추구했다. 이 점이 둘의 차이였다. \n\n "당신에게 IG 파르벤의 해체가 임박했음을 고지하고자 불렀소. IG 파르벤은 여러 자회사들로 나뉠 것이고, 각각은 자유시장 경제 내에서 경쟁활동을 시작할 것이오." \n\n 여기서, 에르하르트는 폭탄 발언을 했다. 그는 각오하고 있었다. 압스는 소리를 지를 것이고, 두 사람은 에르하르트가 밖으로 나가버릴 때까지 서로에게 소리를 지를테며, 압스는 결국 패배할 것이었다. 따라서 그가 압스의 말을 들었을 때 놀람을 억제하기란 어려운 일이었다. \n\n "알겠소. 장관. 독일국을 위한 당신의 노고에 감사하오." \n 에르하르트의 턱은 다물어지지 않았고, 압스는 빙그레 웃었다. \n "당신이 놀라워하는게 보이긴 하오만, 공포스러워하지는 않는구만." \n "당신이 노예제를 폐지하고 자유 시장과 긍정적인 경쟁을 통해 새롭고, 경쟁력 있는 독일을 건설하고자 함을 나도 알고 있소. 나 역시 진심으로 당신에게 동의하고, 따라서 더 말해줄 것이 있소. 나는 몇 번이나 IG 파르벤의 노예 의존도를 줄여보고자 노력했소만, 다른 이사들이 항상 반대하더군. 당신의 솔선수범을 보니 너무나도 기쁘오." \n\n 마침내, 에르하르트는 압스와 악수를 할 수 있을 정도로 충분히 충격에서 벗어나며 이사진 회의에 참여할 필요성을 알려주었다. 에르하르트는 속을 넣은 의자에 등을 기대자마자 자신이 들은 것을 되돌아보기 시작했다. 압스는 거짓말을 하고 있었다. 분명히 그랬다. 그렇다면 왜 그랬을까? 어떤 이유로 2백만 라이히스마르크를 얻기 위해 일말의 거리낌 없이 수천 명을 죽음으로 몰고 갔던 자가 갑자기 노예제 폐지를 지지하게 되었을까? 무언가 잘못 돌아가고 있었지만, 에르하르트는 아무리 생각해도 답을 얻을 수 없었다."

"당신은 여기서 해체당할 줄 예상했을 겁니다. 그쵸? 해체하기에는 지멘스와의 유대가 너무 긴밀하고, 공정한 경쟁에 그다지 위협이 되지도 않더군요. 운 좋은줄 아십시오..." \n\n 에른스트 폰 지멘스는 다시 마음이 복잡해지는 것을 느꼈다. 절반 정도는 충격이 생각했던 것보다 가벼운 것에 안심했지만, 나머지 절반은 크나큰 손실을 한탄하고 있었다. 하지만 그는 안심하는 마음에 집중하기로 선택했다. \n "고맙소, 장관." 그렇게 말하며 지멘스는 자리를 떠났다. 두 사람은 악수했고, 사무실은 다시 조용해졌다."

Our relationship with the USA may change in the future, but for now they are our enemies, and we need to show that we are still a superpower!"\n"Go on, Feldmarschall" came Speer's interested reply.\n"Mein Führer, my plan of action is as follows: we send our Reichskommissars all the troops and supplies they need, while at the same time denying we are at war with the Americans. They won't be able to protest, as they are doing the same as us, and if we manage to prevail, they won't make the same mistake twice in future negotiations!"\n\nBoth plans are sound, and the choice is difficult.

What was different, however, was that the loading operations were heavily surveilled by Heer soldiers: their uniforms were so different, so pristine, and they looked more like bureaucrats than rugged soldiers.\n\nThe garrison commander had talked to the officer leading the operations. Apparently, they now needed to protect the loading operations, but when they asked why the Wehrmacht was guarding shipping procedures usually carried out by privates and mercenaries, all they were answered was that it was "sensitive informations".\n\nNow, they were looking through a list of cargoes, checking the ones already loaded.

I'm eager to help you get this under control. This is an opportunity which will surely keep us out of too much trouble."\n\n"An opportunity for the military, von Tresckow?"

And I don't want them to break ranks and become a problem. I don't want their officers to sow discord, to make us look bad. Showing off our might on the battlefields of Africa and energizing the people so that they would support us even as we remove ourselves from the war would all be great for us in the end. And if we can do this, I can keep working with Speidel to continue our reforms."\n\n"You want to create a diversion? By intensifying the war?" Speer said, trying to understand what he meant by using this "opportunity."\n\n"Yes. This will keep the more troubling elements of our ranks from interfering or sabotaging our plans, and it will also give us better chances at withdrawing from the war. And above all, it would keep Schörner happy," the Prussian said, releasing a sharp but disgusted chuckle at mentioning the bastard from Munich. He continued, "In simpler terms, if we present a strong front, we can commit to our withdrawal without too many worries."\n\n"I see."

In those few months, he had seen what truly was the Wehrmacht: a massive den of corruption, where nepotism, incompetence and division ran rampant. The Truppenführer's favorites never stood guard and got nicer meals, while he had to cover for their turns or risk being accused of dereliction of duty.\n\nAlongside him, four others of his unit had volunteered, attracted by the steep rise in pay. Fedor, one of the former commander's cronies, had been killed by the Amerikaner when he had forgotten to put on his camouflage; the best part, however, had been when Johann, another one high on the list, had tried to convince the new officer to let him off a patrol citing "friends in high places". The officer had pointed the gun at his head, and asked for the names of his friends, then sent him to military prison for attempted corruption and dereliction of duty, and the list of names to Germania.\n\nThe weather was terrible, so humid his uniform was always damp, and so hot that it would still be damp even if it hadn't been so humid.

On the negative side, however, the political landscape is quickly heating up: rallies both in favor and against withdrawal will be held in the next few days, and newspapers fuel the debate by siding with the reformists or the conservative hardliners.\n\nin order to put an end to the growing political tensions, the Führer has decided to hold a speech at Nuremberg. There, he'll explain to the nation why he had to take such a choice, and what will this new course mean for Germany and the larger Reich.

That way, they would be safely out of the hands of the advancing OFN.\n\nThe only price he had to pay for getting everything he could out of harm's way was the loss of territory and influence over Africa to the Americans and their allies. Now, they would be the ones to replace them, out there in the dark heart of Africa.\n\nEven if they do fail to achieve victory against the Fatherland's colonies in that continent, he told himself, we would at least rid ourselves off a sinking ship. The rising costs, the infighting among the governments of the three Reichskommmisariats against one another, and the growing strength of the OFN, all these were just too much for Germany to carry on her own.\n\nHe sighed, forcing himself to review the reports one last time before he closed them up and set them back into the basket.

Today is a great day, a day in which the future of this new, great country is set! After the ravages of the civil war, brought upon us by the corrupt kleptocrats that crowded Adolf Hitler's deathbed, came the unjust invasion of Deutsch-Afrika by the Americans: they took advantage of our momentary weakness to usurp our place in Africa!" he interrupted his speech for the scheduled popular outrage.\n\n"However, we managed to save as many good Germans as possible, because that's what a government does: it protects its people! And I will protect the Reich from its enemies! Unlike those who tried to usurp my predecessor's mantle, however, we shall achieve greatness through peace and reason! We shall be great again, and no one will dare to insult us ever again! Power through peace, supremacy through reason!" and then the applause began, sincere enough not to require the paid claque present as a safety measure.\n\nAs he stared at the crowd, drinking in the adoration, Speer couldn't fail to notice a small movement at the park's corner.

You're all here 'cause...?"\n\nThe crowd took only a moment's pause to consider his words, then, in unison, shouted.\n\n"NO MORE WARS ACROSS THE WORLD!"\n\nWith cheers and whistles, the man chuckled and leaned back from the microphone. "Our first song goes out to Reichskommissariat Hans Hüttig - the old, decrepit bastard!"

It began in the University of Vienna, and spread from there in an almost sporadic-like fashion. Newsreels couldn't resist the opportunity to show footage of thousands flooding the streets, running headlines about punks and students holding down confrontations with police cars.\n\nGoing down to the street view, further reports showed that there was a common message with the protestors. All of them had variations, but they resonated all the same.\n\n"BRING THE WAR HOME!"\n"NO MORE BOYS ON AFRICAN SHORES!"\n"THE REICHSKOMMISSARIAT THREE CAN DO IT ON THEIR OWN!"\n\nMost importantly there was one that was starkly common amidst the protestors, which was the phrase "NO MORE WARS ACROSS THE WORLD!". Police have suspected that this phrase had connotations in Mainz and other cities nearby, and has spread rapidly throughout the entirety of Germany. After a period of three days, with tense stand-offs with police, Vienna began calming down, with the almost-ten-thousand dispersing into less than five thousand, but the voices remained strong, and it seemed like the people of Germany were catching on to the situation in the South African War."

There were too little officers prepared to deal with entire streets packed with people chanting for the war to end abruptly, and those that attempted to calm them were only met with furious rebuttals and, in some rare cases, violent reprisals. Sometimes, people would pass by and picket the Volkshalle, and while they were quickly moved out, it was to the point when the government would be utterly blind to not notice how public opinion has soured.\n\nIt had even come to the point where Albert Speer began taking different routes to the Reichskanzlei and the Volkshalle, in order to not be stopped by protestors and deal with their anger and frustration, and many officials in the NSDAP began travelling more covertly in order to not be harassed likewise."

However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

Hitler and his cronies shunned sensible policy for ideology, and our government intends to rectify his mistakes."\n\n"I have seen the work of your Herr Erhard, and it is most impressive.

The convertible in which they both sat was cruising on a slow parade between blocks of marching soldiers, and Sidos gave his nonchalant wave to each and every one as he passed. Their uniforms were faded and patched, their weapons of such a range that most could only have come from a Breton port, but the look on their faces was one of steely determination. Schmidt had never seen the manual of arms performed with such machinelike precision by what he was told were fresh recruits.\n\n"You see our preparations are well underway, Monsieur Schmidt. France has had its fill of being Europe's whipping boy - when the next war with Burgundy comes, we will be ready." He was wilfully ignoring the litany of treaty violations he was revealing.\n\nSchmidt responded in French himself - when you're selling to someone it's smart to speak their language. "Most impressive indeed. It is good to see France's élan yet remains."\n\n"You are an excellent flatterer, Monsieur, but it will get you nowhere. France has demands no honeyed words can fulfill. Burgundy is a threat to both our nations, one that as much as the French dislike the idea, they must work with Germany to destroy. Your government must commit itself to the destruction of the Black State within the near future. Only then will the French people even begin to consider working with their old enemy.""

Schmidt felt an uncanny sense of unease as they paraded between across the eyelines of the blank-faced troops. Despite their vacant expressions, he could feel their concentrated glares as though he were an ant pinned beneath a magnifying glass.\n\n"France's crème de la crème," Sidos remarked, enjoying watching Schmidt attempt to suppress the involuntary instinct to sweat. "Every one of them French born, French trained, and French armed. We have learned from our mistakes, and will not rely on any nation but ourselves."\n\nSchmidt had been wondering when to bring up this topic, but it seemed Sidos was forging ahead himself. "The Zollverein is not reliance, but cooperation."\n\n"Phrase it however you will, we will have none of it. We can work with Germany, but we will not rely on your arms - not with your history.

Despite the inordinate number of people filling the streets, half the shops were closed, their doorways instead filled with vagrants. As they reached a lull in their conversation, they passed by an overturned bin, in which a street urchin was scavenging - Helmut had thoughts such sights to be confined to the realm of Charles Dickens this far west. He felt a lump in his stomach.\n\n"You see the scars that Germany has wrought upon our country," Antoine finally said, affixing his gaze to Schmidt's.\n\n"Tragic indeed, but Himmler acts of his own accord. We have renounced him, you demanded as much." As much as Schmidt hated to say it, he was here as a diplomat.\n\n"You will find no man in France who sees this distinction. The SS is a German organisation, is it not? Was it not created with the approval of Hitler? Was it not he who granted Himmler the heartland of France, who armed him, whose death led to deaths of thousands?

France has been bound to the hip with the Reich once before, and the results were catastrophic - this is half the reason Himmler was so able to overcome us."\n\n"The economic fumbling of Hitler's days is long over," Schmidt assured him.

He expressed his regrets he couldn't be here himself."\n\n"I bet he's losing his mind. No buildings, just endless complaints." At that Schmidt gave a slight smile.\n\n"You are lucky I am president, for I doubt others would give Germany the time of day. You are here to see our countries allied, and that is good, but for France to be an ally worthy of speaking of, she needs some care.

It is about time the spirit of cooperation overtook the continent, and swept away that of war. Of course, France's interests must be considered."\n\n"This is why I am here," Schmidt reassured, grateful that Bichelonne had left at least some of the job of selling the project to him.\n\n"For France to be truly integrated into the Zollverein, it requires some reconstruction. The war took its toll on our industry, but with Germany's help it can be restored to what it once was.

The words still rung in Schmidt's ears as they walked about the Mayor's Palace, now the de facto royal palace. From his friends in the Reichsnachdienst he had heard Versailles was in no condition to host a king. After the initial introductions Henri had seemed humble, almost embarrassed at the charade, but the idea was still bouncing about Schmidt's brain that he was the first German diplomat to converse with a French king since Napoleon III's defeat at Sedan.\n\n"It is a unique situation we find ourselves in. While I am not one to speculate, I imagine it is about as easy to get France to side with Germany as it is to persuade the French to restore a king." Henri's joke prompted a polite chuckle from Schmidt.\n\n"We live in interesting times."\n\n"Interesting indeed. I am no fool to reject your offer out of hand, but a king must do what is best for his people. My people will never love the Reich, but they could be persuaded to tolerate it, if reparation is made for past wrongs.

While everything in the room was of the finests craftsmanship, it was decorated sparsely, with none of the outrageous luxury one might expect. A wise decision, considering what his predecessor's magnificence had bought them. "I can assure you, the Zollverein is in everyone's best interests."\n\n"So you say, but I am afraid your diplomats do not have the best reputation for honesty." The King gave a smirk at this, and Helmut was forced to concede with a nod. "France must make it's own decisions.

Before he had disappeared, he had presented his final and greatest demand.\n\nSchmidt had not had reason to consider Brittany for some time. The newly formed peninsular state had been one of Hitler's more peculiar ideas, ripped from France in the fifties as part of his divide and conquer strategy. He had heard Erhard cursing the Breton black market for undercutting many German goods in his eternal crusade to fix the economy, but other than that their less savoury entrepreneurial activities they had largely kept to themselves. The Accord of Nantes left them frozen in stasis.\n\n[FRA.GetLeader] had insisted that Brittany once more be united with France. The Accord must be renounced, and France's territorial integrity restored, he said - but the French State was in no condition to mount such an invasion alone. As much as it burned to admit it, they needed German help. "

Then, in the middle of the night he was escorted out, with barely a chance to grab his suitcase. His pilot had evidently been awoken in a similar manner, and was still clad in his pyjamas. His host had not even done him the courtesy of a goodbye. A simple warning from a hulking guard in royal blue was sufficient - do not return.\n\nThis was going to be a short flight, so he would have to think fast about what to tell Speer on his return.

Even a French-Breton phrasebook had been developed, as the local language had overtaken the use of French in some areas.\n\nAir superiority would be easy to achieve, but they would have to be careful planning their naval cordon - Breton smugglers had a thousand and one ways to sneak through a blockade, and it would be preferable to capture the government that they could force a surrender. Actions along the Burgundian border were to be avoided whenever possible - a border skirmish at this time could develop into something disastrous, and Germany would be forced to respond in full force in the event of another Franco-Burgundian war.

And as you also know, we have recently had a shift in administration. Most importantly, as it stands, we are at a precipice. Can you tell us why the Rada should be kept?"\n\nKubiyovich nodded. "Of course. The reasoning is simple: if you wish to keep the population content with your rule, you must give them a semblance of democracy. Besides that, a civilian administration will be less of a burden on the Reich, and will have long-term positive effects on the popular perception of Ukraine remaining in the Einheitspakt." Spoken like a true collaborator, Weidenmann noted.\n\nThe German nodded. "I believe this shall bring our negotiations to a close, Mister Kubiyovich.

With a sly smile, the German diplomat turned to leave the room, leaving Tys all alone, staring up at the flag that was draped across the top of his office. Some would call this a continuation of the German heel pressing down on the Ukrainian neck."

 speerjapan.1.t:0 "An Unwanted Holiday"
 speerjapan.1.desc:0 "The world was not concerned with the wishes of Helmut Schmidt. It was concerned with the Führer's. When the foreign minister had entered the main office of the Reich Chancellory, he knew what the tickets resting on Speer's desk meant. He had objected (and as politely as he could, it must be added) to a focus on Japanese reconciliation. Germania's focus should be elsewhere; anywhere but Tokyo. Schmidt had reiterated his concerns to the Führer, hoping that the old man might see the light, but with the same oh-so-friendly smile that Schmidt had come to hate, Speer placed the tickets in his hands and ushered him out the door.\n\nNow, he stood in Tokyo, those vile white banners with their embalmed blood-red suns taunting him as he left the airport. Hitler's Germany had been abysmal, and Speer's regime had proved only superficially better, but at least both had the humility of a nominal republic. Schmidt gazed out the window at the corrupt symbols of the Japanese nation, an Empire built on the rape of China and the Pacific."
 speerjapan.1.a:0 "For the good of Germany."

 speerjapan.2.t:0 "The "Glory" From Within"
 speerjapan.2.desc:0 ""Our men stand with absolute loyalty to the Führer and the national ideal," Helmut Schmidt said in forced pleasantry to the Japanese men opposite him. One of the younger gentlemen was furiously scribbling on a notepad, looking up at the foreign minister regularly with an expression of wonder and intrigue. "The Wehrmacht is the ultimate disciplined oppositional force to the American threat."\n\nAnd it was the ultimate disciplined force. Schmidt had been only eighteen when he joined the Wehrmacht and had seen firsthand the suffering and carnage it caused. Russian men had been slaughtered before his eyes, innocents and soldiers alike crushed under the heel of Hitler's eastward march. Here he was, however, praising its glories. What kind of monster was he, celebrating the military-industrial complex which had brought Germany's neighbours death and sorrow, before creating the near national suicide of the Civil War.\n\n"How you describe the Wehrmacht would greatly interest the Prime Minister and perhaps our Emperor. I think this meeting has borne some great fruit for future cooperation between our nations." Schmidt sighed. He had succeeded."
 speerjapan.2.a:0 "Victory is such sweet sorrow."

 speerjapan.3.t:0 "The Threat From Without"
 speerjapan.3.desc:0 ""Consider this President. He seems stable now, no?" Schmidt offered to his Japanese interlocutors. "At any moment, however, he can be replaced by a man of completely opposite character. Every eight years, this is certain, but he receives a challenge midway through his term, and his powers risk restraint every two years from that Congress of theirs. Your Empire would do better with a certain partner. Our Führer, like your Emperor, is guaranteed for an entire lifetime."\n\nSchmidt wishes that Speer wasn't. He longed for America's instability. He longed for her progress, made in short jumps, not centurial designs. His career might suffer, yes, but what was a career for the chance of liberation? Certainly, he would prefer honest poverty to his present hypocritical privileges.\n\nThe argument, however, hit home for the Japanese. Schmidt's suited counterparts nodded in agreement with every line, in almost unwavering agreement with the German line."
 speerjapan.3.a:0 "Maybe our old wounds will soon heal."

 speerjapan.4.t:0 "The Blue Scare"
 speerjapan.4.desc:0 "Speer wondered sometimes if Hitler's ghost still roamed the Chancellory's halls. The old Führer still certainly haunted Speer's plans. That fool had the gall for a near assassination, and by the Kempeitai of all people, meaning Germany's population is still suspicious, if not outright hostile, to the idea of Japanese alignment. No matter. A good counternarrative wasn't something the Führer was unused to crafting.\n\nThe Deputy Führer was called into the office and a plan was hatched. Kiesinger's friends in the conservative wing of the Party would be contacted, with warnings of America's capitalist degeneracy infecting the Germany they have worked so hard to perfect. In contrast, the Japanese, our traditional allies in the Axis powers, are icons of tradition, stability and hegemony. Conservative newspapers and radio networks would broadcast this line of thinking, and the country would be brought in line with the Führer's vision.\n\nWashington's favour will falter, but the greatest nations are rarely allied without the blood of another. A sacrifice worthy to sway the German population."
 speerjapan.4.a:0 "Fear never fails."

 speerjapan.5.t:0 "History Rewritten"
 speerjapan.5.desc:0 "Anti-Japanese sentiment in Germany has cooled, but not disappeared. However, anti-Americanism has quickly supplanted its role in the national conscience. In a controversial interview, the Führer told a conservative talk show host that new evidence gathered by the RND suggested that the Kempeitai had nothing to do with Hitler's assassination, and in fact, it had been a CIA operation all along. Polling data today shows that the German pubic's favour for Japan has superseded that of its favour for the United States. A shift in perspective has begun."
 speerjapan.5.a:0 "A job done well."

 speerjapan.6.t:0 "Our Domestic Issues"
 speerjapan.6.desc:0 "Having Japan as our ally again would do more than assist the German economy. It is no secret that our financial and industrial complexes have been historically turbulent, and even with Erhard's best efforts, the heart of Germany's production beats slower than it did in its youth. Trade and liberalisation bring great boons, however. Japanese firms, the Zaibatsu and others, have indicated keenness to invest in the Reich, particularly the Ruhr and our other industrial heartlands. This stimulant, Erhard tells us, will give German companies the push they need to increase their staff sizes and reduce our national unemployment issues.\n\nMoney isn't free, however. The Japanese would like to reach an agreement regarding their side of the contract, wherein we ease our protectionist policies and lift tariffs on their companies. The conservatives of the Reich may not be pleased with this, but it seems like the only choice. The Japanese certainly make it appear as such."
 speerjapan.6.a:0 "For the good of us both, we must break down our walls."

 speerjapan.7.t:0 "Our Call to the Globe"
 speerjapan.7.desc:0 "Japan brings with it possible augmentations to the German machine that will make us a fearsome presence on the world stage. Since our alliance broke apart, our nations have developed technology in isolation, and Japanese science has advanced in ways our Wehrmacht must take full advantage of. Beyond just shared mechanical advances and joint drills, the Japanese alliance brings with it unprecedented geopolitical advantage. With an ally dominating Asia, our spheres would form a co-defensive shield, allowing us to spread our influence without a knife in the back, from them or anyone else.\n\nThere is a, well, peculiar addendum to these benefits. Japan has requested that Germany assist with their 'policing actions', a series of activities Germania has been granted suspiciously little details on."
 speerjapan.7.a:0 "Something wicked this way comes."

 speerjapan.8.t:0 "A Crack in the Facade"
 speerjapan.8.desc:0 "In diplomacy, time is a commodity that must not be wasted. Given the seeming imperative nature of tariff removal in order for economic agreements to be discussed, Schmidt has requested that these negotiations begin effective immediately. However, as Schmidt hangs up the line to Germania, he cannot help but feel that there is more to Germany's new friends in Tokyo than meets the eye.\n\nHe sits in his hotel room with a cigar, pondering. Was it the way they spoke and dress? The over-politeness that made him suspicious? Surely not, as since he was a boy Schmidt had heard of the properness and honour of the Japanese culture. It did not seem out of place. Was it their insistence? But what were they insistent on? Tariff removal, something even old Erhard preached the merits of. It was odd though, the way they pushed it, at every meeting emphasising these economic agreements. He could not shake the feeling that Germany was running headfirst into a trap.\n\nIt was late, however, and the foreign minister crushed his cigar in the ashtray. These were thoughts for tomorrow morning."
 speerjapan.8.a:0 "Beware the Japanese bearing gifts."

 speerjapan.9.t:0 "Japan's Offer"
 speerjapan.9.desc:0 "Had Bismarck been in rooms like this? Had Von Metternich? Was Schmidt following in their footsteps as he approached the Japanese delegation across from him? Daily life in Germania had been exciting, to begin with, but the rotation between the Volkshalle and the Chancellory had become far more mundane than Schmidt had ever thought foreign affairs could be. In these moments, though, he felt that he was acting not as just himself, but as the whole legacy of German geopolitics. In the skies above, those mythical heroes of Germany's ambassadorial tradition, Schmidt liked to think, were looking over him. A blind spot had emerged, however. The daydreams of the Reich's foreign minister were shattering slowly as he, and his delegation, realised that they had been conned.\n\nIn many ways, it was too late. The negotiations had already started, and the Japanese were pressing for the removal of their tariffs. This would, according to the Reich's economist at the delegation, mean Germany would be economically dependent on Japan for almost five years. The holiday to Tokyo, it seemed, had been a little less than a free lunch.\n\nGermany's delegation considered its options. The deal, as it was, could be accepted. Diplomatic relations improve, things remain cordial, and we all return home to Germania after a nice holiday in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Or, we could try and bargain down the tariff removal and perhaps reduce Japan's proposed scheduling as well. Not only would Germany maintain her economic dependence, but Schmidt might just about maintain his life when he next sees Erhard."
 speerjapan.9.a:0 "It's better than Japan refusing any deal. We accept."
 speerjapan.9.b:0 "This deal is ludicrous! Schmidt will push for more concession."


 speerjapan.10.t:0 "Better Than Nothing..."
 speerjapan.10.desc:0 "Germany had been fooled. There was no use denying it. Schmidt would only further prove himself the idiot he appeared to be by fighting against Japan's Trojan Horse. The Empire's offer would have to be accepted.\n\nThe Reich would remove all tariffs on Japanese imports for the next five years. The delegation's consensus, behind closed doors, seemed to be that Germany was on its way to economic vassaldom. For half a decade, the cheaper goods of the East would likely flood and monopolise Europe's market. Schmidt felt that, when he left, it would be with his tail between his legs. However, better he leave a negotiation with an outcome than run from a diplomatic breakdown and ruin all the progress the two nations had made already. What was it the Iberians say?"
 speerjapan.10.a:0 "Que sera, sera."

 speerjapan.11.t:0 "For Your Own Good..."
 speerjapan.11.desc:0 "Schmidt would not be silent this day. "With all respect, my friends, I think this deal is a great mistake for your nation." A palpable expression of shock rippled across the faces of the Japanese.\n\n"Your firms would likely choose to export into the German market more with these tariffs removed, no? This choice, to sell in a market where there's no supply but ample demand, will make your companies very rich. Too rich, perhaps. Think of your Zaibatsus. Does your state need more challenge, more corporate power from a new generation of monopolistic plutocrats? Gentlemen, I encourage you to think beyond the money. We must temper your plan for tariff reduction, and maintain protection for your sake. All the gold in Germania is not worth sacrificing the integrity of your state."\n\nMurmurs spread through the opposing delegation. At the front, the elderly man seemingly heading the Japanese side of negotiations received a whisper from a handsome young man next to him. The senior nodded. "Mr Schmidt, you make a compelling case."\n\nThe room stood still for a millennium.\n\n"We agree to your proposal.""

The Japanese were unflinchingly focused on Schmidt's words. He continued.\n\n"If we open up shipping lanes over these vast distances, and let information or commerce flow past the glare of the United States, should we not expect that they seize it? That they take advantage?" Schmidt swallowed hard.\n\n"A co-reliance of this scale could very well invite Washington right into the heart of our nations."\n\nOpposing Schmidt, the elderly man looked to the delegates on either side of him and thought for a moment. "It is a dangerous world, Mr Schmidt. We cannot be too careful. I will take your advice to the Prime Minister before the sun has set."\n\nContaining his ecstasy, Schmidt responded. "Your action is admirable, my friend.""

"Your caution is admirable, my friend.""
 speerjapan.14.a:0 "Luck never tasted so bitter."

 speerjapan.15.t:0 "A New Proposal"
 speerjapan.15.desc:0 "You would think that the only negotiations on the table were for tariffs. Indeed, the Japanese would have loved for that to be the only subject up for discussion. However, Schmidt had come with an agenda. Germany's next proposal was to be presented, and the Reich's foreign minister was hopeful.\n\nGermany needed investment, and with its Frankensteinish economy still barely putting itself back together, growth was a necessity. Particularly, large corporations had vacuumed up much of the market and monopoly had become the norm for the Reich. Schmidt wanted to request for Japanese investment into the economy, with special focus on the smaller businesses that needed to be jump-started into success and expand Germany's middle class. Improving employment was also a major issue for the new Germany, and a large part of the solution was diversifying the range of employers."
 speerjapan.15.a:0 "How hard could this be?"

 speerjapan.16.t:0 "A Dissapointing Offer"
 speerjapan.16.desc:0 "Japan holds steadfast. The first deal from the Empire is investment, but only in the form of shares of some major German corporations. Not only will this have little effects on Schmidt's hopeful goals of reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth, but will also buy Tokyo influence in Germany's economy with no gain for the Reich. Needless to say, Germania's foreign minister is remarkably disappointed.\n\nSchmidt sees himself with two options. Either Germany accepts this imperfect deal, or keeps pushing for larger concessions, risking Japan's favour."
 speerjapan.16.a:0 "We'll this... lackluster offer."
 speerjapan.16.b:0 "Push for a deal that will actually benefit us significantly."

 speerjapan.17.t:0 "Better Safe than Sorry"
 speerjapan.17.desc:0 "Schmidt sighs, stabbing his cigar into the ashtray. "We will accept your deal." The suited rows of Japanese men in front of the German delegation can barely contain their relief. This arrangement is imperfect, yes, but it is a step in the right direction.\n\nDelegation consensus on the German end finished with an acceptance that the Reich's best interest was to accept the Japanese deal. At the end of the day, some investment is better than none, and Germany's economy is in dire need of all the assistance it can get. Schmidt, and without doubt Erhard, are unhappy with the deal, but pushing the patience of our diplomatic partners is the last result Germania wants from these talks."
 speerjapan.17.a:0 "What a dissapointment"

 speerjapan.18.t:0 "A Welcome Surprise"
 speerjapan.18.desc:0 "Schmidt places the phone down. Erhard, in Germania, has just concluded a short economics lesson for the foreign minister, who adjusts his tie, and then the microphone. "Gentlemen," he begins. "A mistake is being made here, regarding the profitability of these limited investments. Our countries will not be brought together, and neither of our economies will be benefited, unless we are to make a decisive treaty here. If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit."\n\nMurmurs across the table end with the nod of the leader of Japan's delegation. "You make a convincing case, Mr. Schmidt. We are open to increasing the amount of investment in the continuing stages of these negotiations."\n\nSchmidt smiled. This, this he could work with. Now he had options. He could push forward on this trajectory, and win even more prosperity for the Reich, or cash out early and keep the spoils."
 speerjapan.18.a:0 "We've pushed out luck enough."

"We do not trust your case, Mr. Schmidt. The Empire will not increase our investments into the Reich."\n\nFuck. Fuck. Schmidt's rage is palpable, and he knows it. Through gritted teeth, he manages "Germania will consider your proposal thoroughly." As Schmidt reclines from the microphone, however, one cannot shake the feeling that the only thing Germania will be considering is the fury of a foreign minister pushed to his breaking point."
 speerjapan.19.a:0 "Dieser dreckskerl!"

 speerjapan.20.t:0 "Pushing Further"
 speerjapan.20.desc:0 "With the right rhetoric, a prolonged victory was always possible. At least, that's how Schmidt had learned his trade.\n\n"If you are to invest, gentlemen, the destination of your capital is of vital importance." A far more agreeable Japanese delegation than Schmidt had anticipated seemed to move forward, at least in spirit, as a group, listening to Schmidt intently. Schmidt suddenly felt the weight one does when they're the sole focal point of attention in the room. With an undetectable gulp and disguised tension, the foreign minister continued.\n\n"The logical choice, my friends, is to invest in the promising industry of German infrastructure. According to our reports, perfected by the great economists of the Reich under the internationally renowned Ludwig Erhard, the industry is due for a cyclical boom period; very, very soon. With the expansion of more firms across the country, your investments will reap even further profit and have access to a wider market of potential suitors. With these new investments into infrastructure, more firms in the general economy will be established, not just in this specific industry. An efficient road and rail system across the Reich will inevitably lead to a reduction of transport costs, incentivising business creation, and thus the production of new investment partners for the Reich and the Empire." The foreign minister, feeling especially Bismarckian, paused for effect. "Gentlemen, it is basic economics."\n\nNods and mutters of agreement bubbled on the Japanese side. Schmidt, at this point, figured himself well able to read the Japanese crowd. He knew what this meant. Another victory. The German foreign minister smiled, pleased with himself, and knowing that his nation would similarly be pleased. The once magnificent Autobahns and railways of the Reich would now have the funds to be reborn in a shape and condition worthy of the country they span."
 speerjapan.20.a:0 "Like Lazarus, with some assistance"

 speerjapan.21.t:0 "We've Invested Enough"
 speerjapan.21.desc:0 "Look. What we have agreed upon already is a great accomplishment. I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors."\n\nNo response. Damn it! He just had to push it that much further, didn't he? Why couldn't he keep his stupid mouth shut? \n"With all due respect, Foreign Minister Schmidt, relations between our countries are still new, and we do not exactly have investors clamoring to enter the German market given the current circumstances," replied the head of the Japanese delegation. "Were you not satisfied with our already generous offer? We will have to discuss and perhaps even reconsider our previous proposal. My apologies, Foreign Minister"
 speerjapan.21.a:0 "Oh, I'm sure you're very sorry."

 speerjapan.22.t:0 "The Geopolitical Chessboard"
 speerjapan.22.desc:0 "On to the next phase of negotiations. The next topic was easily the second-most important one to Schmidt after rejuvenating the economy for the sake of the German working class: combating imperialism. Or, as the topic was titled at the negotiating table, "non-involvement".\nSurely, as the upcoming round of discussions began, the Japanese would ask Schmidt to provide guarantees that Germany would not get itself involved in internal (or maybe even external) Co-Prosperity Sphere affairs. These were not promises Schmidt wished to make, as he strongly opposed Japan's violent hegemony over Asia, but depending on how many demands he could wriggle the Reich out of, it would maybe be possible for such promises to secretly be empty ones; Germany might be able to assist, for example, the rebels fighting for freedom in Indonesia.\nSchmidt chewed on the fine line he would have to walk if he wanted to seem amicable to Japan's interests while also trying to help the world become a slightly less brutal and evil place."
 speerjapan.22.a:0 "Something no one in power seems to want."

 speerjapan.23.t:0 "Shipping Inspections"
 speerjapan.23.desc:0 "Foreign Minister, there is actually one more issue we wish to discuss. As you are no doubt aware, Japan is currently dealing with certain... rebellious elements in Indonesia. We have reason to believe that there may be certain foreign influence in Japan's internal affairs, and we would like certain assurances from Germany that you are, erm, doing everything in your power to prevent aid from reaching these traitors. We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt." \nSchmidt replied, "Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping... Of course, I understand why you ask this of us." \nSchmidt was not happy with any agreement that would hurt Germany's economic recovery, and therefore its working class. The Japanese delegation knew this, of course. What they did not know about was Schmidt's sympathies towards the Indonesian freedom fighters who, while not necessarily seeing eye-to-eye with Schmidt on every issue, at least had the guts to actually stand up and openly fight facism. But was this worth souring relations with Japan yet again? Germany desperately needed economic partners."
 speerjapan.23.a:0 "We're in no position to argue."
 speerjapan.23.b:0 "But we are in a position to lie..."

 speerjapan.24.t:0 "An Acceptable Concession"
 speerjapan.24.desc:0 "There wasn't any point in ruining Japanese relations over a few cargo checks. They would be a hindrance to Germany's recovery, but not nearly as much of a hindrance as a lack of foreign investment. \n"Very well. You have yourselves a deal. The Reich will allow all shipping to pass through Sphere waters to have its cargo examined in exchange for your valuable investments," stated Schmidt to the Japanese delegation. \nThe pleasantly surprised look on the faces of the Japanese delegation implied they had expected at least a bit of negotiating. Abandoning any chance of helping the Indonesian rebels escape Japan's fascist grip left an uneasy feeling in Schmidt's stomach, but he figured that this show of goodwill towards the Japanese now would at least pay off for Germany later."
 speerjapan.24.a:0 "Let us hope that it does."

 speerjapan.25.t:0 "An Unexpected Concession"
 speerjapan.25.desc:0 "Schmidt simply could not allow a deal which would impede Germany's path to economic recovery, but he also couldn't risk pushing away the Japanese altogether. Why not, then, attempt a compromise? \n"It would be very difficult for Germany to make sufficient profits on exports to the Co-Prosperity Sphere if a bottleneck is created in your shipping lanes. But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments." \nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. And it seemed to make sense to the Japanese as well. Resignedly, the head of their delegation responded, "Yes, that would be an acceptable compromise. But of course we insist we receive all of your inspection reports so we know exactly what is entering our waters." \n"That will be no problem at all," replied Schmidt jovially, knowing this would be enough for him to at least somewhat help the Indonesian rebels in their fight against Japan. He supposed it was the small victories that really counted."
 speerjapan.25.a:0 "We've pushed the envelope enough."
 speerjapan.25.b:0 "But we could push it even more."

We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments." \nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. But it seemed to be quite unsatisfactory to the Japanese delegation. Stiffly, the head of the delegation responded, "No. We must insist upon inspections of German cargo. We cannot utterly compromise our national security for the sake of speeding up your shipping! I am afraid that if you cannot agree to this, we will be forced to reconsider our previous agreements." \nWhoops. Now the Japanese would likely inspect German ships with a great deal of suspicion and care. Schmidt felt his face redden with embarrassment and frustration as he forced himself to accept Japan's initial demand. There would be a sizable economic price for Germany, and possibly the ultimate price for the Indonesian rebels who were now out of reach."

 speerjapan.27.desc:0 ""This is never going to work." Schmidt muttered, an unlit cigarette forgotten in his hand. Speer held his own cigarette in his mouth, occasionally letting out a puff of smoke. The two men watched each other warily before Schmidt continued. "My Fuhrer, to ask the Japanese to let us check our own ships for arms is one thing, but to ask to help with cutting off the American boats too? They'll never do it."\n\n"I believe it's worth the risk, Helmut. I mean, if there's one thing we have in common with them, we don't like the Americans much." Speer responded calmly. "Besides, some ammo and weapons always go, ah, missing on patrol, if you catch my gist." Schmidt scoffed and pulled out his lighter.\n\n"If all of my work falls through because of this. . ." Schmidt grunted as a secretary entered, holding a new report. Both men watched silently as he placed down the letter, embossed with the official seal of the Japanese Embassy. Slowly, Speer opened it and skimmed the paper, settling onto one sentence. He placed the paper down and looked at Schmidt, a grin crossing his face.\n\n"They're in.""

"You've gone and fucked it all up!"\n\nSpeer, for his part, held his own bravely against Schmidt's assault. "Helmut, I pushed for the best deal we could get, and it didn't work out. Not everything does. It was always a risk, you know."\n\n"It wasn't a risk, it was diplomatic suicide! Since when has Germany offered to send PT boats to Indonesia just to "cut off the Americans"? Of course they'd see through that! I don't understand it, my Fuhrer, I really don't." Schmidt sighed. "I had a deal and everything, too. One that wasn't too bad for our interests, or at least didn't ruin our relations."\n\nSpeer shrugged. "Again, we gambled and we lost.

 speerjapan.29.desc:0 "The office of the Japanese Ambassador was significantly cleaner than the Fuhrer's. Tasteful artwork lined the walls, and the desk sat organized and clean- a departure from the chaos of Speer's room. Schmidt sat across from the Ambassador, hands in his lap. "It's quite simple, really. Our two nations both hold technologies that the other would like to know. Relations, of course, have been historically. . .strained, and as such, our technological cooperation has been all but non-existent. I propose that we should rectify this oversight, for the benefit of both our nations."\n\nThe ambassador regarded Schmidt calmly, tapping his hand on his table. "I see." He began. "But what sort of technology would we be sharing?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "Depends on what we agree to." The ambassador continued to watch Schmidt closely, the two men looking for any betrayal of either's ulterior motives. After a moment, the man stood.\n\n"Technological sharing would certainly be a boon for us both. I like the idea, Schmidt." He said. Schmidt smiled- it was a good start."
 speerjapan.29.a:0 "To work, then."

 speerjapan.30.t:0 "Opening Moves"
 speerjapan.30.desc:0 "The shutters of the Ambassador's windows were closed today, giving the room a sense of privacy. Schmidt took his seat gently as the Japanese ambassador watched him, the fluorescent lights in the roof giving off a bright glow. The ambassador began. "So, Schmidt, what is the Reich interested in obtaining from Japan?"\n\nSchmidt cleared his throat. "The Kriegsmarine and the Heer have both expressed interest in some of Japan's advancements. Navally, it is no contest- the IJN clearly outpaces our underwater capabilities. On the ground, I believe we are about even, but some areas are certainly more advanced in Tokyo than in Germania. Hell, there may even be some parts of your air doctrine we could use. In short, the Heer asks for some of your military advancements, and we are more than willing to pay for them."\n\nThe ambassador pondered for a moment before replying. "I would hope so, Schmidt, but I do not believe the IJA or IJN are as willing to hand over their secrets as I am. However, I've been reassured that neither branch has an issue with sharing some of our RADAR and communication techs. Would this be an acceptable compromise to you?"\n\nNow it was Schmidt's turn to go through the options. "I take it this is not a take it or leave it offer?"\n\nThe ambassador smiled. "Depends on what you say next. I'm sure I can do some convincing, if needed.""
 speerjapan.30.a:0 "Yes, we can do that."
 speerjapan.30.b:0 "Allow me to retort, if you will..."

 speerjapan.31.t:0 "The Easy Solution"
 speerjapan.31.desc:0 "Schmidt read Speer's letter with a mixture of annoyance and resignation. It was everything he had expected it to be- perfunctory, disappointed, and with the barest hint of congratulations smeared over it. Of course Speer would be disappointed- he never had to actually talk to the Japanese. He just got to sit back and reap the rewards.\n\nOf course Schmidt could have pushed harder. The ambassador had left it open. The issue was, of course, that trying to push it was risky. If Schmidt had gambled and lost, would Speer say "Oh, that's ok. You tried your best."? No, of course not. He'd be just as disappointed as he was now. He clearly didn't understand, thought Schmidt as he sat down in his chair, just how tough it is to negotiate a detente with a power that you've been actively threatening for decades. Sure, they didn't get everything they wanted. That's how compromise works. They got something, and they get the detente that was so important. I'd call that a win myself, Schmidt thinks.\n\nHe sighed as he grabbed his lighter and a smoke. Speer never seemed to understand the finer details of international diplomacy. In the end, Speer was only an architect, not a diplomat. Maybe he'd never understand the finer points of negotiation.\n\nSometimes, Schmidt really hated having to work for him."
 speerjapan.31.a:0 "Good enough."

 speerjapan.32.t:0 "In Deep"
 speerjapan.32.desc:0 ""Well." Schmidt began, eyeing the Ambassador's watchful gaze. "To go through all this effort just for a few radios and communication advancements would be quite unsatisfactory, in my opinion. I believe that we can certainly do more with each other than just that."\n\nThe ambassador tilted his head. "What do you suggest?" Schmidt's eye's shifted around the room as he thought.\n\n"Attaches, perhaps, to aid our military. Plane technology- those bombers of yours have quite a range, perhaps that would be a useful tool for our Luftwaffe. Hell, maybe even some naval technology, like gun computation or navigation, or perhaps anti-air capabilities."\n\nThe ambassador stiffened in his chair. "And what do you propose to give us?"\n\nSchmidt smiled. "I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?"\n\nThe ambassador thought for a moment, and an uncomfortable silence entered the room. Schmidt did his best to hide the rising tide of worry inside of him. Finally, after what seemed like forever, the ambassador responded. "I believe that is a workable compromise.""
 speerjapan.32.a:0 "Good to do business with you."

"I'm sure the IJA would be pleased if we offered some of our Heer technology. Perhaps some of our armor advancements?" \nAn uncomfortable silence entered the room. Everyone stared at the head of the delegation, awaiting his response. "We cannot accept this deal. I can see that Germany is enthusiastic to share technology and cooperate with Japan, and Japan does indeed feel the same way. But I predict this is simply beyond what our armed forces are willing to accept, and we have no desire to push them to do so." \nThat was unfortunate. Though for Schmidt, the issue was not the failure to develop Germany and Japan's militaries, but merely relaying this failure to Speer who would no doubt be angry. Ultimately, it wouldn't really matter too much, Schmidt supposed."
 speerjapan.33.a:0 "Ah well."

 speerjapan.34.t:0 "A Reluctant Deal"
 speerjapan.34.desc:0 "Schmidt hung up the phone angrily. He hated negotiating for things which would only bring more harm to the world.

If they ended up at war with a power strong enough for Germany to need such a large navy, it would probably be the end of the world anyway. Sighing, Schmidt left his hotel and returned for another day of diplomatic negotiations. \n"Good day to you all. While we recently came to an agreement on an exchange of military support for some of your technology, Germany would actually be interested in taking this deal further. We understand that Japan has made major strides in naval technology, and Germany is very interested in the fruits of these advancements. We are prepared to offer you a substantial sum for it... in cash." \nEyebrows raised, the members of the Japanese delegation pondered and privately discussed Schmidt's offer for a moment before coming to a decision. "Seeing as we won't be fighting you in the foreseeable future, we see no reason not to sell you our advanced naval technology. Now then, shall we begin negotiating the price?" asked the head of the delegation, who made little effort to hide his greed. Schmidt nodded, hiding his disdain for the wasteful deal he had himself just brought to fruition."

 speerjapan.36.t:0 "An Urgent Start"
 speerjapan.36.desc:0 "Our ploy to gain a great degree of control over the German economy is only thinly veiled. \nAs soon as he received our request to eliminate trade tariffs for five years, German Foreign Minister Schmidt immediately called our diplomatic office from his hotel and requested that trade negotiations begin as soon as possible. While we would not exactly refer to this request as a trap, it seems that Germany's sharp and quick-witted foreign minister senses our... ulterior motives. \nThere is a great degree of logic to opening diplomatic relations with the Germans, but why shouldn't we get as much out of it as possible? We'll offer to remove tariffs on each other's goods for five years, which will yield us a great amount of influence over the German economy during that period. If you want global power and influence, you're going to have to twist some arms. Let the German delegation come and negotiate with us tomorrow, and we will see just how much Japan stands to gain from their desperation."
 speerjapan.36.a:0 "Let's see if they look their gift horse in the mouth"

 speerjapan.37.t:0 "Not as Easy as we Thought"
 speerjapan.37.desc:0 ""With all respect, my friends, I think this deal is a great mistake for your nation." Already, a bold claim. "Your firms would likely choose to export into the German market more with these tariffs removed, no? This choice, to sell in a market where there's no supply but ample demand, will make your companies very rich. Too rich, perhaps. Think of your Zaibatsus. Does your state need more challenge, more corporate power from a new generation of monopolistic plutocrats? Gentlemen, I encourage you to think beyond the money. We must temper your plan for tariff reduction, and maintain protection for your sake. All the gold in Germania is not worth sacrificing the integrity of your state."\nWell then, it seems he had thoroughly thought things through before the day's negotiations. Any mention of the Zaibatsus challenging Japanese state power was already enough to turn many heads among our delegation. While it was more than certain that Schmidt was trying to maximize the potential negative consequences of our proposal because he didn't like it, his point remained valid and hung in the air stubbornly.\nThe head of our delegation had the opportunity of holding firm on our existing offer or accepting Schmidt's counteroffer of shortening the lifting of tariffs to three years with the Germans showing no preferable treatment to the Japanese market. It would not be as beneficial for Japan, but perhaps there was some sense in trying to smooth relations with Germany..."
 speerjapan.37.a:0 "Mr. Schmidt, you make a compelling case..."
 speerjapan.37.b:0 "...but we cannot agree to your proposal."

 speerjapan.38.t:0 "A More Limited Deal"
 speerjapan.38.desc:0 "Would Helmut Schmidt ever be satisfied with what we offered? Even after we allowed him to negotiate us down to a less extensive tariff removal agreement, he has continued to try and push us further. "To be frank with you all, I am still not entirely sure that the deal we have arranged in its current form is all too beneficial to Germany or Japan. I think we can do better."\nThe foreign minister had to know he was getting closer and closer to a line he should not cross, but he must have been willing to do whatever it took to secure the best possible outcome for Germany. In the name of cooperation and friendship, maybe we could concede to him a little more?"
 speerjapan.38.a:0 "Yes, that wouldn't be the end of the world."
 speerjapan.38.b:0 "Enough is enough, already!"

 speerjapan.39.t:0 "Another Point of Discussion"
 speerjapan.39.desc:0 "We had thought the only topic of our negotiations with the German delegation would be tariffs, but German Foreign Minister Schmidt had come with an agenda.\nSchmidt requested assistance to the German economy in the form of Japanese investments into small businesses and to help increase employment. The look on his face while he made the proposal indicated that he was genuine and passionate in his desire to help the German people get back on their feet, but we above all needed to ensure that whatever deal was struck was beneficial to Japan. Our delegation discussed the matter before giving the foreign minister our proposal."
 speerjapan.39.a:0 "Some shares in their largest corporations will wield us some influence."

 speerjapan.40.t:0 "They Ask for More"
 speerjapan.40.desc:0 "It was too good to be true, but we were still dismayed to find that the Germans were not satisfied with our rather one-sided investment proposal. Foreign Minister Schmidt cleared his throat to gain the attention of the conference room and began speaking powerfully.\n "Gentlemen. A mistake is being made here, regarding the profitability of these limited investments. Our countries will not be brought together, and neither of our economies will be benefited, unless we are to make a decisive treaty here. If Japan sends more of it's good investors to Germany, not only will Japanese investors make more money, but your Empire will reap the taxable benefits of this prosperity, and our firms will be encouraged to issue more stock. It is an exponential cycle, gentlemen, and both our great nations stand to benefit."\nMurmurs consumed our delegation all across the table. There was certainly opportunity to be had in increasing Japanese investments in the German economy: more profits, more influence, and improved diplomatic relations with the Germans for a start. The head of the delegation came to a decision:"
 speerjapan.40.a:0 ""You make a convincing case, Mr. Schmidt.""
 speerjapan.40.b:0 ""We do not trust your case, Mr. Schmidt.""

 speerjapan.41.t:0 "A Larger Investment Package?"
 speerjapan.41.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt took a sip from his glass of water and gently placed it down on the table. It had already been a long day of negotiating. But it appeared he wasn't finished for the day just yet. "Look. What we have agreed upon already is a great accomplishment. I strongly believe, however, that further Japanese investment into the Reich's infrastructure would be even more beneficial to both of our nations. Any risk you may perceive in such investments, I assure you, only exists in the immediate term as we continue our ongoing recovery efforts from the internal conflict. As the Reich continues to regain its footing and reclaim its spot as the world's foremost economy, any hint of doubt regarding our situation will rapidly fade away. And, of course, such great economic collaboration now is guaranteed to foster strong economic ties between our nations in the future and improve the Empire of Japan's image in the eyes of the German people... and investors." \nReally? After the generous investment package that we had already offered, the German foreign minister asks Japan for more? The coy look on Schmidt's face provided no insight as to whether these investments would turn the easy profit he said they would. But it was possible he had a point... maybe there would be a substantial economic and diplomatic yield in the long run?"
 speerjapan.41.a:0 "There is no reason not to seize upon this opportunity."
 speerjapan.41.b:0 "We have given you enough already."

 speerjapan.42.t:0 "A Delicate Request"
 speerjapan.42.desc:0 "Before any deal could be finalized, it was important to ensure that the Co-Prosperity Sphere's internal security would not be impacted by restoring trade with the Germans. An uncomfortable but necessary request would have to be made. A quick phone call asking to initiate negotiations regarding a new issue quickly summoned Foreign Minister Schmidt back to the negotiating table. \n"Foreign Minister, there is actually one more issue we wish to discuss. As you are no doubt aware, Japan is currently dealing with certain... rebellious elements in Indonesia. We have reason to believe that there may be certain foreign influence in Japan's internal affairs, and we would like certain assurances from Germany that you are, erm, doing everything in your power to prevent aid from reaching these traitors. We ask that all German ships travelling through Co-Prosperity Sphere waters be submitted to cargo checks prior to entry. Understand that this is essential to the Sphere's internal security, Herr Schmidt." \nSchmidt replied, "Searching every single vessel to pass through the Sphere's territorial waters could greatly hurt our profit margins and slow down our shipping... Of course, I understand why you ask this of us." \nOf course the Germans would not be happy about having their shipping inhibited, but there was no other choice."
 speerjapan.42.a:0 "Let's see how he responds"

 speerjapan.43.t:0 "Another Counterproposal"
 speerjapan.43.desc:0 ""It would be very difficult for Germany to make sufficient profits on exports to the Co-Prosperity Sphere if a bottleneck is created in your shipping lanes. But we do acknowledge your internal security concerns. How about we make official inspections of all cargo ships before they leave Germany to ensure that no materials are being smuggled in order to undermine Japanese sovereignty? We both get what we want: you maintain your national security and we maintain profitable trade and investments." \nThe counter-proposal made sense to Schmidt. But of course he was just trying to protect his own country's interests. Still, that he would so boldly try to slip Germany out of these shipping inspections was a grave insult to the Japanese delegation. How could he understand the troublesome position the Japanese Empire was in? Actually, if he knew how bad things were in Indonesia, he might even gain the upper hand in the negotiations. We would be weak to back up on our initial demands now, but it is not out of the question if we really want to show the Germans our desire to work with them."
 speerjapan.43.a:0 "I suppose we can give them the benefit of the doubt."
 speerjapan.43.a:0 "No. Let us inspect your ships or kiss our investments goodbye."

 speerjapan.44.t:0 "A Ridiculous Counterproposal"
 speerjapan.44.desc:0 "The German foreign minister entered the room quietly, his face expressionless. Was he agitated about something? "I've received a proposal from our authorities to submit to you. In addition to performing our own cargo checks on shipping entering your waters, the Reich actually wishes to assist Japan in fending off American vessels sending aid to the Indonesian rebels. With our naval support, you can cover much more ground and more efficiently patrol for enemy supply ships." \nWas this some kind of sick joke? There was no way that the Germans were making this offer from the goodness of their hearts. Was there? Why on Earth would they offer their resources to protect Japanese waters? This was most likely a ploy to undermine Japan's security, and perhaps even to sneak through support to the Indonesian rebels themselves. The Japanese delegates sat silently, masking their rage and shock at hearing such a blatant diplomatic slap in the face. They did realize that Japan could in fact use the help that was being placed directly in front of them, but did they dare to assume that the Germans' audacious proposal was at all legitimate?"

Even a softening of Japan's deal became a worthy price to pay for detente and friendship with the Reich's old accomplice. Economic dependence was something that could be justified in return for security, trade, technological development and all the other merits that allies bring.

Have a lovely remainder of your evening, and we will continue tomorrow," replied Schmidt with a casual smile on his face. \nHe had done it! He had secured what was, to him, the most important thing for the German people: an actual source of stimulus for the economy! Schmidt had realized there had been no need to push the Japanese on even more investment when he'd already successfully pushed them to increase the size of their investment package. He couldn't have risked the livelihoods of the workers and families of Germany on trying to net more than he had even bargained for. \nUpon informing Speer of the sealed deal, the Führer even had to reply, "Well done, Schmidt." If even Speer was satisfied with his work, then Schmidt knew he had done more than well enough."

He had decided it was best to avoid provoking the Japanese delegation anymore after they had already agreed to allow Germany to check its own shipping before being sent to the Sphere. It would still slow down trade and hurt German profits, but it beat having ships being stopped for cargo checks in Japanese waters- that would have been a much worse bottleneck. \nEverything Schmidt did was in the name of improving the lives of the German people. If he had to make some concessions that would in the long run provide him more opportunities to help, then he would do it. Besides, the negotiations with the Japanese were far from over."

He didn't bother asking for any more than what had already been agreed upon, both because he didn't want to overreach and destroy the chance of any deal being signed, and because he didn't think he could stomach helping his or any country to make war more than he already had. \nThere was, however, no more time for Schmidt to ponder the morality of his actions. More negotiations with Japan would continue tomorrow, and maybe then he would get the chance to do something that would help instead of hurt the world."

There was no Kempeitai agent watching over his shoulder as he wrote his signature on the paper authorizing the secret weapons shipments and beginning of RND operations in support of the Indonesian rebels fighting the Japanese Empire.\nOnce he had finished signing the document and submitted it, Schmidt felt both incredibly relieved but somehow still awfully tense. He knew he was doing the right thing. Any help he could give to those who were bravely fighting against Japan's fascist hegemony over Asia was something to be proud of.\nSadly, Japan was enforcing a strict system of inspecting all German shipping entering the Sphere's waters, but sneaking a few small ships through with arms and RND agents was still doable.

Such a degree of foreign assistance was almost certain to bring victory to the cause of Indonesian freedom, and to shift the global tide against ruthless hegemonic powers such as Japan.\nAt this point it almost seemed like Schmidt was able to help everyone in the world attain freedom except his own people."

This was exactly why Schmidt had suggested to Speer and the RND that only a few small, isolated black sites were set up across Indochina so that there was no way the Japanese would ever find them.\nSchmidt scanned the document nervously and let out a large sigh of relief. All of the planned sites had been smoothly created after the RND agents had secretly landed on various desolate beaches across the vast jungles of the region. Due to the caution that had been employed, they were disconnected and poorly supplied, but this was much better than nothing.\nNow he had to sit back and wait as the reports on the RND's activity gradually came in over the coming months.

Because Japan had allowed Germany to "check" its own cargo shipping before leaving port for the Sphere, it was somewhat easier to sneak agents and supplies to Indochina than was initially anticipated. This was exactly why Schmidt had suggested to Speer and the RND that they set up a moderate quantity of RND black sites throughout the region; enough resources to actually gain helpful intelligence but enough caution to hopefully avoid being caught by the Japanese.\nSchmidt scanned the document nervously and let out a large sigh of relief. All of the planned sites had been smoothly created after the RND agents had secretly landed on several beaches along the vast jungles and hills.\nNow he had to sit back and wait as the reports on the RND's activity gradually came in over the coming months.

We'd simply like you to reaffirm that you're not forgoing any of our pre-existing agreements and that you're not giving any special or preferable treatment to the Japanese."\n\n"Oh, is that what this is about? You can tell my friends in the White House they have absolutely nothing to worry about. Our new administration is simply opening the Reich up again to all sorts of foreign partnership opportunities. The Germany of isolation and conquest is no more, and that's all there is to it, Ambassador."

Lowering tariffs too much might mean that many newly established German companies might not be able to compete with the low prices of the massive Japanese corproations, causing many to go bankrupt.

Trading technology with Japan could allow us to study it and improve our own consumer focused innovation.\n\nHowever, as with industrial goods, we run the risk of growing overly reliant on Japan's technology which would allow them to have a greater sway over our regime."

erhardnomics.1.t:0 "Kartellgesetz"
erhardnomics.1.d:0 "Cigar smoke wafted strongly in the room as Ludwig Erhardt flicked open a lighter to continue the trend of making it just a bit more difficult to breathe in the room. In front of the man with a plan sat, reading over a document, the Führer himself - Albert Speer. He had been holding a hand to the side of his head, occasionally stopping up to gaze at a certain piece of text before either sighing or rubbing his forehead and continuing. "Herr Erhard," the old Führer began, looking up at the Minister who seemed to look just a little bit happier when they met eye-to-eye. "This law of yours... the Kartellgesetz. How do you propose we push this through? After all, the most affected would be the four biggest companies in Germania. And...", "And what, my Führer?" Erhard calmly shot back, puffing the cigar and pulling it out of his mouth. "What would they do about it? Complain? Certainly, they would," Erhard stopped up, blowing out some smoke and taking another puff, "but consider this. They would practically be admitting to keeping each other in business in a big charade. And that..."\n\nA small grin approached his lips. "That wouldn't reflect so well on the 'Aryan' spirit, now would it?" He said, almost seeming to be mocking the notion of such a thing. Speer glared at him as if Erhard just gutted an animal in front of him, but eventually took a deep breath, and then an even deeper sigh. "If you would be so kind as to listen," he strained, subconsciously pressing a thumb down on the document, "I can tell you that they have tools at their disposal. Allies. Influence. If we begin with something like this, then we run the risk of..."\n\nErhard chuckled, shutting the Führer up quickly. Throwing the used-up cigar out into a nearby trash bin, he simply crossed his arms and shook his head. "Hostility? Yes, but this is the easiest way to begin approaching them. If you don't want the Reich to be dominated by giant corporations that effectively run the state for you, my Führer, then I suggest that you take my suggestion, or I'm afraid that my ideas end here." Speer wanted to say something. Something that could turn the case against Erhard, but there was nothing. If he hadn't had a medical check-up recently, he swore he could've felt an aneurysm coming. "And believe me, my Führer, I have a lot more than just the dismantlement of cartels in mind."\n\nThe old minister's gaze sharpened, and Speer felt like he could read exactly what the man had in mind."
erhardnomics.1.a:0 "What have I gotten myself into..."

erhardnomics.2.t:0 "The Reich's Needs"
erhardnomics.2.d:0 ""My Führer..." Erhard began, splaying his fingers out across the map of Europe, pointer finger placed on the heart of the Reich. "I understand that you have some incessant need to plunder the countries you control, but all that would lead into is a slow deterioration of relationships with the other Zollverein members." He looked up towards Speer, and saw the glint in his eyes. This wasn't good.\n\n"Herr Erhard, you should understand the main principle of this union between countries. It has never-" Erhard felt like he wanted to put a rip on the paper right where the capital was- "A benevolent, equal partnership." Speer put both of his hands on the table and looked down, then splayed one over the territories beyond the Reich. "These are territories we have conquered all fair and well in a war that we started. If there is anyone to be determining who gets what, it shall be us." The minister licked his lips. He could've gone for a drink right about now. "Is that really it, my Führer? Just a sentimental want to..." There was no way Speer could have believed in only that, could he? "... My Führer, I hope you have a very good reason to stick to this tenant of National Socialism. The only road this can take is down."\n\nSpeer took his hands off the table and clasped them behind him. "I don't know what you want to hear out of me, Herr Erhard, regarding this issue. I believe there never was an issue to begin with. The members of the Zollverein may not be happy about it, but they have nowhere else to turn to. In the end, they can only return to the Reich." Erhard swallowed, taking concentrated breaths. "What is it that you want me to do now, then, my Führer?" He asked, nearly failing to conceal the anger in his voice. "Isn't it obvious?" He rhetorically asked. "I want you to alert Herr Kiesinger that the Reich's policy remains the same.""

erhardnomics.3.d:0 "The smoke that came into his view while staring through his binoculars confused him for a second before he realized that, no, Warsaw wasn't burning, that was just the cigar in his mouth. Still, he was surprised that Speer rounded up enough political capital to get this many men out and this much equipment. Perhaps it was simply the sheer obviousness of his arguments? Erhard chuckled softly when he remembered how Speer tried to argue against reinvesting into Warsaw and Kyiv. Something vague about the Reich expressing strength by showing the Poles and Ukrainians that resistance was meaningless, but even then Erhard could have seen that he wasn't really believing the argument himself.\n\nNo - what was more likely was that Speer was a snake who thought that he could give a minimal damn about making the Reich seem to be more than just the crushing iron grip of Europa that needed to be removed. He was no National Socialist, certainly, but he could see sense to reason. Or perhaps he did, but was too afraid of the clutches of democracy? Erhard found that both funny and frustrating, but before he could continue looking at the construction project mobilizing men and equipment, he felt a shake on his shoulder.\n\n"Herr Erhard," the voice said, and it took him a moment to process that it was actually the project manager. Lowering his binoculars and turning his head, he raised an eyebrow. "Yes?", "If I may ask, why Warsaw and Kyiv?" It didn't take him long to respond as he shook his head. "Besides being potential industrial heartlands? Well, I suppose there's another reason for it. These are some of the most hardest hit areas of Generalplan Ost, and starting here could perhaps earn us the goodwill of the non-Germans living in these areas." He could feel the cold gaze of the manager on him, only tamed by the fact that he was much higher up than the man. "Well?" Erhard started up again, returning his own glare. "Are you staring at me? Zoning out, perhaps?" He continued, voice filling with irritation and sarcasm. The manager gave him no response, seemingly confused and worried by Erhard's words. "So? You're not? Out with it, then! Is it something you wish to say? Or do you perhaps have nothing to tell me?" He could see the manager visibly swallow. "Then go! You have a project to be overseeing, don't you? Oversee it!"\n\nIt took Erhard a solid minute to calm down after he left. What was he even thinking, starting dialogue with a man like that?"

But now they were here, Erhard drinking a small glass with strong alcohol while Schmidt was more modest, deciding on some wine instead. With a pleasant sigh, the minister of the economy spoke. "The resignation trick works every time. Really, I wasn't expecting him to be so asinine about it. It's like I was asking him to instate elections." Schmidt let out a short laugh. "No, God no, if it was like that I think he'd ask you to resign instead." Erhard himself chuckled, and would have reached for a cigar had that not been allowed in the restaurant.\n\n"I suppose, however, that you can tell me more details about this plan of yours?" Schmidt asked, prompting Erhard to sober up a little and listen to what the Foreign Minister had to say. "Yes," Erhard began, nodding. "It's quite simple, it's just that the plan will take a long time to implement. I'm aiming for Germany's colonies to industrialize sufficiently, you see." Schmidt nodded. "If we want them to stand as partners, they can't be so reliant on the old home that any economic crises would make them buckle and crack, just as it happened in the fifties. Instead, you're going to, with my help, turn all of those colonies into shining, rich jewels. Not on par with Germany itself, but at least enough to be a little self sufficient."\n\nSchmidt nodded again - this time more clearly satisfied. A smile graced his lips as he spoke. "But what of the consequences? What if they demand independence?", "We'll give it to them," Erhard stated flatly. "Eventually. If Speer isn't a fool, he'll let us build the base to feasibly stop exploiting them. If he is a fool, however..." Erhard sighed."

erhardnomics.5.d:0 ""Think, my Führer," Erhard started, turning his head away to blow smoke through a window. "Consider the consequences of forcing the Zollverein to remain dominant of the Reich. If we do that, all we're setting ourselves up for is a future failure of our sphere." His words stung cruelly, and Speer relented on uttering a swear before turning to look to Helmut Schmidt. "And you?" Speer asked, voice tightened somewhat. Schmidt nodded politely, then showed a hand towards Erhard. "He's right, my Führer. If we decide not to liberalize the Zollverein, then we'd be running the risk of eventually turning the members turning against us. Just look at Japan and its sphere as an example. The tensions between the members and Japan are palpable."\n\nWas Speer really hearing this? Now two out of the four members of the Gang were nearly directly coercing him into following through with their demands. And if he decided to raise a voice? Protest? Then only the obvious would have followed. Letting the air in the room stay thin for a few seconds more, he finally decided to speak. "Erhard." He stated, turning his gaze to the man. "Let's say we do liberalize the Zollverein. In the future, what's to stop them from dreaming about detaching themselves from the Reich? To pursue a light at the end of the tunnel? After all, if we are so benevolent now, then the implication would be that we can continue this benevolence for the future. And this... would not bode well for the Reich."\n\nErhard's eyes narrowed, and his teeth grazed against the skin of the cigar just a little bit harder. Taking it out his mouth, he sighed. "My Führer, you have it backwards. I understand that you hold a more traditionalist position on this, but it doesn't mean that everyone that isn't Ge-- the Reich, is unreasonable. But for exactly the reason you initially described is why they would not leave us." Speer leaned back, stare softening only slightly. "After all, what do they gain out of leaving a mutually-beneficial partnership? Pride?" Erhard shook his head. "They already lost that a while ago. They would have only to gain by staying, and nothing by losing. This," he paused, taking a puff of his cigar, "Would only happen if you let this reform pass." An air of silence passed between them for many seconds. Both men in front of the Führer wondered what he planned on staying-- before he pushed his chair back and stood up. The expression on his face spoke a thousand words."

A company that serves as a true testament to Abs' profit-driven motives, and the costs that come with it.\n\nIG Farben is a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate. On a surface level, it is nothing more than a megacorporation, pulling its strings across all of the Reich, its colonies, and further abroad than that. Under the helm of Hermann Josef Abs, it has risen to become one of the most powerful actors within the government, not only having wide scale influence in large parts of the Unity-Pakt, but fielding their own private mercenary company, as well as a heavy, if not total, reliance on brutal slave labor. Having reaped the rewards of a victorious Reich, Abs has certified his reputation of what it is to be successful as a German. Out and active, he has crafted a carefully-made image of an apolitical yet loyal businessman, serving the interests of the Reich.\n\nYet under the guise of an honorable and capable man lies a bloody history driven by a single desire. Hermann Josef Abs, under the wraps, is an incredibly cunning and ruthless man. It can be safely claimed that his economic empire stretches from sea to shining sea, and that his business acumen remains one of the most unrivalled in the whole world. His reach extends to every continent, and IG Farben only remains to be one of the many companies under his repertoire, with many more scattered around the world.\n\nIn the homeland, however, is where Abs makes his capital, and something can clearly be said about IG Farben and its shadow ruler - it is a threat. A threat not only politically and economically, but morally as well. It stands as a testament of success to relying on slave labor-- an idea unworkable in the long run, yet here it stood as a shining jewel in a pile of riches. If Erhard is to collapse this rotten structure from the inside out, all his genius would be for naught if not firstly invested into the largest threat that stands before him. A titan which will force Germany to bend under a system that cannot hold forever.\n\nHermann Josef Abs is a force."

In fact, quite the opposite. If the minister played his cards right, he could potentially get a powerful ally on his side.\n\nBut that's not to say that they're completely innocent. Ernst von Siemens has gotten his way to the top, after all, which does not mean he relied purely on honest business practices and sheer skill. Instead, it has signed into a contract with every other factory to form cartels. Now placing themselves in a position where they can remain untouchable by anyone who isn't as wholly massive as they are, the Siemens empire prospers greatly at the top, and it isn't quite certain how they will react once Erhard begins his plans.

This time, they shouted in unison.\n\n"SIR, YES, SIR!"\n\nHowever, what would have been a simple interrogation process turned out to be much more. When the sergeant went up to announce to the guards that the factory was being seized, that's when he spotted it. They weren't normal security guards. They wore a set of all-too-familiar clothing, and a bullet struck his combat helmet before he dropped to the ground and yelled into his radio that a firefight had begun.\n\nIt wasn't a very long firefight. Half an hour later, and the noise had died down into a strange silence. "Men? Report casualties." The radio crackled back soon after.\n\n"Sir, we have two dead and five wounded." He felt a pang of anger strike his heart. "Goddamn SS," he muttered, turning over one with his boot to see the symbol of the Schutzstaffel emblazoned on his chest. "Of all the companies in the world, these traitors employ these assholes." Spitting on the man's red-tinted shirt, he opened up the radio channel again. "How many slaves are wounded, soldier?" He asked, and the reply he got unnerved him, even if he didn't care much about the slaves. "It's a bloodbath in here, sir. It seems like the SS started firing on the slaves after they initiated a firefight with us. It's... there's not many of them left, sir.""

No, now that was going to be a thing of the past, something to be looked at in shame. At least, he hoped that's how history would treat it. Whatever road it would go didn't matter in the moment, however, as he looked over an analysis of who owned what in the Unity-Pakt.\n\nA chuckle escaped his lips as he took a puff from his cigar. Before, entire regions of Germany and its partners would be shaded in solid colours, but now? Now only one colour dominated the battlefield, and those four megacorporations that were left were reduced to nothing but small dots and sometimes even stripes to indicate conflicted ownership. Staring at the map for a moment longer, Erhard nodded to himself. With his economics plan put into full force, he knew that the people - and, most importantly, the middle class - would thrive from this change of pace.\n\nWhen Erhard eventually left his office, he took a slight detour and made sure to pass where Speer was currently residing, just to take a look at the man's expression. With only a quick stop by the door, he could glance at the man shuffling papers, his face showing only uncertainty. Erhard felt satisfied with what he saw, and left before Speer could notice the minister laying about. With another puff of the cigar, Erhard smiled to himself."

Now he could do it knowing that he wouldn't have something looming over his mind as he did. The vehicle in question was Mercedez-Benz W108 vehicle. It was a few years old at this point, and there were other choices available to him, but this car struck him out as pleasing to the eye, and, as he rode in the streets of Germania, felt the quality of its build on the concrete streets. These cars weren't built with trembling slave hands. Instead the design was constructed by a healthy, paid German, one who specifically studied and prepared for that sort of job.\n\nNot only that, this car he bought did not come from some far-reaching company that employed millions upon millions of slaves. Instead, it was by a factory sold off to a middle-class family at the behest of the government. And to really drive the point home, Erhard made sure that anything built by German hands alone would be specifically marked as being such. If his plan blossomed fully, that would mean that eventually, that label would apply to every German product.\n\nStepping out of the car in the parking lot, Erhard looked over the vehicle once again. This could be sold abroad, even - fall into the hands of an American family that could appreciate German technicality repurposed for more benevolent means. He was almost certain that Speer would look at him with a worried expression if he said that out loud, but at least he would consider the proposal of exporting German goods to beyond just the Unity-Pakt.\n\nWith the theorizing done with, Erhard began his service of the Reich that morning. Things needed doing, papers needed to be looked at, and..."

For what he lacks in size, Flick makes up for it by cutting through the stock market and working company-owned slaves for every last drop of blood. He is merciless, and a prime example of a Nazi brought into the modern generation. But that is not why he is so dangerous.\n\nIn Erhard's eyes, being connected to the black heart of Europe known as Ordenstaat-Burgund is already a horrific sin. Flick, however, goes above and beyond that, being a man who has direct ties to the abomination that leads the whole project - Heinrich Himmler. Not only that, but Erhard knows that he has directly supported the cause of the SS with monetary compensation. And so, in order to further the Einheitspakt of the devilish ideology known as the Burgundian System, Erhard must strike hard at Friedrich Flick and his empire."

speer.500.d:0 ""Gentlemen, a toast!"\n\nGlasses clinked together as Erhard let out a chuckle. Then, from the group of five, it was the most powerful Wehrwirtschaftsführer, Hermann Josef Abs, who spoke. "Say, then, Herr Erhard," he began, cutting into his finely-made steak. "The tide turns strongly, doesn't it? In just a few years short, we've gone from our old Führer to something fresh and exciting." Another, Friedrich Flick, the Wehrwirtschaftsführer of Daimler-Benz, shot him a glare, but Abs merely ignored it.\n\n"Oh," Erhard began, downing a shot glass. "I agree. I like our new direction. Now, if I may call to attention why I brought you all here in the first place." All eyes landed on Erhard - from Abs, to Flick, to the silent Edmund Geilenberg and the curious Ernst von Siemens. "As you're aware, the Speer administration will be doing a multitude of things. Reforming the army, strengthening the economy, loosening up diplomacy, and maybe laxing a few laws of old here and there. That's all well and good, but my personal interests lies in the problem that's faced Germany for decades. I'm sure you all know what that is."\n\nThe air seemed to still around them. Geilenberg spoke first. "I will hazard a guess that this is about the slaves." He bluntly stated, and Erhard's smile merely grew. "Correct, my friend. All of your companies-" Abs' steady supply of smoke from his cigar stopped. "-... well, to make it easy to understand, they're going to be dismantled." The group collectively tensed up, and while Siemens was the least tense, Flick seemed like he was on the verge of rage. "I knew I shouldn't have come here!" He shouted, kicking away his chair and standing up. "This folly of ruining my business. Erhard, I won't let you take away a percentage of my workforce! Not when I have anything to say about it!" Erhard took a single puff of his own cigar and crushed it into the tray. Leaning forward, he grinned, and the rest remained deathly quiet as he spoke."

So when they met, it was during a walk in the Volkshalle, traversing the cold, long and massive halls of that place as they spoke.\n\n"Go over your plan again, will you?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger found it simple to oblige.\n\n"It's a several-step plan. In no particular order, I would like to deal three issues. First, it is difficult to keep conquests held, especially if it is from people that hold contempt from us. Wouldn't you agree?" He asked, and Speer gave a wary nod. "I propose a solution. We can either reform the Reichskommissariats into natively-organized collaborationist governments, or turn them into Reichsländers. These would be a more... seperate-but-equal deal. Not preferable, and potentially unstable, though it would please the conservatives."\n\n"Go on." Speer said, flicking open his lighter for a cigarette. "The other two problems?" Kiesinger nodded. "The second is the issue of slavery. It's killing us, and we'll need to tackle it carefully. That is a plan I will draw on later, but all of us must cooperate on it. The last is dealing with the economy. Besides the megacorporations, we'll have to revive businesses and..." Speer's face contorted into slight annoyance. "Speak with Erhard. I'm aware, my Führer. Don't worry, however. I know how to deal with him." Speer let out a sigh. "So that's your plan, then? In that case, I advise you begin as soon as possible.\n\nKiesinger smiled. "Of course, my Führer.

speer.502.d:0 "In the early 1940s, with our war industry unable to rally enough hands to maintain supply of new goods and equipment, we turned to the one resource we had in quantity that remained unspent: flesh. Millions of prisoners - untermenschen, POWs, political enemies - occupied the concentration camps, being worked to death or starved to no end beyond extermination. As Armaments Minister, Albert Speer gave them a different fate entirely: to work, day and night and unto death, in the German war machine. Rather than breaking rocks and being tortured at the whim of SS guards, they would work the forges and assemble tools of death for the Wehrmacht.\n\nIt seemed like a good idea at the time. Most men of fighting age were enlisted or conscripted to fight the plutocratic democracies of the West or the Bolshevik menace of the East. With women relegated to more appropriate roles, we were in desperate need for hands - any hands - in our factories. Without the mass employment of forced labor, we could not have produced the mountain of armaments that allowed us to crush our foes with an ease that no capitalist economy could have matched. Slave-forged tanks, guns and planes were as essential to our victory as strong German souls.\n\nHowever, slavery has grown completely out of control. No longer constrained by the state, our industrial leaders have developed a monopoly on the use of slavery, locking most of the German populace out of blue-collar jobs. Even agriculture has no room for free workers, as Prussian land magnates rent tens of thousands of slaves on the cheap from corporations like Reichswerke and IG Farben. For this plague on the Reich to end, the power of the megacorporations must be permanently broken and the deprived masses set free - no matter the cost."

The more ground we give, the more we legitimize it, and that's the one thing we must avoid at all costs. They'll expect a dozen concessions for every single man and woman set free. We can't have any of that. If Speer doesn't have the backbone to go for their throats, we'll do it ourselves."\n\nKiesinger looked equally bemused and weary. "I can't help but notice you've already turned this into a joint effort on our part, Ludwig. Remember that if one of us goes down, so does the entire cabinet."\n\nErhard stubbed out his cigar in the fancy brass ashtray on his desk and smirked grimly. "That's exactly the idea behind this push. Remember, we still have a dictator on our side. Yes, this will kill relations between the state and industrial leaders, but that's what we want. Speer has already made himself quite popular, and if we can make a true abolitionist out of him, the people will never forget it. From there, the downfall of Abs and his clique will be set in stone.

"Well, my Führer, they were designed to your specifications. I'm sure the fine young men in the propaganda ministry are doing their jobs as best they can."\n\n"I'll ignore that comment, Parteikanzler," Speer muttered as he glanced disparagingly at a particularly unconvincing poster. "I mean, really - look at this." He slammed one down on his desk and threw the rest of them over his shoulder, temper exhausted. It was a photograph, showing a smiling, far too well-fed man in the striped pyjamas of a concentration camp inmate shaking hands with an equally jubilant and healthy-looking bureaucrat in full Party uniform. 'From Masters and Slaves to Brothers and Friends' was stenciled on the bottom in bold, yellow lettering.\n\n"It is a bit on the nose," conceded Kiesinger. "But it's a hard sell, my Führer. It is slavery, after all."\n\nSpeer shook his head. "No, Kiesinger, I told you: they're not 'slaves'. They're 'foreign workers' or 'involuntary laborers'. We have to make sure our narrative stays consistent."\n\nKiesinger sighed. "Apologies, my Führer, but there's no sense playing with semantics. They are what they are. It's a bitter pill that the entire nation will have to swallow at some point."\n\nThe Führer looked lost. God only knew, his subordinate thought, what could be running through the back-channels of his conflicted mind. "Fine," he said after several seconds' silence.

speer.505.d:0 "After a great deal of debate - often fuelled by alcohol and conducted in a haze of cigar smoke - the Führer and his cabinet have finalized the solution to the long-standing question of slavery. As anyone knows, the approximately 40 million slaves in the Reich cannot simply be granted manumission en masse and set free. That would result in little more than social and economic chaos across Europe, along with a great deal of bloodshed.\n\nThe first and most pressing concern is of course the nationalization of slavery. As long as slaves remain private property, they remain vulnerable to excessive exploitation and the whims of uncaring industrial corporations. Placing them under the exclusive stewardship of the Reich Government will ensure that they are well protected and given more humane treatment - an important step in rehabilitating our image as a more benevolent empire.\n\nThe second step is repatriation. The overwhelming majority of slaves are Slavs, predominantly of Polish and Ukrainian origin. Thankfully, we have extensive records of the slave system and can track each and every one of them. Starting shortly after their nationalization, the slaves will begin to be organized and sent back to the countries of origin in a steady stream. Though slow at first, we expect this 'Rückführungsprogramm' to pick up speed as the freed slaves become more cooperative and see that our intentions are true."

With no more wars to fight and no possibility of advancing through the ranks, Herr Weber was forced to try his luck in the blue-collar job market. That, as most of the populace could tell you, was a futile endeavour.\n\n"I hadn't realized during the war," Weber recalled, "That the corporations on the home front would be so exploitative and cruel. I wholly believed in the Führer's promise that they were at his beck and call. Perhaps they were for a time, but when I returned home they had no work to offer. Not for myself, my family or my friends. Two men from my unit - men who had lived through both Barbarossa and the West Russian War - committed suicide because they could find no purpose in their daily lives once the Wehrmacht no longer needed them. Their old employer had been bought out by IG Farben in the early 50s."\n\nAs I spoke to him recently, I never would have thought that his life was ever so difficult. A few years ago, Herr Weber was living off the pittance that his pension would grant him; now, he is a proud greengrocer who runs his own business (pictured below). Here, he sells fresh produce from local farms, turning enough of a profit that he was recently able to purchase a home for his family. They now live in a modest but splendid country home just outside of Stuttgart.\n\n"Of course, I owe all of this to the new Führer," Weber told me with a smile. "I don't really understand economics, but whatever he's done has already given me a life that I'd given up on long ago.

"Good, good. That'll feed into the economic side of things. Great thinking. As for my own field... I think this round of reforms will be a lot more difficult than the last one."\n\n"The megacorporations, yes," replied Kiesinger. "They certainly won't make our endeavour easier, that much is certain." The Parteikanzler smiled knowingly as he sipped his Franconian wine. "I'm sure you had a plan of attack drawn up years ago, though."\n\nErhard chuckled, downing his cutlery. "Well, naturally. It just makes sense to have contingency plans, doesn't it? I doubt even Herr Hitler could fault me for that. You see, I-"\n\nKiesinger held up a hand. "Just the shorthand version, Ludwig. Economics isn't my forte."\n\nThe old economist rolled his eyes.

The madman counting trees. He wondered if a Russian leader had found some humor in the same idea he found just now.\n\nHe eventually stood up, walked around his desk, and out of his office, absentmindedly going through the corridors of the Chancellery, thinking about the things he and his government were free to do now that those people of the likes of Schörner would finally be out of here.\n\nHe stopped by a portrait of Adolf Hitler, studying him in a more civilian attire. The Fuhrer once looked up to him, owing him for the opportunities given to him. He earned much from what Hitler did.

"Simply put: we need the Mittelstand back. Small- and medium-sized businesses were the bedrock of the German economy right up until Hitler started handing out government contracts to the Party's biggest donors. We all know how that turned out. We've put a lot of effort into building a middle class - they'll be crucial to our new policies. We have to rely on the established corporation as little as possible from now on. Don't issue them new contracts, don't engage with them, don't indulge their requests."\n\nSpeer paused for a moment.

Immediately, the new alliance prepared to defend against what would later become the Unity-Pakt. All mountain borders, from the Balkans to the Pyrenees, were fortified, but none so much as the Alps: the frontier between the Italian Empire and what was once Austria is a single, gargantuan fortification spanning more than two hundred kilometers. Bunkers, pillboxes, trenches and sheltered walkways dot the Dolomiti, and while the icy peaks may seem pristine to the casual observer, they hide deep underground galleries and ammunition depots, and anti-aircraft positions encased onto the mountains. Like a cursed mirror reflecting the evil within the hearts of men, identical defences can be seen on the German side.\n\nIn the end, the German attack never came, as the Reich collapsed under its own weight like a clay-footed goliath, but the fortifications remained, and even now, thousands of Italians and Germans look at each other from the ramparts, the ingenuity of such fortifications only surpassed by the hate they were built with, as if the very concrete echoed the feelings of betrayal and anger of the Italian people."

This, however, didn't stop the Swiss from taking interest in the rest of the world, at first by selling their soldiers to a Europe in constant war, and then by developing what is perhaps the largest banking system in the world. Respected by all, and equally distant from all, the Swiss government ensures that war stays as far as possible from its idyllic mountain paradise.\n\nAs he reads the latest reports from Schmidt, who is desperately fighting against the diplomatic equivalent of an incendiary bombing perpetrated by the Italian delegation, Albert Speer can't help sighing. Why did he agree to such onslaught? If not for the sake of working with the Gang of Four, he never would have wasted time in such an endeavor, one which will most likely end in failure. Still, he has been dragged inside this mess, and now he has to help his Minister against an enemy who wields diplomacy with the same skill their ancestors in the Italian city-states did centuries before: one third high culture and fine wines, another one charisma and sharp words, and the final third daggers and poison hidden behind a smile.\n\nPutting down the report, he reaches for the phone and enters the number. After a few seconds, an overly-eager voice answers: "Your Excellency, what an unexpected call! What can I do for you?" to which the Führer replies: "Ambassador Chenaux-Repond, I call you for that matter you mentioned to Reichsminister Schmidt last week. The Reich would be interested in expanding Swiss banking operation within Brandenburg, but in exchange, I have to ask you to act as a mediator in our current diplomatic talks with the Italian Empire" immediately comes the answer: "I will inform the Federal Council of your most generous offer at once, Your Excellency. Please wait until tomorrow" and then the call ends."

speer.516.d:0 "As our delegation has agreed to grant concessions to the Italians in the future treaties between our countries, now we face internal indecision on the actual size of such concessions, as the various factions within the government try to convince the Führer.\n\nReichsminister Schmidt and his followers agree that we should show the full extent of our good will, and try to convince the Italians that we truly want to build an entirely new relationship with them. The conservatives, on the other hand, refuse to humiliate the Reich by granting the Italian Empire the upper hand, and insist for token concessions which will nonetheless please their delegation. Finally, the Führer himself is trying to act as a mediator, and could find a middle ground in substantial concessions, but nothing major.\n\nStill, the arguments from all sides are very convincing: the matter is now in the leader's hands, in what direction will the helmsman decide to steer his ship?"

speer.9999.d:0 "Speer's stomach dropped into a pit. "They can't all be gone. Why would they be?"\n\nThe secretary looked lost and more than a little afraid. "Their offices are all cleared out. Their homes, too. The Bohemian Orpo reported seeing Schmidt in Prague this morning, but nothing more. Herr Gehlen has suggested that they've fled the country after..." he cleared his throat. "After the direction your last conversation took."\n\nSpeer could barely force himself to speak. "You are dismissed," he mumbled. As the secretary left his office, the enormity of the blow struck the Führer like a hammer in the gut. The Gang of Four was no more. Just like that, they had walked away from his grand project, from the promise of a better future for the Reich. There would be no more economic reform, no more charming the NSDAP, no more keeping the Wehrmacht in line and no more hope for positive relations with the rest of the world. It didn't seem real. Surely it couldn't end like this?\n\nHis phone rang, startling him out of his fugue state. He paused for a moment before lifting the receiver to his ear and steadying his voice. "Hello?"\n\n"My Führer," came the gravelly, condescending voice of Hermann Josef Abs. "I hear you're in need of some assistance with your economic policy. If I might be so bold, myself and some particularly eminent National Socialists have a proposal for you...""

erhardgo4.1.d:0 "Smoke had long since displaced any clean air in the room, despite the cracked windows. The meeting had overshot its expected length by over an hour, and Erhard showed no signs of stopping the torrent of figures that somehow poured from his mouth while he chewed his cigar. Even those with more of a head for figures had begun to tune out - Speer's eyes glanced towards the others seated at the table. The various hangers-on were frantically flicking through papers, trying to keep up. Kiesinger was doing his best to appear interested but Albert recognised the glassy look in his eyes. Reichsminister Schmidt was making his own way through the tome Erhard had provided, tilting his head and nodding at some paragraph incomprehensible to human eyes. The Führer redirected his attention back to the economist as he seemed to be coming to the end of some point.\n\n"...tax exceptions and exemptions abolished, tax deductions reduced drastically, and the implementation of a true fixed rate income tax."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows raised at this sentence. "You know as well as I do that our industry relies on those tax breaks, Friedrich. The Reichswerke reinvested half of what they saved on new equipment this year. How much are you proposing for this tax?"\n\nReichsminister Erhard took another drag of his cigar, worked it about his mouth and exhaled across the table. "Forty percent." \nAt that, slumped necks straightened and eyes refocused. Speer coughed, and not because of the smoke. "That's... ridiculous." he settled on, unable to think of a better word. "IG Farben alone will have my head. They've been paying less than twenty since the war."\n\nFriedrich didn't appear ruffled, just inhaled more smoke. "Ridiculous it may seem, mein Führer, but I can assure you it is quite sound. The people have been holding the burden of taxation for decades. Regressive tax policies may expand industries, but they have become bloated. Forcing the industrial conglomerates to pay what they owe while allowing the people to spend more will force a new equilibrium, one they'll appreciate far more than those fat slaving bastards at Farben did."\n\nThe Führer once again took stock of the room. Schmidt's eyes had brightened, and his nods turned from the paper to Speer. Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow looked sceptical but kept his thoughts to himself. Deputy Führer Kiesinger leaned over to Schmidt, hoping to glean some of his knowledge."

erhardgo4.2.d:0 ""Telephone for you, mein Führer."\n\nSpeer glanced up, ready to deliver a rebuke at being interrupted mid sentence, before he realised he had been expecting this call. There were few others who could demand a conversation with the Führer in this manner. He sighed, and gestured for the phone. The ministers sat about the table looked variously confused and intrigued - save for Erhard. He simply leaned forward in his chair.\n\nSpeer held the receiver to his ear. "Speaking."\n\n"Mein Führer," the voice drawled, barely pronouncing the honorific before turning to business. "I'm sure these new tax rates haven't escaped your attention. They must be corrected at once."\n\nIG Farben may have been the biggest name on Herr Abs' business card but it would certainly be pressed for space. Close to fifty of the Reich's largest businesses boasted him on their board of directors. Few others could speak to Speer so brusquely.\n\nThe Führer looked down at the tax papers that decorated the table this very moment. He wasn't remotely surprised they'd leaked, considering the magnitude of IG Farben's influence. "Hermann. You called at an ideal time." Not a hint of sarcasm showed on his face, though a hint of a smirk tugged at Erhard's lip. "We were going through the plans, and your input would be appreciated."\n\n"Then you can sweep them off your desk. You know damned well what those tax breaks do for us, and you can be sure everyone in my phone book will know they're going by the end of the day." The phone went dead.\n\nReichsminister Erhard chuckled. It seemed like he didn't need to know what Abs had said. "If I may mein Führer, I don't think it necessary to respond. The opinion of a man like him is not something you need to worry about.""

erhardgo4.3.d:0 "Ludwig surveyed the sheets of figures arrayed across his desk, his domain. The incomes and expenditures of every Gau, Reichsgau and Reichsland in black and white. He had directed his Ministry to spend the last week gathering this data - Gauleiters did not appreciate intrusion into their affairs, preferring to think of themselves more as lords to be left to their own. Once gathered it was just as monumental a task to sort through, but for the knowledge he gained he would pay any price.\n\nThe Führer had proved more easily moved than he had expected. Perhaps he was sincere after all - one does not ignore the richest man in the Reich on a whim. The numbers didn't lie, and while there had been a short term income drop it had been more than made up for by the sudden and vast flow of currency between the hands of the Reich's citizens. One Mark is not one Mark but many, holding value for every transaction it is used in, and taking the money out of the pockets of men like Hermann Josef Abs was a good deed in itself. They could complain, but if things kept going this way their oligopolies would be on the way out. "

The economy will bounce back, people will spend more, small business will become profitable once again! What hold does he have over you, damnit?"\n\nAlbert recalled a moment, back as Minister of Armaments and War Production. He had to fight to hold the position of course - Hitler didn't tolerate anyone who couldn't carve out their own sphere. It required ambition and ruthlessness. The first, he had known he had. The second, not so much.\n\n"I've heard excellent things, Herr Speer. Your designs for the camps have been most impressive."\n\n"Thank you, Herr Himmler. The true trouble was acquiring more workers, of course, but Sauckel has proven most resourceful. If events proceed as planned, we should see upwards of a million voluntary labourers from the east. Of course we will require more.""

erhardgo4.5.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Flat Income Tax"
erhardgo4.5.d:0 ""What the fuck do you mean he did it anyway?" A vein throbbed in the Führer's forehead. His grip on the telephone tightened. Kiesinger quietly took in the office until Speer gave an exasperated sigh and put down the phone with more force than was necessary.\n\n"Erhard has announced this tax plan of his to half the damned Reichstag."\n\nAs the Führer leaned back in his chair, Kurt commented "Ludwig is like a dog with a bone with these things, but this is far even for him."\n\nSpeer rubbed at his eyes. "Economists are more trouble than they're worth. The whole economy is more trouble than it's worth. Tell them it's cancelled, tell them it was a spy, I don't care, just shut him up before he does any more damage."\n\n"Albert... I'll admit I was sceptical, but this plan of his has merit. People need this kind of change, and reining him in now may be far more trouble than it's worth. And men like Abs need kicking down."Speer's mind flicked back, fifteen years perhaps? The Volkshalle dome, his magnum opus. Twenty companies selling materials. Four selling people - Poles, Ukrainians, Czechs. Abs had shares in every one of them. How many were buried in foundations?"
erhardgo4.5.a:0 "Perhaps there is method to his madness."
erhardgo4.5.b:0 "They cannot know the magnitude of my mistakes."

erhardgo4.6.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Flat Income Tax"
erhardgo4.6.d:0 ""Then I'll resign."\n\n"That won't be necessary."\n\n"You mistake me, Albert. I WILL resign, if you do not back this plan. You would prefer to deal with Abs? One of the greatest slave owners in human history? Fuck him." A scowl had built on Erhard's face, and he ground his cigar out into the ashtray.\n\nSpeer blinked. An ugly look built behind his eyes. "The hell are you talking about? I am your Führer. You do not resign without my say so. You do not do anything without my say so. You will fix this." The Führer spat the last sentence. The other around the table glanced about - it was only the inner circle now. Erhard was at the opposite end of the long table for once. Kiesinger and Schmidt sat in the centre, opposite another. They were each alternating glances between the economist and their Führer. Generalfeldmarshall von Tresckow stood by the window smoking a cigarette.\n\n"I am fixing this. I am trying to fix the mess of the past 20 years of mismanagement. And if you won't let me do that, I don't know why the hell any of us are here."\n\nKiesinger and Schmidt had both raised their heads, but it was von Tresckow who spoke first. "He's right." Henning paused, giving Speer and Erhard a chance to break their locked gaze. "You're here because people believe the Reich should be different. If you don't give them that - if they think you are just like Bormann, or Göring? You'll be swinging from a gibbet with the rest of us."\n\nThe normally turbulent atmosphere of the room calmed as each of them imagined the scene."

erhardgo4.7.d:0 "Speer sat in his lavish office. The last rays of the sun were coming through the tall windows, and the many lights of Welthauptstadt Germania beginning to flicker on. There was a decanter of brandy on the luxuriously lacquered desk, which the Führer was willingly partaking in.\n\nErhard had announced his resignation earlier that day. Even if Speer wanted to stop him going he couldn't have - and why would he? He had defied every order he had given him. Still, the man had been good at his job. Schmidt and Kiesinger had apparently retired for the day, and somehow Albert didn't think they would be far behind. He couldn't have Erhard killed, not now, and without them? He'd always been an outlier in the party. Hitler had sheltered him while he'd built his little sphere, but without him he relied on men like Tresckow to keep the army happy, or Erhard to fix this bloated mess that was his Reich.\n\nNow he was all alone.

erhardgo4.8.t:0 "Erhard's Demands - Minimum Wage"
erhardgo4.8.d:0 "Speer scratched his chin and looked sideways again at the proposal laid out on his desk. "I don't understand, Herr Erhard," he said into the receiver. "I thought economics didn't like the idea of minimum wages. What are you advocating them for?"\n\nErhard's voice, even through the phone, was coarse, bold and full of pomp. "We aren't unified in that position, my Führer. Indeed, I think it's probably essential to furthering our economic recovery."\n\nThe Führer began tapping one finger on his desk, a nervous tic he'd acquired from many a heated debate with Erhard. "Well... Herr Erhard, I do respect your expertise, but if you're in the minority that makes your position on this tenuous. That's to say nothing of what the industrial leaders will think of it."\n\n"The industrialists?" Speer could hear the sarcasm coming. "Oh, I'm sure, my Führer. I'm sure the industrialists - the men who've grown rich from not having to pay their workers at all - have a far more well-considered perspective on this than your hand-picked economic minister."\n\n"Spare me, Erhard," Speer sighed. "Just explain your reasoning."\n\nThe old man wasted no time. "As long as we lack a minimum wage, we face a twofold problem. First, the people won't have any confidence in the jobs being offered to them. Why go looking for work when it will barely make a difference to your income in the first place? Second, right now our economy needs to be shifting goods and that can't happen if consumers lack purchasing power. Follow through with this plan and you'll see the difference in mere weeks."\n\nSpeer's finger stopped. The logic was sound... but what would the corporations think? Surely they knew a thing or two about economics - if they opposed this so stringently, could there be some merit to their arguments? "Thank you, Herr Erhard," he replied after a few moments. "I'll consider your proposal.""

erhardgo4.9.d:0 ""I told you this would happen!" Speer snapped, waving a fistful of indignant letters in Erhard's face. "See these? All from Reichswerke's major shareholders. That's not all, either! IG Farben has had their board members calling me all morning demanding to know what we're up to! They'd have been happier if I'd declared myself a communist!"\n\nErhard waited for the Führer to quiet down and lean back in his chair. "And what about the common man, my Führer? What does he think? What about the students, or your supporters in the Reichstag?"\n\nSpeer looked mortally offended for a brief moment before gritting his teeth and responding. "The Reich doesn't operate according to the wishes of the mob. I understand the dangers that kowtowing to the corporations poses, but-"\n\n"Oh, fuck the corporations!" bellowed Erhard, shooting upright with hands planted on the table, nearly biting his cigar in two. "Do you honestly think they have the Reich's interests at heart? They've grown fat on the profits that slavery offers - our economic situation is at least fifty percent their fault exclusively! If they hadn't been given carte blanche on German industry and put in a position to back your opposition, you wouldn't have faced such stiff resistance in the first place!\n\nFor the most powerful dictator on Earth, Speer suddenly felt very small. "Don't raise your voice to..."\n\nErhard's next words cut to the bone. "Our dear friend Benito once said that to make a people great, you have to send them into battle even if you need to kick them in the pants. The same's true even for a Führer! If you know what's best for Germany and its people, you'll heed MY advice and not that of some bloated, psychopathic slave-driver. Good day, Herr Speer.""

'Vienna Retailers Enjoy Biggest Boom Since 1938' read one headline. 'IG Farben Reports Major Quarterly Loss' said another.\n\n"You should have more faith in Erhard, my Führer." Kiesinger's inoffensive voice cut through the fog of Speer's thoughts, prompting him to glance up. The Deputy Führer was relaxed and cheerful-looking, not to mention entirely too correct in his assessment to yell at. "The Party's economists are all too politicized or corrupt to stand up for what the Reich and its people need."\n\n"I suppose," Speer grumbled, going back to his reading. "He's not the one who's been dealing with the backlash from executives and shareholders, though."\n\nKiesinger leaned forward onto the desk, hands folded, to get Speer's attention again. "Isn't that a price worth paying? Isn't having a few angry men to put in line a lot better than having the entire working class starve because they continue to live off the state's loose change?"\n\nThe Führer felt a little less tense suddenly, but was careful not to show it. "Yes, well... yes, it is. I suspect we'll feel the political repercussions for some time yet, though." He downed the last survey and looked straight at Kiesinger.

"Kiesinger," he mumbled.\n\n"Kurt, it's Helmut," came Schmidt's voice, a little panicked, from the speaker. "Have you got your morning paper yet?"\n\nKiesinger peeked through the curtains at his neatly-maintained front lawn. "No, I think it's too early for that yet. What's happened?"\n\n"Speer's fucking killed our minimum wage legislation! Half our representatives in the Reichstag staged a walkout and the working class are out for blood! The Orpo's already fucking shot five people this morning!"\n\nKiesinger paused and chewed his lip. If the Orpo had turned violent that quickly, it meant that the Führer had ordered it. If the Führer had been that quick on the draw, it could have been part of his plan. "Dear God," he muttered. "What about Erhard? What's he doing?"\n\nSchmidt half-chuckled, half-sighed. "What do you think? He's gone to the Reich Chancellery to give Speer a piece of his mind. No, he didn't want to wait for us."\n\nKiesinger felt a bead of sweat drip down his temple and his neck start to prickle. "I'll head down there myself right away." The Deputy Führer hung up, wiped the sweat from his face, and dashed out of his kitchen to get dressed and prepare for the worst."

Speer reached out a hand slick with sweat to lift the receiver to his ear again. "Yes?"\n\n"My Führer," came the voice of his secretary. "Parteikanzler Kiesinger has confirmed it. The legislation passed this morning with Herr Erhard's approval, to, ah... to a full minute of applause, apparently."\n\nSpeer stared down at his desk, unresponsive. "My Führer?" came the tinny voice from the phone. "Are you still there?" Without responding, Speer dropped the receiver back into place and slumped back. A few different streams of thought ran through his mind. Had he definitely said no? Did he actually approve the proposal and just forget about it? Maybe Erhard was working to undermine him. How could he? Or maybe... maybe he wasn't. Maybe this was a good thing. But Erhard had disobeyed him. But maybe he was wrong? Maybe it was a blessing in disguise?\n\nIt took a long, long time and more than a few missed calls before any particular line of thinking won out and compelled Speer to pick up the phone once more."

Erhard asked, attempting to restrict his irritation to reasonable levels.\n\nSpeer gave him a tight stare. "Yes, Herr Erhard, I have. I've decided that the idea of a minimum wage would only serve to deprive our populace of jobs." He sounded like he was reading a script. It only made Erhard angrier. "It would also hurt the businesses that we have-"\n\n"Businesses?!" The economics minister cut in, and Speer bit his tongue, tempted to fire back but staying silent. "What businesses have come out from the ruins of the damn civil war? What do you think the purpose of the minimum wage is?! I..." Erhard groaned. "My Führer, you aren't giving me any good reasons as to why we should abolish it. I'll guess that it'd Remer and his friends who've told you some bullshit about how 'minimum wage goes against the National Socialist spirit'- what spirit? Assuring that if people work in these times they'll get money is now considered to be against the 'National Socialist spirit'?!"\n\nSpeer grit his teeth hard. Of course Erhard saw through it. He should have come up with some better excuse - an actual reason to keep the minimum wage abolished. Well, there was one. "Herr Erhard, this is a broad law that we would have to implement all over Germany. Are you expecting us to fine every single business that doesn't follow this rule to the letter?"\n\n"Yes. And as a matter of fact," Erhard puffed his cigar one last time before it became useless to him, "if you believe that the Reich isn't capable of doing such a thing, you can count me out of any of your future economic ventures. I'll take my chances elsewhere."\n\nHe really had to decide here and now, didn't he? Erhard, the bastard- Speer sometimes wondered if he was better off getting any other economic minister... and was Erhard serious about resigning, or was it merely a bluff?"

Why the fuck else did you bring me on board?" Erhard was facing down Speer, leaning on the desk with a lit cigar smoking on the carpet at his feet. Kiesinger couldn't see his face, but he could see the Führer's - and it was ruby-red.\n\n"I'm the Führer, Ludwig, and I won't tolerate this insubordination from a fucking economist! Would you have talked to Hitler like this?" Kiesinger had never seen Speer shouting before - not even when browbeating the Bormannites in the Reichstag.\n\n"It's because of Hitler that you need my help in the first place, you arrogant shithead! He threw our economy in the gutter and you helped him do it! Why can't you confine yourself to political games and architecture instead of meddling in things you can't even begin to comprehend?" Erhard's hands, gripping the sides of Speer's desk, were so white that Kiesinger thought his knuckles might burst from their flesh.\n\nSpeer still hadn't noticed Kiesinger - nor, it seemed, Schmidt and von Tresckow, who also stood just inside the doorway looking equal parts awkward and frustrated. "If you won't even heed common sense," bellowed Erhard, "Then I suppose there's no need for me in this administration!"\n\n"Resign without my permission and I'll have you shot!" Speer blurted. The room fell silent. Erhard's shaking form went completely still. Tresckow spun on his heel and stalked out. Schmidt shook his head and left as well.

tresckowgo4.3.d:0 "Tresckow did not give up. Though he felt the muscles in his face pulling at him with displeasure, he still wanted to push the Führer into reconsidering what he wanted for the army, for the people, and for the state.\n\nAnd with the way he was going for it, the rest of the cabinet joined in, much to the delight of Schörner. They began to raise their voices, to speak up more and more as Speidel finally spoke up.\n\n"Keeping this many men in our army is going to strain the capacities of our country. It will push us to the very limits of our abilities. And keeping so much under the watch of our officers now would force them to compromise the quality of training for the sake of accommodating the excess. It will mean a disaster for us in war if we have more men than our officers could lead."\n\nTresckow also added, "The country cannot continue living with this kind of system. While it is understandable that we keep an army that stands ready for the Fatherland, it is more understandable that we keep that army at its best. We must not compromise its standards. My Führer , please consider the benefits. They are worth more than an army larger than we'd want it to be."\n\nThe Führer himself listened to them, but sighed at the end of their words, simply exasperated at their continued attempts to get him to reconsider Tresckow's request."

tresckowgo4.4.d:0 "The decision was sealed. And the lowering of the draft was realized. The Führer was understandably relieved to see that he could relax after all of that had happened despite his earlier reluctance. He enjoyed his cup of coffee which he so wanted before, just as the rest of his cabinet enjoyed their victory in seeing this pass.\n\nSchmidt and Erhard both pulled out their cigarette and their cigar to quietly celebrate this victory for their partner in the Army, much to the light displeasure of the Führer. Tresckow and Speidel respectfully gave their thanks to the Führer for keeping his word. It ended in their favor, and it was only appropriate for them to give some credit to their leader, no matter how reluctant he was.\n\nOnly Schörner fumed, unwilling to stand being in the same room as those who opposed him and with a Führer who let him down. In a huff, he stormed out of the Chancellery, much to the subtle joy of those who wished to spite him.\n\nAnd when news came to the German people about the lowered draft, there was much reason for them to rejoice. Families and friends were happy to know that their sons would not have to give up a part of their lives to serve the Fatherland. Although the conservative elements of the country eventually gave their protests against this new policy, there was nothing to stop the tide of joy that swept over the people."

tresckowgo4.5.d:0 ""My Führer," von Tresckow stated, a little shocked but more insulted, "you can't simply change your mind. This is a delicate matter that concerns not only the security of the Fatherland but the state of our army. Keeping the draft as it is is going to-"\n\n"I listened to you, and I understand, but I will not have it today. I have changed my mind."\n\n"With respect, my Führer, I must protest against this."\n\n"No, von Tresckow. I've said what I said."\n\nSchörner would have smiled at this change if not from the timely intervention of Schmidt and the rest of the cabinet. Speidel too had rose up from his seat. Schörner had not noted them.\n\nThe Foreign Minister was the first to speak up. "So you're just going to shoot down what he has suggested? Just like that?" He shook his head at Speer, perplexing the man because of the way he said that.\n\nThe Führer told him, "Don't question it, Schmidt. Schörner had a point."\n\n"Indeed he has. But I don't agree. Tresckow had a better point. There's no point in wasting resources on maintaining a large army. Our country needs less force."\n\n"And our country needs more people to work with. For the sake of the economy!" Erhard joined in. Soon Kiesinger stood.\n\n"I stand with my colleagues. My Führer, you must reconsider."\n\nSpeidel nodded to this, keeping himself quiet as Tresckow spoke up once more, "My Führer, please, it must not be ignored. You must consider the benefits of lowering the draft. It will pay off much more than leaving it as it is now."\n\nSchörner bit at his lower lip and turned to Speer. The Führer looked at all of them in silent contemplation, under pressure as he realized everyone was pushing him to make a decision now. There was no way to stall them. It had to be done. Speer sighed and said..."

kiesingergo4.1.d:0 "Speer nodded approvingly as he downed the final page of the proposal. A nice fat dose of funding for education and healthcare, enough to make the Reich look like one of the most progressive nations on Earth, was sure to go over well with anyone who had half a brain. "Well, Herr Kiesinger," he said with an honest smile, "This is more like it. It's nice to have a proposal that won't anger at least half the Reichstag come to my desk."\n\nKiesinger chuckled warmly. "I'm sure, my Führer. Herr Erhard can be quite an overbearing man at times, can't he?"\n\n"Now," Speer began, steepling his fingers. "It will be quite expensive, won't it? Not that I'm opposed to it - just considering the whole picture."\n\n"Yes, my Führer, it will cost us a fair amount. I'm sure it won't be difficult to sell to the Reichstag, though. Many of the newer representatives are populists at heart, and once information about this becomes public they'll be under immense pressure to accept it."\n\nThe Führer took a moment to stew it over. The Reich's children certainly needed investment in their futures, and if the money was available to give citizens better quality healthcare, why not do it? With the military cuts and a rationalized taxation system, there really wasn't much of an argument against it. The money would just be sitting around gathering dust otherwise, waiting for some greedy bureaucrat to start picking away at it. "Very good, Parteikanzler," Speer finally said. A quick scratch of his pen, and the proposal bore the official signature of the Führer. "Deliver it with my commendation. You've truly outdone yourself, Herr Kiesinger.""

kiesingergo4.2.d:0 "Speer had no sooner snatched up his ringing phone than the voice of Reinhard Gehlen, RND chief, came blurting out of the speaker amid a burst of static. "My Führer, I must speak with you!" he barked. "This bill of Herr Kiesinger's is-"\n\nThe Führer sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling a headache coming on already. "What about it, Gehlen? Legislation isn't your business. What are you bothering me for?"\n\nGehlen sounded indignant - angry, even. "It is my business when our national security is at stake. We can't afford to have our academic base get out of hand. It's a spawning ground for Bolshevism, as I'm sure any seasoned intelligence officer could tell you. Need I remind you of the dissident groups that have already emerged from the student movement? Do you want a dozen more appearing every few months?"\n\n"Don't be so hyperbolic, Gehlen," Speer replied with a roll of his eyes. "You want to deny our youth the same education that our rivals enjoy because you're scared that it might make your job a little harder? You're going to need a better excuse than that to oppose this."\n\nThe line was silent for a moment as Gehlen composed himself. "My Führer," he said, voice smooth and inoffensive once more, "The less a man knows, the more pliable he remains. The world is a dangerous place - too dangerous for us to risk the growth of subversive academia. Bolshevism and its cohorts have always found a home amongst short-sighted young men and women. You must maintain control over our education system at all levels to secure the compliance of future generations. Think on it, my Führer."\n\n"

kiesingergo4.3.t:0 "Kiesinger's Demands - Healthcare and Education"
kiesingergo4.3.d:0 ""My Führer, think about this!" Kiesinger was closer to anger than Speer had ever seen him.\n\nStill, Speer remained impassive. "I have thought about it, Parteikanzler. Herr Gehlen made a well-reasoned case."\n\n"Well-reasoned? The man's just being paranoid! Do you think the American government worries about what their younger citizens think in private? Do you think they care? We can't stop people having subversive thoughts - if they're even having them in the first place!"\n\n"Herr Kiesinger," Speer said, taking on a conciliatory tone. "Healthcare will still receive the funding it requires. And, you know, Gehlen is right: the world is a dangerous place, and our enemies will take any opportunity to spread un-German ideas amongst the youth. Germany certainly has a history of student radicalism already, so would it really be wise to encourage that?"\n\nKiesinger looked equal parts frustrated and baffled. "Un-German ideas? My Führer, this administration is built on 'un-German' ideas, no matter what we might tell the Party. Please, don't let Gehlen dictate policy to you. His opposition to this reform is obviously based on the interests of the RND, not the Reich as a whole."\n\nSpeer twiddled his thumbs beneath the desk. It did seem pointlessly obstructionist, but Gehlen had been forthcoming so far. Would he really act against the Reich's best interests? Would he really do that - just go to the Führer's office and tell lies?"
kiesingergo4.3.a:0 "Kiesinger's right, of course."

kiesingergo4.4.d:0 ""My Führer?"\n\nSpeer glanced up from his paperwork, a little surprised. It was unusual for his secretary to say anything more than strictly necessary to him. "Yes, Friedman?"\n\nThe young man looked awkward for a moment, as though he'd forgotten how to speak. His mouth opened and closed like a fish a few times before the words came spilling out. "My Führer, I just wanted to say thank you."\n\n"Oh," Speer smiled and went back to revising his newest speech. "Really, you needn't. You were overdue for a pay rise anyway."\n\n"It's not that, my Führer." Speer looked up again, puzzled. "I mean, this new legislation of yours the Reichstag just passed - it means a lot to me and... uh, to a lot of people I know, and people like me who grew up after the war. My wife can take up her degree again, and my mother doesn't have to choose between medicine and three square meals a day. So, um... thank you, my Führer."\n\nThe two men, separated by generations and, unbeknownst to Friedman, their politics, were silent for a moment. Then, Speer smiled again - sincerely, this time. "I'm glad to hear it. Making a difference to people like you was precisely the intention." Picking up his pen, Speer resumed his work, but not without one final smile and nod of approval at Friedman as he headed back to his desk with a little less weight on his heart."
kiesingergo4.4.a:0 "It's nice to be appreciated."

kiesingergo4.5.t:0 "Kiesinger's Demands - Healthcare and Education"
kiesingergo4.5.d:0 "Speer looked weary as he shuffled through one report after another. Feedback from the Reichstag had not been positive - there was near-universal dissatisfaction with the removal of education from the funding package. He'd never expected to see the day when the reformers and Bormannites would agree on anything, but here it was.\n\n"Letter from Herr Gehlen, my Führer," said Friedman, his secretary, placing a pair of sealed envelopes on the desk. "And another from the Parteikanzler. That's all, my Führer."\n\nSpeer regarded Friedman with a suspicious eye as he headed out the door. The boy had been so empty-eyed and listless recently, even with his pay increase. Perhaps it was time to find someone more personable to greet visitors. For now, however, he had a pile of letters to get through.\n\nNone were positive, save Gehlen's. Naturally, the RND head was overjoyed to know that the youth wouldn't have a chance to get any funny ideas, nor to be educated above their stations without a substantial amount of family wealth behind them. Speer couldn't even bear to read Kiesinger's - criticism from his inner circle only fostered greater stress. Still, this wasn't a complete setback for reformism, so how could anyone truly fault him for his decision? Surely education would have another chance for reform further down the line, once national security was less of a concern."

 kiesingergo4.6.desc:0 "Kurt Georg Kiesinger managed to find Albert Speer at just the right mood, it seemed. Almost pliable, he was hoping. Nonetheless, he entered the Führer's office and met with the man eye-to-eye. Raising an eyebrow, Speer began speaking. "Herr Kiesinger?" He asked. "My Führer," Kiesinger began, "There's something that needs to be tended to. It is an issue we've left unsolved for far too long, and I believe that today is the day where we can decide on what to do with it." Speer tensed up, if only slightly. What was the man planning? "Go on, Herr Kiesinger. What is this issue that you want solved?"\n\nHe nodded politely. "It is the matter of our religious policy." Speer felt the fingers on his pen press just a bit harder. "Yes, what of it?" He asked. "My Führer, as it stands right now, the Reich maintains Hitler's anti-religious laws. But, over the past few decades, the demographics of what our people believe in has not shifted too drastically. A significant portion are still practicing Protestants and Catholics, and-", "Are you, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer started, "asking me to reverse this change? Do you not remember what our previous Führer's wishes were?" Kiesinger simply nodded again, which irritated Speer even more. "Of course I know, my Führer. But you also realize that you have promised us reform? We've been the backbone of your operations quite a while now, and nobody would find it satisfactory if..."\n\n"This again," Speer nearly hissed. "I'm being strong-armed into accepting your damn proposal. And if I refuse?" Kiesinger now shook his head. "I don't know exactly what would happen if you did, my Führer, but you have only to gain by following through with this policy. You will bring stability into the Reich, and those who have been oppressed will be happier to serve. Not only that, it will weaken the grip that the hardliners wish to hold against us." Speer glared at him for a while. He was making good points, that was true, but was he about to go back on his word? The consequences if he did so...\n\nAfter a while of unpleasant silence, Speer's gaze lowered back down to the papers in front of him. "Herr Kiesinger...""

He said, and the man looked at Kiesinger with a mixture of impatience and boredom, less so gratitude and accepting of the flattery. "Whatever troubles befall your office, I am certain I can solve."\n\nSpeer leaned forward on his desk and put his hands together. "Herr Kiesinger, be well aware that much of the NSDAP will not be happy about this. The much unnecessary pressure will be far from helpful during this time. I hope you can keep them at bay." Kiesinger nodded politely.\n\n"Will that be all you require of me, my Führer?" He asked, and Speer looked to be actually thinking about the prospect for a few seconds, before merely shaking his head and speaking.\n\n"No, Herr Kiesinger. You are dismissed." When the Deputy Führer left the room, it entered into a stale, unpleasant silence. There were many names off the top of his head that he could name who would not appreciate this move. He merely crossed his fingers there wouldn't be too many wanting to voice their opinions."

 kiesingergo4.8.t:0 "Not So Fast"
 kiesingergo4.8.desc:0 "The morning was tiring. Having agreed to Kiesinger's request, Speer had to deal with the endless paperwork that would haunt him for months. Had it been only that, then his only concern would be the frustration of having to give up yet another one of his ambitions. But in a twist of fate that only served to make him even further annoyed, he had received letter after letter of high-ranking officials in the government, demanding that this be reversed. Though one in specific stood out - a letter with a particularly prestigious seal.\n\n"My Führer, I have heard about a deeply concerning change of pace within the upper echelons of the Volkshalle. Is this true? Are we stepping away from the building blocks that our previous Führer, Adolf Hitler, set for us? I, along with my allies and friends within the circles of the Reich, find ourselves worried that the integrity of National Socialist values will be threatened. Did we not talk about the futility of religion? Its needless superstition, and an insatiable desire to twist the present back towards the past? Not only that, but it is directly linked to the Jew. I will not speak of the attempts to synthesize our ideology and Christianity together, for it is an abomination, but rather I will speak of what secularization will lead to.\n\nWe have, thankfully, annihilated Judaism from Europa, but unfortunately, the claws of Abraham still follow us. I know that you, my Führer, have no love for Christ and his Jewry. And so I ask you to please reconsider what has been done. If you truly let our Reich slip into tolerating the Protestant and the Christian, then we will once again allow ourselves to be tainted by a religious ideology contrary to National Socialism, contrary to the thousand year Reich that we are to build, and contrary to our supremacy as an Aryan people. It is my hope that, when you receive this letter, you will quickly realize what decision to make.\n\nThe future of Germany is in your hands, my Führer, and I trust that you will make the right choice. - Reichsstatthalter Arthur Greiser of Wartheland."\n\nBy the end of it, Speer was gritting his teeth, wondering what the hell to do."

What was Kiesinger's previously boisterous and proud attitude crashed and burned like a zeppelin, and Kiesinger merely receded into silence. The seconds that passed were one of the most uncomfortable ones Speer felt in his entire life, and, daring not to move his eyes off of the Prussian, spot Kiesinger out from the corner of his eye, backing away, then moving behind Tresckow.\n\nThe man didn't even ask for permission to leave. Speer would have felt slighted for that, but by the circumstances right now, he wouldn't have bothered raising such protests. When the doorknob clicked open the door, Tresckow didn't move a muscle. When it closed behind him, Speer could feel sweat forming on his brow."

 kiesingergo4.9.t:0 "A Time Like Any Other"
 kiesingergo4.9.desc:0 "It was only a day later, in the afternoon, when Speer heard those familiar footsteps outside his door. Putting his papers away, he knew that the man who was about to come in would force Speer to pay full attention to him, in no small part due to his nature. With a small cough and clearing of his throat, the Führer rested his face and put his hands together in waiting. With a sharp but careful swing of the door, Tresckow stepped in, closing it behind him as he gave a crisp salute. "Herr Speer!" He began, almost as if he was the Führer. "I have heard of the situation developing."\n\n"Really, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, raising an eyebrow at the Prussian. "As you know, Herr Speer," he began, body language loosening just slightly. "I am a man who sees clearly into the past, and all of the good that it has served us. Though I strive for what unified our nation - Prussian discipline, mettle, and spirit, there's another element limiting Germany from reaching its full potential!" Speer slid a hand up to the side of his face. "Go on, Herr Tresckow..." He weakly encouraged.\n\nHe nodded dutifully. "The essence of God has been restricted, Herr Speer." The military man sighed. "In my own homeland, I see Protestants thrown out of churches for only doing their duty. Elsewhere, Catholics are harassed and their sermons broken up by police." Tresckow stated, eyes narrowing just a little bit. He could recognize that look Speer was giving him. "You may not care much about it, but many of Germany's citizens do. The direction you're taking shall be antithetical to their beliefs. If you want to avoid decades of strife, then I suggest pressing through with allowing people to worship openly."\n\nSpeer glanced at him inquisitively. He offered no sympathy to religion, and would be happy to see it gone, but was it really worth backing down? The choice, then, was between upholding the future of a Germany free of religion, or guaranteeing stability by allowing them to practice their faith."
 kiesingergo4.9.a:0 "Alright, Herr Tresckow. I won't bother with this further. I hope I don't regret this."

It felt like he was pinning himself up as a target for the police - and, truth be told, the close encounters he had with them told him that the Protestant was lucky to not be in jail yet. Exiting into the streets, the nicely-painted black letters against white said "GERMANY WITHOUT FAITH - GERMANY WITHOUT ITS SOUL!". He could see, in the far distance, the ominous and foreboding Volkshalle staring down at him as he gathered with his friends.\n\nAn hour and a half later, Josef rallied at the front, next to another ally of his who waved a flag around that spoke of a similar message. She was bolder, older than him - a veteran of these things, and he could always learn something new from her. But when they turned the street corner and met upon a patrol of military police, both parties stood dead in their tracks. Here, in Welthauptstadt Germania, was a small protest of ten marching about and wanting their freedom to ring true, and nobody was quite sure of what to do.\n\nThat was, until one of the policemen started cracking up. Nudging a fellow officer of his, they took a few minutes to find a megaphone, and with a click, they spoke. "The police is here to remind you all that Führer Speer has begun secularizing the anti-religious policies that have been currently instated." The tension between the two groups loosened significantly after that. "However, that still doesn't mean you can walk around and disrupt citizens. Go home and wait, unless you want to be punished." The casual tone of his voice slightly unnerved Josed, and he swallowed. There wasn't even a 'that is all', instead only the cutting of static as the policemen moved on."

Every day, Nils locked eyes with that building, closed down, all the light of its life having left it so long ago. Every year, Nils hoped that something would change. That he would no longer have to do service to the Lord within the confines of his own home, always in danger of being watched by those that would want to stamp his faith out in these dark times. It had been so long, in fact, that only Nils remained to be the only one in his family who didn't just pay lip service to something that guided him for a lifetime. Even when he was told by his mother to stop fretting so much about prayer, and worry more about what would happen if he was caught, he did not relent. And for just a day, it seemed like his faith had proved its mettle, and its dedication.\n\nOne day, Nils had woken up to something different. The church was no longer dreadfully empty of souls. Instead, the lights had been turned on, and he could see his fellow Germans moving about. He took a care to not rush himself in excitement, however, as modesty remained an important concern. Yet... eventually, when he walked into that simple building, and met that familiar face of the preacher greeting him with a warmth that he lacked somehow back home, Nils felt at peace with himself. He heard it from one of his brothers that the government decreed a slow reversing of policy that would discriminate against the religious, and that made him both happy and shocked. What made them do such a thing? Perhaps someone had a change of heart. Whatever it was, he only hoped that it would remain that way.\n\nUntil it didn't. The next day afterwards, Nils nigh jumped out of his bed to see what state the church was in, and a low, sinking feeling overcame his stomach with what he saw. As if yesterday never happened, he saw soldiers guarding the front of the building, with people being ferried out, one by one. Perhaps they didn't have a change of heart at all, and it was all a charade - making a mockery of something they had already begun ruining. He found anger at the thought, and that anger did not abate when the hours passed. His family could see it, and his mother warned him to not be consumed by fury, but he knew better. Hours later, when Nils heard chanting from outside his house, he knew what to do. With a cross in one hand and a sturdy piece of wood concealed on his person, he went out to see a wave of people filling the street of the church, facing off against a squadron of military police."

Taking a deep breath, the disciplined Prussian stood firm. "Herr Speer." He began, voice cold and direct. "Do you realize what you are saying?" The Führer stared at him almost blankly, but nodded. "Yes, Herr Tresckow, I have said what I had on my mind. And?" If looks could hurt, then Tresckow's would be a wunderwaffe. "And? Herr Speer... I don't wish to cause a ruckus in your office, but you are causing a grave error as of this moment. I understand that you do not care about religion," and he was tempted to add 'instead you follow your own damnable devil', but relented. "I, however, put value on it. A value so high that, if I am still around to see it tarnished and ruined," he began, some frustration now clearly rising above the surface, "Stomped out in front of me, then, Herr Speer, I believe that my presence will no longer be necessary here."\n\nSpeer nearly flinched at the comment. Did Tresckow just imply a resignation? He balled a hand up into a fist and put it on the desk. "I... am I hearing you right, Herr Tresckow?" Speer asked, sounding taken aback. "You wouldn't do this. Not over something like this." The moment after he said that, the Prussian made a noise that sounded close to a hiss. "Of course I would!" He spoke, raising his voice that mixed anger and irritation together. "I cannot bother with being subtle about it, Herr Speer. If you want to snuff the light of religion in this country, then I shall not be here to see it, rest assured!" Speer glared at him. He couldn't tell if Tresckow would truly follow up on it, but he felt strongly like he would. "This... ridiculous dialogue of yours, is something I refuse to tolerate!" It felt like Speer's heart skipped a beat. Now a slow trickle of panic began filling his mind as Tresckow got more and more openly angry. "Herr Speer, you can consider my participation in this charade over!"\n\nAs Tresckow began turning around, he only had moments to think. He had to say something, because saying nothing would only serve to humiliate him. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Speer caught the Prussian's attention by saying..."

"... Have you changed your mind?" The military man asked. Speer swallowed back doubt and reluctantly spoke. "Herr Tresckow, I... we can speak of this further. It doesn't have to end here." He could sense the other man's stance tightening, and then, after a few terse seconds, he looked down at the floor.\n\n"Herr Speer..." He began. "I'll hear you out." Yet he didn't bother to turn around. A part of Speer wanted to face him head-on, but another was glad that wasn't the case. "However, I believe I need... something." That didn't sound like good news. "Something?" Speer asked, and Tresckow nodded. "Yes. It is something I believe will resolve this situation amicably. In a way that, at least I will find satisfactory." No. It absolutely did not sound like good news - not at all. "Then," Speer began, sighing and rubbing his forehead. "Go and acquire this 'something' of yours. I don't-- we don't have all day."\n\nAgain, Tresckow nodded. Quick and professionally. "Certainly, Herr Speer. I bid you goodbye and will return to you in just a short while."

He was expecting Tresckow again, for sure, but what he saw not only surprised him, but shocked him.\n\nFirst came Tresckow. Then came another three - all faces he distinctly, immediately recognized. Helmut Schmidt, Kurt Georg Kiesinger, and Ludwig Erhardt. Three extra personalities he did not want to meet today. Though he wanted to sink back in his seat, he sat firmly, and eyed them all with a strong gaze. "So this is your something." He stated, giving the fiercest gaze to Tresckow, who looked back at him and betrayed no emotion. "Gentlemen?" Tresckow said, turning to the other three, and they all nodded.\n\n"I'll speak on behalf of all four of us," Kiesinger said, nodding towards Speer, who looked at him warily. "You're making a most unwise choice, my Führer. Herr Tresckow is firmly dedicated to Germany's long-valued Christian beliefs. To get rid of them now, well..." He shook his head. "I believe you're missing the point of this alliance.\n\nSpeer felt his pointer finger press hard on the wooden surface of his table. He was cornered. Like a caged animal, he was at his wits end. He could deal with Tresckow on his own, but this? "My Führer?" Kiesinger asked, snapping Speer out of his dazed state and forcing his focus back on the four. "We need a choice from you, and I will make you well aware that this mutual pact of ours does not only go one way." Speer could swear, out from the corner of his eye, that he could feel disciplined eyes trained on every fidget of his hands and muscle on his face - but something must be said. A decision had to come to fruition, else what masqueraded as a simple demand would unravel into something much worse. "
 kiesingergo4.14.a:0 "Of course I will listen. We can break this standstill."
 kiesingergo4.14.b:0 "I... I assert my authority! "

 kiesingergo4.15.t:0 "What Else, Really? "
 kiesingergo4.15.desc:0 "The five dispersed shortly afterwards that day, and they all had let out a collective sigh of relief. Except Speer. Backed into an ultimatum, now he further vested power into the damnable Gang, and he had nothing to show for it. No ulterior motives, no long-term plans, no shadows in the dark - and now, his pride would be turned against him, being forced to sit in his office and sign legislation after legislation about legalizing church practices and private worship. Not only that, but he had to deal with the bloody NSDAP.\n\nOr, at least, he would have. The next time Speer met Kiesinger, the air between them wasn't the happiest, but he was told that the most stringent of responses would be avoided and minimized to his office. He had helped the Gang, and so the Gang would help him. Not only that, in but a few days he had already received letters from Christians coming from all parts of Germany, thanking him for beginning the process of reversing decades of discrimination. Some were less grateful than others, but Speer felt bitter all the same. He never planned to secularize, but outside forces forced his hand, and, to further humiliate him, made it so that he looked like the man behind the job."
 kiesingergo4.15.a:0 "Another vision to give up."

 kiesingergo4.16.t:0 "Moment Of Prescience"
 kiesingergo4.16.desc:0 "When the words left his mouth, he froze. Regret immediately came to him, and as his eyes shifted towards where Tresckow would be, all he was met with was the slam of the door closing behind an incredibly irate Prussian. The rest stared at him, a mixture of frustrated and purely dumbfounded. Erhard looked disgusted. Schmidt seemed irritated, and Kiesinger was disappointed, merely sighing and shaking his head. "A grave mistake, my Führer. I truly hoped it wouldn't come to this."\n\n"What do you mean?" Speer asked through gritted teeth. "You're not telling me he's-", "Resigning?" Kiesinger finished, and his expression dropped further. The air in the room continued to still. "By tomorrow, I am afraid."\n\nAs Speer struggled to recompose himself, Erhard drew in his cigar and puffed out some smoke, giving Speer a nasty glare. "I'll think on what happens next. The rest of you two can stay here and do whatever, but I'm leaving." As he did, Schmidt spoke up soon afterwards. "Actually... I believe I will go too. This has given me food for thought, and, well..." He nodded towards Speer, who looked lost for words. "Goodbye, my Führer."\n\nIt was only Kiesinger left standing, and he could read Speer like a book. "No point in you staying here," Speer almost snarled. "Go. Leave. You must have business to attend to, I'm sure." He was losing strength and energy to speak with every passing word, but Kiesinger merely nodded. "Of course I do, my Führer. Goodbye.""
 kiesingergo4.16.a:0 "Speer didn't get anything done that day."

 kiesingergo4.17.t:0 "Have Some Courtesy"
 kiesingergo4.17.desc:0 "Speer dreaded going to his office that morning. So much so that it took him almost half an hour extra before he exited his house, and he barely paid attention to whatever his chauffeur wanted to talk about. He wanted - no, he needed something to prevent him from going to do his job. Just for that day. Just so that he could have time off. There was nothing, however. There was no terrorist threat. There was no assassination attempt. Instead, the Führer simply crossed the streets of Germania, safe and sound as many other citizens of the Reich.\n\nWhen he came to his door, his hand grasped at the doorknob for much longer than he needed to. When he pushed it down, it felt like he had to use all the strength in his body to do so. When he walked in, his eyes looked at everything. The windows, the outside. The decorating, the cabinets. The papers.\n\nThe letters. He could spot their signatures from even where he was standing. Tremors began to slowly wrack up his torso and spread to his limbs as he counted them. Not even a last goodbye. Like snakes, they shed their skins and left. When his hand touched upon the surface of one letter, - Tresckow's, of course it stood at the top - a pang of guilt passed by his heart. In this Reich, however, one could not feel guilt. One could only move forward. Speer considered reading the letters; something useful to extract, perhaps. Then he realized that nothing about it was important. Not anymore.\n\nAnd so they were thrown into the trash. Unopened, unread. Left to wilt into nothingness. Words written would remain words unsaid, but they burned into Speer's mind."
 kiesingergo4.17.a:0 "Then there was one."

 kiesingergo4.18.t:0 "An Alliance In Tatters"
 kiesingergo4.18.desc:0 "Speer pretended he was alright. He pretended that he had eaten three meals today. He pretended that he drank enough water appropriate for a man of his age. He pretended Germany was fine. He pretended that there was no migraine crawling up the back of his skull, and how he hadn't stopped shaking for most of the day, and how his mind wasn't a flash of thought patterns that resembled nothing coherent.\n\nSpeer wanted to pretend he was alright. But nothing was. Not after the empire of his dreams crumbled before his eyes, and from the rubble he picked and pulled his hands into, all that remained was the torn-up flag of the Reich. The tilted swastika staring back at him. He would have welcomed it, but now all that was left was its corrupted form, hollow and distorted. Since the Gang left, Speer came to a cold, cruel realization - one he knew from the start, but refused to acknowledge. It faced him here, in his study room, locked inside his own home, his mind swimming in a pool of painful memories and even more painful truths.\n\nThere was only one thing left for him. Only one avenue of support. A force that would corrupt him, too. But it was better him than anyone else. Even with his vision broken, he had a glimmer of hope that he could steer the wheel and prevent it from turning all the way. No longer could he think of a bright Germany.\n\nOnly one shrouded in darkness, the grip of the NSDAP slowly crushing the flickering light of true National Socialism. Now, he would stray down the path of insanity that would border him on all sides. He could only hope that he was not consumed by it."
 kiesingergo4.18.a:0 "There is nothing to do but serve. And serve I shall."

 kiesingergo4.19.t:0 "Hope You Guessed My Name"
 kiesingergo4.19.desc:0 "He felt glued to his chair. In fact, Speer felt like he was trapped in his office. Is this what claustrophobia felt like? Except the walls were too wide, the windows too open. His ears perked up to the sounds of cars passing by the street outside, and the wind blowing through the air. His eyes failed - perhaps purposefully - to notice the stack of papers on his desk. He didn't give them a look. Recently, he had developed a hate of letters. If someone asked him why, he would simply shrug, and tell them that he didn't really know why.\n\nHe would have been content with sitting there, doing nothing, for hours on end, until he got the opportunity to go home and do more of nothing. But silence never lasted long. At some point during the day, some hours in the afternoon, the phone in his office rang. The noise was shrill and piercing for his ears, but it alerted him quickly, and in a haze of sudden anger and irritation he grabbed it roughly and put it up against his ear. "Who is this?" He demanded.\n\n"Hmm. You should recognize me by voice alone," the other voice on the line spoke, and Speer could feel his anger receding instantly. "I am Theodor Oberländer. Quite... the important figure in the NSDAP. I believe I can make my services of use to you."\n\nThere were no protests. Ever since the Gang left, the reformist clique in the NSDAP would begin their eventual collapse. Only the reactionaries were left. The visionaries who twisted National Socialism and dragged it through mud and blood, and Speer could only slow it down. "I've recently come to the knowledge that your cabinet has resigned. A true shame." Nothing betrayed Oberländer's voice. "Not to worry. The NSDAP has always been a strong force, and since I am at the helm of the ones who used to oppose you, well... stability will come easy. Rest assured, this will be a fruitful venture. Now... I needn't waste more of your time, though I will tell you one thing." Speer gripped the phone in his hand tightly, and a part of him wanted to smash it against his desk. "Regardless of how you were as Führer before...""
 kiesingergo4.19.a:0 ""You shall be an excellent Führer now.""

 kiesingergo4.20.t:0 "Resolving The Stand-Off"
 kiesingergo4.20.desc:0 ""That would be too risky of a development," Speer said, waving off Kiesinger. "I already have the hardliners breathing down my neck. If we were to propose this secularization, they may just take the opportunity to corner our influence." Kiesinger breathed irritation and exhaled calm. Of course Speer would try to downplay the idea. That should have come as no surprise, but he was expecting less resistance than a hard no. Still, it wasn't a catastrophe.\n\nKiesinger nodded politely. "Of course, my Führer. While I would drop the topic..." Speer had a feeling there wasn't an end to this yet. "There is more that remains unaddressed. In fact, I believe I may bring you something to settle your doubts once and for all." Speer raised an eyebrow. "Something?" He asked. "Do you mean, perhaps, to bring me answers?" Kiesinger once again nodded. "If you may, my Führer - I shall leave, and return soon with answers in tow."\n\nSpeer looked at him with suspicion, but held his tongue on the more unsavoury things he wanted to say. Instead, he let out a short sigh. "You are dismissed, Herr Kiesinger. And do not take too long. I've not all day." As Kiesinger thanked the man and left the room, Speer was left to his thoughts."
 kiesingergo4.20.a:0 "What is Kiesinger's game?"

 kiesingergo4.27.t:0 "The Curtain Opens"
 kiesingergo4.27.desc:0 "When Speer heard two pairs of footsteps outside his door, one was calm and normal. The other, he realized, moments before the door swung open, was von Tresckow.\n\nKiesinger merely gave Speer a friendly glance as Tresckow nigh stomped inside into his office. He gave a crisp, though annoyed salute, and spoke. "Herr Speer!" He said, demanding the fading attention of the Führer. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger?" He asked in return, and the Prussian straightened himself up. "I will make this brief, but the message shall surely resound with you. Herr Speer, do you remember one of the primary goals of our alliance?" Speer nodded. "I remember all of them. What are you referring to, exactly?" He asked, shifting somewhat uncomfortably in his seat.\n\nTresckow harrumphed. "Freedom!" He exclaimed. "The freedom of Germany's people. Is that not one of the main things we've been promised? I would say that it is one of the tenets crafted into the political web we've created for each other!" Speer felt his energy draining after each and every word Tresckow spoke. "And what is the most prized freedom of them all, than the freedom of worship?" His gaze affixed on Speer's eyes, and the Führer could not dare to look away from him.\n\n"My Führer." Kiesinger said. "I believe Herr Tresckow will remain unsullied by the reply of silence. I advise..." He looked at Tresckow, who seemed intent to keep staring at Speer. "... for you to answer him." Then he looked back at Speer, who seemed deep in thought, though not for reasons the Prussian would hope for. The room remained silent for a few seconds more, but after long enough, Speer broke the silence. He was to determine the mood shift with what he said, and there were two lines of thought he could pursue."
 kiesingergo4.27.a:0 "The NSDAP is dangerous."
 kiesingergo4.27.b:0 "We cannot tarnish National Socialism's values any further."

 kiesingergo4.21.t:0 "To Reveal Fright"
 kiesingergo4.21.desc:0 ""The..." Speer sighed. "The NSDAP is a dangerous force, Herr Tresckow." The Prussian felt like he wanted to roll his eyes. What a silly, generic response. But it prevented another outburst from the man. Speer noted Tresckow's pose slightly relaxing, and he felt the smallest weight come off his shoulders. Kiesinger, however, looked fully unconvinced, yet let the man speak.\n\n"There is a significant amount of them that still oppose us at every turn!" He noted. "If we did something as extreme as this, they would jump at the opportunity to decry us as radicals. They could raise hell in the Reichstag, and... impede us at every point they could! It's simply something I find difficult to convince the hardliners on." As the two listened on, Speer's spiel seemed to have the opposite effect on their opinion - especially Kiesinger, who merely shook his head and sighed."
 kiesingergo4.21.a:0 ""Let me make a counter-point...""

 kiesingergo4.22.t:0 "The Curtain Begins Closing"
 kiesingergo4.22.desc:0 ""Go on, Herr Kiesinger..." Speer trailed off, feeling frustrated that he couldn't give much of a good argument in his favor.\n\nKiesinger nodded. "You speak of the consequences, but that is exactly why you should go through with this decision, my Führer. To the people, you are their leader." He stated the obvious, but Speer had a feeling that wasn't just it. "To the party, however..." Speer's eyes tightened just enough for Kiesinger to notice. And ignore, as his smile widened the slightest bit. "Well, you are no dictator. You do not make every rule and judgement."\n\n"So you are to take the fall?" Speer asked, and Kiesinger shook his head once again. "No, no. Better than that. I am not Deputy Führer for no reason. I will manage whatever the more unsavory part of the NSDAP shall unleash on us. I merely ask that you let this reform pass. Whatever happens, it shall be under my jurisdiction to take care of."\n\nSpeer pressed his palms against each other harder than normal. Again, Tresckow and Kiesinger fell into silence as the Führer thought, and they thought it better to let him think. And think he did. After almost a full ten seconds, Speer exhaled deeply and spoke."
 kiesingergo4.22.a:0 "This will be your problem now. Not mine."
 kiesingergo4.22.b:0 "I'm afraid, Herr Kiesinger, that it is too much of a risk."

 kiesingergo4.23.t:0 "The Curtain Falls"
 kiesingergo4.23.desc:0 "Kiesinger stared at Speer like a Nazi would at a Bolshevik. Yet, at the same time, it was subdued. Fading so quickly that Speer only caught a glimpse of the anger Kiesinger felt before it either vanished or remained, hidden behind Kiesinger's veil. Tresckow, meanwhile, looked almost stunned. "I have said what I have said, Herr Kiesinger. Do not expect me to relent on this decision."\n\nKiesinger exchanged a glance at Tresckow, who seemed stuck in thought. Then he coughed uncomfortably, and looked towards Speer, fixing up the tie on his suit. "If that's the case, then I needn't be here any longer. Am I dismissed, my Führer?" Speer eyed the Prussian with a sense of worry and confusion. He barely overheard Kiesinger's words, but gave a half-nod. "Yes, Herr Kiesinger... you are dismissed."\n\nAs the Deputy Führer left the room, he gave his last parting words as the Prussian seemed to regain his clarity."
 kiesingergo4.23.a:0 "It seems like Herr Tresckow is not done. Good luck, my Führer."

 kiesingergo4.24.t:0 "To Reveal An Inkling Of Madness"
 kiesingergo4.24.desc:0 "He didn't feel sure about this. But maybe- maybe it would work. "Well..." Speer began, as the two stared at him with a modicum of surprise. "You've heard me. Have the two of you forgotten what our Germany was built on?" He continued, feeling the ember of spirit embed itself in his voice, just a notch above the desperation he felt moments before. "It was the ideology that had the world in its grasp for decades!"\n\nHe could feel the disappointment emanating from them. Maybe he just struck the wrong chord? "The only reason why we are declining now is because we're moving past our roots! What made us strong! Germany needs its previous faith no more!" At that, Tresckow visibly began getting upset. Kiesinger, meanwhile, fell into neutrality - not a hint of emotion betraying his face.\n\n"And..." Speer continued, taking a moment to process and discard his regret. "To go back to the time where we were great, we cannot capitulate to these new ideas that want to drag us into the past!" When he stopped, he could only hesitantly look at Tresckow, who was positively brewing. Speer wanted to say something, but the Prussian fired the first shot."
 kiesingergo4.24.a:0 ""Herr. Speer.""

 kiesingergo4.25.t:0 "Purity Of Sin"
 kiesingergo4.25.desc:0 "It was like a ghost spoke to Speer. He froze still, and in a way, so did Kiesinger.\n\n"I am not a stupid man, Herr Speer." Tresckow said, glaring at Führer with enough strength to make the man feel like he was facing down a member of the SS. "Perhaps you take me as silly. Naïve, even. But that would be far from the truth." His sigh approached a growl, and Speer felt his throat going dry. "The past, Herr Speer? Really, now? The past that has shaped our entire culture from birth to present?! I have tolerated this insofar as having the idea that you would listen to Herr Kiesinger, as he speaks with reason, but I am mistaken."\n\nSpeer's eyes flicked back and forth between the two, but he dared not interrupt the Prussian. "Do you think these men and women some... some bandits?" He asked. "Some bomb-throwing anarchists? If so, I am shocked Germany is not up in flames from these Christians." Kiesinger shook his head. "No. The truth is much simpler. These are people - my people! They wish to be left in peace. To pray to their sole creator, and follow the path the Lord has given them!"\n\n"So, Herr Speer?" He asked, tightening a fist and quietly gritting his teeth towards the Führer. "Will you go against the will of the majority? They only wish for peace. Nothing more. And I would advise listening to the people's will. After all..." Tresckow's eyes narrowed. "That has always been the job of the Führer."\n\nKiesinger remained deathly quiet. Speer, meanwhile, felt like he faced down the barrel of a gun. Whatever he said, he had to mean it. So eventually, Speer regained his composure, and mustered a reply. "
 kiesingergo4.25.a:0 "Perhaps your points are sound, Herr Kiesinger."
 kiesingergo4.25.b:0 "These values... they... they mean nothing to me!"

 kiesingergo4.26.t:0 "Of Weak Resolve"
 kiesingergo4.26.desc:0 "Immediately, Tresckow loosened his body language. Then, Kiesinger broke out into a sigh he didn't know he was holding. Speer, meanwhile, wasn't done yet. Clearly sounding unsatisfied, he spoke like a man being forced to speak under threat od torture. "I do not want to see a single paper pertaining to any important member in the NSDAP. Do you understand, Herr Kiesinger?" He pointedly asked, and the man regained his focus to meet his gaze at him.\n\n"Of course I do, my Führer. I will try my best to cow the hardliners. Otherwise..." He looked towards Tresckow. "It seems to me like you're satisfied." When the Prussian was addressed, he straightened his back and stiffened his body once again. "Why wouldn't I? Today is a great day for Germany's people!" He exclaimed, then sighed. "This means I must have business to attend to." He said, and Speer gave him the slightest look of suspicion that he merely ignored. "Herr Speer," he addressed, prompting the Führer to listen closely. "Are we dismissed?"\n\nFeeling content in the fact that this was at least finally resolved - though far from being in his favor - he nodded."
 kiesingergo4.26.a:0 "The rest of the day went by, as monotonous as any other."

 kiesingergo4.29.t:0 "Down To Ground Level"
 kiesingergo4.29.desc:0 ""... That is to say, points different from what you would want me to agree on." Speer continued, and Tresckow began seizing on hostility in his eyes before suddenly realizing what the man meant, giving the Führer a small scare as the Prussian calmed down. Kiesinger, meanwhile, rubbed his forehead and grit his teeth for a second or two before speaking. "What, ah... what were these points you agreed on, my Führer?"\n\nSpeer almost audibly grumbled when asked to clarify. "Primarily one. It's the fact that, yes, I did promise some form of liberalization to Germany." He well and truly hated that word, but couldn't dodge saying it. "I suppose that... secularizing the country can fall under one of those freedoms." At that, Tresckow seemed to undergo some sort of mood swing, now standing properly and his gaze significantly softening to something more reasonable.\n\n"Ha-ha! I'm glad you see light to reason, Herr Speer!" He said, only prompting the Führer to feel more defeated - he wouldn't bother countering that. Tresckow nodded towards Kiesinger. "This calls for a celebration, doesn't it?" Kiesinger gave a somewhat meek nod, which Tresckow merely chuckled at. "Alright, well, I may at least celebrate this victory in private." Turning towards Speer, he continued. "Now, are we to be dismissed?" He was merely received with a sigh and a hand wave, gesturing for the two of them to leave his office.\n\nWith a sharp nod from Tresckow and a courteous one from Kiesinger, they left Speer to his thoughts."
 kiesingergo4.29.a:0 "Another battle lost."
