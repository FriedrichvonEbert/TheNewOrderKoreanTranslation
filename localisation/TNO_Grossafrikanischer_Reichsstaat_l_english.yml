 POLITICS_OTTO_FORSCHNER_DESC:0 "Otto Förschner will spend the rest of his life in Africa, but how pleasant his stay is will depend largely on what he does next.\n\nAfter going along with the late Statthalter's insanity throughout the duration of his regime, the Kolonialverwalter of Kongo was convinced by other erstwhile Hüttig loyalists of the need to eliminate him in order to save his own skin. While the plan succeeded, it also deprived the Reichsstaat of the element that held it together: Fear of Hüttig. Therefore, the once mighty German Africa was quickly reduced to a rump state, desperately clinging on to Leopoldville.\n\nCharged with the responsibility of leading the remnants of the Reichsstaat's administrative core into living another day, Förschner must first deal with the unworkable mess of a state he has been left with. Given that he has no hope of ever returning to Germany, his only chance for survival is to reconstruct the institutions that once propped up Siegfried Müller's Zentralafrika regime, and use them to strengthen himself against the inevitable attack from the west. Luckily for him, the Congo has descended into total chaos, which buys the Afrikaner Abwehrfront some much needed time."
 POLITICS_KAI_UWE_VON_HASSEL_DESC:0 "Born in German East Africa during the First World War, Kai-Uwe von Hassel returned to his native continent in the aftermath of Germany's victory in the second. A respected administrator in Zentralafrika, von Hassel was invited to take part in Hans Hüttig's imminent takeover of the colony by Rolf Steiner. Having no choice, he pretended to go along with the plan, but secretly led an organization which sought to overthrow the Statthalter and restore German rule.\n\nWith Germany's heavy investment in the South African War having earned the loyalty of many in the bureaucracy, von Hassel was able to undermine Hüttig's regime, hastening its fall, and saving the Cape from his grasp. Moreover, he was able to betray Otto Förschner, with whom he had temporarily allied himself with, after the latter killed Hüttig.\n\nWhile the Statthalter's death proved the final blow for German rule over the continent at large, von Hassel managed to secure the mouth of the Congo river for the Reich. With a grateful Führer appointing him Reichsprotektor of Kongo return, von Hassel's rule is now totally secure from all threats, internal or external. As such, he can move on to the next step of his plan: Using the region as a springboard to put sub saharan Africa under Germany's political and economic influence, forever."

The traitors in Windhoek and Léopoldville have been removed from their offices. Only us Statthalter Hüttig stand tall and nothing will stop him from achieving his vision for Afrika!\n\nAlready the factories are humming and releasing their fumes in preparation for a future of prosperity, and the fields and mines are filled with laborers, gathering metals and rubber for our soldiers. And without the traitors that left the degenerates and the rebels to their own devices, we have access to even more resources to exploit.\n\nNo one can oppose us. With our flanks secured and without the bureaucrats from Germania interfering with our work, the reins of the Reichsstaat are in our hands. Statthalter Hüttig can realize his vision for a Pan-Afrikan Aryan Empire, where the German race can settle and prosper, and where the native learns his place.\n\nOur triumph is inevitable, Statthalter Hüttig will be the Master of Afrika just like Hitler was the Master of Europe.

While the current situation looks quite grim, given how the traitorous administrations in Zentralafrika and Südwestafrika coddled and armed the degenerates, the Statthalter will bring a sorely needed change of pace. The rebels in their arrogance still think they are safe from retribution and are in for a very nasty surprise!"
 MZB_track_the_resistance:0 "Track the Resistance"
 MZB_track_the_resistance_desc:0 "All across Afrika, there are countless small native movements seeking to destroy our civilizing project for the continent. They scurry in the city slums, roam across the savanna, stalk their prey in the jungle. No more! The SS will have to track the whereabouts of every single one of them, they will leave no stone unturned in all of Afrika, and only when the last degenerate rebel will bleed to death can we assume control over the dark continent."

We are so close to achieving our Pan-Afrikan Aryan utopia, and we will not tolerate laziness or incompetence from our SS units!"
 MZB_find_their_supporters:0 "Find their Supporters"
 MZB_find_their_supporters_desc:0 "So it seems that even tracking and neutralizing the terrorist cell down to the single member was not enough. The problem is that our SS units overlooked a very important detail when dealing with the subhumans: they are not alone.

Rudolph Hiemstra stood behind a red-faced Karl Chmielewiski, who himself stood over the radio operator's shoulder. The static was not surprising, given that between the radio and Südafrika Outpost lay many miles of native-controlled veldt.\n\n"Südafrika Outpost, respond!"\n\nStatic was still the only reply. Come on Chmielewiski, we've been standing like this for the last half-hour, if Südafrika Outpost hadn't yet responded, they weren't going to.\n\n"Anyone at Südafrika Outpost? Please come in!"\n\nThe static remained defiant, hissing mockingly at the Kolonialverwalter's denial.\n\nA few minutes of that seemed to be what finally convinced Chmielewiski to quit stalling. He turned around and wordlessly stormed to his desk, pulling out a piece of paper and making an angry scrawl across the bottom that Rudolf supposed could pass for a signature. The Boer liaison took the paper and gave a professional salute before turning on his heels and exiting the building.\n\nScrawl aside, the writing on the paper was line upon line of lawyer-speak detailing a fairly simple contingency plan. In the event that Südafrika should be overrun by the savage hordes and the Reichsstaat could not re-establish contact, the territory was to be given over to the Boers. Rudolf could hardly believe that Herzog had convinced someone like Hüttig to agree to losing territory under any circumstance, but he supposed that, for all Hüttig's greed, the Only Nazi in Africa was arrogant enough to think it would never be acted upon."

The Reichstaat had once stretched from coast to coast, jungle to desert, and now this was all that remained. \n\nIn the minds of many, he knew, it might not remain for much longer. The collapse of Hüttig's grand vision had led to all manners of warlords, bandits, and criminals declaring themselves rulers of the provinces and territories they had once occupied under watchful eyes. They hated each other, yes, but they hated the Germans far more. They would not, could not, passively accept the existence of the Abwehrfront. Conflict was sure to follow.\n\nBut Förschner was a man who had been fighting his entire life, and this was just one more battle. There were many Germans still in Africa, scattered amongst the vast lands they had once ruled, and cut off from any hope of resupply. They needed a refuge. Somewhere to retreat to. He would not abandon them. He would make sure that the territory of the Abwehrfront, small as it was, could provide that refuge. That security.\n\nAnd that would mean compromise. A word that Hüttig - and he himself - had once loathed. A word that now communicated a necessity. To secure the city and the lands around it, compromises with Anglos, Belgians, 'unreliable' Germans, and even the natives would have to be made. Förschnter knew that many of his contemporaries would not be able to do that. And that they, and their men, would die because of it.\n\nHe, and his, would not. They would do what they must to survive. To endure. To prevent a final collapse. Förschtner did not know if he would be successful. But he knew that he would fight to his last breath to try. To keep the Abwehrfront whole.\n\nHe could do no less."

He felt the great weight of the enormity of his task press down upon him.\n\nHüttig was gone. The Reichstaat was gone, collapsed under the strain of hundreds of insurgencies and thousands of atrocities. And he was left to pick up the pieces in the small sliver of territory that remained around the city. It was a tall order, indeed, for he had more problems than he could count.\n\nHis German administrators, or those few that remained, were men of almost limitless brutality, who saw violence as the solution to every problem. Hüttig had, after all, demanded no less, ruthlessly purging those who failed to conform. And the governmental structure had been carefully crafted to encourage such brutal solutions. It was not a recipe for stability, as had been made abundantly clear, and he had to change it. Somehow.\n\nTo do so, he had been forced to recruit allies collecting, in the end, a mixed bag of Anglos, long-nativized Belgians, and other foreigners with nowhere else to go.\n\nThey were decidedly less bloodthirsty than Hüttig's officers, but were also much less reliable. And much less experienced at defending territory. But they filled the gaps, and provided much needed manpower.\n\nVon Hassel was not sure what the future held. He was not sure if the Verwaltung could secure its territory against the surrounding statelets that held nothing but hatred for their former oppressors, and in so doing secure the interests of Germany in Africa. But he did know that he would do everything in his power to further that pursuit, whatever such might entail.\n\nFor there was no alternative."

Acres of pristine white beaches, miles of tropical jungle, and modern hotels and luxury resorts, rivaling those of Spain, Italy, or Prora. Here was the Africa Germany saw, the Africa its visitors were treated to.\n\nBut it was more than beautiful, it was symbolic. Here was the penultimate evidence of the glory of the German Empire, more so than Gibraltar, more so than the entirety of the East. For they had inundated the useless jungle with a massive lake. For the German Reich had taken acres of land crawling with pygmies and built a city every bit as grand and luxurious as one would find in Europe. That was the evidence of the triumph of the Aryan race, a symbol as potent as the Parthenon, the Colosseum, the Pyramids, or even the Volkshalle.\n\nSo it was no surprise it was chosen as the redoubt for the German forces of the region. These men remembered the city, and what it was so long ago. They had been Müller's men, the ones who guarded the construction, the ones who visited it on their time off, and the ones who guarded it from threats for years. If any city would remain German in this jungle, it would be this one.\n\nThe Beafrikan militias would come. But they would be stopped at the city gates.

Now that we are no longer giving them work, they are turning their guns on us. Our SS battalions can doubtless handle an assortment of mongrel war dogs off their leash. Unfortunately, many of them have fallen in with native chieftains and rebel bands, and as a result, the savages have been getting increasingly hard to deal with. Compounding our issues is that many of the untermenschen former Reichskommisar Müller treasonously elevated to administrative positions and even to the SS are still at large. We have reason to suspect that, like the mercenaries, they are lending their skills to native terrorist groups.

Above the judge's chair was a huge photo of the Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig, Master of Africa, flanked on either side by the striking black banners of the Grossafrikaner Reichsstaat and crowned by a bronze Reichsadler whose wings spanned most of the bench. The display combined to impress upon both the accused and the observers the invincibility of Aryan justice.\n\nDoubtless the television cameras being set up around the room would get plenty of footage of that bench.

Coffee in hand, Africa's conqueror strode towards his desk, noticing the envelope on top of the pile, stamped "URGENT: FROM THE DESK OF THE KOLONIALWERWALTER DES KONGOS OTTO FÖRSCHNER."\n\nIt seemed someone had finally managed to decipher one of the hunting maps that worthless buffoon Müller had scribbled out with the Reich's time and resources, and had found Rolf Steiner camping with a band of mercenaries near a Topi herd.\n\nSteiner had been, in Hüttig's mind, the one official in Africa outside of his command who was actually worthy of his rank. Towards the end of the South African War, Steiner had reached out to Hüttig, seeking help in replacing that hot air-filled suit in Leopoldville with someone who at least understood that the post of Reichskommissar meant more than a never ending 'Heia Safari". It was regrettable that a man with such a bright future of service ahead of him had to piss it all away out of jealousy when Otto Förschner was named Kolonialwerwalter des Kongos instead of him.\n\nPutting aside vain thoughts of what could have been, the Reichskommissar typed out his reply."

He's not been seen at any of the usual social clubs he attends, nor has he been observed leaving his home in a week. A search of his house also revealed nothing to indicate where he may have gone, and got a few of my men killed thanks to booby traps the snake left behind. We suspect that Schramme has disappeared into the jungle to organize the Belgian mercenaries. Speaking candidly, this does not bode well. During Müller's administration, the Belgian mercenaries had a repudiation as the most brutal fighters in Zentralafrika, butchering whole villages without a moment's hesitation if they suspected a single rebel of hiding there. They've only gotten more ferocious since we've taken over, stalking through the jungle and sadistically slaughtering anyone they can get their hands on, German, Anglo, French, or native. If Schramme has taken to honing the Belgians' fury with his organizational talents, together they may form the greatest threat our administration has yet seen. We urgently request that more SS units be deployed to the Kongos as soon as possible."

Most of the SS units under my command are spent guarding the Congo Dam, their numbers dwindle by the day. We've been able to rebuff all attacks on the dam so far, but should anyone break through our defenses, the colony will be utterly ruined. Beyond the dam, rebels are running roughshod over the country. Just three days ago, one of the Kongo's largest plantations had all it's overseers massacred as the slaves used SS-style tactics to overcome the guards. Every week it seems, one of our SS squads goes missing on the march, and searchers find their heads on stakes and their bodies tied to trees with their own intestines. Resistance on the part of the untermenschen to the Aryan race's rightful dominance is nothing new, of course, but these rebels are being armed, trained, and organized by Reichsstaat Generals. While it is true that these Generals were traitors to Race and Fatherland, I worry that our "arrest on sight" policy is driving trained, dangerous men into the jungle, where they stir up rebellious elements, and further hinder the Aryanization of the Kongo."

Activity of note includes a raid on an airfield in southern Namibe province. The airfield had been minimally staffed following the conclusion of the South Afrikan war, mainly housing disused and damaged planes and radio equipment with which contact was maintained with local governments in West Afrika.\n\nThe base was found put to the torch by a patrolling SS unit, with hangars and administration buildings razed and a large quantity of explosives detonated on the runway to deny its further use. It is the opinion of this administration that the attackers targeted the facility to acquire aviation equipment, perhaps to establish contacts of their own with local governments and acquire materiel support from outside the Reichsstaat.

Recently a wide-band radio broadcast has been detected in stations across Angola. Sent in Portugese, the message claims to be the work of UNITA, the so-called "National Union for the Total Independence of Angola". The contents of the message, omitting pointless grandstanding, were a call to the native Angolans to resist the lawful government and prepare for a war of independence. The station transmitting the message is yet to be located, but will soon be destroyed.\n\nLocal garrison leaders have been ordered to prepare for a possible period of unrest due to the message. It is unknown precisely how many settlements received the message due to low ownership of personal radios in the colony, though its power was reportedly sufficient to be heard in neighbouring Kongo.

Garrison commanders report churlishness from the locals in rural areas. Most notably, a scheduled patrol of the outskirts of Luanda failed to make radio contact at the designated time. When a second patrol was sent to backtrack their route, their bodies were found mutilated in a ditch by the side of the road. Upon examination, both the bodies and the surrounding area showed signs of a short firefight. No partisan bodies were recovered - the attackers either sustained no casualties or brought their dead with them.\n\nThe brazenness of this attack is concerning. The location of the bodies was such that even if a call for reinforcements had been made it would be highly unlikely any other patrol would be able to reach the area in time, and the violence of the attack only serves to conceal it's skilled planning. I find it unlikely that the natives could effectively plan an attack such as this - I suspect there exists a dissident element within the German population funneling information to UNITA.

Following the massacre of patrols outside Luanda, investigations were made into past connections of South Afrikan War recruits, before their immigration from Germany. It was revealed that of the Luanda Garrison, a large proportion of South Afrikan War recruits had maintained connections with university socialist groups during the Bürgerkrieg. It is likely that they were sent here primarily to remove their corrupting influence from polite German society, with their competency in battle a secondary concern.\n\nWith this knowledge it was a simple task to determine which of these men had maintained unauthorized contact with the natives, and interrogation revealed a small clique actively funneling information to UNITA itself. Once the clique was identified all garrison members with socialist backgrounds were detained and executed in short order.

The relative autonomy granted to the English populations in Sambia has produced a society in which natives and white settlers can, for the most part, accommodate one another. However, this situation has also produced the potential for rebel activity, including socialist-aligned movements which have demonstrated past ties to the ANC. Such a situation is unacceptable.\n\nHowever, the appointment of Hans Möser to the position of Kolonialverwalter post-annexation has, to the English, upended the careful balance among the peoples of Sambia. One recent incident which has become a particular flashpoint of tension was the arrest and summary execution of three notable black merchants in the Chelston neighborhood of Lusaka, for suspected guerilla ties. An open letter written by Michael Grigg, an Englishman, militia officer, and prominent member of the settler community, has requested that the Kolonialverwalter's regime take a lighter touch with Sambia, to lower tensions and encourage free economic activity.

Prior to the annexation of Botswana by the Reichsstaat, the region was under the control of South Africa, and was home to tens of thousands of Afrikaner settlers. Many are currently prosperous farmers and merchants, and are especially concentrated in parts of the Kalahari Desert. With the annexation, it would seem that many of these Botswana Afrikaners would prefer to live in the Boer Republic, for various political, social, and economic reasons.\n\nAccording to the Boer Ministry of Home Affairs, approximately 1,180 Botswana Afrikaners have crossed the border into the Republic in the past month, and have requested asylum pursuant to receiving Boer citizenship. Of these, approximately 800 have been deported back into the Reichsstaat, with the remainder having been taken into temporary custody.

Förschner realized then that it was all lost, he hurried to pick up the phone and tell Rudel to prepare an evacuation. Where to, he didn't know, just anywhere but here. It was too late, of course.\n\nNo one picked up the phone, Förschner was paralyzed. Soon enough he would know why: A mass defection of remaining Afrikaner Luftwaffe squadrons to Argentina and Saint Helena had taken place. He threw away the report from Sudwestafrika before reading it, without the Luftwaffe, it was as good as lost. No more reports came in after that, for as the Staathalter knew, Oberkommando des Reichsstaates now existed only in name.\n\nBy the end of the day, Förschner had a clearer picture of the "Reichsstaat's" position: Doomed.

Its locations for the placement of propaganda are easily-recognizable and consistent, allowing us to both catch many active dissidents and prevent their works from being seen by the larger population. These sub-par attempts at dissidence by this group, TANU, signals to us stability in the region, as any and all active dissident groups are under close watch and serve no threat to the Reichstaat. All risk of insurgency, or uprising, is soon to be eliminated, it is assured."

Their attack appeared spontaneously, without warning from collaborating Native forces, whom we can therefore assume to be involved. Our local Schutzstaffel units have successfully repelled SWAVO's attempts to seize control of the city centre, and have forced heavy casualties in a victorious delaying action against the insurrection. Unfortunately, in the process, they have lost control over both the city's outskirts and much of the surrounding countryside to the rebels. The situation here is urgent: the sheer number of dissidents surrounding Windhoek has led to our garrison suffering ammunition shortages in dealing with them all. Urgent reinforcements will be required to relieve the siege and free local forces to mop up the remaining participants."

Whilst we've been successful in crushing the insurrection, and executions of captured dissidents are commencing, the situation in Windhoek deteriorated considerably between our receipt of reinforcements and their eventual arrival and victory. SWAVO units were able to induce their chaos across almost the entirety of Windhoek, inducing numerous casualties and reducing Schutzstaffel control to a few fortified locations. The most worrying part of it all, though, were the reactions of Windhoek's native untermensch populace to the rebels' invasion. Reports have arrived at my desk that Sam Nujoma, SWAVO's leader, was seen walking the streets of Windhoek openly during the siege, waving to the rowdy crowds of savages and sharing triumphant cheers with a seemingly largely rebel-supporting populace. Investigations are already commencing to discern the identities of those who participated in these demonstrations, but the fact they occurred at all is a profoundly worrying sign of the state of mind of the populace."

Our local intelligence assets have pinpointed the true identity of the Ker as one 'Jaramogi Oginga Odinga', a recognized chieftain of a Luo tribe in the colony's interior. Odinga has been a known dissident since the earliest days of Aryan dominance in Afrika, but his non-violence has led to his activities largely being ignored in the face of more radical, violent dissidence from other local community leaders. Recently, though, the Ker's low-level resistance to the Reichstaat's dominion has escalated, and he has issued a public call for sovereignty for the Luo, and the creation of a "union of the Luo people against the tyrants". Obviously, this is nonsense, and Odinga and his compatriots have no power to resist the Aryan domination of Afrika. The so-called 'Ker' is not a serious threat to our rule, but the thinly veiled treason of Odinga's decree is still enough to warrant an additional show of force in Kenia, to deter sympathy for Odinga's call to action."

Despite the ominous name, all of our intelligence suggests that these so-called brigades are something closer in number to an SS gruppe, consisting of only a handful of 'brigades' of a dozen or so men each. Such a small force is barely worthy of a blip on the radar, and would stand absolutely no chance of offering even piecemeal resistance to Schutzstaffel authority. Owing to this, a plan has been concocted to use the Luo Brigades as a tool of entrapment, allowing the most extreme local separatist elements to coalesce into a single identifiable group, to be purged once the opportunity is right. This will help to curtail the low-level of active resistance endemic to Ostafrika, and make our future administration more secure over the long term."

Back in 1947, when our administration had not yet solidified, the same dissident we now know as the Ker established an organization called the "Luo Thrift and Trading Corporation". A private company run by Oginga Odinga himself, the purpose of this corporation was to advance the ethnic interests of the Luo tribes, assisting them in establishing businesses and offering financial and technical advice. The corporation was shut down by an SS raid in 1949, when Aryan control over Kenia was tightened, but we have received word that it is now active again, operating in secret inside the region's black market. Between the Ker's sovereignty decree, the Luo Brigades, and now the reemergence of this nationalist organization, it has become apparent that the time for our trap to be sprung is now. The suspected headquarters of the Luo Thrift and Trading Corporation will be raided in the days ahead, as will the known sites of congregation of the previously established 'Luo Brigades'.

Our intelligence on the location of the corporation's nexus was wrong, but our attempted raid (and the successful capture of some known members of the Luo Brigades) was enough to trigger a strong response from native resistance. A separatist pirate radio station popular with the untermenschen has made a disturbing edict, announcing the formation of the "Popular Government for Sovereignty": a pretense to a sovereign state, led by Ker Oginga Odinga and a compatriot and known separatist, Achieng Oneko. The Luo Brigades have apparently greatly bolstered in number under our noses, and an upswell of ethnic nationalism has taken sway over the Luo people, under the leadership of their Ker.

The war was won; the Amerikaner got routed; and the spineless traitors in Léopoldville and Windhoek were relieved from their offices. It was a morning of victory.\n\nHüttig sat behind the desk. The new chair was sturdy and comfortable without being too luxurious, but most importantly it didn't creak. The Statthalter took a moment to enjoy this improvement, and then took a file on top from the massive pile to his right, and in it he found a report by the SS divisions in Bechuanaland detailing the growth of resistance activity in the region and that it is needed more recruits and supplies to tackle the emergency.\n\nHüttig took a glance at the document pile. If his hunch was right, all those other files would contain the same reports, the only thing that would change is where they happened. But after all, he was now in control over a territory that stretched from the Congo Sea to Cape Town, it was only natural that it would take more effort to control it.

Wondering if his most important underlings even understood what transpired from the countless reports, a brisk voice rose among the ranks, asking for explanations. "Name and rank, officer", Hüttig replied.\n\n"Standartenführer Schmidt, sir! Are we to understand that due to negligence from former Reichskommissar Schenck and Müller, not only we lack vital intel, but some that we have might be compromised, is that correct?" "Precisely." "Then we have to assume that every native is an enemy, right?"\n\nA cold smile ran across Hüttig's face. "Yes, Standartenführer. Everyone might be an enemy.

We must use everything at hand to eradicate the barbarity that those traitors let happen under their watch. Of course, you will have full discretionary power in how you decide to neutralize threats. Any other questions?" "No sir!" "Very well. Dismissed!"\n\nWith a brisk heil, the officers rose from their chairs and went out the room in perfect unison.

But first, the betrayal of greatness and the true Aryan must be punished, and the splitters in the south brought back into the fold. In the process, the traitors would die, slowly and painfully. All of these things, Hüttig explained to his attendant in loud, clear terms.

They would need the SS on the border, guns, bombs, and gas. Any man who did not kneel before his Aryan overlords would die before them. South Africa, of course, would be theirs.

The festering, writhing and despicable hives of corruption and degeneracy that were the Reichskommissariats under the rule of the flyboy Schenck and the hedonist, crockpot of savagery known as Müller are testaments to these eternal laws of the Aryan race.\n\nThey let loose the savage, pleasure-chasing baboons of native Afrika onto the supple hides of our stoic, Aryan soldiers. What was the result of this free, haphazard blood-mixing? Müller's men became one with the apes and wild beasts of the land, chasing creature comforts and throwing themselves into cultures of inherent barbarity. Schenck's men feminized themselves, until they were unable to even lift a finger against the very insurgents who were lodging bullets into their necks, those who continue to attempt to exterminate our race man to man. We are at the brink of absolute, total racial catastrophe, and the only thing standing between us and them is a thin line of those most dedicated, brave and virtuous Aryan soldiers who beat back the gripping claws of wretched, ever-corrupting Aryan de-evolution.\n\nOn the orders of our Staathalter, a regimen of intense, nonstop training known as der Afrikanische Code, added to ruthless and merciless constant punishments in order to terrify the wandering minds of our troops into conformity, has been initiated on our units. The Staathalter is convinced, in order for the murky, darkened blood of our Aryans in Afrika to purify themselves, our soldiers must live and die hard through a program of Spartanism in all things, especially in military affairs. Our missions, our goals and efforts will all be pointless if the Aryan race we are working to secure Afrika for is tainted, puppeted by the very black savages we wish to extinguish from the face of humanity."

Your subversion and overthrowing of the wickedness and hedonistic traitors who once ruled over these lands has proved just in the eyes of this realm, as your choices in employing our skill in the desolation of these subhuman menaces has proven as successful as can be, with the Großafrikaner Reichsstaat having grown more powerful with every waking moment of our successes.\n\nIn particular, Active Partisan Suppression Mission-0199 detailed the summary execution of all rebellious actors within Area X-0199 in the Northern Sector of the Reichsstaat. In the accomplishment of the mission, our forces entered active combat with the rebel actors, resulting in the deaths of FIFTY-FOUR individual partisans, whilst our regiment incurred TWELVE casualties from the fighting. Afterwards, all allies and sympathizers of the partisans were executed as well, resulting in an additional NINETEEN deaths.\n\nMeine Ehre heißt Treue.

Whilst we swear by the greatness in your managing of taking reign over these arid wastelands through the overthrowing of the anarchic and treasonous Reichskommissars of yesteryear, the might of our presence here has spurred many of the subhuman natives into clamoring to arms, and managed to repel the forces of our attack yesterday.\n\nIn summary, Active Partisan Suppression Mission-0199 detailed the destruction of all rebellious actors, as well as the summary execution of all those found aiding or sympathetic to their actions, within Area X-0199 in the Northern Sector of the Reichsstaat. Unfortunately, with the natives managing to take hold of various weapon caches, and a greater level of organization than previously expected, our forces were unable to capture and control the stronghold, resulting in the deaths of THIRTY-FIVE soldiers of the Schutzstaffel regiment. In total, we were able to bring down TWELVE combatants before having to issue the retreat.

Instead, all that Hans Hüttig's heart bore that morning was the intention on finding the fruits of his warlike labor, and the hatred he harbored for the very land which cast such glorious rays down upon him, and all within the walls and upon the gate to a military base within Quelimane. Now, with the sound of the opening gates to Quelimane's walls ringing out alongside the combustion of the Schutzstaffel's trucks, Statthalter Hans Hüttig eagerly awaited what the shedding of African blood would merit the Reichstaat.\n\nHüttig's steely gazed opened in awe as he saw the incoming convoy and the bounty they hauled. Entire trucks had been filled with weapons stolen from caches, and new military vehicles drove in sync with the convoy, replenishing the vehicles wasted in these dire wars throughout Africa. Hüttig nearly cracked a smile as he saw the enlisted personnel of the Großafrikanischer SS labor to move the crates of guns to their supply depots, with cranes and trucks working for the glory of the Reichstaat.\n\n"Sir, Statthalter, sir." suddenly saluted an officer next to Hüttig, prompting him to return the salute as his gaze upon the bounty had been broken.\n\n"Yes, yes, what is it, Obersturmbannführer?" said Hüttig.\n\n"Well, sir, I just wished to report, as the commanding officer of the raiding missions which have just returned, that the men eagerly and bravely served upon the frontlines, and that the Großafrikanischer SS has proven to be an utter success for your reign's glory." the officer said, before issuing a salute."\n\nHüttig began to crack a wicked smile in light of the Obersturmbannführer's report."

 MZB_REICHSTAAT_FOCUS.39.desc:0 "A REMINDER TO THE PEOPLES OF THE BOER REPUBLIC\n\nDue to your status as a Vasallenstaat, the Boers are given a degree of autonomy not permitted to other aspects of the Großafrikanischer Reichsstaat. This is in order to be certain that the Aryan Boer peoples, oppressed under the rule of natives and Englishmen, are able to experience the inherent freedom of Aryanism. This, however, comes with several responsibilities to the Reichsstaat. It should not be taken as full independence, and such a thing should never be desired.\n\nAs a Vasallenstaat, the foremost responsibility of the Boer peoples is loyalty to the Reichsstaat and the Staathalter-SS, as well as loyalty to National Socialism and the principles that govern all who adhere to it. You are still, for all purposes and functions, peoples of the Reichsstaat and again, must adhere to any and all orders, prohibitions, laws, or requests made of you by the Staathalter-SS.\n\nThis is not to be seen as a restriction of said freedom, but only as the full realization of the freedom and power granted to the Aryan race. After all, only weak men see freedom as the power to act as one wishes. That is hedony and laziness, and it is a form of slavery to the desires of man. The only way for an Aryan to be truly free, is to freely choose a life of strength, Spartanism, and obedience. And as members of the Vasallenstaat, all of you are to be held to the same standard.\n\nMay National Socialism burn in your hearts forever!"

 MZB_REICHSTAAT_FOCUS.40.desc:0 ""How about eighty percent of the funds are given to us?" Hüttig suggested to the Boer businessman, who sat nervously at the edge of the chair. "The peoples of German Africa are the only reason that your state even has those mines. The peoples of the Reichsstaat are the only reason you have a state. You would do well to remember that." He chided the man. Sometimes, Hüttig thought it would be easier to simply seize the diamonds themselves. It was not as if the Boers had the ability to stop them from doing so, and it would stop all this hem-hawing.\n\nThe businessman, for his part, seemed very reluctant about the deal. "Eighty percent? Herr... Staathalter, please, we need funds in order to keep operations going! Twenty percent of a usual month's returns is only barely enough to pay for workers and mining equipment!" He looked into Hüttig's eyes, searching for mercy. In them, he found none. "Perhaps sixty percent, or sixty-five. We could pay sixty-five."\n\nHüttig scowled. "If twenty percent of your usual haul is not enough to keep your company off the ground, then perhaps you should look to bring in bigger hauls. The Reichsstaat is the only thing keeping you alive, and we require funding as well. Allowing you to line your pockets is not a priority of mine, nor has it ever been." He would give eighty percent, or he would learn the Reichsstaat's wrath.\n\nFor his part, the beaten businessman nodded. "Eighty percent. Yes, yes. It can be done." He slinked out of the room, and Hüttig called for the next official."

As the bus screeched to a halt and its tires kicked up the dust, Hüttig hissed through the searing African heat for the driver to stop and for the prisoners to be thrown out of their metal shell.\n\nHe was glad the Boers had agreed to his demands. They were nothing special, after all, and they knew that Hüttig had more right than anyone else to deal with the fates of anyone who went against the Reichsstaat. The inferior African scum packed together with traitors of the white race-- particularly the fiendish Boers who decided to betray their heritage. Disgust filled his features.\n\nAnd it seemed like he was not the only one. A young Zulu man among the group, though battered and weary, looked over Hüttig like he was nothing but a common Nazi, and gave him a look of vitriolic hate. Hüttig grit his teeth together, his constant anger starting to swell up again as he imagined what was running through this pathetic 'freedom fighter's mind. For a second too long did he stare, and Hüttig took that as an act of rebellion. With a whistle and a crack of his voice, two armed men approached and took the man out of the group by force.\n\nEveryone pretended to ignore the violent beating that followed after the sudden shouting and cursing, and the sobbing that trailed off into nothingness."

Some kind of trick from the Cape?"\n\n"Maybe. Have the men ready either way."\n\nAs the column of troops came into focus, they did indeed appear to be Germans. The colours, the armoured vehicles, the rifles, all signs pointed towards it, but surely they would have mentioned something? The Kolonel refrained from opening hostilities, and accompanied by the Luitenant and a sole squad, they awaited their impromptu visitors outside the gates. Their counterparts halted perhaps a hundred metres outside, and a similar delegation approached. Their leader; by his uniform a Standartenführer, with an immaculately curated and curled moustache halted a few paces from the Kolonel, hands behind his back.\n\n"You are in command here?"\n\n"I am Commander Van der Merwe-"\n\n"Incorrect. Pietersburg Base is now under the command of the Großafrikaner Reichsstaat. Your presence is no longer required. Most of your menials will be retained - your officers, however, can return home."

For being so reliable, your independence will be assured, even though your fate is determined solely by my judgement.\n\nAs we speak, the fate of the Dark Continent is being decided, one lesser being at a time. Eventually, I hope that what remains will be fit to rule over the vast and rich territory that the Aryan people have conquered. As Staathalter, I personally request closer cooperation in every part of governing policy, both internal and foreign, as your nation is tied incredibly closely to ours, we must use everything we have to efficiently cleanse the many stains Africa has gathered.\n\nI can assure you that both the Republic and the Reichsstaat will prosper in the coming days of Africa, and perhaps I could deem it fit for the Boers to reap some of the rewards sown.

As you should know, while we have forced the withdrawal of the Americans, there are still significant amounts of soldiers who work as mercenaries for the natives."\n\nHertzog responded, "I am aware of that issue-"\n\n"And I also am aware that you do not wish to spend resources dealing with them.

 MZB_REICHSTAAT_FOCUS.45.desc:0 "Every step former Major Jabulani took was painful. The bayonet wound that dug into his back had not yet fully healed-- clearly Hüttig's men thought it irrelevant, even though it left him exhausted. When they shattered South Africa, they took Jabulani not as another source of slave labor, but as a tool of information. They had found out that the South African Army had information about OFN intervention. They were especially interested in the complex plans devised between high-ranking members of both the SAA and the armies of the OFN. The intelligence was saved in documents and recordings across South Africa, and Hüttig's men wanted every single one.\n\nHe didn't speak to the SS soldiers that flanked him as he was pushed and prodded into entering his own office. They figured snarls and rifles were enough to force him to obey - and, as it turned out, Jabulani valued his life more than the notion of resistance. All that would get him would be a bullet in his head. When he fuddled for his keys and got the door open, he could see his office riddled with paperwork and drawers fit to be opened. Jabulani wanted to speak out, but there was nothing to say as the soldiers that were there to guard him suddenly moved past, beginning to ravage through everything in the room.\n\nNervousness swelled through him. What would happen to him, now that they had all they needed? He got the opportunity to see the camps. So many starved faces there-- he didn't want to join them. But before Jabulani even began thinking about the opportunity to run, he could hear the two SS men exchange a short conversation in German, and during his time in the war there was a single word he learned that was ingrained into his memory.\n\nAs Jabulani turned to run, one of the SS raised their rifle and sprayed three rounds, one hitting the waist, one the stomach, and one the chest. Shortly afterwards, the former Major's body hit the ground, and he did not breathe another."

With plentiful food, guns, and radio communications, the four of them established links with many more across the former territory of South Africa. They'd have to leave eventually, but for now, they would exploit the fact that they were under Hüttig's radar as much as possible.\n\nWhen Mwai took the night patrol, skulking around the grass and looking through his AN/PVS-2 scope, for a time it was always the same. Nothing but dreadful silence. He wondered often where Hüttig's countless murderers were, if they finally decided to circle around a forgotten bunker and empty it out, or if they were too busy gassing out civilians. He didn't want to know the answer.\n\nAs strobes of moonlight struck through his scope, Mwai saw something in the far-off distance move. Something told him it moved with lethal intent, but he barely began pushing against the ground when he heard the crack through the air and something rip straight through his shoulder, piercing through his arm. Mwani gasped for breath, pain suddenly overwhelming his mind- but he resisted, if only momentarily, getting to his feet and shuffling towards the entrance of the bunker, screaming about how Hüttig's men had found them out, and how they had to run, and-"

Bereft of anything resembling civilization outside of shacks long since emptied out of life, Unterscharführer Tobias and his squad of three, as well as an informant from the Boer Republic, found themselves kicking in the doors of shack after shack within a small localized area, having heard reports that the degenerate Bolshevik known as Joe Slovo camped out within Southern Botswana.\n\nHaving taken the necessary precautions, Tobias motioned for his men to stand ready as they slowly approached a low, grey building in the searing heat, rifles aimed towards both the door and the windows as they carefully approached. Then, as all three of his men gathered next to the door, two on one side, the last on the other, Tobias held his weapon firmly within his grasp, checking through his sights and giving a few seconds of total silence as he waited to see if Joe would make his presence clear. When nothing came, he signalled for an assault, and his men breached the doors open in a flash.\n\nAs the initial rush of adrenaline passed, with Tobias and his men storming into the small outpost, what met them was no sort of gunfire or trap or anything of the sort. Instead, it was the subdued crackling of flames scattered across an overturned desk on the floor, with ash and paper signifying that they had arrived far too late. Tobias, feeling a pang of anger, turned to the Boer operative and gave him a seething stare. The man in turn looked at him coldly - and their glances exchanged all the words needed to be exchanged."

We are a surgeon of death, terror and destruction, for this is all what the fluid, rancid untermensch castes below the feet of us Aryan masters deserve.\n\nWith tactical precision we snap telephone lines, break open systems of plumbing, tear into air raid shelters, and blast apart broadcasting stations and military outposts. The black savage-beasts who rebel against our grip over the South African countryside will learn the painful, torturous reality of starvation, drought and disease on a national scale. As if maggots, they will scamper from out of their dank, disgusting hiding places to avoid their doom, forming ever-flowing "veins" of subhuman blood throughout South Africa as we fulfill our racial duty upon their open, unguarded bodies.\n\nOur Staathalter has put into motion Operation Rotes Gewitter, or Operation "Red Thunderstorm", in order to utilize our aerial dominance to beat, and to whip, the rebellious South African countryside into subservience. This operation's duty is not merely to smoke out rebels, or to kill a few ringleaders, but to facilitate the demographic collapse of the South African countryside en masse, lest they further slip from our grasp. It will be a "Red Thunderstorm" indeed, as hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons of pure, feral carnage will sweep South Africa in a great, stormy inferno of rage and rancor, raining down from our all-powerful and all-mighty air force onto the rat-like untermensch below. In the fallout, all that will remain will be the Reichstaat's chains around South Africa's neck, and the Staathalter would have it no other way."

Emulating the style of Reich's generalfeldmarschalls, Karl Chmielewski inspects the tanks one by one, eyeing their cannons, all perfectly elevated to 45 degrees. In truth, Chmielewski didn't have a very good idea of what he was doing, he was a camp commandant, not a general. To him, the panzers might as well be magic machines, and whatever the officers told him about the status of the tanks, he could only respond to with a nodding agreement and vague comments about the efficiency of the aryan war machine.\n\nNo sooner does Chmielewski's pretend-inspection end than a kubelwagen bearing the official insignia of the Staathalter pulls into the parade ground.\n\n"Heil Hüttig!." The familiar salutation is exchanged between the Gruppenführer and the staff officer, before the latter hands a letter to the former: The Staathalter's orders. Chmielewski knows what they are, nevertheless he hopes for something else, to no avail. Hüttig's only command is to take "complete control of the Vasallenstaat."\n\nAn acute discomfort begins to build up on Chmielewski's chest as he looks around him:\n\nThe Puma's taking off from that helipads, the conscripts running laps around the base, and the tanks still on parade. These were all great instruments of war, but would they be enough to reconquer the whole country? Chmielewski didn't think so. Nonetheless, he would do as he was told."

Of all the appalling incompetence he'd seen during his failed expedition to South Africa, the absolutely disastrous evacuation of Upington was by far the worst. Hundreds of wounded men, left to die alongside large quantities of equipment now in the hands of the Reichsstaat's enemies. It was precisely the humiliating disaster which he had been ordered to avert, and he had failed.\n\nIn view of this fact, he had no expectations of walking out alive when he went into the Staathalter's office. For the first few seconds of the meeting, Chmielewski's only hope was the relief of knowing he was likely to be shot by firing squad rather than sent to a camp. However, Hüttig's reaction to his presence was far... sadder.\n\n"It was a mistake. I should have known supporting those degenerate Boer... subhumans was going to backfire." Looking back at Chmielewski, his instinct was to order him away to a Kozentrazionslagger at once, but he paused. Not only would killing the Gruppenfuhrer be politically ill advised given the Reichtaat's now vulnerable frontier to the south, but more fundamentally, this was no one's failure but his own."

With a visible sense of urgency they walked towards the Führer, curtly cutting their way through the gathering of media.\n\nNoticing the sudden interruption of his speech, Göring shot a cold look towards the approaching officers, yet noticing the look of urgency and worry upon the faces of the approaching men, he restrained himself from lashing out towards the sudden interruption.\n\n"What warrants this interruption?" the Führer asked with a reserved voice, turning himself and the newly arrived officers away from the newsmen.\n\n"Mein Führer, I apologize for the curt interruption, but we have news from Africa. It's Reichskommissar Hüttig. Best spoken away from prying ears." replied the most senior of the three officers, seemingly short of breath.\n\nGiving the officers a nod, Göring briefly returned to the press to charismatically apologize for his early departure, before quickly walking to his motorcade and departing with the three officers.\n\nThe reporters would have their front page news story.""

Hewel finished.\n\nThe Führer once again did not reply, continuing to stare at the wall with glazed eyes, moving only to extinguish his spent cigarettes and light another. Hewel could not help but contemplate to himself as he stood in the uneasy silence; was this the same man in whom the German people had placed their confidence?\n\nHewel would not be left long to his thoughts, as the Führer returned to life.
