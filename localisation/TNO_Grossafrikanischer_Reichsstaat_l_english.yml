 POLITICS_OTTO_FORSCHNER_DESC:0 "오토 푀르슈너는 이제 남은 여생을 아프리카에서 머물겠지만, 그가 어떻게 지내느냐는 그의 행동에 달려있습니다.\n\nAfter going along with the late Statthalter's insanity throughout the duration of his regime, the Kolonialverwalter of Kongo was convinced by other erstwhile Hüttig loyalists of the need to eliminate him in order to save his own skin. While the plan succeeded, it also deprived the Reichsstaat of the element that held it together: Fear of Hüttig. Therefore, the once mighty German Africa was quickly reduced to a rump state, desperately clinging on to Leopoldville.\n\nCharged with the responsibility of leading the remnants of the Reichsstaat's administrative core into living another day, Förschner must first deal with the unworkable mess of a state he has been left with. Given that he has no hope of ever returning to Germany, his only chance for survival is to reconstruct the institutions that once propped up Siegfried Müller's Zentralafrika regime, and use them to strengthen himself against the inevitable attack from the west. Luckily for him, the Congo has descended into total chaos, which buys the Afrikaner Abwehrfront some much needed time."
 POLITICS_KAI_UWE_VON_HASSEL_DESC:0 "Born in German East Africa during the First World War, Kai-Uwe von Hassel returned to his native continent in the aftermath of Germany's victory in the second. A respected administrator in Zentralafrika, von Hassel was invited to take part in Hans Hüttig's imminent takeover of the colony by Rolf Steiner. Having no choice, he pretended to go along with the plan, but secretly led an organization which sought to overthrow the Statthalter and restore German rule.\n\nWith Germany's heavy investment in the South African War having earned the loyalty of many in the bureaucracy, von Hassel was able to undermine Hüttig's regime, hastening its fall, and saving the Cape from his grasp. Moreover, he was able to betray Otto Förschner, with whom he had temporarily allied himself with, after the latter killed Hüttig.\n\nWhile the Statthalter's death proved the final blow for German rule over the continent at large, von Hassel managed to secure the mouth of the Congo river for the Reich. With a grateful Führer appointing him Reichsprotektor of Kongo return, von Hassel's rule is now totally secure from all threats, internal or external. As such, he can move on to the next step of his plan: Using the region as a springboard to put sub saharan Africa under Germany's political and economic influence, forever."

The Boer liaison took the paper and gave a professional salute before turning on his heels and exiting the building.\n\nScrawl aside, the writing on the paper was line upon line of lawyer-speak detailing a fairly simple contingency plan. In the event that Südafrika should be overrun by the savage hordes and the Reichsstaat could not re-establish contact, the territory was to be given over to the Boers. Rudolf could hardly believe that Herzog had convinced someone like Hüttig to agree to losing territory under any circumstance, but he supposed that, for all Hüttig's greed, the Only Nazi in Africa was arrogant enough to think it would never be acted upon."

And he was left to pick up the pieces in the small sliver of territory that remained around the city. It was a tall order, indeed, for he had more problems than he could count.\n\nHis German administrators, or those few that remained, were men of almost limitless brutality, who saw violence as the solution to every problem. Hüttig had, after all, demanded no less, ruthlessly purging those who failed to conform. And the governmental structure had been carefully crafted to encourage such brutal solutions. It was not a recipe for stability, as had been made abundantly clear, and he had to change it. Somehow.\n\nTo do so, he had been forced to recruit allies collecting, in the end, a mixed bag of Anglos, long-nativized Belgians, and other foreigners with nowhere else to go.\n\nThey were decidedly less bloodthirsty than Hüttig's officers, but were also much less reliable. And much less experienced at defending territory. But they filled the gaps, and provided much needed manpower.\n\nVon Hassel was not sure what the future held. He was not sure if the Verwaltung could secure its territory against the surrounding statelets that held nothing but hatred for their former oppressors, and in so doing secure the interests of Germany in Africa. But he did know that he would do everything in his power to further that pursuit, whatever such might entail.\n\nFor there was no alternative."

That was the evidence of the triumph of the Aryan race, a symbol as potent as the Parthenon, the Colosseum, the Pyramids, or even the Volkshalle.\n\nSo it was no surprise it was chosen as the redoubt for the German forces of the region.

We found several diaries kept by the slaves where "Mobutu Sese Seko" is referenced as an inspirational figure. We also found a note that implied that some of the slaves had been in contact with a savage terror group led by Mobutu. We believe that Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, the black savage that the traitor Müller insanely promoted to a commanding position in the SS, has been turning his SS training against our righteous cause, commanding a terrorist organization of natives and escaped slaves, under the name "Mobutu Sese Seko". Upon your order, my men will commence a search around the plantation for any hidden footpaths that Mobutu's agents might have used to get in contact with these slaves. Hopefully, these trails will lead us right to the snake's den."

 GRO_REICHSSTAAT.302.desc:0 "The Leopoldville courthouse was an exemplar of Spartanist design principles. The chosen guests filed into a large, square room and took their seats in folding chairs. The hot Kongo sun overcame the court's feeble air conditioning, and the guests' sweat soon soaked the collars of their dark woolen uniforms, despite the breeze coming through the open windows and doors. At the front of the courtroom stood the sole extravagance the design (or the budget) would allow, an enormous judge's bench, built of oak imported directly from the Fatherland. Above the judge's chair was a huge photo of the Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig, Master of Africa, flanked on either side by the striking black banners of the Grossafrikaner Reichsstaat and crowned by a bronze Reichsadler whose wings spanned most of the bench. The display combined to impress upon both the accused and the observers the invincibility of Aryan justice.\n\nDoubtless the television cameras being set up around the room would get plenty of footage of that bench. As the cameras went live, the accused traitors, ex-Zentralafrikan Generals Hugh van Oppen and Gerd von Blottnitz, were brought before the bench, looking appropriately disheveled. During the trial, everyone played their assigned roles to perfection. The prosecutor ruthlessly questioned the accused, who provided one confession after another. Yes, they supplied guns to native rebels. Yes, they allowed untermenschen to defile the hallowed ranks of the SS. Yes they allowed the decadent wealth of foreign Judeo-Capitalist businesses to sway them from their sacred task of civilising the savage heart of Africa. All the while, the defense attorney gave stammering, blubbering, half-hearted excuses. After about an hour of this performance, the judge swung his gavel down:\n\n"I pronounce the accused, Hugh van Oppen and Gerd von Blottnitz, guilty of high treason. Their sentence shall be...""

Towards the end of the South African War, Steiner had reached out to Hüttig, seeking help in replacing that hot air-filled suit in Leopoldville with someone who at least understood that the post of Reichskommissar meant more than a never ending 'Heia Safari". It was regrettable that a man with such a bright future of service ahead of him had to piss it all away out of jealousy when Otto Förschner was named Kolonialwerwalter des Kongos instead of him.\n\nPutting aside vain thoughts of what could have been, the Reichskommissar typed out his reply."

We suspect that Schramme has disappeared into the jungle to organize the Belgian mercenaries. Speaking candidly, this does not bode well. During Müller's administration, the Belgian mercenaries had a repudiation as the most brutal fighters in Zentralafrika, butchering whole villages without a moment's hesitation if they suspected a single rebel of hiding there. They've only gotten more ferocious since we've taken over, stalking through the jungle and sadistically slaughtering anyone they can get their hands on, German, Anglo, French, or native.

Upon examination, both the bodies and the surrounding area showed signs of a short firefight. No partisan bodies were recovered - the attackers either sustained no casualties or brought their dead with them.\n\nThe brazenness of this attack is concerning. The location of the bodies was such that even if a call for reinforcements had been made it would be highly unlikely any other patrol would be able to reach the area in time, and the violence of the attack only serves to conceal it's skilled planning.

One critical juncture of this economy is trade across Viktoria See, the vast tropical lake whose shores touch many regions of the Reichsstaat, along with Italian East Africa. Now, that juncture is being threatened. The warlords which have threatened Uganda's traditional kingdoms and chiefdoms have turned their gaze to Uganda's ports. Reports have come of ongoing battles between various factions in coastal towns like Jinja, Entebbe, and Namulanda. This fighting has disrupted local commerce and claimed dozens of lives so far.

Though the movement has been effectively subdued until late, only bringing up minor issues with our ability to govern, it has retained influence in the region and has now entered into a clandestine, widespread anti-Reichsstaat propaganda campaign, presumably to influence the locals into insurgency. The campaign, although we are, as of now, unable to stem its flow of propaganda, has been deemed a failure by both myself and my adjutants. Its locations for the placement of propaganda are easily-recognizable and consistent, allowing us to both catch many active dissidents and prevent their works from being seen by the larger population.

Their attack appeared spontaneously, without warning from collaborating Native forces, whom we can therefore assume to be involved. Our local Schutzstaffel units have successfully repelled SWAVO's attempts to seize control of the city centre, and have forced heavy casualties in a victorious delaying action against the insurrection. Unfortunately, in the process, they have lost control over both the city's outskirts and much of the surrounding countryside to the rebels.

SWAVO units were able to induce their chaos across almost the entirety of Windhoek, inducing numerous casualties and reducing Schutzstaffel control to a few fortified locations. The most worrying part of it all, though, were the reactions of Windhoek's native untermensch populace to the rebels' invasion.

Our local intelligence assets have pinpointed the true identity of the Ker as one 'Jaramogi Oginga Odinga', a recognized chieftain of a Luo tribe in the colony's interior. Odinga has been a known dissident since the earliest days of Aryan dominance in Afrika, but his non-violence has led to his activities largely being ignored in the face of more radical, violent dissidence from other local community leaders. Recently, though, the Ker's low-level resistance to the Reichstaat's dominion has escalated, and he has issued a public call for sovereignty for the Luo, and the creation of a "union of the Luo people against the tyrants". Obviously, this is nonsense, and Odinga and his compatriots have no power to resist the Aryan domination of Afrika. The so-called 'Ker' is not a serious threat to our rule, but the thinly veiled treason of Odinga's decree is still enough to warrant an additional show of force in Kenia, to deter sympathy for Odinga's call to action."

Despite the ominous name, all of our intelligence suggests that these so-called brigades are something closer in number to an SS gruppe, consisting of only a handful of 'brigades' of a dozen or so men each. Such a small force is barely worthy of a blip on the radar, and would stand absolutely no chance of offering even piecemeal resistance to Schutzstaffel authority. Owing to this, a plan has been concocted to use the Luo Brigades as a tool of entrapment, allowing the most extreme local separatist elements to coalesce into a single identifiable group, to be purged once the opportunity is right.

Back in 1947, when our administration had not yet solidified, the same dissident we now know as the Ker established an organization called the "Luo Thrift and Trading Corporation". A private company run by Oginga Odinga himself, the purpose of this corporation was to advance the ethnic interests of the Luo tribes, assisting them in establishing businesses and offering financial and technical advice. The corporation was shut down by an SS raid in 1949, when Aryan control over Kenia was tightened, but we have received word that it is now active again, operating in secret inside the region's black market. Between the Ker's sovereignty decree, the Luo Brigades, and now the reemergence of this nationalist organization, it has become apparent that the time for our trap to be sprung is now.

A separatist pirate radio station popular with the untermenschen has made a disturbing edict, announcing the formation of the "Popular Government for Sovereignty": a pretense to a sovereign state, led by Ker Oginga Odinga and a compatriot and known separatist, Achieng Oneko. The Luo Brigades have apparently greatly bolstered in number under our noses, and an upswell of ethnic nationalism has taken sway over the Luo people, under the leadership of their Ker.

The new chair was sturdy and comfortable without being too luxurious, but most importantly it didn't creak. The Statthalter took a moment to enjoy this improvement, and then took a file on top from the massive pile to his right, and in it he found a report by the SS divisions in Bechuanaland detailing the growth of resistance activity in the region and that it is needed more recruits and supplies to tackle the emergency.\n\nHüttig took a glance at the document pile. If his hunch was right, all those other files would contain the same reports, the only thing that would change is where they happened. But after all, he was now in control over a territory that stretched from the Congo Sea to Cape Town, it was only natural that it would take more effort to control it.

After a moment of confusion, Schmidt realized that the fire was expanding to the fields surrounding the now ruined hangar, so he and the few units under his command still alive ran over the trucks and raced as fast as they could from the fire.\n\nWhen the trucks got out of the jungle, Schmidt realized that the situation was much worse than he imagined. The fire expanded to cover the entire vegetation, orange tongues fluttering in the night sky, and the heat could be felt even while standing far from the fire. But at least he didn't have to report that the rebels got away once again, thought Schmidt."

The last resupply was 3 weeks ago, and it was the last time him and his company saw other people. Was this some sort of elaborate punishment for a crime I didn't even commit? HQ somehow couldn't find a good excuse for putting me in front of an execution squad so they sent me wandering across the wilderness for the rest of my days? Meinrad couldn't find an answer to these questions and while part of his brain tried to shrug them off as paranoia, but this only made him more restless.\n\nMeinrad felt that staying still would only make things worse, so, with the excuse of going for a leak, he climbed above a large rock right next to the encampment so that he could have a view of the savanna. As his gaze fell upon the empty grassy expanse, Meinrad suddenly realized that he never saw an animal during his patrols. He never saw any natives, but that was normal given his mission, however not a single wild animal came across his sight. Not a majestic lion, not a swift gazelle, not even a mean little rat or snake appeared during his trips. It was almost as if nature herself was avoiding Meinrad and his team, leaving them alone in the vast emptiness of the savanna. With this realization, Meinrad cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted:\n\n"Helloooo?"\n\nHis comrades, startled by the sudden noise, rushed to Meinrad. His captain grabbed his uniform and shouted:"What are you shouting for, you maniac! What if the enemy notices you!?" Meinrad, nonplussed, simply replied: "What are you talking about captain?"

Yes, it was true, these rebellious partisans crept in every corner and every shadow, ready to tear apart the Reichsstaat and all who reigned over it; and yet, wasn't such a story of partisanship and death so familiar?

This is in order to be certain that the Aryan Boer peoples, oppressed under the rule of natives and Englishmen, are able to experience the inherent freedom of Aryanism. This, however, comes with several responsibilities to the Reichsstaat. It should not be taken as full independence, and such a thing should never be desired.\n\nAs a Vasallenstaat, the foremost responsibility of the Boer peoples is loyalty to the Reichsstaat and the Statthalter-SS, as well as loyalty to National Socialism and the principles that govern all who adhere to it. You are still, for all purposes and functions, peoples of the Reichsstaat and again, must adhere to any and all orders, prohibitions, laws, or requests made of you by the Statthalter-SS.\n\nThis is not to be seen as a restriction of said freedom, but only as the full realization of the freedom and power granted to the Aryan race. After all, only weak men see freedom as the power to act as one wishes. That is hedony and laziness, and it is a form of slavery to the desires of man. The only way for an Aryan to be truly free, is to freely choose a life of strength, Spartanism, and obedience. And as members of the Vasallenstaat, all of you are to be held to the same standard.\n\nMay National Socialism burn in your hearts forever!"

They had found out that the South African Army had information about OFN intervention. They were especially interested in the complex plans devised between high-ranking members of both the SAA and the armies of the OFN. The intelligence was saved in documents and recordings across South Africa, and Hüttig's men wanted every single one.\n\nHe didn't speak to the SS soldiers that flanked him as he was pushed and prodded into entering his own office. They figured snarls and rifles were enough to force him to obey - and, as it turned out, Jabulani valued his life more than the notion of resistance. All that would get him would be a bullet in his head. When he fuddled for his keys and got the door open, he could see his office riddled with paperwork and drawers fit to be opened. Jabulani wanted to speak out, but there was nothing to say as the soldiers that were there to guard him suddenly moved past, beginning to ravage through everything in the room.\n\nNervousness swelled through him. What would happen to him, now that they had all they needed? He got the opportunity to see the camps. So many starved faces there-- he didn't want to join them. But before Jabulani even began thinking about the opportunity to run, he could hear the two SS men exchange a short conversation in German, and during his time in the war there was a single word he learned that was ingrained into his memory.\n\nAs Jabulani turned to run, one of the SS raised their rifle and sprayed three rounds, one hitting the waist, one the stomach, and one the chest.

It was alleged by Sturmbannführer Weber that Unterscharführer Schneider, a member of my division, was considering desertion, and eventual emigration to Madagascar. This is false. The letter Weber submitted as evidence was revealed to be, upon my own investigation, a forgery. This was confirmed by Sturmbannführer Weber upon questioning.\n\nIt was further alleged that Schneider ideated upon suicide or desertion, and that his fellow SS men attempted to intimidate him by threatening the safety of his family. This is also false. Sturmbannführer Weber admitted that the former claim was a lie concocted to diminish Schneider's reputation and that he threatened Schneider's family by sending intimidating letters to their home at 22 Rommelstraße, Quelimane.\n\nThe final and most severe allegation is that Schneider had been stripped naked and thrown into a labor camp by his fellow SS men, and torn to pieces by the natives contained there. This is completely false. Schneider was killed in an ambush in Ruanda. The state of his remains was due to the savage practices of the Luba people, who practice cannibalism."

Had it not been for the road signs hardly changing names or the pair of natives that hung from the lamp posts, Hans would have sworn he was exactly where he had started his patrol. Peering down the empty street, Hans could only make out the faint silhouette of another soldier, dragging his feet over the concrete sidewalk which stood 4 feet wider than it had any right to be. Hans stopped himself again. \n\n"I don't think I can do this anymore." Turning around to speak with Klopfer, Hans found himself confronted with the road that stretched beyond the horizon, the concrete on either side of it, and nothing else."

 GRO_REICHSSTAAT_FOCUS.57.desc:0 "The damp tents which lined the inside of the concrete hovel shuddered with activity as the sun rose over the horizon and peered into the holes in the wall that could generously be called "windows". It certainly didn't end there for the camp which Ajani and his son found themselves in. The camp as a whole seemed to work off of concepts rather than firm ideas. There were no washrooms, only holes. There weren't any kind of doors, so much as burnt grass that stood in the frames. Not so much meals as there was an occasional scrap of something to eat sprinkled throughout the week, and even then more than half of that went to Ajani's son. How the soldiers hadn't found him was beyond Ajani, but it was clear that with every passing day their eyes were growing just as faded as Ajani, their hatred losing prominence, their punches and kicks losing veracity with each passing day, and not for lack of rations, though that too was certainly a factor. As if their routine checks of the concrete "room" weren't growing infrequent enough, they were hardly checking beyond a quick glance anymore. Ajani's son hidden in the folds of the collapsed tent during the day was more than enough to keep him hidden, not that it could count for much if he simply lived to suffer. As much was why Azani had spent his work shifts whispering to the other men, their numbers thinning by the day. Somewhere, at night, there was a tunnel being dug deeper by the day. It had gotten so deep that it simply couldn't be hidden anymore, but the guards hadn't bothered to care. They'd either assumed they were digging more graves, digging a new washroom, or just knew what they were trying, and figured they'd get the head start on one of the former two. \n\nAjani knew he couldn't let his son stay here, not with how quickly the numbers of those in the camp were dwindling. After all, if they were suffering only to be shot, what was it all for?"

Had it not been for the burn pits raging behind him or the gentle glow of the lanterns surrounding the camp fences, the view of the scorched fields surrounding the camp would have been completely unidentifiable. Klaus could hardly recognize the land as it was or the faces of his comrades anymore. The warm light of the pits was all that Klaus' eyes were adjusted for, after all, and it seemed that the feeling was growing mutual. During the day, nobody could claim to focus on each other in the least, concerning themselves more with the task at hand. For Klaus, that meant execution duty. Klaus took his shift in the pits as a reprieve, however. Every moment he was staring into the eyes of a dying man meant a moment not staring into those of a man he knew or a man he had gotten to know and respect, growing weaker with age and despair. \n\nThat night, looking out over the burnt rust-colored earth finally beginning to recede into darkness, Klaus sat down on the wooden boxes that had made up his easy chair for surveilling the same patches of land he had for the last few months. Perhaps he dozed to sleep not long after, perhaps he stared out at the decaying earth for hours on end. \n\nThe light itself was blinding, taking him a few moments to adjust as it was pulled away. Looking up at the man who had held it, a face he couldn't recognize reached out its hand to him. Taking it, Klaus heaved himself up and found himself face to face with what must have been a man. Even still, his nose was drooping down, and his skin was tightly wound around his cheekbones. His eyes were sunken, though the bags underneath gave them a paradoxically widened look. The hand which held the lantern was nearing upon skeletal in nature, and his hair was held to his scalp in sporadic tufts rather than anything of a cohesive nature. Pointing out towards the field, he spoke in a raspy, detached voice."

Förschner peered out of the corner of his eye at the aide, trying to keep up. \n\n"No, herr Förschner, equipment failure. Some hours en route to a local village, the lead truck simply shut down, engine failure. With that, the soldiers tried carrying on only for the event to repeat another few times. The mission was deemed unsalvageable, they turned around, and started running out of trucks. They radioed for evacuation, which we received, informed them of their situation, and they decided on suicide." Förschner nodded and felt a bitterness sting his throat. \n\n"I see.

The ashes laid themselves on the twiddling thumbs of the Reichskommissar, stirring him from his thoughts. His chauffeur turned his head to him, his cap hardly hiding his poor state, only doing so much as to hide his sunken eyes. Stepping out of the car, Hüttig walked just off the dirt road, and into the fields of burnt grass. The embers crackled as he walked over the smoldering ash piles, the smoke rising from a small collection of trees which had yet to be fully rendered. Hüttig looked across the field. He let out another breath, bringing in smoke and debris to his lungs as he breathed in. \n\nThe drive back was deathly quiet. Hüttig thought back to the burning fields, then the first camps in what was once Zentralafrika, then Südwestafrika. The first camps in Büchenwald. The thoughts of the smokestacks filled his mind, and he felt a naggin reminder hit him. He should have, by all means, stopped earlier. And yet, here he was, championing the National Socialist cause, no matter what stood in his way. Really, he had become one of the few remaining pioneers of National Socialism which still graced the earth. Even still, Hüttig could not help but think he was working to the end of no given destination. Not that it was all for nothing, but that his reasoning for even attempting to bother with Africa was a fool's errand. At that moment, Hüttig felt a tingling in the back of his throat.

Their orders to exterminate, to cleanse, to burn.\n\nBrigadeführer Lachmann would only look ahead, out the front of the run-down motorcade he had driven around, ghoulishly following the troops into whatever populated spaces remained, reminding them of their orders, and then simply watching as the massacre unfolded. Huttig had given him these orders, he would follow them as his duty as a soldier demanded.\n\nYet the miniscule rational part of him, screaming from the back of his mind was trying to tell him what he was doing was rotten, and achieved nothing for the German people but more violence, devastation, and agony. His cold, uncaring exterior didn't betray it, but in this part of his mind, he knew National Socialism had failed, utterly and completely.\n\nHe simply chose not to care, and continued doing what he was told.

The truck driver only made it more difficult; the shock from each shell-forged pothole sent an electric bolt up Van's spine, teasing at an old bullet wound. The soldiers in the back had enough lead in them to tip a magazine half-full, and they were all looking out to where they last saw Pretoria, wishing they had never held a gun before. Not if doing so meant they were once more meant for the Reichstaat. There was still so much more to see. There had to be more than just a view from the back of a truck.\n\nThey passed into the blasted no man's land between South Africa and the Reichstaat, where more mercury than water sat in the soil. The trees were all dead from chlorine, and every hill hid a gassed man with melted lungs. The soldiers saw a native trying to dig a half-buried man - maybe his brother - out of a collapsed trench. The last they saw of him, he'd gotten him out. The last they heard of him was a muffled boom strangled by a rocky rise.\n\nThe soldiers all looked at each other - at their wounds, at their scars. They nodded. Nothing needed to be said. One knocked on the back of the tractor and demanded a short stop so they could all relieve themselves. They filed out with guns drawn. Two men from Mondustria blocked the pockmarked road, and a ranger from Eersterust hauled the driver out, stood him in a ditch, and shot him dead.

Claiming to represent the legitimate continuation of Hüttig's state, he employs the same methods used by his predecessor, though how could a splinter faction from a rogue colony claim anything resembling legitimacy remains a mystery.\n\nFor us, this means the end of any dream of restoring German influence over Africa.

 GRO_REICHSSTAAT_REICH.7.desc:0 "Today, the inevitable has happened. Despite his boisterous proclamations, everyone knew Hans Hüttig would never have been able to keep almost half of Africa under his boot: with only a handful of fanatical loyalists and a dilapidated economy, it was only a matter of time before his castle in the air came crashing down.\n\nFor months, native revolts increased in frequency and intensity, uncaring of the rabid retaliations, inflicting devastating losses on the overstretched SS patrols. City after city blacked out, road after road was taken, and with every passing day the grip tightened on the besieged administration in Quelimane, but still the madman would claim that everything would be returned under control with the appropriate amount of mass executions.\n\nNow, we know for certain that the sun - black or not - has definitely set over the Grossafrikanischer Reichsstaat. Aerial reconnaissance reports that Quelimane is aflame, and no sign can be found of Hans Hüttig and his closest advisors. On the other hand, the Reichskanzlei received a call from the phone of the administrative compound of Lèopoldville that once hosted the Zentralafrikaner administration, thought long since abandoned. Apparently, it has been occupied by the officers and administrators of the Cabal, who have managed to gather enough loyal troops to occupy the city and surrounding area before the collapse of Hüttig's administration, swearing their loyalty to our government and proclaiming the restoration of German rule in Africa.\n\nFor us, this is welcome news. While the dream of a large colonial empire in the Dark Continent is all but vanished, the Cabal enclave is strong enough to resist attacks until a proper colonial garrison arrives, and from it we can at least project our influence in the chaos that has become Central Africa, hoping to reap at least a part of its bountiful resources for the Reich."

As competent as his handling of the Reichministry for Foreign Affairs had been, the stress of war did not treat Walther Hewel kindly. Bormann hoped the man would grow a spine and stand up straight by the time they marched back into Germania.\n\n"What is it, Reichsminister?" Bormann snapped, slowing his pace. "I have a meeting with Burgdorf and Wenck. Spit it out."\n\n"Reports from Afrika," Hewel responded, shuffling his documents awkwardly. The Reichsminister noticed Bormann's stony expression and continued with a cough. "Reichskommissar Hüttig has seized control over the entirety of our Afrikan territory. He declared himself the ruler of the 'Großafrikaner Reichsstaat'. His loyalty is currently..."\n\n"Nonexistent," Bormann growled. "His loyalty is fucking nonexistent. That man spent the last decade heiling Hitler in public and Heydrich in private. Himmler is behind these machinations, I can fucking assure you. Give those documents to Klopfer."\n\nBormann stomped on, head swimming with thoughts. As if things weren't complicated enough. No matter. It was but a single raindrop in the storm of chaos that had befallen the Aryan race. Only when he stood before the Reichstag in triumph could his mind turn to such matters."

Whether that scent of blood tantalized him with a taste of imminent victory, or warned of an inbound threat, Reinhardt Heydrich would not rest until he knew everything there was to know about that blood he scented.\n\nAnd once again, Heydrich smelled blood. Hüttig's Reichsstaat came as a surprise to even him. Naught had been forewarned to him. Not the Reichsführer-SS, not the Ostland-SD, and not even his own trusted informants had granted him any forewarning of this seemingly monumental SS operation to overtake the Afrikan Reichskommissariats. How could he have possibly been left in the dark to find out along with the rest?\n\nHeydrich nose twitched.

Always one to stand out amongst a crowd, he wore his beloved pearl white military uniform as per usual, bearing the exclusive rank of Reichsmarschall granted to him decades ago. The usual comings and goings of the wartime workday were cut short however, when an Oberst from intelligence ran into the room, his uniform wrinkled and damp with sweat. The mumbling and plotting that usually rings through the air of the Führer's war room suddenly ceased, as all eyes shot towards the sudden and unceremonious entry of the officer.\n\nWithout so much as a salute to his Führer who stood before him, the man spoke. "Hans Hüttig, he's broken off--" he paused to breathe "he has declared his own state. The Großafrikaner Reichsstaat, he's been calling it."\n\n"That's impossible, he has long since declared his loyalty to Germania!" replied Göring with a sharp and uncontrolled yell, turning away from the maps of Germany in front of him.\n\n"Mein Führer, Hüttig is nothing short of mad. He himself has likely forgotten the loyalties he declared yesterday morning, let alone the loyalties he declared years ago." chimed in Generalfeldmarschall Schörner, standing opposite of the Führer at the map table.\n\nHis quick flare of temper having cooled, Göring turned his attention back to the exhausted Oberst. "Any word of Reichskommissar Schenck? Müller? Surely they are not a part of this lunatic's gambit?".\n\n"We... do not know, Mein Führer, yet intelligence suggests that they may face a hostile takeover attempt from Hüttig's SS in the coming days. We cannot establish contact with anybody of significant rank in Africa. We cannot verify..." the Oberst trailed off, at a loss for words for his Führer and still attempting to regain his breath.\n\nShooting a look of dread to his generals, Göring returned his attention to the maps in front of him. "Thank you Oberst, that will be all. We will approach the issue when our hands are free."

After a few hours, the two thousand men of "Abteilung Wolfgang Schenck" paraded through the streets, before departing for Johannesburg the next morning. Meanwhile, the naval personnel set about refurbishing the abandoned Simonstown naval base for use by the Kriegsmarine.\n\nAt the same time as the highly publicized arrival of German troops in the Boer Republic takes place, Luftwaffe transport planes continue to arrive at the Leopoldville Airport, delivering over twenty thousand troops over the course of a week. These brave sons of the Reich will serve as the guardians of the much reduced Zentralafrika administration, ensuring that no local power will ever dare attempt an attack against it.\n\nAt OKW headquarters, there is much rejoicing: The Reich's presence in the Dark Continent has been re-established, ensuring a major propaganda victory for the regime, which can now effectively claim that victory in The South African War was indeed worth the price."

Deutsche Bank stocks were soaring after it was revealed that the Boer government had nationalized the DeBeers mining corporation, formerly property of "notorious Jew Harry Oppenheimer," and then rapidly sold it to the "Deutsch-Afrikanische Bergbaugesellschaft," itself a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, and by extension, of Hermann J. Abs.\n\nHowever, Abs was far from the only one making his move: Already Mercedes cars were becoming the preferred (and indeed, the only) choice of South African motorists. Siemen's stocks too, were up, as orders to standardize the Boer government's electronic machines proved a major boost. In Kongo, the return of the corporations had provoked an economic boom, as ties with Katanga were reestablished and profits from managing hydropower returned.\n\nThe report concluded with a reassuring statement to the effect that, even if the corporate bugmen themselves were reprehensible, their newfound sources of profits would trickle down back to the Reich's economy, and the government's coffers.\n\nThe Fuhrer put the memorandum away with a smile on his face: There could be such a thing as a good day in politics."

Today, he didn't need a drink, he was already ecstatic about the victory. All of those fools in Germania who always told him he couldn't do it, they weren't laughing now!
