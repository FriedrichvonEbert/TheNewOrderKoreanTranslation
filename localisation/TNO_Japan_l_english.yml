 POLITICS_HIROYA_INO_DESC:0 "이노 히로야는 그리 인기있는 사람은 아닙니다. 본디 제국의회의 하원의원에 불과했던 이노는 스스로 토조 히데키, 후에는 그의 정치적 라이벌인 키도 코이치를 제거하기 위해 일본 정계의 복잡한 사안들을 능숙하게 처리했습니다. 하지만 일이 그렇게 쉽게 풀리지만은 않는 법. 그 정치적 야수들을 무찌르기 위해, 이노는 약간의 뒷거래를 성사시켜야만 했습니다. 그리 약간은 아니지만요. 그리고 그런 연줄들이 처음에는 꽤나 쓸만해 보였지만, 이노의 채무는 계속 쌓여갔고, 그는 일본 국민들보다도 다양하고 특별한 이해관계를 위해 일하게 되었습니다.\n\n이노는 제정 체제의 충실한 신봉자이며, 모든 정치적 논의의 최상위에 천황 폐하를 두기를 원합니다. 이노의 정당인 대정익찬회는 일본 유일의 합법정당이며, 다양한 이념을 가진 의원들의 넓은 연정을 아우르지만 천황 폐하의 옥좌를 의회의 난잡한 정치적인 문제들로부터 안전하고 확실하게 지켜냄으로서 유지될 수 있습니다. 그러나, 이노는 그의 정당에 대한 통제를 빠르게 잃고 있으며 그가 내각총리대신직에서 물러나는 것은 불가피해보입니다.\n\n제국의회의 많은 이들은 그가 토조와 키도를 무찌른 것과 같은 방식으로 이노가 물러나기를 바라며, 이는 일본 정계에서 줄곧 자신의 유의미한 위치를 지켜온 키도의 소망이기도 합니다. 만일 이노가 그의 이념을 지켜내고 파벌을 생존시키기를 원한다면, 그는 다시 한번 일본의 어두컴컴한 정계 속에서 안전한 그의 길을 찾아내야 할 것입니다. 마치 그가 과거에 수없이 그랬던 것처럼." 
 POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "다이쇼 시대에 쌓이고 쌓였던 정치적 불안들로부터 불사조가, 황국의 권위가 날아올랐사옵니다. 천황 폐하, 일본의 신성한 통치자, 히로히토 덴노께서. 지난 40년 동안 일본은 태평양의 신출내기 제국으로부터 지구상에서 가장 거대한 대양의 실질적인 지배자가 되었사옵니다. 그 최상위에는 그 분께서 계시옵나이다. 태양의 여신 아마테라스의 후손이자 야마토의 자랑스러운 아들께서.\n\n1901년 4월 21일에 태어나신 히로히토 황자께서는 다이쇼 천황의 네 아드님 중 맏이이셨사옵니다. 1921년에 받아들이신 섭정직은 이후 폐하의 통치에 영감을 주었사옵나이다. 천황 폐하께서는 1926년 옥좌를 물려받으사오며, 폐하의 갈수록 군국주의화되어가는 제국을 이끄시어 만주의 이권을 얻어내시고 그 뒤에는 중국 전역을, 그리고 결국에는 태평양에 존재하는 서구의 모든 자산을 지배하시게 되셨사옵나이다.\n\n대동아전쟁의 종결과 함께, 열강으로서의 일본의 지위는 굳건해졌사옵니다. 다대한 양의 영토 획득은 황국에 막대한 부를 불러왔으며 신성한 폐하의 황권을 강화하였사옵니다. 폐하께서는 이제 공무로부터 완전이 손을 떼시었사오며 전화선 너머의 칙령으로만 폐하의 노복들과 소통하실 뿐이시옵나이다. 쇼와 시대의 천황으로서, 폐하의 제국은 흔들리고 있사옵니다. 곧, 거대한 변화가 찾아올 것이며 황국을 그 기반에서부터 흔들 것이옵나이다. 신민들이 과연 신성한 천황 폐하 외의 그 무엇에 의지할 수 있겠사옵나이까?"
 POLITICS_TAKAGI_SOUKICHI_DESC:0 "타카기 소키치는 얼핏 보면 전혀 관계가 없을 것 같은 두 개의 주된 지지기반을 가지고 있습니다: 학생 운동가들과 대일본제국 해군입니다. 타카기와 같은 그러한 이질적인 지지층을 유지할 수 있는 사람은 거의 없을 테지요. 그리고 약간의 조사와 함께 이는 더더욱 확실해집니다. 그가 처음에는 반대했던 태평양 전쟁에서의 유명한 전과를 통하여 타카기 제독은 대일본제국 해군(과 지속적인 자금 제공)의 강한 지지자가 되었습니다. 그의 많은 임무들 중에서 가장 특기할 만한 것은 진주만의 핵 투하를 도왔던 항모전단을 이끈 것이었지요.\n\n또한 타카기는 각각 경제를 자유화하고 사회적 자유를 확장하고 싶어하는 제국의회의 개혁파 의원들과 학생 운동가들의 지원을 받습니다. 학생들에게 다카기는 자유로운 미래와 표현의 자유를 상징합니다. 의원들에게 그는 일본의 경제 문제에 대한 절실한 해결책입니다.\n\n사실 타카기의 지지율은 보이는 것처럼 안정적이진 않습니다. 누가 지휘권을 가지고 있든, 대일본제국 해군만이 그들이 육군보다 우선이 되는 한 힘이 될 수 있으며 운동가들은 파벌주의로 악명이 높습니다. 만일 그가 태평양의 바다에서 그랬던 것처럼 일본 정계를 헤쳐나갈 수 있는 사람이고, 그가 이루기를 원하는 개혁들을 도입한다면, 일본의 미래는 당연히 떠오르는 태양처럼 밝게 빛날 것입니다."
 POLITICS_KIDO_KOUICHI_DESC:0 "많은 사람들은 키도 코이치는 이미 내각총리대신으로서의 기회를 날려버렸다고 말합니다. 도조 히데키에 대항해서 이노 히로야와 함께 감행한 정치 쿠데타로 인하여 총리직을 물려받았을 때, 키도는 처음에는 엄청난 인기를 구가했습니다. 이 인기는 키도의 실질적인 카리스마나 역량에서 나온 것이 아니었으며 단지 그가 도조가 아니라는 간단한 사실에서 나왔습니다.\n\n이노가 의회의 지지를 얻어 그를 대체하기 전까지 키도는 수많은 이익단체들을 이용하여 그를 잘라버릴 기회가 있었습니다. 이노가 같은 구덩이에 빠졌을 때, 키도는 다시 권력으로 복귀했습니다. 그리고 이제 그는 돌아옸으며, 제국의회는 왜 그들이 이전에 키도를 제거하길 바랐는지를 깨닫기 시작했습니다.\n\n이런 때의 키도의 몇 안 되는 장점은 그가 천황 폐하와 가까운 관계라는 것일지 모릅니다. 제2차 세계대전과 그 이후에도 키도는 천황 폐하의 가장 가까운 조언가로서 폐하를 모셨고 옥좌의 영예를 지키는 가장 중요한 임무를 계속해서 맡아왔습니다. 그러나 계속해서 멀어지는 천황 폐하와 제국의회와의 관계로 인하여 키도는 그의 우위를 잃을 지도 모릅니다.\n\n키도 코이치에게 있어서 이러한 정치적 위기에서 살아남는 것은 그가 이전에 했던 같은 실수를 예방했다는 것을 의미합니다. 경험이 가치있는 것인 한, 과거는 그 무엇보다도 좋은 미래 예언이 될 수 있습니다."
 POLITICS_IKEDA_MASANOSUKE_DESC:0 "일본인들 대다수는 이케다 마사노스케가 내각총리대신이 되리라고 생각하지 않았습니다. 그러나 그들은 이케다만큼의 통찰력이 없었지요. 보수주의자이자 충실한 친-이노파인 이케다는 역사적으로 최고이자 최악이었던 보수들의 본능을 상징합니다. 극단주의를 미심쩍어하고 급작스러운 변화에 회의적인 새로운 내각총리대신은 일본 정치의 현재 상태를 유지하기를 원합니다.\n\n물론 이케다가 이노 시절의 다양한 실패를 보지 못한 것은 아닙니다. 도덕성의 부재와 부패는 일본이라는 국가에 많은 금이 가게 만들었습니다. 자이바츠와 대일본제국군, 그리고 정부와의 안정적이었던 관계는 깨졌습니다. 이는 건강한 일본을 보고 싶을 리 없을 야심가들과 음모자들, 기회주의자들과 다른 여러 종류의 득 될 것 없는 인간들을 그 폐허로부터 행운을 감별해내도록 만들었습니다. 국회에 대한 대중의 믿음은 이노의 사임 이후에 나타난 대정익찬회의 추악스러운 분열의 몰골로 인하여 흔들렸습니다. 화족들은 정계에서의 그들의 파트너들에 대한 믿음을 잃었습니다. 이 모든 것을 통하여 외국인 관찰자들은 더 약한 일본을 기대하면서 그들의 칼을 갈고 있습니다. 이 모든 것은 고쳐져야 합니다.\n\n날 때부터 정치과학자였고 직업상 신문 편집자였던 이케다는 단 한 번도 모든 정부의 어두운 구석탱이에 굴러다니는 때나 찌꺼기들에게 순진하게 굴었던 적이 없었습니다. 이제, 그는 그가 10년 동안 살았던 집을 스스로 치워야 한다는 어려운 과제를 마주하고 있습니다. 친-이노파 보수주의자들과 자유주의자, 그리고 무소속 의원들의 얇은 연정은 그의 모든 움직임을 하나하나 면밀히 관찰합니다. 그러나 그가 아니면 과연 누가 할 수 있을까요? 일본은 전쟁 이후 맞이했던 그의 가장 어두운 시간으로부터 빠져나와야 하며, 그리고 이케다는 그가 극단주의에 맞서는 유일한 방패라는 것을 알고 있습니다." 
 POLITICS_KAYA_OKINORI_DESC:0 "카야 오키노리는 숫자를 좋아합니다. 하지만 사람들은 딱히 좋아하지도 싫어하지도 않지요. 최소한 이는 일본 대중들이 이 관료 정치인을 처음으로 보았을 때 느꼈을 첫 감정이었을 것입니다. 일본 경제를 총력전을 위해 만들어진 기계로 탈바꿈시킬 수 있는 그의 능력은 그의 지위를 눈에 띄게 높여놓았습니다. 지루할 때 나오는 그의 단순하고 쾌활한 성격은 그를 위협으로 느끼지 않게 만들었습니다. 결과적으로, 많은 혁신관료들은 키도 코이치가 권력을 잃게 되었을 때 카야를 지도자로 만들었습니다.\n\n사람보다 숫자를 더 좋아하는 카야의 성격에도 불구하고 그는 그 자신이 경이로운 협상가임을 증명했습니다. 군이 키도를 권력에서 내쫓기 위하여 그를 온갖 방법으로 가로막는 것을 보고, 카야는 그가 그의 전임자와 같은 실수를 행하지 않기로 결심했습니다. 결과적으로, 관료들은 천천히, 그리고 조심스럽게 군부의 환심을 샀습니다. 한때 군부가 혁신관료들의 급진적인 계획들에 매우 분노하고 불신했을 때, 카야 오키노리는 그 계획이 그들의 이익을 지켜줄 것이라고 설득하는데 성공했습니다. 결과적으로, 혁신관료들은 군부가 가장 좋아하는 파벌로서 보수주의자들을 대체했습니다. 이 지지는 카야가 가장 높은 자리로 올라가는 것을 도왔으며, 이제 혁신관료들은 일본의 경로를 바꾸는 실탄이 되었습니다.\n\n카야 오키노리는 사람보다 숫자를 좋아하며 일본 정계에서 가장 강력한 파벌의 지도자라는 갑작스러운 역할은 그가 쉽게 채울 수 있는 것이 아닙니다. 새로운 내각총리대신은 따라서 그의 파벌 멤버들에게 의존해야 합니다. 그러나 수면 아래에서는 혁신 관료들 간의 정책에서의 의견 일치는 생각보다 허약한 것일지도 모릅니다. 카야 오키노리는 그의 조언가들이 제정신을 차리고 그가 성취할 수 있는 목표를 이룰 수 있도록 돕기를 바랍니다. 뭐, 정부에 완전히 종속된 사회를 만드는 그 옛날 혁신관료들의 목표로 돌아가는 것은 생각치도 못한 결과를 불러올 수도 있지만요." 
 POLITICS_KAKUEI_TANAKA_DESC:0 "모든 일본 아이들은 '유능한 매는 그 발톱을 숨긴다'라는 속담을 알고 있습니다. 이제는 일본의 내각총리대신이자 일본 정계의 언제나 '어둠의 쇼군'인, 한때 대정익찬회의 떠오르는 다크호스였던 타나카 카쿠에이는 도덕을 가슴에 새기며 법정공방과 높으신 분들을 구워삶는 데에 탁월한 능력을 발휘했습니다. 거대한 부패 스캔들로 점철된 그의 경력 속에서 타나카는 그가 갖고 있는 자이바츠, 그리고 강력한 정당 내 단체들과의 중요한 연결고리와 함께 그의 야망을 위하여 열심히 일했습니다. 그가 몸을 담고 있는 체제로부터 환영받는 일이 없었던 타나카가 내각총리대신의 자리에 오르는 것은 뜻밖의 일이었고 어쩌면 일본 대중들에게는 부당할지도 모르지만, 대정익찬회의 총신들이 계속되는 경제적 갈등에 있어서 무능함을 내비치고 그들의 거대한 계획들이 복잡한 일본 정계의 현실 앞에서 박살나자, 그 빈 자리가 믿을 수 없는 작자들인 자이바츠들의 손으로 넘어가는 데에는 오래 걸리지 않았습니다.\n\n일본 화족가들로부터 사랑을 듬뿍받는 내각총리대신 타나카 카쿠에이는 세계대전이 끝나고 난 뒤 일본에 정착한 자이바츠들과 케이레츠들 간의 경제적 이중체제를 (물론, 전자에 호의적이게) 끝내고 자이바츠들의 우위를 공고히 하는 것 외에는 추구하는 것이 없습니다. 자이바츠들의 돈과 지역개발사업을 통하여 자신의 길을 개척하는 타나카는 그러나 평범한 일본인들의 애원을 잊지 않으며 자기 자신을 서민 정치인이라고 꾸미는 것을 잊지 않습니다. 타나카는 일본 노동자들에게 근심걱정 없는 삶을 제공하고 단 5년 내에 그들의 임금을 두 배로 올려줄 일본의 새로운 시대를 약속합니다. 실패한다면, 타나카는 스스로 권력에서 내려올 것입니다." 
 POLITICS_KONOE_FUMIMARO_DESC:0 "고노에 후미마로 공작은 많은 희망속에 태어났습니다. 후지와라 가문에서 귀족으로서 자랐고, 외교부에서 중요한 역할을 수행했으며, 천황이 직접 수여하는 신성한 훈장을 받았습니다. 옛질서의 산물인 고노에 공작은 사려깊은만큼 혈기왕성한 사람이었습니다. 그의 매력은 한때 언론을 현혹시켰고, 어떤 이들은 그가 여전히 매력으로 빛난다고 말합니다. 1937년 수상이 되면서 고노에는 거침없는 출세가도를 달릴 것처럼 보였지만, 고노에조차 일본 내 정치세력들을 통제할 수 없었습니다. 노구교사건이 연이은 군사적 모험으로 발전하면서 미소띤 공작은 자신의 당과 내각에 대한 통제력을 잃었고, 이는 자아도취에 빠진 군국주의자들을 유발했습니다. 일부는 그가 여전히 강제 퇴진과 장기집권이라는 뿌리깊은 치욕을 은연중에 지니고 있다고 말합니다.\n\n중일전쟁에 대한 그의 걱정은 일련의 사건들로 옳다는게 증명되었지만, 미래는 고노에에게 호의적이지 않았습니다. 대부분의 사람들은 그를 일본의 아들들이 불꽃과 불길속에 외국 땅에서 죽어갈때 지켜보기만 했던 사람으로 기억하며, 아무것도 하지 않았다고 봅니다. 이제 고노에를 공직에서 몰아낸 바로 그 당이 고노에를 가장 절망적인 자리에 앉혔고, 세월은 그의 씁쓸함을 더 짙게 했습니다. 그러나 이는 또한 그의 시야를 맑게 해주었고, 그의 눈은 변하지 않았습니다. 최근의 사건들은 그를 흔들지 못했고, 오히려 옛질서를 다시 세워야 한다고 그를 깨우쳤을 뿐입니다. 그를 배신한 당과 잃어버린 제국은 반드시 그가 바라던 일본이라는 질서있는 교향곡에 엮어져 있어야 합니다. 일본은 이 균형을 위협하는 사람들에 의해 무너졌지만, 이를 복구하는데 공작보다 적임자가 있을까요? 고노에는 무슨 수를 써서라도 해낼 것입니다. 후지와라 가문은 단 한 번만 실패합니다. 다시는 실패하지 않을 것입니다."
 POLITICS_KISHI_NOBUSUKE_DESC:0 "악마는 디테일에 있다고 하지만, 대일본제국에서 악마는 북서쪽에 있습니다. 직업관료이자, 산업의 기수이자, 제국의 가장 공포스러운 남자, 기시 노부스케입니다. 부유한 기시 가문에 들어가기 위해 생물학적 가족을 버린 노부스케는 똑똑하고 유능하며, 가장 중요한건 권력을 위해서라면 무자비하다는 것입니다. 그가 만주국의 핵심 관료로서 정치적 명성을 떨치기 전엔 이념적 스펙트럼이 진자처럼 이리저리 오갔습니다.\n\n기시에게 만주국은 건설할 나라가 아니었습니다. 그 땅은 정체성과 인간성이 결여된 땅이었습니다. 4천만의 인구는 제국의 지배를 위한 원자재에 불과했습니다. 수많은 이 "원자재"들은 하얼빈 제철단지의 높이 솟은 굴뚝 아래에서 일하고 그 자리에서 죽어갑니다. 이 모든걸 이용해 기시는 관동군과 동료 관료, 사업가들과 유착하면서 만주국에서 부패와 불행의 끝없고 복잡미묘한 연결망을 형성해 왔습니다. 기시는 자산, 현금, 복종, 존경 등 사람이 원하는 모든 것을 가진것처럼 보입니다. 그러나 기시는 아직 만족하지 않았습니다.\n\n기시의 야망은 만주국에서 힘겹게 구축한 체제를 본토로 이식하는 것입니다. 그의 후원 하에 제국은 아시아 태평양을 지배하는 기업주의적이고 잔인하며 전체주의인 국방 국가로 진화할 것입니다. 모든 것은 국체를 위해 헌신할 것입니다. 모든 것은 국가를 위해 헌신할 것입니다. 나약한 대정익찬회로부터 기시가 권력의 고삐를 잡아당기는걸 막을 방법은 없습니다."

In particular, Aomori prefecture has received record-breaking snowfalls exceeding 1200 centimetres, with a depth exceeding 150 centimetres. All across Japan, individual charity initiatives through word of mouth, religious organisations as well as political associations went on a charity offensive - calling for snowfall relief equipment and necessity donations.\n\nThe prefectural government, for all intents and purposes, seems to be overwhelmed by the natural disaster that has fallen upon Aomori. We've received a barrage of phone calls and telegrams from the prefecture, and the Ministry of Transport and Communications, in charge of Japan's meteorological research has called upon the counsel of the Prime Minister.\n\nWhen snowfall hits, standard excavation and recovery vehicles are used - tractors, snow ploughs as well as civilian volunteers who dig through the snow with shovels. This is standard operating procedure for the government, but the central government would take several days to mobilise the proper equipment for the task. Of note however, is a proposal from Aomori's regional military commander - a call to mobilise the prefecture's reserve units and clear the snow with military hardware, but we should heavily consider the consequences of such a call."

As Kenzou exhaled, his breath instantly turned to mist in front of him, and even while wearing gloves, his fingers were growing numb and losing sensation. He had no choice however, but to trudge on.\n\nKenzou clutched his spade tightly as he stared at the large snowy mound in front of him. It was tall, reaching up to his chest. He tapped it lightly, to which it did not budge at the slightest. Gritting his teeth, Kenzou moved his shovel to and fro as pieces of ice and dirt brushed his face. Several minutes later, the once towering pile of snow lay in pieces by his feet. Smirking weakly, Kenzou leaned against a nearby wall to recover. Half of his strength was exhausted on that one mound, what more the rest? As Kenzou tried to catch his breath, a young lady walked up to him, carrying some hot water. "Here." she said, passing a cup to Kenzou. "You'll need it. You've got a tough job ahead of you, but you're doing well. Keep it up." remarked the girl as she twirled around to head back.\n\n"Th- Thank you!" replied Kenzou sheepishly. He was unsure if the lady heard his reply, but it didn't matter now. Sipping on the water, Kenzou felt its warmth spreading throughout his body, his sense of touch returning as it loosened his frozen joints. He laughed mildly, and grabbed his shovel once more.

With every blast of the nozzle, bursts of fiery inferno spewed from the tanks mounted on the soldier's back and over twenty meters ahead of him. The air around the observers grew thicker and a feverish blush flushed through their sweaty bodies every time the trigger was pulled to cremate the targets. Examiners ticked off checklists and recorded video evidence of the experiment's success whilst squad members heckled cheers of approval to the troop testing out the weapon, both thrilled to see the potential ravaging of war.\n\nThe geared-up soldier glanced back at the observing troops and officers with a smile, signalling his approval and joy with a firm thumbs-up, before reinforcing his stance to blast more of the blazing streams across the fields to scorch the grass and blacken the targets."

Those who cower during the day crawl out of their comfort zones at night, and "Aka" Nakajima is no different. Lighting a cigarette, Aka heaves and leans back into his precious Midori.\n\nBut Midori is no schoolmate, neither is she a courtesan. Midori moans louder than any girlfriend Aka's had, and Aka could ride her for hours, or as much as he pleases.\n\nAll there is now is silence, until the familiar hums of other engines come within his earshot. The three-rev roar was familiar - it was Ryu and the boys from Setagaya. Coolly taking another drag from his cigarette, Aka gestures warmly to the older man.\n\n"How's that scar treating you, you magnificent Mongol-slayer!"\n\n"Quit it kid, you don't know anything 'till you've been in the shit." replied Ryu dryly.\n\nAka zips up his boilersuit and puts out his cigarette, before his hachimaki around his forehead. A sign of rebellion against the state establishment, bikers like Aka take signs of patriotism and own it for themselves.\n\n"Alright old man, so where am I takin' Midori tonight?"\n\n"Out to the ports, other side of Tokyo. If we get there by 2, why not ride around in Saitama for a bit?"\n\nAka, Ryu and three other bikers turn tail, rev their engines and ride off into the night. Several metres behind them, a seemingly unoccupied Toyota switches on its headlamps. Inside the car are two plainclothes officers, silently watching Aka and the bikers for a while now.

These comments follow the uncovering of a particularly brutal scene in which elderly veterans of the Great East Asia War had been murdered in the street.\n\nThe recent violence and historic tensions between settlers and natives of Outer Manchuria can find its origins in issues of social and economic disparity, but local governments insist that the disputes are the fault of simple miscommunication gone wrong.

 jap.132.d:0 "Manchuria had been a prized possession of Japan for many decades now. The vast tonnes of steel located in said Northeastern region of China had become the cornerstone stock for the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere. Iron would be mined from the earth in huge quantities and then brought to the cities in the south to be smelted and processed. From there, the steel would be shipped across the rest of the Sphere. Day after day, week after week, the demand for Manchurian steel never ceased. In fact, it only seemed to grow more insistent by the hour. Steel was a pillar upon which nearly every part of modern existence was built.\n\nWith Manchuria having no real competition in terms of steel production, it was vital to ensure that all was well with the economy there. Should it fall behind, then the precarious web of supply and demand could easily start to unravel. The local Manchurian government was required to make regular and particularly detailed reports into the financial situation of the steel industry.\n\nWhile the steel was still in Manchuria, it was kept closely guarded throughout its entire journey. It was not uncommon for the military to directly oversee the transportation of some shipments, even going as far as to station soldiers onboard along with the occasional navy warship. It became something of a common joke to claim that stealing state secrets was easier than running off with a single steel bar."

The state of Mancukuo had been under the management of its Prime Minister, Nobusuke Kish for some decades now. Through ruthless and deeply cold methods, he had turned the northern reaches of China into a giant industrial zone. Steel was the most prized resource. Its practicality and ubiquity made it desired by virtually everyone. Kishi had therefore made protecting this vital business a key goal. Although his style of governance had garnered him a reputation for cruelty, the results he produced were enough to stop the government in Tokyo from caring too much. Now, it was time to once again confirm his efforts in Manchukuo were paying off.\n\nFor a good while, the Manchurian economy had steadily chugged along, despite the situation outside of the major cities. Rural life continued in the same way as it had for a good deal of time, despite the induction of modern equipment on some of the larger farms. The Steel industry continued to perform well, although this was to be expected. Despite this, the slow pace of development had become an increasingly pressing issue for Tokyo. In recent years, they had increased their demands for further expansion and growth. Kishi, not one to back down, was fully prepared to ignore his supposed superior's request.\n\nYet he could also see the possible benefits of making certain minor adjustments to his own report. The benefits of making more inroads with political circles on the Home Islands was never to be overstated. It would also finally release Kishi from some of Prime Minister Ino's infeasible demands. With his choices in mind, Kishi set out to write the report."

For the past few years, the economy had remained mostly stable, which the state's Prime Minister, Nobosuke Kishi had largely been accredited for. Now that said first minister had completed the report, it was on its way to Tokyo. First to receive the documents was Prime Minister Ino, who would then pass it on to the Imperial Diet, as well as the Emperor if he so desired to read it. Having finally received the report, Ino began to read over the documents that were contained within the dossier. Written across three pages in Kishi's typically droll fashion, was an otherwise rather standard report. The agrarian sections of the economy were still the largest, although industrial sectors were slowly beginning to creep up to their size. Steel, the prized resources of Manchukuo continued to be mined in exorbitant quantities, just about enough to keep up with the demands of the Sphere.\n\nIno finished reading. The situation in Manchukuo was perfectly satisfactory and consistent with Kishi's previous efforts. The Prime Minister could not but feel somewhat disappointed though, regarding the consistency of small progress as a sign of incapability. He would have to mention it to Kishi next time they spoke."

The puppet State in Northern China had been governed by the notorious Nobosuke Kishi for some time. His tenure had seen some general improvements to the economy, of which he had taken the credit for. Kishi praised his brutal methods, which he considered the key to his success. Prime Minister Ino was in truth disinterested in the matter of who was responsible or how they had managed it. Only the contents of the report mattered to him. After receiving the report, which had been delivered to his residence directly from the airport, Ino began to read. Three documents were stored in the dossier that had arrived on Ino's desk, with the first paper entitled: The Economic Situation of the State of Manchukuo". Written in Kishi's surprisingly droll fashion, the three papers detailed remarkable and rapid growth in the Manchurian economy. The Steel industry, previously struggling to keep up with the demands, was now producing the necessary supply at a comfortable rate. The industrial sector was beginning to expand as well. It appeared that in a few years, it would overtake the agrarian sector, once Manchukuo's only source of revenue.

 jap.136.d:0 "China, with its large size and population made for the perfect place for industrial and agricultural development. Although already the second largest economy in the Sphere, China's true economic potential was as yet untapped. For this reason, much had been invested by both Japan itself and the local Chinese government to modernise the extensive areas of land available for use. It was a popular goal indeed, as most Japanese and Chinese politicians wished to see it completed as soon as possible.\n\nChina already provided the absolute majority of workers for the entire Sphere, providing Japan's power bloc with everything from weaponry to everyday electronics. These factories were owned by Japanese companies, using them to produce ubiquitous yet simple goods for maximum profit. The coastal cities had expanded greatly over the decades, but it was still the agrarian countryside that made up the largest part of the Chinese economy. Most of the Sphere's food supply came from China, with most of the inland country still being used for aiding this purpose. It was the manner in which farming had conducted that had changed somewhat, however.Where rural communities had once sustained their way of life through farming, corporations now controlled vast areas of land, using it to cultivate their produce on the widest possible scale. Entire villages could be employed by the same company, all working to produce the same foodstuff.\n\nLabor was kept cheap through the disposability of individual workers, who could be easily replaced by one of ten who were desperate for work. The ratio of the system meant that there was seemingly always room for expansion, always more opportunity to open more factories or to expand the farmlands. It was becoming increasingly common for most Sphere-based companies to centre their centres of production in China. Here, as the CEOs put it, they could operate freely and without the nuisance of regulation that they faced back home. Indeed, they made use of China's difficult position to the very fullest."

Although the coastal cities had come a long way from the war-torn remnants of the end of the Sino-Japanese war, most larger settlements were still in the same condition as they had been for much of the twentieth century. Agriculture was still the dominant part of the economy, thanks to the largely undeveloped parts of the countryside. Rural life had changed somewhat. A great number of farms had been consolidated into the holdings of a handful of companies. Other communities had survived mostly untouched, left to carry out their lives in near isolation, with only occasional contact from regional authorities to ensure that their presence was still felt. The progression of ending agrarian economic dominance was slow going. It would take many years until China could be considered a nation with a modern economy. Cities would require far more investment. The countryside needed it more so, in order to even make the land useful for the industrial sector. It was now time for the Chinese President to make his report on the state of the economy. An objective and transparent report was the obvious answer, although that carried the inevitable consequences of Japan's stern disapproval. Fear of disappointment aside, Tokyo was not the most astute of masters. They were unlikely to notice a few slight alterations to the report. Regardless, the President would need to make his decision without delay. "

China's vast area, population and resources made it a perfect location to build a massive industrial hub. This was the grand project that Ino, and his predecessors desired to see completed. The Prime Minister hoped that the economic report would remind the Chinese government how pressing this matter was. With the dossier now on his desk, Ino began to pour over its contents.\n\nThe Prime Minister had expected to see some progress towards industrial development, he had demanded it after all, but the report suggested that China was well on its way towards industrialisation. After many years of difficult progression, it seemed that China had just about entered a new phase of modernization. Although the industrial sector was beginning to grow larger, agriculture too had experienced a massive leap in output.

Despite this important purpose and its status as the second largest economy of the Sphere, it was industrial expansion that was now the focus of both Nanjing and Tokyo. Intentions aside, industrialization had been slow going. Ino, like his predecessors, had insisted that the Chinese government focus their efforts on this purpose. As the dossier was placed on his desk, the Prime Minister hoped that his demanding tone had finally paid off.\n\nIno's urgently rapid reading quickly made him realise that his methods were futile. As he had in previous years, he felt a mixture of anger and disappointment. China had failed him once again Industrialization was not in full swing, with some very unimpressive movement towards that goal. The agrarian sector of the economy had not changed radically either. The introduction of modern farming equipment and methods had done little to help ramp up production. Only some of the very largest farms had truly begun to modernise.

Although not quite the same size as its rival government to the west, Bose had attempted to make the most of his territory. Modernisation had always been a key goal of his and now the cities and farmlands of Free India exported much of their products and produce to the Co-Prosperity Sphere market.\n\nBengal in particular created many goods considered highly sought-after, most notably, the region's renowned textile work. Ever since the days of the Roman Empire, these fine works of handicraft had been sought after across the world. British rule in India had only increased the worldwide demand for Bengali textiles. Manufacturing increased to new heights, as new machinery was brought in to increase the amount of textiles produced.\n\nAlthough now independent from British rule, not much had changed in the way of demand for textiles. The exportation of these goods was now a way to sustain the economy of an independent, if somewhat inconsistently recognised nation. Their popularity in Japan and the wider Sphere, ensured that demand for Bengali textiles never seemed to drop. Yet the situation regarding the rest of the Sphere's economy troubled many. Despite the efforts of Subhas Chandra Bose to increase industrialisation, the overwhelming majority of land in Free India was still being used for agriculture. The crops that were produced were needed for feeding the population and could therefore not contribute much to the economy. It was for this reason that the textile industry was so fiercely protected.

As had been the case with every other time that this had been done, there were two paths ahead detailing how to handle the situation. Firstly there was the choice to simply report the situation as it truly was. Azad Hind, although rather developed despite its short existence, was not exactly a major financial center. Bose had attempted a number of economic plans over the decades, which seemed to only really produce mixed results. Much of the economy was still agrarian, with only some cities acting as significant industrial bases.\n\nOf course, this was all bad news that Tokyo did not perhaps not need to hear. The Free Indian government was well within its power to emburse certain parts of the report. Would it truly matter if certain numbers were increased and mentions of certain fields were replaced with references to new factories, if only to make the Japanese content? To Netaji Bose, it seemed that a small white lie might just provide his country with the time to make an earnest report for next year."

Eventually he returned bearing an envelope, much the same as all the other reports. Wasting no time, Ino used an ornate letter opener to extract the information sealed inside.Like each in the series of reports, the letter began with "Report on the economy of Free India". The Prime Minister scanned the documents, but quickly found that he had read enough to grasp the situation. Across three pages, the Free Indian Government had outlined their situation over the past year. Despite some difficulties, the economy was now doing particularly well, with no signs of declining in the near future. In fact, most graphs showed that more growth could be expected in virtually all major sectors. Agrarianism was beginning to come to an end, with signs of major industrialization in the coming years.\n\nTo Ino, this was a sign of triumph. Not only was a significant economy in the Sphere doing well for itself, but it had occurred under his leadership. Azad Hind may have done the heavy lifting, but it was due to the pressure of the Prime Minister that the successes had been seen in the first place. Or so Ino seemed to think that it had occurred that way."

Ino, sitting in his office, had just received a phone call verifying that the report had arrived at Tokyo airport just under an hour ago. Upon its arrival to his personal estate, Ino asked for the precious documents to be delivered to him immediately. Once the documents that the report consisted of had been brought to Ino's office, he wasted no time in reading them. "Report on the Economy of Free India", said the title page simply. Outlined over three pages of text, charts and graphs, was the stark truth of East India's economy.\n\nThe report did not outline a disastrous situation. The economy was in fact managing to stay afloat, but at a level far below the expectations of Japanese projections. It did not appear that the situation was too likely to shift radically in the coming years. Azad Hind would remain a mostly agrarian society for a good while yet. At the bottom of the last page was a small section, entitled "Plans for Stimulating Economic Growth". Yet by that point, Ino had stopped reading. Solutions to the problem that he had just been made aware of seemed rather useless at that moment. Up until that point, The Prime Minister had assumed that the situation in Azad Hind was entirely positive. Now it was clear that a significant member of the Sphere was financially lagging far behind what was expected. The copies of the report would soon begin to circulate in wider economic and political circles, which would only hasten its impact. Ino was left wondering if there was some way to put the spotlight on the transparency of the report, although that still led directly to the problems it presented."

He is establishing a new Oil company based around the Sakhalin fields, and he is wondering if Ino's government would be interested in subsidising this enterprise. The prospecting operation was successful and a large and profitable field was found. Sasakawa believes that expanding oil extraction in the area will be a good way to make the Sakhalin economy less dependent on agriculture and could potentially bring in a lot of educated workers. Long term it could even evolve Toyohara into an important center in the our Empire's far north.\n\nCertainly a good idea, Ino is however unsure if the best is to handle the request within the Kantei or give it to Kishi Nobosuke in Manchuria, he could possibly integrate it into the larger economic plans for the north."

His numerous enterprises and contributions to the war effort in past decades had ensured he would remain influential whether the government wished it or not. Now that he had discovered oil, ever precious and essential to the function of the Sphere, Sasakawa had the full attention of the Kantei.\n\nSubsiding his oilfields would be no cheap matter, as was the case with anything involving oil extraction. There were risks to consider as well. Caution suggested that only a small sum should be given to Sasakawa, lest his venture fail spectacularly. Yet other voices suggested that Sasakawa's business in Sakhalin was more than sound enough to deserve a generous investment. The rewards would surely be great if all went as well as Sasakawa was describing it to be. Having heard both sides being put forward, Prime Minister Ino would now have the final say."

Besides, the businessman had never actually stated exactly how much in yen he was hoping to receive in subsidies. To finish off the matter, the Prime Minister would write a letter informing Sasakawa of the government's contribution to his endeavours in Sakhalin. With that done, Ino thought little more of the matter, believing it to be successfully completed.\n\n"Prime Minister, Ryoichi Sasakawa is on line one. He says he wishes to discuss your terms of payment. He seemed rather displeased, if that says anything." With a nod, Ino dismissed his aide and picked up the receiver. "Prime Minister, I apologise for calling you at this hour, but I am afraid that there appears to be some sort of spelling error in the document you sent me. The one that details the funds. Ino, having checked the documents himself, replied that there could not have been any sort of fault. "Really? I must say that the section detailing the total subsidies seems to be missing at least one or two zeroes. Such a small amount would otherwise be a poor joke!\n\nRealising that he was dealing with more than a technical error, Ino requested to phone Sasakawa back in five minutes.

Sasakawa's lawyers proved that he could not have possibly been responsible for the letter. The handwriting was completely off, and it could not be linked to anyone close to Sasakawa either. No fingerprints either." Ino was left feeling both relieved that Sasakawa hadn't attempted to kill and disappointed that his only feasible suspect for the letter's author had just been ruled out. Just as he was about to put the matter out of his mind, the phone rang once more. "Prime Minister, I believe we've spoken over the phone." It was Ryoichi Sasakawa, sounding particularly pleased with himself. "I understand your response to this letter you received, it's only reasonable to want safety. However, next time something like this occurs, I would recommend you have the letter checked properly, to avoid any difficulties that could arise. Godday!""

 jap.150.d:0 "With government subsidies secured, construction on Sasakawa's Sakhalin oil wells soon began.Great heaps of steel and iron were brought up from the Home Islands to the remote and cold north. Once the foundations were laid, workers too made the journey northward, drawn by the promises of good wages and of modern housing that would await them once they returned from Sakhalin. Among the shores of Karafuto, a well was established, breaking up the steep landscape with a stark, industrial machine that produced its black out over the sky. But to those who stood to make a profit, the changes to the land- and seascape did not matter. The oil soon flowed, and Sasakawa looked to make a sizable profit on his latest venture.Prime Minister Ino was pleased too. Some had doubted his commitment to Sasakawa's oil project. Now he had proof he needed, that his government's money had been well spent. Oil was always precious and Ino could claim that he had an eye for finding reliable sources of it. The geologists who had actually found the source needed not to be mentioned, not even by their own employer."
 jap.150.a:0 "Money well spent, in Ino's eyes at least."

 jap.151.t:0 "More Money for Sasakawa"
 jap.151.d:0 "Having successfully constructed and operated one oil well in Karafuto, the question of whether or not Sasakawa should receive further funding. The well had been a success, extracting a profitable tonnage of oil month with no shortage in site for a long while. The idea of a second, or even third well seemed like the best way to move forward with the operation. After all, if one well was producing at an exceptional rate, surely two more would only pay for themselves?.\n\nSasakawa could obviously afford to cover the costs of construction and employing more workers. Regardless of if he actually asked for it or not, the businessman would still be asking for more subsidisation. Once again, Prime Minister Ino would make the decision as to how much Sasakawa would be receiving. A great deal of money had already been invested in the oil wells. Caution spoke of providing a reduced sum, enough to provide Sasakawa with some "motivation". Yet with all the success that the business has seen so far, other voices suggested that even more money should be poured into the oil wells, to truly access the full potential of Karafuto's oil reserves. Eventually Ino decided to invest:"

The construction did not go quite as well as planned this time. The foundations, thought to be firmly secured to the ground, gave way. The structure buckled under its own weight and tilted into the water before finally coming to a rest, lopsided and halfway in the icy water. Fortunately, this seemingly considerable setback, could be resolved with the use of the additional funds from the government. All would soon be restored to working order, apart from that which came at the loss of human life. Once the iron frame was properly attached and secured, the mechanisms could finally be welded into their proper places. After about a month of delays, the oil rig was finally finished, joining its twin in their much valued purpose. The icy waters of Karafuto seemed to grow darker, as production ramped up. At the same time, the increase in oil production lifted the spirits of Sasakawa and Prime Minister Hiroya Ino. Despite the setbacks, the additional funding had allowed for another rig to be built. Even more oil would now be available for the government to utilise. Karafuto did eventually benefit from the oil wells. The money from new industry helped to modernise both the once entirely agricultural economy and the settlements of Karafuto as well. Toyohara developed into a proper town, with a matching port. Immigration rose significantly, as the oil attracted those who sought to find even more of the precious resource. While the oil fields grew and tarnished the landscape somewhat, the people of Karafuto prefecture took solace in the precious comforts it had brought them."

 jap.153.t:0 "The Budget Didn't Last"
 jap.153.d:0 "From the very beginning, construction of the second oil well met great difficulty. The ground upon which the foundations were to be placed, was found to be greatly unsteady. Without extensive work to properly strengthen the ground, no well could be built without risking a collapse. Yet such work was far beyond what the budget could allow for. Upon hearing news of the severe delay, Sasakawa quickly turned towards a source of new funds, one that he hoped would do well not to disappoint him.\n\n"Prime Minister, I have some bad news. However, I believe we can work forward if you agree to my solution." Ino, suspicious that Sasakawa's plan might involve more subsidies, asked him to carry on with his explanation. "In order to safely extract the oil, further work must be done to secure the foundations. I suggest you provide me with more funds, in order to get the operation back on track. After all, this is oil you need."\n\nIno, feeling confident, refused the offer. He instead suggested that Sasakawa cough up the necessary funds using his own money. "Prime Minister, we both know that would be most unwise. I can abandon this second well, without a second thought. But if I do that, how will it reflect upon the government that funded me? Do you really want to appear to have such a bad eye for investment? Ino was left without time to answer the question. "Now, I understand you will need time to consider this. I won't take a moment more of your time. The phone line went quiet and the Prime Minister was left to write up the required funds. This was much to his displeasure."

 jap.154.t:0 "Ino's Corruption Scandal"
 jap.154.d:0 "Sasakawa eventually got his money. Construction on the second oil well soon resumed and all seemed to be going as planned once more. That was until Sasakawa's rather casual mention of the additional funding he had received during a number of conferences and business lunches. Word of the transaction slowly trickled its way out of corporate sectors and into political ones. Unfortunately for the Prime Minister, it was his political rivals who heard the news first. Even with the full context of providing subsidies for a major company, Ino's proceeding financial investments could easily be misconstrued as acts of corruption.\n\nThe Prime Minister, already surrounded by rumours of economic misdeeds, was an easy target for a fresh accusation of corruption. For a few days, it was all the Diet could bring themselves to speak of. Unlike many of the other times that the issue of Inos extensive corruption had been raised, the very real evidence of Sasakawa's proclamation made the matter far more intense. Despite being a sitting member of the Diet himself, Sasakawa was noticeably absent. Although he had been just as involved as the Prime Minister, he may as well have stood in the centre of the house of representatives, for lack of notice he received. Ino was left to bear the brunt of the political backlash from his less than secure investments."
 jap.154.a:0 "Not even a hint of discretion!"

 jap.155.t:0 "The Well is Finished"
 jap.155.d:0 "By the time the scandal of Ino's investments had blown over for the most part, the second oil well had almost been completed. The last few safety checks were finished, which found the ground to finally be safe for proper construction. Compared to the seemingly gargantuan task of ensuring stability, the actual putting together of the well went swimmingly. Finally, operations at the second well could begin, with only a small shadow of economic abuse swirling over it. Karafuto, once a quiet place, grewer louder with the sounds of industry and of toil. Now with two machines pumping oil up from the earth, Sasakawa's latest business was starting to become even more productive and profitable. For him, the second well was exactly what he had needed it to be.\n\nFor Ino, the entire process of getting to the oil he had subsidised had been arduous and not without harm to his personal image. Still, oil was ever valuable and it would eventually drown out some of the criticism of the Prime Minister in its useful purpose. As time went on, the oil well began to produce other positive results. The local economy started to diversify slightly and the necessity of transporting vast quantities of oil brought about the modernisation of the Toyohara port. It all occurred a little too late to mitigate people's opinions of the Prime Minister."
 jap.155.a:0 "I'm sure the military will make use of the oil at least."

 jap.156.t:0 "Kishi's Busy"
 jap.156.d:0 ""Sasakawa presents an interesting proposition. However, I think it best that someone with more expertise in local matters handles his request for subsidies. Get me Kishi on the phone." Nobsuke Kishi,Prime Minister of Manchukuo, was the obvious man to turn to, if the Kantei was not to handle the oil venture. Kishi had spent much of his time in his domain developing it with brutal efficiency and brutal methods. Ino was sure that the possibility of Kishi being granted new oil wells for his northern fiefdom would be more than enough to convince him that Sasakawa's offer was worth it.\n\n"Kishi, I have a proposal from Ryoichi Sasakawa to present to you." Kishi's reply was simply, a mere "Go on". "He wishes for aid in funding his efforts in extracting oil in Karafuto prefecture. He claims it could seriously benefit the local economy and eventually provide us with a proper port to the far north." Ino could only hear the crackling static on the other end of the line, as Kishi seemed to consider the proposal in silence. "Well I am afraid to say Prime Minister, that particular matters here in Manchukuo are far more pressing. It would be most unwise of me to turn my attention away at this time." Although disappointed, Ino could do nothing more than to accept the answer he had been given. De Jure authority aside, Nobosuke Kishi was not a man to force an issue with.\n\nWith the First Minister of Manchukuo too busy, Ino would have to handle the matter himself. While having more control over the oil wells was certainly beneficial, the prospect of negotiating funding with Sasakawa was the furthest thing from an enjoyable experience."

Taken aback by the failures, scientists observing from a distance threw their clipboards by their sides as they shot down their arms in frustration. Malfunction, they concluded, as reports that followed cited a defect in the adaptation of the Type 120 ignition system; a result of the cold weather's effects on the heated electrical wire within the weapon.\n\nDisappointed, the soldier disengaged his equipment and removed the tanker from his back. He dragged his feet towards his squad members, and they welcomed him with a nodding acceptance. Perhaps more disheartened, the scientific examiners leaned over the observing railings that peers over the testing fields at a loss for words. It was experience, they thought, coping with the dread of reporting a systems failure back to the officers."

The local doctor had arrived too late, and the boy died of blood loss before anything could be done. The parents were not unlike the boy; shocked, confused, and scared. However, they could scream. Their cries were heard all night, for their boy, mourning that could be understood by anybody a world over.\n\nThe next day, they found a new determination, to find out what had happened to their son. It had not happened at the nearby factory. Nothing in that hell could cut off a hand. The father overheard the boy's friends talking amongst themselves. They said that in the forest south of the village there was a great machine. That was where his son had gone. He shook as he pushed his way through the forest. Was that blood on the ground? A finger shrouded in dirt, or just his mind? Finally, he came across trees, cut for what must have been a quarter of a kilometre, though not by human hands. The cuts were rough and jagged, terribly irregular. At the end of this strange valley was a hulking plane, rusting. The wreck was beautiful, even as it fell apart. This was the place where his son had met death.\n\nA flag of stars and stripes adorned the side, bringing back memories of a war of starvation and desperation. Even in a plane like this, there was likely bombs that had gone unexploded. He attempted to squeeze in through a puncture on the plane's side, but he emerged with a deep gash from a sharp piece of metal. Circling the plane, he took a wrong step.\n\nA brief, fleeting moment of comprehension dawned on the father's face."

He and his two comrades had been raiding villages and police outposts in the mountains of Eastern Shandong for decades, somehow evading capture even as a manhunt for years into the mountains gained the public's interest.\n\nNow, one were firmly in the hands of the police. The rest were dead. An entire Kempeitai unit, replete with helicopters, machine guns, and night vision goggles had been in close pursuit for the better part of the night. Each man was gunned down, and yet Huang Kecheng had survived. Under no small amount of duress, he admitted to reason and the murder of villagers. An interrogation quickly began, in full force. The man, revealed to be a member of the old Communist Party, was disheveled and confused. He refused to believe the war was over and screamed when he heard that Chongqing had been destroyed. Even after agents displayed a photo of Mao Zedong's corpse, splayed across the ground of Chongqing, he continued denying.

Formerly a backwater in the one of the most far-flung regions of the Japanese Empire, the Aleutian Islands had become a sort of a mini business haven for those who couldn't make it in Tokyo. Prior to the establishment of the Sakura Resort, the Aleutian Islands was a seedy underbelly - ironic given its sparsity and distance from Japan. American and Canadian contraband goods flow through the tiny ports of Attu and Kiska - from Lucky Strikes to Playboy magazines.\n\nOf course, that was until the IJN area commander was replaced after crossing some higher-up. Since then, the crime-infested underbelly turned into a haven for Japan's thrill-seekers under one of Sasakawa's many affiliates - from extreme hiking, to snowboarding and winter fishing in the frigid north. Of note, many of the former criminals and contraband smugglers still eke out their livings there, just under a new, shiny uniform and the veneer of an actual company.\n\nSasakawa himself has managed to distance himself sufficiently from this project - though anybody who's anybody in Japan knows that there is more to the resort's profit than salmon hunting and tabloid-friendly adrenaline rush adventures. In spite of it all, Sasakawa has stayed clean - no traces of the resort's profit is tangibly 'dirty money'.\n\nThough, one just has to ask for the 'Special Menu' at the Izakaya between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. every Wednesday, and one would discover that not much has changed since."

He let the needle go, as the upbeat flutes and faint backing vocals gave way to the Queen of Trot herself. For someone who had lived her entire life under Japanese rule, her Korean was nearly free of Japanese.\n\nThough he shouldn't really be complaining - he was born in America, after all. A knock on the door startled Seungu; his legs kicked the desk, shaking the equipment.\n\n"Sorry about that, Seungu-ssi. Someone from the government came earlier and gave this to me." Sooyoung held up a manila folder, stuffed with papers, continuing. "I read everything. You'll want this." She dropped it on Seungu's lap, as he played the next song. Skimming over its contents, he smirked. This was something he could do.\n\nA week later, the PA systems of the Japanese legations came to life: the songs of Toyota Nadeshiko and Mitsugi Nori played. Confusion, then amusement turned to terror as all military frequencies were flooded with music. Nothing could come in from the legations, and nothing could come out. For Tokyo, this was a disaster. For Washington, Seungu, and Radio Soul, the operation could not have been more of a success."

A growing pile of poems, of the best prose she could muster stood tall on her desk, ready to collapse if the smallest breath touched it.\n\nZiqi was hunched over her desk, calculating how many sales she would have to make to cover rent. Deep in thought, her train of thought was broken by the ringing of the chimes, and the paper tower collapsed. Too slow to react, Ziqi watched as the customer tried to save her stack of papers, only for it to fall over the floor. Looking up, she realized that a Japanese officer had just walked into her store. Face pale, she shot up.\n\n"Do you need any help, sir?" She cringed at her Japanese.\n\n"I'm so sorry for causing that mess, do you need any help?" The officer seemed genuinely apologetic and embarrassed - Ziqi nodded. In a few seconds, the stack had been reassembled, then divided into chunks to avoid an incident.\n\n"Do you happen to sell trot?"

"There's Kim Hye-ja and Choi Sook-ja." The officer nodded, searching through the mass of covers.

For Captain Hata and his humble crew of ten, the day had provided good fortune. They were somewhere off the coast of Manchukuo, out of the way of the crowded seas, from the competition. Here, the water was clear of others, and the Hiraumi was free to fish wherever they pleased. The tuna and bonito kept coming, and all knew that they would dine well.\n\nSunset arrived, and the crates were packed with ice and fish. Making preparations to sail back home, Captain Hata saw a shadow of a boat in the distance, with what looked like a man holding a net. Holding binoculars to his eyes, he could easily see it - it was another fisherman, probably a Russian. His eyes slightly hurt - he was looking directly into the setting sun, after all.\n\nCompared to the relatively clean appearance of the fisherman, as well as the good shape the Hiraumi was in, the Russian was... poor. His ship was clearly falling apart, in spite of his best efforts. His facial expression was grim, as he pulled out his net from the ocean. Fortune was clearly not on his side; no shine of fish scales could be seen. And the fisherman himself was not in the best condition.

For such cheap tea, it was rather strong, and warmed their souls as the weather stole heat.\n\nA loud knock on the door turned their attention away from the conversation. The leader, Hayato, stood up and opened the door. Standing on the porch, clutching a parasol and attempting to carry what seemed to be a heavy tray covered in cloth, was a shivering girl. Couldn't have been more than 10, he surmised. Hayato raised his eyebrows, letting the girl in. She was emotionless, any sympathy not revealing itself. Hayato took the tray from her; she was struggling to carry it and the girl sighed in relief. He lifted the cloth, checking to make sure it was not explosives.\n\nOn the tray was an assortment of wheel-shaped pastries. They reminded Hayato of Chinese mooncakes, albeit without the elaborate designs stamped on time. He brought it over to the men, who were delighted to have some snacks.

If that was the case, surely it would not be so terrifying.\n\nBut with all things, their leave was ephemeral.

The "Space Defender Zaku" project, referred to as "Zaku" colloquially, is the animated brainchild of director Yoshiyuki Tomino. "Zaku" depicts ace pilot Char Aznable as he pilots his titular red fighting robot, the Zaku, in space combat against the Earth Federation Space Forces. The Principality of Zeon's mass production of the Zaku gave the nation the technological edge against the underprepared Federation Forces leading to many decisive victories early in the conflict. It is only when the Federation unveils the Gundam, a high performance mobile suit, that the tide begins to turn. The series takes Lt. Cmdr. Aznable on many adventures in the pursuit of destroying the Gundam, demonstrating Aznable's incredible skill with piloting the Zaku against superior Federation opponents.\n\nAlready "Zaku" has received rave reviews and rumors are circulating that the series's 52 episode season is being extended towards 60 episodes. Zeon's portrayal as a highly disciplined and devoted fighting force in a noble war of liberation against the corrupt "democratic" Earth Federation bears notable parallels with real-world politics causing some fans to ponder Tomino's motivation with his depictions in the show. "Polity Against Zaku", a group opposed to the airing of "Zaku", decries the show's depiction of Zeon despot Degwin's inability to control his military as "ignorant revisionist commentary" and already have sent petitions to the office of producer Sunrise Entertainment.

It is believed that the Zaku's rugged, utilitarian design mixed with Lt. Cmdr. Char's charismatic red paint scheme have instilled the Zaku as signature of "cool" with the modern youth. The Gundam's red, blue, and white aesthetic is seen as unappealing with its bright, toy-like colors being seen as "immature" and "too western" by viewers.

It is our good-faith desire to assist Japan by taking over the administrations of Xikang and Yunnan.

While most of China's coastal regions were under rule from Nanjing, some smaller warlords to the southwest had remained de-facto independent. These army generals had gained their status through the Japanese policy of limiting Nanjing's direct authority in the region. The generals were free to do as they pleased within their remote fiefdoms, without as much as needing to inform the central government of their actions. While this had served to satisfy Tokyo's fears of severe insubordination and pleased some , the Republic of China felt increasingly spited by this state of affairs. It became increasingly common for the Chinese government to state their wishes to integrate the southwestern provinces.\n\nThe fear of increasing centralisation in China was certainly enough to cause significant alarm in Tokyo.

The Prime Minister had nothing to offer him but silence.\n\nThe fall of Nanjing signalled the now inevitable fall of China. Neither Japan, or the National Government could have foreseen such a disaster. Some even wondered if Long Yun, seemingly driven only by his mad vengefulness, had truly believed it possible that he would enter Nanjing. Even Long Yun's return to Yunnan had been shocking enough, as Japan and China both believed him long dead after years of torture and imprisonment. Now, China's shattered order formed a perfect picture of the breakdown of society. What remained of National Government forces were hurtling towards the Manchurian border in hope of eventually rallying there. Long Yun and his allies, now legtimised as a threat by their "impossible victory," found little in the way of actual resistance. That which they could find was met with nothing but brutality, the worst of which befell the leaders. Yun's control over China was still shaky and inconsistent, but the sheer shock of his uprising had provided him with dangerous momentum.\n\nSaid shock was now being felt in Japan too. Bickering had erupted in the Imperial Diet over just who was responsible for the catastrophe. The Prime Minister had disappeared, supposedly locked in conversation with the military and a number of his closest advisors. Hindsight had ruined any chance of meaningful talks, and little more than an order to prepare forces to make for the Manchurian border with former National government China. Even with the combined forces of the Chinese remnants, Manchurian armies and reinforcements from the Home Islands, morale was poor. Were they truly fighting against the armies of a living man?

Very few of his other forces had chosen to accept a siege, let alone surrender. There was little left of the army Long Yun had built, neither here, nor in any part of China that he had conquered in only a few months. The Warlord had been pushed back all the way from the Manchurian border, growing only more deranged and violent as his once victorious armies were forced back into Yunnan. Once there, they had made their last stand. Only those that the IJA had managed to capture survived, and once they had been questioned, execution was to be their only fate. A few trials were scheduled for the remnants of Yun's officer corp, which Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] hoped would serve as a fitting end to their brief rule of China. In truth, most felt that the entire matter should be wrapped up with as much haste as they could afford.\n\nChina, for the second time in 20 years, had experienced a full scale war. City and countryside alike had been ravaged by the conflict, particularly as Yun had dug in to hold ground. The Japanese, as well as the remnants of the ROC armies had also experienced heavy casualties. No more was this the case as when the fighting to regain China had become increasingly vicious. The crusade had ended successfully, but even so, it was wrapped in a mantle of past failures.

This has been a divisive argument, as is expected of the fate of hundreds of millions of people. Certain positions have taken hold regarding the shape of a new China, or if there will be a new China at all. The administration is hesitant towards all options, and wishes to inspect their consequences thoroughly. That said, a decision must be made, for the rebuilding of China must begin as soon as possible if we are to regain our losses.\n\n The first choice is, of course, a return to the status quo, before all of this chaos enraptured our continent. This is a popular option, as the status quo was popular with Japanese businessmen and industrial magnates. Chinese industry is united, and made easier for exploitation. There is a singular China for us and the world to deal with, as well as independently-minded governors on the border territories who can serve as our knife in China's back. That said, as can be seen from this international tragedy, the status quo was not stable. The people of China would be very resentful if, after all this violence and war, nothing changes, and nothing is reformed. It is difficult to disagree.\n\n For those paranoid towards the idea of China ever again rising to challenge Japan as it has now (and there are many, many of those paranoid at such a thing), an extreme idea, previously only held by a fringe of politicans, has taken hold. The end of China as a nation. If not the eternal elimination of China, then the total decentralization of China until command of the nation is split between several separate administrations. The industrial sector will despise the arbitrary splitting of China into cut-up economic zones, but they would despise it even more if all of our Chinese industrial investments were lost to another rebellion.\n\n Yet, not everything remains so bleak. Others have seen the death of the Western Insurrection as our opportunity to birth anew a greater, larger economic giant than the China of old. What was this all for if not seeing our mistakes in collaboration and administration? They wish to see China centralized, the doing-away of near-independent local governors and the corrupt, nepotistic warlordism of the past. A clean spick and span China shall arise for us, so they say.\n\n Whichever way our administration drifts, we must stay firm and consistent in our vision, lest we fall prey to the mistakes we made in the recreation of China the last time.

"Chinese matters need to stay in Chinese hands."\n\nWith the Japanese diplomatic efforts rebuffed, the government cannot pursue the course of intervention for now. The Imperial Japanese Army, with its assortment of hot-headed generals and officers, are the loudest voices in favor. The Navy quietly nods its assent. However, the Prime Minister pretends not to hear these complaints. The Chinese are doing the same thing, after all.\n\nIf the opportunity presents it, however, the Chinese government may be persuaded to part with its sovereignty in return for its survival. Until then, the government shall undertake to silence the dissent within its ranks. If China needs help later, it must pay."

 jap_interregnum.2.d:0 "Emergency meetings have already begun in the House of Peers and in the House of Representatives to find a replacement for Ino. While Japanese politics are dominated by the Taisei Yokusankai, the party itself is bitterly split among numerous rival cliques, each representing different interest groups with different visions for the future of the Empire and the Sphere. While the Emperor nominates the Prime Minister, the Diet has a massive influence over His Majesty's decision, as the Diet can always vote a candidate they don't like out of office. However, most commentators both foreign and domestic agree that a new PM will be chosen soon, as had occured when Tojo and Kido were forced to resign in the past.\n\nTwo major candidates have sprung forth from the ranks of the Taisei Yokusankai - Kaya Okinori and Ikeda Masanosuke. Kaya, formerly a minister of finance, belongs to the faction of the Yokusankai termed 'reform bureaucrats', advocating for further centralization and state intervention in Japanese economy, while at the same time removing the last remnants of military influence from the government of Japan. The other candidate, Ikeda, comes from the conservative wing of the Yokusankai, the one to which former Prime Minister Ino also belonged - a section of the party closer to the army and much less prone to reform.

 jap_interregnum.3.d:0 "In the somewhat confused situation after the fall of Ino, the reform bureaucrat faction has been trying to bolster their ranks and wrestle control of the Yokusankai. Rallying around Kaya Okinori, their candidate for PM, their voices are becoming louder and louder in the party, to the point where some speculate that their ultimate victory is close at hand.\n\nKaya himself has been releasing more and more bold statements in interview, with some commenting that he speaks as if he were Prime Minister already. Some murmuring is rising from representatives of the conservative wing of the Yokusankai, and there is fears that the reform bureaucrats are attempting a takeover of the party. However, it seems like Kaya's bid for the position has never been stronger."
 jap_interregnum.3.a:0 "Could reform be the way to go?"
 jap_interregnum.4.t:0 "Kaya's not very well liked, turns out"
 jap_interregnum.4.d:0 "In recent days, Kaya's attempts to cement his position as candidate for Prime Minister have been frustrated by constant and fierce resistance from the other wings of the Yokusankai. It seems that the politically aggressive stance of the reform bureaucrats has obtained the opposite effect of their goal, as it alienated the rest of the party and provoked backlash from the conservatives, now rallying more and more around Ikeda.\n\nSlammed by pro-conservative newspapers, Kaya has been forced to moderate his stance and go back on some of his earlier stances, and it seems like the offensive of the reform bureaucrats has already been exhausted. With Kaya's bid for the position weaker by the day, it appears likely that the new Prime Minister won't be a reform bureaucrat."

 jap_interregnum.5.t:0 "Ikeda Tries His Hand"
 jap_interregnum.5.d:0 "Among the conservatives of the Taisei Yokusankai, Ikeda Masanosuke has always been a prominent figure, so his bid for Prime Minister was a natural development after the fall of the previous government. Ikeda has been playing his cards more and more openly, appearing in interview on television and newspapers more and more frequently. Ikeda appeals to conservatives especially for his commitment to stability and preservation of policies that were successful during Ino's time, with slow reforms and a continued working relationship with the Imperial Armed Forces and maintaining a strong hold over the nations of the Sphere.\n\nA smaller base of support for Ikeda is found among the more liberal members of the Yokusankai, especially as Ikeda seems to be the only man capable of containing the ambitious and centralizing projects of the reform bureaucrats. However, Ikeda has been trying to find some mediation and compromise with Kaya's faction, and a successful compromise, no matter how weak, would be a major victory for him and the conservatives. With his position in the Yokusankai becoming stronger and stronger, it seems inevitable that he will be the next man to be chosen as Prime Minister."

 jap_interregnum.6.d:0 "An open letter published by the popular newspaper Asahi Shimbun is causing yet another shift in Japanese politics, largely because of the man signing it - Kishi Nobosuke. The former Japanese administrator in Manchuria, Kishi has maintained a strong influence in Japanese politics, as one of the leading representatives of the reform bureaucrat faction - however, the high esteem he enjoys among the general public and especially among Japan's political class have allowed him to seriously set back Ikeda's effort to gain the position of Prime Minister.\n\nIn his piece, Kishi harshly criticized Ikeda and the conservatives supporting it, painting him as a weak willed political lame duck that will bring only further stagnation, denying Japan the reform it needs - while at the same time drawing a direct line from the corruption and ineffectiveness of Ino's government to Ikeda, himself often viewed as the protégé of Ino. Such a strong attack has weakened Ikeda's position in the Yokusankai, and his attempts to find some mediation with other factions are now destined to remain a failure."

Political infighting in the Taisei Yokusankai have prevented the two major candidates, Kaya and Ikeda, from gaining a strong enough base of support, and Kido's attempt to nominate the Prime Minister by going directly through the Emperor has been slammed by the Diet. A dreaded word is being repeated more and more often by newspapers and television, in its numerous variants, all with the same meaning - political gridlock, impasse, stalemate, deadlock.\n\nThese new developments have been accompanied by an aura of pessimism spreading across Japan's government, and the country watches in fear as the unclear political direction might have ill effects on the economy as well. A solution must be found, and in times like these, the only solution can be compromise of a particular type - the one that leaves all parties unsatisfied."

 jap_interregnum.8.t:0 "Kido Suggests Kogure Budayuu"
 jap_interregnum.8.d:0 "To resolve the political snag that the Japanese government has found itself into, a old acquaintance of Japanese politics has stepped into the limelight - former Prime Minister and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Marquis Kōichi Kido. A staunch reform bureaucrat and Ino's predecessor, Kido has largely remained in the shadows of Japanese politics during recent years, after being ousted following his aggressive attempts to eliminate IJA influence in the civilian government.\n\nKido has stepped forth to the Emperor, proposing the name of Kogure Budayuu as a possible replacement for Ino. A relatively uninfluential member of the Yokusankai, Budayuu has served as a minister in Kido's cabinet. While Kido's strong influence in the Privy Council might mean that Budayuu could get nominated as Prime Minister by the Emperor himself, bypassing the Diet, this has already sparked a strong reaction from the sections of the Yokusankai that are more hostile to Kido."

 jap_interregnum.9.t:0 "The Diet Threatens No Confidence In Kogure"
 jap_interregnum.9.d:0 "A unified statement has been released by members of the Diet of the Taisei Yokusankai, stating that the party will not support the nomination of Budayuu as Prime Minister, instead immediately passing a vote of no confidence - signifying the end of Budayuu's tenure before it even begins. Such a bold statement is especially surprising, considering that it might mean defying the will of the Privy Council, and by extension, the Emperor himself.\n\nSome members of the Privy Council are already calling this a bluff - the Yokusankai wants to be left free to play its petty political games, but there's no way they would dare openly attacking the Privy Council in such an outrageous way. However, some are advising caution - if the Imperial Diet is serious, then a vote of no confidence would be a devastating blow the the Privy Council's political authority, potentially discrediting Kido and risking his position as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. This puts Kido in front of a quite difficult choice - should he back down, or call the Diet's bluff?"

 jap_interregnum.10.d:0 "The recent snag in which the Japanese government has found itself is a source of embarrassment for the whole nation, in the eyes of Asia and of the world. Heated negotiations between the Diet and the Privy Council, as well as within the Yokusankai itself, have so far gone nowhere. However, another group of politicians have weaseled into the negotiations - the clique of Yokusankai closer to former Prime Minister Ino Hiroya.\n\nWhile Ino himself was a national conservative, much like his protégé Ikeda, he was able to create a stable political equilibrium by compromising with the opposing factions of the Yokusankai, especially the reform bureaucrats now rallying around Kaya. Ino's involvement in the talks has been kept largely on the quiet side, but it might be the key to solving this mess."
 jap_interregnum.10.a:0 "A bit ironic."
 jap_interregnum.11.t:0 "A Suggestion"
 jap_interregnum.11.d:0 "Newspapers report that a new option is on the table, likely proposed by Ino Hiroya himself. Kiichi Aichi, a former minister of Ino's cabinet, is well known for his completely equal distance from all the major factions and cliques of the Yokusankai - his lack of charisma and commitment to a faction preventing him from initially being considered as a candidate to replace Ino. However, in this peculiar situation, Aichi might be the perfect person to fill the political rift that is dividing the Yokusankai.\n\nThe reactions from Kaya's and Ikeda's clique has been lukewarm, but it appears that there might be really no other option to get out of this mire. Kido Kōichi and the Privy Council have also expressed tentative agreement with Aichi's nomination. While nobody is truly satisfied or happy, with every passing day it seems more and more likely that Aichi will become the new Prime Minister."

 jap_interregnum.12.t:0 "The Emperor Refuses Kido!"
 jap_interregnum.12.d:0 "Kido's attempt to install Budayuu as Prime Minister has ended in failure as the Emperor has refused to nominate him. Newspapers are praising the Emperor's decision, as it seems like His Imperial Majesty was unwilling to go through with a nomination from above, which would contradict Japan's democratic institutions. In reality, it appears clear that the Emperor simply wished to avoid a worsening of the political crisis, as the Diet had promised a vote of no confidence - and there was no way to tell if it was a bluff or not.\n\nWhile predictable, this development is somewhat embarrassing to Kido and the Privy Council - however, many feel like Kido's plan failing to start protected the Lord Keeper's political standing from a far more devastating blow coming from the Imperial Diet."
 jap_interregnum.12.a:0 "Well, this went nowhere."
 jap_interregnum.13.t:0 "A Counterproposal"
 jap_interregnum.13.d:0 "In a last ditch attempt to retake control of the situation, Kido has set forth before the Emperor a second candidate for the position of Prime Minister - Kiichi Aichi. A long time minister of Ino's cabinet, Aichi's name has been proposed during backroom talks between the Privy Council and the Imperial Diet, and is much more likely to be approved by the Yokusankai and the Diet.\n\nQuite interestingly, Aichi's biggest advantage is his failure to commit to any faction of the Taisei Yokusankai. Equally distant from every major faction of the party, Aiichi served his tenures silently and without much ado - and would be thus the perfect solution to drag Japanese politics out of this rising dumpster fire. Faced with the necessity to act to resolve the crisis quickly, the Emperor has agreed to nominate Aiichi as Prime Minister, and it seems like the majority of the Taisei Yokusankai isn't willing to put forth a vote of no confidence."

 jap_interregnum.14.t:0 "Kiichi Aichi Appointed Prime Minister"
 jap_interregnum.14.d:0 "After one last round of meetings and negotiations, it seems like the Imperial Diet has finally found a way out of the political dead end. Kiichi Aichi has been chosen by the Emperor to fill the position of Prime Minister with near unanimous support from the Taisei Yokusankai - with the various wings of the party that had bitterly fought until recently now united at last.\n\nNewspapers across Japan and the Sphere celebrate this development, as a testament to Yokusankai, representing the will of the nation, overcoming petty factionalism and political infighting. A cautious, tentative optimism is spreading across Japan - but for those in the upper echelons of the Yokusankai, this is no time for celebration, let alone for relaxing."

 jap_interregnum.15.t:0 "The Interregnum"
 jap_interregnum.15.d:0 "Just few days into Aichi's tenure as Prime Minister, the vague air of optimism that had spread in Japan has dissolved in the wind. The process of forming a cabinet caused endless bickering in the Taisei Yokusankai, ending up with a patchwork cabinet made up of ministers from several different cliques that barely wish to speak to each other - what's worse, it seems that murmurs have risen from multiple factions of the party, plots to overthrow Aichi's government.\n\nThe Imperial Diet, the Privy Council, the Taisei Yokusankai - all are a pack of wolves, turning on each other after being left without a leader. While a facade of unity and optimism is paraded on newspapers and public appearances, and while ostensibly the party stands united behind Aichi, the truth is far different. The real struggle for power in the Japanese government is only starting, and no one knows how it will end."
 jap_interregnum.15.a:0 "The Interregnum has begun."
 jap_interregnum.16.t:0 "The National Polity"
 jap_interregnum.16.d:0 "It can be difficult to distinguish between truth and rumors in the whispers echoing through the Diet. But many deputies do have a knack for telling when conflict is brewing behind the scene. As the lame duck prime minister watches impotently, the Yokusankai's main factions sharpen knives and try to figure out the best angle of attack on their enemies.\n\nChief among them are the reform bureaucrats. Their leader Kaya has not given up on his dream of imposing a new order on Japan's economy, with or without political support. Independant deputies weigh the possible benefits from supporting him with the dangers of making an enemy of Ikeda and his conservative bloc. Independant deputies that have freed themselves of factional shackles are being dragged against their will back into the Yokusankai's civil war.\n\nThis dance between both sides is complicated by the emergence of a third power bloc. The indefatigable Takagi has struggled for quite some time now to establish a third path between the conservatives' stagnation and the reform bureaucrats' dangerous intertwining of government and industry. A small but growing liberal faction enthusiastically supports the former navy officer's program. By untangling the economy from Japan's political and military elites, the corruption and instability of the Yokusankai can be brought to an end. Once a dormant part of the conservative coalition, the liberal faction has been given a shot in the arm by the failure of both conservatives and reform bureaucrats to grab the prime minister's office. Smelling blood in the water, the liberals have begun dreaming with renewed vigor.\n\nThrough all this, rumors that former prime minister Kido Kōichihas not yet given up his radical agenda. While the majority of the reform bureaucrats support Kaya publicly, the perspective of a transformed Yokusankai remains a very appealing one. The fusion of total political and economical control with army backing remains an intoxicating idea among the chamber's most ambitious.\n\nNow, the rumor goes, all sides are preparing their move. It seems the interregnum ceasefire is ending."

 jap_interregnum.17.d:0 "The inclusion of the Japanese liberals into the Yokusankai came out of the darkest days of the war, where a united front of all Japanese politicians seemed indispensable. Victory did not bring liberalization of the economy, but an ever increasing bubble of economical development for the greatest Japanese conglomerates. Vast quantities of contracts with the government and the army brought endless resources to feed corrupt businessmen.\n\nThe liberals, once swept aside by a tidal wave of money and collusion, were thought to be absorbed in the Yokusankai's conservative faction. The very idea of opposing the army and the conglomerates looked impossible in the new Japan. But now, under the capable leadership of Takagi Sōkichi, the liberals have awoken. Their goal of securing the prime ministership looks like a pipe dream. The liberals command few members of the Yokusankai, and arrayed against them is the full might of Japan's economic establishment as well as the leaders of its army.\n\nAnd so, Takagi prepares an ambitious gambit. With a little help from his navy contacts, the reform bureaucrat's ties to the army could be exploited for political gains. On the other hand, many liberals stubbornly cling to Ino's conservative coalition. Why not attempt to peel off as many liberals as possible from the dying conservative faction? Both paths are fraught with risk, but desperate times require hard decisions."

By bringing forward a motion of censure in the chamber against Ino, Takagi hopes to dig more hole into the conservatives' sinking ship before Ikeda manages to right it. Passing such a motion is going to be a tall order; the tiny liberal faction will need to convince the remaining liberals within the conservative faction to join. Support from independents and reform bureaucrat will also be important. All the conservatives would need to do is poke a few points of this loose coalition to make it break down.

No matter. Tomorrow, the dominoes would fall. The Ino clique would no longer claim sole control over the Yokusankai. Not after today.\n\nTomorrow, the editor of the Shimbun would wake to this package on his desk.

This attitude does not translate so well to the rest of the Diet, whom the Ikeda Clique quickly sets out to recruit by means of what can only be described as 'throwing their financial weight around'. It can't be corruption if it's necessary for the preservation of the Nation, after all.\n\nIt turns out the Diet has little patience for the yes-men who watched their leader tie the Government to the hated Army-Navy complex, and over the next month 237 letters are received by various members associating themselves with Ikeda's agenda comparing them to traitors, militarists and Western double-agents. Kaya and Takagi even take a breather from their internecine strife to present a united front against Ikeda's antics. Representatives from both cliques lambast the Ino-worshippers, as they are coming to be known, as failures who deluded themselves into thinking the old methods are somehow going to save Japan by repeating its mistakes.

That he is really just a mouthpiece for a new form of military control, leveled over a helpless Diet and country. That he intends to purge the Kaya and Takagi cliques from power dominate the YSK - for if the old order was purged through fear and rumors and scandal, surely it intends to restore by force what has been lost? The speech is given first thing in the morning, and an already chill atmosphere in the Diet quickly turns fiery.\n\nThe speech does not go down well, to say the least. Inoites accuse their peers and each other of betrayal, the Kaya and Takagi cliques take token potshots at each other and chaos reigns within the tight confines of the Diet's reserved power structures. Representative turns against representative. As a particularly violent session of criticism of the Ino regime turns into an irregular fistfight between Politicians, the nation's cameras and press capture the image of a helpless Ikeda watching his clique turn into a glorified Yakuza chapter.

In Takagi's liberals, the admirals see a serious partner able to shake up the political situation. Word on the street is that several liberal politicians have been seen alternating between the Diet's chambers and the admiralty in the last few weeks. Speculation abounds; most bookmakers put their money on an intervention by the navy publicly condemning the army's ineptness in the Diet.

One after the others, the members of Takagi's clique have come out with reports, data, evidence and testimonies on the sheer dysfunction of the Army's economic work. And so the Navy and their liberal partners worked. Heavy pieces of evidence were screened by well rehearsed speeches and testimonies. Any attempt at counteracting the deluge of accusations ran into carefully placed rhetorical mines.\n\nThe only way for the army to salvage the situation was to come out with its own show of force.

While the conservatives have mostly pulled through the Navy criticism unscathed, the reform bureaucrat's grovelling to defend the army has not helped their image.\n\nThe liberals' partner in the business community have also greatly enjoyed the performance. The army makes a convenient scapegoat for economic ills brought in large part by concentration of power into the conglomerates. Unable to directly shake their rivals up, the second row of the Japanese business elite has decided that killing the special relationship between the Army and the titans of the Japanese economy is the best way to topple the latter. By bleeding repeatedly the nexus of corrupt money, the liberals continue to signal their free market chops to any potential partner.

After all, a man who suffers not the foolish is fundamentally disinclined to having his colleagues put on 'village idiot' kabuki masks and dance around each other, howling all the while. (Not that he has anything against kabuki dances, low-brow as they might be.) Day and night the Diet churns with intrigue, as the Sphere burns and its people plot - is this how Ino saw his nation going as he handed in his resignation letter?\n\nHe ponders the path ahead. Clean and symmetrical, like the katakana classes he used to do in his youth. He never liked those classes - the world was easier to handle than the infinite fall of a radical stroke. Some of those men in the Yokusankai were close to Ino, barely avoiding being dragged down with him. They might turn to Ikeda, if he plays his cards right. A speech in the Diet persuading those who still believe in the old way of things, of what the Chinese call wuwei, to stand firm might just throw him into the spotlight, and into a position where he can begin to fix things. On the other hand, Ino's clique has been badly compromised by the Scandal - it might be better to start over, to form a new party entirely, and the Liberals who aren't looking to Takagi have shown a somewhat conciliatory hand.\n\nIkeda thinks for long days and longer nights.

Not talking about something doesn't make it go away, of course, but to mention that would be in itself a faux pas, and so it is left untouched. This is Japanese politics: to artfully dodge questions when they are posed, to maintain respect for authority by remaining submissive to its abuses. Like all norms, it is widely adhered to, and that means it can be manipulated.\n\nIkeda takes the stage and starts to speak. He calls on the audience to remember the days of Ino: stability was messy and founded on complicity, but it was stable - and it was better than the present chaos. He outlines in some detail his own plan - by working with the Army (never collaborating or, gods forbid, submitting) and consolidating the Diet, it might be possible to reweave a whole cloth from the disparate threads of the factions. And he pauses - here his speech diverges, two separate threads unravelled from the same fabric. He can offer the usual 'generous concessions' as means of securing loyalty - but lately Ikeda has dreamt bigger dreams than mere loyalty. He has drafted a plan for a true reform of the Japanese Diet's clique-party system, one that will ensure the brokenness of the old system will never be repeated.

This attitude does not translate so well to the rest of the Diet, whom the Ikeda Clique quickly sets out to recruit by means of what can only be described as 'throwing their financial weight around'. It can't be corruption if it's necessary for the preservation of the Nation, after all.\n\nIt turns out the Diet has little patience for the yes-men who watched their leader tie the Government to the hated Army-Navy complex, and over the next month 237 letters are received by various members associating themselves with Ikeda's agenda comparing them to traitors, militarists and Western double-agents. Kaya and Takagi even take a breather from their internecine strife to present a united front against Ikeda's antics. Representatives from both cliques lambast the Ino-worshippers, as they are coming to be known, as failures who deluded themselves into thinking the old methods are somehow going to save Japan by repeating its mistakes.

That he intends to purge the Kaya and Takagi cliques from power dominate the YSK - for if the old order was purged through fear and rumors and scandal, surely it intends to restore by force what has been lost? The speech is given first thing in the morning, and an already chill atmosphere in the Diet quickly turns fiery.\n\nThe speech does not go down well, to say the least. Inoites accuse their peers and each other of betrayal, the Kaya and Takagi cliques take token potshots at each other and chaos reigns within the tight confines of the Diet's reserved power structures. Representative turns against representative. As a particularly violent session of criticism of the Ino regime turns into an irregular fistfight between Politicians, the nation's cameras and press capture the image of a helpless Ikeda watching his clique turn into a glorified Yakuza chapter.

Not that this privilege would ever be recognizable to more than a select fraction of the Diet. Who could put a price on respect, or the silent consent of grown men? Well, Ikeda can; and in a speech appealing to the Ino clique (sponsored by sympathetic members, the numbers of which are growing every passing day) he puts his own spin on the little tangle of patronage that binds them all. To be more exact, he slams the measure as blindingly stupid, destructive to actual governance and possibly one of the biggest factors leading to the fall of Ino himself.\n\nAn emperor never takes advice from courtiers well, especially if those courtiers have openly expressed ambitions to the throne. The leaders of the Clique scoff openly at the blind ambition and outrageous disrespect Ikeda is showing. This young upstart deserves little time and even less attention. Surely their fellow members will do the sensible thing and ignore Ikeda. After all, seniority only ever grows with age, and why would anyone endanger a growing asset by proposing reforms to the system which keeps the golden geese in line?\n\nA week later, the response of the clique is made clear in a 'rearrangement' of the Clique. In a show as material as it is symbolic, the clique's main body severs its membership with the club the Clique uses to host events for its leaders, and joins a new one - with Ikeda's name on the contract."

The old boys are, to use the proverbial saying, back in town. And a new wolf always hunts best with an old pack.\n\nChief on the new agenda being preached is the idea of internal Diet reform: slowly prising apart the network of patronage that made Japan so vulnerable to terrible decisions in the first place and replacing it with an actual choice-based system (the fact that this system would be headed by a man raised in and up by the Ancien Regime is ignored). Ideas are raised of continued collaboration with the Army and Navy, of working ties that are sustainable and preferably not immensely corrupt: of arms supporting each other rather than fending each other off. Of course, there is the China issue: but at present there is little time to do much other than make vague threats and consolidate control.

On another cold morning he begins this culling by officially severing all ties with the Inoites planning a restoration of the old order and a preservation of the YSK as Ino intended it. Shadows are heavy things, after all. Sever them and one is all the lighter, and sudden swerves far easier.\n\nThe sudden turn leaves his former base of support in Ino's Old Guardsmen in the dust, but many members of the various committees that have aligned themselves with Takagi's reformist agenda are beginning to consider their own interests. Reform is all very well and good, but with a more ...measured helmsman at the wheel it might be possible to moderate the change of course just enough to keep their positions (and their influence and money networks, of course). Takagi is fire, intense and corrosive and attractive, but Ikeda is measured and just stern enough to keep undesirable elements out of his clique - there is an adjacency to be milked here.

He promises them what the other cannot, like any good adulterer, making sure to hint with magnanimous silences what mere words prove insufficient to convey. Kaya and Takagi are about many things - but the only line connecting them all is self-interest, and a touch of duplicity. A newcomer is not bound by old strings, which leaves him freedom to operate - good for both reformers and men wary of disruption of the public peace.\n\nSlowly the centrists (if such a word is indeed appropriate to describe men in the Yokusankai) gather around Ikeda, finding in him a sympathetic, loyal and ultimately controllable figure. The last part is never mentioned in public, for obvious reasons, and certainly Ikeda has different ideas, but the latter will only come to fruition if Ikeda comes to power. For now there is the clipped-teeth teamwork of compromise, and the slow churn of the water, as the new raft angles its sides at the opposition coalescing against it.

The captain is no mere navigator or course-setter, in other words; he is a calculator, and in the end a gambler. Who could blame the planks of a ship for feeling a little suspicious of the captain's true motives?\n\nSo it is with Japanese politics. The first creak comes from an unnamed representative who demands proof that Ikeda's plan to reform the internals of Diet politics will actually come to fruition: the Japanese Government has stuck with a broken system so long precisely because it is a stable broken system. A captain is also a husband to an unwilling wife, and sometimes he must obey the one he presumes to lord over, lest he suffer for his actions in a thousand subtle ways. It is echoed by many in the Diet, even in Ikeda's own clique membership, who would very much like to be assured that the reform they have pledged themselves to support is not going to go the way of Yasuda's assets.\n\nIkeda is a captain, but no captain is ever fully in control. He wonders if he should show his clique his plans for internal reform - there is little reason why they should not start with themselves. For Ikeda there is little in the way of financial obligations tying himself and his party members together - to make a show of it would be to demonstrate his integrity and his lack of interest in betraying his own words.

But for many, the promise of just enough reform to keep things viable is tempting. Japan got here by keeping the Sphere in order, and without the Army there would be no Sphere. By extension, accommodation to the Army is not surrender, simply politics: and politics can be maneuvered, the tiger can be ridden without falling right off.

Thus, newspapers and commentators have reacted with little surprise when in an interview an embittered Takagi announced his complete retirement from politics - apparently, the old admiral will move back into his native home of Kyushu, far away from the centres of power in Tokyo.\n\nOf course, this comes as a major political victory for both Kaya and Ikeda, each releasing a statement congratulating Takagi for his long and honourable military and political career in service of Japan and of the Emperor. However, it's clear that both the national conservatives and the reform bureaucrats will descend upon the remnants of Takagi's faction - and inevitably, one of the two will dominate the Yokusankai."

The ambitious politician had emerged from the collapse of the Ino government to try to stop the destruction of the Conservative faction. He had made a valiant effort of it, and had nearly succeeded in re-securing the Prime Minister's seat for his faction. Now the Yokusankai conservatives find themselves under constant attack by the Liberals and Reform Bureaucrats. The schemes of Kaya and Takagi have further hollowed out the conservative's powerbase. None of the independent members of the Diet are willing to help Ikeda stabilize his position, and so the politician has thrown the towel.

He was asked if he supported either of the other two frontrunners, but while he made some vague hints he refused to openly endorse either one. He said he intended to continue serving Japan to his utmost ability, wherever it may be, when asked about his future plans. Then, he reached his car, and no more questions could be asked.\n\nWhile Kaya may have departed the race with dignity, the truth is simply that he was outmaneuvered. He did not leave the competition by choice, he rather saw that he just did not stand a chance any more, and rather than dragging his feet and refusing to give in, he chose to leave with grace so that he could return and fight another day. Let Ikeda and Takagi fight it out and take the next few years, and perhaps someday he could return to spar again."

The rhetoric from the national conservatives and the reform bureaucrats has been rising, with political confrontation escalating more and more - an all out battle has started for political domination within the Yokusankai, as Prime Minister Aichi can only stand and watch in silence. Kaya booms that Ikeda and his men are still the same gang of cronies that led Japan to stagnation and corruption in Ino's times; Ikeda answers that Kaya and his associates are a clique of wannabe dictators and traitors to the Kokutai, while rebuking the accusations of corruption.

While Ikeda Masanosuke has been shrouded in aloof quietness, not responding directly to the noise coming from Kaya, the situation is becoming dire - Ikeda must respond to the accusations, or succumb to Kaya's offensive.\n\nThe most obvious way for Ikeda to rebuke Kaya would be a direct appeal to His Excellency, the Prime Minister Kiichi Aichi. In the name of the greater good of Japan and of unity within the Yokusankai, Aichi can be asked to take a stand against Kaya's slanderous accusations against members of his own party - this would force the reform bureaucrats into silence, at least for a while. There's another option, however - rumors and whispers of a something not quite clean going on between Kaya himself and some prominent zaibatsus. It would be risky, but if Ikeda were to expose proof of Kaya's illicit activities to the eyes of Japan, it would mean knocking him and his clique out of politics for good.

Of course, current prime minister Aichi will be in the crosshairs too, for his failure to reign in Ikeda and his clique.\n\nAnother possibility is somewhat more unconventional. By going around the Diet and instead using contacts in the IJA, Kaya can attempt to gain the full support of the military against Ikeda, as well as trying to obtain enough evidence to rile up public support for an arrest mandate against Ikeda.

The intel gathered by Ikeda at the liaison conference was what prompted Ikeda's arrest, at the same time boosting Kaya to the position of Prime Minister.\n\nNow, Kaya Okinori stands on top of a renewed Yokusankai, purged of corruption, factionalism, and petty political schemes. At least, that's the image Kaya likes to paint to newspapers and television. In truth, much work is still to be done before Kaya can truly enact his grand reform schemes, but one thing is certain - the Interregnum is over, and a new age dawns upon Japan.

But now there is evidence to the contrary: by pulling on liberal arms and militarist coattails, Ikeda is forming a new administration that bears a disquieting resemblance to the old one. Motivated by promises of sincere but very moderate reform and a continued relationship with the Army, men loyal to the centre and the stability of the realm have flooded into his faction.\n\The same rumors which plagued the old Ino regime as it crumbled under old sins come to roost on the battlements here as well: corruption, failure, and so many accusations of military bootlicking Ikeda is forced to declare his neutrality on the Army-Navy issue in an awkward speech. But for many, the promise of just enough reform to keep things viable is tempting. Japan got here by keeping the Sphere in order, and without the Army there would be no Sphere. By extension, accommodation to the Army is not surrender, simply politics: and politics can be maneuvered, the tiger can be ridden without falling right off.

However, it was still wise for him to play to his base.\n\nAs such, Ikeda had prepared to address the YSK representatives, to outline his candidacy for Prime Minister. Knowing full well that he would mostly be speaking to fellow conservatives, he leaned heavily on reaserting his commitment to the status quo. To the rest of the party, he emphasised his qualities as a source of much-needed unity in the Taisei Yokusankai.To the conservatives of the Diet, Ikeda's speech had been exactly what they had been expecting, another reassurance that they were backing the right horse.\n\nYet there were some who whispered that Ikeda had perhaps emphasised his commitments to maintaining the current state of affairs too much. Was he Ino's successor in all regards, including his rather significant faults? Others within the YSK dismissed these suggestions as rubbish, fabricated entirely to sow doubt. It still remained to be seen if damage had been done, or if Ikeda's speech had reinforced his stronghold."

If it isn't broken, don't fix it, or at least that seems to be the line of logic that Ikeda is following. As tired as it may seem, however, even his foes will begrudgingly admit that the strategy still holds merit. To stray from the roots would be suicide at this point with how deeply entrenched they are in Ikeda's platform,and continuing to gather support from those who preferred the old order and those who simply fear change will not cease to be effective until those people stop existing. The same tired lines work for a reason."

This could prove to be either an effective blow or an opportunity for Takagi, depending on how effectively he responds. How he tries to parry this move could have a significant impact on the decision made on PM, even if it's something Ikeda has done a thousand times before. All he needs is to catch Takagi off guard once, and it's over.\n\nTakagi could simply do what he's always done. Same attack, same defense, the game continues and neither side gains. However, it's undeniably more appealing to try something more risky and actively counteract Ikeda's digging. There are two ways to go about it: either make a few compromises ideologically to gain more of Ikeda's change-fearing followers, or dig in just as hard as Ikeda did and attract more radical politicians who see everyone as too bland for them. Either one is risky but both could pay off."

Now, however, Ikeda must face his greatest challenge yet. He will not be wooing another nervous status quo advocate or meek third-rate advisor. No, now he must deal with Kōichi Kido, champion of reform and one of the biggest names in Japanese politics for many decades now.\n\nAt first, it would seem that Kido and Ikeda would be entirely opposed, with Ikeda being the stalwart defender of the status quo and Kido being perhaps the greatest advocate for reformism in the Empire. To a degree, that is true, but when facing foes like Takagi, the two could still perhaps find common ground. Takagi may want change, but his liberalism is the polar opposite of Kido's reformism, and with the right compromises Kido might just throw his support behind Ikeda in order to stop the liberals."

He had found many enemies doing this in the past, but none had stood up to his postulations in recent times more than the Takagites, who's rising power threatened the status-quo more than any he had seen before.\n\nAs much as it was an unlikely partnership, it was one that both could agree circumstances demanded. Kido was not one to congratulate Ikeda for his positions, nor pride him for what he fought for in the House of Representatives. However, confronted with what they both considered to be an overindulgent liberal faction, the conversations they had were united by a grim determination to put aside their differences and outmaneuver Takagi's influence for good.\n\nThe longer they talked, the greater a bond began to share. Despite their complex relationship in the politicking of the empire's legislature, they could both admit that it became of the utmost necessity to block the advances of the Takagites in the National Diet. Eventually, the smiles they shared in their winding discussions became more memorable than their huffs. Were Takagi to catch wind of this unofficial alliance, the confrontation in the Diet would set up a great defense against the threat of his faction's startling ascendancy."

There isn't any point in dancing around it; the time to strike is now, and the only course with any chance of victory is to strike directly at the core of power in the Empire.\n\nRight now, Takagi is simply moving his pawns into place.

Takagi's advances in the Diet have become far more apparent in recent times; the number of members finding his proposals more than agreeable have begun to vastly increase in numbers, as the Admiral himself was making moves to quietly outmaneuver his rivals.\n\nIn the Diet, his face was unresponsive to the heckling of politicians and his expression was a dull calm, but it was clear that Takagi prided himself with a self-satisfaction that came with seeing his plans unravel across the chamber floor. Day by day, he convinced more and more members over to his side in an attempt to secure a majority over the divided factions of the Taisei Yokusankai. Even if he did aggravate his rivals, there could be no doubt in claiming that he was quickly becoming a master of the Diet.\n\nFaced with his rivals' capitalization of such a divided party, Ikeda grew sick of seeing Takagi's silently smug grins. The brewing anger churning within him would not let the Admiral see such a spiteful victory; Ikeda concluded that he too must engage in the mind-games played in the Diet, at least before Takagi ascended to power on the chance he could mutter "Check-mate.""

The Liaison Conference is a delicate dance, however, and a wrong move could be just as catastrophic.\n\nIkeda could, of course, simply dance along with Takagi, waltzing through the hurdles, dropping finessed hints and subtle statements to the Emperor's clique, earning support one whispered promise and one insincere smile at a time.\n\nOr he could take the ultimate gamble: Try to reach the Emperor himself.\n\nIt would be beyond risky, but it would demolish Takagi if it succeeded.

The people who surround the Emperor hold far more power than many give them credit for, and getting on their good side is still key to having any real power in this nation.\n\nTakagi has spent a very long time getting here, but now he still must tread very, very lightly. The Emperor is more than just a man, he is the spirit of Japan to many, and to try and deal with him and his clique like just another group of politicians would be absolute suicide.

This is the only opportunity remaining to directly move against Takagi, and Ikeda will have to make it count.\n\nThe methods, however, are all difficult. The brief idea to try and reach the Emperor first was clearly a mistake, and there will be no attempt at that idea. That leaves two plans of action. While it would be tempting to start playing the palace games like Takagi, it's valuable time that could be spent on the Diet and all other facets of Japan's politics.

It could have been the usual, a deal gone bad over some Manchurian Poppy, some 'chankoro' killed for bad blood, He'd seen the likes. But this was different. The report read like a guide for the perfect murder. No prints, no discernable weapon, no signs of forced entry. Just a corpse mixed in with 2 tons of tuna.\n\nFinally, he arrived at the warehouse and crawled underneath the police lines. Whoever did this had a strong stomach, cutting his face up like that, he mused. Unrecognizable. The detective leaned down next to him, getting a closer look at his face.

Only a few hours prior this place had been dark and still, now it was filled with the hustle and bustle of police officers and forensic specialists.\n\nAs always, documenting every aspect of the scene would take time, and if done too quickly, it might fail to capture what they needed at all. In cases like these, so deliberate in their planning and execution, no detail was too small or too novel to be ignored, each one could be the difference between a breakthrough and a dead end.

But there was one worker who had been around, and in fact, he was the reason the call came in the first place. The dispatcher who sent the first squad had received the call from someone claiming to be a worker at the plant from a nearby payphone. He claimed to have seen someone suspicious on the plant's grounds and was worried about an attempted break-in. After giving the address of the plant and his name, he said he would wait near the entrance to the plant for the police to arrive.\n\nSure enough, when the squad car pulled up to the front gate the man was waiting there, huddled against the chill of the night air in his brown leather jacket. He showed the responding officers where he had seen the shadowy figure but they could not find any evidence of external tampering. Unconvinced, the man informed the officers that he was a shift lead and held one of the sets of keys to the plant, so they could check inside if they like. Seeing no harm in it, the officers accepted and followed the man into the darkened building, and the rest was history.\n\nIt may not seem like much, but with only one known witness to be found, the worker's testimony could be critical."

It was a grim reminder of the caliber of the crime and of the criminal who carried it out. Just from the first glance one could tell it was not a hot-blooded murder of passion and rage, but a merciless case of cold cruelty.\n\nThe first task had been to remove the body from the vat of now-spoiled fish it was found in. The act itself had not posed much of a challenge, but the aftermath did. The forensics specialists had to carefully separate the oily pieces of fish carcass from the grisly gore of the victim centimeter by centimeter, taking care not to erase any potential evidence. Slowly but surely, as the fish was stripped away more details emerged from the ravaged corpse.\n\nMost notably, there did not appear to be many signs of resistance on the part of the victim, despite the horrifying nature of the injuries. There were no abrasions to the knuckles to indicate a struggle, nor were there any on the wrist to suggest the victim had struggled against some restraints. In fact there were hardly any blows from blunt objects anywhere on the body, which likely would have required in order to subdue the victim while the more precise and painful aspects of the crime were carried out. These absences suggested something on their own however, the victim had likely been killed in the first few stabs, with the rest of the damage being applied post-mortem.

Whoever had done the deed had ensured to be as careful as possible, or they were an especially diligent cleaner. Dreading the thought of repeating the same process in other areas of the plant, the detective stepped outside to examine the grounds as well possible points of entry.\n\nAs he stepped outside and began walking towards the south end of the massive concrete building, he smelled something, the faint sharp odor of burning paper. As he drew closer, the smell grew stronger, but there was no accompanying smell of burning tobacco that would have suggested a cigarette as its source. Hurrying now, he jogged around the corner of the plant and followed his nose past some piles of crates and boxes, until he found the source, a pile of smoldering papers, starting to curl and blacken from the heat of the flames.\n\nThe detective sprinted over to the stack and began stomping at the flames until they guttered out and sent small streams of smoke up to the night sky. The detective then gingerly picked up the damaged files, brushed off the dirt that had previously been on the bottom of his shoe, and began to read."

After the detectives and specialists had left the scene for the night, the officer had been diligently patrolling the grounds, on high alert for any sign of the killer returning to the scene of the crime. But as he made his way behind the plant, he found what they had missed.\n\nA small pile of ashes on top of faint scorch marks on the ground, long since cooled by the night air and already beginning to spread over the surrounding area, motivated by the infrequent gusts of wind. Among the ashes there were a few scraps and shreds of paper, some of them with marginally discernible writing on them. From the various bits that were found that could still be read, it was obvious that the papers had once been files or records of some sort, and they had been burned extremely recently. But where had they come from? Was this the killer's true objective and the murder was just incidental? Or were they related? Either way, the detective wasn't going to leave it up to chance."

He had been speaking to a pair of deputy officers when the detective approached. After introductions, the detective pulled his notepad and pen from his pocket, and the man began his story yet again.\n\nAccording to the worker, after the plant closed last evening he and a few coworkers went out for drinks at a local bar a few blocks away, as they tended to do from time to time. While they were walking, they happened to pass a man in faded military fatigues with a long scar above his eye passing the other way. At the time, of course, this was nothing special. But later that night, after the coworkers parted ways, the man had to walk back past the plant the other direction to get home. As he walked past the entrance of his workplace, he happened to gaze through the chain link fence that surrounded it. And there, illuminated by a chance ray of moonlight, was the scarred military man, hurrying towards the far side of the main building.\n\nWhen the witness gave all that he could, the detective clicked his pen, folded his notebook closed, thanked the man for his time, and turned back towards the plant."

That meant that for the most part they would be able to provide very little detail about the circumstances of the crime when the detective came knocking. However one worker, a shift lead, had been passing by the plant on his way home when he happened to see a suspicious figure on the property, and then decided to call the police. When the responding officers arrived he let them inside to search the premises, where they found the body. While the detective and forensic teams worked the site he had stayed to give his statement but left not long after.\n\nEager to get a more detailed and complete testimony, the detective got his name from the deputies who took his statement and confirmed it against the name the dispatcher received during the initial call. Over the next few days he made several calls to the shift manager's listened number while intermittently interviewing other workers, but each time received no reply. Eventually the detective got fed up and went to the man's address in person to confront him. But when he got there he found the front door slightly ajar. After calling out a few times and identifying himself as police, the detective pulled his pistol from its holster and carefully entered the house.\n\nIn the first room past the front hall, the detective found the shift manager, laying face down in a pool of partially-dried blood."

At the request of the detective, the body was to be taken directly to the morgue where he would oversee the autopsy personally. Three officers with thick latex gloves and facemasks carefully lifted the corpse out of the vat and onto the stretcher. But as they laid the deceased man down onto the platform, one happened to notice something peculiar, something appeared to roll around inside the man's abdomen, causing a strange bulge right next to one of the largest wounds.\n\nWondering if some fish had found its way into the body's chest cavity, the officer pulled open the wound to get a better look inside. But it was not a condensed ball of tuna, rather it was a military issue hand grenade, entangled in a mess of wires leader deeper into the crevices of the corpse. Fortunately, after the initial shock the officer had the good sense to scream for everyone to get out of the building and to call the bomb squad.\n\nForty five minutes later, the bomb squad re-emerged from the plant and confirmed it was safe to go in, thanking the forensics experts who 'volunteered' to assist them. Unfortunately, the bomb squad had been much more concerned with defusing the explosives than they were with preserving the integrity of the evidence on the body. But all that soon became irrelevant, when the detective began looking over the components removed from the corpse and found a fingerprint right beneath the ring of the grenade."

The detective had done his part of finding the body, so he sent on to the morgue like he always did, saw it loaded into the back of the ambulance like he always did, and turned to other business like he always did.\n\nThe ambulance drove for about five minutes before the bombs that had been stuffed in the corpse's chest cavity went off. Of course everyone heard the blast right away, but by the time the police arrived on scene, all that was left was a smoldering wreck. Two medical workers and a police officer had been in the back when it went off. After an hour of work their bodies were pulled from the wreckage, shredded by shrapnel, their blood mixing with the splattered gore of what remained of the body.\n\nBy some miracle, the driver of the ambulance managed to survive the initial blast. They found him collapsed a few meters from the driver side door, having pulled himself away from the ruined ambulance. The detective held the driver's hand while bloody tears ran down his cheeks as he cried that he couldn't see out of his left eye or feel his legs, and promised him it would be ok as he was loaded into another ambulance, crying out the names of his wife and children.\n\nAfter six hours of surgery, the driver was pronounced dead."

It was no wonder that the killer had wanted the files destroyed, as they were essentially the blueprints of the crime itself. First and foremost was a profile of the victim, identified in the files as Shinji Yoshikage, a local taxman employed at one of offices in Tokyo. The files gave a rough description of him and his habits, alongside a slightly blurry headshot. It detailed his usual route to work and his typical schedule, not so clearly that one could trace it exactly, but clear enough to indicate that Yoshikage had been watched.\n\nThe files also gave some information about the fish plant where the body had been found however. The name, address, hours of operation, and grounds layout were all provided in a series of curtly typed notes. Given how complete the description of the property was, combined with the details about work schedules and routines, it was also clear that someone with insider knowledge of the plant had been involved.\n\nIt seemed obvious the killer had been assisted by at least one other party. If it had been the killer himself who knew this information, why bother to bring it with him to the scene of the crime? But who could have been in a position to help the killer, and why would someone involved with a fish plant want to kill a taxman?"

But really this was no great loss, because most were either already unreadable or contained contextless words or fragments of sentences that provided no leads or useful information.\n\nThe only things that were somewhat readable were the centers of a few pages from the latter half of the pile. Their headers and margins had been swallowed up by the flames, encircling the remaining text in black rings. Unfortunately, this meant there were no names or otherwise identifying information to be found among the lucky survivors. All they gave were some rough descriptions of the fish plant and its operation, nothing to suggest why it had been chosen for the crime. One thoroughly burned scrap made a few references to payment, but gave no context to suggest that it was concerned with anything more than standard business transactions.\n\nWith nothing else to be done, the detective begrudgingly placed the ashen pages back into their dedicated environment-proof bag and returned them to the evidence locker. Despite the flames, the lead had gone cold."

 japleadup.13.d:0 "While the description of the suspect that the plant worker had given to the detective was certainly informative, it could only go so far in a city like Tokyo. There could have been thousands of people who matched that description just within a few kilometers of the plant. In order to narrow down the possibilities, the detective decided to focus on the most distinguishing part of the description, the military uniform. At first, the detective was conflicted, was it really likely that the suspect was an active soldier?\n\nThe worker's description of a noticeable scar did provide some support for that line of reasoning, as it very well could have been some kind of combat wound. But why would he wear his fatigues during the act? Wouldn't that only make it easier to track him down if he was seen?\n\nBut maybe, the whole point was for him to be recognized as a member of the military. Maybe, some part of the crime was contingent on the killer's military position, or it was part of the way he made contact with co-conspirators. And beyond all that, perhaps its allowed for some plausible deniability, a soldier on short-term leave with nothing but his fatigues. Ostensibly the military held a record of every soldier on requested leave and where they would be, it couldn't hurt to check who was kicking around Tokyo."

 japleadup.14.d:0 "Unfortunately, the shift worker was left in a grisly state similar to that of the victim. His chest and stomach were covered in nearly a dozen slashes and stab wounds. His neck bore a matching wound, deep and savage, likely the final wound that had drained the life from the poor man. And once again, the same ominous mark appeared gouged into flesh and accented by dried blood, 'Chinmoku', 'Silence'. This time however, rather than being proudly and boldly displayed in the center of the chest, the shift worker's mark was etched into his left shoulder.\n\nBut where the previous victim's character had been smooth and deliberate with neatly traced lines, this one was shaky and jagged. The killer must have been in a hurry, the detective concluded, basing his judgement off the comparatively sloppy work. This wasn't a carefully planned, premeditated murder, this was on a whim, or perhaps, out of necessity.\n\nBut beyond the sign of the killer's gruesome haste, there was little more to be gleaned from the body. It seemed speed did not quite translate to carelessness on the part of the killer. Still, the splatters and drops of blood found around the entryway demonstrated that this had been no simple task. The shift lead must have fought every step of the way against his vicious assailant, fiercely resisting him from the moment he burst through the door right up until his collapse into his final resting place on the living room floor."

 japleadup.15.d:0 "With great care on the part of the forensics team, they managed to triple the quantity of evidence found from the bomb components retrieved from the corpse. In total they found three fingerprints, one just beneath the ring of the grenade, another on its handle, and a lone thumbprint on its base. As for the rest of the parts, nothing else could be found on them, it seemed that whoever had assembled the bomb had become careless at the critical moment, perhaps overcome with the fear of handling live explosives.\n\nIn terms of sheer force, the bomb itself was nothing extraordinary, it was nothing more than a hand grenade and a few gunpowder charges crudely wired to a rudimentary timing device. By the bomb squad's estimation, had they not noticed the bomb when they did it likely would have gone off within the half hour, a fortunate break to say the least. Likey it was not meant as some form of convoluted terror attack, but as a means of destroying evidence, with the added benefit of another layer of intimidation. But what the bomb lacked in power it made up for in its alarming nature, how was it that a military issue grenade could appear here of all places?\n\nTo answer that question, the detective could only turn to the aforementioned fingerprints, which of course entailed the long and arduous task of visually comparing the prints with the nearly endless collection in the Tokyo Police Records. With nothing else to be done, the detective sighed as he picked up the case files from his desk, and began the long march to the records room."

It had been an ordeal of in itself just to separate the shredded remains of their coworkers and the splattered gore of the victim's corpse. To make matters worse, much of what had not been blasted or torn away had been charred and burned by the flaming ambulance, further desecrating the bodies of the innocent and practically destroying any hope of retrieving evidence from the body itself.\n\nAs for the bomb that had caused the horrifying blast, very little of it was left in any useful capacity. What had not been scattered to the winds by the initial explosion had been blackened beyond recognition by the flames. But, by some miracle stroke of luck, a single salvageable piece of evidence was preserved. Inside the chest cavity of the victim, now exposed to the open air by a vicious wound, they found a particular piece of shrapnel embedded within its bloody walls. The shrapnel was much like all the others, save for the row of characters stamped into the metal. A military serial number, the same kind that could be seen on any of the tens of thousands of grenades, bombs, and shells that flowed in and around Japan and the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nBut beyond that one string of numbers and letters, the bomb had succeeded in its purpose, the body lead had reached its bloody end."

 japleadup.17.d:0 "After poring over and analyzing every line of the slightly singed papers, the detective at last came to final page in the stack. It was folded in half, an uneven crease running horizontally across the page. The bottom right corner had been almost entirely burned away, leaving a ring of blackened paper in its place. As the detective opened it to read, some of the more brittle pieces of the charred page broken off, disintegrating into dust as they spun towards the floor.\n\nIt was little more than a simple note, lines of slightly faded typewriter text organized into a unimpressive paragraph. But as the detective ran his eyes over each character and absorbed the meaning of the text line by line, the note quickly became the most important paper in the pile.\n\n'Per our arrangement, you are scheduled to meet our associate at exactly seven minutes past noon, where the disposal equipment will be returned to you. Our associate has been told to expect a man wearing basic military fatigues, brown shoes, and a facial scar above the right eye, ensure you strictly adhere to this description. Furthermore, we have repeatedly reminded you to avoid contact with your brother in the police force in the interest of security, and we hope we agree it would be in the interest of all parties if he were not involved. We sympathize with your concerns, Mr Takahara, however we assure you that when the job is complete, you will be paid for your time.'" 
 japleadup.17.a:0 "I guess it really isn't personal, huh."
 japleadup.18.t:0 "The Mysterious Military Man"
 japleadup.18.d:0 "As the detective had expected, the military did indeed maintain records of all the soldiers who had been granted leave, and the local office was happy to allow him to view those records, under supervision of course. What the detective did not anticipate however, was the sheer number of soldiers that encompassed. Initially he was faced with a stack of paper so daunting the lead likely would have gone cold before he was halfway through. To save time, the detective was forced to rely on his hunch and narrow his request to only those on a short term leave.\n\nEach record was nothing more than a piece of paper with a few blocks of text in the center and a slightly-blurred picture of the soldier it concerned in the top right. They all contained nothing more than the soldiers name, unit, length of requested leave, place of residence during leave, and start and end date of leave. Over the course of several hours, the detective flipped his way through the stack, quickly scanning the details and comparing the picture to the descriptions in his notebook, before placing it in one of two piles. Before long, the detectives 'rejected" pile was much, much larger than his 'possible' pile, with the few in the latter pile nothing more than distant approximations.\n\nBut just as he was about to give up, he flipped on more page and found a man with a scar above his right eye frowning back at him. The man was Ryo Takahara, a private in the Army on leave for one week, starting two days before the body was found. But when the detective went to check the listed place of residence, he found that while it was registered to a Takahara, it was not this Takahara. Rather it was the home of Ryo's brother, a police officer in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police service." 
 japleadup.18.a:0 "Maybe the brother can produce an alibi?"
 japleadup.19.t:0 "The Redacted Record"
 japleadup.19.d:0 "Much to the detective's delight, the process of comparing and matching the fingerprints had taken less time than he anticipated. By working just a handful of junior officers to the bone for a few days, he had managed to compile a stack of probable matches and their corresponding files. Of course, most were rough approximations and they were limited to those who had their fingerprints on file already, but there was little else that could be done.\n\nMost of the profiles from the potential matches were typical Tokyo criminal lowlife. Thugs and drug dealers, low level gangsters and enforcers, the prototypical scum that the police force fought against. But while most certainly fit the character profile, none had any obvious meaningful connection to the particular circumstances of the crime. But for one such record, that lack of detail only drew more suspicion. There was on set of prints that matched those found on the bomb quite closely, debatably the closest of them all. But the only file it corresponded to was a single redacted arrest record, the original source of the prints.\n\nBoth the name and circumstances of the crime had been struck from the record, generously coated in black ink bars that dotted the page. Beyond that there was no reason given for why the record had been censored, no accompanying paperwork or notice of change. The only pieces of identifying information were the picture of unnamed man, an average sized man with short black hair and a scarred gas above his right eye, and the name of the filing officer, some Takahara down at the central police station. Perhaps he would be able to offer some insight."

 japleadup.20.t:0 "The Interrupted Meeting"
 japleadup.20.d:0 "Tracking down Officer Takahara was easy enough, his schedule for the day had him scheduled to be on-call from the Tokyo Central Police Station itself. The Detective felt somewhat weird about confront a fellow police officer about a crime of this caliber. However he figured that the officer would be able to provide some alibi or correct some misunderstood detail on their part. So, he gathered up a small squad of officers and a fellow detective, and made their way down to the Central Station.\n\nOnce there, with a quick flash of their badges and stern relaying of their intent, they were waved past the front desk and towards the general officer's hall. At first, the group could not seem to find Officer Takahara amidst the regular daily hustle and bustle of the station's officers, but one of his colleagues was kind enough to inform them that Takahara had stepped out back for a smoke break. With a curt thank you, the detective turned to the door at the far end of the room that led to the back entrance of the station, his team following behind him. When he pushed the heavy metal door open he saw no sign of Takahara, but heard some hushed words float from around the corner.\n\nNot waiting for the rest of his team to come through the door, the detective briskly rounded the corner in search of the source of the voice. There he found himself face to face with Officer Takahara, who himself had been locked in conversation with another man who looked quite like him in passing, save for the deep scar above his right eye. There was a brief moment of silence as the three men stared at each other. But it lasted no longer than the time it took for the them to reach for their weapons. The first sound was nearly the detective's shout of 'police', but it was just barely beaten out by a gunshot."

 japleadup.21.d:0 "The detective's vision was blurry, the shapes and colours of the world merged and melded with each other. With each blink his eyelids became heavier and heavier, flicking his vision between indiscernible fog and total darkness. But for a moment, with a great amount of effort on the detective's part, his vision became clear. He saw the scarred man in front of him, face down against the hard concrete ground. His hands were cuffed behind him and the boot of a police officer was placed squarely on his back. Turning his eyes a bit, he could see a small pool of bloody forming beneath him, trickling out of a dark hole in his leg.\n\nThe detective also became aware of the that fact the world around him was quite loud. The sounds appeared distant and garbled, but he had been so focused on looking he had hardly noticed them at all. With yet more effort, the detective strained to hear the sounds of surroundings. First he heard the groaning of the scarred man in front of him, soft and indistinct. Next came the repeated pops and cracks of gunfire, accompanied by the occasional wizzing of bullets and rumbles of impact. Finally, he turned to see one of the officers that had accompanied him, crouched behind a crate and screaming into his radio. For a moment their eyes met, and he saw fear, confusion, and above all, loss. Then, as the detective's eyelids fell for one last time, the words he shouted became clear.\n\n'-requesting backup to our location immediately! We are taking fire from a police officer at the south-eastern exterior of the central station! Officer is down! I repeat, officer is down!'"

 #The Touchou
 japtouchou.1.t:0 "Stage Two"
 japtouchou.1.d:0 "The developments in the Toukkoku case that occurred while collecting evidence strongly suggested that the motivation for the murder is far more complex and calculated than initially thought. With the revelation that the killing itself was carried out by a former soldier, who had seemingly no obvious relation to the victim, the investigation took on a new character. Where the officers of the ward station once combed through the gory details of the case over tables and across desks, there was now only a stern silence. Hushed conversations were held behind closed doors, locks on filing cabinets were now checked and double-checked, and notebooks became carefully guarded realms of speculation and secrets.\n\nNo command or directive brough this culture of silence to the station, it was ushered in by the demeanor of the chief detective. He had steadily become more stoic and withdrawn as the days went by. Answers to previous questions spawned questions of their own, and before long the case loomed like a hydra over the department.\n\nGiven the general sense of turmoil, it was all the more surprising when the chief gathered the department before him one morning and announced that the investigation was moving to its next stage. The teams would be re-organized to shift away from field work, and focus on filling the holes in the case with paper. Each group would be responsible for interacting with, requesting, and securing information from a different administrative office. Most importantly, the specific objectives of, and information obtained by each group would be strictly localized, only known within the group and to the central command of the investigation. The chief did not offer a justification for that change, but none was really needed.\n\nAfterward, the detective paused to run his eyes over the rows of silent, stone-faced men before him, looking for any sign of concern or confusion. Finally, he broke the silence.\n\n'No questions?' he asked. But the stoic men kept their silence, glancing between themselves and the detective.\n\nOk then,' he continued. 'This is what we're going to do.'"

"Rather, we must take the opposite position, in a sense. We must carefully plan our actions before we make them, as well as anticipate and prepare for the result of said actions.'\n\nHe came to a stop, and turned to gaze over the uniformed officers assembled in the rows of chairs before him. He knew all their faces, the names that went with them, and the desks they normally appeared behind. Some of them were veterans of the service, officers and detectives who had given a large portion of their lives to the Tokyo Police Service. Others were newer, recent graduates from police academies, transfers from other departments, or military men who wanted a change of pace.\n\nWeighing this, the chief resumed. 'Previously we have used our obligation to enforce the law like a hammer, smashing aside all obstacles to reveal the information we desire. Here, however, the key is superior to the battering ram. The fierce rivalries between and within the branches of military and government have encouraged the growth of a culture of underhanded opportunism. It permeates through the offices and conference rooms of administration and clouds the judgement of those within. That is the weakness we must exploit, the conditions that motivated the crime will be its perpetrators' undoing.'\n\nWith that, he gathered his papers from the podium in front of him into a pile, straightened it with two quick taps against the podium, and walked from the meeting room. As soon as he disappeared from the doorway, his subordinates rose with a chorus of chair legs scraping against linoleum floors, and set to their tasks."

 japtouchou.3.t:0 "Friends of Friends in the Right Places"
 japtouchou.3.d:0 "Smoke from the chief detective's cigarette wafted towards the ceiling as he leaned back in his office chair. It rippled past the frosted glass windows that separated his office from the common area that housed the desks of the department's officers and detectives. Two of such detectives sat in front of him now, each in an uncomfortable metal chair half a meter away from the hulking mass of polished wood that served as the chief's desk.\n\nOne was senior detective Kodaira, a long-standing veteran of the Tokyo Police, his age beginning to show in the wrinkles around his eyes and the dusting of grey hairs on his head. The other was a younger man transferred from a department in Osaka, named Tachi. He had served as an officer for a number of years prior, followed by a handful more as a detective. While his senior remained somewhat relaxed in his chair, the young detective leaned forward to speak.\n\n'What I'm trying to say, sir,' he began. 'Is that given the circumstances it would make sense to establish an informal network inside key offices beforehand rather then try to build a network of contacts as we go along.'\n\nThe chief tapped his cigarette on the rim of a glass ashtray, one of the few things that sat on his his otherwise barren desk. 'What do you mean by informal?' he asked.\n\n'Unofficial connections mostly,' Kodaira interjected. 'Former contacts for old cases, friends of friends, old army buddies, whatever. People who we could ask to take care of the pen-and-paper tasks that bureaucrats are usually not so motivated to do. All with the understanding that their effort is deeply appreciated by the Tokyo Police Service, who will happily remember or forget their contributions, depending on what they prefer.'\n\n'And because of the rather sensitive nature of the operation,' Tachi said, 'we think it best to limit our network to one major government working group. Otherwise we risk alerting the conspirators if they find out half of their office goes down for coffee at the station once a week. For our purposes, we recommend either the Army, Navy, or Diet administrations, sir.'"

 japtouchou.4.d:0 "The chief detective sat behind his desk, carefully flicking through his roll of contact cards. Each card was given at least a moment's worth of attention, enough to read the name stamped on it in black ink. Most then were immediately flicked past and forgotten, but a few were worthy of a another moment of consideration, and fewer still made the detective pause altogether.\n\nHe searched for the names of people in the same way one would search for the name of a street. Unconcerned with the memories, thoughts, and feelings related to the names, only their usefulness as a path from one place to another. But the roads he sought led to the heart of the Imperial monolith, and were neither easily found nor traversed. Doubly so, in the case of the Tax Bureau and Board of Audit.\n\nThe Tax Bureau was the attack dog of the Ministry of Finance. Many aspiring gang leaders or captains of industry had their dreams dashed by the discerning gaze and careful calculations of its agents. The Bureau demanded information in torrents of paperwork, for 'accuracy, consistency, and redundancy', and had amassed a horde of data in an impossibly intricate filing system. It neared an intelligence agency in its own right, devoted to the single purpose of following and securing the revenue of the Empire.\n\nBy contrast, the Board of Audit was a reclusive agency, shunned by the ministries of the cabinet. This made little difference to its officials, in some sense it was preferable. They existed to examine the finances and records of the various public institutions that spread around the Empire. But the Board's position in the hierarchy was artificial, in a sense, they reported to the Diet but were subordinate only to the Emperor. While they acted with the Divine purpose of exposing the subversives who exploited the Empire for personal gain, and had done so in the past from time to time, in recent years the office had fallen silent.\n\nThe chief leaned back in his chair, juggling an unlit cigarette between his fingers. Two names now sat before him, one to each office. He considered for a moment longer, and then reached forward to pick up the phone."

 japtouchou.5.d:0 "Detectives Tachi and Kodaira stood under the canopy that covered the entrance to the Tokyo Central Police Station. They stood side by side, not quite facing each other but not quite facing away, their backs to the door. Each held a cigarette, Tachi in his left hand and Kodaira in his right, which they would raise to their lips every now and again. Between them, four cigarette butts sat crushed onto the ground.\n\n'How it seems to me,' said Kodaira, pausing to pull on his cigarette, 'is that we have two angles to approach this case at. One is through the killer himself, who he was, where he came from, how he ended up here, his tragic backstory, all that nonsense. The other, is through the circumstances of the killing, why did it happen where it did, when it did, and in the way that it did.'\n\n'And you think it's a matter of picking the right one?' Tachi asked.\n\n'That's just it,' replied Kodaira, eagerly inhaling another puff. 'If there really is a conspiracy, or at least one going further than we've found already, then none of those details would have been left to chance. What I mean is, it's not just about where those angles lead, it's about where they overlap.'\n\nTachi turned to look at him. 'So what do you suggest?' he asked.\n\n'Two teams, each of us leading one. One focuses on the criminal, the other on the crime. We keep the specifics local to our teams, but you and I meet privately to discuss, compare, and coordinate. Maximum coverage, minimal risk. And you know how much I enjoy rooting through the personal effects of the deranged and disturbed,' Kodaira said with a smirk. 'But I think I'll let you take the lead in that respect, seeing as you've yet to have the chance since you got here. Consider this an impromptu field lecture on Tokyo criminal psychology,' he said, bringing the remains of his cigarette back to his lips. Tachi flashed a quick smile smiled in reply, before he dropped the smoldering ends of his cigarette on the ground and crushed it beneath the sole of his scuffed leather shoes."

Three were police officers, each clad in a dark blue uniform and carrying a shining badge of office in a clip at their waists. The other two were detectives, Tachi and another recent transfer to the team. All of them leaned over a collage of files, documents, and pictures, carefully arranged in a half circle around a picture of Ryo Takahara.\n\n'So in total,' said Tachi, the other four men turning to face him as he spoke. 'We know three central things about Takahara here. First, that he killed Shinji Yoshikage in a very specific manner despite no apparent relation between them. Second, he is a member of the Armed Forces, very likely the Army. And third, he had a half-brother in the Tokyo Police Force willing to assist him.' The rest of the group nodded in reply.\n\n'So that gives us with two major avenues of investigation,' he continued. 'We have the military angle, finding out what the military knew about him and what he did for them. Or, we can cover the basics, as we would in a normal case. Establish a broader background, get a general sense of who he was as a person, what his social groups were, his habits, and so on. Regardless, our goal is to construct a motivation from his prior actions, and from there try and form a reasonable connection to further parties.'\n\nThree of the other men nodded again, but the fourth, a bright-eyed young officer from the south, cleared his throat to speak. 'Sir? Given the circumstances of that case, that is, the fact that the suspect had a brother on the police force, should we consider that an angle of investigation too?'\n\nTachi hesitated a moment, before replying, 'At this stage we are missing so much of the basic facts of the case that I don't think we can make real headway in a related internal investigation at the moment. If there is more to be found inside the force, going in blind will only make finding it more difficult. So with all that being said I propose we...'"

In all my years of experience, nobody has ever involved a vat of tuna in their plans by accident. Because of that, gentlemen, we will be taking nothing for granted in this case. For us, there is no such thing as the benefit of the doubt, the word coincidence has no use here.'\n\nNine member of the Tokyo Police Service sat in chairs, leaned against desk, or stood in a half circle in front of him. They were a mix of street officers, desk workers, and junior detectives. Some listened with blank, expectant stares, while other were stern and cold, frowning as the mulled over the senior detectives words.\n\n'With that said,' he continued, 'we will be conducting a thorough examination of the particulars of this case. The purpose of that examination is to answer the question of why. Why did the killing take place when it took place? Why was the victim disfigured in the way that he was? And most of all, why did our suspect pick that particular tuna vat out of all the tuna vats in Tokyo. Those are the questions I want answers to, and trust me, I will get my answers one way or another.' He let the last sentence settle over his men, gauging their reactions, or lack thereof.\n\n'To achieve that goal, there are two paths that have been laid before us. We can go low, down into the factory floor and see what we can pull from the fish guts and bones. Or, we can go high, up to the owners and financiers of the whole operation, and see how far the paper trail takes us.

The Imperial General Headquarters, the administrative office that the straddled the chasm between the Army administrations, was initially willing to cooperate with the investigation without much bother. But in reality they could merely point the investigation towards the relevant branch, in this case the Army, who maintained sole administrative responsibility over Takahara's files. From then on, the efforts of the team were completely subject to the whims of the IJA Personnel Bureau.\n\nFor days on end, the desk workers of the investigative team filled out forms, made phone calls, issued requests, re-submitted forms, all while making sure to file everything in triplicate. No amount of pressure or intimidation seemed to have any effect on the staff either. Such efforts were met with monotone voices over phone calls and glazed eyes in person. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a courier arrived early one morning, clutching a package sealed in a black plastic cover. After he checked and re-checked Detective Tachi's ID, he reluctantly handed him the package before retreating back to the Tokyo streets.\n\nThe package contained Takahara's basic military files, including those regarding his recruitment evaluation, training, and performance records. The files confirmed much of what was already suspected. Takahara had joined almost immediately after finishing school, and was quickly sent to basic training. There, he passed his training regime without issue and was cleared for active service. His psychological and performance reports revealed more noteworthy information, however. His superiors regarded him as 'jumpy' and even at times 'overly eager', but he was also praised for his quick adherence to orders and lack of hesitation in simulated combat.\n\nThe last of the files stated that he had been stationed in northern Indonesia a year ago, as part of an Imperial 'Security Battalion' deployed to the region.

His desk lamp provided a small pool of light, illuminating Tachi as if he were an actor upon a stage. Looking outside the windows, the sky was as dark as the office. But even at this hour, light from the cars, signs, and streetlights of Tokyo poured through the glass and drew shadows on the walls of the station.\n\nTachi looked back down at the papers arrayed on his desk before him.

The intention had been to begin compiling the next day, but Tachi chose to stay late to begin the process himself, not having any spouse or children to return to like some of his colleagues.\n\nBy all accounts, Takahara was thoroughly average. He had been an average student, both in conduct and exams. He had chosen to enlist in the general infantry corps after his final year of school, with no obvious intention of pursuing a specialized role or command. He had been picked up twice for bar fights, but it never amounted to anything more than a night in custody. The only noteworthy thing in that respect was an arrest six months ago for the possession of illegal substances. However, no further information was given in the report, and it seems he was released the next day without incident.\n\nThe detective frowned. None of the other files had implied anything related to drugs. But Takahara's medical records were not included in the bundle, as the records were not centralized and tended to move as the patient did, requiring some effort to track down. Of course, Tachi could not help but notice the curious police record. An apparent repeat offender was consistently let go even after more severe charges were applied. In all likelihood, this was the work of the brother, Officer Takahara, suggesting there was more to their cooperation."

 japtouchou.10.d:0 "Nobody, not even Detective Kodaira, could say that the management of the Toukkoku fish plant did not comply with the warrants they had been served. Just two days after the investigative team had requested the transfer of critical files from the plant, they arrived. But they did not come in a series of folders, binders, and envelopes as the team had expected, rather they appeared at the reception of the station in four large cardboard boxes, their bottoms sagging under the weight of the papers within them.\n\nWhat the team found within them would have made the most experienced accountant faint and driven the most determined auditor to suicide. Endless piles of paper, the overwhelming majority falling in that sweet space between 'useless' and 'nonsense'. The cream of the crop was the special few which benefited from either the structure of being typed with a typewriter, or the neatly printed designs of standardized forms. The rest were a nightmare. Hundreds of illegible handwritten forms, dozens upon dozens of half-completed documents making reference to other half-completed documents, all floating in a sea of contextless, meaningless notes and reports.\n\nEvery facet of the plant contributed to this monstrosity. Management and staff files were mixed together carelessly, each individual's reports jammed together in no particular order. Finance reports were lumped together in one pile, it made no difference if the money was incoming or outgoing, it did not matter if it was allocated for raw resources, wages, or shareholder payouts. The whole plant seemed to be enveloped in a whirling vortex of haphazard bookkeeping.\n\nWith the investigation reaching nowhere quickly, Kodaira intervened. He declared that in order to conduct a proper audit, the team would shift to focus on one particular aspect of the plant, rather than it as a whole."

 japtouchou.11.d:0 "The investigative team began by collecting and reviewing any and all easily accessible public information regarding the plant where Shinji Yoshikage's body had been found. This included everything from the plant's articles of incorporation and bylaws, to their land and development permits. The plant's official name was the Toukkoku Regional Seafood Processing Facility, a name which rolled off the tongue like a brick on a plain. It had been established five years prior, the property had previously been an abandoned warehouse but was quickly converted into its current industrial state at the whim of a plucky investor.\n\nSaid investor went by the name of Morihiro Soejima, a local Tokyo socialite and entrepreneur. He was the direct owner and operating manager of the plant, but it seemed that in recent years most of the day to day operations of the plant were administered by a series of lower level managers. During that time, Soejima had been busy starting and launching a host of other businesses in and around Tokyo, ranging from other food processing plants to naval equipment factories. At first the team was skeptical of how this was possible, given the relative cost of opening and converting properties verses the profits they generated. But two facts came to light that provided easy explanations.\n\nFirst, the plant, in addition to all the other properties opened by Soejima, were part of a wider consumer-industrial conglomerate, named the Minezaka Koushou Kabushiki Gaisha. It was immediately obvious that the conglomerate provided the necessary capital and backing to support the ambitious expansion plans. Second, Morihiro Soejima was the eldest son of Shinzo Soejima, a respected member of the prestigious and powerful Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, Tokyo's primary legislative body. Either of these facts could have been connected to the motivation behind Yoshikage's symbolic murder, perhaps the end result of industrial espionage or political subterfuge. Regardless, the team was forced to consolidate their efforts and focus on the chosen approach."

 japtouchou.12.d:0 "While securing the first set of files from the firm grasp of the Army had been difficult, it paled in comparison to the effort to retrieve the most recent files. Every single day some new issue was raised that ground the investigation's progress to a halt. Every single day some new form needed to be filled out or some official needed to be corresponded with. A detective would submit a request form one day, only for it to be returned a few days later, with a note stating a list of departments the form needed to be sent to simultaneously in order for it to be considered. All along the way, representatives from the Army scrutinized the investigation and their motives. They cited potential issues in security and demanded to know the relevance of and justification for retrieving the files.\n\nBut finally, with the endless trading of paperwork reaching a stalemate, an agreement was reached. Detective Tachi and his fellow detective would be granted access to the files in a secure room at the IJA Regional Staff Headquarters in central Tokyo. They would not be permitted to remove the files, but they would be allowed to record any information they deemed relevant, while under supervision of course. Early the next morning, Tachi and his partner strode through the doors of the HQ, each with a small stack of notebooks under their arms. Six hours later, they re-emerged.\n\nSix months ago, Ryo Takahara enrolled in an explosives certification training course. The primary purpose of this course was to groom soldiers stationed throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere for anti-insurgent units, specializing in IED identification and defusal. Takahara had never expressed interest in joining such a unit, both before and after he undertook the training. Clearly, the team concluded, the only motivation he had to take this course was as preparation for planting the corpse bomb discovered during the initial investigation. It was also clear that the Army had played some role in this case. They had provided the necessary skills, intentionally or otherwise, now it was time to see if they had provided the equipment."

 japtouchou.13.d:0 "As expected, finding Takahara's medical records in the webwork of Japanese bureaucracy was no easy task. Many times Detective Tachi's team tracked them to one clinic or office, only to find yet another notice of transfer. However eventually, through sheer persistence and a great deal of patience, half a decade's worth of records made their way to the desks of Tokyo Central.\n\nThe basic details were generally unsurprising. The records described a physically healthy young man, both by civilian and military standards. The statistics lined up with those recorded in the autopsy, and they seemed to be consistent between each individual file. But the more recent records revealed a pair of intertwined complexities. At some point in the previous years Ryo had begun to spiral into what the doctors had referred to as a 'persistent depressive state'. He described consistently low moods, trouble eating and sleeping, and an increasingly withdrawn disposition. Most notable, the only break in the downward trend seemed to come around eight months ago, when Ryo expressed excitement over rekindling the relationship with his brother.\n\nBut the revelations did not end there. A handwritten note was found shoved in the back of folder containing medical records dated six months ago. It appeared to have been written by the doctor who had examined Takahara, whether it was intended for his own or his patient's reference, was unclear. Three pieces of information were written on the note, the words 'West Tokyo Behavior Clinic', a phone number, and an address. After consulting a phonebook, the team confirmed that all three of those things pointed to the same place. It was a specialized treatment clinic, aimed at combating 'social diseases' such as antisocial behavior, alcoholism, and drug abuse.\n\nWhile the specific purpose of the recommendation was not immediately clear to the team, for once their next move was."

 japtouchou.14.d:0 "At a glance, Officer Takahara and his brother, Ryo Takahara, looked quite similar. They both had dark brown eyes, short cut black hair, and had almost the same physique. But as was usually the case, the longer one stared at the two men, the more the individual subtleties stood out. Almost the same could be said of their respective lifestyles. On the surface they were both men of law and order, Ryo as a soldier and his brother as a police officer. But again, a casual glance over the details revealed the key points of differentiation. Both men seized upon their upon their respective opportunity with what seemed to be entirely different intentions. For Ryo, it served as a means to escape what he saw as the drudgery of civil life. But for his brother, the purpose was the opposite, it was a means to propel himself upwards in the social environment he found himself in.\n\nIndeed, where Ryo had a tendency to meander around the middle ground, his brother tended to shine. Officer Takahara was highly regarded within the Tokyo Police Service, particularly for an officer who had served only three years until that point. His records contained a long list of commendations from his superiors and public officials, but lacked a single citation.\n\nWhat Officer Takahara's records also lacked however, was any reference to the incidents involving his brother. If he had been involved in preventing any charges from sticking to Ryo, he was careful to ensure he did so quietly. In fact, his records contained no reference to Ryo at all, not even a casual indication that he had a brother. In order to gain any insight into the circumstances surround the arrests, the investigation would need to refine their search. Detective Tachi ordered his team to collect and review the files specifically pertaining to Ryo's arrests, as well as any and all that included or mentioned Officer Takahara. As it would turn out, that was a lot."

 japtouchou.15.t:0 "Employee Review"
 japtouchou.15.d:0 "The staff of the plant that Takahara had made into a crime scene were an unassuming bunch. For the most part they were either working class locals mixed with a few impoverished immigrants from throughout the sphere. They were paid meager wages and worked long hours, but showed no visible signs of resentment. Their employee reports were littered with pedantic and micro-managerial complaints and criticisms of their work ethic, but never of their attitude and disposition. The employee records also resolved an uncertainty that had been plaguing Detective Kodaira for some time. How had it been possible for Takahara to enter the plant and dump the body unnoticed? Did the plant not employ any guards, and if they did, how did he get past them?\n\nAs it would turn out, the plant did employ night guards, three to be precise. According to their records, the plant had started with just two and had recently hired the third about five months ago. They were paid slightly more than the floor workers and alternated night shifts between each other, according to the contract they all signed. They arrived each day at 7pm, when the last of the factory workers would be shutting and cleaning the plant, and left at 7am the next day, just as the next shift of workers was arriving.\n\nThe employee schedules revealed that the night guard who had been on duty the night of the murder was a man by the name of Hajime Katsuki. He was one of the older two guards, and had worked at the plant for nearly three years by that point. Upon hearing this, Kodaira pulled two members from the team and instructed them to interview Katsuki on his observations, and, if necessary, his alibi."
 japtouchou.15.a:0 "I'm sure it won't come to that."
 japtouchou.16.t:0 "Painting with Profit"
 japtouchou.16.d:0 "A careful analysis of the plant's financial records revealed a distinct dichotomy. The public, outward facing documents painted pictures of organized, systematic production, resulting in efficient and accurate budgets as well as generally accurate and positive growth potential. Indeed, it seemed that the plant had never gone a single quarter without reporting a net profit or some expansion of the plant. This had granted them a steady stream of private investors and seemingly unlimited credit. The internal facing documents, however, were an entirely different colour palette.\n\nThe plant's production methods were, in Kodaira's words, 'a perpetually spinning shitstorm of incompetence'. Every week the plant would receive a seemingly random amount of fish and other supplies, which they seemed to pay a random price for, rather than anything related to the size of the shipment. Those shipsment were taken of the trucks and processed by a completely inconsistent number of workers. A shift could have anywhere from less than ten people assigned to it, up to literally every single floor worker on the payroll. But despite this unintelligible mess of production, the profit projections and growth statistics seemed to always come extremely close to the actual net income.\n\nWhat was equally surprising however, was the sheer amount of money the plant had spent on contractors. And while the total sum of money paid to contractors was rather high, this was spread over only a few instances. Furthermore the details as to who the contractors were and what the contractors actually did were very sparse. More than once the only notes concerning the payments simply read 'contractor fees' with nothing to identify who did what and when. As the investigative team came to recognize this vagueness, they quickly moved to inquire after these contractors, to get a better understanding of the operations of the plant."

 japtouchou.17.t:0 "Caution and Consolidation"
 japtouchou.17.d:0 "Before long, the team under Kodaira had assembled a folder full of papers about Minezaka Koushou Kabushiki Gaisha dense enough to stop a small caliber bullet. Official forms, copies of inquiries, building permits, business cards, and even newspaper clippings spilled out the sides, revealing snippets and segments of detail to the world. While each individual piece of information was not strictly informative, the sheer totality of these semantic scraps suggested something in its own right. The conglomerate seemed to stretch so far and wide that a connection between it and the murder could have emerged from a dizzying number of possibilities.\n\nIt had been established in 1951, starting off as a simple shipping company primarily focused on transporting consumer products around the Sphere. But in the following years the company seemed to be graced with a surge of investment, and soon it expanded to encompass the wide range of industries it did today. Half a decade later, the conglomerate was awarded contracts by the Navy and other departments of the Imperial government, which conveniently coincided with Morihiro Soejima's appointment as chairman.\n\nBut something about the scale of the conglomerate nagged at the edges of Kodaira's mind. Unlike all the other colossal brands and corporate entities that straddled the Japanese economy, Minezaka seemed to slink and slide away from the public eye. Where the others proudly stamped their names and logos on every page within reach, every mention and mark related to the organization seemed to be cautiously placed by a hesitant hand. But a conglomerate does not express caution without reason, Kodaira had reasoned, and what other concern does a conglomerate have but profit? If a link was to be found, it would be there."

 japtouchou.18.d:0 "For an ostensibly public figure, Shinzo Soejima at times seemed as distant as the Emperor himself. And though his position on the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly was much lower rank than that, his grasp on his seat was just as firm. He had first come to occupy the predecessor to the prestigious legislative position shortly before the outbreak of the second war against the Chinese, when he was just thirty-six. Previously he had been a partner in a respected corporate law firm, but was swept into politics by the winds of change that had blown through Japan at the start of the century.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years of service, his name had not come to mean much to the general public of Tokyo, but within the halls and office's of the sprawling city his name carried some considerable weight. His reputation stemmed mostly from his performance on the major administration projects the city had undertaken over the years. He had been instrumental in the merger of the Tokyo City bureaucracies into the modern Tokyo Metropolitan Government that the country knew today. He was particularly involved with the design and implementation of the sub-governments of Tokyo's districts, including the maze of tax codes, zoning laws, regulations that accompanied them.\n\nOf course this all stood in stark contrast to his garish and grandiloquent son, Morihiro Soejima. It was a point of debate among the detective whether his attitude towards his only child was indicative of distant approval or silent contempt. They seemed to only appear together at the most important of state ceremonies, otherwise they lived diametrically opposed lives on what sometimes seemed to be entirely different planets. So what then, was this titan of administration's relation to this confused mess of a case? Was it merely circumstantial association by the actions of a fool hardy son, or something more?"

 japtouchou.19.d:0 "Kodaira scanned the letter Tachi had given him. It was printed on the same stiff and sturdy paper that all high ranking offices of the Empire used, and the seal of the Imperial Japanese Army was stamped in shimmering gold at the top. It did, however, lack any of the precision folds that often crossed their letters, suggesting it had been sent in a large envelope, likely with other files. Tachi, however had only felt the need to bring this one. Kodaira sat close to his desk, carefully studying each word while Tachi stood silently in front of him. Finally, he lowered the paper to his desk and looked up.\n\n'Awfully convenient, don't ya think?' Kodaira said.\n\n'To say the least.'\n\n'I mean, here we have a suspect, a confirmed murder mind you, who was actively deployed in the IJA. And under their supervision, he was given a crash course in explosives and then used his newfound skills in an attempt to cover his crime. And that attempt specifically involved the use of a military issue grenade. But despite all that, the Army can't seem to find anything to suggest their inventories are inaccurate or have been tampered with in even the slightest way, and they seem to have no interest in entertaining the possibility that Takahara gained access to restricted military material in another way. It seems to me that either the quality of Army records has dropped substantially since I last checked, or somebody is afraid of self-reflection.' Tachi nodded grimly in reply, brow furrowed. Kodaira looked back down at the letter, 'And you know, in my experience, letters like these are the paper equivalent of a door being slammed in your face.'\n\n'Which is why,' Tachi said, swiping the letter from the senior detective's desk, 'we are going to have to move fast if we want to get our foot in it.'"

 japtouchou.20.d:0 "Initially, the staff of the West Tokyo Behavior Clinic were reluctant to cooperate with the investigation. When the written and telephone messages received no proper reply in return, the team's assistant detective and two officers went to inquire after them personally. Even then, the staff were hesitant to provide any information, even outright questioning the legitimacy of the basis for our request. But, after the proper warrants were shown and some cautionary statements about obstruction of justice were given, they meekly stepped aside.\n\nUnlike the previous medical records, the files obtained from the clinic were mostly useless. Pages of speculation on the 'social origin' of Takahara's affliction alongside notes and results from various psychological and physical tests. In fact, the most critical file was the first one in the folder, which detailed the reason that had brought him to the clinic.\n\nAs the prior police report had hinted, Ryo Takahara had developed a drug addiction. An addiction which for almost the past year had been growing worse day by day, steadily consuming him. But what was most significant, which was eventually noticed by Detective Kodaira, was that Takahara was specifically addicted to amphetamines. Not only were these generally more expensive than most illegal drugs, the notes indicated that he had been taking particularly powerful, long lasting doses. The question was, how could an ostensibly impoverished soldier get addicted to such an expensive drug?\n\nFurthermore it begged the question as to how he was never reported to have any withdrawal symptoms, especially given the evidence to suggest he was an active member of the military. There was no indication that he substituted his usual amphetamines for 'soldier's drugs' like heroin. But surely, the team concluded, if there was more information to be had concerning Takahara's addiction, the Army would have it."

What few files that could be found related to Ryo Takahara's arrests contained few details and offered little insight. Worse still, none of them made any reference to his brother, Officer Takahara, or gave any evidence to suggest he had directly manipulated the proceedings of Ryo's arrests. With the paper trail beginning to falter, the investigation group under Detective Tachi turned to examine Officer Takahara's case records as a whole.\n\nIn doing so, the team collectively made four key observations. The first was that over the past year, Officer Takahara had responded to five separate calls to the specific fish processing plant where Shinji Yoshikage's body was found. Three times to remove trespassers from the premises, and two times to respond to reports of an attempted break in. On its own, this observation was not so suspicious. However, upon wider scrutiny, the second observation was made. Those five calls were the only calls for police made from the plant throughout the entire year. Still, it was not outside the realm of chance.\n\nThe third observation was a more general, mundane one. Officer Takahara's call record seemed to overwhelmingly consist of responses to suspected petty crime in industrial and seaside commercial zones. For the most part, the reports concerning these calls were extremely sparse. Usually they claimed that either Takahara took a statement and left, or that the situation was resolved without much consequence. The fourth, and final, observation was made by Detective Kodaira while he and Detective Tachi were consolidating their teams' work. The vast majority of the properties that Takahara responded to calls at were owned by one specific conglomerate, the Minezaka Koushou Kabushiki Gaisha.\n\nThe same conglomerate that owned the fish plant Yoshikage was found in."

More specifically, it took only two days for Kodaira's patience to run out, but the rest of the team convinced him to wait one more. They had tried repeatedly to get in contact with Katsuki using the information from the plant, but to no avail. In response, two of the team's officers went to the plant in person to enlist the help of management in arranging a meeting with him.\n\nBut when they arrived, they found that none of the managers were present. According to the receptionist, the on duty manager had stepped out for a meeting and had left the lower level supervisors collectively in charge. Not wanting to return to Kodaira empty, the officers asked to speak with a supervisor, intending to find when Katsuki's next shift was. But when they asked the supervisor, all they received was a puzzled look. Katsuki , according to him, was never going to have another shift, and he hadn't had one since over nine months ago, when he was fired.\n\nThe officers then elected to wait until the head manager returned, and when he did, they proceeded to push him against a wall and demanded to know 'exactly what kind of bullshit operation he was running'. But despite their heavy-handed approach, all the manager could stammer out were claims that it was the result of a paperwork error and an accident. He did, however, confirm that because of that error, the plant must have been unguarded on the night Takahara dumped the body.\n\nUpon hearing the officers' report, Kodaira ordered the team to find the most recent public files containing Katsuki's residence and to bring him in for questioning. He also emphasized that, given the delay and the convenient incompetence of the plant's management, he was not in the mood for non-cooperation and Katsuki could either 'open his door voluntarily on the spot, or wait a few hours for an Emergency Service Unit to kick it in.'"

Detective Kodaira and a small cohort of subordinates had gone to the plant in person under the general pretext of 'clarifying the context of some internal reports'. But this only lasted up until the door of the plant's meeting room swung closed, at which point Kodaira proceed to drill the panel of managers before him on the nature of the contractors and their shoddy filekeeping. But in the first moments of the detective's verbal assault, the looks on the managers' faces were not ones of fear or concern, but confusion. But these expressions did not remain long, and they quickly fired back with a series of stern statements.\n\nHowever, they could scarcely provide any more detail than was contained in the records themselves. They could provide only the vaguest sense as to what tasks they had performed, machine maintenance, employee evaluation, electrical repair, and so on, but they had little information concerning the particulars of the contractors themselves. Furthermore they could offer little to no details concerning the payment of said contractors, regardless of who they actually were. Per the testimony of the managers, the contractors were paid either in cash or by money order, with apparently little record preserved on their end. When pressed further, they became indignant, proclaiming that it was not their responsibility to maintain the financial records of contractors and their financial services.\n\nAt that point, Kodaira abruptly thanked them for their time and marched out of the plant, his posse following behind him. Outside he declared that they had 'wrung all they could from those sponges' and that it was time to move on. From a dented and worn payphone a few blocks from the plant, Kodaira instructed his team to turn their attention to finding the elusive contractors themselves."

Minezaka rested comfortably in the grey area between privately owned and publicly traded. The corporate leadership and industrial management positions were strictly controlled by the board overseen by Morihiro Soejima, who clearly maintained a highly curated list of potential appointees. But the financial aspect and investor pool seemed to be much more porous. According to a number of financial consultants, the Minezaka firm would allow investment from anyone with enough capital and reputation in exchange for dividends. This gave the conglomerate a reputation of stability and made it a fairly popular investment among members of Japan's political elite.\n\nBut the reputation the conglomerate had cultivated clashed with reality in a surprising way, it seemed to undersell the group's actual successes. Since its founding, not a single financial quarter had passed without Minezaka reporting positive growth. But the growth itself was jagged and irregular, punctuated by sudden, rapid bursts of industrial expansion followed by massive jumps in reported profit. Likewise, the conglomerate had never once delayed or reduced the dividends paid to its shareholders, in fact they seemed to increase fairly regularly.\n\nBut this source of shareholder glee also promoted suspicion on the part of the investigation. The expansions were unprecedented, there was hardly ever any suggestion or talk of preparations beforehand. Furthermore the expansions did not seem to correlate with increases in investment. On more than one occasion an already active expansion effort received an expansion of its own, all without any indication of further investment. It was obvious that Minezaka's pockets were deeper than even their most exuberant financial reports would let on, it was just a matter of what those pockets were actually filled with."

 japtouchou.25.d:0 "As it would turn out, even if you removed his son from the picture entirely, Shinzo Soejima had some latent connections to the Minezaka conglomerate. The first points of contact came through the old law firm he had been a partner of. In the spring of 1953 the firm came into contact with what was then the Minezaka Commercial Transport Corporation. They had been contracted to help set up and register the proposed Minezaka financial investment firm, the organization's first step towards its modern structure.\n\nThe investigation's efforts to locate and contact said firm revealed the second point of contact. A little over two years after closing the contract for setting up the financial firm, the rapidly expanding Minezaka conglomerate bought the firm outright, turning it into their own in-house legal team. Now had Minezaka bought out Soejima's stake in the law firm rather than grant him direct partial ownership, officially severing any direct tie between them. But the following years contained some trends that raised a few eyebrows when closely examined. The period between mid 1955 and early 1960 saw an explosion of growth within the newly christened conglomerate, rocking upwards through the ranks of Japanese finance.\n\nBut the size of the growth was not strictly the cause of suspicion, rather it was the speed. To open so many varied properties across so many wards would have required a nearly literal mountain paperwork to be processed by all the various divisions and subdivisions that Soejima had so meticulously designed. Yet given the rate at which properties were bought and registered, the approvals must have been sent out almost as soon as the requests came in. Furthermore the modern conglomerate's most prized contracts, those of the Imperial Government and Military, only materialized in late 1960, a few months after Minezaka quietly announced Morihiro Soejima as their new chairman. Perhaps Shinzo Soejima's association was merely coincidental, but it was an association none the less."

He made no move to pick up the envelope, but rather waited until his younger colleague voiced his frustrations, and then spoke himself.\n\n'The Army isn't known for being quick to share,' he said.\n\nTachi shook his head. 'This can't just be a matter of refusal to share. In fact, I'm sure if they had the ability to, they would happily blame Takahara's actions on drugs so they could get us to stay away. No, according to them, they have no record, medical or otherwise, to suggest that he suffered from any affliction at all, let alone amphetamine addiction.' Tachi shook his head. 'It just can't be the case. It would require such an extreme level of negligence to overlook a heavily withdrawn private that there's almost no way it could be unintentional. It's either that or...'\n\n'Or Takahara had access to a steady supply of rare, expensive drugs while deployed on a military base,' Kodaira interjected. 'Which would also require a pretty damn big crack in security to be possible.'\n\n'Yeah, exactly,' replied Tachi. 'So which is it?'\n\nKodaira rose from his seat, drained the last of his coffee, and firmly set the mug on top of the envelope on his desk. 'I'm not sure,' he said. 'But I know what comes next.'"

 japtouchou.27.d:0 "Since the onset of the investigation, the two internal teams had struggled solitarily. They pursued independent goals and filed independent reports, and only really saw each other in the dimly lit hallways and elevators of the central building of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The only proper contact was reserved for the two detectives who commanded their respective teams. But even they grew weary of the increasingly deviating leads, and began furiously search for any connection, no matter how small, that could provide them with the break they so desperately needed. Finally, they found it.\n\nThe link had not really been hidden, buried away beneath or within paperwork as the previous leads had, but it was not quite in the open either. It was a simple but all too common situation, in order to find it, you already had to know what it was, even if you don't realize it. And when they finally did, all the leads the investigation had been following began to slowly, but surely, turn back towards the link. Any other time, it was just another shooting, just another crime, and just another cop, but not this time.\n\nSeven months ago, outside a bar in the western side of Tokyo, a man by the name of Hajime Katsuki was shot dead by a police officer. Katsuki was formerly a night guard at the fish plant where Yoshikage's body was found, and he had been fired two months prior due to 'poor performance and disposition'. The officer that shot him was Keizo Takahara, the brother and co-conspirator of the murderer, Ryo Takahara. Officer Takahara also had responded to a call two months prior at the plant to remove Katsuki from the property when he protested his firing. These were the facts that could be firmly established by the investigation. However the claims that Katsuki produced the knife and attacked first, or that he had held serious grievances with the conduct of the plant, were yet to be confirmed."

 japtouchou.28.d:0 "The hope had been that delving into the details of the contractors hired by the plant would provide some insight into the operations of the plant and their incomprehensible record keeping. Kodaira had been particularly adamant about this point, claiming that the lackluster file keeping and business with the contractors 'visibly reeked with suspicion'. But every effort to pull the nature of the contractors into the clear light of day sent the team tumbling further and further into the fog of confusion.\n\nThe meager list of business names and contact details obtained from the plant and its staff was hardly more useful than if the detective had simply made up the names themselves. In total they only managed to make real contact with two of their intended targets. One was a freelance electrical technician, who could scarcely remember the plant at all, let alone any noteworthy details regarding its operation. The other was a machine shop specializing in hydraulics repair, who had been brought in to repair the plant's forklifts, and their neatly kept records and careful testimonies failed to reveal anything unusual.\n\nIn all other respects, the pursuit of the contractors amounted to nothing more than frustrations. Most could not be identified, much less traced to a specific location. The few that could be traced were either shuttered and dark or vague and unhelpful. Finally, only one potential source of information remained, the details surrounding the contract payments. Those that had been paid by money order could be tracked to a certain extent, but those who had been paid in cash required a more thorough approach. Warrants would need to be acquired not only for access to individual bank account records, but to the net transactional histories of the banks themselves. Once again, the investigation was pulled from the allure of the street work back into the cold embrace of Imperial bureaucracy."

 japtouchou.29.d:0 "Putting specific numbers to the profits of the Minezaka conglomerate was no easy feat. Despite the reckless and youthful imagine of the organization's chairman, the inner workings of the monolith were obviously constructed by the hands of skilled and experienced bureaucrats. The network linking the various trusts, firms, and factories was a meticulously built labyrinth of filing rules, tax codes, and special exemptions.\n\nEach subdivision of the conglomerate was addressed individually for the purposes of tax and account records, and usually this entailed contacting a different department of the tax agency each time. If a subdivision contained assets across multiple wards, requests had to be filed individually to each ward's tax division. Adding to this headache, the Bank of Japan refused to permit allow for general access to accounts related to the conglomerate for 'reasons pertaining to security', demanding individual requests for individual accounts.\n\nThe result was an endless process of acquiring and evaluating partial information. The detectives would receive snapshots and glimpses of money flowing through the channels and canals of the conglomerate, only to be lost again behind another stack of paper. Tax records would make reference to accounts the investigation lacked access to, which in turn was responsible for tax payments from an entirely different tax office. If there was any logic or reasons to the financial manipulations of Minezaka, it was buried beneath forests of paper and oceans of ink."

 japtouchou.30.d:0 "Kodaira's team had continued to compile information regarding Shinzo Soejima at the insistence of the detective himself. Ever since the details about Soejima's relationship with the Minezaka conglomerate had begun to come to light, he had fixated all his attention on the reserved councilman. In his view, the case was reducible to three points, the councilman, his son, and the plant owned by the conglomerate. Their job, according to Kodaira, was to draw the lines between them and find where they all intersect. So the team pored through the files they had collected, highlighting every overlap and relationship where they could be found, and speculating about their existence where they could not. Nothing taken for granted, nothing left to chance.\n\nAs it would happen, Kodaira's analysis was off by one point, placed dead in the center of the other three. One of the officers had been examining Councilman Soejima's recent political projects, when he found one detailing a recent restructuring effort in Tokyo's central tax office. He nearly passed over the document entirely, but suddenly a name appeared amidst the blocks of text, Shinji Yoshikage, the victim himself.\n\nHe had been chosen for a position in the Tokyo tax office department responsible for analysing and proposing changes to the city's tax code. His appointment came as a result of his years of prior service in the local tax offices and audit departments of various ward governments. There was no evidence to suggest Soejima had selected Yoshikage personally, but it was still his signature at the bottom of the page. That was enough for Kodaira to rally his team around his selected strategy and pursue it with renewed vigor."

On the other side of the polished plateau, the chief sat preeing at the report Kodaira had handed him shortly after they walked in the room. His wire frame glasses sat low on his nose as he carefully examined the work of his subordinates line by line. The office was still, the silence only interrupted by the occasional rustling of paper as the chief turned the page. Finally, the chief detective brought his gaze from the papers on his desk and up to meet the eyes of the two men before him.\n\n'You're certain?' he asked. Tachi opened his mouth to reply but Kodaira beat him to it.\n\n'Absolutely, sir,' he said, firmly. 'The evidence we have compiled based on the profile of Takahara simply cannot be dismissed as circumstantial. Every indication suggests that Takahara's motivations were either facilitated by some personnel from the Army, or made feasible by some failure within its systems. Regardless, the generally poor cooperation show by the IRA-GS, combined with the almost pathologically insufficient maintenance of records, should provide more than enough grounds to justify a re-orientation of the investigation towards military administration.' As he finished, the chief flicked his hard gaze over towards Tachi.\n\n'And you?' the chief said.\n\n'Couldn't have said it better myself, sir,' Tachi replied quickly.\n\n'Well then,' said the chief, sliding the report back into its folder, 'get to it.'"

 japtouchou.32.d:0 "Kodaira and Tachi again found themselves under the awning at the front of the police station. This time, the smoke from their cigarettes flowed upwards past the awning until it disappeared into the gloom of the night sky. A small archipelago of crushed cigarette butts sat on the ground before Kodaira, while only a single one lay next to Tachi's shoes, a tiny burst of yellow amidst the dark pavement. But a stillness hovered between them, punctuated by the occasional soft sigh of an inhale and the crackling of burning tobacco. To the unfamiliar eye, they appeared to be strangers, joined together only by the circumstances of habit.\n\n'You know, some small part of me had hoped we would never get here,' said Tachi, solemnly. Kodaira was silent in reply. 'I mean, nobody wants to dig through the department for this case, it's almost like rooting through your own laundry looking for evidence,' Tachi continued. 'Everyone loves a conspiracy until one lands right in your lap.'\n\nIn one motion Kodaira dropped the end of his current cigarette and reached into his coat pocket to pull out the rest of the box. While his partner struck his lighter and brought it up to his face, Tachi continued. 'It's just that, following a case is one thing, it's like walking along a path where you need to keep any eye out for the right sign posts. But this, this is like leaning over a pit that you can't see the bottom of.' He started off towards the night sky, 'Just why did it have to be us?'\n\n'The fact that it happened to us is pure chance,' said Kodaira, releasing a cloud of smoke, 'But the fact that it happened at all isn't. Truth be told, I think this has been a long time coming.'"

 japtouchou.33.d:0 "Kodaira and Tachi sat on opposite sides of an unclaimed desk, each with an avenue of spreadsheets and forms laid out before them, lined with stacks of folders and binders. At times they were strictly parallel and at other they cross, intersected, or overlapped. Sometimes they led right up to the edge of an accompanying critical folder, and other times they trailed off to dead ends. Every now and again the crisp black and white surfaces were adorned with the sharp blue ink that comprised Tachi's neatly drawn characters or tagged with the rough graphite that formed Kodaira's hasty scribbles.\n\nIf one followed the two men on their visual strolls along the paper routes, they would be met with an incomprehensible mass of digits. They were arranged into integers, fractions, and decimals, sometimes joined by text and other times left to speak for themselves. They were presented in lists, squared into tables, and stamped beneath all sorts of graphs, charts, and diagrams. At certain points they seemed to converge, following a steady tread or a smooth curve, only then to violently diverge again, scattering data points across the pages like stars in the night sky. Rather than a concrete, logical narrative, the numbers spelled out schizophrenic rantings and ravings of new directions and failed ventures,of unspeakable highs and unthinkable lows. It spun on and on, circles within circles, tangents leading to tangents, all the while drawing closer and closer towards the orbit of an inescapably dense point of confusion and misdirection, until finally...\n\nKodaira tossed his pencil across the surface of the desk. 'Okay, fuck this,' he said as Tachi looked up at him. 'Time for a new plan.'"

 japtouchou.34.d:0 "Tachi frowned at the display of highlighted and annotated papers, handwritten notes, and scattered notes assembled on the desk before him. He had carefully listened while Kodaira weaved together the narrative he claimed was contained within the formidable mass of text. Through his whole presentation he had gestured to particularly significant fragments of information, sometimes placing a finger by the key characters and other times handing an entire page to Tachi for closer inspection. He had carefully balanced each piece of information on top of another, supported assumptions with pillars of facts, and bridged logical chasms with carefully constructed hypotheses. Finally, upon reaching the crux of the argument, he had turned to gauge the reaction of his fellow detective.\n\n'I see what you are pointing out,' said Tachi, carefully weighing each word. 'But doesn't it all just seem a bit loose?' Kodaira shook his head in reply.\n\n'That's just it,' he said, 'This kind of case is designed to be loose. In order to crack this thing open, we can't just assume everything will line up one-to-one, we have to figure out they start to overlap. That's the point of what we're doing, the parallel approach. It all starts out straight and seperate, but eventually it all turns back towards each other. Between what you've been doing and what I've been doing, this is the only point at which its really started to turn in a way that gives us a real direction. Can we really afford to let slip away?'\n\nTachi frowned again."

 japtouchou.35.d:0 "The investigation as a whole had grown thoroughly tired of their mostly one-sided conversations with the Army. The process of contacting the correct office, requesting the correct form, and gleaning a reply had more in common with pulling teeth than pulling records. Given most of the division were trained in deskwork and not dentistry, their collective patience for the process evaporated quickly. As a result, the two lead detectives, Kodaira and Tachi, conspired with the chief to come up with a strategy to break the bureaucratic gridlock.\n\nTachi proposed a direct route. He maintained that the Army could not waver or slink away from such serious administrative failings if they were brought out into the light. Escalating the issue to the higher echelons of Army command would force a response out of necessity, they would tolerate such conduct even less than the investigation could. What they needed to demand, Tachi maintained, was accountability.\n\nKodaria, on the other hand, pushed for an indirect, roundabout approach. He argued that they would never get what they needed from the Army by operating under the impression that they were on even ground, because they clearly were not. Instead they should go around the Army, in a sense. Direct the correct agency or organization towards the existing evidence of mismanagement, and the secrets would come spilling out of their own accord. As each made their case, the chief deliberated over the two positions carefully, before halting the debate with his decision."

 japtouchou.36.d:0 "Nobody involved with the investigation could deny that the presence of Officer Takahara as a participant in the case had an noticeable effect on the staff at large. This was obvious from the demeanor of the officers and the precautions they took, but what was even more telling was what they did not say. None had dared to explicitly, publically suggest that some element of the Police Force itself was involved with the Takahara's crime in some way, as if doing so would send the investigation spiraling to its doom. So prevalent was this attitude that even when Tachi and Kodaira broke this trend, they did so behind firmly closed doors.\n\nIn their view, the overlap revealed by the combination of their efforts was too significant to simply dismiss as chance. Even if the department had not directly aided in carrying out the murder, they almost certainly had facilitated it in some way. What had to be determined was who could have aided Takahara, and why they did so. Presumably it was possible that the help was given unintentionally, but it was just as likely that it was given opportunistically or, even worse, by the willful manipulations of an associated party. The issue that remained was deciding on the best means to investigate this, while keeping their suspicions hidden.\n\nTo that end, Tachi had proposed attempting to identify co-conspirators by reviewing the officers and staff that had worked with Officer Takahara during the relevant timeframes. Any inconsistencies could be easily revealed by comparing the various statements. Kodaria sympathized with that strategy, but also proposed an alternate method he believed to be more subtle. Finding and following the movement of the Takahara's payment from its source to its destination could reveal more subtle acts of collaboration, maybe even at the higher levels of the Police."

 japtouchou.37.d:0 "Two things had become clear to the investigation as they fought their way through the confused finances of the plant and the Minezaka conglomerate that towered over it. First, regardless if the plant and its owners were directly involved with the murder, the internal accounts and monetary reports were far too inconsistent to be dismissed as incidental. Second, those inconsistencies were so prevalent that it was nearly inconceivable that these files had made their way through the major public financial institutions and regulatory bodies legitimately. In order to get a full, clear picture of the incomprehensible network of capital that surrounded the case, the investigation's two lead detective concluded that they would need to get a bird's eye view.\n\nThere were two good places to start, each presiding over a different aspect of domestic Japanese finance and a cornerstone of Imperial bureaucracy. One was the Bank of Japan and the regulatory bodies that surrounded it. The Bank was a central organ in all sectors of the economy, acting as both the reservoirs and canals for the torrents of money that flowed through Japan and her allies. The Minezaka conglomerate and the subordinate plant were no exception, as they had a great number of associated accounts with the Bank. Full access to their records would allow for a more complete understanding of the profits and expenses over a long period, rather than at just single moments in time.\n\nThe other option was the ever-feared and universally loathed Tokyo Tax Bureau. Even among the various attack dogs of the Ministry of Finance, they were known to be particularly vicious. It was difficult to imagine that bureaucrats of such legendary ferocity would allow such flargent mismanagement to go unnoticed without some form of illegal persuasion or heavy handed manipulation.

He was ceaselessly diligent and personally invested in the outcome of his projects. A member of that rare breed who sees the analysis and manipulations of numbers and values as an art form in its own right. It was little wonder then, that he had been assigned such a critical position in the project to restructure the city's tax codes.\n\nThough his post was of central importance, he had been regarded as a loner. Most days he arrived early in the morning before everyone else in the department had arrived and remained in his office until well after most had left. The only real interactions people could recall were hurried, but polite greetings in hallways, and the endless series of requests for additional documents he made to the lower level staff.\n\nThere was no indication that this degree of isolation was the result of some grievance he held against his peers or vice versa. But even so, there seemed to be a strangely large distance between him and the general office systems. Hardly anyone could give a more detailed description of his actual day to day work beyond 'statistical analysis' and vague references to the overall goals of the project. This was even the case among the other tax code restructuring project members and supervisors, implying that nobody had yet picked up where Yoshikage had left off. The investigation was faced with an important consideration, was this separate due to some property of the wider Tax Bureau, or was it something about the victim's work itself?"

His chosen target and recipient of the investigation's ire was the Administration Bureau of the Army Ministry, the Imperial Army's source of representation in the Imperial Cabinet. Every request and form was subject to his scrutiny before being sent, and every official letter and written communication was born at least in part from his pen.\n\nThrough his efforts, Tachi wove an accuestory narrative aimed directly at the Ministry and their underlings. He alleged that the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office had allowed a culture of inadequate record handling to take root. Not only in the departments with which the case was explicitly concerned, but the Office's general correspondence with outside parties as a whole. He warned that not only was this a strong indictment of the General Staff's conduct, but it also reflect poorly on them as well, as they were charged with the administrative aspects of Army's function. Failure to act on or resolve this matter, would only worsen that reflection.\n\nFor their part, the Ministry did seems to take almost immediate notice of Tachi's handiwork. Just days after the first wave of correspondence, a sealed envelope addressed from the Army Ministry Tokyo Headquarters arrived at the station. Inside was a neatly typed and folded letter addressed to the Chief of the department. They graciously thanked the investigation for bringing the issue to their attention and assured them they would investigate the situation with 'utmost haste'."

The goal was to locate and coordinate with an organization that was legally and functionally separate from the Army bureaucracy, but still carried enough authority to force it into compliance. This proved to be difficult due to strength of the Army's representation in the Imperial Government. Their political presence was commanded by the Army Ministry, which represented them on the Imperial Cabinet, while their operations and conduct were governed by the IJA General Staff Office.There was only one office, according to Kodaira, that could possibly face this challenge and have even a minuscule chance of success, the Imperial Board of Audit.\n\nThe Board existed in a strange space within Japanese administration. Ostensibly independent of both the National Diet and various Ministries of state, the Imperial Auditors were directly subordinate to only the Emperor himself. On paper, this portrayed the Board as being above all in a certain sense, a manifestation of the divine will of the Emperor, endowed with the responsibility to ensure the loyalty of offices of the Empire. In practice however, the Emperor had little interest in managing the glorified accountants, and so the Board had fallen under the de-facto collective authority of the Cabinet.\n\nThis had left the Board in a sorry state, perpetually ignored or forgotten save for the occasional politicized busywork. So the investigation's plea for assistance was received as a welcome change of pace. Indeed, even though they were only provided only the vaguest details of why the help was needed and what the objective was, the Board's representatives were eager to carry out their original charge, doubly so when they learned the objects of scrutiny were within the Cabinet itself."

The focused primarily one other street officers, but also expanded their search to include supervisors, detectives, and dispatchers who had worked alongside him. Once assembled, the team slowly worked their way down the list, conducting interviews and collecting statements regarding Takahara's conduct and their impressions of him.\n\nMost gave the same rough characterization of him regardless of their respective relationship relationship. He was seen as reserved, but not reclusive or lonesome. He was perfectly capable of, and willing to partake in casual conversation, and was mostly polite and slow the outright anger. Those who had worked with him directly described a diligent, but not fanatical, worker, who carried out his tasks with the unconscious efficiency of routine. Those who were slightly more removed hardly had any perceptions of him at all, positive or negative, he was simply another rank-and-file officer.\n\nBut there was one dispatcher who did not know him at all. This would have been unremarkable, had the dispatcher not been the one who was recorded to have sent Takahara to the bar where he shot the plant's nightguard. Not only that, he claimed to have no memory of such an event at all, vehemently denying that he remembered any details of the case or filing the incident report. Kodaria took this as suspicious, but Tachi was unsure, a flat denial seemed an odd move for a conspirator. Could it be possible that the incident reports were wrong?"

 japtouchou.42.d:0 "It was undeniable that Officer Takahara had undertaken a great personal risk with his decision to aid his brother in the aftermath of the crime. If he was truly involved in some wider plot, there must have been a near infinite number of occasions when one of his peers or supervisors could have uncovered his complicancy. With such tremendous consequences an ever present threat, what was he getting in exchange? The detectives found it unlikely that he acted out of anything resembling brotherly love, given his apparent pattern of indifference towards his sibling's well-being. Instead they looked to the universal motivator, the all powerful Yen.\n\nPawing their way through the personal files of the treacherous officer and the records held by the salary department, the team compiled a rough financial profile for Takahara. Using the records of the paychecks issued by the Police, they calculated his estimated net worth after accounting for taxes and tracked the checks to the Bank of Japan account where they were cashed. While they submitted the warrants for the account files to the Bank, members of the unit searched through Takahara's locker and personal effects, looking for signs of superfluous wealth. But they could find nothing more than the standard equipment and personal items one could expect of a Tokyo police officer. If the officer had indeed been receiving consistent payments for his nefarious actions, he kept such evidence hidden away, like the memories of a shameful deed.\n\nOld money whispers, New money shouts."

They were courteous, attentive, and prompt in their actions and replies. Whether this behavior was due to a sense of duty or a fear of reprisal was irrelevant, the detective and desk workers of the investigation we just glad to have a break from the constant bureaucratic battles of the past few weeks.\n\nUnfortunately however, the new perspective provided by the Bank's files was not as clear as the detectives had hoped. The plant, along with most of its siblings beneath the Minezaka parent organization, worked heavily with cash. Constant money orders and long lists of liquid deposits and withdrawals filled folder after folder. Some were easily traceable, sent to other Bank of Japan accounts or otherwise given some description. Others were more difficult, with seemingly arbitrary amounts of money being withdrawn or deposited at random times. Due to the length of the records, the investigation was forced to focus their attention on the timeframe surrounding the murder, and slowly work their way outward.\n\nWithin that range, the team found one particularly suspect transaction. A little over a week before the body was found, 5000 Yen were withdrawn from one of the central industrial reserve accounts owned by the conglomerate. Beyond being much smaller than the rest of the withdrawals, there was absolutely no contextual information alongside it. No intended recipient, no specified denomination, no explanatory notes, and no issued receipt. Without any identifying information, the investigation was forced to turn to the tedious process of track the serial numbers of the issued notes to try and locate their destination."

 japtouchou.44.d:0 "Though the filing and payment of taxes was regarded by many as one of the few constants in life, the office that oversaw those processes for so many in Japan seemed to be in a perpetual state of turmoil. The investigation's first step in the review of the Tokyo Tax Bureau was to collect the names of the those who occupied the various posts in the upper levels of the organization's hierarchy, in order to be prepared for when the detectives would inevitably have to reach out to them. But it quickly became clear that based on the previous few years, that information could change at any time.\n\nThe staff files and public statements put out by the Bureau showed their leaderships to be in a constant state of flux. Managers who had only held their post for a few months were dismissed and replaced with little reason or fanfare. Staff working in one division would be suddenly transfer to another completely unrelated division. Sometimes supervisors from the local ward offices would be brought up to the central office, only to be pushed back down again some time later. Even the department heads of the Bureau were not safe from the perpetual reshuffling. At any time they could be demoted, transferred, or replaced by a handpicked candidate by the Metropolitan Government.\n\nIt was not apparent to the investigation as to why the Bureau functioned in this manner, and indeed many questioned how the office could function at all in this state. There were no reports of serious grievances or systemic troubles, so why then was there such high turnover? And how could such a critical institution continue to operate while being constantly interrupted?"

 japtouchou.45.d:0 "With the help of some report summaries provided by the managers at the Tokyo Tax Bureau, the investigation was able to gain a bit more insight into the actual work that Yoshikage had been doing before he was murdered. While the project as a whole had been focused on the structure of layout of the tax code as a whole, Yoshikage had been focused specifically on the industrial-commercial side. Within that realm, he seemed to have be focused on two particular aspects.\n\nThe first was an effort to improve the accuracy of tax payment estimations for industrial production facilities in order to cut down on the number of over- and underpayments that had to be corrected after the fact. This had involved leafing through the records of the largest industrial producers, as well as examining current production and profit rates from cooperating companies, in order to develop a more accurate estimation system. Beyond this, he had begun to develop a proposal for a system of quarterly reviews for the largest industrial companies to improve market estimations, but it seemed that little progress was made before his death.\n\nThe second effort was an attempt to streamline and integrate the auditing and tax review processes between the ward offices and central office. From the reports, Yoshikage had begun to develop a radical new system whereby the individual offices would have their authority more closely tied to that of the central office with a more consistent information stream. Furthermore it would eliminate the ward responsibilities for some zoned areas entirely, placing them directly under the central Bureau instead. However it seemed that even less progress had been made on this proposal, with Yoshikage himself noting that progress had been delayed by the performance of the Tax Bureau's Audit Division."

It arrived in the same manner that the first had, sealed envelope, neatly folded pages, and sharp ink characters. But the message this one contained was very different from the agreeable tone of the first. So much so that Kodaira characterized it as 'the nicest possible way to tell someone to fuck off and die'.\n\nThe Ministry's reply, after forcing its way through the obligatory pleasantries, first took the opportunity to clear themselves of any wrongdoing and write off any suggestions otherwise as hearsay. They maintained that the administrative mishaps the investigation had experienced were side effects of previous logistical restructurings and changes in responsibility between the Ministry and General Staff Office. These processes had resulting in some 'known insufficiencies' in the records system which had already been identified and accounted for. As for the frustrating rate of turnaround displayed by the various Army offices, the Ministry thoroughly expressed the importance of redundancy for the sake of security, and that such performance fell well within acceptable standards.\n\nNaturally the Ministry's calm rebuttal sent the investigative team into a frenzy of activity. The lead detectives had no intention of taking the Ministry at their word and resolved to take further action. It was clear that looking the Army Ministry in the face was not a viable option, but where to turn to next? Back down to the General Staff, or even higher up?"

 japtouchou.47.d:0 "Unfortunately, not everyone was so excited to see the Board of Audit's functional role restored. In order to avoid alerting any potential conspirators or implicating the investigation, the Board had resolved to act alone publically while coordinating and corresponding privately with the investigation. Even though their position within the Imperial hierarchy was a point of unrecognized contention, they maintained that their role was fundamentally proactive, They were not intended to simply wait around until whispers of corruption reached the ears of the Emperor himself, they claimed. Rather, any time an issue or inconsistency within the government was brought before them, they were bound by duty and honor to see it resolved.\n\nHowever the various members and Ministries that comprised the Cabinet were unmoved by the Board's lofty claims. It was the Cabinet's view that while the Board was independent of every individual Ministry, they were not independent of all the Ministries taken together. If they allowed for unprompted audits with undisclosed motives and orders, they risked allowing 'the poison of factionalism' back into the Imperial government. How could the Cabinet be sure the audit was not intended to meet some opportunistic political goal? All the Ministries of the Cabinet said some form of this argument, save for the Army Ministry, who essentially screamed it when they found out their files in particular were in question.\n\nSeeing this, the joint Board-investigation team took stock and tried to formulate a new approach. They found that there were two possible directions. Either they could try to avoid the Cabinet entirely by reaching out to the highest possible levels of Japanese administration, or they could appeal to the division that represented the Police in the turmoil of Imperial politics, the Bureau of Public Order."

Based on the available files and testimonies of other dispatchers and supervisors, the dispatcher was on duty during the time period when the shooting occured. As for the event itself, most claimed to have some general knowledge or awareness of it, but few could recall any specific details or observations from the day. Notably however, none could remember any instance of the dispatcher making reference to the event either.\n\nGrowing increasingly worried, the lead detectives confront the head of the records division, hoping to gather some information concerning the related files themselves. But the department head was just as mystified as the rest of his staff, if not more. He was barely able to say anything about the shooting at all and provided virtually no details concerning the creation and storage of the files. At first the detectives grew annoyed and suspicious, but when they pressed him on the integrity of the files and the potential for unauthorized modification, the reason for his demeanor became clear.\n\nThe department head had occupied his position for less than six months in total. His predecessor was an aging veteran of the Tokyo Police, who had held the post for the better part of the prior decade. But just a month after the shooting, he unexpectedly resigned, leaving the department scrambling to find a replacement. His reason for doing so was because of a promotion, but in reality it was less of a promotion and more of a job offer. Because his new position took him above the police force entirely, up to their source of representation in the Imperial Cabinet, the Bureau of Public Order."

 japtouchou.49.d:0 "What the records of Takahara's bank account revealed were not obvious to the naked eye. At a glance, it a appeared to be little more than the ebb and flow of money typical of any bank account. But the investigation was not simply glancing. Comparing the pattern of outbound payments to the average demographics of the area where Takahara's listed residence was, the investigation calculated an estimated rent, cost of living, and utility expenses. With these estimations, they compared the actual rate of withdrawal and deposits as well as the changing total balance of the account. What they found, was that the numbers didn't quite add up, not by an obscene amount, but enough to raise any accountant's eyebrows.\n\nThere were a number of points where the balance simply should not have been what it actually was. Oftentimes these coincided with what were determined to be significant payments, such as security deposits, doctor's services, and more recently, mortgage payments. In these cases, the total balance should have been lower than the records indicated after the payment. Some of these instances came from obvious sources, where a large cash deposit was made several days prior to a large payment. Some speculated that this was evidence of Takahara slowly siphoning in dark money from a physical source, using it to offset major expenses while maintaining his standard of living. A level of discretion and control that most fraud culprits did not show.\n\nFrom that point, the next step was to test that theory by attempting to locate Takahara's cache, if such a thing truly existed. Kodaira suggested the classic approach, tear their way through his place of residence and count the 'loose change' they come across. Tachi opted for a more restrained approach. The cash deposits made to the bank presumably had serial numbers, as did all official Yen banknotes, so they could simply trace the record of the notes themselves and follow it back to the source."

 japtouchou.50.d:0 "After the painstaking process of recording the serial numbers of the notes issued by the bank for the withdrawal in question, the investigation submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance. Though serial number tracking could be a very effective means of identifying fraud, acquiring the relevant, complete records was a slow procedure, littered with difficulties and chances for error. Each note would have to be traced to the file group associated with its issue date, where the chronological list of registered locations could be found.\n\nHowever, the only occasions when the notes would consistently be registered and appear on the list is when they were deposited or withdrawn from a bank account. So if the notes were being held as a cash reserve their location would likely not appear. Even worse, due to the sheer number of transactions taking place on a daily basis in Japan, there was usually a sizeable delay between the initial recording and that recording's appearance on the list. Then, of course, there was the obvious problem, the cash was likely spent at different places, at different times, and ended in different destinations.\n\nThat is why it was such a shock when the records finally arrived in the hands of the investigation and revealed that all the notes that had be issued for the withdrawal were currently together in one place. They had been deposited in the bank account of one of the regional financial offices of the government of Manchuria. How they got there, was another question entirely."

 japtouchou.51.d:0 "As it would happen, the high rate of turnover in the Tokyo Tax Bureau was not quite evenly distributed. While all the departments experienced it to some degree, none more so than the Audit Division. This was the group responsible for reviewing the tax forms and returns of major institutions and those with suspect records. Ostensibly they were involved with investigating everything from estate tax payments to currency exchange programs. But unlike the other departments, instead of a constant stream of departures and new arrivals, the auditors seemed to only be faced with departures. Hardly anyone was moved from another department into the Audit Division, and anytime someone was removed from the division they were almost always destined to be send back down to the local ward offices. Over the years the total number of staff had dwindled down to a skeleton crew.\n\nMany in the investigation team questioned how the office could perform its varied and intensive functions with so few resources. But the answer turned out to be painfully simple, they weren't. Hardly anything came out of the division other than the occasional allegations of minor fraud or tax evasion, and even these had grown few and far between. Even projects that one would think would require the input of the auditors showed no sign of their involvement.\n\nOfficially, the reason for the division's decline was the 'increasing redundancy of the department as a whole and the continual dispersion of its functions to more appropriate bodies'. This line came from an internal review obtained by the investigation, and coincided with a substantial budget slash. But what functions were they referring to? And if the auditors were not involved, who was?"

 japtouchou.52.d:0 "Unsatisfied with the vague outlines and broad descriptions provided in the project reports by the staff at the Tokyo Tax Bureau, the investigation team pressed for more. Kodaira in particular stressed the importance that the actual figures in the statistics Yoshikage had collected held to the case. Furthermore it was essential that they know the context of the statistics, who the data was collected from and pertained to. If Yoshikage had noted some inconsistencies in the numbers, the implications they provide may prove key to assigning a motivation for the murder.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bureau was not so keen to share their deceased worker's efforts, regardless of the justification. They claimed that the project details and its internal files were considered 'secure', due to the fact that the effort was still ongoing. They could not allow the yet unfinished proposals and analytics to become a matter of public record out of a concern that the relevant and related parties would take pre-emptive measures to subvert their conclusion. Kodaira, of course, harshly rejected this claim, proclaiming that there was a chance that a related party had already taken pre-emptive measures in the form of murdering their coworker.\n\nBut this did little to sway the tight-lipped taxmen, who maintain that they were bound by both internal regulations and external expectations. However one supervisor was surprisingly candid, saying that even if he believed there was good cause to give the investigation access, such an act would require authorization from external authorities. To Tachi, this was a red flag on its own, in his view the transparency of the organization had been critically compromised, but Kodaira was insistent on keeping up the pressure."

The hastily assembled plan had been sketched out and put into motion less than a day after they received the Ministry's response. The intention had been to make quiet contact with officials throughout the Operations, Intelligence, and Communications divisions of the IJA General Staff Office. Once the contacts were made, the investigation would attempt to get ahold of files related to the internal operations of the records rather than the records themselves, alongside testimonies from said officials. Once collected, that information could be complied and compared to the statements made by the Ministry to reveal any sources of inconsistency.\n\nHowever it quickly became apparent that the investigation's mistrust of the Army Ministry was mutual. Almost all the contacted officials either requested clearance the team did not have or simply deferred to the Ministry outright. Of the few who did speak, they all either could not offer anything of use or could merely point to an uncooperative superior. The Army's bureaucracy all at once appeared to be water-tight, sealed in word, thought, and deed.\n\nBut even in the face of this decisive setback, the pair of lead detectives remained firm. The argued, both privately to the Chief and to the team as a whole, that now was the time to double down on the strategy. Clearly, they claimed, the Army was worried about what the investigation would find buried beneath all the papers. So worried, in fact, that they had rushed to clamp down on any potential points of entry. And where there was worry and frantic action, there were bound to be mistakes."

 japtouchou.54.d:0 "Overwhelmed by the politics of the Cabinet, there was only one body left that the investigation could look up to for assistance, and this one required them to look so high they risked spraining their necks. It was a poorly kept secret that in the lead up to the first war with the Chinese back in 1894, the bickering between the Imperial Army and Navy became so intense it threatened to tear apart the war effort before it even began. To resolve this, then Emperor Meiji ordered the creation of the Imperial General Headquarters, an organization intended to coordinate and resolve disputes between the branches. With the Emperor himself as its head, this was the only body with legal administrative authority over the two juggernauts that comprised the military forces of the Empire.\n\nSo it was even more of a shock when the Headquarters responded to the investigation's appeals with instructions to consult the Army Ministry for processing such requests. At first most believed that the staff were simply playing the same game of delaying and deflecting that the offices of the Army had, but further correspondence proved otherwise. Their role, the Headquarters claimed, was purely mediatory and coordinative, not administrative. It was neither their responsibility to manage the branches' interactions with external offices nor was it prerogative to override their decisions in that respect.Defeated, the investigative team and their lead detectives were forced to return to the drawing board. It was clear there was no viable route by which they could access and examine the inner workings of the Army. Whether this was due to complacency or pure stubbornness was irrelevant. In either case, more proactive means of investigation were now required."

 japtouchou.55.t:0 "The Advocates"
 japtouchou.55.d:0 "Finding themselves caught in the tangled web of Imperial politics that surrounded Japan's public institutions, the investigation now turned towards their own representatives, the Bureau of Public Order. The Bureau was part of the Home Ministry, one of the most powerful non-military Ministries of state, with broad authority ranging from urban planning to colonial affairs. The Bureau itself served as the central hub for civilian police administration. Over the course of its existence the Bureau had slowly acquired more responsibilities beyond those of public protection, including fire prevention and mediation of public disputes.\n\nDue to the sheer scale of its charge, in recent years the Bureau had retreated from the day to day management of the individual police departments, allowing a degree of unofficial autonomy to form, so long as the departments still vocally adhered to its strict guidelines. Furthermore, as the Kenpeitai and other military police agencies steadily began to encroach further and further into civil jurisdiction, the Bureau became intensely fixated on preserving their position within the political hierarchy, lest they one day find themselves beneath the bootheels of military bureaucracy. According to the grumblings of many former and veteran officers, the Bureau was more concerned with acting as 'the Cabinet's favorite dog' than the keepers of public order.\n\nIn that vein, the investigation hoped that the severity and subversive nature of the case would galvanize the Bureau back into their original role. With their voices joined to those of the investigation, they might just be able to command enough authority to force open the administrative doors that had prevented the case from progressing."

 japtouchou.56.d:0 "In the end, Kodaira got what he wanted, a good old fashioned search raid. Leading the team of officers, detectives, and forensic specialists personally, the veteran detective arrived at Officer's Takahara house with a slight spring in his step. Once through the front door, the group of proud public servants proceeded to ransack their way through the neatly organized home, pulling up everything that wasn't nailed down and a few things that were. Thankfully, no major unnecessary damage was caused that would require reimbursement, as the report made clear that the two holes in the wall had been there when the police arrived, and that the office door had been manually barred, and thus the use of the battering ram was perfectly justified.\n\nFinally, after a few hours of frenzied searching, the team unearthed their prize. An officer, after moving a bedside table in the master bedroom, noticed one of the floorboards stuck up slightly. With the aid of a forceful pull, the polished piece of wood popped free from the floor, revealing a dark, hollow space beneath. Hesitantly, the officer reached into the hole, leaning forward until his hand brushed against something in the dark. After he grabbed ahold of it and pulled it out into the light, he shouted urgently for his peers.\n\nFifteen minutes and a few floorboards later, the whole hoard was exposed to the world. Thousands upon thousands of Yen, bound with rubber bands, stuffed into bags and boxes, all safely tucked away in the space beneath the floor. From the amount alone it was obvious that this was no emergency fund, this was money that was intended to stay in the dark. But what was most surprising was that not all of it was in the crisp bills issued by the Ministry of Finance. About half of the stash took the crude form of the infamous Japanese Military Yen."

 japtouchou.57.d:0 "Following the crumb-trail of digits stamped on the suspect Yen notes took the investigation further from Tokyo than they had anticipated. All the serial numbers pointed across the choppy sea and into one of the oldest Japanese conquests, Manchuria. Specifically, all the notes seemed to circle around the accounts of the Sphere member's local financial institutions. Confusion as to how and why the money had ended up there was only worsened by closer scrutiny. Those particular accounts were involved in a shadow practice dating back to the earliest months of the Japanese invasions during the war, the exchange of the controversial Japanese Military Yen.\n\nThe military Yen, sometimes referred to in hushed tones as 'invasion currency', was the predominant currency issued to non-government citizens of other Sphere countries and areas under the direct administration of the Japanese Armed Forces. While its value was not pegged against any real standard, it could be exchanged for civil Yen. But this process of exchange was strictly controlled and the rates were never consistent, often an intentional result of bureaucratic manipulations.\n\nIndeed, that was the claim given by the Manchurian financial representatives when first contacted by the investigation. The transactions they had associated with the government accounts were involved with buyback and 'liquidity balancing' programs aimed at maintaining a steady rate of growth and curbing local inflation. However they would offer no more information than that, claiming dispensing individual transaction information was beyond the scope of their authority. For that, the investigation would have to turn to the relevant offices embedded in the Japanese military."

 japtouchou.58.d:0 "Finally, the reason for the Tokyo Tax Bureau's reluctance to share specific information about the tax code project came into the light. As some had implied, the Bureau's policy of relative silence was less due to a refusal to open its mouth, and more due to a bootheel pressed firmly on its throat. While reviewing the earliest project reports, the detectives came across a section detailing the process of analyzing and proposing regulations for the movement of capital and assets between Sphere countries. The section was noteworthy for two reasons. One, Shinji Yoshikage was designated as the chief analyst of this part of the project, and two, supervision of this particular part was placed under the administration of the Army Ministry, with them having primary authorization rights and access to the internal project files on request.\n\nInitially, this seemed like an utterly bizarre and arbitrary decision, what did the army have to do with tax reform? But with some more goading, their true role began to take shape. Much of the data involved with that part of the project included information regarding the systems and usage of the Japanese Military Yen, the currency stand-in common among the soldiers and civilians of peripheral Sphere nations. As it would turn out, the distribution and handling of the Military Yen had been almost entirely administered by the offices of Imperial Army. Over time they slowly acquired more authority over its regulation and international usage, areas that were originally covered by the Audit department of the tax authorities.\n\nRecently, in recognition of that change, the authority was official transfer from the auditors to the Army. As such, they felt it was appropriate for them to be included in the decision making of any initiative involving an institution they so strictly controlled, and none were in any position to argue otherwise. With that, the investigation had no choice but to turn to the monolith of military bureaucracy, if they were to have any hope of gaining access to the victim's work."

The detective paid no mind to the thin drizzle that fell from the sky, or any of the people who still wandered the streets. It had been another day of disappointment, of frustration, of failure. Every effort him and his fellow detectives had made was deflected or deferred past the point of viability. Every new path they started down was quickly bricked off and sealed away. Day by day, the lead that Kodaira had pulled from the web of information faded further into the dark. He ground his teeth.\n\n'Excuse me? Sir?' came a voice from behind him, soft in tone but firm in intent. When he turned, he was face to face with a young woman, her hair neatly braided behind her head, face covered in makeup and accented with sparkling eyeshadow. She wore a unbuttoned brown coat that reached down to her knees. But beneath it was a sparkling red dress that reached down almost as far as the coat, cut to expose one bare leg to the night air. 'I think you dropped this,' she said, extending her arms towards him.\n\nConfused, Kodaira took the parcel and turned it over in his hands. It was a plain yellow folder, unmarked and completely unfamiliar.

There were reasons why the twin branches of the military were held above the petty realm of Imperial politics. There were reasons why they maintained their own administrative channels, their own police forces, their own intelligence agencies.

Fortunately, their luck began to turn before they had taken more than a few steps back up the path.\n\nEarly one afternoon, a man came into the station, walked up to the front desk, and politely requested a meeting with the Chief. He was a tall, middle aged man, clean shaven with neatly trimmed hair, and came with a coat draped over his arm and a black leather briefcase in hand. Intrigued by the deskworker's description over of him the phone, the Chief agreed to speak with him. After the man arrived on the right floor and pulled the door to the Chief's office closed, the two were locked in conversation for the better part of an hour.\n\nEventually, the office door was pulled open again.

After a few moments they rose again as the representative came through the door, a younger man in a neatly pressed suit.\n\nAfter the greetings and formalities were done with, the three men moved on to the purpose for their visit. The two detectives took turns explaining the task they were attempting to complete and justifying their perceived need for assistance from the Bureau. The representative was generally quiet, listening intently, only occasionally raising his voice to ask a question of one of the detectives or when the discussion was in danger of stalling. Once the detectives had exhausted their reasoning, they pressed the man for a response.\n\nIn reply, he sympathized with the position held by the detectives and agreed that the investigation would likely be best suited if assisted by the Bureau, but there was a problem. The Bureau knew essentially nothing about the context of the requests or even the case as a whole. They could certainly do what was requested of them, but they needed to know why, and have some access to the case files.

The questions of how the notes got there and why were not easily answered simply because the processes and policies surrounding the rough currency were not generally well understood. Of all the contentious and convoluted systems in the Japanese Empire, the Military Yen was the least addressed. It was regarded as an artifact of the war, a temporary support system that had long overstayed its purpose of providing capital controls to newly occupied territories. But given the fact that it was really only present in the colonies and other Sphere countries, the population and government of mainland Japan had little motivation to address the issue.\n\nBecause of this, the investigation had to commit a considerable amount of effort into finding out who they could actually turn to in order to examine the presence of the military banknotes. Eventually they were pointed to a previously unheard of office called the Currency Exchange Commission, located in the Tokyo headquarters of the Ministry of Finance. But it turned out that the 'office' was little more than a handful of workers arranged in a cluster of cubicles.\n\nStill, despite the obvious lack of sufficient resources, the workers did their best to point the investigation in the right direction.

The Military Yen was controlled not only by a single office of the Imperial Japanese Army, it was controlled by two, the Army Ministry and the Army's General Staff Office Intelligence Division.\n\nThe Army Ministry, while perhaps being the most direct route given their apparent control over internal policymaking for the Military Yen, likely would not be the easiest. The Ministry was stubborn and seldom gave up information without good reason, prior communications between them and the police force had proven that. However, given the sprawling nature of the organization and the relative obscurity of the Military Yen, the relevant departments may be less wary than the central leadership.\n\nThe IJA-GSO Intelligence Division was another matter. They were a reclusive organization, reliquinishing information when it suited them and infamous for sticking its shadowy tendrils in every organization it could reach. Officially, they were administratively beneath the Army Ministry, but perhaps they would see some benefit in whispering beneath the noses of their political masters."

But after leafing through the first few pages, and taking note off the official Army symbolism and formatting, he began take it all much more seriously.\n\nThe files detailed the communications and procedures of a joint administrative project between the Tokyo Tax Bureau and the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. The project was concerned with further regulating the movement of civilian Yen throughout the Sphere by beginning to integrate the systems involved with administering the Japanese Military Yen, the rough, ad hoc currency employed for use primarily in the subordinate Sphere nations. The files outlined channels of information that would need to be erected between the project's manager, Shinji Yoshikage, and the relevant departments in the Army General Staff Office. These included numerous requests for access to files regarding the exchange programs between the civilian and military currencies.\n\nBut beyond acknowledging the existence of the program and its aims, the files still did not point to an explicit motive for Yoshikage's murder.

Therefore, the point of argument between the detectives was where this blow should be placed to be most effective.\n\nKodaira argued that they should keep their effort simple and targeted. Pull in the base commander associated with the killer and demand he talk openly or be faced with obstruction of justice charges. That way they keep the pressure in one place and potentially delay how fast the Army can respond. With a little luck, they may even be able to slide under the noses of the Army admins entirely.\n\nTachi disagreed, claiming that such an approach was too narrow in scope.

 japtouchou.67.d:0 "While the information given by the man from the Navy Ministry was not so significant of in itself, its potential implications certainly were. It seemed that the appeals to the Imperial General Headquarters by the investigation had attracted the attention of the other half of the Japanese Armed Forces. According to the testimony of the man, himself an member of the Navy Ministry, not only was the IGHQ's dismissal of the investigation unremarkable, it was downright anticipated.\n\nHe claimed that the General Headquarters had long since been gutted and largely stripped of its authority by the efforts and ambitions of the Army. Through a combination of vocal protest and outright defiance, the Army Ministry had effectively neutered any potential for an outside party to audit their inner workings. As the Headquarters was partially controlled by the Army, any mandate the organization attempted to give to the IJA would immediately result in half their staff conspiring against them. As such, it was now nearly impossible to bypass the ever-convenient claims of 'issues of national security' the Army gave whenever faced with an inquest. The papers he had provided seemed to confirm this, with dozens of reports of IGHQ efforts and functions halted in their tracks with seemingly little justification.\n\nThese considerations, while hugely impactful, were well beyond the authority of the Tokyo Police to investigate. The two detective agreed that this would require nothing less than a Cabinet level intervention. Where they disagreed, was on which part of the Cabinet they should involve. Tachi held that this was significant enough on its own to be brought before the general view of the Cabinet, while Kodaira felt they should consult their representative office in the Home Ministry, the Bureau of Public Order."

 japtouchou.68.d:0 "Despite Kodaira's insistence that giving such unrestricted access to the sensitive case files to such a potentially large group was a mistake, Tachi was hopeful the Bureau of Public Order would be able to provide them with the information they needed. Unfortunately, not long after copies of the files had been sent to the Bureau offices, a letter came that dashed his hopes almost entirely. In the letter, the Bureau informed the detectives that while what they had been asked to do was not a problem of in itself, the nature of the investigation's aimed posed problems.\n\nAccording to them, the case strayed into what they referred to as, 'administratively sensitive areas', namely the civil investigation into offenses committed by military personnel and the upward investigation of Cabinet authorities. In general circumstances, such processes were typically considered to be military and political matters due to the position of their suspects, and were thus delegated to the appropriate internal authorities. However, the case in question went even further. The Bureau cited a previously unknown resolution passed by none other than the Supreme War Council, which stated that no law enforcement agency or department of such an agency maintained the right to information currently relevant to an investigation by another agency, including both civil and military police.\n\nIn this case, the other agency was the Army, which claimed that portions of the information deemed relevant was already in use by a tangentially related internal investigation, and had to be held as secure for security reasons. Dismayed, the lead detectives sent aside any notions of help from the Bureau and turned to a new task. Finding a loophole."

At the representative's urging, he gave a rough description of the concerns held by the investigation, but ensured to withhold any identifying details. At the detective's suggestion that some members of the law enforcement staff may be complicit in a wider series of criminal activity and provided cover by some elements of high administration, the Bureau representative became very grim, asking only a few curt questions. After Kodaira put forth all he was willing to say, the man thanked the detectives for their time, and assured them that he would relay everything that they had said and report back to them shortly.\n\nNews of the Bureau's reaction to this did eventually make its way to the Tokyo station, but it came as a trickle of whispers that reached the chief's ear, rather than a standard letter or phone call. Apparently, at the suggestion of internal corruption administrative fraud, the Bureau had activated a number of internal security protocols, one of which included reporting to the Home Ministry on the nature of the situation. When the Home Ministry learned of what the concerns were, they too responded with some preventative measures, including a 'temporary evaluation in information compartmentalization'.\n\nFor the investigation, this could only mean one thing, more paperwork."

 japtouchou.70.d:0 "After a few long distance phone calls, the investigation managed to get in touch with the office in Manchuria. From what they gathered, it was a facility tucked away in the Manchurian capital of Tonghua and administered by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office. The little information that was easily publically accessible described it as the central storage and distribution point for Military Yen for northeastern China and the entirety of Korea. Naturally, it was a highly secure facility, wrapped in thick walls and patrolled by dozens of guards.\n\nBut when Detective Tachi got through to the admin offices of the facility , he was surprised by their agreeableness and openness. At first, he was concerned that this was indicative of the site leadership mishandling sensitive information, but he quickly realized it was because of another reason entirely, there was not much information to mishandle in the first place. According to the officer he spoke to on the phone, the facility only maintained records of the total quantity of currencies physically in the building at regular intervals. All records pertaining to the exchange, movement, and recipients of the military yen were maintained by some combination of the Army Ministry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Manchurian Government.\n\nWhile the officer was unable to provide Tachi with what he needed, he could offer him copies of the records of currency quantities that they had on hand. Alternatively, he could try and put him in contact with his superiors in the General Staff Office to escalate the issue."

 japtouchou.71.d:0 "Several days had passed since Kodaira had placed the mysterious files into the inconspicuous mailbox, but no word from their unseen sympathizers came. Kodaira was entirely prepared for another impromptu meeting, similar to the circumstances under which he had received the first. Every night, as he walked home, he scanned the faces of the people he passed on the dimly lit sidewalks, searching for the face of the Lady in Red or anyone else who stood out to him. The detective even found himself taking longer and less direct routes home, in subtle hope that this would somehow encourage another meeting to happen.\n\nHowever that sense of optimism did not last long, as the days continued to roll by, more doubt was thrown onto the veracity of their arrangement. Tachi even suggested that perhaps this had been a set-up on the part of the responsible parties to ensure that those files did not remain out of their intended place for long, and that there was not really any more information. Kodair, of course, had rejected such sentiments, but not as sternly as he might of done a few days earlier.\n\nThat same night, Kodaira arrived home, kicked off his shoes and hung his coat on the hook on the wall the same way he always did. There was no sign of anything unusual or out of place as he walked from his front door and into the main part of his home. But as he entered his kitchen, found a single resting on his counter where one had not been before. And on top was a small square piece of paper, with nothing written on it but his name."

 japtouchou.72.d:0 "With the investigation's focus locked onto the commander of the base in Indonesia where Takahara had been stationed, they made their move. Coordinating with local police, the investigation drafted a letter politely demanding that the Commander present himself in some form or else face charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Once the thinly veiled threats were transcribed, their Indonesian-based counterparts placed the letter in the hands of who they claimed was their fastest courier, and sent him on his way.\n\nUnsurprisingly, only a single day passed before Kodaira received a long-distance call from the Indonesian station, who informed him that the commander had responded with a hastily-typed letter of his own. Refusing to wait for the letter to be sent all the way to Japan, Kodaira insisted that they read the letter to him over the phone, against the advice of Detective Tachi.\n\nThe base commander of course furiously denied that he had anything to do with the allegations laid out by the investigation and further denied that he had every attempted to impede their progress. Beyond painstricken claims of innocence, the commander's letter strongly focused on the circumstances surrounding the mysterious grenade Takahara had employed in his plot. He felt that he was undeniably innocent of any charges related to this situation as all the files and logistical details concerning the base's inventory management had been passed to departments of the Navy. This was truly an incredible claim, so incredible that Kodaira outright refused to believe it. He insisted that this was yet another deflection and demanded direct communication from the commander so he could 'hear his voice when he spews such nonsense'."

It seemed that the moment that the paperwork was placed in the hands of the workers at the Cabinet's general offices, a storm of controversy engulfed the whole forum. Of course the mere implication that some subversive action had been carried out by the Army kicked off an accompanying flurry of speculation, further straining the already tense situation.\n\nThe representatives of the Army Ministry systematically alternated between unflinching defences of their position and fiery attacks on the motivations behind the demands. They claimed that the oversight of internal military systems and operations of law enforcement were specifically designed to be seperate from domestic civil authorities in the interests of national security and administrative autonomy. In the next breath they denied the legitimacy of the investigation's pursuits, claiming they had already provided enough information to reach reasonable conclusions and the continued efforts to subvert the established separation of authorities was tantamount to political tampering.\n\nThe subtle insinuation that all external oversight into the Army was illegitimate did not sit well with many of the Ministries of State, some grumbling with concerns about precedents and procedures. But many others tacitly supported some of the key points given by the Army, agreeing in principle with some concerns of practice. But the powerhouses of the Home Ministry and Navy Ministry remained silent, forcing the Cabinet into gridlock, leaving the pressure to build even further."

 japtouchou.74.d:0 "Tackling a resolution passed by the Supreme War Council as a critical matter of state was certainly no easy task. Even if a logically coherent loophole could be found somewhere is its construction, that did not mean the relevant authorities were liable to accept it. It was more than likely that if the detectives sauntered up to the Council and slyly claimed that by their own words they were forced to comply with the investigation's requests, the Council would simply claim the line of reasoning intentionally subverts the purpose of the resolution and constitutes political interference.\n\nWith that understood, Kodaira pushed his partner and their subordinates to search for a means by which they could convince the Council that it was in their best interests to carry out the requests they had made of them. The less 'creative interpretation' required to achieve that effect, the better. Sure enough, with some careful reading and comparison to legal precedents, they found their angle.\n\nThere were only two authorities which could reliably override the consequences of the resolution. The first was the Emperor himself, which came as little surprise. Second, however, was a subclause granting authority to the Council as a whole to disregard the decision of one of its subordinate offices. It could be invoked if the Council was presented reasonable evidence that a third party held some information that would be pertinent to a sufficient resolution of the internal investigation. If accepted, the relevant office would have to openly corroborate their information with that of the third party. In this case, that would provide the investigation with everything they needed, and maybe even result in the Army's closely held secrets to come spilling out."

 japtouchou.75.d:0 "As if the Home Ministry's decision to apply extra measures of scrutiny and security to the flow of information didn't hinder the investigation enough, it seemed that word of their worries had reached other offices of the Imperial Cabinet. At first the wider response was nothing more than isolated murmurs of speculation and gossip, but soon that gave way to action.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the first office to leap at the opportunity to enforce stricter rules over their knowledge was the Army Ministry. Only a few days after the investigation had learned of the Home Ministry's decisions, similar stories began to flow from the ranks of the Army and their supervisors. They were quick to clamp down on the avenues of inter-Ministry communication, placing elevated checks and additional clearance processes on many of such systems.\n\nBeyond that they had issued strict commands to the offices beneath them. The Intelligence Division of the General Staff Office was to be isolated, reporting directly to Ministry leadership instead. Furthermore, and most relevantly in the detective's' eyes, they ordered changes in the procedures of the various military police units. This included stronger standards on which information could be given out, on the basis of 'protecting sensitive content from potentially compromised civil authorities'. However Detective Tachi was quick to note that they left the definition of 'sensitive' up to interpretation. Was it sensitive to the interests of the nation as a whole, or just to them?"

 japtouchou.76.t:0 "Balancing Act"
 japtouchou.76.d:0 "Eventually, the files promised by the facility detailing the currency balances arrived at the Tokyo station in the hands of a courier. It came in a thick brown cardboard box, tightly sealed with evenly applied strips of tape wrapping around its sides. Once the tape was cut away and the lib pried off, the detectives were relieved to find it filled with neatly organized and labeled folders, ordered in the box by date. Each folder contained a few pages of standardized and precisely formatted spreadsheets and accompanying pages of notes and contextual information. In all, it was a blessed relief from the disorderly bureaucracy they had been stumbling through previously.\n\nWhile the files did not contain any specifically identifying information as they had be forewarned, it still did provide some context for the going-ons of the region's military yen systems. It turned out that the facility also served as a temporary holding site for normal, 'civilian' yen that had been exchanged for its military counterpart. For the most part, the quantity fluctuated in fairly regular amounts over regular periods of time, keeping in line with the monetary policies of the Japanese and Manchurian governments. But occasionally it would change in irregularly large amounts both in a positive and negative direction.\n\nMore noteworthy was the fact that instances of this irregularity seemed to increase in the lead up to the day when the inciting crime was committed. Closer scrutiny revealed another curious pattern, occasionally the amount of civilian yen would increase or decrease but with no accompanying change in the amount of military notes. How was this possible? And if that money was not exchanged, where did it go?"

After another phone call or two, this time with one of the relevant officers who preferred not to give his family name, that was revealed to be only somewhat true. For the most part, the only information the Intelligence division could give them was how little information they actually had.\n\nPer the testimony of the Intelligence officer, the part of the Division concerned with the Military Yen actually had only one real function in that respect, tracking the distribution and rough movement of the Military Notes as they moved about the sphere. As far as he knew, which he assured the detectives was rather far, the whole Intelligence Division didn't have a single file concerning the actual exchange of individual notes, just the movement of set quantities of bills from one place to the other.\n\nTo make matters worse the officer could not even assure the detectives that they would be able to see the files for themselves either. However, to their surprise, he assured them that he would do his best to track down who had the exchange files and report back to them. Apparently, he had suspected something afoul in the system for some time, and was determined to bring an end to it one way or another."

 japtouchou.78.d:0 "Knowing the typical disposition of the Army Ministry, the staff of the Investigation prepared for a long bureaucratic struggle to wrest the details of the Military Yen Exchange systems from their grasp. In particular, the two lead detectives spent a good deal of time preparing both administratively, by collecting names and phone numbers of people they would likely need to contact, and mentally for the clash with the stubborn Army representatives.\n\nAs such, Tachi and Kodaira were among the most blindsided when they received a reply from the Ministry in an acceptably short timeframe which contained a relatively informative amount of information. They provided a short stack of papers detailing the absolute and relative exchange rates between Military and Civil Yen, broken down by region and Sphere nation. They also took the time to acknowledge the various facilities responsible for facilitating these systems of exchange and their governing offices.\n\nThere were two things the pile of papers did not include however, which was the justification for the shifting exchange rates, and the records of the specific bills that were being exchanged at any given time. According to them, neither of those sets of records were under the control of the Army at all. They were under the control of the Navy Ministry."

After leaving a few curt messages with his secretary, they had arranged for a call to take place between the detectives and the commander, where they would have to chance to ask all the questions they desired and mull over the answers. When the time came, Tachi, Kodaira, and the team's minute-taker filed into a bare and empty office and crowded around the solitary phone sat on the desk.\n\nFor two and a half hours, the two men dragged the commander through the phone lines, sternly issuing questions and harshly demanding clarity in his answers. The commander in return responded in a firm, calm tone, but at the pace of a man weighing his words with his life. In great detail, he described how the Navy came to partially control the records for the base's ever-shifting inventory, and why they should be the point of the investigation's focus. Officially, the base was located in a place that was, 'practically and strategically inconvenient' with respect to the Army's supply chain. The Army sought to resolve this by contracting the Navy to run supplies to the base during their usual movements.\n\nMuch to everyone's surprise, the Navy agreed, on the sole condition that they would maintain the records involved with shipping the supplies for 'redundancy purposes'. The Army, apparently seeing no harm in this, accepted. So, the commander explained, if a grenade had indeed been smuggled off the base but resulted in no inconsistency in the records, the only possible point of manipulation was in the Navy."

The Navy Ministry, which up until that point had remained mostly silent and seemingly withdrawn from the issue, put for their first statement since the whole affair began. But as they quickly made clear, the statement did not come from the Ministry itself, in a sense, rather they were giving it on the request of the Navy General Staff Office. But the position put forth by what was thought to be the Army's fierce rival was almost unbelievable.\n\nThe Staff Office justified the relevance of providing their opinion on the basis of their shared membership on the Supreme War Council with the Army Ministry, which they claimed played an essential military and political role. They initially reiterated the Army's positions on the preservation of the independence of organizations and potential security ramifications, but afterwards made a much stronger claim. They maintained that the rights to exclusive authority over legal investigation of military affairs rested solely with the internal system of the respective branch purely on the basis of military operational security. By this fact alone, they claimed, no other non-superordinate office of state could attempt to subvert the judgement of said systems without violating systematic independence.\n\nThe investigation team was left baffled, none more so than the lead detectives. They had fully anticipated that all the elements of the Navy would have taken this opportunity to assert dominance over their bureaucratic rival, not stand by their side. Of all the times the Navy could have chosen to develop a sense of solidarity, why now?"

 japtouchou.81.d:0 "With their avenue of approach found, the investigation wasted no time in assembling their case for presentation before the Supreme War Council. The whole process of outlining the nature of the circumstances, as well as the justification for their appeal, was overseen by the critical gaze of the two chief detectives, and occasionally by the chief as well. They were careful to ensure that the manner of their presentation was conducive to their actual aims. They had to strike a careful balance between providing enough information to justify their relevance to the Army's investigation, but not so much that it risked betraying the wider suspected conspiratorial elements of the case or implied a degree of political motivation.\n\nTo achieve this, they attempted to format the appeal in such a way as to play off the internal dynamics of the Council, rather than address it as a totality. The Council was formed by the Army Ministry and General Staff Office, the Navy Ministry and General Staff Office, the Ministry of Foreign affairs, and the Office of the Prime Minister of the Imperial Diet, providing a host of considerations to take advantage of. Obviously, the Army offices would dig in their heels and flatly refuse to accept the position, that was well understood. But the involvement of their stauch rival, whose presence the investigation was sure to subtly emphasize, may motivate the offices of the Navy to show some sympathy.\n\nGiven that, it came as a rather extreme surprise when the investigation received word that not only had their appeal been quickly denied, but some of the strongest opposition had come from the representatives of the Navy. They had launched into an unprecedented defense of their rival hinged on the mutual agreement of the two branches on the suppression of political intrusion. Never in the history of the Empire had the Navy put forward such a position on principle alone. The detectives of the investigation could not believe it. And thus, they would not believe it."

 japtouchou.82.t:0 "Security in Subtlety"
 japtouchou.82.d:0 "The timing and speed of the Army's response to murmurs of corruption circulating through the Cabinet had drawn the suspicion of the investigation and its lead detectives. It seemed rather suspicious that the militarized bureaucrats would so openly take measures that would inhibit the progress of a criminal investigation that involved one of their personnel. Indeed it seemed that if the Army were truly concerned with the identification and elimination of corruption, they would expose their inner workings to the light of the public eye, not push them deeper into the dark. But as eyebrow-raising as their actions were, the actions of their twin were far more questionable.\n\nThroughout the totality of the investigation up to this point, the offices of the Imperial Navy had remained silent observers of the whole affair, rarely ever giving any comment or taking any action in response to the proceedings. So when the gears of Naval administration finally began to turn, many were quick to report on the pitch of their creaks and groans. As quietly as a branch of international military organization could, they slowly began isolating and freezing their internal departments and the information they held.\n\nRather than loudly declare the sealing of specific departments as their rival had done, the Navy's actions were learned through the flow of common chatter of office workers. Officers of the Navy would seemingly select files, case records, and personnel at random and whisk them away to more 'secure positions'. Records kept in one place for years were suddenly reorganized and authorities that had been granted long ago were revoked without warning. But why would the Navy be so concerned with corruption allegations that did not involve them? And why be so secretive about the process?"

But despite all their efforts, no reasonably suitable explanation could be found, and so the detectives were nearly forced to conclude that the files had been tampered with. Frustrated, they again tried to make contact with workers at the facility to confront them about this issue. Fortunately, when they did eventually get in touch with the facility over the phone, the responding officer was the same one who had helped them previously.\n\nWhen the detectives first explained the situation and their concerns to him, he seemed confused, uncertain what they could be referring to. But after a few moments of consideration, he realised what the detectives were observing, and explained to them that it was actually a misunderstanding. The instances where no change in the quantity of military yen banknotes was not a mistake, because an exchange had actually taken place. On those occasions, an exchange had indeed taken place between regular and military notes, but another exchange had taken place at the same time, between two different types of military yen.\n\nSome older prints of the military yen were extremely basic and lacked serial numbers or any kind of individualizing mark. The Manchurian facility had a fair few of these bills in storage, so on a few occasions when some of the military notes were to be exchanged for regular notes, some of the unmarked notes were replaced with newer notes with serial numbers, keeping the total quantity the same as before the exchange. As Tachi began to ask what became of the unmarked notes and what part of the Army was responsible for handling them, the officer interrupted him. It was not the Army who was in charge of transporting the supposedly phased out bills, it was the Navy."

Tachi on the other hand, had not entirely lost hope, and maintained they should give the Intelligence Officer a few more days before coming to any hasty conclusions.\n\nSure enough, just a day later at around half past four in the afternoon, just as Tachi was about to step out the door to leave for the day, his desk phone rank. After scurrying to pick it up, the detective was greeted by the reassuring voice of Officer Shinzo. He was happy to report that by combing through the files and conversing with some of his colleagues, he managed to track down the Military Yen Exchange records as well as the office that controlled them.\n\nThe answer caught Tachi by surprise, so much so that he had to asked the officer to repeat what he said, in order to make sure he hadn't misheard him. All records and accounts concerned with the specific exchanges of Military Notes were not under the control of the Army at all, they were actually under the control of the Navy, the Navy's General Staff Office to be exact."

As such they were forced to start from the very bottom, at the secretaries of the Central Office, and work their way up to the right department when they eventually found out what it actually was.\n\nWhere the Army Ministry had graced the investigation with their cooperation, it seemed their Naval counterpart was in no such mood. It took the better part of a week for the Navy to respond to their initial request, but even then their response merely directed them to another obscure department to start the process all over again.And then, when that department learned that the Investigation was concerned specifically with the exchange of specific military notes, there was a whole other process with its own set of hoops to jump through.\n\nFinally, one blessed morning a government courier arrived bearing a set of files marked as being from the Navy Ministry Headquarters, ostensibly containing the exchange records they had been after for so long. But any feelings of elation dissipated only a few moments after the lead detectives read the first few lines. According to the Navy the specific notes they were concerned with were part of a 'stabilizing buyback program' implemented to curb local inflation, and as such, should be of no meaningful interest to the Investigation's goals."

But where the previous papers had borne the symbols and headers of the Imperial Japanese Army or the Tokyo Tax Bureau, this paper was claimed by the Navy, specifically the Navy Ministry.\n\nBut the Navy's proud iconography was one of the few pieces of intelligible information present on the page. Because where the previous files had been clear and candid about their content, this one had been intentionally made to hide all that it could. The file was liberally coated in the thick black ink the government censors were so fond of. Whole sentences, even paragraphs were turned into rows of black rectangles, any meaning blotted out by the careful hands of bureaucracy.\n\nThere were only a few key pieces of information that could be pulled from what remained of the paper's particulars. First was the name of the Minezaka Conglomerate, the commercial-industrial group that owned the plant where Yoshikage's body had been found.

Furthermore the parallel investigation method that had served them so well at the start was now beginning to cause the various teams to stumble over each other and on more than one occasion found themselves uncovering or dealing with redundant information.\n\nTo that end, the two head detectives decided it was time to simplify the investigation process by pursuing one lead in particular. They figured that if the leads already overlapped this much, then following one to its end should lead to the resolution of all of them.

Given the geographically fragmented nature of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, shipping became a foundational industry of in itself. Wherever an organization found some international commercial interest, private or Imperial, the captains of the sea lanes were sure to follow.\n\nTo that end, the shipping industry had taken on a sprawling character, with interests and offices in every field and in every nation and region in the Sphere. In order to have any chance of finding useful information, the Investigation would have to narrow their search to the particular area that was likely to be relevant to the case."

 japtouchou.89.d:0 "Like its Army twin, the Navy Ministry was a monolithic titan of Imperial administration. There were few bodies in the entire Empire that could claim as much influence or wield as much authority as the total combined might of the Japanese Navy. And among the few who did hold legal authority either equal or above that of the Ministry, only the offices of the Emperor himself could reliably hold them accountable.\n\nThis reality was ever present in the minds of the Investigation's lead detectives, gnawing at the edges of their psyche as they planned their routes of inquiry into the Ministry. As with the Army Ministry, they anticipated a difficult bureaucratic struggle against the internal Departments of the Navy. But in this case, their leads were much less clearly refined in scope, and they had half the number of contacts. In order to have any hope of following the case all the way through, the Investigation would have to be very precise in their choice of targets."

They staunchly refused to answer to any authority but that of the Emperor by means of the Imperial General Headquarters, and now even that leash had begun to grow slack. Their performance against the Allied navies and the lauding they received from the public in the afterglow of victory had only emboldened them further, allowing them to secure a measure of political power of their own.\n\nThis meant that they were regarded as an entirely separate beast from the monolithic Navy Ministry. Where the Army Ministry and General Staff Office were generally regarded as two faces of the same machine, the Navy Ministry often found itself blustering and stumbling after the Navy General Staff Office while they steamed ahead without a single damn about the 'political ramifications' of their policies.\n\nWhile the Office's responsibilities were technically 'limited' to those concerning operational command, in reality this gave them a far reaching and broadly defined authority over Imperial seagoing affairs. Given this huge sprawl of administration, the Investigation would need to be very precise in their inquiries."

 japtouchou.91.d:0 "The central point of consideration with respect to the shipping situation was the unprecedented level of cooperation between the twin branches of the military, who only took a rest from fighting each other with words when there was someone to be fought with bullets. Indeed even during the War, it had been an open secret that the Navy was deeply displeased with their assigned duties of resupplying the Army during their various campaigns. They grumbled that they had been demoted to the 'errand boys of the Empire', but they complied nonetheless, out of fear of bringing down the ire of the Emperor and the fearsome Prime Minister Tojo.\n\nSo why now, in times of uneasy peace, would the Navy reverse their position entirely, and carry out what seemed to be far more menial tasks without the slightest bit of coaxing or threatening? From the exterior, the disposition of the two organizations seemed to be the same as always. The constant war of words between the two had been no different prior to the start of the Investigation, there was the same level of bickering and debating over marginal and pedantic issues. Was it perhaps the case that these arguments were merely a facade to cover some deeper coordination?\n\nIn order to determine if such things were actually the case, they would first need to understand the full extent of their relationship.

 japtouchou.92.d:0 "Since the start of the Investigation proper, the tendrils of the Imperial Military and the Minezaka Conglomerate had spiraled around each other endlessly. Wherever the one was concerned, the other always seemed to appear in one way or another. At first, it had seemed that the Army was the primary participant in the collaboration between Military and Industrial parties. But as time went on, the Navy's influence was seen and felt in more and more places, until it was obvious that it was the dominant party in the partnership.\n\nAs such, in the later stages of the investigation most of the effort had gone to trying to find the point of overlap between the Conglomerate and the Navy. Now, with the new information they had accumulated, the two organization's mutual interests in international shipping may prove to be a good candidate for that point's location.\n\nIn order to properly assess this possibility, the Investigation would need to review two sources of information. First was the forward facing information from the Navy regarding their contracts with private industries, which they used as a subtle means to entice more competitive offers. Second was the reports issued by the Minezaka Conglomerate itself with the similar aim of enticing further investment by demonstrating their political legitimacy. And besides, what businessmen would pass up the opportunity to rub his military contracts in the faces of his rivals?"

 japtouchou.93.t:0 "The Big Fiscal Picture"
 japtouchou.93.d:0 "As the Investigation examined the administration of the Japanese Military Yen, they were steadily led closer and closer to the embrace of the Imperial Navy. Initially most had assumed that the Military Yen would have been an administrative area thoroughly spearheaded by the Imperial Army, given the currency's purported purpose. But it seemed that nearly all aspects of its management, from tax and exchange regulation to movement and issuing of banknotes, had slowly been given over to the Navy.\n\nTo a certain extent it did make some sense, after all, the Military Yen was a fundamentally international currency and the Navy was among the most suited to movement between the Sphere nations. However one would have thought that the Army would have objected to the sudden concentration of monetary power in the hands of their rival, but there was no indication of any such objections being raised.\n\nBut even with such intense centralization of powers the systems of the Military Yen seemed to be in perpetual disarray. Tracking down any particular set of records had so far proven to be an obnoxiously tedious task, with hardly any paper trail to rely on. As such, in an ironic sort of way, the Investigation had to take an extremely wide look at the general usage of the Military Yen in order to have any hopes of deriving and identifying a particular area that would be relevant to the case."

 japtouchou.94.t:0 "Solidarity Among Seamen"
 japtouchou.94.d:0 "Each of the Imperial military branches had developed in such a way that they were effectively split in two along an administrative-operational divide. The administrative side of each branch was handled by their respective Ministry, which also served to officially manage the branches' political affairs and representation in the Imperial Cabinet. For operational affairs, each branch had a General Staff Office, responsible for the planning and execution of military plans required for national defense as well as most matters related to intelligence and supply chains.\n\nBut in both cases, neither of the two halves were so willing to surrender all their influence for the sake of avoiding redundancy. Particularly in the Imperial Navy, the General Staff Offices still held a good deal of political sway which they effectively used as clubs to knock aside any opposition, while the Ministries were sure to keep and cultivate intelligence webs that rivaled their official counterparts.\n\nBut in the circumstances of this particular case, the areas of suspicious were not where the two halves of the Navy drifted apart and quarreled, but where they came together and agreed. It was the joint opinion of the two detectives that if the murder and associated conspiratorial elements were stemming from some disunity, there would have been some associated fanfare. The silent conduct of the suspected parties only betrayed their real motivations. They were hiding something."
 japtouchou.94.a:0 "But what?"
 japtouchou.95.t:0 "Two Hunches and a Gut Feeling"
 japtouchou.95.d:0 "While the Investigation now understood that the primary administrative authority over affairs concerning the Military Yen had been handed over to the Imperial Navy in general, what was not clear was how this authority was actually bureaucratically administered. Now officially, the Navy Ministry and General Staff Office were the 'two faces of the same mind', but in reality there existed a considerable degree of separation between them, sometimes even resulting in internal tensions. Clearly the Ministry was involved with representing the management of the Military Yen in the political realm, but what was the IJN-GSO's role?\n\nThe Investigation did have some vague understand of some of the Staff Office's responsibilities based on their prior inquiries. It was clear that they were involved with the physical movement of the Military banknotes for one thing, likely for security reasons. This in turn suggested that they also must have some form of banknote records for the purposes of redundancy and security checks.\n\nOf these two supposed responsibilities, the latter appeared to be more informationally relevant to the lead detectives. But they were still faced with a simple, yet formidable obstacle, they did not actually know where such files were kept. Previous failed inquiries combined with restrictive measures enacted by the various offices had failed to provide an obvious path to accessing those records. If the Investigation was to succeed in this lead, they would first need to get past square one."

 japtouchou.96.t:0 "Peacetime Preoccupations"
 japtouchou.96.d:0 "By reviewing a combination of public resolutions and documents from the Imperial Diet, as well as some low level materials from the Imperial General Headquarters, the two detectives were able to assemble a rough outline of the shipping scheme between the two branches of the Imperial Military. It seemed that since the end of the War, each branch had needed to find a new outlet to commit their energies and resources to. For the Army, this had been consolidating the Japanese grip on the various nations of Eastern Asia. In some cases, this meant deploying troops and building bases in the various hostile environments of South East Asia, and in others it meant providing advisors and other support for the various friendly regimes of the Sphere.\n\nBut that Navy did not have the luxury of such obviously defined goals. For so long their primary objective had been to build up their strength until they could match and overcome that of the Allied fleets. But when that once-impossible goal and been achieved, the Navy was found struggling for purpose in their now uncontested rule of the Eastern seas. This uncertainty was the foundations of what would become the Imperial Navy's shipping program. The Army's continual need for supplies served as a means for the Navy to bolster the size of their fleet as well as hold additional sway over the affairs of the Japanese merchant marine.\n\nBut the Navy's scheme did not end with military affairs, in recent years they had been granted charters and administrative rights over a range of commercial shipping and supplying areas. While technically removed from the shipping concerns of the Army, it did encompass a large amount of the Navy's attention, and very well could still be related in some way."

 japtouchou.97.d:0 "Further scrutiny into the material nature of the Navy's shipping relationship with the Army eventually did produce results. The Army's ongoing goals of consolidating military power and suppressing nationalist resistance required a constant reserve of combat-ready troops. For the sake of administrative convenience, these generally consisted of a mix of Japanese consucripts, volunteers from other Sphere nations, and 'volunteers' from other Sphere nations. To further simplify the process, fresh recruits would receive a cursory round of initial training before being shipped off to their deployment locations where it would be completed in a more intense second round.\n\nAs such, the Army required a steady supply of munitions and equipment to sufficiently train their divisions, as well as a means to remove the remains of expended equipment to keep their storage facilities clean. This is where the Navy came in. The facilitated both those roles to meet the needs of the Army, the only price they asked in return was funding for additional ships as well as some administrative authority over the processes.\n\nThis could provide a likely way by which Ryo Takahara could have smuggled the explosives he planted in Yoshikage's corpse without attracting the attention of his immediate superiors. If the explosives had been smuggled out due to some bureaucratic oversight or malicious intent, the fault landed within the Navy's shipping records."
 japtouchou.97.a:0 "Now the hunt really begins"
 japtouchou.98.t:0 "Growing Ever Fonder"
 japtouchou.98.d:0 "As expected, the public facing reports of the Minezaka Conglomerate and administrative elements of the Navy provided some insight to their relationship. Over the course of the past ten years or so, the Navy had signed a number of contracts with the Conglomerate of varying natures. The initial ones were ostensibly simple purchases, including things from food rations to industrial maintenance supplies. The only thing slightly unusual was that the contracts indicated that the Navy would be responsible for nearly all aspects of shipping related to these agreements without any indication of a corresponding price adjustment.\n\nThe more recent contracts involved much more complex and long term agreements. This included things from multi-year perpetual purchasing commitments to usage of certain facilities by the other party. Even more surprising was that on a few occasions the Conglomerate had sign a contract with a third party organization, but the Navy still agreed to ship their wares for them at a comparatively competitive rate even though they had no obvious vested interest. Of course these deals were less proudly displayed by the two organizations and most information about them came from obscure areas of public record.\n\nFor the perspective of the two lead detectives, they had two viable angles of investigation. One option was to go after the shipping records associated with the contracts to ensure the real deals matched up with the paper agreements. Or otherwise they could use these contracts as a rough guide to estimating the Minezaka Conglomerate's international profits and assets."

 japtouchou.99.d:0 "A closer look at the Navy's involvement in intra-Sphere industrial shipping reveal a number of trends. First and foremost, was the persistent contact between them and the Minezaka Conglomerate. Though the Departments of the Navy Ministry did make deals and collaborate with many of companies and conglomerates of Japan, none were so specifically and consistently tied to shipping. This was further amplified by another trend, the recurring usage of Military Yen in the payment of these industrial contracts, most consistently in the fulfillment of contracts with the Minezaka Conglomerate, to be precise.\n\nThis had not been immediately apparent to the Investigation, it was first noticed by Detective Tachi when he had difficulty tracking down the associated payments in the Navy's public budget records. After further scrutiny he found that the records were part of the Military Yen departments,as the transaction files were always stored with those associated with the currency they were fulfilled with.\n\nBut this begged the obvious question as to why the Minezaka Conglomerate would ever accept such a form of payment, let alone request it. From all outside perspectives, the Military Yen was a derelict currency, poorly administered and of questionable value outside specific geographic regions. What value could such a currency hold to a powerful financial group in one of the strongest nations on Earth?"
 japtouchou.99.a:0 "There has to be more to it."
 japtouchou.100.t:0 "The Unofficial Merchant Marine"
 japtouchou.100.d:0 "To tackle the task of locating the point of collaboration between the two halves of the Navy, as well as its purpose and potentially associated criminal motivations, the two lead detectives made a brief return to their initial strategy. Accompanied by a small group of hand-picked officers, Kodaira would examine the ongoing projects, directives, and expenses of the Navy's General Staff Office, while Tachi would do the same for the Navy Ministry. Then, they would compare the results of their parallel inquiries and attempt to find where they aligned in a noteworthy manner.\n\nSure enough, they were able to find their overlap. In recent years both halves of the Naval bureaucracy had enacted a number of programs concerned with promoting intra-Sphere commercial shipping and bringing the Navy's oversight closer to the shipping systems that already exist. This included offering a number of lucrative contracts to various companies as well as providing easy means of commercial transport, such as cargo ships and planes. In a sense, through the combined efforts of the two Navy offices, they had managed to cultivate an unofficial Merchant Marine almost entirely under the watchful eye of Naval administration.\n\nThis strict subordinate nature of the system combined with the apparent tendency to use the Military Yen and other roundabout means of payment made it difficult to get a decent estimate of the size of the shipping racket they ran. There were two ways the Investigation could go about this, they could try to get a sense of the revenue streams of the Navy's shipping, or they could try and get a sense of their market strategy and reverse engineer it from that."

 japtouchou.101.d:0 "The two head detectives of the Investigation did get their answer from the Navy General Staff Office about the whereabouts of the Military Yen banknote files. But the answer they received was more troublesome than the question it was intended to answer. It was the kind of answer that men like Kodaira and Tachi couldn't just respond to, because it resonated with an almost existential worry. It was the kind of answer one whispered into half empty beer glasses, or while turning a carton of cigarettes to ash.\n\nThe answer was that there basically were no files. At first the representative who spoke to the two detectives over the phone sounded sheepish, like he was being forced to cover for some mistake. But as the call went on, it became clear that the representative's meekness was him attempting to be polite while correcting what he perceived to be an obvious misunderstanding on the part of the detectives.\n\nAccording to the Staff Office, the files they were asking for really only every temporarily existed at best, or existed only in theory at worst. Furthermore, they claimed that the real purpose of the Military Yen was to 'facilitate regional military-industrial development' and that expecting it to have all the records and controls associated with a 'proper currency' was expecting too much out of the military currency entirely. This was essentially an echo of similar sentiments that the officers and detectives of the Investigation had received earlier, that they were dealing with a relic of Japanese administration, a forgotten footnote of financial policy. But if it really were so irrelevant, why did it seem to be packed into every layer of this case?"

 japtouchou.102.d:0 "After an initial foray into the process of securing the shipping records they needed, the Investigation's lead detectives concluded that it would be a much more involved process than it appears from the outset. It seemed that a lot of the information restrictions on shipping schedules and details that were put into place during wartime still lingered to some degree. One could not simply walk up to the nearest Port Authority and expect to be granted access, you needed to have some overarching reason and a good sense of the relevant records.\n\nThe Investigation's case further complicated the issue because of the nature of the shipping they were investigating. It existed in a grey area between private-industrial and public-military shipping. As such, some aspects of the records were under the jurisdiction of Civil organizations, granting access to some information, while the only complete inventory of the relevant ships may lie under military authority.\n\nIn order to resolve this, Kodaira and Tachi would need to construct a watertight and convincing narrative to gain persistent, unfettered access to the necessary files. To achieve that there was only cover that would carry enough force behind it to push past any opposition, a general Administrative Audit of the international shipping authorities. And with just a single call to their contacts in the Board of Audit, the process began."

 japtouchou.103.d:0 "Without the benefit of one central office or authority to look towards in order to gather information about the financials of the Naval-Industrial shipping scheme, Detectives Tachi and Kodaira were forced to do it by hand, in a way. They would have to start by selecting a particular contract between the Navy and an industrial conglomerate, usually Minezaka, and making note of its agreed payment and signed date.\n\nThen the Detectives had to corroborate this information with two additional sources. First, was the expenditures of the Navy, which was fairly easy to track give its semi-public nature. Second was the finances of the Minezaka conglomerate, which had to be derived from the organizations profit reports and traceable tax forms. And finally, after hours upon hours of the intellectually painful process of comparing, recording, and re-comparing various financial figures, they made a breakthrough.\n\nThe financial records of the two groups, the Navy and the conglomerate, simply did not match up. The profit reports posted by Minezaka from fulfillment of contracts totaled much higher than they should have been based on the contract reports. And oftentimes the real amount of Yen spent by the Navy was less than the amount they should have. It was obvious that some form of financial tampering was occuring, likely with the assistance of the Military Yen, but without coherent records it would be impossible to locate, let alone prove. There was only one, drastic action that might get them access to the evidence they needed, an unannounced wave of Imperial Audits."

 japtouchou.104.d:0 "With the detectives' leads quickly beginning to run short, more decisive, stronger actions became more and more appealing. The implicitly shadowy nature of the Imperial Navy's involvement with financial conglomerates in international commercial interests made it extremely difficult for the Investigation to track down relevant information. Beyond that, given the number of different sub-companies and proxy deals the Navy dealt with, it was almost impossible to direct their focus at one particular office for maximized results. Almost.\n\nIn their inquiries, the detectives stumbled upon an obscure organization, whose name appeared in hardly any documents from the Imperial Cabinet. During the war a administrative structure was created to coordinate operations between the civilian government and military bureaucracies, the Imperial General Headquarters-Government Liaison Conference. At the time, this had granted some degree of administrative control over commercial and industrial shipping movements. After the war it seemed the Navy had particularly enjoyed this newfound power, and so successfully lobbied for the creation of a similar body, The Imperial General Headquarters-Industrial Interests Liaison Conference.\n\nThis body, staffed by key officers from both branches of the military and representatives from approved financial conglomerates, was ostensibly in charge of reviewing and handling the processes related to military contracts. Apparently, they were responsible for overseeing the financial logistics as well as ensuring security and legal directives were adhered to. If there was ever a department of state to hit with a general administrative audit, it was this one."

But in the case of the Investigation, the success of Japanese international shipping, now know to be under the watchful guidance of the Imperial Navy, proved to be a serious problem.\n\nGiven the international nature of the case, the whole list of shipping files that could potentially be relevant were spread across a number of offices underneath a number of different authorities. But most glaring was the divide in the Port Authorities between the domestic ports on mainland Japan, and the international 'colonial' ports spread around the Sphere nations. Each contained such a vast internal administration that the Investigation was forced to focus on just one if they were to have any hope of making progress at all.\n\nEach posed their own challenges. The Domestic Port Authority was likely to have more robust and multi-layered bureaucracy than the Sphere Port Authorities. But, in turn, the Colonial Ports were more likely to be under the direct sway of the Navy's influence, who would be more proactive in defending their information."

Given the degree to which the area of shipping they were concerned with was so fundamentally tied with Navy, they would likely still be subjected to some of the pushback and bureaucratic obfuscation that they received from the military branches prior to this.\n\nThis was further complicated by the fact that the Navy's shipping scheme existed in a grey area outside normal administrative authority. Rather than be directly created and maintained by a single office, the desired effect of the program was produced by coordinated initiatives carried out by a group of Naval and Financial organizations. And while an administrative audit may be a powerful tool, it was not a free pass to all areas of the Empire, if they wanted to be effective, they would have to first be selective.\n\nTo that end they were presented with an choice of orientations to start their audit out with. The could focus their efforts on the Colonial Ports spread throughout the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and attempt to take advantage of any regional autonomy that existed. Or they could eschew the subtlety and directly hit the departments of the Navy directly responsible for managing their part of the shipping program."

The roles and function of the Imperial General Headquarters were well known to the Investigation's staff. It was the body responsible for coordinating policy and operations between the two branches of the military, and was directed by the Offices of the Emperor himself.\n\nThe 'Industrial Interests Liaison' was a different story however. It was a loose council of industrial and financial representatives and experts that seemed to have been formed specifically to be a part of the Conference organization. The actual members of the Liaison however, had to be approved by the Imperial General Headquarters before the Conference could convene. But in many cases 'approved' could be substituted with 'selected' without much loss of accuracy when dealing with the IGH, leaving the detectives to question the Liaison's real independence.\n\nEither side of the Conference was considered to be a viable path to investigate, however each came with their own challenges. For one, they could focus on the Military's side of the conference, mostly concerned with the logistics of international shipping. Alternatively, they could turn to the Industrial Liaison, who were likely to be the dominant party in financial negotiations, and examine the actual contracts that had been agreed upon."

 japtouchou.108.d:0 "The administrative command over the Port Authority that regulated the ports of mainland Japan rested primarily with the Bureau of Customs, itself a department within the Ministry of Finance. However in recent years, some power had become regionalized, with local government offices having some sway in customs management. This was especially true of the authorities close to one of the large customs houses in Yokohama, Kobe, Osaka, Nagasaki, Moji, Nagoya and Hakodate. Originally these were intended to be under the direct administration of the Ministry of Finance, but by the time the Japanese trade stranglehold over Eastern Asia reached its peak, they had become powerful semi-autonomous entities in their own right.\n\nThese customs houses seemed like strong candidates for fruitful audits, it was just a matter of picking which one to target specifically. The two lead detectives clashed initially over what their standard for choosing should be, either absolute political strength or closest direct association with the case. Eventually, they settled on the customs house in Yokohama, given its relative proximity to Tokyo as well as it being the presumed office which handled the imports and exports of the plant where the original murder had taken place.\n\nSo, with the backing of the Imperial Board of Audit, the detectives of the Investigation drafted the necessary paperwork and prepped their teams for this new push.

There was a two way effect from this, most obvious was that with the presence of military equipment came heightened security, which was also partial applied to non-military products that passed through the ports. But in the reverse direction, some of the standard, organizational methods, and transport routines associated with the profit-driven efficiency of private industry had bled into the Navy's conduct towards their military equipment.\n\nWhile this jumble was certainly confusing and proved difficult to parse, the sheer presence of the confusion was somewhat indicative of in itself. The Navy's interests had clearly become deeply intertwined with those of private industry on a very practical, material level, not just in rhetoric and disposition as had been previously suspected. And of course, wherever military and commercial interest met, there was always prime ground for corruption."

The country boys were happy to be working on something of importance for once. Left unsaid by Kodaira and Tachi was that getting people from outside Tokyo was the best way to get politically neutral reinforcement. If the navy got wind of the true purpose of the audit, an anormaly large pile of documents might end at the bottom ot Tokyo Bay.\n\nLittle by little the navy's empire of shipping lanes was carefully being brought to light. Various naval groups moonlighting as escorts for civillian ships, IJN supply vessels tacking on extra goods to their holds on long trip across the Pacific. Former IJN personnel using their experience to launch new shipping companies to work on connecting every corner of the sphere. All of this was well documented, well approved and very legal.

While in practice the IIL appears to be a mere proxy of army and navy interests, its diligent book keeping might be of great use to the investigation.\n\nThe police department was not surprised to see that the organisation's diligence in record keeping did not extend to diligence in cooperating with the police. Rumours of the investigation might have reached the men of the Liaison office. Or perhaps the usual contempt for civilian administration delayed the transfer of documents.\n\nThe reason for the military men's grouchy behavior quickly became apparent when the team began sifting through the documents. The surprising scale of military yen use in supplying and shipping contracts rapidly came to light. In some months, three to five percent of procurement contracts used it. In shipping contracts the proportion reached twenty percent in some time periods.\n\nWhile the currency was legal tender and the army was perfectly in its right to use it, it was truly bizarre to see that much military money sloshing around bank accounts on the home islands. It certainly complicated the payment of contracts, as conversion offices became essential. To the audit team's growing unease, a specific office treated almost all of the conversion to regular money."

 japtouchou.112.d:0 "For what seemed like the first in a long, long time, the Investigation seemed to have a stroke of luck. The representatives of the Yokohama Customs House had initially grumbled when faced with the demands of the Audit team. But after some honeyed words and careful reassurances, they were mostly willing to comply, at least to a degree that Kodaira deemed to be acceptable. Since then, everything had been going mostly to plan, allowing the Investigation and audit teams to speed along in their work.\n\nThe underlying difficulty of the task lay in its size and ever shifting nature. Fortunately, while much of the shipping that the team was specifically concerned with was involved with the Navy, and indeed involved many of their ships, the leadership of the Customs House clearly had no intention of surrendering all control over the associated records. And so, their de-facto administrative monopoly had won them a copy of the files, which suited the Investigation just fine.\n\nFurther difficulty came from the constant movement of Naval shipping vessels between types of assignment. One ship based from a single port could have commercial assignments for half a month, and then suddenly switch to military transport for the rest of the month. But there was one ship that stood out for precisely the opposite reason. It was a ship with only a number, no proper name. And it left from the same port on every single journey, and travelled to the same destination every single journey, a little known Army base near the Manchurian-Korea border."

 japtouchou.113.d:0 "As it would turn out, the jumble of civil and military bureaucracy within the Sphere ports caused a sense of confusion that permeated far deeper into the organizations than appeared at first glance. The two lead detectives and their teams struggled to make sense of the records they were provided. It was not the case that they were illegible or impossible to parse, it was more that it was impossible to assemble any sense of consistency or derive any pattern from the sum total of the records.\n\nThis was doubly concerning given the nature of the organization that stood above it. The Imperial Navy, while renowned for its power and influence, was not known to be a particularly nimble organization, they were slow to implement policy and slower to modify it. They typically made long term, expansive deals with strict contracts, always careful to avoid surrendering too much ground or providing too much interpretive leeway. But the patterns of shipment and movement, of both civil and military wares, did not remotely resemble an organization of that character.\n\nThe quantities and types of items being moved shifted on a bi-monthly or even weekly bases. Military equipment that was originally bound for one location was later redirected to somewhere else. Ships that traveled along fairly regular routes never carried a consistent amount of wares to their locations. Some officers observed that these fluxuations did somewhat align with those in the corresponding product markets. But in order for the Navy to take advantage of such information they would require facilities and departments committed to analyzing the relevant statistics and producing the reports, far beyond the capabilities of the existing departments. And surely the industrial conglomerates would not surrender the information they used to produce their profit margins?"

 japtouchou.114.d:0 "All of the dizzying constellation of organisations and groups tied to the navy in the shipping businesses appeared to be squeaky clean when taken individually. But when examined as a group, weird coincidences began to appear.\n\nThe audit team has built up a dataset of "clean shipping" from the civillian and military world. This data gives the estimated flow of supply to civillian factories, mining operations, forward military and naval bases across the sphere. The navy shipping lanes are now being compared one by one to our collection of 'ordinary' supply runs. Any shipping lane that over delivers supplies, or under delivers, or sees increased traffic can now be picked out from the sea of data.\n\nAlready a set of troubling statistical anomalies has begun cropping up. Some areas are served by three or four different navy organisations, running round the clock shipping operations. It makes little sense to have so many different group working the same area, especially if the navy does shipping for commercial reasons.\n\nAnother problem is that many places with great demand for shipping present little to no civillian activity. Again, the navy wouldn't waste fuel and ships of its commercial fleet just to resupply its own outposts when it already commands a sizeable logistic fleet. The only other potential customers would either be local governments of the sphere, or military bases. The navy is known to sometimes dip into its commercial fleet to ressuply the army, but such a level of commercial ships used in military areas is deeply unusual."

The army, the navy, the seafood plant, the government offices, and now an obscure money changing financial office in the backstreets of Ginza ward.\n\nIt was at least a refreshing change of pace to have some hapless civilians to shout at. Without any army or navy protection, the bean counters at the exchange office were obligated to cooperate fully. The detectives bulldozed through delays and attempts at misdirection to gain the full list of military currency conversion for the last few years. The employees were left dazed in the wake of the police investigation as cartloads of precious 'confidential data' was brought off to the police station.\n\nPreliminary reports did not make it clear why this particular currency exchange was favored. The institution was well regarded, but not the best or biggest in town. The investigation team eventually began to look at the timing of the transactions themselves. A few delays in the currency exchange appeared here and there on the military contract list. By comparing them with arcane reports on the official exchange rate of the military yen, it soon became evident that the conversion to regular yen had always been quite advantageous. The few percents of difference that the office had secured when converting the military contract added up to a quite tidy sum for all the army contractors that agreed to get paid in military money.\n\nEspecially to their shipping partners in the navy."

 japtouchou.116.d:0 "If it hadn't been for Detective Kodaira's time in the Navy, the Investigation might have passed over the glaring evidence that was situated in the tangled mess of military-industrial shipping collusion. Throughout the initial foray the Investigation had made two key observations. First and most generally, the shipping systems the various organizations had conspired to create were inconsistent in their conduct and scheduling, resembling market movements more than the pet project of a militarized bureaucracy. Second, and more subtle, was the existence of a single, unnamed ship which consistently traveled to an obscure military installation near the Korean-Manchurian border.\n\nIt was in the records of this ship that Kodaira noticed the first evidence of the fraud, but after recognizing its implications he soon began to check all the other records for similar evidence, which he found in abundance. What gave it away in the end was the ballast. When a cargo ship needed to load or unload substantial amounts of cargo, they would need to make a corresponding ballast adjustment to keep the ship level and its center of gravity low. This was generally done by flooding deciated ballast chambers in the ship with seawater.\n\nBut in the case of the Navy's shipping, on many, many occasions the ballast adjustment did not match the weight of the cargo they said they were on/offloading. Generally, the ballast adjustment was far greater than should have been necessary for the amount of cargo they were said to be carrying, implying that they were actually hauling more than they claimed. But what was even more alarming, was that this occurred on a number of occasions with ships carrying military equipment."

There is simply too much money floating around these two organizations. Some things remain uncertain, of course. Why would the navy accept to be paid in piles of military yen that ultimately tie them to their hated rivals? And why would the army try to dissimulate their widespread use of the navy's commercial ships?\n\nThe investigation team needed to shift its attention to the army again. The careful public story it had built was beginning to unravel. Hidden in the chain of military procurement contracts was the strong evidence the investigation needed. But what would be its cost?\n\nAt the end of another long day of work detectives Kodaira and Tachi shared a final cigarette before departing home. It had become something of a ritual for the men to share some quiet time at the end of the day to clear their mind. That evening, however, both men could tell the other remained uneasy. The deeper they and their team descended into the abyss, the more endless it became around them. Both men could only hope that they would live to see light on the other side."

We can now inspect what exactly the Army has been receiving.\n\nThere are, of course, a couple of options as to how we can secure the information we need.

The nondescript building is staffed by what would appear to be a completely normal bunch of workers of assorted nationality, and the cargo is perfectly visible. The warehouse functions like a perfectly normal warehouse, just like every other one in the Sphere. The only problem is, well, the paperwork.\n\nOf which there is none. The records of the ships which it services are clean; the office to which Kodaira is redirected turns out to be more of an exercise in imagination than an actual corporate structure. The tidal wave of files, folders and binders which slowly drowns all Japanese offices is simply - not present, not in this case.\n\nTachi is stumped. Kodaira is horrified. The team is shocked into silence. Never, in all their years of life, have they seen such an affront against the ethos of the Japanese company. More importantly, without the accompanying documents as physical proof nothing can be said about the nature of the cargo.\n\nBut after a 20-hour combing of the warehouse, during which several team members collapse, a series of unmarked boxes is found, without even the most basic of identifying marks, invoices or receipts on their body.

The crew of the ship have ample evidence to suggest they are well fed, but what is missing is the requisite cleaning and hygiene material that must accompany food - there is no trace of it in the empty manifests. By Navy and civilian standards this is a violation of regulation, and since the food they eat is traceable to a warehouse near Tokyo it can be claimed that there is due cause.\n\nThe team readies its gear and prepares to strike the ship in dock. Most of the crew will be out on shore leave, and only a skeleton crew, headed by the captain, remains. (Which is suspicious in itself; most captains would happily pass the task to their underlings...) The documents are requisitioned, and a case is drawn up.

Its main office is in the outskirts of Tokyo but its logistics and manufacturing facilities appear to contain far more paperwork than the head office itself; in fact, so much paperwork has accumulated at the isolated facility that the team decide to raid that the office takes several days to unpack and organize. Due to their contacts in the sprawling mess of the military, the workers themselves are left untouched; but as a warning nearly their entire office is cleaned of paperwork with only a perfunctory comment on "bureaucratic standards".\n\nExamination of the paperwork quickly reveals the cause. The product and commerce flows monitored by Fujiwara's main and subsidiary offices appear to be almost entirely separate in volume; just by monitoring the sums of money that are transacted each month, Tachi and Kodaira can tell that something is very, very off in the cash flow statements. The prices offered and paid are simply too high to pay in a sane market, and some of the organisations buying look suspiciously like those owned by Navy veterans. As with so many other organisations involved in the hunt, evidence is spread over a huge scale and so scattered it will take days to reach a tentative conclusion. Efforts to organize the data prove almost entirely futile, as the revenue statements are themselves linked to the diverse sub-offices of the Fujiwara firm and shuffled in ways that would make a professional card player vomit.\n\nHowever, after a member of the team threatens to shoot himself on the spot if the team is not given a break from the number crunch, Kodaira finds the key to this labyrinthine maze of figures.

(The week-long silence from a frustrated Army Logistics Command did not help matters.)\n\nIn fact, the spread of the surplus goods leads to so messy a web of transactions that it looks like a cover-up. Most boxes of goods will come from a common network, linked by maritime route or geographical proximity. The web of goods of this box does not. It is all perfectly random, no rhyme, no reason. Sure evidence of tampering. But the random nature of the goods is also very much anonymous.\n\nAnd then it hits them; the content of the boxes is totally random, but the box itself is not. All the boxes have the same packaging, and the IJA uses local packaging for its shipping requirements. A common source, in an Army warehouse not too far from the warehouse itself.

The one person on board who attempts resistance is the captain; and after a brief scuffle the reason is discovered.\n\nThe captain is uncooperative himself; what is revealing is his quarters. He has a safe in his office; small, black, locked. The appropriate threats of judicial action are used, and the key is requisitioned. And the real itinerary of the ship, the ones containing the anonymous cargo, is found. Of course, withholding inventory manifests from port authorities is not only a serious offence, it is a punishable one by order of the Port Authority, with sanction for an actual legal case conducted all the way in Tokyo. After explaining the technicalities of the situation, the Captain is coerced. Well, he is persuaded. Same difference.\n\nHe points to a nondescript Army warehouse not too far from the harbour itself, and located right on the first stop of the the journey, where the boat is scheduled to perform routine resupply and repair work.

Because none of them tally with the Army records of the transactions of the Company the team prepares in advance. The web described by the Army follows conventional shipping routes with detours at Shanghai and Saigon, the normal route to take, but the routes of the paperwork bounce back and forth across the Sphere, chaotic, random. It strikes Kodaira that the movement of the routes is almost similar to a deck of cards being shuffled by an old hand, back and forth and back and forth...\n\nUpon closer examination two major patterns can be discerned. Firstly, many of the routes approach warehouses or storage facilities managed by the Army or Navy, most of them marked as surplus storage in military directories. Sparsely guarded and even more sparsely manned, without any value to normal shipping, it appears that these offices serve a disturbing secondary function to the maintenance of the routes.\n\nSecondly, and far more importantly, the routes converge, without fail, on an isolated facility near the harbour; a storage warehouse for the Army. Its manifest is easily accessible after a few phone calls to Army Logistics Command, and appears to be perfectly normal. Suspiciously normal. In fact, the irregularities of the manifest are that none of the usual cock-ups of the military logistics chain are even present.\n\nKodaira and Tachi agree: it must be searched.

Tachi flashes his credentials, but the worker does not budge. Annoyed, Tachi goes on a long rant until the worker finally gives in nervously and allows the two detectives to pass. Inside, the two are initially rather curious, then confused, then completely shocked.\n\nThe warehouse is completely empty.\n\nThe two detectives both walk around for a moment in stunned silence, looking for anything at all. Weapons, supplies, the kinds of things that they had been tracking to find this place. They find not a single box of shells in the entire building. They immediately begin pulling aside and questioning the truly minute skeleton crew, who dodge every question and refused to give a straight answer to even the most basic queries. Kodaira eventually demands to see actual documents and records, but is still denied. Tachi goes to investigate the office anyways, but finds nothing. Even after prying open locked cabinets, he finds no records and no real documentation at all. Kodaira and Tachi eventually gather what they can and prepare to head back.

They couldn't be trusted with a gun, let alone the most important raid in the history of the east. A soldier was not the one to get it done either. He'd just follow the orders of the state and kill some civilians along the way. It had to be a detective. Kodaira and Tachi jumped out. Tachi was a spritely, naive Osaka transfer. Certainly quick with a handgun and quick with spirit, but he wasn't experienced with commanding groups and not a cynic like every officer in Tokyo. The boy was used to the small-town Yakuza activities in Osaka and didn't have too much dirt on his hands. Most importantly, he's a meticulously careful planner. Nothing will go unthought or unwritten. Certainly a good choice.\n\nOn the other hand was Kodaira. Old, broken. Cynical. The blood on his hands never dried, and his rage against the corruption of the state, the corruption that had killed so many, never ceased. He was a loose cannon, but perhaps exactly what the raid needed was a loose cannon, hardened by the labyrinthian alleys of Tokyo.

If our raid, a barely condoned secret plan, was to result in the death of an officer or civilian, it would likely mean the end of any real resistance to the conspiracy that has gripped every level of the state. The corruption and the crimes as a result of this corruption would continue unfettered, while law enforcement sits by the wayside. Therefore, death is not an option.\n\nStill, we must bring weapons. If a soldier resists our raid, there is no option but to fire back, if not for our own self-defense. The argument remains as to what weapons to bring; anything too strong will be both cumbersome and conspicuous. Something too small might mean the stopping power won't be able to punch through the plate armor of the soldiers.\n\nA few of the more police-minded, traditional officers suggest simply bringing along standard weapons from the armory like riot shields, pistols, and small submachine guns. These are readily available, and officers are certainly familiar with them. However, they're not designed for use against military units with heavy armor, being used to control civilians and criminals.\n\nA few detectives and specialized officers suggest what they see as an obvious solution; use military-grade weapons against military-grade troops. Semi-automatic rifles are also at the Tokyo armory for use against heavier, well-armed targets. The high caliber would cut through the armor used by soldiers like butter. A couple of issues remain. Bureaucracy would have to wade through to get these weapons, a bureaucracy drowning in corruption. Officers aren't trained in these weapons in the slightest; heavy training will be required, and even with this they won't be as skilled in comparison to earlier weapons."

An armory just in the corner, in the range of the alarm system's trigger - and a section of fence where the weeds grew just tall enough to disguise, if necessary, a human-sized object in the foliage.\n\nThe raid took shape, one action at a time, one manoeuvre after another. Tin soldiers were used for planning, Kodaira and Tachi having both worked the men to physical exhaustion by putting them through drills and pushing them to the psychological brink in endless cycles of paperwork. Thankfully enough, only the two of them were needed for the decision confronting them, and in all probability just one of them could have done the job better. Would the raid use a frontal approach in military action or would it attempt to infiltrate from areas of inactivity and low surveillance?\n\nAuxiliary military police forces could handle themselves best in direct conflict situations, and Kodaira recommended a sharp, short entry into the compound. The schedule would be short and the casualties would be limited. Tachi, on the other hand, advised that an indirect approach would allow for the minimisation of casualties and also allow for more accurate on-the-ground actions. Both were variable degrees of suitable, but only one option could be taken."

Yellow streetlights down the dark and twisting alleys around them flickered until the only source of light came from the weak glow behind the cracked glass windows of the warehouse. He nodded to Detective Tachi and the commanding officer to approve of his readiness and cocked his gun; the raid on the compound suspected of holding incriminating evidence in the IJA investigation was within this building, and his team had the responsibility to gather it safely and securely.\n\nWith martial dexterity and organized speed, the officers descended into the building in the cover of the night, armed in dark black uniforms and with weapons to quieten those who dare violate their deadly veil of silence."

Twinging and with eyes darting from side to side, Tachi continued to flick through anything of use whilst lagging behind the raiding parties, remaining very aware of his surroundings. He was visibly sweaty, with droplets on his forehead and a dry throat.\n\nMoments later, as he continued to follow the officers like a small and timid child trying to prove his resourcefulness, there was an unusual sound from down a dark and damp hallway. Tachi turned his head in an instant, and a deafening silence followed.

The commanding officer nodded at his men and began to count with his fingers in a grim and harrowing silence.\n\nIn a great crash, the officers burst through the door and flooded the room with glaring torches and threatening yells of violence. There was a thick smell of metal and gunpowder, as well as the oily smell of burning papers and plastics. The IJA men in the dim-lit and damp room, caught in the process of incinerating piles of what seemed to be incriminating evidence, instantly darted their heads towards the weak door flying off its hinges and leapt from their seats. With law enforcement charging towards them, they staggered across to the corners of the room to grasp any kind of weapon or sharp object, and as Detective Tachi followed in, he skidded across the floor and frantically dashed to find cover."

The roars of both parties echoed throughout the hallways of the facility, banging about the unpainted plasterboard walls that were once lined with the heavily armored law enforcement agents. As some of the men unsheathed blades, turning them inwards towards their stomachs as they were cramped behind cover, others hid from law enforcement and pressed the barrel of their pistols into their temples in the brief moments they thought they had left.\n\nA worrisome flush washed over Kodiara; every muscle in his body tensed as he heard the wails of the IJA men from behind cover. However, just before his blood could curdle at the sight of the death of these men, it had become clear that the officers had detained and pinned them to the ground before they could so easily welcome their doom. They let out screams of defeat, muffled under the subduing force of the officers before being thrown about as they were escorted from the dingy location of their plotting.\n\nAs the raid came to an end and the teams shuffled out of the building, Kodiara pulled out another cigarette from his pocket and sighed a large breath of the tobacco-rich gas that danced in the air in front of him. He watched the armored trucks ship what remained of the documented evidence away in the misty rain from under the cover of the tin-metal roof. Tachi leaned against the brick wall behind him, similarly exhausted, and basked in the tired silence they now could share."

 japarmyraid.5.t:0 "A Lead Secured"
 japarmyraid.5.d:0 "Detective Tachi sat in at his cheap desk, smoking a cigarette and taking a moment to relax. His body had not quite rested since the intense paranoia and his mind was still running circles around the memories of his frightening experiences in that room. After a deep breath, he sat forward in his chair and began to sift through the documents retrieved in the raid and now spread out across his desk.\n\nSpending hours analyzing printed information on the documents, Tachi had removed his tie and unbuttoned his shirt to cool down his hot and bothered chest, frustrated with the piles of useless numbers and statistics he had to search through to find diamonds in the rough. His mouth was dry from a lack of sleep, and the ring of tinnitus was mind-numbingly foul. However, as the sun began to rise in the morning, Tachi had a moment of realization.\n\nHe scribbled down some notes in a frantic haze, dashing the pen across the empty room once he was finished writing, and darted to collect a handful of relevant papers and his trench coat. Just as the his colleagues were arriving for their shift in the morning, he pranced out of the building and to the legal offices that were managing the case; he had scrounged up the required evidence to incriminate the plotting corruption in the ranks of the IJA."
 japarmyraid.5.a:0 "Eureka!"
 japarmyraid.6.t:0 "The Panic"
 japarmyraid.6.d:0 "It happened almost in slow motion for Detective Kodiara as he dashed into the room the police were raiding. He had skidded on a gasoline spillage on the wet floor, and he was able to survey the room for a slight moment. For a second, their eyes were wide and their bodies sprung into action; like animals in the wild, their reflexes kicked in to save them from their bludgeoning. After that instant, however, a great blaze erupted from the far corner of the room as one of the men kicked over the burning fuel used to incinerate documents, destroying much of the evidence in a hellish inferno.\n\nMr. Kodiara was thrown back by the small blast, and as he gathered his senses among the shouts and cries of the law enforcement agents scuffling around the room, his attention returned to the now armed criminals. They had scurried behind old tattered furniture and debris with handguns and knives, but as Kodiara reached for his pistol he realized what they had planned and he let out a great yell.\n\n"DON'T SHOOT, THEY'RE NOT OUT TO KILL-"\n\nLaw enforcement officers charged past Detective Kodiara with brute force to subdue the men, throwing him to the ground by the stacks of dilapidated furniture. His view was blurry and waning; he was nauseous and dizzy, barely able to make sense of the chaos unfolding around him. He crawled to find cover and could barely breathe, until his vision locked with the lifeless eyes of the IJA troop he had been looking for. A short blade protruded from his stomach; the troop had committed suicide before he could be captured by law enforcement, and he died with the last remaining evidence that could be salvaged from the disaster. Blood trickling through the old wooden floorboards towards Kodiara, he remained still on the ground, dazed and shocked; the other men had died too, taking their lives in similar ways before they could be arrested."

 japarmyraid.7.t:0 "Day of Blood"
 japarmyraid.7.d:0 "The blood-curdling yell of a brave death echoed throughout the warehouse, and then a deep silence fell over the numbingly-alert officers. Detective Tashi gulped; his hands quivered with his pistol shaking about between his fingers as he looked over the bloody conundrum of suicides sprawled across the dark wooden floor. Kodiara climbed up to a stable stance, and his wide eyes scoured the room of the terrific mess of bodies the officers gazed at. No one dared to speak, not even to issue a command to wrap up their operations.\n\nThe sound of crackling fire was broken up by the sudden coughs of Mr. Kodiara, who approached Tashi from behind and patted him on the back as his eyes were fixated on the ghastly horror of their failure. The officers had already left the room, but Tashi's shock had captured him in an immovable and awesome stance. He rubbed his tired eyes and darted his vision towards Kodiara, who nodded and sighed, signalling for them both to leave the room and escape the sight of the grisly remains.\n\nSome time had passed since the final incident, and Kodiara had reached to light another cigarette in the fresh air. Offering Tashi one, he sighed and puffed out a great breath of tobacco-rich smoke, bringing him a slight relief from the bitter awe of their failed incursion. With most of the evidence gone, and the criminals dead, Kodiara stared aimlessly with defeat into the misty rain that glittered in the night sky. He looked back to Tashi, who leaned against the brick wall with wide eyes and was biting his lip; Kodiara scoffed, and took another breath of his cigarette before returning his vision to the thick clouds that lined the sky."

 japnavyraid.1.d:0 "It was nighttime in the particularly quiet parts of Tokyo. The sun had set, and the cover of night ruled over the rumbling city's buzzes and wails in the distance. For once, Kodiara and Tachi could find a peace away from the trauma of such blasting noise, but they were not spared from the baking heat in the dusk's darkness. A riot of temperatures had thickened the air, prickling their skin from under their sweaty white collars and trench coats.\n\nKodiara took a puff of his cigarette, before slinging it down by his side as he gazed over the distant urban center they now overlooked from just outside the warehouse. He could not take his eyes away from the dazzling white lights that flickered so far away as if they were stars twinkling in the city he grew up in. He took another puff of his cigarette and let out a deep breath.\n\n"Kodiara-san. Surely it's too hot for a cigarette now, even at this hour?"\n\nTachi chuckled after he broke the glistening silence, but Kodiara did not respond. Instead, he turned his head and put out the smoke by stamping it into the ground. As law enforcement signaled that the raid in search of the rogue IJN trail was about to commence, he reached for his handgun and held it by his side. Tachi, now with his smirk firmly wiped from his face, followed suit and tailed the detective. The itching air pressed against their skin, growing hotter as they approached the warehouse, and Kodiara let out a groan of impatience before taking another breath - anticipating a great deal of trial to follow him into the gloomy complex."

 japnavyraid.2.t:0 "The Tense Crux"
 japnavyraid.2.d:0 "Kodaira and Taichi entered the building, guns raised, and were greeted by nothing but deathly silence. Flickering bulbs swung overhead, casting dim lighting onto the concrete flooring, tall walls of stacked crates filled the warehouse, and soon, the patter of rain on the roof filled the silence the complex had offered them.\n\n"Find anything? Got nothing on my side." radioed Kodiara to Taichi, the soft static reverberating off the walls.\n\n"No, I haven't found anything yet either." replied Taichi, shining his flashlight on a desk he had stumbled upon, finding nothing but some pen and paper.\n\n"Damn." remarked Kodaira. "These guys really cleared everything out. Bastards must've taken it all and left." he said, perusing through the filing cabinets without success."Wair, Taichi, come here. I found something."\n\nKodaira and Taichi now were staring at a rusted metal door, its window blocked off by wooden planks. Kodaira found its knob unwilling to budge.\n\n"Let me handle this." stated Taichi. A simple kick sent the door flying sideways. Funneling in, the team found themselves in a dark hallway, its air moisty as the floor riddled damp with puddles, as its stench was foul like rotting waste. Then a noise, like rats scampering.\n\nSomething wasn't right.\n\nSomething definitely wasn't right."
 japnavyraid.2.a:0 "Quiet, they're here."
 japnavyraid.3.t:0 "Silence Chews The Vigilant"
 japnavyraid.3.d:0 "The prickle of anticipation shuddered down Kodiara's spine; he was begrudgingly certain that where that small chattering scratch came from was exactly what they had been looking for. He took a deep breath, and reached to his back pocket for another cigarette to ease his blistering mental tension.\n\nThe dark and creaking corridor the team had stuffed themselves in had an air thick with fear, choking their every breath. Taichi made eye contact with Kodiara from behind the group of law enforcement officers; his eyes were jittery and dashing across the room in an intense dread. Kodiara clenched his jaw and pressed his feet into the ground to conceal his own anxieties from his colleagues.\n\nIn the room adjacent to theirs, a small flicker of a flame and low levels of muttering could be heard by the silently attentive team. Whilst law enforcement listened in, Kodiara rested his eyelids and braced himself for the inevitable violence to come. Taichi looked over to him for affirmation, who stood by the shattered window and the peeling wallpaper, before nodding with pursed lips and a sweaty brow. Their lack of words was unsettling, but their body language spoke volumes of the foreboding raid to come.\n\nOn the count of three, the agents broke down the door and wailed arrest orders to the naval officers incriminated in the month-long investigations. Innumerable hours of research, scouring, and chasing dead leads had led the team to this very moment; Kodiara let out another deep sigh before he too charged into the dank retreat."
 japnavyraid.3.a:0 "Brace yourselves!"
 japnavyraid.4.t:0 "In The Nick Of Time"
 japnavyraid.4.d:0 "In the blurred moments Kodiara could make out after law enforcement had charged in, the officers implicated for their crimes had been subdued and constrained on the floor and against the walls of the decrepit hideout. He lowered his handgun as an intense brush of relief washed over him, followed by the unbinding of pressure that had coiled around his old heart.\n\nThe putrid smell of soft, moulded-over wallpaper and furniture had swamped the room in a disguising stench, but at least the criminals had been arrested, Kodiara thought to himself. He coughed up a brief chuckle as he walked through the room, until his eyes passed over the two dead officers shot by law enforcement in their resistance to arrest. Their lifeless eyes had rolled back, leaving a glossy-white hue that reflected the dim and flickering flame from the makeshift incinerator a few steps away. Kodiara scoffed, signalling for some help in clearing up the mess.\n\nTaichi scrambled past the raiding team to peer down the rusted barrel housing the flame; it had already burned many of the documents that the naval officers wanted to get rid of. Taichi choked on his breath, exclaiming "Sir... I think they were trying to cover their tracks before they knew we'd get here," before stepping over to flick through the preserved files left untouched. Kodiara chuckled to himself, turning his eyes back to the subdued officers with a wise and dismissive glare:\n\n"We've got you now, you sly bastards. We have everything we need to have you locked up forever, or worse..."

 japnavyraid.5.d:0 "With the burst of gunfire, small fragments of metal shot across the room in a deadly display of lights that seized the attention of Tachi's eyes. He darted his head downwards and raised his arms in a frustrated haze, shaken by the sudden spurt of metal and gunpowder. The echoes and crackles of the bullets bounced about the room, and in his skull over and over, hammering and grinding at the back of his eyes in a painful awe. Thrown to the ground, Tachi's mouth ran dry as he tried to return his vision to the darkened room around him and make sense of the violent chaos unfurling around him. \n\nThe clatter of metal on metal ached throughout the room, and the wails of the IJN criminals grew louder. Tachi, still immobilized and dazed on the ground, tumbled and dragged himself behind scattered debris. He could barely make out the dark figures dashing between shapes, screaming as they fired bullets and heckled. He gulped again; the stuffy heat strangled him with a thumping headache as he stretched his tense muscles across the floor. \n\nThe roar of gunfire grew louder for a moment, and then ended with a great thump and the giggle of empty shells falling to the ground. Tachi was still shaken by tremors of the encounter, and his heart raced in a moment where he lost control of his breath and his vision."

 japnavyraid.6.t:0 "Sailing Against The Wind"
 japnavyraid.6.d:0 "Tachi blinked his eyes many times over and reached for something to stabilize his position. The buzzing white noise ringing in his ears began to quieten, and the pounding pains in his head had dampened as he caught his breath. He exhaled deeply, and as his body descended into a calmer state Tachi slowly lifted himself from the ground as he reached to pat down the smears of soot on his clothes he had collected from the grimy floorboards. \n\nAfter the wailing crackling of gunfire had ended, Tachi could only hear the shuffling of feet over and across the room in desperate search of remaining criminals or evidence. With great beaming torches and silver alloy guns, the law enforcement officers glided around the room in small groups and yelled for the surrender of any remaining survivors, and they were met with no replies. Kodiara slid into the room soon after and he approached the conflict-shaken detective; they stood stiller than rock as they looked over the dead sprawled across the ground. \n\nTachi, amidst the trauma of bullets zipping over his head, did not notice the brutal mangle of bodies that laid across the floor adjacent to where he was immobilized. His eyes were wide and fixed as he gazed at the corpses chewed up by small arms fire, realizing the horrendous implications of such brutality on the investigations. The stench of gunpowder and blood razed Tachi's nose hairs, but he did not react to the violent aftermath. Rather, the hysterical buzz of shock froze him in place. Kodiara cleared his throat before patting Tachi on the back; he pulled out a pack to offer the detective a cigarette, and did not dare to speak over the deafening silence shared between the two in that moment."

 japgoodaftermath.1.t:0 "A Clean And Quick Affair"
 japgoodaftermath.1.d:0 "The dust had settled, the guard accounted for, the debriefings finished. It had been almost too easy to seize the things they needed; information, the executive management and a wide-reaching warrant for further investigation of the Armed Forces for "suspected treason, illegal trafficking, and conspiracy against the Emperor". An uneasy peace reigned in the meeting room, and Kodaira and Tachi used this peace to plan their next move.\n\nThe two began by thanking the many people who had made this investigation possible, and Kodaira, stuffy as ever, bowed formally in gratitude. Embarrassed laughter rippled in the space of the hall. Moving to a serious note, the two warned the team that the information they currently had indicated possible breaches of trust going all the way to the upper echelons of the Sphere, and that the Government itself was deeply implicit. This meant that keeping the investigation internal would be suicide, both professionally and possibly physically.\n\nBut how would this investigation be kept going without lethal consequences? Tachi introduced the plan to keep the Armed Forces accountable in the public eye: a 4-hour conference with the press of Japan, so wide-scale and exhaustive in details that it would be irrefutable. Only with the truth could the investigation and their own lives be safeguarded.\n\nKodaira ended on a cryptic note, warning them to keep to themselves; no one knew what would happen to the Kokusei when this was finished, but it was unlikely to be pleasant. And as for themselves..."
 japgoodaftermath.1.a:0 "Ominous."
 japgoodaftermath.2.t:0 "Tie Up the Loose Ends"
 japgoodaftermath.2.d:0 "The investigation team's complex of meeting rooms, drawing boards and hallways was a complete mess. Here and there were scribbles and messy diagrams implicating almost every figure in the Imperial government in one way or another. And the paperwork had seemed to come alive in the months since the initial murder; it tumbled merrily down desks and out of cabinets, splayed across rooms without any real sense of order.\n\nAnd the folders marked with "Cause for Concern" or "Needs Urgent Attention" were many, and few were resolved. It was all utterly unacceptable, and more importantly, potentially damaging to the press release. Kodaira and Tachi decided to refocus their efforts on taking care of these loose ends to prevent any damaging information from leaking out and hurting their credibility. (Given what half the papers in Japan were saying, their credibility was already in mortal peril; no further assistance was needed on that score.)\n\nThree main areas were identified for attention: the mountains of paperwork involved in the investigation had to be settled, the accounting of the financial flows between the Army and Navy (at least those that could be tracked) finished with the help of external organizations, and the captives from the Armed Forces interrogated to reveal their dealings. The rest would be minor in comparison.\n\nKodaira and Tachi nodded, scribbled notes on their books, and began to reorganize the complex. Even if the outside world was melting, they could restore order here, and perhaps even ensure their survival beyond that of the immediate future."
 japgoodaftermath.2.a:0 "Oh wow, look at this paperwork I just found!"
 japgoodaftermath.3.t:0 "Settling Accounts"
 japgoodaftermath.3.d:0 "The accounting of the Armed Forces had been limited by two factors: time and exhaustion. The team had suffered from crippling shortages of one and overabundance of the latter, and so examination had been brief and cursory, limited to the biggest single sources of revenue they could track down; even then details had been brief and limited to the strictly functional.\n\nBare-bones examination worked well for presenting a bunch of confused military bureaucrats with evidence they weren't prepared to handle, but it wouldn't fly in the eyes of the press. Drastic improvements would have to be made by the time of the press release; and that day was drawing ever closer. The team pulled their leads from some of the minor accounting firms they had prior experience with, and began work.\n\nIt turned out that the money circulating around the Sphere through this branch of the armed forces had been crafted by a few hands; more promisingly, it appeared to circulate around a few key agencies and departments rather than an endless mess of laundering through the many departments of the Sphere. Even so, there was much to be done, and a simple task was not necessarily a straightforward one.\n\nDuring the briefing, one member of the team voiced his concerns over the sheer amount of documentary evidence flowing through the complex; boxes and boxes of files and documents, all of which could be compromised. Kodaira's face turned black and he left the room, while Tachi voiced the trademark assurances that security was tight as ever. But the truth was that no one truly knew how to safeguard this volume of information. And the time was drawing close when they would have to wield it."
 japgoodaftermath.3.a:0 "Crunch the numbers and we can worry about security later."
 japgoodaftermath.4.t:0 "Interrogate the Captives"
 japgoodaftermath.4.d:0 "The room was small, enclosed, padded just enough for the voices to resound off the walls. Standard Police engineering. And who could forget the classic table and dimly lit lamp? Every cadet was taught that interrogation lay not in words, but in atmosphere, and this atmosphere had been delicately crafted. For the target had information that could save - or doom - the government of Japan.\n\nKodaira looked through the case files; everything seemed to be in order. Most of the captives they'd arrested through the raid had been career bureaucrats fattened off government money. A cozy life in the military with limited training in combat would make them easy targets: a few days in confinement and a silken-gloved approach would scare them just as much as any Yakuza lowlife. Not that the Yakuza ever visited the Police.\n\nHe then leafed through a well-worn copy of the list of Key Performance Indicators the team had outlined. The usual requests were all there: money, transactions, agencies, names, and personal involvement. All informative, all useful, all critically incriminating. And a reminder: if the targets were reminded that they served no purpose except as hostages for the Army and Navy (which was true, but only to an extent) they might prove more willing to negotiate. After all, the easiest way to surrender was through fait accomplis.\n\nThe target entered the room, held on either side by guards. Kodaira brought out his most wolfish smile and began to speak."
 japgoodaftermath.4.a:0 "So, my friend, do you know why you're here?"
 japgoodaftermath.5.t:0 "Clear the Paperwork"
 japgoodaftermath.5.d:0 "After many, many hours of hard work, the papers justifying the investigation and the raid had finally been sorted and categorized. Huge stacks of papers had been moved, no longer lining every wall but instead properly organized and stored. While that may finally have been completed, the security of the papers still remained in question, and many within the department worried that by centralizing and categorizing the papers they had in fact just made it easier for their foes to seize the evidence and end so many months of hard work.\n\nHowever, there was a rumor that Tachi and Kodaira had a plan. Word around the department was that the two detectives, having foreseen the inevitable attempt by enemies to steal the papers, had organized for the documents to be moved and stored in a secure location. However, the two refused to confirm when questioned. Everyone on the investigation team hoped that they did indeed have a plan, because if the papers were lost then all their work would have been for nothing, or even cause more harm than justice."

 japgoodaftermath.6.t:0 "The Footsteps of Giants"
 japgoodaftermath.6.d:0 "The investigation team had gathered once more, called by Tachi and Kodaira. The looks on the faces of the two detectives were grave. They wasted no time as soon as the team was gathered and got right to business. They informed the team that despite their hopes, it seemed that there would be many foes yet to come in their fight for justice. No longer were just the Navy and the Army involved, it now seemed possible that those implicated could run all the way up to the Ino Clique itself. The Audit Bureau and Central Command itself could try to get involved along with the Army and Navy Ministry.\n\nKodaira sighed heavily before continuing. He gave an apology for dragging the entire team into danger, and expressed sincere regret that this could not have ended as simply another murder case. However, there was now a distinct possibility that the jobs, security, and even lives of everyone on the team was now in serious danger. Because of this, two primary actions had to be taken. Firstly, security had to be tightened severely. Contact outside of close, trusted friends and family was to be reported and kept to a minimum. Secondly, a group life insurance policy was being taken out on the team in case any of them did end up losing their lives for justice. Though everyone on the team felt somber, they knew that these measures were necessary. They just wished they weren't."

 japgoodaftermath.7.d:0 "The meeting was brief and rather underblown. The head of the department called up Tachi and Kodaira with a subtle but noticeable note of annoyance in his voice. He tersely congratulated them on their good work and then sent them back without a further word. As soon as the meeting was over, he called them back to speak with them privately. Contradicting his praise from just a few moments ago, he chastised the two. His voice was constantly on the edge of true and furious anger. He exclaimed that the two had gone simply too far in the pursuit of justice and had put not just the department but all of the Police of Japan in a dangerous situation.\n\nHe explained that while the police were furious, public perception and the demand for justice had forced them to take the detectives' side. Preparations were already being made to obtain huge amounts of warrants and the authority to arrest many in high positions of power. The department head shook his head and told the two detectives that if this ended poorly, they were no longer just endangering themselves but in fact almost everyone in the Japanese police. He concluded by saying that he hoped to the heavens that Tachi and Kodaira could handle what was coming."

 japgoodaftermath.8.d:0 "The day was cold and rainy, torrents of sharp droplets barraging the miserable crowd. Nobody really wanted to be there, but they all wanted to know what was happening. They had been waiting for almost an hour, and though they all had a vague and worrying idea of what was to be announced they wanted to know the full extent.\n\nFinally, Tachi and Kodaira made their way to their podiums. Kodaira did the majority of the talking, giving a somber greeting before getting into the actual investigation. He described the initial murder and how the case had slowly escalated the further down they had gone. Eventually, he got to to what would really turn heads. He described their discovery of a vast network of illegal arms dealing and general corruption, centered on the Army and Navy but also reaching into other areas of Japanese government and society.\n\nThe instant those words left his mouth, he was drowned out by shouts and yells from the crowd. The questions of journalists, the gasps of workers, and the anger of Army and Navy servicemen were far too much. A group of soldiers from the Army even attempted to rush the stage in outrage and were only barely stopped by police officers. The two detectives had to be escorted back to safety. They looked at eachother with fear in their eyes. They could no longer have any assurance of their own physical security. It was too late for that."

 japgoodaftermath.9.d:0 "Tachi waited at the complex with his team. It was so silent one could hear a needle drop on the other side of the building. The entire team had become very worried as of late. Their enemies' numbers grew by the day, every morning a new outraged letter from the Kempeitai or threat by the Navy. It had gotten so bad that team members did not just fear for their work, their jobs, or even their freedom, but for their very lives. There seemed to be a very real fear of murderous retribution from those they had brought justice to.\n\nTachi finally decided he needed to do something. He stood up and addressed all the team members present. He said he knew how bad it felt, how scary it was, but that they would be okay. Their foes had no reason to kill them. If anything, if they killed the team they would only be proving their own guilt. However, he also said that revenge often outweighed reason, and to keep alert. The team members should all be on guard, and be ready to move their families to the complex if needed."
 japgoodaftermath.9.a:0 "Would our enemies dare stoop so low?"
 japgoodaftermath.10.t:0 "Calm the Government's Fears"
 japgoodaftermath.10.d:0 "Kodaira sighed. He had been in this meeting for over an hour, enduring hatred, fury, and absolute contempt from those who supposedly had the same ideas and goals as he did. A government where exposing corruption and malpractice got you nothing but spite was not one that Kodaira wanted to serve, but he knew that these were just bad apples in the still-standing and proud tree that was his nation. He assured the politicians time and time again that he was only trying to bring justice and serve Japan, not harm it, but his assurances fell on deaf ears. These people wanted the status quo, even if the status quo was wrong.\n\nThe meeting eventually began to fall apart completely. Kodaira talked less and less, and with shock he noted that the representatives had started to argue with each other as much as they were arguing with him. Soon they seemed to have forgotten him entirely and were biting and yelling at each other with seething rage. Each blamed the branch that some other politician was representing. Kodaira had not realized until now just how deep he and his team had struck at Japan. The branches and fruits were not all that were spoiled. The very roots were rotting away, and if he had not acted and revealed it the whole tree would have collapsed. Even now the whole system seemed on the brink of collapse. Kodaira silently hoped he had done the right thing."

The clock above their heads ticked slowly, each little click a second closer to total chaos. The two detectives had never even guessed what they were getting into all those months ago. Just a standard murder. Just a nobody pawn in the machine. Kodaira remarked that he almost wished that they had never found the greater truth. That they could just have continued as normal. Lived their lives, done their jobs.\n\nAround them, the department was going into full lockdown. All the evidence, captives, and documents were being moved around, shuffled away and hidden in locations undisclosed to even most of the officers. They had reached a point they had prayed would never come. There was a rumor that someone, perhaps the Kempeitai, perhaps the Navy, perhaps even the government itself, was going to attack. Be it to desperately save themselves or simply out of pure revenge, they would have vengeance. The government was in absolute chaos and would likely not protect the department. Who knew how long there might even be a government for. Even if the department survived this attack, there was an even slimmer chance they would make it through the almost certainly upcoming power struggle. All they could do was pray and fight like they had hoped they would never have to."

Not just mourning the casualties, but the implication of the casualties. The raid had failed and the department had lost. Justice would not shine, even though the death of it's forebears. There was little hope at this point. All the detectives could do was try to move on, as hard as it may seem. They would continue the fight, even if it killed them.\n\nThe military officials were doubly excited and terribly disappointed. Sure, they had covered their asses, but at what cost? At what cost to their legacy, at what cost to their troops? Perhaps most importantly, at what cost to their enemies? They had the intention to exploit, but not murder. They weren't looking for a war. They were looking for money, plain and simple.\n\nThe bodies are buried in quiet ceremonies. The reason of death is not given, but a healthy pension is given to the families of the deceased."

Inside was a mess of scattered paper, ashes, and bodies rotting in the humid air. Rodents scrambled about, looking for a cut of the meat.\n\nA few expeditions had been conducted to gain bodies, but nothing more. The bowels of the base still laid untrodden since the siege. They smelled of rotting shit and flesh. The unknown called to no one, and zero volunteered to see what was inside. Eventually, a squirmy officer was pushed in. He emerged stinking with the same stench of those rooms but brought news of what lay inside. The file cabinets were empty, the evidence inside vanished. This would not do. The police could not have gotten ahold of them. They will not."

 japbadaftermath.4.d:0 "The officials were furious. Even though the raid had resolutely failed, the detectives had gotten away with too much. They weren't sure whether the police would even put it all together, but they weren't gambling on it. Action must be taken, and quick. One raid wouldn't set this whole house of cards tumbling down,"

 japbadaftermath.5.t:0 "The Note"
 japbadaftermath.5.d:0 "It was in the early morning that a messenger arrived at the police department. Cloaked in a trenchcoat akin to our own and carrying a pair of small Manchurian binoculars, he brought a small note in a white envelope. As we mourned our fallen, he knocked on the door two times. Certainly, not a good time to arrive, but when is there a good time? Tachi opened the door sulking, with a frown on his face. He gave a nod to the messenger without knowing who he was, took the note, and closed the door. Probably just condolences.\n\nIt was when Tachi slipped open the note that he realized this was much more important-and dangerous-then some simple condolences. In plain text, without a return address or even a name, were those words, typed out.\n\n"The Tokyo Police Department will not spread any information they supposedly gleamed in the raid. Any slander directed toward the Military or other government groups will be severely punished for."\n\nTachi's heart dropped. He thought the issue had been closed. It wasn't as if they had gained much information from the raid in the first place, but now they were being threatened by some mysterious higher-ups? Kodaira would know how to deal with this. He had to. "

First, the biggest event in his career goes terribly sour, and now they're being threatened by the government? It's not like he hadn't ever felt at risk of being put in prison for perceived crimes, but this was certainly the worst situation he had been in so far. And still, he wasn't going to let this get in the way of the investigation; everyone else seemed to think it was over, but it was obvious that the military thought the department had something on them.\n\nThey couldn't stop now. Even if it caused more deaths, he had learned that sometimes, it was all worth it. Besides, there was something out there that they didn't want him to see, and he would try his damn hardest to see it. As Tachi waited eagerly for some kind of answer, Kodaira stood up, grabbed his coat off the wall and his hat off the weathered stand. Tachi followed suit. In a time like this, when the young transfer felt powerless, he tended to simply let the power guide him. Kodaira sighed."

 japbadaftermath.7.d:0 "The train ride back to the base was tense. They didn't have any authority to be there, and they certainly couldn't be certain that they wouldn't be shot on the way. But they reached the base quietly and without being shot, so there was at least a chance they would get out without a bullet in their brains.\n\nRummaging through the scattered paper covering the ground and bodies found among the bullets, Tachi couldn't help but feel sick to the stomach. He had seen bodies before and inspected crime scenes, but this many bodies? Some of his own friends and colleagues? No man could prepare for a moment like this. It was while padding down some soldier's uniform that he felt a slip of paper, no larger than an envelope. Scrawled in rough, rushed handwriting was a phone number and a name, Arai Katsuhito. While he could barely read it, there was at least a bright spot to this horrid day. As the day closed and the duo bagged up the evidence, they could not help but feel as if they were being watched in there every move.\n\nThe train ride back was as tense as the first."

 japbadaftermath.8.d:0 "The stranger peered through his binoculars. They were a dusty affair; some old Manchurian produced ones, dating back to the war. On the cusp of vintage but still in the realm of old and worthless. They wouldn't stand out, considering the small size. Through them, he could see those two detectives who had gotten a little too close to comfort to the whole ordeal. One of them was older. He had stubble and a weathered tan coat. Some wire-frame glasses gave him the look of that Manchurian bastard, Puyi. The other was younger, but not too young. He was dressed a little too sharply to be a veteran in the field. After a couple of hours of silent gathering of evidence, they left without a word, but the stranger swore that one of them noticed him, standing in the silence. He slunk away.\n\nTachi and Kodaira returned marginally less distraught then they had been in the morning. Ignoring the sick feeling in Tachi's stomach, they had a promising lead, and nobody from the military had been bothering them. That was until another knock arrived on the door. When they opened it, nothing awaited them but a small letter at the ground in front of the raised doorway. Again, in clear typed script, it read,"

They had assigned him to a middle-class neighborhood rarely had any crimes; the worst on a daily basis was a child receiving a slap on the wrist for shoplifting. But the peaceful nature of the area belied the turbulent mind of Morikawa. By his own account, he had not slept for two days, as each time he closed his eyes he saw the faces of his comrade-in-arms, screaming in pain and terror. There was no end to the torture, and worse, the survivor's guilt. His wife was distraught and left to go live with her parents until Morikawa "got his act together." His kids had left with her. Nothing seemed to be going well.\n\nAt least the department had given him a break, even if they could hardly afford it in this time. Something would eventually go well. The nightmares must recede and he would get a good night of sleep. Something had to give. He had to believe something had to give. Out of the corner of his eye, Morikawa saw stranger carrying a pair of inconspicuous binoculars. The man pulled out a pistol.\n\nMorikawa was shot three times between the eyes."

 japbadaftermath.10.t:0 "News from Tokyo"
 japbadaftermath.10.d:0 "Everybody was in shock, including Tachi and Kodaira. On every radio and television in Mainland Japan, dozens of politicians, from local mayors and council members to cabinet members, announced their resignation at once. The reasons varied; some declared that they had grown to old and were ready to retire. Some announced that personal matters had compelled them to leave their posts. But Japan was stunned; there was no good reason a third of the Japanese bureaucracy would leave in a matter of days. It must be connected to the note the two detectives had recieved. Big things were shifting outside of their control. If they couldn't control it, they sure would witness it.\n\nThe two detectives had a great weight on them. They had considered stopping it all since the death, but they couldn't. They were too far in, and it seemed as if their actions had been doing something massive. Now, they just had to follow their lead and not back down. If they did, they could simply be met with another lawless murder."

 japbadaftermath.11.d:0 "Katsuhito wasn't far. Apparently, the man who they had found in the slip of paper lived in a back alley on the bad side of town. The duo made their way, talking under their breaths about who Arai could be. A rat scurried, brushing against their foot, and Tachi swore he heard a scream from somewhere up above. This was not a neighborhood to stay in for long. The door was caged and built into the wall. In the thin alleyway, it scraped against the opposite side of the alley when opened. The two entered without knocking and pulled out their flashlights. Following the address on the slip of paper, they slinked up the stairs until they reached the apartment number. The door was unlocked and the two inspected the dark apartment until they froze. There was a man sitting in the chair. Snoring, by the looks of it. In his lap was a pair of binoculars and to the side of the chair a gun. Shaken awake by the sound of the detective's shoes, he looked up and his face deflated. "Well, you finally found me? I knew you two were good detectives.", he mumbled. Tachi struggled for words, but Kodaira spoke up. "Were you the one who killed Morikawa?" he stated, in a simple, resolute tone.\n\n"I would say that you two killed Morikawa. I would still suggest you halt whatever you're trying to reveal." "

 japbadaftermath.12.d:0 "A string of expletives emerged from Tachi's agape mouth. This was not what was supposed to happen. They were supposed to meet with Arai and discuss with him what was happening, not having him shoot himself the moment they met him. Now there were people walking over to see what the ruckus was. Kodaira went over to the door to explain that there was an issue with the water heater. Tachi went over to look at the stranger's body. On the wall behind the chair was a board with dozens of notes and clippings. Upon closer inspection, each revealed a loose relationship with one another. A few were on bank proceedings in Shenyang. One was a transcript of a Zaibatsu correspondences in Indonesia. Another was of Japanese interests in Chinese resource extraction mergers. A sheaf of paper described smuggling cash and arms to warlords operating in Eastern Russia. Still, more were on affairs in Japan: allegations of corruption quickly silenced by authority. Under the table agreements between important military heads. A number of them were stamped with the numbers 731. Here, on this wall, was the makings of a grand political conspiracy. Silenced by the sheer amount of information before him, Tachi called for Kodaira. When Kodaira spotted the wall, with every piece of evidence needed to indict every man in Japan, enough to indict the empire, he let out his typical sigh."

 japraidideas.1.d:0 "Tachi and Kodaira eventually return with what they have found, plunging the entire investigation team into complete and utter shock. This has just become much bigger than they really ever wanted, and they have crossed the regular threshold of risk to a point where their safety may be compromised. There are clearly very important and very high-ranking people who would be willing to take very drastic measures to keep this quiet, whatever "this" really is.\n\nThe debate soon proves to be extremely divisive. Many become extremely worried about whether they might be in too deep and if it might just be best to drop the whole thing. Others insist that the only way to ensure their own safety is to continue pressing harder. Every moment that this loose end stays untied, they become more at risk of retaliation from those that are being investigated. The only sure way to both be safe and make sure that justice is served is to strike first.\n\nThe debate carries on for hours as the investigators pore over the information, reading and re-reading every line, combing over everything they have gathered as of yet to try and glean some clue as to what they must do next. Eventually, however, one conclusion is reached. Something has to be done. This case cannot go cold. The only thing is to figure out what exactly to do."
 japraidideas.1.a:0 "We are treading in dangerous territory."
 japraidideas.2.t:0 "Too Crazy to Work?"
 japraidideas.2.d:0 "After hours of debate and scheming, Tachi finally speaks up with a truly insane idea. This is clearly much deeper than anticipated. The military is involved somehow. If they do not act soon, they could be in the sights of some very powerful and very dangerous people. Thus, the only course of action is to strike fast and more importantly strike hard. If the suspects will not cooperate, which they have shown they have no plans to do, then the investigators will have to get the smoking gun themselves. A vulnerable military base, one assigned to the unit which the warehouse supposedly belonged to. A quick raid: in and out, and the criminals exposed before they can so much as file a complaint.\n\nKodaira listens thoughtfully, and though many are wary of the plan he speaks in favor of it at the end. He talks about the contacts he has made over the years, people who could get the men and supplies necessary for such an ambitious operation. People who have dealt with unsavory and dangerous things before. Kodaira is, after all, one of the most seasoned members of the team.\n\nTachi thanks Kodaira, but insists he knows his own plan and the people he wants to carry it out. He is young, fresh, the wildcard. The people he might know are stranger, more on the fringe, and perhaps more unique and more unexpected both to the team and to their foes. His ideas are innovative but untested. The team is wary, but many think his tenacity will bring them to victory. Eventually it is brought to a vote."

Tachi accepts this judgement with only a little argument, and Kodaira thanks the team and promises not to let them down. He quickly heads to his office and begins rooting through his files to find names and numbers. After a good search, he starts to make some calls.\n\nHe skips formalities and makes it clear that this is a dire situation and he cannot disclose too much. His contacts understand. This is not the first time they have had to exercise discretion, though they note that Kodaira is more grim and urgent than he ever has been before. They direct him to names, who direct him to other names, who give him numbers, who give him info. He eventually gets a few key names, numbers, and addresses, and heads out.\n\nHe finds two potential allies that interest him most. The first are a few policemen in the Tokyo Police Department who are personal friends of Kodaira. Though he suspects the conspiracy may even reach as the police department, he would and has trusted these friends with his life, and they can gather the non-corrupted and loyal officers of the department. The other contact is riskier, but perhaps more rewarding. He has managed to gather a short list of discontent and slightly hot-headed officers who would do much for a chance for advancement. They could use their involvement against this conspiracy as a chance to take the places of any higher-ranking officers that lose their positions."

 japraidideas.4.d:0 "The young transfer from Osaka, detective Tachi, would lead the charge to find inital allies against the navy or army.\n\nA bold first idea was simply to ask the navy to help the Tokyo police fight the navy. Hidden in the maze of audits and circumstantial evidence was the simple fact that there didn't seem to be enough money to go around. There had been winners in the navy's shipping sector; there had been losers. By seeking the help of greedy navy men that had been left out of the lucrative army-navy contracts, the police department could begin building a coalition. Once the raid came to public attention, perhaps enough of the ambitious navy men would try to sell out their navy rivals to defend the police's efforts. And if the army was targeted, well, Tachi hoped that the navy men not in bed with the army would jump at the chance to upstage their land rivals.\n\nOf course, the safer option was just to find more reliable police officers. Tachi had a lot of friends in the Osaaka and Kobe police departments. Some of west Japan's police higher ups might be able to swing local politician the way of the Tokyo police's investigation. Of course the army and navy's reach extended all over the home islands, but Detective Tachi was ready to bet that this particular conspiracy wouldn't leave the army and navy barracks of Tokyo."

The vagueness of his offer certainly drove away a great many contacts. But a few stayed on to listen.\n\nDetective and officers played chess, Kodaira doing his best not to reveal what all this was about as his army interlocutors hinted that they potentially knew where Kodaira was getting at. Eventually the detective's shortlist had gone done to two candidates. A young man, fresh from his service in Indonesia and frustrated by the ineptness of the Indonesian garrison. And a veteran of the manchurian army, who likely suspected his fellow officers had been skimming off a little too much from the top. "What the hell Kodaira, an old geezer like me hasn't gone much to worry about, right?"\n\nAnd so young and old man had promised to seek out like minded officers in the rank. Having some military men around to defend them would help shield the Tokyo police from most retalation, wouldn't it?"

The civilian police's ability to get crimes solved without the endless internal politics of the various military polices was also in a league of its own.\n\nMaking use of this influence to cover the investigation would however be quite tricky. There was no way to tell just how deep the tendrils of the navy and army reached inside the department. But the investigation units also had its own allies. The gravity of the unfolding conspiracy would also help convince more conservative members of the police department to throw their weight behind the idea of an evidence collecting raid. And so the investigation team worked, filtering every police officer into "reliable" and "unreliable" groups. When the time came to show cards, a surprising proportion of the Tokyo Police Department were forecast to stand behind the investigation team."

Soon the topic came to the difficulty to find purpose now that the Japanese navy was the strongest in the world. No, the young detective had never heard of such dreadful things as navy officers whoring out the proud Japanese navy as commercial freighter. But now that the honorable officer had mentioned it, the young detective had been investigating untidiness amongst the ranks of the navy and army. Were trouble to arise, it warmed the young detective's heart to know that proud men still toiled to maintain the navy's honor and reputation. The navy officer nodded to this, and pledged to support the Tokyo Police Department in its endeavour to root out corruption.\n\nSo went several of Detective Tachi's afternoon for the week. Not every navy man was as delicate and diplomatic as the tea ceremony enthusiast. Many simply wanted a slice of the pie when potential rivals were canned. The young detective never explicitly discussed the army-navy underground shipping contracts, but his interlocutors seemed heartned to know that the upper rungs of the Navy were expected to be hit by the police quite soon. In return these ambitious men would protect the Police from any backlash."

As soon as they explained the planned raid, their boss immediately began tearing into it. He was extremely skeptical that it could work at all, and worried about how terrible the repercussions could be if it did fail. He was a man who played by the rules, and the rules were not terribly well defined here.\n\nThe discussion was on the brink of becoming a full-blown argument, but through deft teamwork and excellent planning Kodaira and Tachi were able to hold their ground without pushing too hard. They explained every aspect of their plan and how it would be executed, and any concerns their boss might have were quickly eased. It was not short or easy, but after a long session their boss was finally convinced. The raid would happen.\n\nThere was one catch. The boss was not convinced that the team had all the people needed to properly carry out the raid with the needed precision and ambition. He ordered the two detectives to gather more allies, people with real power and experience. He suggested less savory organizations that felt cheated by the competition from the government, or politicians who could use their clout to support the investigators and hurt their rivals.

He had a rather large file on the subject, and rifling around through it he already was finding some very promising leads. He picked up the phone and started making some calls as soon as he had the right info gathered.\n\nThe talks were somewhat covert, with every word having to take on a double meaning so neither side could be incriminated, but after a while Tachi was making progress. One particular minister had been feuding with a high-ranking admiral for a few months and was looking for any chance to shame him. That admiral just so happened to be closely involved with this case, and so it was essentially a done deal as soon as his name was brought up.

He could only hope that this would end well, as even the most civilized of the Yakuza gangs were not particularly notorious for being friendly.\n\nAfter making a quick call, he headed off into the city to meet with the man he had contacted. Kodaira ducked under an archway into a little restaurant. There he saw the old man, one he had worked with before. A Yakuza boss, not a particularly noteworthy one but the only one Kodaira would even think of working with. They exchanged the standard pleasantries and spoke largely in veiled sentences, but the negotiation was productive. The boss was angry at the competition to his business posed by the very government, and he was very willing to work with Kodaira and the team to take them down.

Thus, this operation must be planned down to the millisecond; every step mapped out, every factor brought into the equation.\n\nThere remains, however, one titanic decision: to raid the army, or to raid the navy. It seems that for this particular unsavory endeavor the two have put aside their differences for mutual gain, but their general separation and traditional rivalry means that only one can be focused on.

 japarmybrief.1.d:0 "In the end, it came down to a simple choice; follow the boats, or the guns they shipped? The Army had a long and storied history of defying orders all the way up to the Emperor himself, and an equally storied history of denying it had ever crossed the line. To top it off, the equipment volumes per shipment that the team estimated were necessary for the warehouse to be emptied in a shipping run were phenomenally large. Stupidly large. The entity running this series of shipments was totally unconcerned with appearances, or so it seemed.\n\nKodaira emphasised the fact that it would be easy to track the physical shipments, far more so than tracing the elaborate dance of the numbers that was the Navy financial scheme. Guns and equipment could be handled, they could be tracked, and they could be traced. All that would have to be done was the drop of a sample into the black pool of the market, a trace bug here or there, and the Army would drop piece by piece into their laps.\n\nTachi was more than a little uncomfortable at becoming a gun runner; he'd seen what happened to smugglers in his early days, during the war. But if it was for the good of Japan, nothing could be withheld. He agreed.\n\nMeetings were scheduled. Weapons were bugged. Members were briefed. The Team began to move."

At a 15 percent revenue cut? It seemed like the Tokyo Metropolitan Police were out to burn away their annual budget; one contact even went so far as to advise Kodaira, over a drink, to "calm down and think about their finances" before committing. It took a series of further drinks, and a casual palming of financial grease, to assuage his fears.\n\nThe team worked overtime behind the scenes to get the "modifications" to the guns working. Augmented sights, new chambers, new magazines; with all the flashy new additions, who'd notice the slightly heavier weights or the slightly hollow sound they made as they reloaded? Hopefully the Army would be too deep in its cups to notice. And it wasn't like more than a fraction of them did more than basic weapon cleaning, if the stories were to be believed.\n\nSlowly the scheme began to come together. The policemen donned anonymous black suits, prepared their assets, and waited for the biggest fish to snatch the bait. Based on prior activity, they wouldn't be waiting for very long."

This meant comprehensive surveillance of meeting locations, preparations of equipment and obsessive arrangement of schedules to fit the timings just right.\n\nThe team struggled to keep itself together in the face of increasing demands for surveillance in this fashion; one nearly snapped after hearing his series of wiretaps lead instead to the neighbouring hotel room and its...indiscretions. But room by room, bug by bug, the sheer scale of the task began to shrink to organize streams of information. And the team had increasingly settled down to its new task: listening, and watching.\n\nNow the storehouse doors opened, and 17 separate cameras and audio bugs chittered with activity.

These were the assets he had called upon to assist him, along with others in the Army who felt ambitious enough to hitch their wagon to the investigation; and now he had another task for them.\n\nCalling them together in a bar where the secrets piled as high as the cigar smoke, he briefed them on what the next step would be. Interference was a familiar term to most of them, but this interference would be on an unprecedented scale - and all of it would center on the large shipment of weaponry the Police were now shipping to the Army. Internal security, counter surveillance and protective measures: what was left of these protocols would vanish like morning dew, and the mid-level operatives surrounding Kodaira would be the cause.\n\nIt was a simple job, and it could be done with bags of cash to the appropriate agencies as "goodwill" gifts, but men on the ground were far more reliable. After all, the Army's inter branch rivalry and sprawling organisational mess already resembled a minor civil war; all it would take was a little interference here and there for caution to break down.

It was how business worked, after all.\n\nAnd behind the closed doors of the surveillance rooms and the meeting rooms, a web grew to encompass Army ministries both small and large; logistics, intelligence, literally half the Infantry units in the Sphere, the Air Force. Most of these agencies had attempted to use counter-espionage to cloak their activities, as per protocol, but the Trojan assets, as Tachi had taken to calling them, had neutered the efforts. The doors, for all intents and purposes, were wide open, and everything - and everyone - could be seen.\n\nSome links on the web and the cluttered board were thicker than most. But by far the largest individual connections were linked to an agency whose identity continued to elude the team. Until one offer, written in hastily scribbled handwriting, came up with an exact match for font and writing style; a senior officer in the Kempeitai, their biggest internal security competitor.\n\nKodaira and Tachi looked at each other, and laughter echoed down the halls. After all the efforts taken to secure their target, it appeared the end of this investigation would be an internal affair. A very internal affair."

 japarmybrief.6.t:0 "Note the Bankers"
 japarmybrief.6.d:0 "Tachi and Kodaira continued to pore over all the documents. They had the major points now, but it was time to start taking down all the names, not just the big ones. They needed to make sure that nobody would escape once the music played. The focus would obviously be on the generals, the politicians, the big scandalous names, but one group that really needed to be brought down a notch was the bankers.\n\nA few major names in the Japanese financial sector were showing up a lot more than they should. A quick bit of digging and cross-referencing showed their role in the scheme: routing and distributing the money through enough accounts and intermediaries so that it would not be noticed. They would guide the money down a complex path, dodging and darting through the trickling brooks and raging rivers of the financial sector before finally coming to rest in the bank accounts of the higher-ups in the scheme. The bankers would of course skim a little bit off for themselves in exchange for their efforts and their discretion.\n\nTachi and Kodaira took down names and made note of the most egregious offenders. They were clueless for now, upstanding members of society. For the time being, the detectives would smile and act as if nothing was wrong. Retribution would come for these criminals."
 japarmybrief.6.a:0 "There are many layers to this crime."
 japarmybrief.7.t:0 "Prep the Papers"
 japarmybrief.7.d:0 "There was no doubt at all that trying to take down the department's biggest competitor would raise suspicions in the government. It could easily be seen as a hit job, a move to usurp power rather than a legitimate operation. The detectives had to do everything they could to ensure that did not happen. They could not afford to lose anything here. They were treading on thin ice, they had to make sure their legitimacy was unquestionable and their motives completely publicly pure.\n\nThere are so many papers and documents that it would take a normal team months to fully abridge and comb through them, but Tachi and Kodaira had already done more than a normal team could ever do. They had found several highlights that would hopefully make a bulletproof case against the Kempeitai. The weapons trade alone should have been enough to convince everyone that something fishy was going on, but these were not normal times. The two detectives had to reinforce their case with another major point: the money. It always seems to come back to the money in crime. The cash that has suspiciously been making its way in and out of the Kempeitai was not normal in any way, and would be absolutely damning once properly documented and backed up. Tachi and Kodaira began assembling files containing all the evidence that could ever be needed. This would be a hard fight."
 japarmybrief.7.a:0 "Good work."
 japarmybrief.8.t:0 "Hush the Officers"
 japarmybrief.8.d:0 "Kodaira had a very hard task. The Tokyo Police Department had been rather inappropriately close with the Kempeitai for decades now, a result of bureaucratic failures and an unfortunate ability by either side to properly do their jobs without support. This relationship was deep, and it meant that many if not most in the department would not be happy with any action that could damage that relationship. Kodaira had the unfortunate job of finding the right allies within the department and making sure that all worries were kept at bay, even if those worries were completely justified.\n\nKodaira spoke to several colleagues, each time assuring them that this was simply routine and there was no need for any worry. He made sure that everything he said would still sound fine once it was inevitably relayed to the Kempeitai by some loyal croney in the department. They were in many ways the real audience of his talks, and as such they were perfectly tailored to make the Kempeitai as unsuspecting as possible and the raid as viable as it could be.\n\nKodaira had to admit, he felt like he had done a pretty good job. Seeding a lie with the intention that it would be carried to another party was a skill that few could master, but he was no stranger to it. By the end, he was cautiously optimistic that he had bought enough time for everything to be properly done."

 japarmybrief.9.t:0 "We Can Still Hear You Sayin'"
 japarmybrief.9.d:0 "Tachi pored over yet another paper. He had hardly slept for weeks at this point, catching a few hours here and there and missing important things when he did. They were too far in. At this point he could not afford to miss anything, and he could not afford to be as tired as he was. The eternal paradox of a detective. As his tired eyes tore apart each line, searching for anything of note, he noticed a name. It seemed familiar. Reading further, he realized it was a major general, bigger than anyone else implicated so far. He had seen his name in the paper earlier for getting some medal. He quickly made a note of it and realized with dread how big this case was growing.\n\nOver the next few days, big names like that started popping up more and more often. Evidence continued to flow in nonstop, and Kodaira and Tachi kept finding truly major figures in places they had no right to be. This was getting bigger than either of them could have ever thought. Their shock and worry grew as even bigger names started to show up, something they thought impossible. People at the very center of government, high-ranking politicians in the Diet. People who could potentially be Prime Minister some day. People with more power than most could dream of. The two detectives had a distinct feeling that they were punching up."
 japarmybrief.9.a:0 "This is worse than we could have ever imagined."
 japarmybrief.10.t:0 "You Would Never Break the Chain"
 japarmybrief.10.d:0 "The names just kept coming. The list kept growing every day, and it was starting to look less like a chain and more like a massive web of generals, politicians, officers, and now to top it all off admirals. As the evidence continued to flow, it started to become clear that this was not just an army operation. The navy was apparently willing to put its differences with the ground forces aside in the name of mutual profit, the eternal motivator. The entire military was compromised, it seemed, and a good chunk of the government to go along with it.\n\nTachi and Kodaira had gone from worried to completely panicked. Now they were dealing with not one but two different branches of the military police who would absolutely annihilate them if they found out what the two detectives were doing. They realized that they had to act far faster than they had thought before. Each minute that ticked by, their enemies got closer to finding out what they were planning. Each day was another chance that agents of the army, navy, or government itself would bust through their door and arrest them both, or worse. There was not much time left. The raid had to happen as soon as humanly possible."

 japnavybrief.1.t:0 "The Navy HQ"
 japnavybrief.1.d:0 "It seemed like the obvious choice, and Tachi saw no point in moving away from the path of least resistance. After a closed-door debate with Kodaira (and a search for bugs and surveillance equipment immediately before said debate) the Navy was deemed as the branch of the Armed Forces more liable for investigation.\n\nKodaira laid out his old arguments: the Navy wasn't the owner of the goods in the first place, and as shipment movers they simply couldn't provide details as to the whereabouts of the missing equipment. Tachi pointed out that the Navy might not have details on it, but the hundred little sub-companies hitched onto its back had more than sufficient details on the matter to justify a raid; and where the Navy ended and these sub-companies began was anyone's guess. The cash flows of these companies, surely critical to any analysis of the Navy, would also be invaluable, and should therefore be captured sooner.\n\nIn any case, the Navy's involvement with the investigation had become so deep-rooted that it would almost be a relief to move from the subtle passive-aggressive dances of bureaucratic hand-wringing to outright antagonism. On this Kodaira was silent; he had been on the receiving end of too many "chidings" from the Navy Ministry to disagree.\n\nThe debate was settled. The gears of the team began to move."
 japnavybrief.1.a:0 "Let us begin proceedings, then."
 japnavybrief.2.t:0 "Finding A Branch"
 japnavybrief.2.d:0 "In the end it was the paperwork that did the Yokosuka Naval Logistics and Supply Base in. That was its formal name, anyway; most just called it Yokosuka. It had been relatively undeveloped following the War, with official funds flowing to centres connected to the arteries of the Sphere, places like Syonan and Jakarta. Although funds had dried up, other sources of revenue and supplies had replaced them. Very...interesting sources. And the amount of paperwork done to justify this diversification? Even more interesting.\n\nIn fact, the most interesting part of this was that the paperwork itself appeared to fit a base far larger than the Yokosuka base; analyses created an image of a sprawling centre of military activity, with complex logistics and supply chains. This activity was totally absent from the payrolls, the records at Central HQ, and the public eye. But it was there. The question was: to what end?\n\nSubsidiary factors only improved the suitability of the base. The unguarded paperwork trail that had attracted the team to the base meant that the base was run by management either blinded by their greed or brainless in their actions. Not that Navy men couldn't be both.\n\nTo ensure the smoothest possible course of entry, the team spent a week creating a foolproof alibi; they became members of the local branch of Kotachi United Shipping Supplies, a company run from faraway Sapporo by the Kotachi brothers, Navy veterans with an impeccable record. This record was also entirely fictional, but who'd notice? It was a world of shadows, and the team knew that the best plans always came to fruition in the dark.\n\nSources were traced, money changed hands, meetings were arranged. The game was on."
 japnavybrief.2.a:0 "Let us lay the traps"
 japnavybrief.3.t:0 "Draw On Our Friends"
 japnavybrief.3.d:0 "Tachi was a card-player in his youth, like most disillusioned youth entering the Japanese education system; he knew that the best games were with anonymous players, for no one could rig a round played with strangers. But the games where you wanted to win? You made sure half the board was in your pockets before the first card was dealt. And so Tachi prepared a very different board for the highest-stakes game he had ever played; and he knew he had to win.\n\nThe players had met before, of course, in tracing the anomalies that had led to the Navy branch in the first place; and there were psychological chunks in their armor he could use. Wounded pride was a potent substance, and Tachi manipulated it with surgical precision, saying without ever using words that the Yokosuka folks had simply not given the dues necessary to veterans such as themselves. A missed opportunity here, a broken deal there; surely it added up to...\n\nThen he offered, in deepest sincerity, a solution; if information were to pass hands, say, regarding a certain period of transactions and of supply runs, and even of what they knew of the branch's dealings itself, business that was messy but necessary could take place, and the obstacles to a deeper and lucrative partnership could be...removed. With Kotachi United in lockstep, of course.\n\nAnd they took the bait, all of them. One even offered to use his own contacts to create incongruities in the branch's supply routes for the next month, to demonstrate his own willingness. Tachi almost felt sorry for them, watching them draw up the plans for their demise.\n\nAlmost."
 japnavybrief.3.a:0 "Well, our men are in."
 japnavybrief.4.t:0 "Money Talks"
 japnavybrief.4.d:0 "Kodaira had spent a week poring over the necessary documents; his eyes were aching and his five o'clock shadow was beginning its relapse into full-grown neckbeard, but he had, at last, a picture of the single most glaring issue with the cash flows of the Yokosuka Base. It stood out as a series of glaring red figures, a sea in a paper full of puddles. Whoever was handling this issue was even worse at covering his tracks than the rest of the base, which was certainly saying something.\n\nIt even had a name attached to it; the Internal Logistics Department. How quaint. And ironic. In any case, the department head was likely to be foolish enough to accept something at face value; and in a "friendship establishment meeting" held in a secluded bar, Kodaira began offering mountains of somethings. He hinted at the riches his company had to offer, its links to the lucrative Hawaii pineapple trade route and the positive consequences of cooperation. And implied airily that if certain...procedures were to be identified and disposed of, that cooperation could be made very much more lucrative. But only if they were disposed of.\n\nLike a pig to the feeding trough, the head got his face in the metaphorical dirt. Taking his money with a grin, the head agreed to a series of steps that essentially amounted to blowing up the finances of the base. The pieces would fall just where they needed; at the feet of the investigators.\n\nKodaira smiled. It was the easiest hunt he'd ever had. And the prey was offering its neck in friendship."

 japnavybrief.5.t:0 "Go Through the Paperwork"
 japnavybrief.5.d:0 "The initial glance through the nearly countless gathered documents had already revealed a few notable discrepancies and oddities, enough to justify the raid to the team, but they had to go deeper. They needed to justify the raid to the angry higher-ups who would no doubt storm into their place of work and demand all their evidence. They needed to justify the raid to the very people they were targeting, who would no doubt try to squirm and lie and weasel their way out even if they were captured and brought to trial. Every missing cent had to be documented. Every bullet shell out of place had to be recorded.\n\nThe more bureaucratic of the team members spent sleepless days and nights comparing mundane figures and seeking even the smallest discrepancy. The work was both boring and brutal, and to a normal man it could well be called torture. However, eventually, the documents had been picked apart to less than atoms, and every man on the team had to consider himself impressed at what had been found. The stack of papers documenting all the potential discrepancies and peculiarities was nearly as tall as the original stack of paperwork that was being questioned. The baggy-eyed readers presented their work with pride. They had recorded all issues, their causes, possible explanations and the debunking of those explanations, and everything else that one could possibly need."

 japnavybrief.6.t:0 "Seduce Them With Promises"
 japnavybrief.6.d:0 "The best target is one that embraces you as you hold the knife over its back. The most effective way to erase suspicion is through amity, and that is what has been offered. The investigation team has already organized a number of assets within the branch, and now all that needs to be done is to show them that the offer of cooperation truly is genuine, even if it is not. A group so clearly corrupt and greedy as this will respond best to the most classic and simple of bribes: softly rustling bushels of Yen bills.\n\nThe first installment has been sent, promised to be one of many in a long and profitable relationship. Of course, this is a blatant lie, but a lie accompanied by cash is sweeter to the ear and harder to dispute. This influx of cash into their bank accounts will give the raid team the time needed to finalize and carry out all the planned disruptions into the supply chain, and with any luck the unsuspecting targets will be too blinded by their bribe to suspect their new and generous benefactors."

 japnavybrief.7.d:0 "The meeting was tense throughout. The branch representative had clearly dealt with corporate threats and foes before. However, he still did not suspect that the man he was meeting with was in fact no corporate representative at all but instead a member of the investigative team whose only goal was to take the whole branch down. Perhaps that showed that he was not as sly as he thought. The so-called corporate representative continued to drop vague hints and subtle nods towards threatening ideas, unspecific enough to be clearly non-binding but real enough to force the other end to cooperate.\n\nAt first the verbal spar was an even fight, each side prepared with smart and powerful arguments and half-threats. However, as it went on, the undercover investigator clearly gained the upper hand. If skill is even, then he with the higher-quality weapons shall prevail, and one side had much better weapons indeed. He dropped clues towards the oddities and irregularities that had just so coincidentally been found, and where those irregularities might be reported to if things did not end well. He held the promise of funding high over the head of the foe, showing him that thing that he could not afford to lose. Eventually the other side crumbled, and the deal was ensured. The target was exposed."
 japnavybrief.7.a:0 "A genius negotiation."
 japnavybrief.8.t:0 "They'll Never See Us Coming"
 japnavybrief.8.d:0 "The investigation team gathered yet again. Every member had bags under their eyes and looked weary from weeks of work. They were in the final stretches, they hoped. They knew their plan had to work. There was no other option. If it did not, all of their lives were over. They could all go to prison or far worse. They would win because they would not be able to live their lives if they lost. They went over their assets and plan again. One could never be too thorough with the stakes this high.\n\nThe Navy has demonstrated thoroughly that they think their newfound business partners are just that and only that. They have given no sign that they suspect anything, and for all intents and purposes they can be treated as oblivious. Because they see it as just another company, even if they sense a threat they can only imagine it is the same threat posed by any other company, which is to say a small one that they can silence or deal with. Even if they get suspicious they will not be even remotely prepared for the attack headed their way.\n\nMost importantly, their paperwork is so dirty and so ineptly kept that it reaches an almost comedic point. Even the relatively small amount the team already has would be enough to send them spiralling into serious damage control. Once the raid is complete and the true extent revealed, they will never recover, and it will likely cause a chain reaction. This could be the case of decades. Despite how nervous the team is, this operation is honestly like shooting fish in a barrel. The Navy stands no chance."
 japnavybrief.8.a:0 "We're so close."
 japnavybrief.9.t:0 "And We Sure As Hell Are"
 japnavybrief.9.d:0 "Finally, the team went over one final review. This was the actual last one before they move on to the next stage. It was a review of reviews of reviews, as everyone involved had been briefed countless times to ensure all data was factored in and all bases covered. Everyone had to be reminded a final time that no matter the consequences, what is being done here is right and just. The Navy has refused to aid the investigation, and the only likely explanation is to save their own hides as the hammer comes down. More importantly than anything else, the Navy is clearly extremely guilty here, and any consequences they will face will be beyond deserved.\n\nThe final preparations were at hand. The team began to transition and move forward. Despite all that has happened, only then did the true gravity of the situation begin to sink in for many of those gathered. They were no longer helping Tachi and Kodaira investigate just another murder. They were ripping the curtain away to expose the corrupt underbelly of a cheating, lying organization, no matter what was really there. They could well be changing Japanese history, for better or for worse."

 #The Investigation Endgame
 japendgame.1.t:0 "Rotten Soldiers, Moneyed Ships"
 japendgame.1.d:0 "Day by day the crowds gathered around the headquarters of the Army and Navy grew. Since the press release the public had been up in arms, and rare was the day that passed without an attack on a high-level military officer. Police officers could no longer intervene - the hate was mutual - and the internal police was fighting for its life. The IJA and IJN were, for all intents and purposes, dead in the water.\n\nKodaira and Tachi should have been celebrating at this point; their prime targets had been proven demonstrably guilty. But two niggling issues haunted them, two loose ends begging for resolution.\n\nThe first was drawn from the use of several code words drawn from conversations and interrogations with various military staff, the names of famous cultural landmarks; "Kamakura Buddha", "Kyoto Golden Temple", "Kyoto Silver Temple". All codeword owners were spoken of in a deferential tone and appeared to have pulled strings behind the string-pullers. But the transactions traceable to these codeword accounts did not correspond to the Army or Navy; in fact, even the Imperial General Headquarters appeared to be innocent. So who was above the Headquarters?\n\nThe second was this; the Army and Navy, the civilian government's biggest enemies, were busy collapsing, so why was the civilian government falling to pieces along with them? And did anyone really want to know the answer?"

 japendgame.2.t:0 "The Private Commission"
 japendgame.2.d:0 "The press room was rank from consecutive days of public hearings, but not from sweat or exhaustion - the scent of fear was heady, and it was everywhere. The team wore the expressions of children with their hands caught deep in the cookie jar. Ironic, given the circumstances, but nobody was laughing.\n\nKodaira's speech was short to the point of curtness. To prevent further internal interference, a private commission would be set up with the facilitation of the Tokyo Metropolitan and granted extraordinary powers to search, arrest and interrogate across all branches of government. It was the will of the Emperor - and here he paused for emphasis - that the investigation reach just conclusions.\n\nScarcely had the meeting ended when a note was passed to him by a staffer; it was impossible even to catch his disappearing outline in the crowds of journalists. Kodaira opened the note, noting the letterhead.\n\n"Stop before you are encircled and destroyed. Your fight was brave, but it ends here. We are watching.\n\nYours, the Thousand Temples."\n\nBaffled, he raised his head just in time to catch Tachi's cry. "Kodaira, our leads in the Navy are in trouble! Orders from the Diet-""

 japendgame.3.d:0 "As the team hastily reassembled their work, damage reports confirmed the worst. Some kind of purge was taking place in the Army and Navy ministries, and it was being directed not by the command staff but from the dizzying heights of civilian bureaucracy. Some of their prominent leads had been caught up in the chaos. Something was very wrong.\n\nKodaira and Tachi were running out of time.\n\nThe crisis meeting stretched into the long hours; many on the team had let their unspoken fears take hold of them and wanted to shut down the investigation before their own heads wound up on executive platters. What emerged was a consensus that the work had to be done as quickly as possible, to attempt to outflank the Government.\n\nArrest warrants and lists of suspects were hastily compiled, and the team divided into ministry sections to tackle each list, to hit the Government as hard as they could. If they couldn't manage a full sweep of the Thousand Temples, they could at least nab enough of them to kill momentum.\n\nNobody said the obvious, but it was on their minds regardless; time was the only insurance they had left, and the results had to come in before their own arrests did. The Japanese police had a 99 percent conviction rate. Even for their own men."

 japendgame.4.d:0 "Everyone knew that the Bureau of Public Order, in theory the Civilian Police's representative to the Emperor, was in reality a fair-weather friend of their juniors. The Bureau seldom did its assigned work these days, focusing instead on arcane power games in the Byzantine structures of the Empire. Even so, nobody had quite expected the about face the Bureau now made.\n\nIn orders crafted to maximise humiliation, the Bureau essentially dressed down the entire team for acting above their pay grade, station and status before the Emperor. This was fairly normal treatment, and to be expected; but what surprised the team was the blunt demand of the corpus of the investigation, evidence and all, to be moved to Bureau headquarters and safekept for "an indefinite period". The reasons cited were the preservation of the dignity of the Government and the Emperor, as well as the need to safeguard potentially sensitive data. Uninspiring, but effective.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances the orders ordering them to stop could at least have been published, but this order was classified so highly that to release it would have been an immediate death sentence for most of Kodaira and Tachi's team. It was an outrage and an impediment of justice, but you could admire the handiwork.\n\nDazed and confused, the team halted work. A missive seething with rage and vitriol was drafted, redrafted and hastily sent to the shredder before it could do any harm."

 japendgame.5.t:0 "Resistance from Without"
 japendgame.5.d:0 "No one was sure when the low-grade civil war brewing in the Diet and in the Imperial government at large had quietened to a simmer, but somehow the worst had passed. Nobody knew why, but most of the team were thankful that the world around them had remained somewhat intact even as the military fell apart. It was reassuring to know that Japan hadn't yet become a military state and was in fact increasingly unlikely to do so, given the state of its armed forces.\n\nOne evening a letter was received from the Imperial General Headquarters, in anonymous typescript and generic government-issue letterhead. It was similar in content to countless other missives received that week, all of which ordered the team to cease and desist under the pretext of protecting the dignity of the Emperor. What was different was what came after. The signage of the letter read like a who's who of the most powerful members of the Imperial government; senior members of the Diet and Cabinet, the Army, the Navy and the Headquarters itself had all penned signatures in person. Kodaira's files indicated that half of these individuals were embroiled in intrigue against each other in the upper heavens of the government's chambers. If this were the case, how did they all end up signing the same petition?\n\nThe answer arrived in the form of a team from the headquarters the following week, brandishing a warrant for immediate audit for suspected treasonous activities against the Emperor. As they searched the office (ignoring the cries of the already overburdened investigation team) Kodaira found in their warrant the seals of a half-dozen major ministerial appointments; but above them was the thick, unmistakeable seal of the Kokusei's council.\n\nIt was now clear to everyone who the Thousand Temples were, and why the Government had closed ranks. What could be done to stop them, however..."

 japendgame.6.d:0 "Kodaira was tired, even by the standards of the metropolitan police of the Jewel of the East. A sleepless man for a sleepless city, dancing on the edge of collapse. The investigation and months of his team's time appeared to be slipping into the gutter, and there was little he could do to stop it; he was reminded of the old stories of children playing with the Gods, pretending at equal status.\n\nHe pored through the documents. The seals on the letter corresponded to senior positions in the Government, but they seemed to have come from somewhere else; analysis of the seals' imprints revealed that this was a wax used for financial purposes. Why had the letter been stamped with accounting seals rather than executive ones? And what did this mean for the investigation?\n\nA cursory search of the invoicing records the team had captured revealed nothing. All the seals' they had on record corresponded to senior executives whose names they already knew in ministries slated for audit. Pictures of contracts they'd captured revealed nothing as well; the seals' identity and function eluded him. Kodaira worked through the night, chasing the paperwork in expanding spirals, and by the next morning he had an answer for a very confused Tachi.\n\nThe seals on the letter had been found in the Minezaka records they'd seized in the fishing factory, and the peculiar thing was that the seals hadn't been found in an isolated one or two places. Out of 371 documents seized by the initial investigation, 320 of them had a match for one or more seals used. It had slipped past the initial investigation (most government firms had ministerial seals for documentation and approval) but it could no longer be ignored.\n\nThe government wasn't above this scandal - it was right there in the mud with the rest of them."

Two teams of the most powerful agencies in Japan were snapping at each other, with members of his own team desperately trying to get both sides to stand down. Hands to holsters, the Police Department held its breath.\n\nThe Imperial General Headquarters had sent a team of specialist bureaucrats to commandeer what evidence could be taken to safeguard it for the Emperor's protection in a facility guarded by themselves. It was unfortunate that they'd happened to meet a team from the Bureau of Public Order sent to commandeer what evidence could be taken for the exact same purpose. Now they glared at each other, the team heads practically throwing warrants at each other in efforts to prove the other an inferior in carrying out the Emperor's will.\n\nLooking at the two of them, Tachi had an idea. Didn't the Art of War say that enemies were best defeated when divided? And didn't they possess significant reserves of evidence that everyone wanted - but only one agency could keep?\n\nThe plan formed in his mind then, and festered through the rest of the day into a full-blown strategy. If they could pull it off, survival would be a possibility. And slim hope was better than none at all."

Between the 10 or so members gathered only a couple had children, and all were so exhausted by the investigative efforts that few had actually visited their parents in months. Even so, they hoped, perhaps this would be the last push, the final struggle to some imagined victory. And as the details were laid out in the flickering lights of the rooms, that hope only grew.\n\nKodaira and Tachi reorganized the team for the umpteenth time, focusing on three major conflict vectors under the ragged Imperial umbrella; the Bureau of Public Order, the Diet and the Army and Navy. The latter were undergoing a full-scale internal "reorganization", complete with occasional gunfight, but still possessed enough internal cohesion to be a potential threat to the other two. And the plan was simple at heart; turn the three agencies against each other in such a way that the conflict would escalate and spill into the courts, forcing the release of the documents they needed.\n\nThe Trojan Horse lay ready for entrance into three separate Troys, a series of invoices with seals from all three agencies, with Minezaka logistics, Army money and Navy shipping.

That was really the best that could be managed, and given the dire straits that every branch of the government were in even an offer like this could easily be the best one the Diet might receive. After all, they were on the brink too, and they would have to take any opportunity possible to try and save themselves as what seemed like the entire government collapsed around them into the boiling sea of corruption and disorganization.\n\nThe proposal was simple, if worded to be long-winded and noble to flatter the Diet: given the conflicts of interest elsewhere in the government and the possibility for further damage, the Diet was the best organization left to safeguard evidence regarding the investigation. Their cooperation would surely shield them from much of the upcoming chaos, and their assistance would prove their dedication to justice and the innocence of many Diet members. They would safeguard the evidence from the corrupt and prying eyes elsewhere in the government and navy, reaping all the benefits of doing so. Tachi and Kodaira had worded the letter to be just right, hopefully appealing to the sense of urgency and desire to remain safe that the Diet members all felt. They hoped that it would be enough to win an ally, at least for the moment."

The entire government and the military were gunning to seize evidence and shut down the investigation, and Kodaira knew that they were all in far too deep to let this go now. He would see justice or die trying, and he would take any help he could get to see that happen.\n\nSeveral of his old contacts, people he had once considered true friends, flat-out refused to meet with him. Eventually, however, he had met with a few of them, those who knew there was no other option. The offer was simple: they and their soldiers in the Army and Navy would safeguard evidence pertinent to the investigation. In return, their reputation could still be safeguarded, and perhaps they would survive and make it to the other side after this whole debacle settled down. Every time he made the offer, he knew it was a lie, but the people he talked to were so desperate for any chance to escape that they agreed. Even a hope that they knew deep down was false was better than the chasm that faced them currently. Kodaira just wished that they had never put themselves in this situation in the first place."

This general tiredness made it extremely difficult to conduct a proper meeting with an outside representative, which was exactly what Tachi was trying to do. A lot hung on this meeting, and if the Bureau chose not to comply, it could be the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nTachi decided to for once in this entire ordeal to cut the shit and talk frankly. No more flowery language and dancing around what was really on the table. He set out the offer as so: the Bureau of Public Order would assist in the storage and safekeeping of evidence so that hostile and potentially corrupt forces within the government could not seize them. In exchange, Tachi promised that if the evidence was secured then the investigation could be turned to politically benefit the Bureau. His up-front manner surprised the people he was meeting with, but the response was promising. They continued their endless game of double meanings and non-incriminating vague half-statements, but Tachi was able to gather that they were accepting the deal.

The inner circle of the government the investigation team selected to release the transaction invoices' history and extensive documentation is not an airtight one, yet the extraordinary circumstances they cite threaten the future of the entire nation itself. He ends the broadcast and sends the files to the officials listening in shock, and in less than an hour later the three agencies are set aflame.\n\nWith the crimes of the Army, Navy, and Diet implicated with dozens of pieces of evidence for every transgression, government hearings have been filed and are already set in order to acquire the damning records. The halls of Tokyo are filled with the disorganized shouting and the exasperated screaming of those named, each agency clamouring for its access, each giving different reasons as to how they are fit to secure it "for the good of the Japanese people and the Emperor."

The cultivated contacts from the police have been put to effect, and now offer to help out all three agencies with their pursuits. The giant bureaucracies and entities controlling Japan will soon find themselves trapped by the rules they themselves made.\n\nThe agencies have already hastily granted wide-open access to the police investigation team, quickly moving to secure all of the transcriptions. The hearings held themselves have resulted in the granting of access to voluminous incendiary material surrounding the agencies' dealings with each other.

His message was short and tersely delivered: the Government would comply with the investigation to its fullest ability. He brought with him dozens of binders, each big enough to carry perhaps years worth of data. They were all quickly dropped off and the representative left.\n\nTachi and Kodaira were quickly informed. They looked at each other for a moment, sharing a glance of simultaneous eagerness, fear, and confusion, before quickly standing up and heading down to grab the binders. After a few trips back and forth to gather them all, they each grabbed the top binder from their stack and started to read.\n\nBoth of their binders contained the same general kinds of info. It was not pretty. All the transcripts were true. Paper after paper documented truly staggering amounts of money flowing from the navy and the army into the accounts of politicians. The further they read, the higher profile the names became. Soon they were no longer truly reading the reports, just skimming them and noting every single name they came across. Not a single innocent person was mentioned from the front to the back.\n\nKodaira picked up another binder, having already gotten through several, and started to read. This one was different, however. This did not document any suspicious transactions or politicians, at least not in the same way as the other. This was a full government-ordered report on the state of corruption. It had been chartered and viewed by the highest in the government, and then tossed aside. A single note at the end stated that the report was to be archived in high-clearance storage and forgotten, for the security of Japan. No, for the security of the people running it."

The energy was channeled into work so frantic it seemed like a burst of public madness; talk veered and jolted between talk of leads and the next step, the next agency to find.\n\nKodaira and Tachi found solace in their most recent routine. To properly conduct an accounting audit, an uninvolved neutral agency had to be found; they had devoted themselves to finding it. With a book of the most influential auditing agencies and accounting firms in Japan in hand, they holed themselves up in the rooms for a week, working their way past the streams of data. Slowly the web began to unravel.\n\nThe accountants involved had covered their tracks with exceeding competence, but certain irregular patterns were suspiciously similar to others, and if they could be proven to link to an accounting firm, the firm could be supposed to be compromised. The name of the firm was crossed out on the books and the search would continue.\n\nName by name, number by number, the anonymity of the accountants began to collapse. And the lists of the book grew shorter, and shorter, and broke into pieces which shrunk, and shrunk, and shrunk again.\n\nOne day Kodaira woke up early, as was his nature, and took a browse through the cross-ridden book in the hall. And then another, and another. He managed, with great effort, to keep from screaming. Instead he sunk into his chair, half-sobbing, to be found by a worried Tachi.\n\nEvery single name on the book had been crossed out."

He was on his side, keeled over into a shallow pool of his own blood. His hands still gripped the hilt of a very old and very expensive wakizashi, a centuries-old antique and one of his most prized possessions. His face was frozen in a sad frown, his eyes as empty dead as they had been when he announced his resignation.\n\nThe police quickly rushed to inform his son, but they found him missing too. There was a brief panic until it was discovered that he had skipped town on a plane less than an hour after his father's body had officially been found. He was on his way to India, officially on business, in truth because the entire world was collapsing around him. There was little chance of catching him now, and even less reason in trying.\n\nJust a few hours later, yet another heap of documents emerged. The Minezaka corporation was now shown to have almost certainly assisted the government, army, and navy with their operations. They had used their business expertise and many assets to shuffle money around, skim just enough for nobody to notice, and keep anyone who might object off the scent. They had even audited the vast majority of the accounts involved in order to keep suspicion at a minimum. Every level of power was now implicated with solid evidence.

He took the glass with a mumbled thanks and savored the harsh flavor.\n\nA lesser ranking officer poked in his head and delivered some more papers. Kodaira initially tried to decline, saying to just put it to the side so they could get to it in due time, but the officer said this was different. This had just come from the Ino Clique itself. That got Kodaira to stand up and snatch the papers right from the officers hands. He struggled to keep his eyes steady as they ran up and down the paper.\n\nHe sighed and sat down before handing the tiny stack to Tachi. The younger detective read over them as well, then looked at Kodaira in shock. The clique was now agreeing to cooperate with the investigation fully. Anything the team asked for, as long as it was relevant to the case, would be delivered. All they wanted in exchange was a guarantee of safety. The Ino Clique would be secure, and in return everything and everyone else would be fair game."

The report was titanic, large enough to make one wonder if every citizen in the Empire was being accused. After a final day of nervous preparations and finalizations, the report was released.\n\nBy the next day, literally hundreds of arrest warrants had been issued. Diet members, cabinet members, politicians, businessmen, previously admirable figures, all were stopped and brought in as mere criminals. They were joined by a staggering amount of generals, admirals, and officers, both major and minor. A good number were yet to be captured, and they continued to trickle in as the fallout grew harsher.\n\nThe Minezaka corporation was on the absolute brink of collapse. The vast majority of its remaining leadership had been incarcerated, and what little remained was extraordinarily unprepared to deal with this. It was teetering and would be knocked over by a slight breeze or push, and this was more akin to a city-shredding hurricane. Every sign pointed to a collapse in consumer confidence. There was no coming back for the Minezaka corporation.\n\nThere was no coming back for anyone."

And the halls are full of chatter this week, as the investigation has captured the minds of the company just as it has captured their newspresses.\n\nAsato Kokei is a recent arrival fresh from the university, and he believes he's stumbled onto something big. Very big indeed. Errors have begun to proliferate on the balance sheet of Yasuda Bank, which is worrying, especially since he's in a junior role in the Bank's accounting division. But what is more perplexing still are the sources of the errors: a series of large anonymous numbers attributable to Minezaka Group. The company's been all over the press recently, and for the wrong reasons: and yet no one will tell him why the company under investigation has paid sums of money to Yasuda, and for no discernible reason at all.\n\nToday he's scheduled a meeting with his boss, in the hopes of arranging some assistance and perhaps netting a promotion out of the matter. After all, it's a matter of profit, and profit is Yasuda's bread and butter. The boss even takes time out of his schedule to meet him personally, which is rare.

As a result, the baby was hungry, but there was not enough food in the house to feed him. Her untucked breast was sore and chafed in the last-ditch attempts hours ago to feed her son, but to no avail. She could not provide the breastmilk for her baby, and a sense of defeat loomed over her enervated body.\n\nShe continued to rock her screaming baby in the darkened rooms of her dingy apartment, praying that her child would finally come to rest, but the cries only continued throughout the early morning. Drenched in sweat, her dirty nightgown hung over her tired shoulders as she could barely stand up for much longer. She threw herself back into a chair, and rocked the baby with a drowsy passion, distressed and debilitated by her sufferings as an isolated mother in the dullness of the night."

 japyasuda.12.t:0 "The Cost Of The Crash"
 japyasuda.12.d:0 "Police siren lights twinkled in the pattering rain falling down upon Tokyo's night time evening streets. The sky was a dark blue, overcast with gloomy clouds that casted a great shadow over the mighty city. A small crowd had gathered around a crime scene outside of the Tokyo Stock Exchange building from behind blue wooden barriers, each guarded by a policeman in a drenched raincoat. The chatter and murmur of passersby that filled the streets were drowned out by the splash of rainfall and the echoing of police car sirens.\n\nBehind the stretched tape, police barriers, and patrolling law enforcement agents were the violently disfigured bodies of some of Tokyo's top economists. They were public names; they had written in newspapers, spoken on television, and were regulars in the facility. Now, however, their bodies were bludgeoned and pulverized in the black and puddle-ridden roads from the impact of leaping from the roof, in what the police department is considering a suicide pact between the men. According to recent records over the last few weeks, their invested stocks and shares have plummeted in value since the crash, and their invested wealth had practically disappeared in mere moments.\n\nMortgage default rates have skyrocketed; banks have begun to fail as loans could not be repaid; entire corporations have declared bankruptcies; most alarming of all, reported homelessness and deaths have begun to fill up official records for in most of the prefectures. The recent economic crises afflicting Japan have spawned many of these events across the empire, and although many big names in Japan have remained reactive in following the effects of the turbulence, millions in the middle and working classes have been plunged into the conditions of a despairing economic depression. Examined and prodded by investigators, the men's lifeless bodies were left uncovered in the rain beneath the towering stock exchange building."

He looked up from the floor of the metro station, onlookers glaring in amusement and confusion. A couple passersby spat on him, others laughed out loud in front of his gloomy figure. The sweat continued to roll, forming a puddle beneath his heavy legs. He snatched a piece of cloth from his reeking tuxedo and wiped his forehead. It did little to alleviate the perspiring steam from his balding scalp. His glasses dropped to the ground, under which a commuter 'accidentally' stomped forward. Losing all hope, he pushed himself to his knees, grovelling at the feet of the people passing by.\n\n"Please! A few coins! I just need to get home, please!"\n\nA crowd formed, whispering between themselves about the humiliating sight in front of them. A porky businessman, no doubt, fresh from the stock market floors. With a snap of the fingers, it was gone. A lifetime of investments and buildup from speculation, all vanished in an instant and with it gone the man had no choice but to display his shame to thousands for a few coins. The station was filled with rushing onlookers and commuters, but emptied of any mercy or compassion. A young man, with fire bellowing in his eyes, stepped forward and whispered "no." He then spat onto the businessman's forehead, and with that, the crowd dispersed for the trains. The businessman slumped back against the wall, dejected, the spit joining his sweat."

 japyasuda.14.d:0 "In the mid-afternoon, a great commotion sounded from within blocks of the Yasuda office buildings in the districts of western Tokyo. Crashes of metal and furniture sounded from above as shattered window panes fell into the streets, exploding in a glittery array of glass daggers on the concrete pavement. Screams and wails followed, and roars of curious crowds gathered outside the Yasuda building had surrounded the paved entrance to the offices.\n\nThe police arrived at the scene a few minutes after the swathes of civilians had gathered to investigate the commotion, and set up barriers to shepherd people away from the courtyard. Suddenly, another great cry came from the crowds as more great crashes and pounds came from the block just ahead of them.\n\nFormer employees, clearly caught in fist fights and skirmishes in the building, scurried out of the main entrance to the offices in front of the police, carrying trophies, watches, and other small valuables in their arms. They tumbled down the short steps at lightning speeds and dragged small trinkets and goods with them, presumably stolen from cabinets to sell in the market for much needed relief. The crowds gasped in horror to see them clamber across the courtyards, and the mere sight of such an outrageous chaos bewildered law enforcement attempting to calm the crowds."

 japyasuda.15.d:0 "Yaling clutched the slip, reading the text over and over again. Let go. Let go to "cut expenses." She looked into the tiny window, into the falling snow, wondering if others like her shared the same fate. Under her feet was a suitcase, "graciously" provided by her captors. Perhaps there was a tinge of light in the darkness. Yaling heard the creak of the door; another woman walked into her room. Feng, clad in a simple dress, sat on the other side of the room. "Did you get dismissed?" Yaling held up the slip.\n\nFeng sighed, slumping against the wall. "No. They still want me, I think." Yaling could not figure out whether she felt bad or relieved for her friend. In truth, she believed Feng was feeling the same for her. "I-I'm not sure if either of our situations are good. You can't speak Japanese and act like one." A pause, frozen cold, descended upon the room. "And I have to continue working here."\n\nYaling had not thought of the future. Outside of the women's quarters, she had no connections - and barely enough money to last her a month. After she packed her meager belongings and went out into the cold, what would happen? Could she even go back home? "Only fate knows my future. I just hope we'll meet again." Yaling's eyes watered, as her head pounded from holding the tears back. Sniffling, she continued. "You're a good woman, Feng. I hope you do well." She nodded, sensing that she should leave. Yaling kneeled in front of her bed, opening the briefcase and packing her clothes. After today, she would go to the wolves."
 japyasuda.15.a:0 "If human life is priceless, why are so many thrown away?"
 japyasuda.16.t:0 "To the Wolves"
 japyasuda.16.d:0 "Fresh snow covered the sidewalks of the city, as Yaling shivered, her threadbare coat practically unusable. Snowflakes fell on her hair, clinging onto the strands. She walked by restaurants, where patrons enjoyed warm food and drink. Oh, how Yaling anguished. In her fitful dreams, when she was not reliving years of horror, she dreamed of a better life. Free from her memories, free to just live. Free to live the promises that brought her here. She looked into the window of a closed store, staring at her reflection.\n\nThe years had sapped her youth and strength. If only I didn't fall for those lies, she thought forlornly. She dissolved her reflection, not wanting to relive the cruel past. Yaling trudged on, hope abandoning her soul. Walking past other pedestrians, she received strange looks. She looked away from any men, and women whispered as soon as they saw her.\n\nIn her heart, she knew why. They did not know her previous profession - she wished she didn't. But her appearance was one of poverty: her face was dirtied, hair uncombed, and eyes bagged. Not even the poorest, cast off by the current crisis, spared any sympathy for the woman. All Yaling could speak was silence; she couldn't communicate, for Japanese was lost on her. All she could see was indifference to her situation, memories of only discomfort. And all she could hear was her heart breaking. The wind picked up, buffeting her with more cold. Yaling could only walk against it."

 japyasuda.17.d:0 "The sea breeze brought with it the smell of salt, giving Yaling a moment of peace. Her dress fluttered, as her hair dried in the wind. In and out, she reminded herself. Breathe in - she took a deep breath - breathe out. The docks in the early morning were her favorite place. From her vantage point, she could see the golden sun rise. Sitting on top of her suitcase, she could see a disk of orange slowly rising. Perhaps not the wisest choice - it did sting to look at such light - but it wasn't like she could last long here.\n\nIn the distance, voices. Male voices. The workers were here for their shift. Looking behind her, she could see that they were deep in conversation - she could escape. Picking up the suitcase, she darted behind a shipping container, hoping they didn't notice her. Yaling steeled herself in case they...no. Not again. Breathe in, breathe out, she reminded herself. Panic wouldn't help her get away from the men.\n\nThe men stopped in between her container and the one opposite. Yaling could only look at them in terror, as she was frozen solid. A slight look. Just a slight turn and her worst fears would attack her again. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. She shivered, her heart beating like artillery on the battlefield.\n\nThe men disappeared to the front of her container. Yaling slumped down and put her face into her hands, hot tears flowing down her face."

 #Economic Wars
 japeconwars.1.t:0 "증권거래소의 공황"
 japeconwars.1.d:0 "With the collapse of the Yasuda zaibatsu, the atmosphere at the Tokyo Stock Exchange has been one of pure chaos. Buyers are frantically selling their shares in every company vaguely affiliated with Yasuda, hoping desperately to cut their lines to the sinking ship loose before they're pulled down with it. Many of them would consider themselves lucky if they can sell their stocks for fifty sen on the yen, cash in hand. However, there are fewer and fewer lucky people by the minute, as the ticker tape continues to print smaller and smaller values.\n\nThe effect is already painfully apparent. Several dozen financiers and stockbrokers have committed suicide after seeing their life savings vanish before their eyes, or watch the companies they represent plummet towards bankruptcy like their coworkers out of high-rise windows. One particularly grisly case was a vice president of the Yamaha Corporation, who shot himself in the head using an old IJN service pistol in the Stock Exchange's bathroom. Although the government is preparing a response, it seems that for today, they are powerless to do nothing but watch as the beating heart of Japan's economy slowly succumbs to cardiac arrest."
 japeconwars.1.a:0 "God help us!"
 japeconwars.2.t:0 "Giving a Hundred and Twenty-Five Percent"
 japeconwars.2.d:0 "It seems that a war that once solely occupied the offices of Tokyo financiers has spilled out into the rice paddies and rubber plantations of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At noon, all the major zaibatsus sent nearly identical telegrams to their agricultural holdings in China and Vietnam with a simple order: production quotas are increasing by twenty-five percent as of next month. An hour later, an order order came from many of the keiretsus' offices to their plantations, demanding a similar increase in production. Although this caused some mild consternation from native farmhands about the feasibility of the goal and the impact on their personal health, some mild policing by the Kwantung Army was enough to convince them to go back to work. All rumors of unrest are simply rumors, no Sumitomo coal miners in Chengdu are rioting, and Nissan's steel mills in Manchuria are all functioning normally.\n\nAs to the origin of the quotas, it isn't quite clear why this started, which of the zaibatsu acted first, or why the keiretsu responded. Was it the reaction of the others to seeing one raise quotas, afraid that their business rivals knew something they didn't? Was it a bluff, an attempt to force their competitors to attempt unsustainable levels of production? Was it a simultaneous attempt by both factions to corner the market? Is it to fix prices? Or are they all stocking up for something nobody else knows about?"
 japeconwars.2.a:0 "Let's hope they don't alter the quotas any further."
 japeconwars.3.t:0 "Empty Shelves, Empty Screens"
 japeconwars.3.d:0 "Many in the Home Islands who were not involved in finances once felt that the zaibatsu-keiretsu trade wars would only affect them if they chose to open the business section in their newspaper. However, it seems that the crisis has finally begun to disrupt their lives in a personal way that they never anticipated.\n\nAt first, nobody paid attention when the price of new televisions crept up by several hundred yen, figuring that it was just some new upgraded model rolling out onto the market. But it wasn't an upgraded model. In fact, there wasn't any new model released at all this year. None of the major electronics brands-Totsuko, Hitachi, JVC, Panasonic, or Toshiba-have even continued producing last year's models, let alone announce a new product line. Rumors have also spread of a Toshiba television factory in the Saitama Prefecture being shuttered overnight without so much as a warning to the employees. It seems that with the zaibatsus and keiretsus embargoing components and resources once freely traded, their corporate overlords have had to start tightening their belts and halting production of low-priority products. And judging by how the shelves in electronic stores grow barer and the prices creep higher every day, it seems that they have consigned their television brands to such a fate."
 japeconwars.3.a:0 "Politics killed the video star."
 japeconwars.4.t:0 "The Bells are Silent"
 japeconwars.4.d:0 "One of the latest (and certainly the oddest) casualties of the recent economic war has been none other than the humble bicycle. An industry once dominated by a plethora of small-to-medium sized businesses like Kuwahara and Mizutani, it has been transformed in recent months into another market where the zaibatsus and keiretsus battle for dominance. The first to make serious headway into the market was the Matsushita keiretsu, who began selling bicycles under the "National" brand name. This triggered a frenzy of buying, as zaibatsu and keiretsu alike both began to buy up as many bicycle retailers in the Home Islands as they could. And when a company refused to sell, the conglomerates would either outbid them on steel contracts, or in the case of zaibatsus who owned steel mills, simply refuse to sell to them.\n\nThe effect on the Japanese consumer has slowly become apparent. New bicycles are hard to acquire from any company, and replacement parts for old ones are nearly impossible to come by. The shortage of components has meant that mechanics have had to cannibalize other bicycles for parts, build their own improvised ones, or simply tell their customers to make do (which is especially tricky when it's the brakes that are broken). The Tokyo Metropolitan Police have reported at least half a dozen injuries in the last month as a result of bicycles breaking due to homemade replacement parts. Although this is hardly a noteworthy statistic, it will surely increase as time marches onward, and the corporations continue their fight."

 # Japanese Indonesia War Reaction loc
 japindonesiawar.0.t:0 "REPORT ON THE ONGOING CONFLICT IN INDONESIA"
 japindonesiawar.0.d:0 "BACKGROUND: Following extensive civil unrest resulting from communist guerillas, dissatisfaction with government religious policy, and the increasing executive power of President Sukarno, culminating in the referendum on Presidential Decree no. 321/1965 which was heavily manipulated, Vice President Hatta and a handful of rebels have declared open rebellion against the Indonesian government in order to depose President Sukarno.\n\nASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SITUATION: While President Sukarno still maintains control of the armed forces, rebel groups have infiltrated most of the country and carry out sabotage from behind the lines, turning the war in favor of Hatta. It is likely that Hatta has reached out to the United States for assistance, and it is equally likely that they will provide it in the form of weapons, advisors, and even troops in order to secure his victory and destabilize the Sphere. The heavy jungle covering much of Indonesia will likely bog down the conflict and incentivize the use of guerilla warfare.\n\nRECOMMENDED COURSE OF ACTION: The Japanese Army should, with all due haste, move to support President Sukarno with arms, equipment, and men to put down Hatta's rebellion and restore order in Indonesia. The longer that the war continues, the less stable the Sphere will appear on the world stage and, in the situation that Hatta succeeds, it will deal a heavy blow to Japan in the Cold War with the United States. President Sukarno must crush Hatta's rebellion as soon as possible."

 japindonesiawar.1.t:0 "Observe and Report"
 japindonesiawar.1.d:0 "Conflict roared across Indonesia, and the burning pyres of the archipelago were vivid in the Prime Minister's daydreams. He could see the anarchy and chaos ripping apart the island chain and dismantling the once rich and resourceful Japanese ally. The country was divided between factions, armies, militias, and rival governments; a mess Japan had to try and understand before anyone else could. The general staff sat with the Prime Minister, eager to discuss what action should be taken to intervene. The generals throthed at the mouth with ideas of airstrikes and invasion plans, and the admirals could not sit still over thoughts of marine assaults and naval incursions. Sat at the head of the table, he could see the hysteria of war ahead of him. He cleared his throat, and the room fell silent in a brief moment.\n\nHe began to explain the disorganised findings of Japanese reconnaissance, and the attention of the general staff to the briefing was undivided. They listened diligently, but seemed to scribble down notes for their own benefit, perhaps focusing on their own opportunities for infamy in the conflict abroad. The Prime Minister felt alone and tired as he continued speaking, growing bored of the immaturity of the general staff as they seemed to draft plans to become war heroes rather than focusing on the crises at hand. Questions were thrown back and forth, which were only followed by more scribbled of their own, each infuriating the Prime Minister more. Growing bitter, he dismissed the briefing, and a cold shiver ran up his's spine. He licked his lips and pouted, trying to make sense of the rushing ideas:\n\n"A threat to the Emperor's Peace," he thought, but he feared the worst was yet to come."

 japindonesiawar.2.t:0 "Sukarno Triumphs"
 japindonesiawar.2.d:0 "With the recent conclusion of the Battle of Surabaya, the general staff gathered in the Prime Minister's office to discuss the future of Japanese intervention in the Indonesian war. The general staff sat scattered across the room, some reclining in leather chairs, others standing upright to examine recently dusted bookshelves. The attention in the room seemed to be divided, until Prime Minister had cleared his throat and began speaking:\n\n"Gentlemen, we believe that Sukarno is the man to back in the Indonesian conflict. He has proven himself loyal and resourceful to us already, and his confidence is a tool we can exploit further in the affairs of the archipelago."\n\n[Root.GetLeader] drew files from his cabinets; papers full of information on Sukarno's potential, graphs evaluating military capabilities, and predictions of success dependent on Japanese intervention. Members of the general staff strolled over to [Root.GetLeader]'s desk and flicked through the files for a short while, nodding their heads at the streams of numbers and charts as if they understood it. They were convinced, it seemed, as they looked back up at the Prime Minister with small grins. [Root.GetLeader] waved his finger at the group of men, and told them plans of intervention. After listening diligently, suggestions were thrown across the room, and his initial ideas were silenced by the officer's enthusiastic bickering over stratagem. The Prime Minister sat behind his desk, not able to get a word into the debates between the general staff, but reclined with satisfaction now he had the support of these jingoists to sail into the heart of the Indonesian conflict."

We will send more details soon"\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s secretary had rushed in and placed the received fax on the desk. He read the short note and was silent for a moment. After a harsh sigh, he pushed away the still warm paper and reclined in his chair. A scorn wiped through the Prime Minister's head, angry at Sukarno's tactless and foolish leadership over what was left of the Indonesian government. His eyes shut, and he exhaled a calm breath, leaning forward to reach for the telephone.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] grabbed the telephone by the handle, and stopped just as he was about to punch in the numbers to contact his general staff. He hesitated, reflecting on their reactions to his news, and was overcome with a second wave of lethargy. The generals nor the admirals would appreciate anything of the sort. He could envision the roars of anger, the silent disappointment, the burdening sarcasm, and threw the telephone back in its place as he fell backwards into his chair again. Pulling out a diary, and expressing his doubts for military support of a leftist regime in Southeast Asia, [Root.GetLeader] was in awe of the pathetic defeat Sukarno now carried with him.\n\nAs he could hear a second fax printing through outside his office, [Root.GetLeader] jumped to dial the number, saving himself the opportunity to damn himself with worse news to tell them. It would be a long night for the Prime Minister, but an even longer war for Japanese interests in Indonesia."

 japindonesiawar.4.t:0 "Arrival of the Osaka Tokubetsu Rikugun"
 japindonesiawar.4.d:0 "The flash of the camera had engraved this moment in Indonesian history forever; Sukarno shaking the hands of Japanese generals and admirals in Djakarta's harbours, welcoming them to his side of the Indonesian war. As each of the men strolled off of the ships, Sukarno bowed and greeted them individually, thanking them profusely for their support of his regime. His thanks were drowned out by a small and anemic orchestra organised to play Japanese war songs, all of which the general staff turned their noses up at. He scurried behind the men, and waved to the Indonesian people who were observing from afar. The crowds were few and far between; paying more attention to the Japanese generals, fearfully aware of their actions during their occupation twenty years before.\n\nMore warships sailed in towards the harbor, slowly moving with a mammoth metal groan, all armed to the teeth with monstrous guns. Planes shot through the sky, leaving a thick trail of red and white, and shuddered the ground below the crowds. The colossal Japanese machines of war stood tall and dwarfed the Indonesians below, even at significant distance. The conductor at the foot of the harbor, aware of the tense air, began a signal to play 'Kimigayo' louder as a distraction from the terror, but only intensified the mist of anguish. The generals laughed, and the admirals sniggered, pointing at the fearful Indonesian civilians in the crowds as they cowered before their gaze. Musicians played the tune and fell out of tempo, catching the attention of Sukarno, who gave a ghastly stare at the conductor and signalled for him to amend the melody. The Japanese command cackled, extending their arms towards Sukarno and invited him to further talks, perhaps saving him from the embarrassment of facing such a pathetic introduction alone. Sukarno disappeared into the group of generals, shuffling along as they marched down a path lined with young Indonesian soldiers. The welcome casted a great shadow over Sukarno's regime, and fears for the future of a peaceful Indonesia buzzed in the air amongst the dissipating crowds."

The pulsing sea was a deep and mystical azure as he was cradled in his fishing boat, beguiled by the humming wave-song beneath him.\n\nJust as Harjo reclined in his small boat and the sea was vaporously exhaling its mist, dark shadows appeared to sluggishly haul themselves across his lazy vision. They hulked and groaned in the distance, growing larger by the second. Quickly awakening from his dozy rest, Harjo scampered from what now appeared in the once-clear waters - dozens of steel giants; IJN warships armed to the teeth, honking deep and booming horns that shook him to the core and caused his vessel to shudder. The great metal monsters cut through the waters and dwarfed Harjo's fragile boat, rushing closer in his path. He clambered to start his motor, pulling with a sweaty haste, glancing back up at the warships crashing in his direction every few seconds. The sleek paint and metal shape of the ships were pillars in the ocean; great monoliths of imperial strength. Piercing through the shrouds of mist, they loomed over him and cut through the foamy waters at lightning speeds. Finally, the motor coughed into action, and Harjo scurried towards the coastline at an animal pace. The warships, still charging in a steel blockade, honked once more, shaking his every bone and shuddering him as they rushed further into Indonesian waters. He fought against the waters that once calmed him, bouncing off of the smallest of waves in a fearful dash to the shore. The thundering blast of the naval horn had cleaved any sense of safety he had in those waters, and carved the adrenal awe of wartime fear into his callow heart."

 japindonesiawar.6.d:0 "Rain pummeled down on the dark jungles of Borneo as a detachment of SNLF troops closed in around a secret Free Indonesian militia encampment. The downpours hammered against jungle leaves and the sky grumbled with a thick and misty thunder. The tumbling growls of the dark sky were lit with strikes of electric-white lightning that momentarily revealed the position of the stalking Japanese marines, but did not grasp the attention of the oblivious men ahead. The Indonesian militias were located at the bottom of a small valley; their encampment consisted of half a dozen tents surrounding a weak fire. Most of the militia men were scattered around the encampment smoking cigarettes, playing card games, or watching the weather in the distance - not prepared for the enemy, nevermind the team of Japanese marines approaching their camp. They were docile and passive, unaware of the slowly creeping SNLF hunters stalking them.\n\nThe Japanese troops silently gathered into small groups and coordinated an attack. There was a moment of radio silence, and then lightning struck. In the cover of a thunderous crack, the rifle teams shot a militiamen on the periphery and dragged his lifeless body into the dense jungle vegetation, moving like shadows in the night. Dressed in a deep and dark green camouflage, the Japanese marines skulked further into the camp, killing the unaware Indonesian fighters in quick succession, spraying their blood on canvas tents with every well-timed deadly shot. The SNLF moved swiftly through the camp, emerging from the shadows and killing more of the unwitting militia men. Thunder continued to erupt through the night, and lighting streaks forked through the distant sky. Torrential rain rushed from above and the remains of the campfire still crackled as it was put out. Amidst the deluge of the jungle's monsoon weather, an odd silence fell on the camp that seemed louder than the crashing rainfall. The marines grouped up after searching the tents, and disappeared into the darkened vegetation, submerging into the night."

Scratches of radio chatter began to buzz over the general commotion of the townspeople below, and Japanese troops began to cock their rifles and prime their weapons as they approached the village. The clicks, crunches, and cracks of ammunition began sharply, and the helicopters became louder as the peasants were in sight. Zooming in droves, the helicopters dawned over the misty horizon, and opened fire on the settlement below as the villagers began to notice the horror in the sky.\n\nThe Japanese approved the order to reign hell upon the village, and once the airborne units were within one hundred yards of the town, they began to decimate the defenseless townsfolk from above. The explosives fired from the helicopters incinerated homes and shelters, melting the flesh off of those unable to escape from the smoldering rubble. Machine gun fire chewed apart the bodies of those unable to outrun the roars of the weapons, cleaving through entire families at a time as they scurried away. Small arms fire picked off those who cowered behind debris, or were not fortunate enough to remain hidden to the besieging IJA aerial assault. The wails and screams of the peasants were not inaudible, but they were drowned out by blasting flames and chopping helicopter blades that had obliterated all that lived on the ground below.\n\nThe helicopters eventually landed, and ground teams began to search for any life still clinging on in the remains of the village. The screams from those still dying were silenced in brutal executions, trophies and photographs were taken from the dead, and mercy often came at the end of a loaded gun."

Constant chatter, clinks of glasses, and groups of cackles filled the room. Some of the men sat in old, brown leather chairs, others stood around high tables smoking cigarettes. The room was dim, but comfortable for those relaxing in it. A few of the officers talked to the young and beautiful women in Djakarta that they had lured into the consulate, intermingling between groups amidst the small crowds. Suharto sat in one of the chairs, taking a sip from his glass, and slowly glanced around the room at the Japanese faces that filled this part of the Indonesian city. Mustering a great strength to approach one of the commanding generals, he lifted himself from the chair and strolled over to begin a conversation.\n\nAwkwardly edging into the group conversation, he forced out a laugh just as the surrounding officers chuckled at a joke made by Ayabe Kitsuju. The men turned to Sukarno, and nodded their heads to acknowledge his presence. Grinning, Suharto nodded back, and turned to the officer to begin his questioning. Repeating banal platitudes and painstakingly gnarly anecdotes, he began on the topic of Japanese involvement in the Indonesian conflict. Requesting that the final stages of the war were left to the central government to conclude with, Suharto pressed Ayabe whilst offering him another glass of water. Ayabe listened diligently, and shaped his eyebrows with a confused intrigue. Suharto, not quite sure how to respond, continued with his proposal of Japanese withdrawal. The two talked for a while longer; the bustle and chatter of the room still bouncing from the walls. They clinked their glasses, and Suharto grinned enough for his eyes to squint with such joy. Ayabe, finished with his water, kept a straight face whilst gazing at the Indonesian leader. The small bubble between the two in the room was suddenly tense, but Suharto had gotten what he wanted."

The local citizenry has never been friendly to the Japanese garrison, but lately, whenever a soldier has bumped into a townsperson, all they've done is yell and scurry off to another corner of the city. The hostility is palpable. The men of the garrison can feel it to the bone: no one is to be trusted here. The only people a man can confide in are the other men of his unit. And so, anxious for the future, the men of the garrison bide their time. They wait for news of something, anything. To settle their nerves, the men gamble in their tents, and the officers drink sake. But, for every friendly laugh, there is tension. Something is coming, and they don't know what.\n\nThat's until the radio operator gets some... interesting news.\n\nSuharto and his men were making moves. It hadn't been authorized by Sukarno or the Japanese government, what was happening?\n\nIn an instant, Jakarta is alive. The rumbling of trucks, the shouting of citizens-made-captains. It's almost like... a military parade. The men of garrison stare in shock, hoping that it's just an exercise, or the pacification of a rebel cell.\n\nIt must be, right?"

It had been a week since he had been summoned to this tropical hell following rumors of instability in the area. He was to watch for suspicious activity amongst the locals, and any signs of American aid coming their way. This meant holing up in a village shack with a tubelight hanging from the ceiling and a single old telephone, far away from civilization. Experience with the INA had taught him to ingratiate himself with locals, especially former soldiers, and most of the actual work of looking for any suspicious activity was done by recruited runners, one of whom the Captain saw running towards him. In something of a panic, he handed over a sheaf of notepapers with names and locations scribbled on them in broken Japanese.\n\nOn the sheet were names of village men who had gone missing in groups when entering the jungle, and whose families were strangely unconcerned. The next few sheets detailed locations where loud noises were reported- rather like gunshots – and as he read through, Captain Kawashima felt a chill run down his back despite the humid heat. This had all the tell-tale signs of rebel organization. It was the last sheet, however, that was the most worrying, a picture of a dinged-up box that had washed ashore. The captain squinted as he struggled to read the text on the side of the box, and then it hit him.\n\nIt was in English, and though caked in mud, he could make out "7.62 MM O.F.N." The Captain rose to his feet, and rang up Kyoto, the next day receiving orders to use his network to infiltrate the rebel groups and gather intel, to be forwarded to the Kenpeitai. A week later, in the dead of midnight, an Australian submarine surfaced near a beach and three boxes floated to waiting rebels. One of them pulled out a revolver, shot their commander, and arrested the others. With a flash, searchlights on board four patrol ships lit up the sea where the submarine was attempting to dive, surrounding the area. Soon after, the Kenpeitai extracted what remained."

 japindonesiawar.11.t:0 "The Tide is Turning"
 japindonesiawar.11.d:0 "How could we have known this little war would cause so much trouble? Everyday, we venture throughout the gloomy jungles and stifling mangroves of the Indonesian inland, and what do we find? They pop from the bushes and the shadows, wielding firepower stronger than any of us could expect. On every island, every time one of us pushes into the understory there's another trap, another dead man who shared our fate, another cabal of those rebel bastards. They charge at us, raving on about our brutality, and the exploitative terror we've brought upon this humid hell of an archipelago.\n\nThe worst part of all this? They, somehow, are technologically superior to us. Us, the masters of Asia, are at the whims of some petty rebellion, a discordant little brother of a people. Our messages are intercepted, troop movements uncovered, and contacting other bases is impossible. What we're wondering, what every Japanese soul on these islands is wondering, is how.\n\nIt didn't take long to figure out. The night of realization was one of rage and rancor. The officers stormed the tents. At first we were scared, then we were pissed. Only a few nations on earth could rival our technology, and only one of them gives a damn about what happens in Indonesia. They've infiltrated us, they've pierced the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken. The only reason Hatta and his band of peasants can do what they can is because of foreign intervention, the tendrils of imperialism are once again breaking through our brotherhood of nations. For each of us dead, for each of us suffering from this broken peace, we all know who to blame."

 japindonesiawar.12.t:0 "Interservice Rivalry in the South Seas"
 japindonesiawar.12.d:0 "Pushing his way through the deck of a patrol vessel was a strange sight, an officer of the Imperial Japanese Army, dressed head to toe in formal attire, as if on a diplomatic mission. The man, one Ueda Yashitake, held nothing but disdain for the navy and those who served it. In his view, it had taken all the glory of WWII, and in that glory, it did nothing but indulge itself on the spoils of victory. Indonesia was at war, and they couldn't even be bothered to protect one of Japan's brotherly nations from the imperialistic tendrils of American money and firepower. Stomping on the grimy deck, he pushed past sailors lifting up a fishing net and men dragging around a cargo container, until he reached a small cabin hidden in the steel and steam of the patrol boat. He peered inside and saw what he was looking for, a table surrounded by local commanders of the Imperial Japanese Navy, meant to be overseeing the waters around Indonesia's east.\n\nUeda claimed their attention in an instant, shouting "What are you people doing? American men and supplies are flowing into Port Moseby, piercing into the heart of our brotherhood of nations, and you people are sitting here doing what exactly?"\n\nThe admirals didn't respond to his accusations, but one whispered to another "one of the army's men, surely..."\n\nUeda twitched in anger, but just as he was about to continue his ravings, his pager buzzed. He turned around for a quick leave, hitting his head on a broken pipe hanging over the doorway on his way out. The admirals, tense but amused, turned back to each other. One remarked "he doesn't understand... we have no side in this fight, it doesn't matter if the Americans want to waste their resources supporting one despot over another." Another, putting his hands together and leaning forward responded "but, he does have a point. The more money the Americans dump on Hatta, the more influence they have over him. We cannot let them pierce our alliance." Over the hissing of steam below them, a senior admiral at the table, a mentor figure to the rest, spoke up to gave his opinion:"

 japindonesiawar.13.t:0 "Operations In The Coral Sea"
 japindonesiawar.13.d:0 "Ueda, standing present on the bow of the patrol vessel, watched the horizon. The white, frothing waves the boat formed as it cut through the ocean exhilarated him, so much so that he wasn't even mad when a stream of seaspray crashed into his suit. Those admirals, warlords of the sea, had agreed with his verdict after much wrangling, and much shouting in the depths of the ship. The wind cracked against the keel, and dark clouds grew overhead. The patrol vessel was to continue on its route before dropping him at his destination, and in truth, he was filled with boyish glee at the thought of feeling the raucous power and awe of the empire's riders of the tide. His bout of ethereal delusions of grandeur were cut short by the sight of an object on the waves, a boat not of the empire's colors. Ueda couldn't believe his luck, they had found one, and Ueda was here to witness it.\n\nAfter several minutes of silence, the ships communicating with each other, the Japanese patrol vessel gently sailed up to the foreign craft. As expected, it was an American transport, disguised as a civilian ship, loaded with fuel, food, munitions, radios, and a few advisors. Sickening, sickening, sickening. The Pacific is a Japanese lake, and these decadent fools won't accept it as such. The ships sat next to each other, the cyclonic waves churning underneath. The Japanese sailors stared at the American ones, some with amusement on their faces, some with disgust, Ueda's expression was one of hatred.\n\nThe Japanese seamen boarded the American transport, taking prisoner the sailors on board and confiscating the materiel hidden in the transport's confines. Ueda boarded the transport himself, grasping one sailor by the shoulder and dragging him to the nearest radio. The Americans would know, the Americans would know that they would no longer be tolerated. Their ships will be torn from the waves, their sailors locked away as war prisoners. Blood will rule the waves for anyone who does not bow to the rising sun, he whispered to himself as he flicked the device on."
 japindonesiawar.13.a:0 "The army was right all along!"

 japindonesiawar.14.t:0 "Business As Usual"
 japindonesiawar.14.d:0 " Ueda leaned over the patrol vessel's railing, staring into the turquoise waves of the Solomon Sea. For hours, he had shouted at that table of admirals, sweat drenching his face and dehydration taking his body. The heat of the ship's depths was nothing to scoff at. After the shouting match, he relented, a headache now burrowed into his skull. He left the admirals to their machinations. Now, he sits, impotent to stop the American menace from intruding upon the authority of the Dai Tōa Kyōei Ken.\n\nStaring into the cyclonic tide, he felt a sense of relaxation sweep over him. Perhaps, it wouldn't be so bad. Hatta could have his American guns and money, as long as he stayed in the Sphere, something which, from all accounts, he intends on doing. Passing by the coast of New Guinea, he saw the lush mangroves of Indonesia. A beautiful archipelago, despite the complaints of heat and humidity from the garrisons.\n\nPassing beyond a coastal village, Ueda stared into its courtyard. There was no one. The houses were emptied and the people gone. From the jungle, Ueda saw sparks. Cracks against the afternoon air. Gunshots. Executions. Ueda was no amauteur when it came to the brutality of warfare, but he knew this to be no fire fight. The entire town was being executed, a tactic familiar to Ueda as a form of reprisal for supporting rebel movements. But, this was no China. Entire towns were being killed for supporting one bastard over another. What did death mean in a land where loyalty was pointless. Sukarno, with the government behind him, would massacre his way across Indonesia. Hatta, with the backing of the Americans, would return the pain and terror twofold. A red moon was rising, and under it, Indonesia would bleed."

 japindonesiawar.15.d:0 "Who ever said Jayapura was dangerous? If they did, they lied. The breeze is gentle, and the lights on the horizon are warm. The consulates are wide open, a testament to a stable land in prosperity. Indonesian culture is on display, restaurants serving Indonesian cuisine and shops providing goods for a healthy local economy. At least, that's what Colin Gardner, a journalist-turned-agent of the CIA found as he walked around the city. Wearing a beige fedora, sunglasses, and a tacky tourist outfit, he roamed the streets of Jayapura, taking photos every step of the way. Slipping into a harbor-side café, he ordered himself a coffee, and sat next to the café window to take in the view. Just then, someone, dressed as an officer of the local Japanese garrison, one "Mr. Kansatsu" entered and took a seat across from Gardner.\n\n"I hope I'm not bothering you. I just needed to rest my legs."\n\nLooking relaxed, Gardner smiled and responded "no problem with that. Company is nice anyway." This was not a battle of guns and power, but one of mental strength. Working for the intelligence services of their respective countries, both Kansatsu and Gardner were happy to be familiarized with a member of the opposing country. Gardner spoke up again, "I'm a journalist, I cover stories around the world in war-torn countries for whichever news agency wants them. Although, after inspection, this place doesn't seem too "war-torn" to me... Actually, since you're Japanese, and you speak english, you wouldn't mind giving me an interview later, would you?"\n\n"Of course not, Mr...?"\n\n"Gardner. Colin Gardner." Gardner slipped Kansatsu his business card, and then the coffee arrived. The coffee was robust and acidic, if not a bit stale after a long shipment in from Sulawesi. Neither Gardner nor Kansatsu could contain their excitement, even from this small interaction, they knew they would become acquaintances. The sun was setting, and there were smiles all around."

 japindonesiawar.16.d:0 "Kawanishi Z1K planes rumbled across the baby-blue sky, with great engines buzzing above the light clouds and thundered a great grumble into the grounds below. The shuddering hum that rippled across the sky was audible across the Sumatran isles, great mounds of paper fell from the gaseous trail of the bombers; they floated and danced through the air as they plummeted below and penetrated the thick jungle climate.\n\nA young man was wading through the thick forested overpasses of the island, avoiding routes plagued with conflict and violence. He came to a clearing where his town was located and took a deep breath of the cooler air. His lungs were filled with a fresh rejuvenation as his chest expanded beyond the prickling constrictive heat that hung below the canopy of the jungles. As he marched over, he noticed his neighbors had scrounged up dozens of the leaflets scattered across the village. Wiping sweat from his tired brow, he waddled over and reached for one that rested neatly in the dry mud in the road.\n\nBranded with the seal of the Indonesian Government, the leaflets had a list of phrases printed across them in bold letters. They read "Sukarno is the father of the nation," and "fight just as you fought before - for the nation!" as well as having a sizable portrait of the President in the bottom right corner. He wiped his nose and continued to read the document as the planes blasted across the sky, fascinated and convinced by it's words of patriotism and service. The young man shared the leaflets with his family and neighbors, to which many of them raised their eyebrows and nodded in enlightened approval."

Aware of his usefulness to Takagi's government, Kouichi Kido utilizes his cunning craft and years of experience to work his way around draconian legislature so that he may achieve the goals he shares with the Prime Minister.

JAP_star_spangled_eyes_desc:0 "Security forces on Papua, after a series of deadly attacks, have located a cache of equipment deep within the jungle. Truckloads of weaponry and a small radio tower confirm our worst suspicions; the Papuans are getting outside help. The Kenpeitai must be dispatched immediately, and harsh measures will need to be enacted to root out these guerillas."

JAP_the_silent_war_desc:0 "Every day the situation in Papua becomes more tense. Ambushes led by CIA trained Papuans block the jungle roads, and operations in the foothills blow American built bases to smithereens. Kempeitai agents are on high alert for their Western opponents. We must pour as many intelligence officers and Kempeitai into Papua to stop the CIA and their rebels."

JAP_sukarno_pr_makeover_desc:0 "Sukarno's reputation among the Indonesian populace had been rough for years, but his fiasco has killed nearly any support for him and his current administration. He now turns to us for help, in an attempt to salvage what's left of his crumbling popularity.\n\nMedia is an effective tool in turning around one's public appeal, and so we shall assist him on that front. Propaganda leaflets shall be distributed to all possible areas, and the press shall be coerced into formulating pro-Sukarno pieces. With these measures in hand, perhaps the people will regain some confidence for Sukarno and his presidency."

JAP_as_expected_desc:0 "Reports from the frontline show that Sukarno's faction are invigorated after their victory at Surabaya and contain the potential to quickly end the civil war if supported by a stronger force. With these observations in mind, it has been decided that the military will intervene on Sukarno's behalf by deploying all available forces to assist him.\n\nSuch an operation includes the land forces working in tandem with Sukarno's troops alongside with the navy and air force to blockade supply ports and bombard enemy positions. Alongside that, equipment such as guns, artillery, and motorized vehicles will be supplied to replenish and bolster the strength of Sakurno's force. With these measures in place, we may be able to press Sukarno's advantage and crush the insurgents swiftly."

We will begin movements of Imperial Navy groups to the Java Sea and the island straits to protect our own ships from the conflict. With enough warships, we could deter some of the FRI's forces from travelling by sea, and keep them out of nearby island chains."

General Suharto now requests a meeting with the IJA command to plan the final campaigns of the war."
