 ### Leaders ### 
 POLITICS_JOZEF_TISO_DESC:0 "로마 가톨릭 신부이자 슬로바키아 제1공화국의 대통령인 요제프 티소 박사의 일생은 성공적이었습니다. 가톨릭 교회로부터 사제 서품을 받은 뒤로 그는 온건파 정치인으로서 성공가도를 달렸습니다. 그는 희망에 차 있는 선량한 인물이었지만, 1930년대 중반에 이르러 티소는 권위주의적이고 전체주의적인 사상에 빠지게 되었고, 슬로바키아 정치계에서 급진적인 인물이 되었습니다. 그 후, 나치가 체코슬로바키아를 점령했을 때, 요제프 티소 박사는 슬로바키아 제1공화국의 대통령으로 임명되었습니다. 티소는 자신의 국민들을 배신하고 총통을 추종하기 시작했습니다.\n\n2차 세계 대전에서 추축국이 승리한 후, 유럽은 짧은 기간 동안 번영했고, 그 후 10년 동안의 불안정이 찾아왔습니다. 독일의 경제 붕괴로 슬로바키아 경제는 몰락했지만, 슬로바키아 정부는 살아남았습니다. 티소 대통령은 국가의 불안정을 잠재울 목적으로 국민들을 더욱 탄압하고 있습니다.\n\n1962년, 티소 대통령의 건강은 급속히 악화되었고 개선될 기미가 보이지 않고 있습니다. 그의 건강이 악화되면서 많은 정부 요인들은 다가올 그의 죽음과 뒤이을 혼란에 대비하고 있습니다."
 POLITICS_STEFAN_TISO_DESC:0 "Though his origins are humble, Štefan Tiso now stands in the center of Slovak politics. Born in the Slovak hinterlands, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army during WW1 and later joined the Czechoslovak Legion, returning to his newly independent country in 1920. Later, he became a member of the HSLS, though he endured some criticism within the heavily anti-semitic party, as his wife was Jewish. Tiso earned his Law Doctorate at the Komenského University in Bratislava, became a judge in Trenčín, and eventually was transferred back to Bratislava and became a member of the National Court.\n\nAs the Axis achieved victory in the Second World War and Slovakia was separated from Czechia, Tiso's party, the HSLS, came into power in the First Slovak Republic. He became Chairman of the National Court, where he remained until 1944 when he replaced Vojtech Tuka as Prime Minister due to his failing health. Tiso also held the offices of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice simultaneously. As PM and foreign minister, he oversaw Slovakia's entry into the Einheitspakt upon its founding.\n\nŠtefan Tiso is now President of the Slovak state, succeeding his distant cousin Jozef Tiso upon his death. While his rule has remained stable, there are rumors of disgruntlement amongst the military. He is also directly opposed by the more radical wing of the HSLS, including those who seek closer cooperation with Germany, such as Alexander Mach."
 POLITICS_JAN_GOLIAN_DESC:0 "Placeholder"
 POLITICS_FRIEDRICH_FOERTSCH_DESC:0 "Friedrich Albert Foertsch, a son of Franconian farmers, has been committed to the German nationalist ideas even since he volunteered to serve in the Imperial German Army during WWI and later joined the Freikorps during the turbulent period of 1920 to combat the Bolshevik threat. Unwanted by the Weimar Republic, Foertsch again found his place in the military after Hitler's rise to power and built his career from a major to a general on the battlefields of France and the Soviet Union. A staunch believer in the might of the German war machine, Foersch wisely chose to side with Hermann Göring during the power struggle that happened after Hitler's death, securing his position in the Wehrmacht after the end of the civil war.\n\nFor his faithful service to the Fatherland and his closeness to the new Führer, Foertsch was granted with the territories of the Reichskommissariat Slowakei to govern it as its sole ruler. The previous native government proved itself to be incapable for responsible and competent reigning over their own kin and thus it became necessary to establish a stronger German presence to keep the rebellious Slovak population in line with the National Socialist directive and to keep their pathetic state useful for the Reich. Pacifying the disloyal populace and strengthening the German grip over those lands is a heavy task, but isn't one that a venerable Wehrmacht general can't handle."

 ### Ideas ###
 SLO_tiso_dead:0 "Death of Tiso"
 SLO_tiso_dead_desc:0 "With Tiso's death the country has been thrown into chaos. The goverment is compleatly paralyzed and the people, starting to realise this, are demanding change. We must act fast to stop any further instability."
 SLO_Chained_Minds:0 "Chained Minds"
 SLO_Chained_Minds_desc:0 "To nobody's wonder, free expression of opinion isn't allowed in Slovakia. While some may argue that free speech is undermining goverment stability, and thus it's disallowance is fundamental to a functioning state, people aren't very happy about it, as aren't the thinkers."
 SLO_Political_Tensions:0 "Political Tensions"
 SLO_Political_Tensions_desc:0 "While Tiso has been our undisputed leader for over 20 years, his health has been declining, as it always does. This, of course, means that everyone involved in Slovakian politics have started vying for power, in all forms possible. And if it wasn't enough, reports about zero resistance activity are appearing to be false..."
 SLO_Agitated_Workers:0 "Agitated Workers"
 SLO_Agitated_Workers_desc:0 "While the Republic has been doing quite fine the past few decades, problems still haunt her, such as the workers. Be it low wages, poor working conditions, or just a general disagreement with the goverment, the workers are on constant strikes."
 SLO_Uncompetitive_Economy:0 "Uncompetitive Economy"
 SLO_Uncompetitive_Economy_desc:0 "Fascism, as it would appear, has not been the kindest to our economy. This should be resolved, if we are to not suffer a complete economic breakdown."

Rejoin the Pakt, and be allowed to stay in power."
