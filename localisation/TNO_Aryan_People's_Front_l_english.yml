 POLITICS_Konrad_Henlein_DESC:0 "In the mountains of the Sudetenland, a man once politically left for dead rises back to the top- and yet, he still finds himself dancing on the strings of his master.\n\nKonrad Henlein has struggled greatly in the last few decades. An ardent Sudeten-German Nazi, not so much a fiery populist as an ordinary everyman, Henlein officially joined the Party after the occupation in 1938, and was soon appointed Reichstaathalter of the Sudetenland. It was here where his fateful rivalry with Heydrich began- a rivalry which he would eventually come out the loser, passed over for promotion after promotion as Heydrich ascended higher and higher. For years Henlein toiled, never getting that promotion to Gauleiter he always coveted, watching as Heydrich rose to leader of the German-SS- and then Führer.\n\nEven so, perhaps Henlein would have still worked with Heydrich against Himmler in the split- had Heydrich not completely passed over his head with plans, leaving him in the dark. The last straw having broken, Henlein turned his gaze to Burgundy- but they showed little interest in courting him either. Therefore, Henlein has concluded his only path is to grow as radical as he can, reviving the old ideas of Lebensraum and Lebensborn, forcing mandatory training and drills- all in an attempt to exude Aryan qualities from his lands, making him as appealing to the Reichsfuhrer as possible.\n\nHenlein prepares his men for war- for he knows this is the only shot he may ever have to get that promotion he's been aching for for so long."

 APF_lebensborn_desc:0 "Gauleiter Henlein's obsession with Aryan qualities and the Aryan race has brought him to reinstate the Lebensborn program of days of old. Believing that from his self proclaimed Gauleitung, he can set a shining example of racial purity that the Reichsführer-SS shall surely smile upon.\n\nYet this Lebensborn program is not the result of years of state planning. Rather, it has been hastily assembled, with women deemed Aryan being hastily "selected" for their participation in it."
