 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_DESC:0 "Nazism has always relied primarily on two things: nationalistic sympathies towards one's own nation, and a central strongman smart enough to trample his enemies in the political game and sway the masses. None of Hitler's potential successors embodied this more than Martin Bormann; who learned closely from The Führer in his time as his secretary and strives to emulate him in every way. In doing so; Bormann has honed in on the nationalistic sentiments of the population to convince them that he is the only man in the Reich able to keep them safe and their nation secure. Often calling himself the 'Second Hitler' to cheering masses as he fed them exactly what they wanted.\n\nThe political arena has proven to be less of a battlefield and more of a shooting gallery to Bormann as well. While Bormann oft paints himself as an anti-intellectual and a simpler man to the masses, in the Reichstag he has proven himself to be a fierce negotiator, power player and deceiver to many. While Germany is divided between himself and the others who dared fight him, the Reichstag has always been firmly under his boot. Truly, if politics could win wars, then Bormann would have long ago conquered the world."
 POLITICS_MARTIN_BORMANN_FUCK_DESC:0 "The Brown Kaiser sits on his bloody throne in the heart of Germania as the Party fawns before him. His opponents are dead. The Reformists, the Militarists, the dissident Conservatives – all have been extinguished. The institutions that threatened his rule have been annihilated. Bormann is Germany, and Germany is Bormann.\n\nYet the clockwork of the bureaucratic apparatus grows rusty and stiff. His Party comrades gaze at him not with respect or love, but pure fear. Mass protests, violent riots and deadly terrorist attacks have seized the nation and refused to let go. The threat to the east looms ever larger, and the recent cancer diagnosis raises the grim question:\n\nWho will succeed the Führer?"

 # Civil War Events #
 ####################
 bormann.0.t: "The Political Rodeo"
 bormann.0.desc: "With the horrors of the Bürgerkrieg behind us, the Führer had dared to hope for some semblance of order and stability to return to the Reich. Unfortunately, it seems that this is barely the case. Though the remnants of the traitor Göring's forces were reintegrated to the Reich, thanks to the mercy of the Führer, some, Schörner chief among them, still push their agendas, and they are not alone. The remnants of the traitor Speer's clique still agitate the youth, ranting and raving about reforms and liberalization.\n\nReforms will happen, but not as Speer envisioned them. The Reich will not sink into the depravity it has fought so hard against, but instead will rise from the ashes of recent memory like a phoenix. Efforts to re-educate dissidents have already begun, and reintegration efforts, personally ordered by the Führer, make rapid progress in ensuring that the legacy of Adolf Hitler, forgotten by the rebels, is the Reich's only philosophy.\n\nThe Heer has already been deployed to key areas to ensure further stability, and the Führer works around the clock to reform the slave system to something more economically sound. Our Reichskomissiariats will be brought back into the fold, as the Führer has promised time and again, and the native revolts will be swiftly put down.\n\nAs for those who doubt the Führer, who wonder how things would be if another sat in the Reichstag, they will be dealt with swiftly. The Führer, with his characteristic political savvy, has already begun to work at chipping away the foundations of treasonous institutions and replacing them with loyal National Socialists. The Heer will be brought in line, and the students will learn to see reason.\n\nAnd when the work is done, the Reich will stand above all enemies, and the Führer will deliver unto the world the glory of true National Socialism."
 bormann.0.a: "하일 보어만!"
 bormann.0.a_tt: "§YThe House of Cards is now available.§!\n§g-----------------§!\n§RTo secure§! §YControl§! §Rof Germany we must work to secure the §Yloyalty§! of the various demographics and interest groups within Germany, either that or limit the §Ypower§! of those we cannot control. It is only by dominating this§! §YHouse of Cards§! §Rthat we may maintain stability in the Reich and purge our enemies.§!"

 bormann.1.t:0 "Bormann is Victorious"
 bormann.1.desc:0 "Bormann rode in triumph through the remains of Germania today towards the Volkshalle as bands played Das Rheingold and crowds cheered his arrival, waving the Reich's banner on every corner. An honor guard received him there, where the nation's new Führer quickly began announcing his plans for his new order.\n\nIn his speech, Bormann emphasized that his right to rule has been established already, not in the flames of the German Civil War but in the victories and accomplishments of the Reich in WWII. As the rightful continuation of the German governmnent, he now rules an order built up by the sweat and toil of Germans decades before, and saved and brought into the next decade by the sweat and toil of Germans now.\n\nInternationally the response is mute, as the United States and Japan both dig their feet in and prepare for more of the same from Germany."
 bormann.1.a:0 "At last the Reich is ours!"
 
 bormann.2.t:0 "The Germania Corridor"
 bormann.2.desc:0 "The war drags on, and sees no sign of ending. Many worry the Civil War is approaching a new stage: absolute anarchy.\n\nWith no central authority and the fatherland being devoured by its children, the various pretender states are losing their ability to supply their cities, and famine has begun to spread across the devestated country. One thing is clear, the war needs to end, and soon.\n\nThe Generals are calling it the Germania corridor. The city has been highly militarized by Speidel and his men and won't be an easy fight to win, but if we were able to overwhelm him and his defenses and break through the other side, it could be enough of a push to swing the war in our favor, as well as secure us the prestige of winning back the city.\n\nOf course, Speidel will be a difficult egg to crack, but if we don't do it, surely someone else will try it soon."
 bormann.2.a:0 "We march on Germania!"
 bormann.2.b:0 "We will be crowned in peace."
 
 bormann.3.t:0 "Anarchy Reigns"
 bormann.3.desc:0 "The war has dragged on, famine has begun spreading across the cities as food and water has become a harder found resource than any other. The men are all gone, dead or dying by choice or by force on the battlefield. Millions are dead, and the major cities of Germany have been absolutely wiped out, none free from some form of devestation or another. As more and more of the little remaining infastructure becomes victim to various war efforts, food and supplies no longer move around, and the famine only gets worse, disease quickly following along with it.\n\nThis is the true beginning of what people are calling the German Anarchy, and the worst has yet to come."
 bormann.3.a:0 "Rocks fall everyone dies."
 
 bormann.4.t:0 "Bormann Ordering Nuclear Strikes"
 bormann.4.desc:0 "In a move that will surely shock not only international observers, or even our enemies, but also our native people, Bormann has decided, in a desperate move to take down his enemies, to officially launch nuclear missiles.\n\nThis comes as a shock to international observers around the world, due to the ongoing stalemate that belligerent nations have been embroiled in for the past few decades. A nuclear launch into any nation could threaten to tear apart alliances, nations themselves, and even the current world order. This will, no doubt, have far reaching consequences that will leave no nation, or person, untouched..."
 bormann.4.a:0 "Fire away!"
 
 bormann.5.t:0 "Victory Almost Assured"
 bormann.5.desc:0 "The Fatherland stands in triumph! Speer and his dirty rats have been sent running, Göring and his revisionists stands destroyed, and Himmler's puppet Heydrich was sent to his accursed Burgundy! However, the War is not over yet - Germany has one more hurdle before it can return to the greatness it always had - that would be Speidel, and his Germanian defence force. By a miracle of God, our Welthauptstadt Germania has remained relatively unharmed by the war, and its inhabitants hail Speidel and his former commander, Erwin Rommel, as heroes for saving the beautiful landmarks of Germany.\n\nThe final step to reuniting Germany and returning to glory is to have Speidel make his guards stand down and let us enter Germania. Yet Speidel is in control of his army, and it is up to him to make the choice for it to bow to us."
 bormann.5.a:0 "We stand victorious!"
 
 bormann.6.t:0 "Speidel Surrenders Germania!"
 bormann.6.desc:0 "The wounded Germany that we inhibited has been marked with tension in the past days while Speidel contemplated his response to our request of putting his forces on stand-down orders. However, the entire nation took a sigh of relief and joy when Speidel and Rommel announced that their divisions would stand down for the first time since Germany engulfed itself in internal conflict, and allow Bormann's forces to enter Germania peacefully. As church bells rang across Bavaria and beers were passed out to impromptu crowds in Germanian pubs and beer halls, it seemed no place in the Reich did not do something to celebrate the end of the harrowing civil war that claimed so much German blood."
 bormann.6.a:0 "May the Reich prosper for one thousand years!"
 
 bormann.7.t:0 "Germania Decides to Fight!"
 bormann.7.desc:0 "Even though the last desperate holdouts continue to wage war on our army, we have considered ourselves victorious and turned our eyes to the last step to the much-needed reunification of the Fatherland - Speidel's Germania. As all of Germany simultaneously held its breath, Speidel decided the fate of Germania. The breath of the Fatherland was interrupted, however, with a punch to the stomach - Speidel has declared Germania will not stand down to Bormann and has ordered Germania to prepare for 'the final battle' with us. Such a battle does not look good for Germania - much of the Welthauptstadt is predicted to be destroyed in the fighting - and our citizens look on in horror. Although we are victorious, the olive dove has not rested just yet, and a final, decisive struggle must now begin for the fate of the nation we paid for so dearly in souls."
 bormann.7.a:0 "We will crush that 'general' into dust!" 

 bormann.8.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 bormann.8.d:0 "Unexpected news has reached us from Northern Germany today. It seems that the reformist liberals, led by the traitor Albert Speer, have approached us with an offer of ceasefire. Unfortunately, this is not because they wish to join our cause- rather, it is because a threat greater in their eyes than our faction has popped up.\n\nReinhard Heydrich, unquestionably one of the worst men in all of the Reich, has been steadily gaining power and influence while the other factions have fought with each other. He is now powerful enough to be a recognizable threat, on par with Goring and Speer. This has worried the Speerites, who are now approaching us with an offer to put aside our differences and destroy the common threat- that of the SS and their foul Burgundian System.\n\nOf course, it's a common belief among our soldiers that we could easily deal with SS rabble without the help of some student militias, but the freed up soldiers would certainly be quite the help in crushing this menace once and for all. It is our decision to make."
 bormann.8.a:0 "A ceasefire is appropriate."
 bormann.8.b:0 "We don't need their help."

 bormann.9.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 bormann.9.d:0 "Four men entered the battle for Germany's future, but most only thought there were three true contenders- Bormann, Goring, and Speer. The fourth, Heydrich, was widely seen as nothing more than a doomed breakaway, with no public support, little Heer support, and disconnected territory. Most discarded his candidacy from the start- certainly someone would crush him fast, and the nightmare would be over.\n\nUnfortunately, events have not gone the way we have expected. Heydrich is quickly gaining speed and momentum, and most recognize him as a real threat to take over Germany, despite the resistance of most of the people. As much as we hate our fellow competitors, we can all agree- Heydrich cannot be allowed to take control of the Reich, for he will certainly bring nothing but death and destruction to it.\n\nAs such, we have invited our challengers to a conference to negotiate a temporary "Anti-Heydrich Pact"- built not as a perfect solution to the Burgerkrieg, but as a means to stop Heydrich before he becomes too powerful for us to contain."
 bormann.9.a:0 "We must come together, or we will die."
 bormann.9.b:0 "We will never work with traitors!"
 
 bormann.10.t:0 "Goring Refuses"
 bormann.10.d:0 "Disappointingly, it seems that Goring's ego has won out over his brain. In an unsurprising, yet shockingly irritating message, Goring has refused to enter in a ceasefire with our faction, claiming that his Heer is more than sufficient to do the job. While not exactly an unexpected response from the famously aggressive man, it's a setback.\n\nWhile we are confident in the ability of our forces to defeat Heydrich and send him packing, it certainly would have been simpler if we could concentrate all of our forces on their frontline."
 bormann.10.a:0 " Can we truly agree on nothing?"

 bormann.11.t:0 "The Dutch send volunteers"
 bormann.11.d:0 "Now that the dust has settled in the RK Niederlande and Van Geelkerken is in charge, the new Dutch government has decided to gather and train a division of volunteers to send us."
 bormann.11.a:0 "Our thanks to the Dutch"
 
 bormann.12.t:0 "The Germania Corridor?"
 bormann.12.d:0 "Placeholder"
 bormann.12.a:0 "We march on Germania!"
 bormann.12.b:0 "We will be crowned in peace"
 
 bormann.13.t:0 "Escalate the conflict with Speidel?"
 bormann.13.d:0 "Placeholder"
 bormann.13.a:0 "Yes"
 bormann.13.b:0 "Just take more territory"
 bormann.13.c:0 "Maybe later"
 
 bormann.14.t:0 "Make a move on Germania?"
 bormann.14.d:0 "Placeholder"
 bormann.14.a:0 "Quickly! To Germania!"
 bormann.14.b:0 "This is not in our interest."
 
 bormann.15.t:0 "The Scramble for Germania"
 bormann.15.d:0 "Placeholder"
 bormann.15.a:0 "Quickly! To Germania!"
 bormann.15.b:0 "This is not in our interest."
 
 bormann.16.t:0 "The Obvious Outcome"
 bormann.16.d:0 "Earlier today, the city of Germania was finally taken by the 'rightful' heir of the late Adolf Hitler, Martin Bormann. Nothing short of 'predetermined destiny' being the reason for this capture has become the official party line. Whilst the other contenders may claim to be the true successor to our beloved late Führer, the fact is they simply are not, for how else would Bormann have achieved what they could not?\n\nHans Speidel, despite opposing us in Germania, was surely just mislead we are certain, and even he will be released from custody after this war has drawn to a close, courtesy of the personal intervention of Bormann of course. It is only a matter of time now before Germany is reunited and guided as a steady ship, for we do not need the reforms of Speer, the Spartanism of Heydrich, or the overzealous militarism of Göring; all we need is Martin Bormann, who we know will keep us on the truest path of what Hitler has left us with."
 bormann.16.a:0 "Guided to Victory!"

 bormann.26.t: "The Question of Slavery"
 bormann.26.desc: "The issue of slavery has long plagued the Reich. It is indubitable that the German is the master of Europe, and the Slav little more than a backwards animal; for these subhumans to toil at the behest of their Aryan conquerors is the natural outcome for Europe, as dictated by basic biology. Nonetheless, we must admit that slavery's impact on the economy has not necessarily been a positive one. The disgusting filth spewed by the traitor Speer, while being a total betrayal of National Socialism itself, may have held within a small nugget of truth. The overreliance on slaves has not helped the problem of unemployment among the lower classes, and boosting employment with unprofitable vanity projects may simply delay our economic issues. On average, the German man and woman are spending less and less as consumers, leading to some fears that the system of slavery as it stands could lead to the collapse of the German economy itself.\n\nThe Reich must make a stark choice regarding the status of slavery. As many conservatives within the Party are suggesting, the slave camps that were destroyed during the Bürgerkrieg should be rebuilt, and the Slavs kicked back to work. However, perhaps a more sensible compromise would be to halt the system of slavery and instead transfer these mongrels to isolated city ghettoes."
 bormann.26.a: "Send them to the ghettoes."
 bormann.26.b: "Compromise is for cowards. The slave camps must be rebuilt!"
 bormann.27.t: "Our Most Dangerous Issue"
 bormann.27.desc: "The Bürgerkrieg ripped the Fatherland apart limb from limb, and despite the Führer's selfless efforts to stitch the fractured remnants of the Reich back together, there are some wounds that still fester. If they are not treated soon, the body of the Reich will atrophy, and we may collapse into chaos yet again.\n\nThe men of the Wehrmacht may have sworn their oaths of loyalty towards the new Führer, but not all have sought to align themselves fully behind his wisdom. A faction of military reformists has coalesced around Hans Speidel, advocating for the total reinvigoration of the Wehrmacht, including a complete overhaul of military strategies and a professional, reduced draft. On the other end of the spectrum, Ferdinand Schörner has rallied his band of militarists, sabre-rattlers who desire an increased draft and a political role for the Wehrmacht.\n\nWhile Bormann would sooner trust a Swiss banker than these uniformed weasels, the Reich's wounds can only be healed with the support of one of these two influential factions. The clock is counting down, and the time draws near for the Führer to grit his teeth and do a deal with the devil."
 bormann.27.a: "But which devil?"
 #THE SHOWDOWN
 bormann.28.t: "A Meeting with the Wehrmacht's Leaders"
 bormann.28.desc: "Martin Bormann rubbed his eyes with a deep sigh. The days seemed to stretch out longer as the weeks went by. There were moments - fleeting, insignificant - when he imagined himself retiring to bed early in the evening, released of the crushing burden of preserving the Reich. He stared at the moonlight streaming in through the window, pooling across the floor towards his large oaken desk. When was the last time he had appreciated something as simple as a ray of moonlight?\n\n"Heil Bormann." The sleepy voice snapped him out of his ridiculous thoughts.\n\n"Heil Bormann," Bormann replied gruffly down the phone. "Herr Speidel, you are invited to a private meeting in the Reichskanzlei. I am willing to appoint a new Chief of the OKW if a persuasive case is presented to me. Ferdinand has already agreed to join us." Reluctantly, Bormann thought. Schörner's voice, at first so smug and satisfied at the invitation, had begun to radiate fury the moment Speidel's name was mentioned.\n\n"I understand, my Führer," Speidel's fatigued, mildly confused voice came after a brief pause. "Heil Bormann."\n\nBormann pushed the phone down with a grunt and once more his eyes drifted to the luminescent puddle transforming the ugly pattern of the rug into something surprisingly beautiful. Bormann pushed himself out of the chair, crossed the room, and flicked the light switch on. The moonlight vanished in an instant. He returned to his desk, picked up his pen and began to scribble. There was no time for such childish distractions.\n\nBormann had work to do."
 bormann.28.a: "The Meeting Awaits..."
 bormann.29.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Future Direction"
 bormann.29.desc: ""Enter!" Bormann barked, his gaze firmly fixed on the portrait of himself hanging on the wall. He heard the door open behind him, followed by two overlapping cries of "Heil, my Führer!" Bormann turned around towards the two uniformed officers, bespectacled snakes in the skin of lions.\n\n"Let's avoid the pleasantries, gentleman," Bormann said gruffly. "Sit down. We cannot delay this discussion any further. The Fatherland deserves a strong and stable army to defend its people and preserve its land. As your Führer, it is my duty to listen to your arguments." Bormann sat down in his chair and crossed his arms. "Convince me."\n\n"You have my gratitude for allowing us this opportunity, my Führer," Speidel spoke up, taking his seat at the table. "Only by reinvigorating and adapting the Wehrmacht to modern times can we help launch Germany into a new era of progress. We cannot allow the quagmire of the past to bog down our soldiers in the present. We must explore new tactics and new strategies. We need a total review of the Wehrmacht. Many competent and respected men who desire true reform have attached themselves to my ideals."\n\n"As they did to Speer's," Schörner sneered. "My Führer, is our army not the greatest in the world? Did we not crush the Allies and the Soviet Union? We have the greatest minds behind the greatest strategies, commanding the bravest and most noble of men in the world." Schörner thrust a finger towards Speidel. "This man and his clique of cowards would strip the Wehrmacht down to nothing in the name of 'reform'!"\n\nBormann sighed heavily as the two officers continued their arguing. This was going to be a long meeting..."
 bormann.29.a: "Spiedel is right. We need a total review of the Wehrmacht."
 bormann.29.b: "Schörner's logic is untouchable. Our Wehrmacht is already great!"
 bormann.30.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: Conscription"
 bormann.30.desc: ""Let us move onto our next topic," Bormann said, lighting up his cigar. "Conscription. Where do you stand?"\n\n"As I have already stated, my Führer," Schörner said, pushing his spectacles up his sharp nose, "our army's strategies have proven to be successful; however, an army is nothing without its personnel. The Reich is beset on all sides by threats, from the Jewish capitalists in Washington to the yellow powermongers of the Orient. What if they try to invade us? We cannot allow the fruits of our labour to be snatched away as our feeble Wehrmacht watches on." Schörner jabbed a finger on the table. "We need more conscripts!"\n\n"A bloated army is just as effective as a bloated solider," Speidel waved his hand dismissively. "It'll collapse under its own weight. A reduced draft will tighten our military, and then we can sensibly set about professionalising the Wehrmacht. Professional commanders and professional soldiers, not incompetent yes-men leading scared young cannon fodder. Our priorities should be quality, not quantity. It is necessary, therefore, that the new draft be voluntary - "\n\n"Voluntary?!" Schörner exploded into laughter and slapped the table heartily. "Forgive me, my Führer... but this man is suggesting that we take the honour and glory of battle away from the young men of the Reich! War is what turns us into heroes. Speidel would deprive the right of our citizens to fight alongside each other in favour of... what? A small cluster of so-called professionals?"\n\nBormann drummed his fingers against the table, brow furrowed in thought."
 bormann.30.a: "Speidel speaks the truth. We must prioritise the quality of the army over its quantity."
 bormann.30.b: "Schörner understands the military. A larger army is a mightier army."
 bormann.31.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Role of the Wehrmacht"
 bormann.31.desc: "Bormann rubbed his temples as the two men gestured and shouted. To have been Adolf Hitler in the glory days, surrounded by adulating columns of generals who hung onto his every pearl of wisdom... Watching these uniformed serpents argue who could hiss the loudest and bite the hardest made Bormann's stomach churn.\n\n"Enough!" Bormann snapped, mashing his third cigar into the ashtray. "It is time for us to address our final topic. What political position should the Wehrmacht have in our Greater Reich?"\n\n"It is my belief that the military should be an apolitical force within the Fatherland," Speidel stated. "It is the duty of the Wehrmacht to serve the nation and its people, not to lobby the government, and certainly not to pursue political agendas. If the military considers itself to be an equal to the Party, how long until it decides to become the Party itself?"\n\n"You are spouting lies as usual!" Schörner spat. "You, who would see the Wehrmacht treated as a mere tool, and not an instrumental force within our nation! If the Party is the head of the Reich, the Wehrmacht is its mighty fist: Together, we work in tangent to crush our enemies, but separated we all bleed out. The military should absolutely be political, and a true standard-bearer of National Socialist thought. An apolitical Wehrmacht would become a disloyal Wehrmacht.""
 bormann.31.a: "Speidel is right. The Wehrmacht should serve as an apolitical force."
 bormann.31.b: "Schörner is correct. A political Wehrmacht is one loyal to our cause."
 bormann.32.t: "Meeting in the Reichskanzlei: The Result"
 bormann.32.desc_speidel_victory: ""Silence!" Bormann raised his hand firmly and the two officers ceased their bickering. "I have made my decision. Herr Speidel, you are correct. It is time for true reform within the Wehrmacht to take place. Effective immediately, you will take the position of Chief of the OKW." Speidel allowed himself a satisfied smile and nodded slightly as Schörner's eyes widened in fury and his hands balled into fists.\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Speidel said, "for reaching your open hand out towards those in the Wehrmacht who desire positive change. You have my full support."\n\n"This is outrageous!" Schörner roared, shooting spittle across the table. He leapt up and slammed his fists against the wooden surface. He pointed accusingly at Bormann, drilling into him with burning eyes. "You have just let a traitor into your bed! A secret acolyte of Albert Speer himself!"\n\n"How fucking dare you!" Bormann shot to his feet, grabbed his ashtray and launched it towards the raging officer. Schörner ducked just in time to avoid the projectile. "Remember who you are speaking to, Ferdinand!"\n\n"I know exactly who I'm speaking to." Schörner stiffly brushed cigar ash off of his uniform. The sneer stretched across his face was all but treasonous. "Heil Bormann." With that, he marched out of the room.\n\nSpeidel quickly replaced his shocked face with a grateful one as he strolled over to Bormann with his arm outstretched. The Führer replied with a firm handshake and a forced smile."

"Herr Schörner, your proposals are the only path to a stronger Wehrmacht. Effective immediately, I appoint you Chief of the OKW." Schörner flashed a lopsided grin and jumped to his feet as Speidel slumped further down into his chair with an ashen face.\n\n"This is most... unfortunate," Speidel sighed. He slowly removed his round spectacles and rubbed his eyes. "I fear you have made the wrong decision, my Führer."\n\n"Is it not my decision to make?" Bormann snapped, slamming his fist onto the table. "Watch your fucking tongue!"\n\n"Apologies, my Führer," Speidel replied hastily. He shot a salute into the air. "Heil Bormann." Bormann returned the greeting with a stiff salute, and the officer nodded curtly and marched out of the room.\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Schörner said smugly, swaggering over to Bormann and shaking his hand vigorously. "Your support for the brave officers of the Wehrmacht will not be forgotten soon. Trust me." Schörner's smile stretched further upwards, but it didn't quite reach his icy eyes."

I know you are not the most ardent believer in Party doctrine - this is acceptable. I need someone without scruples, someone who knows how to look out for themselves. Someone pragmatic. The Reich's intelligence services are a mess, such was Hitler's way. He trusted no man with all that information. Well, Hitler was wrong, and it almost killed me.

Protecting the Reich and being kind to it's people were usually polar opposites, for example. It had taken far too many promises to evade the coup, ones he'd really rather not keep.\n\nHe picked up the papers and flicked through them. If there was no proof a promise had been made, it would simply be his word against theirs. And his word was the best in the Reich. He stood from his comfortable chair and surveyed his now-empty office, lit only by smouldering embers.\n\nHe cast the papers into the fireplace, and watched them shrivel and burn."

Even moreso than other Slavs, they were feeble-minded, stubborn and useless for anything more than menial agricultural labor. Why Bormann ever thought they could actually be reasoned with was beyond him now. It had been worth a try, at least, if only to spare a little Aryan blood. That the Poles could not recognise their correct place in the world was no fault of his, though, and so the General Government would be re-established atop the mass grave of the Polish race.

With the army lacking the experienced counterintelligence network necessary to defend itself against us, it would be child's play to infiltrate its command structure and begin funnelling vital intelligence to the Wehrmacht. While some hawks believe they already have all the intel required on the Polish, their successful uprising has raised questions about our previous estimations of their fighting ability. Being able to accurately reassess it could save many German lives.\n\nAlternatively, we could adhere to the Wehrmacht's wishes and target the Polish logistics system, focusing our efforts on sabotage, misdirection and cutting supply lines.

Additionally, recent raids over the border by Polish terrorists - whether they are part of the Home Army, I cannot say - have provided us with concrete evidence of actual crimes. Needless to say, this is more than welcome, despite the loss of German lives involved. Not since the liberation of the Baltic have we possessed more ample evidence of our enemies' atrocities, real or otherwise.\n\nI have taken the liberty of procuring some slaves to provide our Orpo and Landser corpses.

However, by the day's dawn even the administrative center's most embittered cynics could do nothing but be stunned - if not be truly surprised - by the columns of armored vehicles and ranks of soldiers proceeding down the streets towards the city's center. Even though word had not been given directly to the public about their mission, it was obvious to all what the Wehrmacht had come to do.\n\nThe thunder of jetcraft rattled the government headquarters even as riflemen shouted orders at panicking security officers who, in the true spirit of the GGN, had not received warning from their superiors. By the end of the hour, Hans Frank's clique and all attached political officials had been - sometimes forcefully - placed under arrest and evicted from the centers of power in the Generalgouvernment. By the end of the day, NSDAP functionaries and other assorted party members had been installed throughout Krakau as the heads of the new Interinregierung and immediately set to work on their herculean task; dousing the political fires Hans Frank's clique had left to consume the entire administration."

A functionary of the Interinregierung might discover reports detailing a transfer of funds and personnel to a managerial department only for another functionary to find that same department having been consolidated into a completely unrelated bureau whose new records are kept using archiving methods that can only be described as 'labyrinthine'.\n\nThe remnants of the bureaucrats and secretaries of the administration have been less than cooperative as well. This is not due to some personal resistance to assisting our operation, but rather that those individuals know less about the overall picture than even our own functionaries and investigators. It has become torturously clear that the bloated departments of the GGN's administration must be entirely dissolved and reconstructed from the ground up if the region is ever to be brought into line with the basics of governmental standards and accountability, much less function in step with the Reich."

By all measure every last one of them was guilty of high crimes against the Reich and its peoples; embezzlement, fraud, dereliction of duty, even technical treason to the Vaterland, and each carried a very high price to the accused. These charges could not be dismissed, for as much as some in the NSDAP would wish to put the entire failure behind them, the citizens were incensed at the fact that on Germany's very doorstep such a national embarrassment was allowed to transpire at all, much less continue unabated for years.\n\nBormann stood from his desk and strode to the windows, considering the bustling sprawl of Germania and the Reich before him. The accused would be punished, but the question remained to what degree. Should they be subjected to the full purview of the law then the people of the Reich would be relieved and, perhaps most importantly, witness firsthand Bormann weeding out those corrupt officials and thereby cement his commitment to justice. However, there are notable members in the party who would take exception to such drastic punishments to their compatriots, and Bormann's control in the nation is not yet absolute. Inversely, letting the clique off with just a figurative black eye would endear a swath of the party to him and his judgement, though surely the people would not favor such a decision."

Still, if there was one thing the Führer knew above all else, it is that politics has a way of making a decision for you. Of all options, there were three men Bormann considered.\n\nFirst was Eduard Wagner, the man responsible for The Reich's logistics during the Second World War and a notable militarist. The GGN is vital to the Reich logistically, and accordingly Wagner will excel in such a position, though he will have to step down from his military rank to receive it. Second is Theodor Koch, the industrialist of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring company. The GGN has untapped industrial potential and a savvy man like Koch will handle the aforementioned logistics well. Finally, Werner Dollinger, a reformist and famous Bavarian economist, would perform admirably in reconstructing the economic prospects of the GGN itself.\n\nBormann brought the phone to his lips, paused, and came to a decision."

That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel's disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany; Ours!\n\nSeveral aides rushed into our command room moments after the conclusion of Dönitz's broadcast to breathlessly relay this shocking windfall. With Dönitz rallying the undecided commanders of the navy to our side, we could be afforded total control of the seas, not to mention the devastating effect that the denunciations of 'the hero of the Atlantic' will have on what meagre forces remain with the traitors."

Taking to the radio once again in a fiery dictat on the importance of respect for Germany's institutions, Karl Dönitz shocked observers across the world when, midway through the broadcast, he began to read names. Admirals from across the Reich, from every conceivable fleet and theatre, have apparently sent communiques to Theoderichshafen commending Dönitz's actions. His denunciations have evidently hit a chord with much of the German navy, particularly those who had been feeling uneasy about publicly choosing a side in the civil war, offering an apparently 'neutral' face-saving alternative. A fanciful story has even begun to circulate about four sailors from Wilhelmshaven who jumped overboard and swam over a mile to land when the captain announced his support for Albert Speer instead of Dönitz.\n\nWith ships from across the Reich rallying to Dönitz's banner, and therefore, to ours, prospects are looking increasingly dim for the other contenders."

 #Bormann Bohemia Events
 bormann.600.t:0 "Ehre wen Ehre Gebührt"
 bormann.600.desc:0 "The Bohemian garrison had an unenviable position even before the civil war. Despite lying at the heart of the Reich they were plagued by partisans, the Czechs simply refusing to give up in the face of destruction. Ironically this turmoil spared them from involvement in the bitter power struggle of the rest of Germany, and the chaos that overtook the Reich evidently did more harm to the partisans than it did to the garrison. Holding on by tooth and claw, the beleaguered garrison took back the countryside and hunted them down one by one. Now, Bohemia is ready to return to the fold.\n\nFührer Bormann has praised the actions of the loyal soldiers of the Reich cut off from the Fatherland; and to the Governor whose leadership kept them from straying with a new set of medals commissioned for the defenders of Bohemia. Finally, the Reich's first conquest will be completed."

 bormann.601.t:0 "New Orders"
 bormann.601.desc:0 "The garrison in our protectorate of Böhmen-Mähren has triumphed over the pesky partisans that assaulted them during the GCW. While this saves us from another expensive police action, it also presents a potentially dangerous political precedent.\n\nThe garrison has reformist tendencies and Prague isn't that far from Germania. We could just redeploy them to some far off corner of the Reich to limit their impact of course, but then the reformists in the overall Heer would be denied a triumph they achieved.\n\nOr we could grant them their propaganda victory. Of course, this would further the impression that it is the Wehrmacht, not Führer Bormann who is the one in the driver's seat."
 bormann.601.a:0 "These soldiers must be stationed far away from Germania to contain their influence."

 bormann.602.desc:0 "With the Bohemian situation finally being sorted out, Bormann has ordered an investigation into the partisans that gave the garrison so much trouble.\n\nThe results were unsettling to say the least.\n\nIt had been widely suspected that die hard Czech and Polish resistance groups had somehow struck from Sudeten and Carpathian holdouts, but every investigated group showed the same picture:\n\nAn empty shell, cleansed of actual Czechs years, maybe even decades ago - what filled them were SS members in disguise. While one or two groups might have been little surprise considering Himmler's usual machinations, EVERY SINGLE GROUP in the entire partisan front was secretly marching under the black sun.\n\nNeedless to say, this revelation has caused widespread shock, outrage and alarm among the Reich's society. After all if the SS can do this, then how many other SS underground organisations are there?"

Von Krosigk began to talk, but was quickly silenced. Bormann's tone and demeanor was more like an animal hunting its prey than human.\n\n"Do you really expect a chance to keep your position Krosigk? There is none. I know you, better than you think. I know your Speerist sympathies. I know the "compromises" you made. I know that you have been a spineless remnant of the Weimar system for far too long, that should have been out of power when you failed the Reich in the 50's."\n\n"And yet I am the reason you aren't fighting the SS in Prague." Krosigk's defiance was measured but precise.\n\n"And that is the only reason I am letting you leave this place standing on your feet. And you will leave, make no mistake. Live the rest of your days with your family. Do NOT get in my way." Bormann casually placed his hand on the holster.\n\nThe rest of the talk was much more... smooth. In the end von Krosigk handed over power quietly."

The crowd roared as theatrically placed swastika banners rolled down the wall in bright scarlet.\n\nBormann's handling of the negotiations has been praised by the party apparatus for his bloodless ending to the longstanding Bohemia problem, and the streets of Germania have been filled with cheers at another successful acquisition for the Reich."

The outbreak of civil war did the garrison no favours, and cut off from supply and reinforcement, they began to falter. Reinhard Heydrich's legacy is not dead in Bohemia, and the SS garrison stationed in Bohemia revealed their true shade of black when they overthrew the Governor, placing the entirety of the province under martial law.\n\nNow that the civil war is over, preparations have begun to eradicate the SS from the Czech Lands and complete the conquest that has been long left unfinished. That the war can be won is not in doubt - the decision to be made is what must be sacrificed. If we take the longer route we could cripple the SS before the invasion even begins, saving vital industry but risking making us look overcautious. An all out assault would bring us glory in the eyes of the German people, but prized Bohemian factories would be crippled."

However, when one is strong they should appear weak, so whilst the OKW generals may whine at not getting to implement their "masterful works of co-ordinated Schwerpunkt", the Führer can rest easy knowing that his choice is the right choice.\n\nWhile the Heer postures against the SS at the border, agents have already begun penetrating Bohemian front lines. Taking note of force concentrations, artillery emplacements, and bunkers that would make a First World War general turn tail and run, their information gently trickles back through to the less outspoken generals, those more willing to trust in the Führer's vision. These generals selflessly compile their own, more refined plans for invasion.\n\nMassed airstrikes to the big guns will leave them as piles of scaffolding, while slipping between the rigid SS ranks to take them from the sides like Hannibal will dismantle them faster than a concentration camp doctor. And bunkers are all too stationary. Their surrender is inevitable when they are a black island in a sea of grey."

The SS may know how to build a bunker but we most certainly know how to destroy one.\n\nWho are they going to complain to when they hear the scream of the dive bomber above their heads? Certainly not the Burgundians, for they maintain their status as member of the Reich as a paper shield as much as possible. Bohemia is on it's own, and we can poke and prod at them until the moment we are confident enough to step foot on their soil, for there is no nation in the world foolish enough to say the Czech Lands are not under German dominion. Keep poking until they stop paying attention. Then, wipe them out."

The buildup has begun, and the generals of the OKW have eagerly begun drawing up their plans, keen to demonstrate the lessons learned in the crucible of war to their once-comrades.\n\nReports show that the SS garrison mustered quickly to man their border over the course of several days. It must have been a humbling sight to them to see their numbers matched, and then exceeded, and then dwarfed by the slow muster of German troops in feldgrau from across the Reich. In stark contrast to the exhaustion and weariness that seemed to plague the Heer when fighting on German soil, the men have gained a zeal unheard of since the West Russian War. It is an enlightening experience to have a true enemy, an enemy that is without doubt evil - an enemy you can hate."

Himmler's thugs have been undermining our efforts for countless years, and in their cowardly style only now revealed their true faces. They may call for aid from their master, but so long as Germany separates Bohemia from Burgundy their cries will go unheard.\n\nWhilst the SS have been busy fighting their little guerilla war, we have fought total war. We will see how well hiding in the trees serves them when the forests burn in napalm fire; how lurking in basements serves them when missiles dig their graves; how the loyalty of a dog defeats the courage of men. They are not men, but blonde beasts in the form of men, and it is long time they were put down.\n\nHangmen, butchers, evil geniuses. They have outlived their usefulness. Begin the invasion."

And each shabby prison suit they wore had a black triangle stitched upon them, the concentration camp badge for asocials.\n\n"Their self-interest was power. The power to enslave us to their cult of death..."\n\nNow the Orpo agents stepped forward, each one ensuring that gallow was prepared in such a way as to make the death as slow and gruesome as possible. They were quickly ready.\n\n"Just as they laid waste to the Reich, we shall lay waste to them, let us show Himmler, that we do not fear him!"\n\nHundreds of times the holes opened, hundreds of times the bodies fell. And hundreds of times an SS-man would slowly choke to his death.\n\nAll across Bohemia the remnants of the SS shared the same fate. The event was broadcast not just throughout the Pakt, but special care was taken that all of Burgundy could be reached by the TV signals as well. But from Burgundy there was only silence, it almost seemed like they were... apathetic?"

Admiral Karl Dönitz, who commanded that the fleet be removed from Germany during the conflict in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, reportedly approves of Führer Bormann's succession and his heartfelt work to restore peace.\n\nAdmiral Dönitz's reputation precedes him, and few of the pretenders voiced objections at his absence, either fearing his ire should he turn his fleet's guns upon them or foolishly hoping to curry favour in the event of their victory. The Admiral held true however, refusing to put his ships at risk for any other than the rightful Führer.\n\nThe Führer is expected to roll out the red carpet for his friend and ally, and no doubt honours are in order. Readers with sons in the Kriegsmarine will now doubt be relieved to know that our boys are coming home."

The Kriegsmarine, long absent from the frantic battle that had defined their recent times, had returned.\n\n"-dark times, the darkest the Reich has seen in decades. In dark times, hard choices must be made - a man must realise that his own ego is of no importance in comparison with the existence of the nation. Admiral Dönitz knew there was no honour in his choice to remove the Kriegsmarine from the war, but he knew it was the choice necessary for the good of his Fatherland. That is true honour."\n\nDönitz and Bormann stood side by side, their podium sufficiently far from the audience that none could see the Führer's sideways glance or the admiral's hint of a scowl. It was a day of peace after all, and people were looking forward rather than at the cracks in the wall they stood on."

Whilst the departure of the fleet may have caused a brief economic crisis amongst the citygoing Germans, the disappearance of drunken sailors marked for the few remaining Ukrainians a rare moment of respite from robbery and rape.\n\nNot for long, however. The departure of the Kriegsmarine was not an ending but another beginning, a reconnection with the Reich. The warships returned in fewer numbers, but accompanied by countless other vessels with shipments of bureaucrats and other, useful supplies. With the connection to Germany restored, Krim now has both a navy to maintain in fighting fitness and the funds to do it."

The Führer wishes to exploit the newly-stabilized territory by seizing control of its ports for the benefit of the Reich; not only will a cessation of this competition encourage closer ties between the Germans and the Dutch, but it will also benefit the Reich. De Rochemont may complain, but there is no harm in treating Reichskommissariat Niederlande as a German province, for that will soon be its reality.\n\nHowever, Bormann has not yet decided how best to utilize these ports once they are placed into German hands. They could be used for growing business, which will benefit us economically... or they could be transformed into Kriegsmarine bases to strengthen our naval forces."

Taking advantage of the brutal Bürgerkrieg that ravaged the Reich, the Dutch tyrant Henk Feldmeijer seized power with his SS henchmen, threatening to deliver the land to Himmler. There is no negotiation or compromise to be had with these madmen. Just as Heydrich was crushed, we will destroy Feldmeijer's pathetic little army and hang him like a filthy dog.\n\nBefore we declare war, however, we must determine how best to conduct our invasion. Many generals have pointed towards 'Operation Blauer Rhein', a standard invasion strategy drawn up years ago in the event of a Dutch rebellion. The Führer has also been approached with 'Operation Grüner Rhein', a more ferocious plan dedicated to destroying the SS swiftly and mercilessly by treating all Dutchmen as potential enemies. This plan involves mass collateral damage and the destruction of dams to wipe out the enemy, which will doubtless stir fury among the native Dutch.\n\nThe former plan is safer and more merciful, but mercy is not a word to be used when discussing the SS. As for the latter plan, it will ensure such a violent destruction of the SS that Himmler himself will not dare interfere in any more of our territories but may herald uncertain long-term consequences."

Hertzog and the Boers have proven to be a useful ally and will provide us with a loyal state when this war is over, of that I am certain. Yet the Afrika Schild is facing greater resistance than it anticipated. From what I understand, Hüttig, Schenck and Müller all expected a swift and relatively costless victory over South Africa."\n\n"And then Nixon intervened?"

American propaganda is referring to South Africa as a 'domino' that will soon fall to National Socialism unless they provide military assistance, and their troops are proving to be determined and brutal in combat. The South Africans have hardly been feeble opponents, either."\n\n"They are of Anglo-Saxon blood. It should not surprise us that Germanics would resist us so effectively."

Hans Hüttig was an SS man through and through, a barely closeted admirer of Ordenstaat-Burgund who had doubtless spent the last few years saluting portraits of Heydrich in the privacy of his Afrikan villa as the Bürgerkrieg raged on. Schenck and Müller had also remained neutral, it was true, but out of sheer pragmatism. As far as Bormann was concerned, Hüttig's loyalties lay elsewhere.\n\nThe phone clicked.\n\n"Heil Bormann!" came the clipped voice of the Reichskommissar. "Did you receive my formal congratulations on your success in the Bürgerkrieg?"\n\n"I did not. There is much I did not receive from you, Reichskommissar." There was a brief pause.\n\n"I took it as a point of principle to maintain neutrality. It would be a threat to Ostafrika's stability if its leadership were to make such a dangerous gamble." Bormann ground his teeth but did not reply. "I understand this call concerns the war?"\n\n"Yes. We must... work together if we are to defeat the capitalists. The Reich shall be providing aid to each of the Reichskommissariats to ensure a German victory in the Dark Continent."\n\n"Aid would be much appreciated," Hüttig growled.

Any advancing South Africans or Americans who dare to cross into Ostafrikan territory will be torn apart in swift and fiery revenge. As well as damaging our foes and slowing their advance, it will act as the perfect psychological weapon. Not a single enemy soldier will escape the chilling fear that every step forward could be their last.\n\nWhile our military forces in Afrika have been educated regarding these extensive plans, there have been a few casualties from civilians stepping on anti-personnel mines. This collateral damage is unfortunate, but proves the effectiveness of our strategy."

"Many of your generals have already reached out to mine to discuss strategy."\n\n"I wish to discuss one such strategic proposal with you, Reichskommissar," Bormann replied. "Your investments in the Sudwestafrikan Luftwaffe ensures our ability to control the skies over South Africa. However, you seem to have invested a little too much.

They have embraced the help of the Reich and have promised to join the Einheitspakt after the South African War in a display of courage and racial bond. Yes, racial bond.

I hereby decree that the Boer people officially be recognized as Aryans, so that we may accept them into our united faction with open arms."\n\nThe leader of the Boer Republic, Albert Hertzog, has already responded to the Führer's statement, professing his respect for the German Reich and gratitude at the racial acknowledgment."

He was reaching his nineteenth hour of intense diplomatic manoeuvring, and aching fatigue was creeping over him.\n\n"Ah! Heil Bormann! It's an absolute pleasure to speak to you, my Führer." Müller's cheery voice made Bormann grind his teeth. As annoying as the man was, he had admittedly proven himself to be a valuable asset to the Reich.\n\n"Yes, yes," Bormann replied hastily. "There is no time for pleasantries, I'm afraid. There is much to discuss. The Reich must coordinate its efforts with Reichskommissariat Zentralafrika if we are to prevail in this war. Our generals will work together to organize strategy, and I will send some weapons and men to boost your army."\n\n"Excellent!" Müller exclaimed with a laugh. "I must confess, I was rooting for you throughout the Bürgerkrieg. No other Führer would bother helping us in the struggle against these unruly South Africans, I guarantee it."\n\nBormann sighed. Sycophancy had been another one of his many skills, and he certainly knew how to detect it in other people. Nonetheless, Müller was correct; only a man like Bormann had the determination to aid the Afrikan Reichskommissariats in this war. He stifled a yawn.

The incessant gruel had left his body gaunt and pale, except from the dark bruises clustered across his back and stomach. The ragged men around him looked no better. Whether they were soldiers or politicians, Göringite militarists or Speerian liberals – in the camp, they were one.\n\nThe camp commandant marched over to the huddled mass with a group of officers. In that moment, were it not for the guards, Joachim would have murdered the commandant for his gloves and coat. The uniformed commandant looked at the men with distaste and bellowed in a gravelly voice.\n\n"Listen up, you treacherous rats! On the orders of the Führer, I am officially offering you a path towards redemption." He paced up and down the line of prisoners, eying each one up as if they were slabs of meat in a butchery. His cold eyes drilled into Joachim's, who shuddered even more violently. "The South African War rages on, and the Reich is sending troops to aid the Reichskommissars in their struggle. If any man wishes to seek penance for their treason, they will be transported to Africa immediately. If you refuse, well... depending on the severity of your crimes, you will serve the Reich in a distant labor camp or you will serve the Reich in front of a shooting squad. Any man brave enough to serve the Reich in battle, however, will step forwards now!"\n\nJoachim groaned softly. The Bürgerkrieg had been arduous enough, but it had never stripped him of his dignity like imprisonment. The South African War was probably almost won, and surely the rations in the African military would be larger than the muck served up by the camp cooks? He took a deep breath, and stepped forwards."

It was not a question. The academic straightened his tie and replied as candidly as he was able, aware that his entire career could be made - or unmade - by the Führer's reaction to his findings. "Yes, my Führer. Norway has been limited in production of food since the medieval era, and it will never be able to approach continental lands in production, for example. By 'insisting' on forced agrarianism for the Norwegians, not only are they fighting an uphill battle with the arable land and the terrorists, as you've said, but they are also fighting against a lack of proper carbohydrates. The energy and nutrients in Norwegian oats and other native foodstuffs simply fail to meet the Reich's requirements for the population to properly contribute, in labor or otherwise, without continental imports." The Führer did not immediately respond, but digested the information carefully."

"Mr. Lunde, an honor to meet with you today, truly. I understand you have some things that you would wish to discuss before we truly get down to the business of collaboration, correct?\n\n"Indeed you are. I have a few topics I would wish to bring up before I would be willing to rejoin the Pakt. After all, what's good for Norway is good for Germany, in my opinion."\n\nThe diplomat laughed. "Of course, of course. Now tell me, Lunde- what is it you would wish to change? Industrialization? A defense force? Say what it is, and I'm sure we can deliver."\n\n"Well."Lunde thought for a moment. "I'm not sure how positively you'll react to what I say here, my friend." He smiled.\n\n"Oh, come on. You'll never know until you say it."The diplomat replied again. Lunde breathed in, steeling himself.\n\n"I believe that Norway should be independent of direct German rule. We've proven ourselves loyal, we've proven that we can defend ourselves, and we've proven that Norway, by and large, supports the Aryan ideal. It seems only fair that we gain something in return for our steadfast support, and autonomy- real autonomy, not the fake client states that you held over Serbia and Bulgaria- seems like a good compromise, does it not?"\n\nThe diplomat stared at Lunde like he had two heads. Finally, after an agonizing wait, he stammered a reply."

Circling around him were several men, all leading figures of the National Socialist and Pro-German factions in Norway; many were wary of Herr Schmidt, yet others were gleeful at the prospect of securing The Reich's support in their efforts.\n\nSmoke blew from the shadowy man's mouth as he leaned into the light and regarded the others. "You've done well for yourselves, and you've done well for Norway, nothing can be more true. Even still, it has not been enough. With every passing day, the weak men in government degrade all that National Socialism has done for Norway. With every month, the wolf of bolshevism creeps closer to destroying everything that is good and right, and your government gladly leaves the door open to it. You know it, the people of Norway know it, and, luckily for us all, the Reichstag knows it too. Today I bring you a proposal. My superiors and the highest echelons of power in The Reich wish to see Norway set free again; you do as well, more than anyone. Within a matter of months, this can be true not just in our hearts and minds, but in the streets and the halls of government as well."\n\nA short drag, and a finale. "Any questions?""

 bormann.1053.desc:0 "Before the sun rose in Oslo, another struggle for the soul of our nation was already underway. Pro-German fascists and national socialists have emerged in the capitol and marched on the Storting, the supreme legislature of Norway. While the city's police forces rapidly deployed a response, Norwegians loyal to Germany have already blocked off roads and bridges across the city with vehicles and makeshift barriers. Inside the houses of government, armed fascist paramilitaries are attempting to find and seize particular representatives and heads of government; by and large these attempts have been met with failure as a last-minute tip off sent several of the legislature's members into hiding, although the putschits have already begun "prosecuting" those they've managed to find so far.\n\nOutside the city proper, ad hoc militias are being formed as the news spreads to the rest of the country and citizens discover the fragility of their liberty. Brawls and light skirmishes have already begun devolving into open gunfights in and around the city-under-siege even as military formations form up outside the city and prepare to deploy. Still, whispers of traitors and hidden pro-german elements have stalled confidence in the ability of the guard to put an end to this threat, to say nothing of its ability to actually engage with the coup's potent German support. Regardless, the current equilibrium cannot be maintained; as the military and citizens already fight tooth and nail against the storming of the capitol, the pro-Germans and fascists are rounding up the last heads of state as hostages. All that remains to be seen is the soul of the nation and the will of the people."

Eventually, military and diplomatic messages were broadcast across Norway declaring a national emergency and warning the remainder of the Norwegian government and military about an attempted coup. Finally, word was received from our intelligence services that the putschists have failed to resist the police and military crossing into the city, and resulted in the loyalists being arrested or shot to a man.\n\nWhile our professional intelligence services assure us that no physical trace was left to connect us officially to the attempt, it is more than likely that coup members will confess and implicate us at the highest echelons.\n\nAnother swathe of Germany's lands have against all reason fallen away from the guiding light of the Fatherland; it is time to ensure it never happens again. The Führer is already meeting with the General Staff and Kriegsmarine to employ all possible options to guarantee a nation hostile to The Reich does not lie at it's very doorstep."

Even now, the putschists have begun detaining the previous members of government, and evidently also those citizens who did not make their loyalties clear during the coup itself. Our contacts in the new regime assure us that in the coming days the entire nation will be under their control and order and stability will reign once more in Norway.\n\nThis is a momentous occasion; not only will we be able to maintain our military presence in the Arctic and North Seas with the benefit of Norwegian bases, economic utilization of the region will also be able to continue as planned. Further still, we have demonstrated to both ourselves and the world the strength of National Socialism and denied our enemies a safe haven on our doorstep.

All of this masqueraded equipment was bound to be offloaded and distributed at a quiet Norwegian port before being transported to hidden pro-German elements across the nation. Unfortunately however as a result of fate, ill luck, heightened Norwegian security, or the simple conspicuousness of so much unmarked cargo in one place, the transportation authorities in Norway discovered and intercepted our shipment and locked down regional trade and delivery upon its discovery. Though the firearms were unmarked and the equipment unremarkable, it is all but guaranteed that the Norwegian government now knows of the ongoing mobilization of pro-German loyalists within their borders, as well as our likely involvement.\n\nThis will not stop us.\n\nOur intelligence services are already burning any documents the Norwegians could find and our shipping manifestos are being altered to hide any potential discovery of further action.

It does not require an intelligent man to determine that the Noregian government knows that something is going on and are increasing counter-intelligence capabilities to try and flush it out. Given the rate at which we are preparing the groundwork for operations within the nation it is not surprising their officials would begin to catch on eventually, but we must maintain diligence at all times. Our preparations are not complete and local loyalists are not nearly organized enough to emerge in force, and so we must instruct them to continue their tasks as normal and not draw undue attention.\n\nEveryday we approach closer to operational readiness is a day closer to discovery; the longer it takes, the more likely we will be discovered. Conversely, if we do not plan accordingly and provision effectively, all our efforts will be for nought. Patience is the key to success, and we must not let our enemies' heightened awareness deter us from seizing it."

Instead of a regularly scheduled communique and check-in, this was an emergency burst transmission delivered hastily. As soon as the message was decrypted, our fears were unfortunately confirmed.\n\nOur operative was tailed by Norwegian agents and tracked to the local pro-German loyalist meeting place. Our man managed to escape and set the building on fire in his evasion, but now direct evidence of our sympathizer's organization is suspected and being examined for further information at this very moment. A few similar messages began filtering in soon after, and many of our contacts are not responding at all. We've transmitted messages to all cells to go-to-ground and maintain operational silence until we can present them a solution. Unfortunately, there are scant few solutions to a hostile nation aware a conspiracy is ongoing right beneath their noses.\n\nWe are beginning to run out of time and our schedule must be accelerated as a result. We must increase shipment quantity and move our units into position while we still have the advantage of surprise. We are rapidly approaching the resolution to this little hunt, and we do not intend to be its prey."

The loyalist hideout for the putschists was infiltrated by the Norwegian security apparatus early this morning, just as a meeting involving several head figures in the pro-German movement was concluding. Light automatic gunfire was exchanged with the police before the building was stormed and almost every operative within has been captured or killed in the gunfight.\n\nReports are spotty at best, but it would appear that Herr Schmidt did make it out alive, if barely; unfortunately he is not our primary concern. Those members of the conspiracy who were captured do not have the express loyalty nor the advanced interrogation resistance techniques to ensure they do not reveal our secrets. Further, since the day's meeting was critical, significant quantities of vital - and directly incriminating - documents and communiques were on the site during the raid and were unable to be removed or destroyed before Herr Schmidt's exfiltration. Our intelligence analysts have determined that Norway is absolutely cognisant of our efforts and is by the minute discovering just how extensive it truly was.\n\nThis is likely the death-knell of the prospective coup; the only course of action available now is to retrieve any and all assets we can and hide or destroy those we cannot. While our agent is being smuggled out of the country, the Führer is to be informed directly and presented with available options moving forward."

 bormann.1060.desc:0 "After years of exploration and prospecting, a vast oil reserve has been discovered in the North Sea. At first thought to be a fool's errand, exploration increased after finding natural gas in Germany's western-most Reichskommissariat in the early 1960s. Since then, private investors from both Norway and Germany have been looking for precious black gold offshore, following and prospecting the Norwegian Continental Shelf.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of costly drilling, they finally did it. Located on the southern tip of the shelf, the wealth that had been found under the sea is seemingly boundless. Geologists now even believe that there is more oil; much more lining huge swaths of the Norwegian coasts, waiting to be discovered. As of now, just the reserves that have been discovered are the largest offshore deposits in the world, to the elation of both Germans and Norwegians.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how the two will proceed from here, but oil reserves could give both economies a huge boost. Norway in particular could see huge economic benefits and some much needed industry and diversification, but must also consider Germany's interests. Nonetheless, this provides a much needed resource for both nations."

 bormann.1062.desc:0 "News from Berlin does not tend to be good news. Just today, we have been presented with an opportunity to see if this axiom is proven true once more.\n\nThe ministry of foreign affairs informs us they have just received a diplomatic invitation from Germany to renegotiate and reevaluate our "relationship" with them; in light of our people's history with one another it is a bold step for the Germans to say the absolute least. However, it is more than clear that The Reich does not handle failure and loss well, and by accepting this potential olive branch we could begin working to avoid any diplomatic - or military - incidents in the immediate future.\n\nThis a purely preliminary message; the place and time, and even the attendees, have not been specified in the text itself, though the message attempts to assure us that it will be given all due consideration on both sides. Regardless, this does place the Prime Minister in a rather delicate position. For decades our people have had the Nazi boot stamped on our throats, and there are many in the nation and government who would gladly fight the German rather than speak with them; but as much as some of our more recalcitrant citizens might wish for our two nations to glower and scowl at each other from across the sea, this is not a viable long term solution.\n\nFurther still, while we have succeeded in throwing off the tyrant's yoke once, our current military forces are infantile compared to the bloated German war machine; perhaps a treaty would do what a division of tanks could not?"

Words such as sovereignty, dignity, rights, interests, and more adorn the letter from top to bottom, notably all in contrast of or in reference to us. Ignoring their attempts at diplomatic insults, the contents of the letter is in fact quite promising! They seem to have accepted our overtures at diplomatic negotiations and are interested in pursuing a formal meeting between our representatives, preferably as soon as we are able. Though much work now lays between us and a successful conference with the Norwegians, this is an excellent first step towards managing control of the region. Not only does this spare us engaging military forces in Scandinavia, it indicates that the Norwegians are aware of their precarious position and seek to avoid any overt conflict, in politics or otherwise. This gives us the obvious advantage. Even so, there could be wisdom in refraining from pushing them too hard with any demands, for if they don't maintain their display of 'sovereignty' they might be pushed to abandon the negotiations altogether and force more... unsavory methods at resolution.\n\nRegardless of the goal, all that we need to do now is put on a smile, act polite, and engage in some bloodless - if not painless - realpolitik."

A response from the Norwegian foreign minister arrived today with their answer, and to call it a cold response would be a mild assessment.\n\nThough the language they used was colorful at times in its declination of our offer, they refrained from anything that would force the Führer on the warpath should he read the text itself, though only just barely. The closing statement of the missive in fact reads that their "...inherent rights of national sovereignty and dignity were demonstrated quite clearly once, and the German people surely do not need to be reminded again", to clear any lingering doubt about the message's true meaning.\n\nIt surprised no one in Germania that the Norwegians resented us, this much was known, but what no one was truly ready to accept was the possibility that they'd spit on the hand holding the olive branch. Their nation is unstable and their ability to resist an invasion is feeble at best; it's difficult to determine if this is a calculated move or a flash of madness.\n\nUltimately, all this does is narrow down our choice of response. Norway is valuable, in resources and strategic position, but we must determine if it's value is greater or lesser than the effort it would take to retrieve it; and yet still another variable in this equation of state is the insult this refusal's very existence imposes on us. The Führer is not known to forgive - or forget - easily."

Advocating for this locale will be seen as advocating for a position of strength to the German people and - more importantly - our support in the halls of government. Bringing the Norwegians to our table in our territory will please our supporters to no end, though Norway will take notable offence at the suggestion and the signalling of the lack of neutrality.\n\nThe second option, suggested both by the Norwegians and our intelligence services, is Oslo. Going to the home of our opponents after they detached themselves from us might signal weakness to some in Germany, but it will undoubtedly foster goodwill and bring them to believe we are sincere in our purpose. Further, if negotiations sour, our presence in the capitol will embolden our loyalists in Norway and perhaps assist in future operations in the area.\n\nFinally, as an overture to the spirit of good faith, the conference can be held at Göteborg in Sweden. This is a neutral meeting place and, with the Swedes acting as moderators, will be seen by both Norway and Sweden as a commitment to improving relations in all of Scandinavia, though perhaps less intently than if we simply went to Oslo."

Germany, a superpower by right, has come in the interest of peace in Scandinavia and laying the foundation for relations to last the remainder of its 'thousand years'. Norway, a land who just months ago was under the thumb of the Nazi hegemony, successfully slipped its bonds and comes to fortify its future in the shadow of the goliath. Though the haggling of details leading up to the conference might've seemed like a battle, it is waged in the name of avoiding a war. By extending one another the olive branch it is hoped that the swords will stay in their sheaths, though if their animosities flare there is no telling what will become of the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nFor now though, the opening ceremony and first rounds of negotiations, both in front of cameras and behind closed doors, will proceed in the hopes of peace over the coming days.

The German military is relaxing along the North Sea, and the Norwegian people are collectively breathing a sigh of relief for perhaps the first time in decades. The Prime Minister of Norway has lauded the ambassadors who attended the conference and spoken publicly in support of the results, whilst simultaneously the Führer has paraded this diplomatic victory to the acclaim of Germania. Though the true opinions of the delegates and ambassadors will forever be veiled behind their smiles, it would seem they too are looking forward to furthering their craft and normalizing relations between their nations.\n\nAlready, newsprinters across Europe and the world relay the revelations; all look towards the German and Scandinavian spheres with new interest."

The lead negotiators themselves have been found in diametrically opposed positions, neither side willing to give ground in the arbitration, and what was once thought to be the hope of peace in Scandinavia has come crashing down around them. Simple disagreements have become verbal disputes, and verbal disputes have, in at least one instance, become physical altercations.\n\nThroughout the negotiations the ambassadors generally managed to maintain propriety and politeness, but the uncompromising nature of the latest round of discussion laid bare the contempt each side had for the others' position. As one particularly recalcitrant pair of junior delegates had to be pulled apart, the signal that this attempt at compromise would never bear fruit was clear for all to see, and the Norwegian delegation left the conference in practiced defiance.\n\nBoth parties now return to their seats of power, empty in hand and low on patience; a microcosm of their respective nations' attitudes towards one another. It is difficult to know what comes next for Northern Europe but if this struggle is any indication, all signs point to further conflict."

This was one of our most desired goals of the conference, and to gain it in full is a boon we will not squander.\n\nAside from the material military benefits this affords us, it also grants us great political power both within Norway and Germania. With garrisons throughout the nation we will be able to resist Norway potentially distancing itself in the future, and by securing these basing rights the admiralty won't be able to say we do not support them."

Though attempts were made at discovering how flexible the term 'permanent garrison' could be, it seems that the Scandinavians have little to no interest in stationing German armed forces on their land. This is undoubtedly a result of previous military traumas in Norway, and it is unlikely that they can be made to freely come to terms on this issue.\n\nHowever, it could still be possible to wean them towards accepting the basing of 'military sailors' in camps 'near' the ports themselves. While it's unlikely we could get away with hosting an armored company, this potential compromise would allow us to maintain some degree of direct military control should the need arise, all while maintaining the Norwegians' sense of sovereignty. We've gotten them to accept most of our demands so far, and pushing further on this will surely test our diplomatic abilities, but leaving Norway without a direct Heer presence - no matter how small - is incompatible with the region's continued stability."

Even though we have been generous in accepting the Kriegsmarine basing in our waters and dockyards, the Germans are still demanding we also allow the rest of their armed forces full garrison rights.\n\nOnce we had drawn up the language concerning the docking rights we anticipated the rest of this matter to follow smoothly, but their zealous insistence that both of our 'national securities' rest entirely on the presence of German jackboots in Norway has sought to evaporate all of our diplomatic gains thus far. We've only just thrown off the pointless and harmful shackles of the German, and inviting their tanks back into our towns is no different than inviting the Swastika back into the Storting. Not only is this untenable to our ambassadors and delegates, the common people would resent any such concession, seeing as they bore the brunt of the German's weight in the occupation.\n\nAny attempt at compromise disintegrates on both sides, and the Germans' calls for acceptance only grow louder by the hour. With no immediate solution presenting itself, we are stuck at an impasse. We can swallow our pride and assent to allow the Germans to occupy strategic locations within Norway, in the hopes that the Germans do not renege on the accords, or we can let the conference crumble around this seemingly intractable issue."

Instead of full garrison rights for the Nazi military, they request that 'military sailors' be allowed to station in 'camps' near the Kriegsmarine in the ports and harbors. Their intent is still clear, painfully so, but through this accord we should be able to secure Norwegian safety much easier. There are those in our nation who think it treason to allow even a single German to stand on Norway's soil, but many more wish for nothing but safety from the Reich, even if we must stand aside them. Though it's not ideal - things in these times rarely are - it is a binding and paradable victory should we assent to it.\n\nStill, it would mean allowing armed Wehrmacht personnel to base - en masse - near our economically vital ports; should relations sour in the future, who knows what use they could be put towards..."

They have agreed in large parts to host our marines and sailors at the dockyards and ports, and have assented to whatever means facilitate this. Though we will be legally limited from introducing other troops outside of a defined radius from the ports, this will allow us to at least maintain operational readiness and strategic integrity in the Scandinavian peninsula.\n\nIt wasn't the resounding victory we sought, but it will at least meet the objectives of the Kriegsmarine as well as allow us to continue further negotiations with Norway. Both us and the Norwegians have shown we are willing to fight for what we need, but neither of us is above meeting the other part of the way in mutual interest. Though the Norwegians have shown determination - perhaps to a fault - we expected nothing less of a once model aryan Reichskommissariat."

 bormann.1075.desc:0 "Now that immediate matters have been settled, the second series of programs have been brought forth to the convention. The German delegation has come with the proposal of a somewhat staggering series of economic and industrial pacts and treaties to 'explore, expand, and exploit' the economic potential in the region to 'mutually improve our nations'.\n\nTheir lofty words preceded several no-less lofty proposals: The introduction of a shared market program with current and future Pakt nation-states, pinning Norway's currency to the Reichsmark off the exchange in Germania, mandating the use of German-made industrial tools and quality standards, integrating continental German dockyards for all naval construction, and much more besides.\n\nThe Norwegian delegation's eyes widened into dinner plates reading the list of 'suggestions' in what can only be described as a Nazi Corporation's wet dream. It became clear to any reader with even a modicum of economic knowledge that this series of proposals would render Norway dependent on the Reich economically, guaranteeing a long-term relationship. If the hypothetical projections are to be believed, however, it would result in large and relatively immediate benefits for the average Norwegian business owner, so long as the nation does not mind tying their future to Germany's.\n\nNow that the cards are on the table, the parties involved lean in to their compatriots in hushed whispers as the negotiations begin in earnest once again."

Aside from minor and marginal details, the Norwegian delegation has accepted the proposal in full.\n\nThis is excellent news for the prospects of the Norwegian economy, but more importantly, it is a true gift to Germany. After the press signalled that the conference was arriving at an understanding on the economic proposals, the Berlin stock exchange underwent a minor upswing. Already, the heads of German industry are sending their representatives across the Baltic and North seas to meet with potential development partners and investors in the region in the hopes of securing vital industries and contracts once the political deal is finalized and enacted.\n\nThough the conference is not over yet, this indicates that a long and prosperous relationship between our peoples lies ahead; it requires only that we follow through and seek it out, together."

Qualms over such issues as 'tenuous demand', 'impossible economics', and even 'fiscal terrorism' were raised in some of the more private meetings at the convention.\n\nEven if they choose not to see the prosperity our offer inherently brings, they have not yet left the negotiating table. They are interested in the potential opening of our markets to one another, but evidently they demand far 'fairer' terms such as not binding their currency to ours or removing the strictest mandates on production and use. The economic advisors we have brought to the delegation warn that by agreeing we ensure the region's growth will decelerate, but we must consider the possibility that it would behoove us to have a substandard policy in place than none at all."

Any economic threats we levy are feeble without another open market for us to safely engage with, and the Germans know this well. In all areas of the proposals, it seems the Germans refuse to give an inch where we need a mile.\n\nWe have been handed an ultimatum, one that will not be resolved well in either case. We can assent to the original demands in full and practically monetarily sew our nations together at the hip for the foreseeable future, or refuse the demands and be left without any form of economic treaty with the neighboring superpower, and likely the collapse of the conference as well.\n\nThe delegates are leaving the closed meetings now to deliver their reports."

In another back-room meeting discussing the finer details of the hypothetical treaty, the Germans dropped their stand-offish attitudes and instead offered an amended version of the proposals that would waive several of the more draconian measures. Norwegian currency would no longer be penned to the Reichsmark for a start, and other industrial collaboration would actually favor the common Norwegian in several instances as opposed to the few strictly corporate benefits Norway may have received otherwise. Though they are loath to give any ground, the Germans appear to have realized the value a fairer treaty affords everyone.\n\nEven so, there are parts of the economic projects that do not benefit us in the short term at all, as well as the peripheral understanding that acceptance means we will be dependent on them in trade for years to come. At this point though, holding out for a better deal does not seem to be in the cards, and the rest of the conference cannot continue without a definitive solution to Norway's economic situation."

Even as leading economic attaches from the Pakt made clear that Scandinavia lacked the capital, workforce, or technical expertise to survive alone as a modern economy, it was almost believed that our translators were sabotaging us, such was the resistance to the economic integration that was proposed. However, with the newly amended proposals, such as allowing their currency to float without being pinned to the Reichsmark, it would seem that the interminably cold reception has finally thawed.\n\nAll their posturing was simply that, a rather bold attempt to take every inch from us they could be allowed before either of us reached the breaking point. Even now the members of the conference are concluding the final alterations to the now-accepted economic deal, and relief is a widely felt emotion in the conference hall. Some may call it greedy of Norwegians - and several of our delegates have said so privately - but so long as this amended deal produces value for the peoples of Norway and Germany it will help ultimately secure the conference, and that itself is worth much more than mere Reichsmarks."

All other accords have been met, any surviving compromises have been accepted, and the capstone of the meeting may now make itself known.\n\nAfter a cordial declaration of gratitude to the Norwegians for their acts of diplomacy, the day's business was proposed to the filled delegation hall. The first - and only - motion presented by the Germans was thus; a full invitation to the nation of Norway to rejoin the Einheitspakt.\n\nBy reembracing the Pakt, the two nations would be sworn to mutual defense, to commit to embracing common laws domestic and international, and - most prominently - to stand in opposition to the enemies of Nazism around the globe. This proposal was not a shock to any of the men gathered in the conference that day, but its weight was not dismissed or lost on any of them. The results of this German demand would have resounding repercussions. Norway in the pakt would project German power to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia, as well the British Isles; even the Americans in Iceland will also undoubtedly feel the ripples of this action wash upon their shores.\n\nAs the German ambassador solemnly finished his closing remarks, he relinquished the floor and rejoined his delegation to prepare for any... terse negotiations that would follow. The Norwegians mirrored this, rapidly forming a preliminary consensus as they too prepared for the coming days - and weeks - of resolving this demand."

While the revels were underway, the gritty details of their acceptance were being formalized by communications between the Norwegians and their government as well as the party bureaucracy back in Germania. While the success of the garrison and economic deals were foundational, this is truly the crowning achievement of the summit.\n\nWith this victory we can show to the Reich's citizens, the Pakt, and the wider world that Germany's power is neither temporary nor receding - rather it is eternal and growing by the year. While our Norwegian brothers have certainly not been model members of the Reich's community, this could mark a turning point. Moving forward, our peoples will be united in goal and vision; this treaty will do what tanks could not."

 bormann.1083.desc:0 "It was known going into this week's crucible of negotiations that getting the Norwegians to return to the fold would be a near-Herculean task, and the resistance of the Norwegian delegation did not disappoint. According to their protests, the fundamental reasoning behind their nation accepting to attend a meeting of equals was to secure their future, not ours. They decry that by being forced back into the Einheitspakt, they would be forfeiting theirs and all future generations of Norwegians' "freedom".\n\nThey do not understand; so long as even a single enemy of Nazism stands, none can be truly "free". Yet, maddeningly, whenever we elucidate this point to them they push back harder than before. They have nowhere to run and we've already proven our good faith in our terms so far, so even if they cannot accept that we are fighting for the common interests of our race just yet, perhaps there are methods by which we can meet in the middle. Suggestions of permitting Norway to be granted "Pakt Observer Status" have been made, a measure that will herd them into our fold but still grant them their degrees of leeway in interacting with the wider world, even if they would not be made to observe all Pakt member laws and orders. Still, they have no other harbor in which to turn. The Reich stands astride Europe, Nazism is stronger than ever, and we stand willing to shelter them; by pressing the issue further they will surely realize the futility of resistance to the coming future."

We've come so far into the conference that the safety and security that the treaty would afford us is finally within our grasp, but by presenting this ultimatum all of it could be for nought. If we refuse, nothing protects us from the Germans - who have demonstrated throughout the conference their open lust for our union with them - or otherwise would leave our nation economically abandoned.\n\nPerhaps worse still, if we accept we would be signing away large degrees of our national sovereignty, liberty, and simple dignity. For as far as we can envision into the future our nations would be intertwined, militarily, economically, and politically. In a nuclear age where a single misstep by the arrogant Nazis - or the retribution of their enemies - could spell the end of their entire alliance, it is perhaps more dangerous to join them then spurn them. All attempts at delaying the German delegation from demanding an answer are begging to break down, and if they are not presented with a response they are not likely to continue the conference at all."

They have proposed that, failing full reintegration to the pakt, we could be offered 'Observer Status' within it. This would mean that we would have to adopt certain regulations and diplomatic stances endemic to the German's alliance, but we would be allowed to retain large measures of our autonomy and freedom in Scandinavia, Europe, and the wider world to a degree. We would be openly declaring our allegiance to those we struggled against for decades, but we would be afforded mutual-defense and market access, things that we would stridently benefit from.\n\nThis being a notable concession - as well as likely the most sought demand of the Reich - any further negotiation on the subject is not likely to bear any fruit. It would seem, then, that our delegation finds itself at a crossroads; accept membership in the Nazi community and all the risk that entails, or refuse outright and risk suffering the results of a failed conference."

However, with the compromise proposed, the Norwegians saw it as their chance of avoiding a rather unseemly ultimatum on their part, and have taken to the propal with moderate acceptance.\n\nWith this contrition, the Norwegians will officially, as well as militarily and economically, be intertwined with the Reich for the foreseeable future. Though it is a concession to not have Norway re-enter our alliance as a fully-fledged member nation, its Observer Status will meet all our of our immediate strategic goals in the region, as well as lay the foundation for furthering diplomatic progress in the future; perhaps with this coming taste they will see the wisdom in joining in full, one day.\n\nRegardless, this means that all of the capstone accords and goals of the summit have met with success, in one way or another, and has proven the conference's worth many times over by finding a way to please all parties involved."

Praise was liberally lauded upon Norway's people for our exemplary dedication to our shared national values and so on and so forth; it wasn't until the latter half of the brief memo was read that the true nature of the message made itself lucid to our foreign minister. The Germans have extended an offer to our nation to unilaterally rejoin the Einheitspakt, the Reich's hemispheric alliance, as soon as in the coming days and weeks at the earliest.\n\nThis is not something to be taken lightly. While we are more similar to the Nazis of the continent than we are different, we are not certain if we should stand by them at this time. We only just achieved what many in Norway sought for decades, sovereignty, and by rejoining the Pakt we would be ceding much of our newfound lateral powers to Germania's direction. Further, while it would be puissant to join our ideological allies in this dangerous world, there do exist differences in our goals, both material and political. It takes only a cursory glance to see what the extremes of Nazism have wrought upon Europe and the wider world, and if we join them we would be binding ourselves to the very thing we are trying to reform. Regardless, a cold war rages all around us and now by casting off from the Pakt we expose our nation to all the forces that would seek our downfall; Germany, least of all, would certainly not take such a response kindly."

Already, bureaucratic and party forces are making the necessary arrangements so as to smoothly facilitate the expansion of the Pakt, and a personal letter of gratitude from the office of the Führer is being drafted for delivery to the Norwegian heads of government. With this, our control of Northern Europe solidifies, and our ability to project military and diplomatic forces over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the wider continent return to their rightful status. More than one voice dissented as to the prospects of the Norwegians rejoining us in arms; it was feared that with their newfound sovereignty their judgement would be clouded and perhaps reject our hegemony.\n\nWisely, they realized - just as all will eventually realize - that the Reich's might is not temporary, nor fading; it is eternal and growing by the day."

It was honestly believed that as a result of the Norwegians rather dire straits they would accept membership in our international community, gladly or otherwise, but perhaps it was naive to assume so. Norway's new government has made clear to all watching that they disapprove of our true brand of National Socialism and seek to develop their own 'national destiny'; this declination is the natural outcome of our guiding absence and is evidence enough of their present and future failings.\n\nFailing to return Norway to our geo-political sphere will have lasting consequences; direct control of the North Sea and our ability to project power over the Scandinavian Peninsula will be undermined. Further still, this example sets a poor precedent moving forward to the integration and loyalty of our administered territories; if we let this stand Norway will be first to spurn us, but they may not be the last."

Erich Koch, the infamous Reichskommissar of Ukraine, has ran the colony in a mostly independent manner ever since the attempt on his life, combined with the collapse of the Reich, severed most ties between Germania and Kiew. The debate over whether he should keep his job has begun to get hot, and it's up to the Fuhrer to make the final decision.\n\nKoch himself notably sided with Göring and his militarists- something that has made him the personal choice of that wing of the Reichstag. However, it also calls his loyalty to Bormann into question. In terms of administrative competence, it seems his record as Reichskommissar is mixed. Removing him would certainly cause a wave of rebukes from the militarists, but keeping him in power- though with a few more checks on what he does- could prove fruitful. After all, Ukraine is one of the few Reichskommissariats to remain loyal during the Burgerkrieg. Certainly, he's doing something right.\n\nOn the other hand, replacing Koch with Theodor Oberländer is a similarly viable option. With a history of loyalty to Bormann and competence in his affairs, Oberländer may make a stellar Reichskommissar for Ukraine. Of course, swapping him with Koch would anger the militarists, but it may be worth it for what could be a more useful ally in the east.\n\nIn the end, it's Bormann's call.

Resistance, famine, and general native discontent all headline the letter, each detailing Koch's failure to solve them and Leibbrandt's plan to fix them. However, Leibbrandt correctly assumes, he can only introduce these reforms if his position as Reichskommissar is officially instated by Bormann.\n\nThis leaves Germania in quite the situation. While Leibbrandt clearly has a plan for Ukraine, his ideas seem to point to him being closer to the reformists in the Burgerkrieg- a group not known for its loyalty to Bormann. However, if what he says is true, his plans may be necessary to preserve the Reich's presence in Ukraine.\n\nAlternatively, replacing Leibbrandt with Theodor Oberländer is a similarly viable option. With a history of loyalty to Bormann and competence in his affairs, Oberländer may make a stellar Reichskommissar for Ukraine. If Leibbrandt is telling the truth and Ukraine truly does need these changes to survive, Oberländer may not be the right fit for the job.\n\nAt the end of the day, it boils down to Bormann to make the decision."

I, Pieter Schelte Heerema, acting Reichskommisar of Ukraine, wish to ask you to renew my mandate as Reichskommisar. I ask you this because I have a grand plan for Ukraine, and I believe that my vision will benefit all the Reich.\n\nMy plan will embark on a vast industrial campaign to turn Ukraine from a backwater of Europe into its factory.

If you worry of the potential cost, fear not- I promise that my assets will be used heavily in order to protect the Reich's finances. I trust you will see the potential in this and approve of this plan.\n\nBormann read the letter with interest- after all, an industrial Ukraine certainly held potential for his plans. He looked at the letter in his other hand- a letter dismissing Heerema in exchange for his original choice, Theodor Oberländer. Oberländer was good, certainly- loyal, competent, and intelligent.

Stahlecker, while subservient to the Führer, shares much in common with him: Both men have served their duties with impeccable devotion, both men are loyally attached to the conservative wing of the NSDAP, and both men have triumphed over their respective rebels."

The Führer was all smiles today as he safely arrived in Ostland and met with Franz Walter Stahlecker, the rightfully appointed Reichskommissar and crusher of its insurrection. Salutes and handshakes were exchanged as the two old friends reminisced about the past and committed themselves to a bright future.\n\nJoining Stahlecker in front of the cameras were two representatives of his Foreign Ministry, Minister Hans Cramer and his State Secretary Reinhard Schmidt. After a few minutes of pleasantries, the four men moved behind closed doors to initiate a five-hour meeting with the rest of Stahlecker's cabinet, in which the future direction of Ostland policy was discussed."

Obtained letters (see page 44) reveal sympathy for Speerian-esque economic reform alongside criticism of Stahlecker's competency...\n\nReinhard Schmidt: State Secretary of Foreign Affairs for RK. Ostland. Proclaimed loyalty to Stahlecker at the beginning of the Ostland Civil War.

His stomach rumbled with an animalistic groan, begging Tauscher for the breakfast he'd had to skip. Why had Stahlecker called this meeting at such short notice?\n\nHe blew on his clammy hands and rubbed them together with vigour. As usual, Heidi had hidden his gloves the evening before. It had become the morning routine for Tauscher to humour his daughter's silly little game and hunt for the gloves, but unsurprisingly she was still tucked into bed, and there was no time to go rummaging. Which genius had decided to organize this meeting for 5am?\n\n"Herr Tauscher?" came a reedy voice, suddenly pulling him out of his thoughts. A stranger stood before him, dark trench coat billowing in the wind. The gentleman's nose was tinged red from the cold wind, and a polite smile was stretched widely across his face. Tauscher was just about to respond when a blinding pain exploded across the back of his head, and darkness enveloped him.\n\nFlashes of light. Shouts of anger. Screams of mercy. Tauscher felt as though he were floating across the floor. He heard a voice he recognised, screaming about a diary. Reinhard Schmidt? A gunshot rang out. There was silence. Tauscher suddenly jolted forwards and landed on the cold hard floor. White-hot agony. He staggered to his feet, the stony walls closing in on him. He turned around to the uniformed man blocking the doorway of the cell and dropped down to his knees in prayer for the first time in decades.\n\nTwo shots rang out, echoing throughout the corridors for all to hear. Orpo officers heard it as they played card games next to the cells. Deputies heard it as they whispered their final thoughts. Ministers heard it as they hastily tied their shoelace nooses, hoping against hope that the torturers would not return. Within twenty-four hours, there was no one left in the building to hear anything.\n\nThe briefing arrived on Bormann's desk. He allowed himself a rare smile of satisfaction and pulled out an Afrikan cigar. Ostland was finally secure."

As the conflict in the Reichskommissariat escalated into furious mayhem, Meyer-Landrut forged his own path, crushing his foes against all the odds.\n\nThis degenerate represents the antithesis of National Socialist doctrine. This man, a manipulative liberal who desires to improve the living conditions of the Slavic scum in Ostland, stands firmly to the left of even Albert Speer and his acolytes. Of all the potential conquerors of the Civil War, it is Meyer-Landrut who provides the greatest ideological threat.

The group took their places at the meeting table as Walther Hewel cleared his throat.\n\n"We appreciate your arrival," Hewel began. "Needless to say, it was not an easy decision to grant immunity to your government, considering our... ideological differences. Were it not for the Führer, we may never have even considered it."\n\n"Thank you, my Führer," Meyer-Landrut nodded towards Bormann, trying to hide his surprise. "I understand this situation is a difficult one."\n\n"It's time to look forward," Bormann waved the statement away dismissively. He plucked up a document and studied it intensely. "Your land reforms have proven to be most controversial. They go against the very concept of Germanization itself. As for the issue of 'native rights'... are these reports true? Do you really stand by these reforms?" Ulrich Sahm shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

He whipped his head around just in time to see the black bag over Ulrich Sahm's head shaking side-to-side as two Orpo officers grappled him. Before he could react, Meyer-Landrut's vision was painted black as something tight was thrust over him. Both arms were wrenched back as cold metal was pressed against his wrists. He was thrown forwards into something cramped and humid, his shouts answered only by a heavy slam overhead.\n\nMartin Bormann watched from the window with growing satisfaction as the liberals were handcuffed and carted off.

Under the competent guidance of Hinrich Lohse, Ostland had been loyal to Hitler and the Reich, becoming a model colony for Germanization. With the ascendancy of Jeckeln and his Schutzstaffel cohorts, however, its connections to Germania have been severed, and the National Socialist ideals that made it so strong have been torn out and replaced with the totalitarian nightmare of the Burgundian System. This madman's fanaticism towards the principles of Himmler and his Ordenstaat fiefdom is overshadowed only by his pure hatred for Martin Bormann and the Party.\n\nThe Ostland crisis has become a topic of fiery debate in the upper echelons of German politics. The Reformist wings of the NSDAP and the Wehrmacht alike have capitalized on the political chaos by drawing ominous parallels between the SS thugs to the east and the radical Militarists within Germania. Are Jeckeln's rants about purifying his newly conquered land of its so-called traitors any different from the many speeches of Hermann Göring during the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg? Is Jeckeln's treasonous rhetoric regarding the failure of the eastern Reichskommissariats so dissimilar from the tone of Ferdinand Schörner? Would anyone deny a correlation between the anti-Hitlerist tenets of the Burgundian System and the proposed form of 'true National Socialism' as espoused by the Militarists?\n\nThese arguments are guaranteed to boost the popularity of the Reformists, to the fury of their Militarist foes."

There is no question that Himmler and Jeckeln will stop at nothing to further stretch their black tentacles across Europe's fertile land, despoiling it with their revisionist filth. The Führer's highest military officers have advised him that precautions must be made for violent actions against the Fatherland.\n\nWith a violent rattling of their sabres, the radical militarists within the Party and the Wehrmacht have seized upon this new security threat with their usual fervour. They have openly stoked fears of an Ostland invasion of the Reich and are predicting that the other Reichskommissariats will soon collapse into sinister Burgundian fortresses. Jeckeln was supposedly emboldened by the weak state of the German army, and only by meeting the militarists' demands can we prevent further civil wars and SS plots throughout Europe.

Drechsler and his men milled around the table, eying up the chairs as if they were meals on a restaurant menu, before selecting their seats. The militarist did not even glance towards Bormann, instead keeping his gaze firmly on Walther Hewel. Bormann cleared his throat. "Herr Drechsler, as my Reich Ministry for Foreign Affairs has informed you and your cabinet, I am willing to increase the conscription of the Ostland army."\n\n"Your numbers are not even close to what I requested!" Drechsler had shifted his scowl from the Foreign Secretary to the Führer with the false bravado of a man who had accidentally stumbled into a pack of lions. "Why do you continue to deny me?

The Wehrmacht shall be fully mobilized in a matter of weeks, and as soon as our units reach the border, those fools will be taught a lesson in humility.

Border raids, bandit incursions, threats from Russian warlords to retake Moskow, and the list went on: despite his efforts, his grip over Moscow was tenuous at best, and with his limited support and weak industry he was going to run out of favors and supplies very, very soon. Today however, for the first time in months, he is incredibly happy to see one letter on top of the ever-growing pile: the reason is simple, and it has everything to do with the eagle printed on it.\n\nThe message is curt and direct, and yet it's everything Kaminski wanted. Martin Bormann, Führer of the German Reich, demands his "loyalty in the upcoming struggle to re-establish German control over the territories of the former Reichskommissariat Moskowien": in exchange, the "loyal members of the administration" will receive "the needed funds and supplies" to resist "until the imminent arrival of the Wehrmacht".\n\nOf course, the last part of the message details what will happen to those who refuse to recognize the "Reich's legitimate overlordship over Russia" and especially to the "disloyal members of the former administration", but Bronislav doesn't even bother reading them. He already knows the answer, all he needs is pen and paper."

One of the several dozens dispatches, however, stands among the others: Bronislav Kaminski accepts the Führer's offer and swears his allegiance to the Reich "in a spirit of cooperation between Russians and Germans, for the glory of the Reich"\n\nBormann can't stop a slight chuckle from escaping his otherwise solemn expression. He finds it highly amusing how collaborators always use such aulic and magniloquent expressions, when in truth they are shamelessly begging for help... Still, he can't deny Kaminski's usefulness: securing a loyal hub in the middle of Moskowien will be extremely useful for the coming struggle, so perhaps a polite answer is in order.

There is, however, a serious threat of bandit attacks, and many terrorist cells linked to the Russian independence groups are still reported as active and dangerous: should they strike at our vulnerable administration, we risk suffering a serious setback!\n\nTo address this issue, the Führer has decreed that Moskowien will be supervised by a provisional military administration until the reconstruction is over. Walther Wenck, a capable officer from the Wehrmacht, will be appointed as military governor, and given all he needs to protect the rebuilding efforts and crush the last remnants of the secessionists."

This would be the best choice for the region: a military government is by definition inefficient, and the population won't tolerate to remain under the boot for much longer, however...\n\nFrom a different point of view, turning the provisional military administration into a permanent structure would grant the Führer a political victory. Ensuring that the militarists are sent to man distant outposts in Moskowien would cripple the militarist faction in Germania, and dramatically reduce their influence over the affairs of the Reich.\n\nA small sacrifice in Moskowien for a boon in Germania, or the contrary? Bormann can't help thinking that both choices have their own value, but one can't hesitate for all eternity: in the end, it's much better that Moskowien..."

Coincidentally, most officers belonging to the unofficial militarist faction of the Heer had been reassigned - or even promoted - to remote garrisons and outposts in Moskowien. Even more coincidentally, their departure was scheduled "immediately". He knew Bormann's true scheme, just as many of the others: remove the militarist faction in Germania by sending all of its members on permanent assignment to Russia.\n\nHe was furious about it, of course, and many agreed with him, but what could he do about it? Nothing. Bormann had them, he had them all. The bastard had put them in a gilded cage, one they had no hope to escape from without revealing their factionalism, and in the Reich, there were no factions, at least outside of those the Führer approved of.

 bormann.3900.desc:0 "Behind his ornate mahogany desk, Martin Bormann, Führer of the German People, faced a dilemma. In front of him was a blank sheet with the Reichsadler header marking it as an official missive from the Reichskanzlei to the Italian Empire: he had tried to convince his secretary to handle the issue as usual - or, more precisely, to "write all the niceties those haughty bastards like so much" - but his aide been adamant: for such a momentous circumstance, a hand-written letter from the Führer was the best choice.\n\nFor a moment, he was tempted to simply give up, but he would have lost face with his own government, and with the entire world. Nonetheless, making the first step still felt like a humiliation for the proud Bormann: while politics and intrigue were his mother tongue, he had never been one for international diplomacy. The Reich was destined to rule over the world, why bother with petty squabbles and traitorous partners? Still, after the civil war there was little left of that Reich, which brought him back to his current predicament.\n\nSighing, he steeled his resolve. He had to do this. His mind made, he started reflecting upon what to write. The Italians were adept diplomats - even he had to admit that keeping together an alliance of nations that were at each other's throats most of the time for almost fifteen years was quite the feat - and they clearly still held it against the Germans for Atlantropa, which meant that he had to be cautious not to fail even before beginning.\n\nAs he pondered, an idea struck his mind. When the Axis was still an actual alliance, he had studied a bit of Italian, if only to make a good impression on the dignitaries that regularly visited Germania when it was still called Berlin: perhaps he could use this to endear his potential interlocutors to him? Yes! That was the solution! Or at least a start... still, better than nothing. He bathed the nib in the inkwell, and began."

Signed by Führer Martin Bormann himself, the letter states the need for "a new dawn in the Italo-German relationships" which would usher "a renewed age of prosperity" for both countries, just as it was when we were still part of the Axis. To this end, he invites us to send a diplomatic delegation to Germania for the first time in almost two decades.\n\nWhile sudden, this change in tone is far from unexpected. The German Reich has been devastated by the civil war, and can no longer afford its old domineering stance over Europe: with most of its colonies and puppet regimes lost or no longer willing to accept German authority and exploitation, the Reich needs new trade partners to sustain its recovering economy, and the Italian Empire - the largest surviving European economy - is the ideal candidate.\n\nThe Ministry's cabinet council suggests extreme caution. While a dètente with the German Reich, and the subsequent trade deals, would be a boon for our economy - and also allow us to divert much-needed reinforcements from the Alps to the rest of the Empire - we risk feeding a beast that might one day come back to bite us.

 bormann.3902.desc:0 "Sitting at the head of the long and ornate dinner table, Martin Bormann allowed himself a moment of self-gratification. Everything was going according to plan: the Italian delegation, led by the new Ambassador, Gastone Guidotti, had symbolically passed through the Brennero border post, and the Führer had personally welcomed the Minister in front of the Reichskanzlei, showing only a tinge of envy for the beautiful Lancia Flaminia. Of course, the Italian diplomats had been impeccable, bringing gifts worthy of a leader of his stature: a golden, Reichsadler-shaped centerpiece for Bormann's office from the Duce, and an ancient, miniated copy of the Nibelungenlied from Emperor Umberto II.\n\nObviously, Martin Bormann had given the Italians ample proof that he, too, could be a courteous host. The Marble Corridor of the Reichskanzlei had been turned into an impromptu banquet hall, where the two delegations were now feasting with the finest foods from all of the Pakt - the drinks were courtesy of Umberto's own wine cellar - and mingling with each other: the guest of honor at the Führer's right was the Italian Ambassador, while his own Foreign Reichsminister was sitting at his left. Drinking from a glass of fine Lambrusco, Bormann decided it was time to know his opponent better.\n\n"How do you find the roast, Ambassador?" he asked in what he hoped was good - if a bit guttural - Italian.\n\n"Wonderful as expected, Führer, just as your mastery of our tongue" his guest replied in perfect, unaccented German, bowing his head slightly in gratitude, "however, it would please me immensely if we continued our conversation in German: it has been so long since the last time I practiced it..."\n\nBormann mentally rolled his eyes. As expected from those damned diplomats, complimenting him, saving him from embarrassment and subtly accusing him of having refused an Ambassador until now, all in the same period. For some reason, this brief exchange felt to him like some sort of salute before a duel, where your opponent gives you a moment of respite before going all in."

 bormann.3903.t:0 "A Dinner with Germania"
 bormann.3903.desc:0 "Ambassador Gastone Guidotti was used to diplomatic meetings and parties, but he still had to admit to himself that he was surprised. Travelling to Germania, he'd had ample time to reflect upon the reason for his appointment: Italy and Germany had been bitter enemies for almost two decades, and his experience would be much useful in the coming talks. His task was to assuage the truthfulness of the Führer's declarations, and whether there would be any chance of a dètente with the German Reich. Of course, no one expected the two countries to form a new alliance, but cordial relationships would be a satisfying start.\n\nNow however, Guidotti had to admit that perhaps Martin Bormann actually meant what he had written on the invitation. He had received a lavish welcome at the Reichskanzlei, and the Führer's gifts - an ancient Roman bronze vase found near Wien for the Duce, and a miniated manuscript of the Aeneid for King Umberto II - had been tasteful. After the welcoming ceremony and his accreditation, they were now dining in the luxurious Marble Salon within the Reichskanzlei, the Ambassador sitting at Bormann's right.\n\nThe host had proved an interesting conversation partner, and his knowledge of Italian - though a bit childish - had been welcome. Still, twenty years of rivalry don't end with just a fancy dinner: the Germans needed to understand the errors of their past ways for any meaningful progress to be made, and only one topic would give him the answer he had been sent for.\n\n"Führer Bormann" he began in German, his tone unchanged from the light conversation they were having before, "our countries have a long history of friendship and brotherhood, but they have been separated, as if by a dam. The Atlantropa Dam"\n\nthe Ambassador didn't fail to notice how the Führer and the man sitting in front of Guidotti - the German Foreign Minister - visibly tensed, both surprised at the sudden shift in the conversation.\n\n"Like the waters of the Mare Nostrum, so did our relationship retreat, until it was nothing but a salt wasteland, just as the Adriatic sea today" his tone, despite the smile, was serious now: "do tell me, Führer, who do you consider responsible for such a heinous crime against nature and man?"

Out of the corner of his eye, Bormann could see his Foreign Minister begging him with his eyes to make the right choice, and the silence that had fallen into the room told him that everyone had heard the question. Dozens of eyes were upon him, and he knew that the answer would either save the conference, or sentence it to a quick and painful death.\n\nOf course, the Führer had his own idea - that Atlantropa was a perfectly-justified project, and that the Italians had no right to complain - but he'd never say it. The Ambassador wanted him to admit that the Reich had wronged Italy. The easy way out was to lay the blame on his former rival, Albert Speer: he had been the one to design it, and the Ambassador would have surely accepted such an answer, but it still equalled to say that the Germans had been responsible.\n\nBormann thought about the potential alternatives. The relations between Italy and their former Iberian allies were abysmally low after the end of the Triumvirate, perhaps they'd be happy hearing him insult their newest rivals? Also, there was the eternal trump card: since fascism and national socialism share many common tenets, perhaps he could accuse the Jews - the Swiss ones especially - of having tampered with the German economy? After a few seconds of reflection, Bormann answered the Ambassador's question."

Did that barbarian truly think he would believe such a blatant lie? From the face of the German Foreign Minister, who appeared to wish for the earth to open and swallow him, the man was thinking the same thing: a pity that he wasn't the one conducting the talks. He was tempted to leave that table immediately - an insult to him was an insult to the Italian Empire, and therefore unacceptable - but he wasn't one to give up immediately. He would give the buffoon another chance.\n\n"Do tell me, Führer" he argued, still as polite as ever, though it cost him every ounce of his being, "what would the Iberians have gained from sabotaging the Dam?"\n\nWatching that triumphant expression being washed away from Bormann's face was already a small triumph for Guidotti, so he pressed on.\n\n"Have you ever been to Barcelona?" he added, sipping with nonchalance from his glass, "I don't think so, otherwise you wouldn't have failed to notice how that beautiful city, gifted with a soul of its own, has been turned into a shell of its former self, just as the rest of the Eastern Iberian coast. Valencia, Maiorca, Almeria, and many others have been ruined by that dam, just like Genoa, Venice and Naples. The fact that our relationship with our former allies has soured doesn't mean that I will rejoice at such unfounded accusations"\n\nAt the end of his speech, the Ambassador looked Martin Bormann in the eye, waiting for his answer. This, he thought, is why politicians make abysmal diplomats. Then, he heard something move under the table near the Minister, and the Führer suddenly flinched as if in pain. He barely repressed a laugh: the man had guts, did he really kick the Führer on the shin? He must have been desperate...

Oh, he already had something in mind, something about a boot and Guidotti's behind, but before he could talk he felt an explosion of pain in his shin. He looked at his Minister with hate - did he really dare to kick him?! - but sadly, he had to recognize he was right: he couldn't send all of this to hell just because the Ambassador couldn't understand basic truths.\n\nThe choice was his once again. He could swallow his pride once again, listening to his minister's concern - and his equally persuasive foot - and admitting that the Germans - or better, that Speer - had been the cause of the Atlantropa disaster, or he could stand his ground with that upstart diplomat and show him who holds the world's destinies in the palm of his hand..."

It could have gone differently, if not for the utter unwillingness of the German so-called "diplomats" to even consider admitting their responsibility: diplomacy is first and foremost compromise, how can there be diplomacy when the other demands nothing but obedience?\n\nThe sadness he felt quickly became indignation. He had parlayed with diplomats from Iberia to Japan and the United States, and everywhere he had gone throughout his long career in service to Italy, he had always found respect and openness from his counterparts, no matter their official stance towards his homeland: how did the Germans think they would be able to return a world-leading nation, if they can't even convince their direct neighbor - and former closest ally - to open an embassy?\n\nAs the mountains of Trentino gave way to the verdant hills of Veneto, Gastone Guidotti felt those negative emotions slowly ebb away. He had done his duty, and he would keep doing so, no matter his task. One avenue had been closed, but many more remained open, and he would make sure that they remained that way: the Italian Empire was ascendant, and there was no place for old relics such as the Reich in this new world.

With him gone, however, we can once more bring our great nations together, for the betterment of all!"\n\nMartin Bormann ended his speech and looked expectantly at his guest. Internally, he was fuming: he had humiliated himself and the Reich in front of everyone - the murmurs from his part of the delegation were proof enough - and Guidotti be damned if he didn't appreciate his show of diplomacy!\n\n"Indeed, Führer Bormann, it is as you say" the diplomat agreed with a slight nod, smiling, "it is sad how all this destruction and suffering are the work of a single man. Still, now he can no longer harm anyone, and our two countries can finally start to let go of the past, and forge a new future together"\n\nYes! That was it! The Führer smiled both inwardly and outwardly, knowing that he had succeeded in his endeavor. This would surely improve Germany's standing in the consess of nations, and he would be able to use this success to reassure his people of his competence and dedication to peace and progress.\n\n"The banquet has been exquisite" Guidotti added, interrupting his train of thoughts, "such a wonderful welcome. Still, I believe that the time for carousing is over: let us discuss the details for the preliminary agreement, then we shall feast again to our heart's content"\n\n"Of course, Ambassador!" the Foreign Minister was quick to interject, ushering them to the Führer's office.\n\nBormann was about to remind him that it was HIS office, but allowed the man his moment of triumph. By his side, the Italian diplomat was checking a thick envelope of papers brought to him by a young aide: his expression had changed, now looking like a hunter before beginning a safari. Despite all his previous optimism, he suddenly felt a bit unsure: for some reason, the Führer suspected that by the end of the day, the Ambassador would have found at least ten ways to convince him to declare war against the Italian Empire..."

 bormann.3913.desc:0 "Grim news from Europe today, as the diplomatic talks between the two giants of the continent - the German Reich and the Italian Empire - have failed miserably. The Italian delegation was seen leaving the Reichskanzlei mere hours after entering it, and quickly returning to Rome.\n\nThe following morning Martin Bormann, Führer of the German Reich, has declared that all initial concessions and ouvertures to the Italians will be revoked "in a matter of days" returning to the previous twenty-years-long embargo.\n\nThe Italian reaction was laconic but vehement, lamenting the German "unwillingness to address the reasons for the downfall of the Axis", a comment that most relate to the Atlantropa Dam. It seems that, despite the initial goodwill, relationships between the two powers will remain hostile for the foreseeable future.\n"

Everyone knows what the first alliance between Italy and Germany did for the world, who knows what this second one will bring?\n"

Until then, we hope that you will reflect upon the damage you caused to the Mediterranean countries, and feel sincere regret for all this pain.\n\nDutifully yours, Gastone Guidotti, Diplomatic Responsible for Northern Europe."\n\nMartin Bormann read the letter for the third time, then he crumpled it, and threw it into the dustbin. His mind was a whirlwind of emotions, the most prominent ones being indignation and rage: did the Italians really refuse to even meet with him? Did they really have the gall to refuse his diplomatic overture? They perfectly knew that this refusal would result in his own humiliation in front of the world, and yet they had landed the blow. As he silently fumed, he promised to himself that the Italians would be made to pay for this.\n\nAll of them."

With the support for these measures soaring, any action taken against them would make the government's popularity plummet, and make powerful enemies out of the traitorous bureaucrats: it seems that we'll have to live with the consequences..."

 bormann.3917.desc:0 "Holding his cigarette with two fingers, Martin Bormann looked at the map of Europe in his office one more time. Since the Gibraltar Dam has become the Damocles Sword menacingly hanging over Europe, it has been a nightmare not only for politicians but for cartographers across the Reich. He focused his attention on the old nation of the Caesars and its vast colonial empire, noticing that almost nothing remained from its famous boot shape.\n\n"Ungrateful bastards. We gave them weapons, taught them battle techniques, and endowed them the knowledge of the Aryan race. We made them who they are now," Bormann scornfully blew a puff of smoke over the Italian part of the map. On the other side of the table, Walter Hewel kept scrambling through the papers of his file.\n\n"I still remember how enthusiastic they were about the project. And they had the gall to shift the blame to us when it failed!" Murmurs of approval filled the room as the Reichministers agreed with Bormann's assessments on the Italian treachery. "There must be something about the Mediterranean race that makes them treacherous leeches, my Führer," Baldur Von Schirach haughtily proclaimed.\n\nWith a smirk of satisfaction, Hewel grabbed the paper he was looking for and closed the file. "Fortunately, our ministry has developed approaches to deal with the issue. We can keep our current confrontational position to make sure that the Italians don't bite more than they can chew. However, we can also try a detente to keep cordial relations. It would be inconvenient for us if the Americans or the Japanese get a foothold in the continent,"\n\n"Whatever the case, they'll eventually come back to us crawling. But the final decision is yours, my Führer," Von Schirach exclaimed. Bormann scanned the map once more, wondering what about the best way to bend Italy to the Reich's will."

 bormann.1205.desc:0 ""...which of course leads us here, mein Führer," the nameless consultant preached to the cabinet. Bormann rubbed his eyes. The man had been talking for twenty minutes now about the effects of the oil price crash in the Reich; all information that had been drilled into his head a dozen times now. More generic sameness; the man's name didn't even stand out. Steiner? Boch? He couldn't remember.\n\n"Enough." Bormann folded his hands. "I was called here for a briefing concerning the Middle East, not domestic affairs. I know how market prices work. Tell me about Syria, Iraq, Persia."\n\n"Ah, yes, uh, apologies sir." The man managed to stay composed, and shuffled his massive binder of notes. "What's important to us is that the status quo is breaking down in the Middle East; it has been for months, years. You could say this started with the conflict in Yemen, but sentiment has been boiling in the Middle East for a decade now, perhaps even longer." The speaker looked at Bormann, who gave him a shrug. "Uh, but you knew that. What's important is that the revolutionaries, the Ba'athists, are fighting to overthrow the status quo. That is of course the Italian and Saudi hegemony in the region." Although our economy hurts, we have to look past temporary financial setbacks." Bormann's face turned a shade of red, but before he could speak the man continued. "Now is the time for action! The Ba'athists oppose the Saudis, Italians, and various other regional players. Geopolitically, they are currently isolated. They have however already seen many successes, and would be much deadlier if they had some modern equipment. Without assistance, the Ba'athists will lose; there's too much pressure aligned against them. The situation looks different with our intervention. Starting with small arms and support equipment, we could of course increase our flow of supplies, and consider boots on the ground as the situation develops. What we need to keep in mind is victory for the Ba'aths means defeat for the Saudis, and more importantly, Italy. Italy is dealt a HUGE economic blow, one that would be felt for years. Disrupting Saudi Arabia is an added bonus, since they work closely with Italy to maintain their hegemony. This is the moment we've been waiting for to shatter Italy's influence in the region." The man's speech came to an end. He took a breath."

He bit the inside of his checks. "Stop shaking, idiot!" he thought. He had to get himself together. He hated presenting, but the Generaloberst entrusted Wagner to brief these men and give them their instructions for the upcoming mission. The room was filled; the last of the NCOs sat down. "Gentleman..." he began quietly. No one in the room looked up, the NCOs were making conversation and didn't notice. Wagner cleared his throat. "Ahem. Gentlemen!" The whole room went silent. Better. "To the task at hand..."\n\n"You all have heard rumors that we may be deploying overseas soon. The rumors..." Wagner's nerves began to settle. "...are true. You men are the best the officer corps have to offer, and you have been selected for the intervention force in the Middle East. The Generaloberst has been referring to you all as the new "Afrika Korps." The name is still pending." Wagner gave the men a second to process what he said; many of the young faces looked shocked. Some looked proud.\n\n"To hopefully answer some of your questions; you men will be leading boots on the ground, directly supporting the Ba'athist revolutionary movements scattered throughout the Middle East. That means some of you will be sent to Iran, some to Syria, and so forth. Questions?" The room was quiet. "Great." All of Wagner's nervousness was gone; he now strutted in the front with confidence. "Now, it may seem odd to help zealous nobodies in the middle of a crisis at home. Maybe it is, but command sees an opportunity to hurt the Italians and boot their asses out of the Middle East. This means that we'll be fighting Saudi Arabia indirectly, so be prepared. Success means cutting Italy off from its largest cash cow, their oil. You all sitting here, you have been handpicked, literally. You are about to embark upon a Great Crusade. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of Germans everywhere march with you. You will bring destruction upon the Italian Empire and security for our people. Be proud of that, and be ready for orders. Dismissed!""

Most, however, are turned away, as many unfortunate souls are forced to push their vehicles, their fuel tanks dry and their engines lifeless, off to the side of the road. Gas station attendants rush outdoors either to plaster "No More Fuel" signs onto the sides of the road, or to replace the now-outdated pricing figures with a higher sum.\n\nThe oil crisis has arrived.\n\nAlready, the economy of the Reich is feeling the full force of imminent economic collapse. What began as a shortage of oil and a dramatic spike in prices has evolved into the absolute devolution in investor confidence in the German economy. Even the grand mega corporations such as IG Farben and Siemens brace for impact and rapidly prepare plans to downsize operations.\n\nBy the day, more and more citizens find themselves jobless as even slave labour begins to lose its value. Not only do our future plans sit in jeopardy; so too does the entire state of the German economy. There are no options on the table. Action must be taken. Current and future projects cannot continue.

Our armories, military bases, and encamped forces have all been targeted by this crippling barrage. Everything that is visible to German aerial reconnaisance appears to become a target for the Reich.\n\nThe Ba'athists are clearly the party that are meant to directly benefit from these bombings. Already, reports of their movements begin to flood in, as Ba'athist militias prepare to strike at our reeling forces.

Up until recently, these acts were committed in complete anonymity. Law enforcement officials could do nothing but react.\n\nRecently, however, it has been discovered that these acts are far less domestic than we had originally ascertained. Following a thorough investigation, it has been uncovered that these acts of sabotage were undertaken by foreign agents belonging to the Nazi HVA. The Germans, with all their resources, have even been able to recruit several dissident citizens to assist them with their acts of terror.\n\nWithout a doubt another German ploy to bring down our regime, we are utilizing as many law enforcement resources as we can divert to attempt to foil this Reich sponsored terrorism inside our borders."

All of them are veterans of some war, and although they don't speak much off duty, they carry themselves like true warriors. Many of the younger Germans that pass through our command centers are of higher rank than these men, but look upon them with much respect and awe, and unlike their other younger peers, they don't burst into anger when they aren't saluted, which has yet to be seen from these men. It is very likely from how they carry themselves (and their numerous scars) that we have veterans from the German Civil War or from Africa among us.\n\nOur new recruits hate them, to put it mildly, but the men's new training is already paying off. The men are in better physical shape, better trained, and much more competent in nearly all aspects than any of our other recruits!

 bormann.1300.desc:0 "It started with a cluster of angry students, pumping the air with their fists and screaming meaningless slogans. According to OrPo reports delivered directly to the Führer, tensions have been simmering in universities throughout the Reich, where toxic anti-government propaganda is dripped into the ears of naive and impressionable young Germans by their fellow students and subversive academics alike. As with most student protests, the marching in Hamburg began rather pathetically and looked set to dissipate within the next day.\n\nOver time, however, the ranks of these protesters began to swell as more and more student groups joined them, carrying their cardboard signs and chanting treasonous nonsense. The protests have only grown with time, and older citizens are also beginning to march down the streets in fury.\n\nThe screeching masses writhing through the streets of Hamburg pose no real threat to us. The German people, especially the hot-blooded youth, need to let off some steam every once in a while. Such protests are not entirely unheard of, and while the demonstrations in Hamburg are admittedly larger than most, this is likely due to the current political climate. They may angrily accuse the Party of suppression and purging, but their eventual boredom will lead them back to their studies and jobs.\n\nThis is but a small thorn in our side."

What started as a small demonstration in Hamburg has spread throughout the Reich like a disease, infesting many major cities and universities. The Fuhrer has instructed Werner Naumann and the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment to completely ignore these demonstrations and focus on unifying stories instead.\n\nThe Party's patience has its limits.

Cigarettes are far more to my taste." Gehlen exhaled some smoke with a slight grimace. "According to our reports, it is not one but many different groups conducting the upcoming demonstration in Germania. Mostly students, but not all. I've provided a detailed list in this document." He patted the chunky stack of papers before him with a pale hand.\n\n"This is absurd," Bormann growled. "I want the OrPo to block off all routes to the Reichstag, and to break up the protesters as soon as they begin to coalesce. I won't have the Wilhelmstraße blocked up by a petty band of miscreants."\n\n"My Führer," Gehlen said hesitantly, "there may be a course of action that benefits us more.

While trying to escape, a few hundred stragglers were tackled to the ground and arrested for their treasonous activities.

Restaurants and government buildings alike were broken into by swarms of protestors, who looted and trashed every place they entered. One shop was set on fire, though it was quickly dealt with by the fire brigade.\n\nWhatever sparked the violence and chaos did not just infect the minds of the protestors. Enraged at the destruction and lacking any coherent orders, hundreds of OrPo officers began to break the riots apart with greater intensity than ever before.

As you can tell by the name, they claim to be communist partisans, hoping to spread the teachings of Marx throughout the Reich."\n\n"They got so tired of your useless OrPo hunting for them that they claimed responsibility for the kidnapping themselves," Bormann replied, staring at Gehlen with his steely eyes.

How would future generations of Aryans look back upon Bormann's years as Germany's triumphant leader? The thought gave him immense pleasure.

Was he anything, really, that wasn't just a number added to labor statistics? He was given his own, shoddy apartment, and his status was changed to 'employee', but to him, his liberation didn't feel like anything special. That morning, he had been looking around for Aleksy, as it had been three days since he disappeared, and, while he initially assumed that Aleksy had some sort of injury and had to recover, Antonin was starting to get concerned. Though many didn't recognize the name - one did. A woman named Zuzanna.\n\n"Can I ask you what happened to Aleksy?" Antonin asked, feeling a worry that he never thought he would have felt again after the Germans shoved him into Litzmannstadt and left the ashes of his past to rot.\n\nZuzanna seemed hesitant to respond, looking away for a moment; Antonin's gaze, however, fierce and unrelenting, forced her to look at him. "He's been relocated. Got freed three days ago and was transported to Poland proper."\n\nSomething about the tone of her voice struck her as off. In it, he could feel traces of a concealed truth. He acted on instinct rather than thought when he continued talking, and he wasn't certain why. "That's not all!" He almost shouted, and Zuzanna flinched. "S-something else happened as well- did he get there? Safely?!"\n\nShe was tempted to run, but something about Antonin possessed a sort of diehard trait to know. "... he... I heard he got sick on the way there-" Antonin's breath became hitched. Zuzanna relented for a moment before continuing. "From what I heard, there was... nothing to treat him with. I'm sorry."\n\nAntonin's head hurt as hard as if he had a migraine. Nodding emptily towards Zuzanna, he looked at his shaking hands. Something about this scenario reminded him of a memory he had never wanted to dig up again. He knew a young man, once, when he himself was younger.

As the days wear on, the debate narrows to two options:\n\nThe first contends that instead of wasting lives and equipment to re-establish the clearly defunct Generalgouvernement, the Reich should negotiate and establish a Polish client state. The militarists in the Party and the Wehrmacht are bitterly opposed, asking why the Reich should bind itself into making concessions to the Polish untermenschen - and it remains unclear what the Poles will demand in response.\n\nThe competing offer is elegantly simple on its face, if costly - an ultimatum for the Polish state to surrender to a renewed Generalgouvernement, or to face forced reintegration into the Einheitspakt. There is little doubt the proposal will be refused, and even less doubt that the Poles can resist - and the militarists are counting on a swift victory to buoy the spirits of our people at home.\n\nAs the Führer mulls his options, Wehrmacht and Polish divisions assemble at the border, digging trenches to the echoes of the last war."

Polish had been declared a dead language, useful only to historians - just one of the many untruths in the late Hans Franks' reports to Germania.\n\nMuch of the work was now complete. They'd found a handful of Polish translators, identified their red lines, and even settled on the menu for the working lunches - a formal banquet would be 'too good' for the Poles.\n\nAll that remained was to send the invitations and to prepare the city where the negotiations would take place - Danzig. The city that had been the stated cause for the last war, would now play host to negotiations to prevent the next one. It was an ironic compromise - for the Poles were unwilling to travel to Germania, and the Reich's diplomats would not set foot in hostile territory.\n\nWhatever happened now, history would be made - again - in Danzig."

There is no disguising this fact, and accordingly we will not camouflage our aims behind implausible fictions. While we welcome this opportunity for discussion, if our minimum guarantees cannot be met, then we will spare ourselves even this last fiction - for Poland's honor demands it."\n\nThe German delegation digested the statement, both irritated at the Poles' presumptuousness and relieved at their bluntness.

And what becomes of the Germans who remain in the territory held by your organization?"\n\n"As I said before, these are our minimum demands.

They are to be referred to as such in any and all official documentation, diplomatic communications, and government policy of the Greater German Reich."\n\nThe German delegation pursed their lips. While the question logically followed from the question of autonomy posed earlier, the legal terminology of the various states in the Einheitspakt posed specific problems. Accepting the demand would make Poland, for all intents and purposes, more similar to the pre-civil war Kingdom of England and the French State, accorded far more respect and prestige than the colonial Reichskommissariats that had controlled much of Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd all on Germany's doorstep!

It would be a spectacular, if somewhat haphazard, attack, relying on the initiative of individual commanders to push forward.\n\nBut what if the Poles were ready to fight the last war? If the German attack got bogged down, the political fallout could be enormous. Better to plan a methodical assault, destroying each Polish position in a hail of artillery fire before sweeping them aside in combined armed assaults. It would be slow, and there would be little glory to be had from firing a million shells at a weak adversary. But it would work."

 bormann.1512.t:0 "Meeting on "Göteborg""
 bormann.1512.desc:0 "The Goteberg sat well in the water, its flag waving stiffly over Stockholm Harbor. In a way, it could be said to represent Sweden as a whole- a proud corvette, not as large or as powerful as the massive carriers that swept the oceans or the battleships that stoically watched their respective harbors, but a ship that could pull its own weight and could fight with the best.\n\nPerhaps it was fitting that a meeting of such importance- one that could determine the economic future of Sweden, perhaps even Scandinavia- was being held here. Bormann's limousine, flanked by enough bodyguards to overthrow a small nation, pulled up to the dock to see the Swedish Foreign Minister- Torsten Nilsson- waiting for him on the ship's deck. As Bormann pulled himself from the limousine and up the gangway, Nilsson gave him a curt nod and shook his hand, cameras flashing to capture the moment.\n\n"Führer Bormann," Nilsson began, "It's an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to the Goteberg." Bormann nodded curtly, his face maintaining its neutrality. Nilsson continued. "We were planning on taking a short cruise around the Swedish coast, and then beginning in earnest. Do you wish to see your room?"\n\nBormann regarded the man with mild amusement- this was the Swedish minister, hmm? Not intimidating, very formal, outwardly friendly. He looked forward to seeing what the man was really made of. For now, however, he nodded."
 bormann.1512.a:0 "Yes, that would be good."
 
 bormann.1513.t:0 "Cruise"
 bormann.1513.desc:0 "Baltic winds swept across the bow of the Goteberg as she cut through the waters off Sweden, her crew calmly walking from post to post to keep the corvette steady. On opposite ends of the boat, in two different cabins, the delegations prepared.\n\nFührer Bormann pored over his notes, pages of economic information splayed out across his desk, occasionally shifting one way or another when a wave swept under the boat. Charts, graphs, demands, memos- it was enough to make a lesser man's head spin. Even Bormann could barely keep track of it all. He would manage, of course- always had, always would.\n\nOn the other side of the boat, Nilsson prepared his demands cautiously and carefully. The German Eagle was a prickly beast- one that didn't take requests well. He would need to pick his fights well, aim for the weak spots. At the end of the day, however, Nilsson had one advantage that Bormann did not- the Germans were negotiating with the Swedes, not the other way. He got to set the table, and he got to set the issues- invaluable things in high level talks like these.\n\nBoth parties found themselves ready to go as the clock ticked down, and when it was time, both men strode from their cabins proudly, ready for the duel of words."

 bormann.1514.t:0 "A New Agreement"
 bormann.1514.desc:0 "Bormann puffed on his cigarette idly as he studied his opponent, who was too busy reading through his papers to notice. The smoke wafted out of the open window and into the ocean air, and Bormann found his thoughts drifting back to more interesting matters- affairs in Germany, Reichstag negotiations, military operations-\n\nThe tap of papers against the table snapped Bormann's attention back to Nilsson, who had prepared himself. "Führer Bormann, I trust you understand why we're speaking here today, yes?"\n\n"Of course. Tungsten imports, steel and iron imports, the like." Bormann grunted, mildly displeased at the sudden interruption. "I trust this will be a swift process?"\n\nNilsson's brow furrowed. "I'm afraid not. With the new geopolitical situation being so different than the one before 1963, our government has seen fit that re-negotiation is in order. Namely, the previous privileges granted to the Reich- we believe that it's fit to go over these."\n\nBormann scoffed. "Of course. You want to cut all our benefits, do you?"\n\n"My government sees the removal of these limits as critical in these talks. I'm sure we can find a compromise, but this will go much smoother if the Reich concedes here."\n\nBormann's expression soured. It was what he expected, but he had hoped deep down that the Swedes wouldn't be so obstinate on the issue. With a roadblock in the way right as talks began, he'd need to choose if now was the time to make his stand."
 bormann.1514.a:0 "Fine, but there better be something in it for us."
 bormann.1514.b:0 "Absolutely not! Give us old rights!"
 
 bormann.1515.t:0 "The Reichswerke Question"
 bormann.1515.desc:0 "Bormann sighed as he read through the papers. Another issue was in his hands. At least he would get to drop this one at the feet of the Swedish minister, instead of the other way around. He looked at the other man before beginning.\n\n"Minister Nilsson, I've been informed by one of our larger companies- Reichswerke, you may know it- that the benefits they enjoyed before the Burgerkrieg have been revoked. Is there any particular reason for this change?" Bormann questioned, tilting his head, noting how Nilsson tensed a little as he heard the question. Nilsson cleared his throat.\n\n"The Reichswerke has had their benefits revoked, yes. We did so at the beginning of the Civil War- it was no longer an economic aid to us. As such, our government decided to cut our losses."\n\nBormann scowled. Swedish bastards were more greedy than the Jews or the Swiss, he thought, scarpering off with the money of good German companies at the first hint of trouble. A boiling anger raged deep within him- an impulse to strike back, to demand the restoration of Germany's status- but he held it in. Blowing up in the face of the Swedes would do him no good. Still, however, perhaps insisting on their restoration would be a good touch, even if it did strain negotiations."
 bormann.1515.a:0 "No need to insist"
 bormann.1515.b:0 "We need to protect the Reichswerke!"
 
 bormann.1516.t:0 "Geilenberg Protests!"
 bormann.1516.desc:0 "Bormann opened the letter with a mixture of distaste and dread- he knew from experience the seal on the front, and he was more than certain that the contents would be exactly as vitriolic as he expected. Geilenberg was not one to take insults lightly, and a man like that was a man who took any setback as an insult.\n\nTo the honorable Führer, Martin Bormann,\n\nYour recent decision to allow the matter of our benefits to slip off the negotiating table has been cause for much concern among us industrialists. Those benefits were crucial building blocks to building our base of operations in the Scandinavian market, and your failure to reinstate them will certainly be a great setback in our attempts to restore Germany to its former wealth. Rest assured that we will not take such insults as these sitting down, and it is expected of you to negotiate a deal that is favorable to our interests. Perhaps a reminder of who backed you in the Burgerkrieg is in order.\n\nSigned, Edmund Geilenberg.\n\nOnly the megacorporations could make such a thinly veiled threat against their Führer and get away with it, Bormann simmered as he put the letter back on his desk. His hands shook with anger as he lit a new cigar- one day, those smug bastards and their fine suits would know who the real power in Germany was."
 bormann.1516.a:0 "Who will hear him?"
 
 bormann.1517.t:0 "The Slavery Question"
 bormann.1517.desc:0 ""I'm sorry, Herr Nilsson, I simply must insist." Bormann flashed his smile, cold and calculating, and Nilsson took a moment to think. Bormann's smile morphed from a fake, diplomatic one into one of enjoyment- he would make the Swede squirm, one way or another, that was certain. Nilsson's silence pervaded through the room for a near minute before he finally began his response, slow and deliberate.\n\n"I'm certain we can reinstate those economic benefits, Herr Bormann, on one condition."\n\n"I'm all ears."\n\n"No slaves. None. Not in Sweden. You agree to that, we have a deal."\n\nExternally, Bormann's face remained unmoved, but rage shook the iron bars of his mind. Those bastard Swedes! A simple agreement, and they moralize and twist it into something rotten and corrupted, all for their profits and morals. It almost made one sick, and it was certainly something that gave Bormann the impulse to leap from his chair and strangle the diplomat then and there. He scratched his neck as he thought, trying to find some way out of his own hole."
 bormann.1517.a:0 "I shall meet with Geilenberg."
 bormann.1517.b:0 "Let us discuss other matters, no?"
 
 bormann.1518.t:0 "Negotiations with Geilenberg"
 bormann.1518.desc:0 ""Are you mad?"\n\nGeilenberg's intonation cut into Bormann's ear like a chainsaw, and the Führer sighed in frustration. "It's not what I would like either, but these fucking Swedes- they're playing hardball, you understand? Moralizing Jew bastards won't accept anything less than it."\n\n"Well, aren't you the silver tongue? You can sort out an agreement, can't you?" Geilenberg's disbelief slid slowly towards anger, and Bormann winced as he noted the change. He looked out the window as he considered his next words- Sweden, for its faults, was certainly a beautiful country. A shame that their government had to be so corrupt- it would have made a fine addition to the Reich.\n\n"Look, it is what it is. I'm sure you can spare a few slaves, can't you? I can't convince-"\n\n"You certainly can." Geilenberg's sharp voice cut Bormann's speech off, and Bormann could only listen as the magnate continued. "I expect this. . .foolishness off the table. Make it happen." Bormann resisted the urge to toss his phone out the window- one way or another, a choice had to be made."
 bormann.1518.a:0 "To hell with that! You'll thank me later."
 bormann.1518.b:0 "Don't say I didn't warn you."
 
 bormann.1519.t:0 "Swedish refuses to consessions!"
 bormann.1519.desc:0 "Nilsson smiled as Bormann re-entered the room, taking his seat heavily. The diplomat's glasses seemed to spark as he nodded, light reflecting off their glossy black rims. "Herr Bormann." He began. "I trust you have made your decision regarding our compromise?"\n\nBormann slumped in his seat, forcing himself to doom his own proposal. It was stupid, he thought- the companies could certainly spare some slaves, could they not. He was no liberal, but certainly some compromise could be made. No matter. Politics demanded that this be his hand, and so he would play it- good or bad. There's no folding at the diplomatic table.\n\n"Indeed. I have spoken with Geilenberg, and we have come to the decision. No compromise. Take the slaves or leave the business. It is yours to decide."\n\nThe look of stunned confusion that flashed across Nilsson's face almost made the whole ordeal worth it. He stammered for a moment before finding traction, recovering his poise with haste. "Well, Herr Bormann, I'm afraid that we have no deal on the benefits. We simply will not accept slaves in Sweden."\n\nBormann's face did not react to the setback- indeed, it would almost be satisfying to see Geilenberg's demand blow up in his face if Bormann wasn't going to take the fall for it. He slowly nodded, his displeasure shining through his tone- "That's very unfortunate, Herr Nilsson.""
 bormann.1519.a:0 "Shall we move on?"
 
 bormann.1520.t:0 " Unrest in Reichswerke Factories!"
 bormann.1520.desc:0 "A spontaneous outbreak of violence in Saxony, leaving 30 dead. An explosion outside a staff break room in Bavaria, leaving 12 guards dead and another dozen wounded. A slave mob forming in a factory in Poland, causing widespread destruction and requiring Heer intervention to put down. Slave violence is no stranger to the Reich, but a recent spike of incidents in Reichswerke factories has caused much concern- and anger- at our recent actions in Sweden.\n\nBormann's refusal to drop the compromise of leaving slavery out of Sweden, while successful in restoring benefits, has been directly correlated to the worrying trend of increased violence. This, of course, does not endear ourselves to our corporate friends, who's anger at our refusal to concede to them has only been compounded. What should have been a great victory for our Foreign Ministry has been turned into yet another issue to fix.\n\nIn the end, however, the benefits have been restored successfully. Perhaps one day, our success will become apparent. Until then, however, we will have to put our head down and march forwards."
 bormann.1520.a:0 "They should be thanking us, the bastards."
 
 bormann.1521.t:0 "Swedish wants access to Reich market"
 bormann.1521.desc:0 "Herr Bormann, we have received your demands regarding German preferences in Swedish markets, and we have discussed it among our delegation." Nilsson began, his eyes peering out through the lenses of his glasses. Bormann raised an eyebrow and nodded for him to continue. "We find them acceptable, on one condition."\n\nBormann kept his face neutral, despite a wave of irritation rising inside him. "What condition is that?"\n\n"We would like similar preferences in German markets. Manufacturers like Volvo or Ikea." Nilsson cooly replied. Bormann scoffed.\n\n"German manufacturers have no need for foreign competition. Why should we accept?"\n\n"Well, besides the immediate ramifications of a failure to make a deal, perhaps some competition would be useful for your business, yes? Besides, I've heard that some in your government have called for economic liberalization, and it certainly wouldn't hurt your economy to open up a little, would it?" Nilsson smiled in a way that made Bormann want to crush his skull. Of course, he did have a point- opening up the markets wouldn't be a catastrophically unpopular move. He sat, deep in thought, before replying."
 bormann.1521.a:0 "Yes, perhaps it would be better."

 bormann.1522.t:0 "Industrialist are protesting!"
 bormann.1522.desc:0 "To the Glorious Führer, Martin Bormann-\n\nOnce again, disheartening news has reached us from our contacts in Stockholm. If these reports are true, we must voice our great discontent, for they seem antithetical not only to our business practices, but to the fight against decadent western capitalism that National Socialism has espoused for decades.\n\nAllowing Swedish companies into German markets will not only threaten our shares and stakes in the European market, but allow capitalist corruption to seep into the very depths of our society. Such an opening will be exploited in full by our enemies, and we will be corroded from within by western spies.\n\nIf this sudden change in course is not corrected, we will have no choice but to preserve National Socialism by any means necessary. For the sake of our Reich, see reason and say no to these capitalist pigs.\n\nEdmund Geilenberg."

 bormann.1523.desc:0 "The next morning, Bormann traditionally walks through the corridors of the Reichkanzlei, watching the officials arriving at their offices. But this day was not like the previous ones. Passing the mime of the industry departments, Fuhrer observed only the dead emptiness of the premises. There was no rustle of documents, no tense calls between ministries. Absolute silence.\n\nBormann understands that in a situation of tense negotiations with the Swedes and industrialists, such behavior means nothing more than sabotage, and understands that a long downtime of key departments will lead to inevitable discontent of both party officials and the general population.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to make the main choice - are we ready to strike a blow at the industrialists' lobbyists in the Party, or should we succumb and yield to them in negotiations with Sweden?"

This is all you, got it? This means it's your job to salvage this mess. If it's out of your control, come get me."\n\n"Führer-"\n\n"Get out of my office, I'm extra busy now because of you."

 bormann.1528.t:0 "An awkward silence"
 bormann.1528.desc:0 ""I'm not firing Hewel, and that's final." Bormann ended his announcement. There was an angry cry from down below. Evidently those scheming bastards in the Reichstag had convinced them that Hewel was the one to botch the negotiations. While this was good for avoiding the blame for the failed negotiations, it wasn't good for Hewel. Bormann knew that an unruly mob could easily be pacified. Those bastards in the Reichstag wouldn't get him this time. He'd fire a few more men, but not poor Hewel.\n\nBormann sat at his desk, calmly filing paperwork to the sounds of the Orpo firing on a crowd."

All the men I knew in it are gone and replaced with some party bureaucrat who hates me." Bormann had a realization. He had fired too many people. "They're sort of contented but... I don't think I have as much control over them as I used to. It's more of an autonomous organ separate from me. This might cause some... problems if left unchecked."\n\n"Well I'll be sure to check it then. Good day." Bormann rushed Hewel out of his office. He began contemplating how to fix the situation."

 bormann.1530.desc:0 "Every year since the 1930s, the tonnage of ore traded from Sweden to Germany has, save for the economic crash of the 1950s, seen an upwards trend. It is an undeniable fact that the delivery of Swedish ore into our hands is essential, not only for economic reasons, but for defence reasons too.\n\nWith recent trade negotiations having thus far concluded favorably, this upwards trend is due to continue for decades to come. However, with the increased consolidation and organization of the German-Swedish ore trade, a question has risen as to who will be the responsible party for the increased transportation of ore: Germany or Sweden?\n\nUpon one hand, German firms would water at the mouth to place their hands upon the government transportation contracts which would follow such an arrangement. Adversely, such contracts could prove costly to the Reich, and the corporations would surely invent a plethora of novel costs that would suddenly be associated with the transportation of ore -- costs that they only incur now that the Reich is footing their bills.\n\nUpon the other hand, it could be left to Sweden to deliver their exports of ore henceforth, with German firms receiving their goods all the same, and the Swedish being left to foot the bills and handle the blame should shipping arrangements go awry. Our firms may be irked at such an arrangement, but the cogs of our industry will continue to turn all the same."

Is Sweden worth dooming an industry?"\n\n"You don't understand how important Sweden is." Bormann spoke up. His voice was filled with rage. "I'm a very busy man. Please leave." Bertram opened his mouth again, then realized nothing he could say would change Bormann's mind. Bertram left, disappointed.\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with similar complaints. When there was a lull in the rapid series of complaints, Bormann wondered something."

 bormann.1532.t:0 "Mistrust on the ship"
 bormann.1532.desc:0 "It was the day after Bormann had decided to leave the logistics to the Germans. The Swedes stared at him oddly. A blanket of silence had descended on the ship. Bormann and the Swedes did their paperwork separately for a while. The silence was occasionally broken by meaningless banter between delegates, but nothing substantial came of it. Bormann could almost feel the unresolved tension in the air as he and the Swedes passed papers back and forth. Despite all the papers filled out and signed, no progress was made that day."

Bormann had to leave, but Hewel could hopefully secure it on his own.\n\nBormann sat in his office, awaiting the news. Suddenly, Hewel burst into the room..."

That'd show those ignorant bastards in the Reichstag how Bormann was competent. While Hewel had signed the deal, the majority of the work had been done by Bormann, hadn't it? Bormann would make sure the official reports said this, as it was true, after all. Hewel was more of an... advisory. After Hewel had left the office, Bormann got on the phone with the censors."

We have Curt Göransson, head of the Army, Nils Montan, a Swedish ambassador to us, and the Prime Minister himself, Tage Erlander. The fourth person here is their translator." Hewel said. Almost as if on cue, Bormann walked into the room. Hewel and Wenck rushed to greet him. Bormann waved them off and sat at the table. Erlander spoke up.

They seemed pleased.\n\n"Now, about what we came here for. You see, the world is currently very unstable, and we should prepare for any instability. If we take a look here..." Wenck pointed to a spot on the map as he roughly explained German intelligence about its rivals. A discussion began about what to do if the OFN invades.

The Pakt Wargames could be used as a tool to help our relations with Sweden. We could invite all their branches of service, bringing us both closer together. This may be viewed as a violation of Sweden's neutrality, however.

While they may not be willing to fully align with us, they are willing to provide us with assistance. If Sweden were to become heavily aligned with the Pakt we would surely be able to influence Finland as well, leaving all of Scandinavia with us."

 bormann.1540.t:0 "Unification of Standards"
 bormann.1540.d:0 "An interesting concept has been floating around the Pakt as of late. This concept is the unification of equipment standards across the Einheitspakt. The new equipment and uniforms would be based on ours, giving us more influence over the current members of the Pakt. The only problem is that it could make Sweden feel like less of an equal and more of a puppet state should they join the Pakt."
 bormann.1540.a:0 "Well, let's do it."
 bormann.1540.b:0 "I'm not so sure about this."
 
 bormann.1541.t:0 "Maneuvers in Scandic"
 bormann.1541.d:0 ""So, about Scandic." Wenck said, leaning forward on the decrepit table. "Do you want our help in organizing it?" A seemingly innocent offer, it would appear arbitrary to refuse. Göransson knew better, however.\n\n"Why are you implying that the Swedes and Norwegians need your guidance for everything? These are supposed to just be joint military exercises between Sweden and Norway." Göransson replied. As usual, Montan raced to pick up the pieces.\n\n"What my colleague means here is that German involvement in affairs between Sweden and Norway could be seen by... others as a breach of our policy of neutrality. I hope you understand what effect this could have on us."\n\n"I do." Wenck said. He cleared his throat."
 bormann.1541.a:0 "Our offer still stands."
 bormann.1541.b:0 "We withdraw the offer."
 
 bormann.1542.t:0 "Northern Outpost"
 bormann.1542.d:0 "Wenck waited for Göransson to finish reading his proposal.\n\n"You want to station troops in Sweden. Using us as a military base, huh?" Göransson said. Montan glared at him.\n\n"What my colleague means is that we believe you want to use Sweden as a military base for your own interests."\n\n"That simply isn't true. You see..." Hewel began explaining. He and Montan got into a discussion consisting of empty promises and needless clarification, desperately trying to ease the tensions. Wenck and Göransson glared at each other. Finally, Wenck spoke."
 bormann.1542.a:0 "Our demands still stand."
 bormann.1542.b:0 "Fine. The Germans retract their demands."
 
 bormann.1543.t:0 "Airbase Question"
 bormann.1543.d:0 ""You want what?" Göransson was taken aback.\n\n""Airbases. We need airbases. And you're in the perfect position for them." Wenck explained. "We have to be able to send the Luftwaffe into the Arctic. It'll allow us to reach northern Russia and possibly prevent OFN troops from landing if we ever go to war. You want protection, right?"\n\n"Yes, but we don't want our country turned into an airfield! Come on, Wenck. This is like us demanding Germany to pay for airbases to be used by Sweden."\n\n"Göransson, you forget," Hewel butted in. "Sweden is not as strong as the Reich. You need our protection. It's only fair we ask for payment in return."\n\n"Then how have we-"\n\n"Alright, settle down. Do the Germans still demand we build airbases in Sweden for their use? This may be viewed by others in our country as a breach of our sovereignty."
 bormann.1543.a:0 "We need those airbases!"
 bormann.1543.b:0 "Let's not force them."
 
 bormann.1544.t:0 "Naval bases Question"
 bormann.1544.d:0 "Karl Dönitz walked into the room, surprising all those present at the negotiations.\n\n"Gentlemen, I have a proposal." He slid a stack of papers onto the table. The translator read them out loud to the group in both German and Swedish.\n\n"Give the Kriegsmarine the right to dock and repair in Swedish ports? That seems a bit... superfluous, wouldn't you say?" Montan said.\n\n"Yes, what the Swede said. Why does the Kriegsmarine need Swedish ports in the Baltic when we already have dominance over the region?" Wenck agreed.\n\n"You don't see it, Wenck. We need Swedish ports so we can project our dominance further over the Baltic. Our hold will become stronger. We will be able to more effectively pressure Finland and prevent an OFN invasion." Dönitz explained. "The Swedes will benefit from this, of course."\n\n"You understand that giving up port space to German ships will endanger our neutrality further, correct? It could even be seen as a violation of our sovereignty." Göransson countered.\n\n"Well I think it's a good idea. Hewel, how about you?" Wenck asked."
 bormann.1544.a:0 "I think Dönitz has the right idea too."
 bormann.1544.b:0 "The diplomatic hassle would be more trouble than it's worth."
 
 bormann.1546.t:0 "Concessions Protections"
 bormann.1546.d:0 "It's simple, we want to protect Reichswerke's concessions. Our land, our police." Göransson declared plainly.\n\n"It's our company, though. The Heer will do the job easily." Wenck argued.\n\n"Do you really think we can't protect our own land? I assure you, our police are some of the most well trained in the world."\n\n"You don't need police, you need soldiers. Who knows what insane bastard will attack-"\n\n"Which is why our professional police force will handle it easily-"\n\n"Your police force is neutered! They can't"-\n\n"Stop! Okay, this is due to a misunderstanding." Montan butted in. The sudden shout put all eyes on him. "Wenck, you realize that if we let the Heer protect them it'll make Sweden look weak and vulnerable, right? This is why we insist on the police protecting them instead. If you really insist, we'll let the Heer protect them. So, let's move on, shall we?"
 bormann.1546.a:0 "The Heer will be the ones to protect it, that's final."
 bormann.1546.b:0 "Well, in that case I suppose the Swedes can handle themselves."
 
 bormann.1545.t:0 "The Question of Arms Trading"
 bormann.1545.d:0 "I hope you don't find this as overbearing. We have our own demand for the Reich." Montan said. The group looked at him boredly. "We request a discount on German weapons in exchange for the restoration of Swedish exports to Germany to their pre-Civil War level."\n\n"No. You'll pay the same price for our arms as everyone else." Wenck snapped.\n\n"What? You can't just-"\n\n"I just did."\n\n"Hang on, I need to speak with my colleague in private for a bit." Hewel said. He dragged Wenck outside. "Dammit Wenck, what the fuck are you thinking?"\n\n"We have the finest arms on the planet! We don't need to give them a discount!"\n\n"This isn't about how good our arms are. This is their only demand, if we reject it we look like selfish pricks! Come on, just tell them you've changed your mind and we can put this issue to bed."
 bormann.1545.a:0 "They'll buy our superior Aryan arms at the same price as everyone else!"
 bormann.1545.b:0 "Alright, fine. But I won't be happy about it."
 
 bormann.1547.t:0 "Wissenschaftliche Gruppe"
 bormann.1547.d:0 "Let's see... what's next on the agenda..." Montan said as he attempted to organize the talks. "Ah, the Cold Climate Research Group."\n\n"The what?" Hewel asked. "I wasn't informed of this." Hewel made a mental note to fire some people once he got back to Germania.\n\n"Oh. Well, apparently some German and Swedish scientists have gotten together to research combat in the cold. They're using the north of Sweden as a testing ground." Montan explained.\n\n"What are they testing exactly?"\n\n"I'm not sure of the specifics, but they want the backing of both of us."\n\n"I'm not sure about this. We don't need to test things we already know." Rapp butted in. He and Hewel had the same suspicions about what was being tested. Pressuring Sweden into this could seem like a breach of neutrality, though if Sweden accepts we could test some... untested weaponry."
 bormann.1547.a:0 "We can't pass up an opportunity like this. Let's fight and research together!"
 
 bormann.1548.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
 bormann.1548.d:0 "The negotiations had gone on for days without any progress. It had become a screaming match between Wenck and Göransson as they both argued about which country could defend against or crush the other. Hewel and Montan sat idly by as the translator was preoccupied with the fast-paced whirlwind of insults going on behind them. Montan didn't like Hewel that much either. His head hurt from the loud screaming. He could see the writing on the wall. Montan stood up. Wenck and Göransson's argument fell into a lull as they stared at Montan.\n\n"Alright, we can all see where this is going." We said firmly. "Absolutely nowhere. So," He began picking up the documents laid on the table and stuffing them in his briefcase. "I'm going to stop this right now." He closed his briefcase, and walked towards the coatrack hanging in a corner of the room. "Sweden will not be joining the Einheitspakt as an observer. We will still continue to deal with the Germans, it'll be business as usual." He absentmindedly put on his coat and hat as he spoke. "We are neutral. We do not pick sides, okay? Neutral. The Swedes depart the negotiations. Good day." Montan left the building. Göransson followed.\n\nWenck and Hewel were left sitting in a stunned silence. Finally, Hewel spoke."
 bormann.1548.a:0 "The Führer'll have our heads!"
 
 bormann.1549.t:0 "Negotiations succeed!"
 bormann.1549.d:0 "A strange thing had happened at the negotiations. Over the past few days, Wenck had noticed that he was getting along with Göransson. The negotiations had turned from a tense argument into a friendly discussion. Everyone could see where this was going, and everyone liked it. After a bit of small talk, it was finally done. Montan looked over it with glee."
 bormann.1549.a:0 "A toast to our new cooperation!"
 
 bormann.1550.t:0 "The Letter"
 bormann.1550.d:0 "Bormann stared incredulously on the manila envelope. The rich quality paper had its smooth texture broken only by the delicately curling letters reading "Der Führer." But he had seen plenty of formal letters over the past twenty-odd years. What really threw him off balance was the wax zeal on the back of the envelope. Two lions holding a crowned shield adorned with more lions and crowns.\n\n"It's the royal se-" one of the small gaggle of secretaries who had brought the letter to his office began to say, but Bormann cut him off with a hand movement.\n\n"I know what it is, I saw this back when I was the Old Führer's assistant, before the War. But why the- I mean, what reason could the Swedish royals have for writing me? Even when the Führer nominated me successor, I only got a curt congratulatory call from that limp wristed loser they call a prime minister. I haven't seen them since the Führer's funeral, and the Reich Chancellery hasn't gotten a letter directly from Stockholm Palace since the invitation to the coronation in 1950!"\n\n"Maybe you should open it, my Führer?"\n\n"Of course I am going to open it, you mouthbreathing Bavarian turd-peddler! Siegfried, have that man demoted for making idiotic remarks about his Führer! And make sure he knows he's lucky he doesn't get worse. You! With the glasses! Letter opener, now!"\n\nOne of the other four secretaries stepped forward, lightly trembling, and gave the Führer the letter knife that had been lying on his desk in front of him. With a swift movement, Bormann opened the wax seal and glared angrily at the secretary until he retreated several steps back. The Führer let his eyes scan the single page. "Seems the Swedes want to join the Pakt. Cowards, aren't even going to put up a fight like their neighbors. Maybe that makes them smart. Oh well, one of you prepare a response praising them for their wisdom and stating I will make a state visit as soon as possible. Make sure to make it clear I want Orpo officers on the ground helping with security, I don't want some Norwegian bolshie getting any ideas. Oh, and inform Gerda she can buy some furniture if she comes along. Might put her in a better mood.""
 bormann.1550.a:0 "Off to Stockholm!"
 
 bormann.1551.t:0 "Dinner with the King"
 bormann.1551.d:0 "The assaulting smell and taste of the surströmming almost made Bormann retch, but he did his absolute best keeping it in and keeping his eyes locked with the Swedish king sitting across from him. He couldn't show weakness in front of all the dignitaries and officials from both Sweden and the Reich, especially as the Swedes had insisted a photographer be present at the dinner party. The monarch gave the suffering Führer a seeming look of genuine concern, but Bormann noticed the sparkle of playful joy in his eye.\n\n"Are you quite alright, Herr Führer? Maybe our cuisine is not to your liking? I can have the cooks prepare something else for you."\n\nBormann swallowed with great effort and gave a pained smile.\n\n"That will not be necessary. And it is 'my Führer,' Your Highness."\n\n"Your Majesty. And not quite yet."\n\nThe king gave another patronizing smile as Bormann suffered through another bite. That royal asshole, he was doing this on purpose! Fucking Bernadottes, Napoleon should have had them all shot!\n\nBormann forced another smile. "I must say I am delighted that Sweden has seen reason and wishes to join with the Reich and its loyal allies in building peace and prosperity for all Europeans. I am looking forward to the signing ceremony later."\n\nIndeed, a remarkable change of policy, Führer Bormann. I must say, over the past decades I have heard hundreds if not thousands of stories of the peace and prosperity the Reich has brought our Scandinavian neighbors since the courageous liberation of their lands from their governments. German justice, swift and effective, wielded with the efficiency and skill of NSDAP."\n\nBormann felt like he had been insulted, but couldn't put a finger on it, so he simply gave another sheepish smile and forced another piece of surströmming into his mouth."
 bormann.1551.a:0 "How much longer must this go on?"
 
 bormann.1552.t:0 "Final Negotiations"
 bormann.1552.d:0 "Today marked the culmination of our ongoing efforts to facilitate Swedish entry into the Einheitspakt and the facilitation of friendship between our great country and their... somewhat less great nation. While the Americans and Japanese might complain and whine, suggesting we "strongarmed" or somehow forced the Swedes to this point, the solemnity and pomp of today's ceremony at Stockholm's Royal Palace should awe even the international press into silence.\n\nIn the dozens of gilded halls of the palace, hundreds of dignitaries from all over Europe have been clinking crystal glass with expensive Riesling and eating Swedish delicacies. At the center of it all has been the Führer, the royal family, and the Prime Minister of Sweden, the evening culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Stockholm, marking the final integration of Europe's last truly independent Germanic state into the economic and military structures of the German Reich's mighty alliance. The Pakt will rise again after the troubles of recent years,  stronger than ever before!"
 bormann.1552.a:0 "The Eagle and The Lion united again!"
 
 bormann.1600.t:0 "Look to the North"
 bormann.1600.d:0 "The light of evening twilight thickened over the busy streets of Helsinki at the moment of the arrival of Walter Hewel by plane. From the very beginning, the Reichsminister took a contemptuous dislike to the city. At the outset, he was greeted by the inhospitable and damp weather of the North, but what was more not to his taste was the appearance of the Finnish capital itself, with its congregation of the lines of small, dull houses, rarely flavored by the architectural legacy of the Swedish and Russian colonists, lacking of monumentality, intrinsic to the cities of new Europe. In Hewel's mind, the landscape of Helsinki revealed the essence of the Finnish people in the most laconic way - a tedious city worthy of its complacent, immature nation.\n\nOf course, neither Hewel nor the Reich could afford to write off the whole nation only because of their personal sentiments towards. Finland was - and still is - a stalwart fortress against the Russian menace. Being a faithful ally and adversary to Germany during her push towards the East, Finland preferred to stay aside from events of Central Europe, sticking to their politics of "neutrality" and being satisfied with her status as a Pakt Observer,, while keeping their modest approach towards the degenerate nations of Japan and America.\n\nThe Reichsminister was able to get the first impression of his Finnish counterparts only early in the morning. Being flirtatious and friendly at surface, the Finns clearly understood what they had to bargain for and demonstrated their assertiveness behind the facade of respectability. Bringing Finland back to the lodge of the Pakt was not a straightforward task, but what's the Reich if not a persuasive, fearsome hegemon, and who's Hewel if not a man who understands it the most, after the Führer himself, of course?"
 bormann.1600.a:0 "Negotiations will proceed."
 
 bormann.1601.t:0 "Attache meeting"
 bormann.1601.d:0 "The meetings between the German attaches in Helsinki and the Finnish military delegation passed with great punctuality. The initial arrangements, flight and landing to the Finnish capital, escort to the headquarters, an evening dinner - all has been arranged accurately to the minute. After the initial share of courtesies and pleasantries, opportunity to move on to pressing problems provided itself during the meal. Among the Wehrmacht representatives, the initiative of talks laid on the shoulders of Hans Krebs, a man familiar to military diplomatic missions and officer of great dedication to the mission of National Socialism.\n\n"We appreciate the hospitality of the Finnish noble leadership " - said Krebs, slowly putting his hands on the patterned table covered with a patterned coverlet, "but at the same time, we have come with a clear task. Ever since the triumph of Führer Martin Bormann in Germania, the Finnish government showed no response in regards to the German aid. As you know, we have come to correct this misunderstanding".\n\n"Herr Krebs" - said general Marlota, barely hiding his hesitancy - "the circumstances did not suggest a viable alternative for us. The conflict between Führer Bormann and power pretenders across the Reich made it impossible to rely on the aid from Germania. With the rising tensions on the Russian border, we could not afford to neglect our territorial security".\n\n"We were assigned to help you in resolving those matters" - Krebs responded. "After all, it would be a disgrace to our reputation if the Greater Germanic Reich failed to secure peace and stability in Europe by armed means. The inviolability of Finland is as much in our interests as yours and we desire to reinvigorate the military cooperation between our nations to demonstrate our intentions"."
 bormann.1601.a:0 "Let's hope we can convince them to our rightness."
 
 bormann.1602.t:0 "Rearmament"
 bormann.1602.d:0 "To Reichsminister of Foreign Affairs\n\nWalther Hewel\n\nOn the occasion of a new stage in relationship between the Greater German Reich and Finland, we present you a short account of the state of the Finnish armed forces that has been thoroughly examined by assigned specialists for the last few decades\n\nDespite the lack of faith in the Oesch government and the rise of political opposition to the current rule, the morale in the Finnish society shows no signs of decline. Although dissatisfied by reckless actions of the Oesch administration, an average Finnish soldier stays loyal and patriotic to his country, partly in fears of the possible Russian invasion of Karelia.\n\nSuch flattening words, however, can't be said about the state of Finnish military technology. Despite their vindictiveness against the threat incoming from the Slavic barbarians, the Finnish government showed little interest in developing modern equipment for its armed forces, rendering their weaponry and vehicles outdated towards the increased demands of modern warfare.\n\nAs the result of close examinations, we advise you to negotiate with the Finnish representatives on either of two possible options. Rearmament under the German guidance is regarded as the most desirable option by the OKW, but success of this initiative entirely depends on the willingness of the Finnish government to accept the increased presence of the German military. An alternative option includes the reduced barriers in equipment trade between the two countries, but such measures, while beneficial to the Finnish military, will come at the price of our influence in the Finnish affairs.\n\nHeil Bormann!\n\nYours obediently\n\nKauffmann\n\nMilitary advisor to the Minister of Defense of Finland."
 bormann.1602.a:0 "Offer them the rearmament program on our terms"
 bormann.1602.b:0 "Giving them a discount in our weapons is enough."
 
 bormann.1603.t:0 "Send our generals?"
 bormann.1603.d:0 "Regardless of questions of morale and equipment, the Finnish military doctrine has traditionally centred on infantry-heavy, defensive operations. If the Finnish military is to be brought up to date with modern tactics and strategic doctrine, they will require assistance from an experienced military, and what military is more experienced than the Wehrmacht? We could offer the Finns, as an additional sweetener to any economic assistance, to borrow the generals Karl-Adolf Hollidt and Hans Krebs for six months to help train and reorganize their forces along modern lines. This would however leave us without their skills and long experience in the intervening period. What is the Führer's decision on this matter?"
 bormann.1603.a:0 "Offer them Hollidt and Krebs."
 bormann.1603.b:0 "The generals are needed in the Reich."
 
 bormann.1604.t:0 "Base in Lapland?"
 bormann.1604.d:0 "One of the conditions of our treaty with Finland to cede them Kola in the aftermath of the war with the Soviet Union was that we would be allowed to open a series of military bases in their territory. During the West Russian War this system coalesced into a single, very large base in the Lapland region, from whence we could exert influence across all of Northern Europe. However, only a few years later our precarious economic situation and post-war military budget cuts saw the base abandoned. We must now consider whether reasserting our influence in the region is worth potentially angering the Finns by forcing them to return the base, which would both cost them a valuable installation and be seen as a violation of the neutrality and independence guaranteed them by the Reich so far. We must judge the situation with care."
 bormann.1604.a:0 "Reopen the base!"
 bormann.1604.b:0 "Leave it to the Finns."
 
 bormann.1605.t:0 "Medical Retrofitting"
 bormann.1605.d:0 "A persistent and worrying problem for the Finnish Army is their great depletion of medical resources in the wake of the economic devastation of Europe by the repeated conflicts of the last decade. It would be sensible for us, with our great pharmaceutical firms like I.G. Farben once more producing more than enough for the home market, to offer to negotiate lucrative supply contracts to once more bring the Finnish supplies of penicillin, sulfates and vaccines up to par with that needed by a modern army in the event of large scale conflict. We must however beware the inescapable fact that the dominant firms of the pharmaceutical industry, especially I.G. Farben, will use this influx of money to greatly expand their influence."
 bormann.1605.a:0 "Negotiate the contracts!"
 bormann.1605.b:0 "We cannot cede more power to Big Pharma!"
 
 bormann.1606.t:0 "IG Farben Wants to join the Finnish Market"
 bormann.1606.d:0 "As expected, the IG Farben's CEO, Abs, has heard about the proposal to negotiate for supplying the Finnish market, and he has written the government requesting IG Farben take the lead in this supply chain, having preempted our plans by moving in directly and all already coordinating a medical equipment contract with the Finnish Army. We will now have to decide whether to allow our plans to carry on with Abs taking a leading role, or use his preemptive action as an excuse to force them out of Finland. This latter option would however upset both Abs and the Finns, and potentially make other companies more hesitant to sign up for our negotiation scheme."
 bormann.1606.a:0 "We cannot risk the plan over Abs."
 bormann.1606.b:0 "Abs must be stopped!"
 
 bormann.1607.t:0 "Chemical Labs in Lapland?"
 bormann.1607.d:0 "Abs has written us again, informing our government that the Finns have granted IG Farben the right to open a number of special cold weather labs near Rovaniemi to test experimental compounds. Normally this would be considered a welcome product of our ongoing financial involvement with Finland, but with IG Farben's alarming independence from the state apparatus, this letter has aroused suspicion among the Abwehr that more nefarious substances than just medical chemicals will be tested there. More fanciful ideas have even been posited suggesting Abs may test chemical weaponry there. Still, what Abs asks for in his letter is a relatively modest grant and permission to continue. Is it really worth upsetting the Finns at this critical stage over some wild conspiracy theories?"
 bormann.1607.a:0 "Let him have his labs."
 bormann.1607.b:0 "We cannot take the risk."
 
 bormann.1608.t:0 "Missile Defense Question"
 bormann.1608.d:0 "With the rising threat of the seemingly unifying Russian statelets in the east, the strategic missile command has asked to redeploy strategic short and medium range missiles to Finnish sites, in order to help cover the Reichskommissariats in the east from the potential danger. However, many in Finnish political circles greatly oppose this, seeing it as a blatant violation of their neutrality and possible political suicide. Should we try to force the Finns to accede for the sake of our common defense, or should we back off this question for now?"
 bormann.1608.a:0 "Eastern protection is non-negotiable!"
 bormann.1608.b:0 "We can always try again if Russia becomes an actual threat."

 bormann.1609.d:0 "To the German Führer from the Office of the President of the United States of America.\n\nWe issue in the strongest possible terms our diplomatic objection to the recent bullying of the Republic of Finland by the German Reich through unequal treaties enforced upon an independent state. If such unnecessary escalation of international tensions for no discernible gain but the imperial ambitions of the German state, the United States will be forced to consider escalation of economic and military countermeasures to secure itself and its allies from such naked aggression. I, and my colleagues in the Organization of Free Nations, strongly urge you to cease such inadmissible activities before you cause further international problems.\n\nWith regards, the President."

 bormann.1610.t:0 "The Question of the Eastern Border"
 bormann.1610.d:0 "Since the unification of the Reich, it has looked East for further expansion. The Drang Nach Ost reached its greatest extent with the defeat of the Soviet Union, but overambitious plans to stretch the Reich's border between Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan fell short with the West Russian War, a colossal surprise to a Reich that had thought the Russians a defeated enemy. Their violent and savage assault was halted at the outskirts of Moskau, and though their Red Coalition was defeated and Russia sundered once again they have continued to thwart our efforts to maintain control of our Lebensraum.\n\nMoskowien is a famously hellish station, an underfunded garrison expected to deal with both the Russians within and the Russians without. As the warlords to the east begin to consolidate their holdings, they once more establish themselves as a threat to be feared rather than an inconvenience to be driven off, and it is the quiet belief of the OKW that the time will soon come that we face a unified Russia once more. When this time comes we will have a vast front to defend, and will require all the strength we can muster to once and for all confirm our dominion over the Eastern Territories. There is only one other nation that faces the same Russian woes that we do, of Russian partisans and the rising Asiatic hordes, an unlikely ally but one that will be dragged into the Second Russian War whether they desire it or not. "
 bormann.1610.a:0 "Germany calls for aid - will Finland answer?"
 
 bormann.1611.t:0 "A United Border Service?"
 bormann.1611.d:0 "Our sole partner in the East, and another ancient enemy of the Russians - Finland exists as the only independent nation of Europe save ourselves to stand ever-alert against the Asiatic hordes of Russland. Before the war they were fearful of the Soviet imperialist desire to retake the former Grand Duchy, which itself was wracked by civil war against the Bolsheviks when the Empire fell. Instead they expanded to push the Soviets out of the Scandinavian Peninsula, taking the remainder of Karelia and the valuable northern port of Murmanni. They are protected from the violence of the Russian Hell by the Anti-Communist Guard of Onega, yet still must invest a great deal in ensuring their borders remain secure from raiders and bandits - the West Russian Revolutionary Front still maintains it's icy grip over Arkhangelsk, and may yet prove a threat against German and Finnish Lebensraum.\n\nAs the greatest power of Europe and it's protector from the forces of Bolshevism, the Finns would be well served by partnering with us to protect their gains from the Russians. Indeed they have approached us with the proposal for a united Fenno-German border service to stem the tide of smugglers, bandits and revolutionaries that seek to gain entry into our lands. It is obvious that we would bear the brunt of the burden of both funding and manpower as the senior of the two states - this would however go a great deal towards establishing Finland as a truly friendly state, rather than as a reluctant ally."
 bormann.1611.a:0 "We would be glad to have a partner on our patrols."
 bormann.1611.b:0 "They think they can leech from us to guard their own borders? Think again!"
 
 bormann.1612.t:0 "A New Mannerheim Line?"
 bormann.1612.d:0 "It may seem ridiculous now, but there was a time when Bolshevism was feared to take over all of Europe. Despite a White victory in their own civil war, it seemed only a matter of time before the Russian Reds turned their gaze westwards once more. To stem the tide, the Mannerheim line was constructed, a series of fortifications across the Karelian Isthmus to halt the Russians as soon as they left Leningrad. This invasion however never came, and it was the Russian portion of Karelia that changed hands when their state crumbled against the might of the Wehrmacht.\n\nSince then, the Mannerheim line has fallen into disrepair - but while the Finns concentrated their efforts on expelling Russian influence from Karelia, the warlords of the East consolidated their territories, and drew their plans against them. One day, Russia will come looking for it's lost lands, and both Germany and Finland must prepare for that day. The Finnish government is cash-strapped however, and there is little demand for a new Eastern wall when there are so many problems at home.\n\nThe Reich has the resources to fund the construction of another expanded Mannerheim line. Providing assistance and security would improve the natural friendship between our two nations, as well as strengthening our negotiating position. We could also expand the plan by further integrating our own border fortifications with those of the Finns and restoring the integrity of these fortifications all the way down to the Caspian Sea. The cost of this expanded plan would be exorbitant - but can you put a price on security?"
 bormann.1612.a:0 "The Finns think they can build a wall and make us pay for it?"

 bormann.1612.c:0 "Throw up an iron curtain from Finland to the Caucasus!"
 
 bormann.1613.t:0 "Send Garrisons from Moskowien?"
 bormann.1613.d:0 "Not only is Finland short of funds to defend their portion of the line to our satisfaction, but they are also chronically short of men. Their army may be elite, but the forests and lakes of Finland are even less densely populated than the vast wastes of Russia, and any series of fortifications they construct across the hundreds of kilometers of border will be drastically undermanned. Our garrisons in Moskowien, while overworked in keeping Russian national sentiment quelled, are numerous and experienced in defending against raids from beyond the border.\n\nA small vacation might do our troops good - during the day they can ensure the Finnish portion of the line is held just as firmly as our own, and by night they can relax in the saunas with the beautiful women of Finland. They may not share Germanic blood, but as Führer Hitler declared, the Finns are honorary Aryans. The Reich may not hold so much to that idea these days, but it will continue to be circulated as long as the Finns themselves prove useful."

 bormann.1614.d:0 "Our drive to secure the borders of Moskowien has pushed our garrisons away from the cities and ever-further east towards the border, as well as diverting a great number of troops northward to supplement the Finnish garrisons. Our Russian subjects, used to the constant presence of our troops to keep them in line for all these years have begun to question their future now that the German grip has loosened and the warlords of the east have begun to stabilise and make threats towards our rightfully won Lebensraum. This sickness of the mind has yet to spread too far, and there are still treatments available before they become too churlish.\n\nThe natural method would be to transfer additional troops and police officers into Moskowien to make up the loss, that the Slavs will only spend a short time wondering where their overlords have gone. A less expensive and manpower-intensive alternative would be to begin a campaign of disinformation throughout Moskowien, to quell any dissenting tendencies with propaganda before they get the chance to spread in earnest."

 bormann.1615.t:0 "A Waste Of Money"
 bormann.1615.d:0 "The Reichstag, like the ancient Roman Senate, has long been unimportant as anything other than a debate hall and an old men's club. Formality dictates that every law and budget be first passed to them before it's inevitable confirmation, and while usually they pass by without issue today they have evidently become bored and raised a fuss.\n\nThe issue of the reconstructed Mannerheim line might have been approved the first time round, but in review several holes have been picked into its fabric. Whilst construction proceeded as planned with minimal delays or additional expenditures, it was once construction was completed that issues arose. The Finns' chronic shortage of manpower extends to their new fortifications, which after their completion more often than not simply lie empty while the Finns conduct maneuvers or see to the most important areas.\n\nThe party bureaucracy, impertinent penny-counters that they are, take great offense at what they see as a vast waste of money better spent at home. While the Reichstag has little power to actually do anything other than shake their fists and complain at the expenditure, they are nonetheless deeply annoyed."

While we attempt to guard them against a threat to the East, another, more insidious one has already entered it's tendrils into the frozen North. News travels slow between the trappers and loggers of Northern Finland, but word has reached us that there are a strange set of newcomers in Lapland and Kola. Clad in midnight black and bearing the badge of the twin lightning bolts, this can only mean that SS-Ordenstaat Burgund has interests in Finland.\n\nThe purpose of this mission, as with all Burgundian missions, is unknown, though the explorers have been observed taking weather readings and soil samples in the region. Their presence is no doubt part of some insidious plot to harm the Reich, and the Führer will not tolerate their presence. We could make it a condition of our new treaty to expel these enemy agents from Finland immediately to prevent their mission being fulfilled, whatever it's nefarious purpose.\n\nAlternatively, we could simply... ignore them. What harm can a couple of explorers do above the Arctic Circle that could outweigh that done to our negotiations by making too many demands of the Finns. Their presence in the official report can be omitted, and the Führer will be happy nonetheless."

 bormann.1617.d:0 "Initially, the Scandinavian Defense Initiative was an interstate treaty of friendship and protection between Sweden and Norway under the patronage of the Reich. But, of course, the SDI is a good way to influence the officials and the military in Sweden, and, of course, the idea of inviting Finland into a similar organization became the most logical and beneficial for the Reich. However, while Finland is likely to benefit greatly from cooperation, many Finnish politicians will suspect us of trying to force Finland to step back from its status as a "neutral" power and become an puppet for the Pakt.\n\nHevel once again leaned on the back of his chair and pondered..."

The draft of our treaty is finished, but it must still pass the final test of being negotiated through the Finnish Parliament, which does not obey our own, more efficient system of Führerprinzip. Their Prime Minister must steer the treaty through the treacherous waters of democratic discussion inn order for these discussions to have been of any merit.Whilst Parliament is not a place for a foreigner to speak, our observer was permitted to listen to the Prime Minister's defense of the proposal from a shaded alcove. The Prime Minister gave an impassioned speech, which whilst it may not have paid sufficient time towards the virtues of the Reich, gave a strong argument for defensive cooperation between the Republic of Finland and the Greater German Reich. After a brief round of hear-hears, the floor was opened for debate."

The opposition called the bill degrading, and patronising, and once the floodgates of criticism had opened it was impossible to close them.\n\nAfter several rounds of fierce debating, a vote was taken, but by this time the outcome of the vote was already known. Once the formality of counting the votes was performed, the bill was rejected to a chorus of jeering by the opposition - our observer left the chambers and exited the country before anti-German sentiment grew to too great a heat.\n\nThis is an unfortunate end to the months of negotiation between our governments regarding our Eastern border, and when the inevitable Russian conflict does come, we will face it separately."

Their absence was noted by their fellow officers, with many a snide comment produced about how they were spending more time in the saunas together than they were defending against Russian raids, but nonetheless they have returned with the gratitude of their Finnish counterparts.\n\nKrebs and Hollidt quickly assumed control of their divisions regardless of the opinions of their previous officers, and established a harsh training regime that would rapidly bring the Finnish soldier to a German standard. Their tactics proved most effective in combat exercises, and whatever the Finns' opinion of them their techniques were quickly noted and replicated. Now that they have returned it will be seen whether Finnish tactics can add anything to our own repertoire, but regardless we can be a little more sure that when the time comes, Finland will hold."

Few spoke in favour of the agreement in strictly ideological terms, instead emphasising the necessity of the agreement to ensure the Republic's defense against the rapidly-stabilising Russian statelets to the East and the security of the region of Karelia.\n\nThe treaty is to be signed in the city of Brauchitschstadt, itself only a hop across the Finnish border. With only a hearty handshake between the Führer and the Prime Minister and a pair of signatures, friendship and cooperation will be restored between our two Aryan nations, and security and prosperity restored to the East."

 bormann.1622.d:0 "Marja could see Königsberg over the horizon. The journey from Helsinki had been perilous, and she had been at times unsure that they would make it. Simö had been more optimistic about their chances, which was a blessing in and of itself. Her husband had not been so lively since before the first war, when Zhadanov's cocktails had taken one of his arms. Quietly, for only a moment, she allowed herself to think that the revolution had been a good thing. As her breath stained the air white, she dismissed such thoughts, her cheeks red with shame as well as cold. Hundreds of men had died, and she was thinking of only her husband's temperament.\n\nWhen the Russians had come for Onega, the country had called Simö back to service, and he had reluctantly gone. With so many enemies in the East, they had a need for old veterans in the military service, and Simö was perhaps the oldest veteran that could still command a division. His battalion of green men had not yet left Helsinki before the lines had broken, and the eastern madmen had taken Karellia from them. Then, when their own people had risen up under the red flag, Simö and Marja had found shelter on this boat, this arc seemingly sent by God.\n\nThere were men below these decks that Marja had long applauded, and those whom Marja had rallied against. Soldiers, politicians and bankers... Perhaps the least likely refugees that one could think of, Marja thought with a quiet laugh. And yet, now they all huddled together and hoped that the Germans would take them in: Those scarred by war, and those that had been all too willing to wage it.\n\nFrom somewhere behind Marja, the captain radioed in for permission to dock. The whole ship seemed to fall silent as they awaited the answer."

 bormann.1623.d:0 "The assembly was utterly at a loss at what to do, but that was only in a collective sense. Individually, several men were very opinionated on what should be done about the Finnish issue. They made their voices known, often shouting over one another so that the gathered men would only hear their views.\n\nThe more militaristic aspects of the party, of course, seemed to favor a rather direct approach. Their spokesman made it rather clear. "We cannot allow a Bolshevik state so close to the Reich. An invasion must be planned immediately, and Finland cannot be allowed to operate with so free a hand in the future. To do otherwise would be both to show weakness and to allow an enemy of the master race to plot against us."\n\nThe reform-minded members of the assembly, however, were less enthusiastic, and a voice soon spoke clearly for them. "An invasion? Are you mad? We are overstretched as it is! The Finnish are within our sphere of influence. Yes, they may have fallen to Bolshevism but we are the only possible ally they have against the Russians. Their unsustainable state will collapse and then we will move in, as their saviors, and bring them back into the fold."\n\nBormann considered these things silently, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each option in his mind. What to do with the Finns? What would serve to best help the Reich stay strong?"
 bormann.1623.a:0 "The Führer stood to speak."
 
 bormann.1624.t:0 "Bormann's Speech"
 bormann.1624.d:0 ""The Finnish State, once a stalwart ally against the Red Menace in Russia, has now fallen under the influence of Judeo-Bolshevism." Bormann declared to the assembly, firmly. "As such, any policy of friendship and alliance we have previously held towards them must now be rescinded immediately, and the Finnish State will have this made clear to them in the strongest terms." The Führer declared, attempting to rally the assembly together with his bold speech. The militarists certainly looked rallied, though the rest of the assembly was not as swayed.\n\n"However..." Bormann continued. "At this time, an invasion of the Finnish State is not in the best interests of the Reich, which is what must be kept foremost in the minds of this assembly. The Einheitspakt must be strengthened and the Reich's power fully restored before such a thing can be done. As such, I will now lay out the plans of the Reich in regards to the Bolshevik disgrace calling itself Finland."\n\n"As of now," The Führer searched the crowd for Hewel and Lange, to ensure that they were present and that they were paying attention. It seemed they were. "The German Reich will be holding Finland in a state of total embargo. We will furthermore permit none of the nations of the Einheitspakt, nor any other nation, to trade with these communists until this regime is toppled. The Kreigsmarine will fully enforce this measure, until the Finnish are liberated."\n\nAs Bormann stepped down, those assembled began to bicker amongst themselves, though none dared raise a voice to Bormann himself. It seemed that nobody was entirely satisfied with this new policy."

 bormann.1630.d:0 "REICHMINISTRY OF ECONOMICS\n\nSTATUS OF THE FINNISH BLOCKADE\n\nFINLAND - BOLSHEVIK STATE - UNDER GERMAN BLOCKADE\n\nThe recent embargo of Finland has been highly successful, with an estimated 80-85% of attempted imports and exports being stopped. The attempts have not declined nearly as much as anticipated, however, with the daily attempts to bypass the brigade sometimes reaching as many as a dozen. We expect that this trend will not continue, though we cannot be certain.\n\nWith these estimated trends, we can extrapolate that the Finns will begin feeling the harsh impacts of this blockade sometime in the next few months. Without the food and luxuries provided to the Finns by German companies, the Finnish people will probably rebel against this government much more quickly than they did the last, especially considering the lack of action against the Russians.\n\nThere are some concerns that goods are being smuggled into Finland via Sweden, though the Swedish have assured us that they intend to respect the German blockade in full. At this moment, we see no reason to doubt the truth of this statement by our Swedish friends, as the Bolshevik state is perhaps an even greater threat to them than it is to us.\n\nThe operation is expected to be a success."

 bormann.1631.d:0 ""Paper? We're in a shortage of paper?" Bormann read aloud the report Lange had handed him. "How did this even happen?"\n\n"Well, my Führer, it comes down to our bureaucracy. We need a lot of paper to run the Reich, and we don't have enough. We're doing relatively alright at the moment, but it could turn into an incredibly nasty situation soon."\n\n"Well, let's get some more paper for the Reichskanzlei." Bormann said. Lange quickly interrupted him.\n\n"Well, you see, that also could cause another problem. The shortage of paper applies to the Reich as a whole, not just the Reichskanzlei. If we divert paper to the bureaucracy, we would get a shortage of paper in the military and for civilians. The other problem is, if we don't divert our current supply of paper to one of them, all of them will suffer. It's up to you where we send our paper, my Führer."\n\nBormann leaned forward, deep in thought. Lange anxiously awaited his answer. The quiet seemed to last for hours. Finally, Bormann spoke again."

I never specified the schools." Bormann said. He didn't seem angry, merely mildly irritated. Lange froze again.\n\n"I- Well, I assumed you were talking about the schools when you said to divert paper to the civilians." Bormann didn't respond. "Of course, you could, theoretically, divert paper to the entertainment industry to keep the people occupied. That could lead to them being less unhappy during the shortage, but it would come at the cost of their education. Teachers may not be able to teach their students properly. Honestly, my Führer, I think that diverting it to education would be for the best." Bormann once again sat and thought for a while. Finally, he spoke."

"There's a problem with that. We need to direct papers either to the Wehrmacht or the Orpo. The Orpo has a massive database filled with criminals that needs a large amount of paper to maintain, and the Wehrmacht needs large amounts of paper to document military goings-on. Whichever you choose, the other is going to suffer significantly."\n\n"Better than both of them suffering." Bormann replied. "How about...""

But how did it hold up? Looking at it now Bormann found it to be a bit... idealistic. It was filled with decrees of war against the Jew and the Slav and all degeneracy everywhere but... hadn't Germany already won? Endsieg had already been achieved, hadn't it?\n\nThere were two answers to this question. One was "No, it hasn't yet." This answer was a militarist one. It didn't align with Bormann's views at all. It was better than the other one, which was "Yes, it has." This was even worse because it implied that Naziism was a failed idea. The two answers to this book's question on Endsieg promote ideas that Bormann finds... unfavorable. If it was any other book it could just be banned, but this is the official book of the Reich itself; Hitler's masterpiece. But Hitler isn't alive anymore.

We're supposed to discuss forests."\n\n"You see, we at the Reich are experiencing a shortage of paper and we need more wood from any source possible. Upon your entry into the Pakt, as an observer, of course, we expect you to import wood to us."\n\n"This is outrageous! Those forests are our national pride and joy! We need that wood!" Krebs butt in.\n\n"We also need that wood. We're running out of paper, and we desperately need more." Lange said. "Our bureaucracy may suffer from this immensely if we don't resolve it quickly." he turned to Hewel. "Come on, Hewel. Aren't you tired of having to write so small you get cramps?"\n\n"Well yes, but we can't just boss around our Finnish friends like this. We can harvest from Moskowien." Hewel replied. Lange glared at him. "However, it would take an incredibly long time for the shortage to subside if we tried to use Moskowien more. Our infrastructure there isn't as developed." Lange smirked at Krebs. Krebs sighed.\n\n"Are you sure you want to force us to do this? We won't take kindly to it.""

While many would consider economic negotiations with the Finns a terrible fate, including Hewel himself, he followed this dull banshee's call and ended up at the negotiation table once more. Lange was beside him, no doubt to pressure the overwhelmed Finnish foreign minister even more.\n\nThe Finns, despite their relative weakness, were a much needed ally of the Reich. Even if they only joined as an observer, their nickel, iron, and wood would be invaluable to the entire Pakt as a whole. It could significantly improve the Reich's economy due to a large amount of resources available for a cheap price.\n\nThat is, if Hewel can get the Finns in the Pakt in the first place."

It's still using Soviet Union era infrastructure. This is a problem in a lot of railways leading to Finnish cities." Krebs cleared his throat for a moment, gauging the reactions of Hewel and Lange. Hewel looked rather bored, while Lange leaned forward in his seat, listening intently. "Luckily we have a... benefactor who may be willing to help us." Krebs winked. "If Finland is to join the Pakt as an observer, we'd like the Germans to rebuild our railways. I'm sorry, but you'll all have to pay for it."\n\n"I'm no economist, but I don't think that that's worth it for us. Lange, what do you think?" The two looked expectantly at Lange. Lange took a breath."
 bormann.1638.a:0 "I think that's a good arrangement."

Our developing economy-"\n\n"I know about your developing economy." Lange said, tired of Krebs's requests. "How badly are these upgrades needed?"\n\n"Very badly. You know how most of our major cities are currently connected by an old Soviet railroad? It's like that but with our equipment." Lange glanced at Hewel, who was eyeing the Finn closely.\n\n"Are you sure? I find it to be unlikely that a nation such as yours would have such terrible equipment AND terrible railroads."\n\n"Well, you see, Our lack of updated equipment has prevented us from fixing the railroads." Krebs explained. Hewel didn't buy it.\n\n"Then why didn't you ask for that in the first place?" he remarked. Krebs narrowed his eyes.\n\n"Look, I'm not the one who made this stupid schedule, but we really need updated equipment. You're not an economist, and neither am I. Let's ask the economist here what he thinks." Krebs turned to Lange expectantly. Lange sighed."

Lange explained. "They want special nickel concessions, and they want a lot of them. And when I say a lot, I mean a lot."\n\n"Do we have to?" Krebs asked. "First you ask for our wood, now our nickel too? I'm not sure our economy can handle this. You're our main trading partner, after all."\n\n"Well it's better than not getting any trade with us at all." Lange retorted.\n\n"Everyone will be angry at you. This may doom the negotiations, you know."\n\n"I don't think it will, but diplomacy isn't my expertise. Hewel, what do you think?""

 bormann.1641.d:0 "Herr Lange," Hewel said as he stepped into Lange's hotel room. "We should've listened to Krebs." Hewel handed Lange a newspaper.\n\n"Bridge collapses..." Lange read. "The Finnish government has said the reason was outdated repair equipment... oh no." he put it down. "This doesn't make us look good. Should we help them out?"\n\n"Well, I've been thinking about that." Hewel said. "There are two options: One, we help out, it helps us save face with the Finns, but we still look sort of bad. Two, we don't help out, we admit no responsibility whatsoever, and no one but us and the Finns know about this. The second one will hurt the relationship between us and the Finns, but at least we won't look like we collapsed a bridge out of malice."\n\n"That's a... bit of a conundrum." Lange wiped his forehead. "I think we should..."
 bormann.1641.a:0 "...help out."
 bormann.1641.b:0 "...stay quiet."
  
 bormann.1642.t:0 "Invite Nokia?"
 bormann.1642.d:0 "We have another request of our own." Krebs declared. "We'd like Nokia to be invited into your markets fully."\n\n"Are you insane? The corporations will skin us alive if we do that! Especially Siemens, they're our primary supplier of electronics! This is insane, and we, as the Reich, are forced to-" Lange exclaimed.\n\n"Nokia won't even take up that much of the market. Come on, do you really think a small Finnish electronics corporation can take on your corporations? It's not like we'll destroy your economy. In fact, both our economies may prosper."\n\n"You obviously know nothing about economics. Come on, Hewel, you agree with me, right?" Lange asked. Hewel scratched his chin."
 bormann.1642.a:0 "Why not."
 bormann.1642.b:0 "I don't think we should make Siemens angry."
 
 bormann.1643.t:0 "Visa-Free Finns?"
 bormann.1643.d:0 "We want Finns to be able to travel throughout the Pakt without a visa." Krebs blurted out suddenly. "The other members of the Pakt can do that, we want to do it also."\n\n"Then join the Pakt fully. That is only reserved for full Pakt members." Hewel said boredly. Krebs shook his head.\n\n"We can't align with you all fully. The Japanese and Americans shutting off our markets would destroy us. We want to, but it just isn't possible. Visa-free travel could show the unity between us even more."\n\n"It sets a bad precedent; it makes it look like any member of the Pakt can just opt out of concessions and still get the full benefits of the Pakt. Can you imagine what that would do to us diplomatically? Hell, even the economic ramifications are bad, right Lange?" Hewel turned to Lange expectantly, awaiting Lange's affirmation. Lange spoke."
 bormann.1643.a:0 "No. We can make an exception this time."

 bormann.1644.d:0 "Lange smiled as he greeted the rest of the representatives from the Pakt, as well as the Finnish representative present at the summit. They would all discuss what to do about the Pakt's economy. After the hours of talks they would all agree to whatever Lange said with virtually no compromise or disagreements.\n\nIt was the perfect opportunity to get the Finns in. Surrounded by Pakt members eagerly discussing economic benefits as well as pressuring the meek diplomat sent into a field he didn't specialize in- it would be like taking candy from a baby.\n\nThe awaited moment finally came. The summit focused on the treaty with Finland for a few hours, and then passed it to Krebs. Krebs took a breath and said..."

 bormann.1645.t:0 "An Inadequate Response"
 bormann.1645.d:0 ""No." The room looked at him in shock.\n\n"I'm sorry, what was that?" Lange asked, praying it wasn't true.\n\n"I said no. I'm not signing this. This is incredibly unfair, it just cripples Finland to benefit you." Krebs glared at Lange. "I'm sorry to disappoint, but I never had the intention to sign this in the first place."\n\n"Why did you come, then?"\n\n"I thought it would be polite." Krebs began disorganizedly stuffing the papers he had brought with him into his briefcase. It took a few minutes to get them all in.\n\n"I mean, you invited me here, so I might as well have the decency to show up." Krebs put on his coat and hat.\n\n"Goodbye."\n\nLange and the rest of the summit sat in silence for a while.\n\n"Ahem, well then." Lange said, and changed the topic of the conversation. Despite all he did, Lange's failure hung over the meeting like a ghost."

 bormann.1646.t:0 "An Adequate Response"
 bormann.1646.d:0 ""Alright." Krebs said. Lange exhaled. He knew that Krebs would sign the treaty, but it didn't stop him from worrying.\n\n"Great!" was all he could say as Krebs slowly signed the document. Lange couldn't help but notice the regret in Kreb's eyes. Krebs obviously wondered if this was the right choice for Finland, if he was doing the right thing or if he should have refused instead. Lange smiled. Krebs thought he had a choice in the first place.\n\nThe rest of the summit went off without a hitch. Lange dominated the discussion, and it resolved well. Lange looked out the window of his car as he was leaving the summit to see a dejected Krebs stepping out of the building."

 bormann.1647.d:0 "In a lavish ceremony and reception tonight at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, the Kingdom of Sweden affirmed its desire and plans to integrate itself into the German alliance and economic-industrial sphere in Europe. Furious accusations of German coercion and imperialism have been leveled from Washington and Tokyo, but with even the notoriously nazi-skeptical royal family backing the move, internal reactions have so far been muted.\n\nAt the ceremony itself, however, all were smiles and positive about the future of Sweden alongside that of the Reich. The Führer Martin Bormann was however a notable exception; seeming pale and sick, a number of conspiracy theories have already spawned about a possible poisoning attempt by Swedish intelligence or the royals themselves."

 bormann.1648.d:0 "The Brauchitschstadt II Treaty of Arctic Security, or as it is more commonly called, the New German-Finnish treaty, has recently been negotiated between the Reich and its former ally in their war on the Russians. While the exact provisions of the treaty are not public, it is widely speculated it was an attempt by the new Führer to reassert some of the authority the Reich lost in Northern Europe in the chaotic fifties.\n\nWhat is certain is that if OFN analysts are correct in assuming the treaty does involve the stationing of German troops and firms in Finland, the northern state may soon grow dependent on protection by the German Reich against any resurgent Russian states, to the dismay of the Finns and the delight of Germania, which fears Russian resurgence."

 bor_econ.2.d:0 "Martin Bormann thumbed through the documents with interest, his enthusiasm growing with every flick of a page. According to isolated reports, oil had been discovered in the North Sea. The Führer shook his head in disbelief and leaned back in his chair. Surely not? Was such untapped potential for economic growth hiding away between the British Isles and northern Europe?\n\nOptimism without reason was pointless. Bormann grabbed a pen and began to scribble. Clandestine investigations would be launched immediately to determine the validity of these reports. Naturally, he expected to have his doubts confirmed. Yet if investigations yielded discovery..."

He knew it was foolish to be excited. After all, the report was likely to have found no traces of oil, rendering the entire investigation a waste of time and resources. And yet...\n\nHe couldn't believe the words he was reading. His eyes raced across the pages with increasing speed until he slammed his fist on the desk and laughed out loud. Oil had been found in the northern shelf! Untapped oil, precious, not yet claimed by any nation. Bormann smiled at his own genius. The Reich will declare the North Sea oil rights to be exclusively German."

 bor_econ.22.t:0 "The Final Stand"
 bor_econ.22.d:0 "The arguments have increased in intensity and pitch, and the Germans have finally put their feet down. The German delegates have accused their foreign counterparts of acting with a reckless sense of impunity unbefitting their minor statuses, going so far as to threaten military intervention in the event of their ultimatum being rejected for a second time. Despite virulent outcries from their guests, the Germans went on to compare the power and size of the Heer and the Kriegsmarine to the less impressive land armies and navies of the present countries."
 bor_econ.22.a:0 "A powerful threat."

 bor_econ.23.t:0 "Unintended Consequences"
 bor_econ.23.d:0 "Our bullying has proven effective, and the foreign delegates have begrudgingly and legally accepted our claims to the North Sea oil. However, due to the tensions of our arguments, the nations are much less willing to provide us with proper assistance in extracting the resource, and will very clearly be dragging their heels in allowing us to fully exploit it.

 bor_econ.100.d:0 "Martin Bormann, as ever, was early. He strummed the table impatiently as Reichsminister Lange and his men filed into the room and took their places at the table.\n\n"Hurry up, gentlemen. We have so much to discuss." He spread his arms open. "Reichsminister Lange and I have drawn up a new initiative destined to secure the Reich as the absolute hegemon of Europe. We have called it 'The Modern Wunderwaffe'." The economists looked at each other with impressed faces and nodded eagerly. "We shall initiate various governmental infrastructure and pipeline projects throughout Germania. This city shall become the nexus of the continent in the next decade! Reichsminister Lange, if you please."\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Kurt Lange nodded. He was a colourless, bald man in a dull grey suit. A model functionary of the state. "As we all know, the overreliance on slavery has crippled our economy and decimated the working class. Slaves will barely be involved in the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative, mark my words. It is the German worker who shall toil and sweat over these projects, and their newly-earned wages will encourage more spending. Many German firms are financially collapsing and cutting jobs, but the economic boost provided by this new wave of spending should ensure a rise in employment."\n\n"All we need to do is push, and the snowball shall grow into an avalanche," Bormann finished with smug satisfaction."
 bor_econ.100.a:0 "But what is to be done with the slaves?"

 bor_econ.101.t:0 "A Corporate Solution"
 bor_econ.101.d:0 ""Listen up!" Bormann shouted at the chattering economists gathered around the table. They snapped into silent attention. "Here are the final Modern Wunderwaffe proposals formulated by Reichsminister Lange and myself. For this initiative to succeed, we must deal with the slave question. To make way for the working class, the slaves will be deported to small ethnic territories and newly established ghettos throughout eastern Europe. Whether these destinations are in their nation of origin is of no interest to the bureaucratic process. They are all, essentially, untermenschen."\n\n"I have a couple of questions, my Führer," one of the bespectacled functionaries spoke up, awkwardly raising his hand. Bormann nodded at him to continue. "How long can we expect this process to take? And how are the Big Four going to fit into this?"\n\n"It will not be instantaneous," Bormann explained. "The deportation will be at a sensible, gradual pace. The most able slaves will be deported last, of course, so that during the waiting process they can supplement the infrastructure projects with their labor."\n\n"As for the Big Four, if I may," Kurt Lange continued, shuffling his notes. "Presumably you are referring to the mega corporations? Well, we will be attempting to enlist the help of all four, but naturally one will become our primary partner. Siemens is the smallest and most loyal corporation and so will require the least down payment for cooperation. Daimler-Benz is relatively loyal as well, although Reichswerke is less so, and IG Farben's allegiance is by far the most dubious - although it must be said, they are the largest and most powerful, and therefore the most useful."\n\n"Enough, Reichsminister," Bormann interjected. "I have already made my decision.""
 bor_econ.101.a:0 "Siemens is the most loyal corporation."
 bor_econ.101.b:0 "Daimler-Benz will cooperate with us."

The stuffiness would have them sweating like pigs, and he was unsure if the psychology of the grandiose sculptures, paintings and symbols would have much effect on such a powerful man.\n\nErnst von Siemens entered the room with a smile. The Grey Eminence, Bormann thought to himself smugly. The man's demeanour was lifeless and grey. His hair was thinning and grey. His suit, ill-fitting and grey. Yet, embedded in this figure of mediocrity were two sharp eyes, brimming with intelligence. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand we are mostly in agreement? Your corporation will aid the state in these deportations and the establishment of ghettos and camps throughout Europe. You have proven yourself to be a true National Socialist, and so you have my undying trust."\n\n"I am here to fulfil our agreement," von Siemens concurred, "and not to negotiate. The Siemens corporation is not rich enough to engage in the scale you were hinting at during our phone call, but we shall try our best." He leaned forwards, smiling gently. "I will make one thing absolutely certain. I will not budge on this at all. Siemens is the only German mega corporation tolerated in the international community, because we haven't engaged in the same levels of slavery as our competitors. These territories, ghettos, camps - whatever you call them, I want them officially covered up by the state. Agree to this, and the deal is done.""

The stuffiness would have them sweating like pigs, and he was unsure if the psychology of the grandiose sculptures, paintings and symbols would have much effect on such a powerful man.\n\nFriedrich Flick entered the room with a frown on his jowly face. He was an old man with a dark brown suit too large for his slender frame, and two untrusting eyes that surveyed the room with suspicion. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "I understand your apprehensions. You have benefitted immensely from slavery, and have many friends in high places who support it. Yet here I am proposing that you abet its gradual decline." Flick smiled politely, but said nothing. "As a cunning businessman, Herr Flick, you must understand that the continuation of slavery as it currently operates will drag down all aspects of our economy, including Daimler-Benz? This is an opportunity to not only serve your Reich and the cause of National Socialism, but to make a profit while doing so."\n\n"I want a larger offer of collateral," Flick finally spoke after a minute of intense silence. "I'm sure you will be happy to negotiate. After all, I have a good amount of resources for these camp constructions."\n\nBormann knew that appealing to the man's dual love of ideology and currency would sway him. He could probably be trusted, but nonetheless Bormann would ensure that a great level of oversight would be provided to Daimler-Benz's contribution to the Modern Wunderwaffe."

Were it not for his immaculate dark grey suit, Bormann would have mistaken the square jaw and beady eyes for those of an OrPo officer. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began. "Your hesitance is understandable. After all, Reichswerke is a huge company, and investing so much into the slave camps and ghettos poses an obvious risk."\n\n"I know it does," Edmund snapped back. "I travelled this way to hear your arguments, not mine. Reichswerke is rich and powerful, and will hugely benefit your plans. But why should I help you?"\n\n"Not as rich and powerful as IG Farben," Bormann responded, restraining his anger at the CEO's impudence. "Yet. Such a high risk project would yield a high reward, high enough to propel you far above your rivals. When people talk of corporate giants, it is Edmund Geilenberg they shall think of - not Hermann Josef Abs."\n\nThe man's beady eyes lit up in interest. Bormann had to proceed with caution. He knew what a risky partner Reichswerke would make, and effective oversight would be difficult to maintain."

The stuffiness would have them sweating like pigs, and he was unsure if the psychology of the grandiose sculptures, paintings and symbols would have much effect on such a powerful man.\n\nHermann Josef Abs strolled into the room with a mischievous grin. He was a portly man with a greying mustache and a black three-piece suit. Bormann offered a seat to the man, and the two slumped down into large comfortable armchairs.\n\n"We have discussed much over the phone," Bormann began.\n\n"Cigar?" Abs interjected, opening his case. Bormann stared into the businessman's cunning eyes, unfazed, and accepted. The two men puffed deeply on their thick cigars and filled the room with smoke. "I was most intrigued by your offer. IG Farben, naturally, is the largest corporation in Europe. We have the most resources to utilize for your... projects. Unfortunately, slavery has been a large part of our success, if your plans for economic revival fail, then so will my company. I will need many, many subsidies and assurances if you expect me to agree to this deal."\n\n"Then there is much to negotiate," Bormann replied, blowing more smoke into the air. Abs was a ruthless businessman, one whose help would almost guarantee an improved economy. Of course, if the Modern Wunderwaffe initiative proved successful, Abs and IG Farben would only grow more powerful.\n\n"Let us begin. My Führer." His tone was almost mocking."

Forced to stay on his feet for hours on end, constantly on the move, and even sometimes hearing the crack of a whip followed by a pained yell that always accompanied it. Life was not easy in Łódź - at least, that's what it used to be called. Now it was called Litzmannstadt, which the 47-year-old man found to be a horrific butchering of one of Poland's cities. Yet he could do nothing about it. Only toil and toil, until his body gave out.\n\nHe had worked in a car plant before for some company he never got the name of, but apparently the higher-ups decided that he was 'worthy'. Worthy of what - dying before 50 from overworking himself to death? The other men around him were much younger than he was, and the slightest suspicion came to him that he was merely an administrative error. No matter. He had railroad tracks to lay, work to do, a life to keep. Even if it was a hollow and meaningless one.\n\nOne day, Antonin came to work and saw that a young man had come up to him - Aleksy, he was called. A bright man, he was. A shame the Germans didn't look at him that way.\n\n"Mister Antonin!" He shouted, calling the man to attention. "Mister Antonin, have you heard the news?"\n\nHe sighed, tempted to give Aleksy a taste of black humor, but relented. He didn't have to be a depressive man to be around. "What is it, Mister Aleksy?" He asked, half-curious and half-not, but the younger man seemed excited.\n\n"They're tellin' us..." He rubbed the back of his neck. "Well... I've heard, I guess, that some of us might go back to Poland. Live with our own!" The heavy steel that creaked Antonin's back was set down on the floor as Antonin gave him a glare shot with both concern and copious amounts of distrust. Aleksy could immediately feel some of his happiness begin dispersing.\n\n"Boy...""

 bor_econ.107.d:0 "There was a reason there was a saying for it. Like rivers, the great streams of Europe's infrastructure controlled the ebb and flow of people and resources into the estuary of Rome. Caesar had seized an Empire with symbols and blood, but Rome kept an empire with roads. When all roads lead to Rome, victory can only travel in one direction. However, even the mightiest of Empires fall, and Rome fell to none other than the Germans themselves. Decadence and degeneracy had gripped the nation, much like it gripped Europe before the Germans wrestled rightful control back over the continent.\n\nOne man can't rule an Empire, though if any man could, Bormann knew it was him. Regrettably, he had to share the reins with the petty Führers of the Reichskommissariats. It was these individuals that he needed to build the roads to his new Rome. Goethe had called Rome the 'capital of the world', but that title belonged to Germania now, and it was time the economic flows of the continent reflected it.\n\nBormann entered the Volkshalle's main meeting room to find the bickering dukes of the Reich's colonies suddenly standing to attention. 'Heil Bormann!' The Führer nodded approvingly, and sat down. The Reichskommissars followed.\n\nThe plan was laid out. Infrastructure projects across the Reichskommissariats would be built to ensure the direction of power went to the Reich. Germany must remain the undisputed hegemon of Europe, lest it fall back into the liberal decadence Hitler rescued it from. Railways, oil pipelines, electricity grids. "Think of it like integration," Bormann said. "The Reich and her allies combined to become more powerful collectively than they could ever imagine separately."\n\nBormann added a final touch. "Of course, for their own defensive purposes, the Reichskommissariats would be wise to collaborate with the most powerful military in Europe," the Führer stated. "Germania's enemies fear her for a reason."\n\nFor a second each, Bormann made eye contact with the Reich's Dukes, making sure they understood what he meant. Satisfied with his work, the Führer rose, and exited the room."

More accurately, this involves giving a lot of scientists a lot of money and hoping they come up with something. The best thing is, this strategy usually worked.\n\nBormann sometimes considered himself a man of science. He had massive respect for the discipline, and the great Aryan minds who had originated its every moment of progress. It was these minds who he had now bestowed a massive investment in; research and development firms across the Reich were now to receive government grants for every new project started. Germany was already indisputably the world's centre of science and thought, but the Führer knew it could be so much more.\n\nBeyond realising the German ideals of science and progress, Bormann understood that these investments would provide a massive boon to the German economy. As a centre of innovation, the Ruhr would now be able to compete with the best of California or Tokyo. This was just securing this reputation however.

In an effort to better bind the notoriously independently minded firms to his will, Führer Bormann has declared the introduction of a set of price controls and asserted that whilst raw material may be extracted by private firms, this material is property of the Reich and must be purchased at prices set by the Economic Ministry. Similarly all sales to the government will be made at predetermined prices.\n\nWhilst this would otherwise cause a colossal shortfall in revenue for these titans of industry, the price controls are accompanied by a generous plan of subsidies to make up the shortfall. Notable figures such as Hermann Josef Abs and Friedrich Flick are reported to have voiced their displeasure in private, though they have little recourse other than to bow to the Führer's wishes and continue business as usual, lest they want to find their firms dismantled and themselves behind bars.\n\nThe money will continue to flow, but every transaction now takes place one step closer to the government.

The ring of swiveling chairs faced one another in the centre, upholstered in garish orange, while the wood-panelled walls were festooned with screens and blinking lights. Whilst it was only a mockup, he could see the intention - surrounded by all the information of the Reich, he could pick up a figure with a swing of his legs and a spin - and it was far more organised a system than the mountains of paperwork he was usually inundated in. Even if it did look like he was captain of a spaceship.\n\n"And what exactly do these computers do that a person cannot? I have hundreds of economic planners working tirelessly towards the same goal."\n\nA glint appeared in the scientist's eye, one that Bormann recognised as that of a salesman who has been asked just the right question. He leaned forward in the uncomfortable chair. "That may be what they tell you, but no man can work without rest. If they give you their all you can get at most twelve hours a day at peak efficiency, and that's with toilet breaks, smoking breaks, lunch breaks. Cybersyn does not rest, does not eat, and has no opinion. It cannot deceive, or complain, or strike. It simply sees the figures and finds the pattern. A shortage of coal in the Rhineland will alert mines in the Ruhr, overproduction of ammunition in Prussia will be sent to Ukraine without even a phone call, and strikes in Silesia will be detected automatically and the central government informed."\n\nBormann leaned back. For a scientist, the man sure knew how to sell. If one couldn't trust a machine, what could one trust?"

He had instructed the men to ignore him, and they were doing their best, aside from the one whose chair Bormann occupied. He was doing his best not to glower at his Führer when he thought he wasn't looking. Their chairs revolved back and forth like repelling magnets as they called out percentages and figures - they seemed to not use words like "the" and "and", or indeed any of the words that were required to form a sentence, but nonetheless they seemed to understand one another implicitly. The room was almost identical to the mockup, with the exception of a number of ashtrays to contain the impressive amount of cigarettes the seven planners were going through.\n\nBormann kicked against the floor, sending his chair into a spin. He could indeed see practically anything he desired - production figures in Hamburg, unemployment in Munich, administrative expenses in Germania. Cybersyn had already performed an impressive cull on useless civil servants and streamlined production pipelines enough to pay for itself, and the engineers had been considering an expansion of its computing power to delegate yet more functions to the ever-expanding network of transistors.\n\nA future where he didn't need economists... Bormann sighed wistfully and kicked his chair into another spin. For a brief moment, science had gone up in his estimation. Except the owner of this chair. He would have to be disappeared. "

While Cybersyn's designers had done an impressive job with the Reich's finances it seemed they were far less adept at managing their own. With belt-tightening occurring across the Reich, funding had dried up, until Bormann had finally been notified the company had gone under.\n\nAt the outbreak of the crisis the Entscheidungsnetzwerk had been undergoing a period of upgrade and maintenance, with only limited operational capability.

Reichswerke however has subverted this obstacle by exchanging their goods directly for American dollars through shell corporations in Sweden, a close trading partner of the Reich that also maintains contact with the USA.

Then, he had begun to follow Peter on his walk home. Peter had long since passed his own house, even doubling back to try and lose the unknown figure. Steadily, however, the man continued to tail him.\n\n Peter was unsure what this could be about. He was only an accountant. He had no rivals that would have sent a man after him, and no mugger would be this dedicated to a single mark. His wife, Elise, had protested against Hindenburg's coalition with the NSDAP, but that was years ago, before even the war had been won. Surely they could not be seeking revenge for that, after Elise had proven herself dedicated to Germany in the years since. Was this all because Peter had previously worked for Erhard, Speer's man?\n\nIn the back of his mind, however, Peter knew what had occurred, what they had found out. Years ago, before the collapse, he and Elise had hidden a young Jewish girl in their basement. It had just been  for a few weeks while Elise's brother had been under investigation. They had promised Peter that it would never be tied back to him, and that he would be saving a young girl's life. Peter bit his lip, continuing to walk aimlessly. If he returned home, it was possible he would be condemning his own children to death as well."

Without his jingoistic nonsense, the Führer had thought, the discontent in the military would be so insignificant as to be negligible. It appeared that hadn't been the case.\n\n Speidel seemed to have taken to the faulty narrative that it had been the reformists who had won this victory for the Reich. When Bormann had received word of his boasting and posturing, he had nearly ground his teeth to the grit. He had frankly no idea how Speidel had won over support by preaching such blatant cowardice, but it was something that needed to be dealt with all the same.\n\n He decided that what was needed was an appeal to the conservative faction, the silent majority that Bormann knew made up most of the OKW. In celebrating their victory over Schörner, the Führer would be certain to condemn all radicals alike, and express above all how Schörner too had pushed for the Reich to change. Speidel may have had a loud mouth, but he would not be able to stand up to a true challenge from the Reich's finest. Bormann would stamp out the last of the militarists, and in the process, paint Speidel as Schörner's liberal mirror image. Both, however different they claimed to be, would lead to collapse."

He had even allowed himself to imagine that Bormann would be praising Speidel and his men for the good work they had done in the name of the Reich. However, it seemed the Führer had other plans for this address.\n\n He had first begun discussing Schörner's treason, yes, but he had quickly taken a turn into more unexpected political venues. "When our soldiers pledge their loyalty to the Reich and to Hitler, they attempt to place their actions on the Reich and the Great Führer himself. They are not able to defend themselves against madmen, and as such, lunatics like Schörner are able to bastardize their ideals by professing that their treason is done in the Reich's name, or to fulfill Hitler's vision. From now on, all soldiers are to pledge loyalty only to the Führer. After all, the Führer is Hitler's successor, and his will is the will of the Reich. All else is unnecessary."\n\n Speidel's jaw dropped, the man in awe. The arrogance and self-absorption it required was astounding. For a moment, he considered walking off stage, or verbally condemning Bormann, though he knew such thoughts were  scandal and folly. All he could do was simply stand beside the man, making it clear by his frown and furrowed brow that he did not endorse this move. He would never renounce the oaths he had sworn to the German people and German nation, no matter what Bormann said. But as the crowd erupted into applause, it was all Speidel could do to keep himself composed. The masses loved a tyrant, it seemed."

It appeared that hadn't been the case.\n\n Schörner, that jingoistic bastard, had taken the opportunity to show that the Reich was vulnerable without its military. Bormann knew he had been boasting about Speidel's destruction as if it were all his doing, and that fact infuriated Bormann to no end. A thick headed goon with less power than he had brains, claiming the accomplishments of the Führer as his own! Bormann had to resist the urge to call him to his office and curse him out, though he muttered obscenities nonetheless.\n\n Bormann began to write missive after missive. He could not allow Schörner to consolidate power, that was for certain. They would need to find a way to discredit the man. Naturally, he could not be permitted to retain his position as Chief of the OKW, but Bormann also figured that, whilst they were cracking down on the Reformists, they could perhaps happen to find evidence of sympathies on some of Schörner's associates.

He had an infuriating habit of doing that.\n\n The Führer was unmoved. "Herr Schörner, I'm afraid you are needed elsewhere. You have served dutifully as Chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, as you say, and I imagine you will be able to further serve the Reich in…" Bormann took a moment to relish the look on Schörner's face. "Another position. Once we find one worthy of your degree and talents, of course. Perhaps something in Moscow, or the Ukraine." The smugness in the Führer's offer was hard to miss.\n\n "Damn you." Schörner suddenly snapped, having lost his patience with Bormann's taunts. He stood, revealing his whole height to the seated Führer. "First you remove the army's pledge to the Reich and Hitler, for no cause but to inflate your own damn ego. Now, you dismiss the man who kept Speidel from stringing you up outside the Volkshalle. Is it an army you want, or a mad pack of dogs who will sit for any fucking man who offers them a treat?"\n\n Bormann did not rise, instead eyeing the man up and down from his seat.

Now, there was a completely and utterly different company, Reich's Industrial Holdings, that just so happened to coincidentally own the exact assets once owned by Reichswerke, and, just as coincidentally, happened to be completely and utterly personally subservient to the Führer. As the mythical Atlas held the sky, so too did Reichswerke, and as Reichswerke held the sky, so too must Bormann. However, Bormann was no Atlas, and none of the physical care routines his doctors put him through gave him quite the strength to hold up the sky - as such, he had to get help.\n\n60% of Reichswerke - now RIH - was to be sold off to the highest bidders. These were not as friendly as Bormann would like, as it just so happened that the highest bidders, with uncomfortable frequency, happened to like reform, but Bormann had no alternatives, and no excuses for turning down the reformists' offers. Still, the 40% share remaining within NSDAP control was more than enough for him to control Reichswerke, to control Atlas, to control the sky, and it was quite to his satisfaction."

Getting in was easy - it was quite fortunate that Germania's elite has spectacularly bad taste - just wear their vomit-worthy fashion,look rich, and act like an asshole, and you're in.\n\nGetting into the establishment was easy, and getting the blackmail was even easier. Jung found a table with a fair few rich-looking men that were visibly a few drinks in, and decided to invite himself to their table. Then, spending the Orpo's generous mission budget on rounds for the bunch, the rest got progressively drunker, never noticing that Jung seemed quite reluctant to partake in the drinks himself.

Now opening the letter…\n\nDO NOT OPPOSE THE FÜHRER read giant, bold letters. What, did the Orpo have mind reading devices now?

They knew he didn't like how slaves were treated, didn't like the Führer, didn't like much that had to do with the NSDAP. Well, that was unfortunate, but unsurprising, as his political views were a pretty open secret with the Germania elites.\n\nNow, the third page and beyond, that was trouble. No text, just pictures, more than enough to tell a thousand words. Bruises on various women, women that he recognized, women that he had nights with that were pleasant for him, and unpleasant for them. A thousand nights of justifying to himself his actions ran through his head - well, he hurt just a few dozen, while those NSDAP officials hurt millions! God, that didn't matter now, did it?

Such a rude act doubtless spoke to the severity of the upcoming topic.\n\n"Heil Bormann," Gehlen panted with a salute before placing the briefcase onto the desk and pulling out a vast assortment of documents, folders and tapes. He finally sat down, took a deep breath, and stared at Bormann straight in the eyes. "My Führer, what I am about to say is a consequence of both research and speculation." He adjusted his square glasses. "I have reason to believe there is an internal conspiracy against your leadership. A conspiracy within the Government itself."

Were the conspirators aiding him in return for his support? It didn't matter. Gehlen was, naturally, going to have to rely on slightly less authentic intel. It wouldn't be the first time he had fabricated evidence, and he doubted it would be his last.\n\nHeinrich Müller, Chief of the Ordnungspolizei and embezzler of funds!

 bor_disII_preparation.1.desc:0 "Gehlen's desk was overflowing with paperwork, yet he was undeterred. With his new position, he was privy to every secret the Orpo held - at least nominally. He had to admit a grudging admiration for his predecessor. Müller had defined the Ordnungspolizei in it's modern role, transitioning it from one of many policing and security organizations to the dominant intelligence agency within the Reich. It was almost a tragedy to undo so much of his work, but the Führer demanded results and Gehlen had resolved to be the man to deliver them.\n\nHis first action, as dictated by Bormann himself, was a total restructuring of the organization under his leadership - and how could he refuse such an offer? The power of the pencil-pusher was an oft underestimated one. With but a flick of his pen he could remove Müller's most trusted men from contact with one another and send them to opposite ends of the Reich. Yes, with this newfound control he could begin the task of digging out conspiracy root and stem. The Führer would hear only good things from now on - he would make sure of it."

Many Germans have instead resorted to cycling or walking to work - if they have work to return to. The economic slump has resulted in upwards of a million Germans losing their jobs."\n\nBormann turned off his television with a sigh. He was receiving more flak than was fired in the Battle of Britain, and this crisis wasn't even his fault! He should have expected this crash as soon as the Italians established their empire.

He curled his right hand into a fist and pounded the desk in silence. One. Twice. Three times.\n\n"Müller, that treacherous fucking SCUM!" The desk was stained with blood, but he kept pounding. "Gehlen set me up, didn't he? They all set me up!" He suddenly grabbed the phone and launched it at the window with a scream of unbridled fury. It smashed the glass into pieces and went soaring into the air. "You're one of them, aren't you Walther? Right under my nose, sneaking around like a little Jew!" Panting heavily, Bormann threw open his desk shelf and wrenched out a pistol. "All of you! Reinhard, Kurt, Gerhard, you're all fucking traitors! I have dedicated my whole fucking life to this! I have dedicated EVERYTHING!"\n\nHe roared and fired. Hewel grabbed his side with a scream and stumbled to the floor. OrPo officers raced inside and tore the pistol from the Führer's hands, leading him out of the door.\n\n"We must leave now, my Fuhrer," one of them barked. "Niklas, go to Hewel's aid! Now!""

A sudden explosion from far below tore through all other sounds, and sent Bormann staggering back in shock. The guards kept him moving.\n\nThe gunshots were louder now. Bormann barged into the securely locked panic room and raced inside. The initial room led into a secret tunnel where the getaway car awaited him. It had been cleaned and inspected almost every day for the last decade, but he had never expected it to come into use. He instinctively touched his chest and felt the cigarette pack sewn into his brown shirt. Four cigarettes and one cyanide capsule were squeezed together like sardines in a tin.\n\nHe heard the clatter of something metallic. Black smoke began to sneak under the hidden door.

The cacophony of shouts and jeers drew to a close as the President of the Reichstag rose to his feet.\n\n"In accordance with our emergency vote, and in light of the Führer's sudden disappearance, the Chief of the Party Chancellery Baldur von Schirach will hereby be named as the new Führer of the Großgermanisches Reich."\n\nThe members of the Reichstag rose in applause like a strong brown wave. Von Schirach took the Fuhrer's podium and cleared his throat.\n\n"Members of the Reichstag. Friends and allies. Like the Hephaestus of Greek mythology, Martin Bormann has been cast down from Mount Olympus, though not for any deformity, but plotting against the sacred institutions of our Reich!"

"The sales will skyrocket when this law comes into effect."\n\n"It was a stroke of genius to lift those smoking restrictions, my Führer," Gerhard Klopfer nodded eagerly. He sucked on the cigar and exploded into a fit of coughs. Von Schirach rolled his eyes.\n\n"After the horrors of the Bürgerkrieg, the people need some relief," Bormann smirked. "It just so happens that the will of the people is the will of the Führer." He took another puff and turned to Werner Naumann, who had opted not to smoke. "Werner, I want the RMVP to start producing pro-smoking propaganda. Reverse our stance completely, but connect it to the late Führer.

He was a pretentious intellectual and a career politician, yes, but nonetheless a dedicated National Socialist and a competent administrator. Bormann had been swift in naming him the new Parteikanzler.\n\n"The Party Chancellery is a beast that needs wrangling in times of peace and stability," Bormann chuckled, tearing at his steak with a long sharp knife. "Let alone following a Civil War. As we rebuild our nation, so must we rebuild the Party and the State."\n\n"The Bürgerkieg will not soon leave our national consciousness," von Schirach sighed sadly. "To quote Lewis Carroll: 'If seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year, do you suppose, the Walrus said, that they would sweep it clear? I doubt it, said the Carpenter, and shed a bitter tear.'"\n\n"It will not be easy," Bormann continued, ignoring the effeminate aristocrat's tangent. "You will have to manage all Party affairs.

All three wore the title as a badge of honor.\n\nHoffmann and Friedrichs accepted their new assignment as Baldur von Schirach's deputies, and left the room with fervent salutes. Gerhard Klopfer stayed behind, politely waiting for Bormann to finish his cigar. He was a slender, somewhat skeletal man with two sunken eyes and a flop of greying hair swept over his bulging forehead.\n\n"Gerhard," Bormann finally spoke up. "You have served me well for many years, without complaint or restraint. You represented me faithfully during the Endlösung conference, and shot down any arguments against the extermination of our enemies. Not once have you faltered.

"I want them swinging from nooses in the centre of Germania."\n\n"My Führer, I hear rumors that you plan to pardon the Feldmarschall?" Baldur von Schirach placed the wooden pipe into his mouth and began to puff, eyes unblinking. Not many people dared to stare at Bormann in such a provocative manner. The aristocrat's newfound power had clearly gone to his head. Bormann glared back in silence.\n\n"We have pardoned many talented Militarist officers and soldiers," Burgdorf replied quickly, slicing through the sudden tension. "The Wehrmacht would be severely weakened without them, especially following such a catastrophic Civil War."\n\n"More importantly, pardoning Schörner would control him," Bormann explained. "If Schörner feels like he and his movement have a modicum of influence, he will be little more than a thorn in our side. If we execute him, we create a martyr for the Militarists to rally behind.""

"I can't give a speech to save my life."\n\n"One more thing, my Führer," Klopfer continued hesitantly. "We received a report from Heinrich Müller and the Ordnungspolizei. Josef Terboven has been located and arrested. What are your orders?"\n\nBormann tore his eyes from the speech and curled his lip. Terboven, that little rat.

Gone were the salutes and the respect. Gone was the fear of sudden assassination, for he knew exactly when and where he would be killed, and for some reason it calmed his beating heart. Terboven had sacrificed everything to help Bormann in the Bϋrgerkrieg and abandon the useless experiment in Norway, and now Bormann had responded to his efforts.\n\nTerboven saw the gallows. His heart jumped into his mouth.\n\n"N-no..." he gasped, legs trembling. "I thought... a firing squad..."\n\n"We received very simple instructions," one of the men pulling him to his fate replied.

He could never have asked for a more loyal wife. Their thoughts had aligned on policy, on ideology, on life itself. He smiled to himself. Gerda. She had been so supportive of his sexual exploits, always encouraging him to aim higher every week.\n\nShe had been a useful tool, faithful and beautiful, delivering ten of his Aryan children into this cruel world until mercury poisoning took her in 1946. Seven of these children were still alive. Three daughters, married off to bear his grandchildren as dutiful housewives. Four sons, each educated in matters of politics and culture by the Party Academy in Matrei am Brenner. He had not inquired as to the fate of his eldest son, Martin Jr, who had joined the Afrika Korps. The man was either celebrating his survival or rotting in a ditch. Either way, he had served the Reich well.\n\nAs Führer, he could not risk any scandalous affairs or acknowledge any bastard children, and so slept in a cold and empty bed every single night, undisturbed by the whispers of a woman or the cry of a child.

 bormannflavor.8.desc:0 "The funeral was a somber affair, even more so than they usually are. The silence was pierced by quiet mumbling of the assembled crowd, mostly revolving around new arrivals noticing the flag draping the coffin was not the Reichsbanner or that of Prussia, but the old coat of arms of the city, filling the assembled hearts with sorrowful memories. The black eagle adorning that banner, not clasping the symbol of the darkness that had descended upon Germany for over thirty years, was a remnant of an era lost, of opportunities slipped between the fingers of all of those present, including the man within the coffin. The elder statesmen filling the Cologne Cathedral reflected on this and more, falling silent as the priest began the service for Konrad Adenauer.\n\nOutside the Cathedral, the mood was far less muted. A crowd of thousands surrounded the building, clustering around loudspeakers transmitting the service from inside, the devout Catholics and elderly conservatives struggling to hear it over the loud debates, conversations and occasional shouted slogans of the student protesters intermingling with them. The funeral was not just a symbol of a Germany lost, but also of a spirit of hope for the future, in the mind of many of the attendees. The rings of police surrounding the crowd disagreed, many of them clearly itching for any excuse to break up the protest masquerading as a funeral. That excuse was about to be delivered them.\n\nThe crowd gasped as the Weimar tricolor rolled down the face of the Cathedral, unfolding to cheers from the students, then turning to joyful chants. Many of the older or more experienced people in the crowd tried to hush them or make their way out, but it was too late. The cheers turned to screams as tear gas grenades exploded among them and gas masked officers rushed in with clubs and cattle prods.\n\nSeveral hundred kilometers away, a phone rang in the Führer's office.

Yet, the man hesitated. The Führer gave a tired sigh. "What is it, Wilfred?"\n\n"There is... another matter, mein Führer. While you were having your luncheon earlier, a letter arrived to the Chancellery. From the stamps I believe it is from one of the military intelligence services. It only reads 'Revised Information Summary Regarding High Value Individual' though."\n\nBorman peaked up, his interest captured. "Did you show anyone else?"\n\n"No mein Führer, besides the mailroom clerk and the senior secretariat nobody knows. As you've told me to do with sensitive materials, I especially kept it away from the girls."\n\n"Good, their loyalty is dubious. I can tell in their eyes after they have been to see me. Fetch the letter, I will review it immediately."\n\nMinutes later Bormann had the crisp blue thickgrain paper of the envelope in his hands, eagerly cutting it open with a letter knife. The document inside was however very thin and slightly yellowed, the ink of the letters a light grey from low pressure typing intended to preserve the paper. Air mail. Bormann knew it was from one of the African RKs before even seeing the stamp of the Abwehr Afrikaabteilung. His eyes scanned the document rapidly, skimming most of the text. SS defector... highly reliable... Hitlerstadt contacts... There it was, EBER. Zentralafrika. The Führer didn't need to check his list of codenames to know who EBER was.

Müller tensed momentarily; old soldier's reflexes however quickly faded into resentful relaxation. He rolled his weight in his creaky chair and stamped his boots to create an impression of standing up, then gave a half-hearted "Heil Bormann! How can I help you, mein Führer?"\n\nEven through the crackle of the international line, Bormann's voice seethed with cold fury. "Mind your tone, Müller. Your friends in Germania would not mind me promoting you to Reichskommissar for Moskowien once we restore order in the area."\n\nMüller's grin faded. "Understood, mein Führer. How may I serve the Reich?"\n\n"Göring. I know you have him cooped up somewhere down there. I assume I do not need to tell you the punishment for harboring an enemy of the Reich?"\n\nMüller's grip tightened around the phone. Of course he knew of Göring, he was not the idiot playboy most people took him as. He had known since the second a group of Prussian refugees had paid him far too well for a ship up the Congo and a mansion in Hitlerstadt; his mercenaries had the whole journey watched. Both leverage with the refugees and a way to stick it to that bald, sanctimonious prick who now called himself Führer. But how much did Bormann know? Was it worth the risk keeping Göring?"

I will have some experts flown down to assist your men in the arrest of the possibly dangerous individuals he have no doubt brought with him. I expect prompt results, Müller, your position may depend on it."\n\nHanging up, he could not suppress a grin and barely stopped himself from drumming a cheery tune on his desk.

While his thoughts were a blurry mess of sorrowful memories and regrets, he barely even registered the banging at the front door at first, but when he heard a guard cry out in alarm before disappearing in a storm of what he recognized as gunshots even in his current state, Göring stumbled to his feet. The French! The French were attacking the aerodrome! Why had that fool Reinhard not ordered the planes up before they got this close? He tried to concentrate. Small arms fire, not fighters. Damn, he needed a pistol! Where... ah yes, of course, his coat! Scrambling to the closet, he found his hat and coat, to his relief with his trusty Luger in it. Putting on the clothes as best he could, he stumbled towards the office door and towards the sounds of combat downstairs.\n\nGöring emerged at the top of the staircase, firing a shot blindly at one of the blurry soldiers battling below. He noted with satisfaction that the figure grunted and fell over, before taking aim at another figure. Click. He looked with confusion at his weapon. Why would he have loaded his gun with only one bullet? With a dissatisfied grunt he made his way back to the office. Maybe there were some rounds in a desk drawer.\n\nLocating something small and round in the top drawer of the desk, Göring decided to pull aside the office curtains for light. The sweeping vista of Lake Congo nearly blinded him, but also caused the memories to come flooding back. Like in a haze, he looked at the pill in his hand. Oh. As the sounds of combat drew closer, Göring knew what he had to do to win one last victory. Trembling, he put the pill between his teeth."

His own Belgians followed close behind, to give fire support against the militarist hardliners who had followed their leader into exile. His lieutenant was in the process of giving him an order when a pistol bullet had ripped through his gut. Atop the staircase on Marcel's left, the former Reichsmarschall had stood, wildeyed and with a half-buttoned greatcoat on, despite the African heat. For whatever reason, he never put a second shot in Marcel, but retreated to his office. The young man's heart had been pounding the entire rest of the battle, until they stormed Göring's office. Luckily for them there was no casualties in taking the man into arrest, as he was already dead by the time they arrived.\n\nHe turned to the officer from Germania, who was ordering the other mercenaries and soldiers from the Heimat to grab shovels. "You wanted to see us, Hauptmann?"\n\n"Indeed, Herr Dupont. You and Herr Woynitz here were the ones to find the traitor's suicide note. Please sign this document."\n\nMarcel frowned as he signed the peace of paper on Klaus' back. "There was a suicide note?"\n\n"Of course, Herr Bucard, you read it yourself. He wrote of how radical militarists had strung him along to betray the rightful Führer, and he killed himself in shame over all the devastation and chaos he had brought to the Reich.

The thought of Hüttig made Bormann think again about the letter he had gotten. The only supposed witness to Göring's arrival in Africa had been one of Hüttig's SS-men, and Bormann knew well enough how Hüttig loathed Müller, constantly writing the Reich Chancellery with requests for his removal from office. Could the bastard have been trying to play the Führer for a fool, the puppet in his games? Bormann's anger grew as he kept convincing himself he had been used and humiliated by the Himmler-loving freak in Quelimane.\n\nWithin the hour, the African Abwehr had been ordered to refocus their efforts on Hans Hüttig for suspected sedition, with only a small increase in resources for the monitoring of Müller."

In his mind, the advantages and disadvantages were clear: the American government would always be an enemy, with or without a political assassination, while Speer had to die. An advantage without any drawback.\n\nWith a look of contempt, the Führer tossed the letter into the dustbin, and returned to his activities.

Everyone could be a traitor, even without him knowing, even against his will, and it is the Führer's duty to ensure that such dangerous elements are properly dealt with.\n\nThis and many other thoughts agitate Martin Bormann's mind, as he reads of the rebirth of one of his most hated enemies. The occultist sects, degenerate gatherings of misbegotten people bent to foreign influence and irrational beliefs, had been banned almost thirty years ago thanks to his personal intervention, but now they have risen once more: sprouting as fungi on a rotting trunk, these parasites threaten once more the purity of the Aryan people...\n\nAs he crunches the papers in his hand, he already knows the answer to a thousand unspoken questions. Heinrich Himmler - the snake! - has always been a devotee of the occultist creed, and many prominent officials kept practising their debauched ways under his wing even after the Hess-Aktion, kept away from righteous punishment by the powerful SS-Führer: ever since the Ordensstaat was created, Himmler had dropped all pretense of compliance to the German law, and now everyone can see the fruits of his criminal intent.\n\nThere is no time to be lost. Every new occult circle is an eye from which Himmler can spy on the Reich, every new acolyte a potential minion: these tumors must be excised immediately and without hesitation. As Bormann calls his secretary, he already knows what he needs to do: all occult clubs will be banned once more, as will all the petty superstitions such as esoterism, homeopathy and its many pseudo-medical ramifications. All the leaders will be arrested on sight, and the other members identified by the Orpo for... future use."

It was worth the risk, Arnošt thought, to be certain that the film was perfect before he sent it off the next day. He had watched the thing three times already, but he knew that if even one mistake had slipped through, he would have failed in his duty.\n\nThe film began with a video that Arnošt's family had taken at the Zapust, when Arnošt had been only a child. Finding this video in his attic had been the motivation for the entire project. Intently watching the screen, Arnošt heard himself describe the tradition in German, as voices chattered beneath him in the Sorbian language. Next, Arnošt listened as his father, a historian, discussed the history of the Sorbs and watched his local community celebrate the Mass. He had been forced to use many older videos, as he did not wish to draw the ire or suspicion of the Wendenabteilung. If this passion project of Arnošt's got out, there was little telling what would happen to those who had agreed to participate in it.\n\nSuddenly, Arnošt froze. There was someone coming down the chapel steps. The air in the room disappeared for a moment, and the young filmmaker sat perfectly still. The only sound remaining was the projector humming gently, displaying a video of Arnošt's mother decorating eggs for Easter. And then, whoever had ventured down to the basement began to recede upwards. Arnošt let his breath free as Beautiful Lusatia began to softly play.

Thomas couldn't decide which of the villains he hated more. There was the Bolshevik dressed in red, Speer, always trying to sabotage all the good people's work; the crazy half-human half-rabid dog, Göring, the foam from his mouth spilling constantly spilling out over all three of his chins; and how could Thomas ever forget Heydrich, the marionette pulled around and controlled by the devilish schemers off-screen?

Thomas sliced into the air along with Bormann with his toy sword, and couldn't help but snicker as the camera zoomed in on Speidel's face, crying pathetically as he was about to crash into the tundra. 'Heil Zeit!' played after that, and Thomas sang and saluted along, just like always. There was only one picture of Hitler this time; all the rest were of Bormann. Thomas preferred it that way. Hitler was Germany's saviour once, but Bormann was the new saviour. He deserved the credit. "Heil Hitler!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Bormann!", "Heil Bormann!". "Heil Bormann!", "Heil Bormann!"."

 bormannflavor.42.desc:0 "Thomas was a bit too old for cartoons now. He had a younger brother, though, Roland, and his mother was always telling him to spend more time with the kid. It wasn't that Thomas had anything against him, of course he loved his own little brother, but Roland was just such a kid. He did nothing but play with his toys and watch dumb cartoons, and Thomas didn't want to be seen doing anything so immature at his age. Most of the time when Thomas and Roland hung out, Thomas would just read quietly or do homework while his brother watched his shows. The only time Thomas paid any attention was when one show in particular was on, his own childhood favourite. Roland seemed to like it just as much as he did, and hanging out with his brother gave Thomas an excuse to see where the show had gone. Mostly it was the same drivel, the perfect good guy Bormann facing off against a bunch of cartoonishly evil villains and always winning. This time the episode was about the Oil Crisis. Bormann was helping the German army fight against its vague enemies in the Middle East, riding through the sand on a white horse with a golden lance. The show looked different from when he used to watch it every day. Still, though, it brought back memories for Thomas, and made him feel like a kid again.\n\nWhen the 'Heil Zeit!' started, the minute of what Thomas now realized was pure propaganda that ended off each episode, Thomas wasn't sure if he was going to join in. He knew Roland would. Getting to scream at the top of your lungs for a minute without your parents getting mad at you was half the appeal of the Heil Zeit, but for Thomas it was more about nostalgia. Would it still feel as good as it always did before? Would any of his friends figure out about it somehow, and pick on him for acting like a little kid? Thomas knew that Bormann wasn't just a cartoon hero now, too. He was in charge of the country, and Thomas had heard his parents sharing a few choice words about the man over coffee in the mornings. When the Heil Zeit started, though, and Roland joined in with the heil-ing as the montage of portraits of Bormann scrolled by in rapid succession, Thomas felt he had to put at least one in. This had been his favourite show for years, after all. Waiting until the very end, when the last portrait of the Führer lingered for a few extra seconds, Thomas bonded with his little brother and gave one last 'heil' to his childhood hero.

He saw a show playing that he used to watch all the time when he was a kid. Some shitty propaganda cartoon, with a whole minute at the end dedicated to swearing loyalty to Bormann. The episode seemed to heavily feature Baldur von Schirach, who they depicted being artlessly kicked the crap out of by Bormann, who was still wearing that same damn antique suit of armour Tomas remembered from the old days. Grinning, Thomas gave a little laugh. Not with the show, but at it. He couldn't believe he ever used to like this crap. When he was a kid, he used to feast on the Nazi's propaganda like a starving man on a bowl of stew. He didn't see the world so simplistically anymore.\n\nBormann, the same dictator he had printed on his lunchbox when he was a child, was only getting older and more incompetent by the year. The country was suffering, people were dying, nothing was changing for the better, and Thomas had finally wised up to reality. The stories he'd been told on TV were all lies. The Führer wasn't a hero, saving Germany from the Bolshevik menace. He was just an incompetent buffoon with a sadistic streak, no different from all the other Nazi dickheads. Thomas' mother seemed to hate Bormann too, but his father was iffy about him. He always talked down to Thomas about joining in on protests, worried he'd get himself or the family in trouble. Getting in trouble himself didn't worry Thomas much, but he was a little concerned the Nazis might go after his parents if he kept demonstrating. Maybe the sick bastards would even target his little brother Roland, if they were feeling especially awful that day. Whatever the consequences, though, Tomas knew he was doing the right thing. He heard the doorbell ring, and quickly turned off the TV, grabbing his jacket and placard and heading out to join his friends and drive over to the protest. Someone had to stick up to the fascists, and apparently it had to be them. As they drove along, Thomas and his friends heard some bootlicker praising Bormann on the radio, and broke into a chant to drown him out. "Fuck Bormann!", "Fuck the Nazis!". "Fuck Bormann!", "Fuck the Nazis!". "Fuck Bormann!", "Fuck the Nazis!"."

Others would worship the Wehrmacht above all, seeking to turn our Reich into a mindless animal, lashing out at all around it. These false ideas and the traitors that held them have been justly excised from our Reich."

"But they all failed to see the true problem that plagued us. The only one of our great internal enemies that yet lingers on. Heinrich Himmler and his servants in Paris!"

Ironically, it was the limits imposed on their state by Germania that had doomed them. The skeleton army permitted by Hitler had no chance of resisting Himmler's SS, and their downfall had been in many ways inevitable since the last Führer's passing.\n\nStill, it would not do to meekly accept their downfall at the hands of our new enemies. The rebellious SS-Ordensstaat might occupy a lion's share of former French territory, but France still lives on in the south, and we are better throwing our lot in with them than permitting Himmler to rule over his fiefdom unchallenged. The Reich shall issue a formal declaration, to France and to all nations, firmly denouncing Burgundy's invasion and refusing to recognize under any circumstances the territorial acquisitions of the SS during the German Civil War. Of course, simply saying as much will do nothing to reverse those acquisitions, but it will at least remind the French regime that we are their friends, and remind the whole world that it is not the Reich that is the black state polluting the face of Europe: it is Burgundy."

In return, they asked of us only to recognize the French State's claims against the bandit-state in Brittany, and to work together to see to the reunification of France and the end of the regime in Brest.\n\nThe Treaty of Bordeaux accomplishes these terms. With Bormann's signature, this treaty between our two nations promises to work together eternally to see to stronger relations between France and Germany, and the downfall of the illegal occupiers of Brittany. The Bretons and their backers will surely object, insisting that they are a sovereign, internationally recognized nation, with many men standing behind them to rebuff any assault. We are best off ignoring their cries. The French seem happy for us to recognize their claims irrespective of the infeasibility of delivering them, and so we are all too happy to sign their little treaty. It is of no real cost, and much symbolic benefit."

The tricolour flies from Marseilles to Brest once again, and the French now serve as a worthy counterweight to the unpredictable Burgundian menace. With so many German guns amongst the French troops, and so many Germany volunteers on the frontlines, Fall Rollo cannot merely be called a victory for France: it is a victory for the Reich too. Another corner of Europe has returned to the domination of an Aryan proxy, and our position in France is now immutable; the regime there would never act against us after such a success.

Any interruptions, even for good news, were liable to anger and frustrate him. Today's news was unambiguously not good.\n\n"My Führer?" the visitor sounded, nervously, as he entered Bormann's office. It smelled of tobacco and liquor, and Bormann himself was reclined in his chair, feet kicked up on his desk. He looked at the visitor suspiciously, eyeing his military uniform, antagonized by the mild inconvenience of this official's arrival.\n\n"Yes? What is it?" Bormann answered, busy with nothing but his cigarette. "I'm very busy."\n\n"The military official spoke calmly and carefully, not wanting to antagonize the Führer any further. "Führer, I've received word from French forces in Brittany. They are retreating back to the border. The Bretons have rebuffed their attack, and induced considerable casualties."

The main dilemma inside the OKW, however, is exactly what kind of assistance the Reich is to offer its French allies. One camp is of a mind that the greater participation Germany has in Fall Rollo, the codename for the invasion of Brittany, the better. They wish for the Reich to officially declare war against the Republic of Brittany, and to directly militarily participate in the invasion alongside the French State. Another camp, consisting of the more discrete members of the High Command, instead prefer merely offering war materiel, intelligence, and military training to the French State. Privately, some of the most pessimistic members of this fact whisper that containing German involvement preempts an international embarrassment for the Reich, should the operation come to naught.

The tree that the black eagle lives in is home to another nest, in which a careless and lazy bald eagle chick lives. The black eagle's mother makes sure her nest is strong and stable, and builds it on the thickest branch on the tree. The bald eagle's nest is built on the tallest branch, a thin little twig that juts out about the rest of the tree, from where the bald eagles look down on the black eagles.\n\nOne day, a great storm comes, turning the sky black with dark clouds, and shaking the tree on which both nests are perched. The black eagle chick stays safe in its nest, swaying only slightly, the chick safe underneath its mother's wings. The weaker and taller branch that the bald eagle's nest is built on sways wildly in the wind, and the bald eagle falls, unable to fly in the storm and plummeting to the ground unseen. The bald eagle chicken looks up at the sky and sees the dark clouds in the sky begin to form into the black sun sigil of the SS, illuminated by lightning. As climactic music plays, the bald eagle's branch snaps, and the nest and chick both fall down into the dark sky below.\n\nOnce the storm fades, the watching children witness that all of the branches on the tree broke off, except for the one: the strongest branch, which the black eagle mother had wisely picked. The black eagle mother talks to the children of Germany directly, telling them to listen to their elders and to stay safe and protected from the storms that might come to their own tree. The chick agrees, as it leaps out of its nest at its mothers behest and begins to fly for the first time, soaring amongst a bright blue sky."

Now having received eager confirmation from the French government, they were forwarded to Rome with little delay. Alongside them was a small Italian portfolio detailing how recent German moves towards reconciliation with the Breton state had driven a wedge into already strained Franco-German relations, prompting Bordeaux to look for new allies abroad with Italy being a major element in their considerations.\n\nThe document now sits on a polished desk in Rome, and two options have made themselves clear: To embrace France's desperation and solidify our relations with a new European ally or to abandon the French in their frantic search for allies. Both decisions will surely alter the balance of powers in Europe, allowing us to either dedicate resources to a new and willing bulwark against German influence or, on the other hand, to shun the Bordeaux government and consolidate our own sphere of influence against German aggression.

The current German Führer, Martin Bormann, is reportedly furious with the French for their disloyalty and has vowed punitive measures for defying the articles of the alliance the French claim the Germans have been ignoring almost since the start.

Himmler had never been a friend, but outwardly they had maintained a veneer of cordiality and respect. In reality, one had always tried to undermine the other, and both were locked into a Great Game for the control of the Party. This Game lasted well into the West Russian War and ended with the Reichsfuhrer's betrayal and the attempted SS coup. Now, Bormann thought, Himmler and himself were locked into a Cold War, one that was heating up every day that passed.\n\nHis cigar was close to burning his fingers. The Führer threw it in the ashtray and lit another one. He tried reading one of Hewel's documents, but his mind once again wandered to the past. The SS coup had been the perfect opportunity, the one sure way to get rid of Himmler and his cabal of mindless brutes. However, before Bormann could spring his trap, that little snake played his card. Hitler announced his plans for the creation of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund, and Bormann's protests amounted to nothing. The Reichsfuhrer of the SS had his own fiefdom, far from Martin's influence. A decade has passed, and the Shadow State remained, uncaring about the changes happening in the Fatherland. This situation was unsustainable, Bormann thought, and he had to gain the upper hand. No more could Himmler be allowed to rule his little realm with no consequences.\n\nThe Führer's entire office reeked of smoke now.

It was not long after that that the ultimate weapon of the Reich, the product of the world's greatest minds was detonated in Pearl Harbor, and the war came to a close.\n\nWhen the war ended, the world belonged to the Axis. There were no more Bolsheviks to conquer, and so in triumph came ruin to the Axis. No more unifying enemy, and no more reason to cooperate.

Most were irrelevant and, to be honest, quite boring, and he simply glanced over them to ensure there were no glaring signs of fabrication. After making his way through the stack, he finally came to something of interest.\n\n"JAPANESE DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION GOING WELL - EMBASSY BEING ESTABLISHED" ran across the top of the paper. Excellent to see that the Japanese trusted him for some reason, Bormann thought. An embassy needs phones, of course, so he would make sure the Reich sent phones. They technically weren't pre-bugged - they were just incredibly, incredibly easy to tap into, so there was no need to have findable bugs on them. Next, he needed to ensure the new transfers - spies very, very thinly veiled as diplomats - were settling in well.\n\n"Mein Führer," Ambassador Merkel said on the phone - one of the Japanese ones, for now - "diplomatic relations are going quite well, and the Japanese seem to trust us. Ambassador Kaneko had held a tea ceremony, and -"\n\n"You had tea with the degenerates? Christ. Anyway, that doesn't matter. Have the new transfers settled in?"\n\n"Yes, they have, but, forgive me mein Führer, they do not seem to have much experience in the way of diplomacy-"\n\n"That's fine, I have full faith they can do their assigned jobs well - and that job is not fucking having tea with vermin. Now, supplies such as phones are on the way to the Tokyo embassy. You will establish an embassy in Beijing next, am I clear? Make up whatever bullshit excuse is needed. These embassies will better the Reich. You are dismissed, now get back to work.""

They had requested to negotiate at a time of particular tension between Germania and Tokyo, yet arrived bearing champagne and the appearance of glad tidings. They saluted, shaking hands with the Japanese Prime Minister, and discussed possible German business ventures across the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nFor the past twenty years, the Sphere has remained closed off to foreign economic interests, particularly that of German and American origin; now, as some begin to predict the cracks to show, the presence of German private investment has become a warmer thought, particularly over matters of employment and resource development in Bengal and Southeast Asia. The representatives had brought with them graphs and documents, each to present the potential economic gain in welcoming German business in the East.\n\nAs the delegation chatted on, grinning with sly smiles and crow's feet, [JAP.GetLeader]'s eyes were locked on to the blazing red armbands wrapped around the representative's sleeves. He clenched his teeth; the dark black void of a swastika revolted him, as he thought about the ravaging chaos of German presence in Eastern Europe and Africa, as millions had been displaced, abused, and outright cleansed from the earth so the Führer could have his way.\n\nSwallowing with a dry throat, [JAP.GetLeader] looked back up at the men suspiciously. He could permit at least some presence of German business and practically invite the enemy behind Japanese defenses, or throw them out and starve the Sphere of another opportunity for economic recovery."

No magnificent pillars of gold like the mythical kings of old, though Bormann did find the rugs rather pretty. There was a great chair, which Bormann figured to be some sort of throne, but it was empty - rather excellent, as Bormann would not stand for having to meet some Muslim in a great throne above him. He was lead to a side chamber, where he saw King Mohammed sitting at a table, waiting for him.\n\n"You're an enemy of Japan." Bormann was direct; drawing out the conversation didn't have much use to him.\n\n"That is correct," the King said. "And there are millions of Afghanis who are also enemies of Japan. Unfortunately, there are not millions of guns to match."\n\n"I get your point. The Reich has more guns than soldiers, and I am sure they will find their way in Afghani hands soon, if you are as great as an enemy of Japan as you say."\n\n"I am."\n\n"Then you have nothing to fear. The Reich will ensure Japan's enemies are strong."\n\nA smile came to Mohammed's face - perhaps this German was quite reasonable after all! "Now," Shah said, "we have economic questions to discuss."

I see your architects have taken some inspiration from our own!" he said with a grin.\n\n"Of course, Minister Hewel, we all want our capital to reach the heights of Germania one day," responded the monarch, seeming a bit nervous.\n\nNervous was good, Hewel thought. He could use that.\n\nOne hour had passed, and the meeting went on. Hewel's main goal was to reaffirm the Reich's commitments to Iran and its defense, but also to learn about rumors on the Shah's opposition, who seemed braver than ever lately. His ride from the airport to the palace had been insightful. Tehran was indeed more beautiful than ever, but one could see its decay and the unrest among its people. What the minister needed was to hear it straight from the lion's mouth.\n\n"So, while we can expect some aggression from the Iraqis-" the Shah was in the middle of his sentence when Hewel raised his hand in dismissal.\n\n"Your Majesty, forgive me for my bluntness, but you and I both know Iraq is no threat to your nation." Hewel adjusted himself in his seat as the Shah remained stunned and went on. "I'll be more direct. Our intelligence reports indicate your opposition is growing bolder every day that passes. What I need to report to Führer is: must the Reich turn its gaze to Iran?

The Yellow Race smells weakness like sharks smell blood in the water," The expression of the Indian diplomat changed, taking offense at the comment.

 bormann.1812.desc:0 "The origins of film's mastering has often lied in propaganda - take the Birth of a Nation in America, a very clearly racist film, yet responsible for many modern film techniques that really have modernized cinema. As such, while many of my countrymen are denouncing Zanjeer as a thinly veiled anti-Japanese propaganda pic, it is a genuinely innovative and enjoyable picture!\n\nMoving away from Bollywood's obsession with romance films, Zanjeer is a dark and gritty crime drama. The lead actor, Amitabh Bachchan, proves himself to be a versatile actor, but he really isn't the star of the show. The film has garnered controversy for its portrayal of its setting, that being Japanese occupied India. Corruption is utterly rampant, and most of the police are useless - Bachchan's colleagues in the police force, mostly Japanese, revel in cruelty and are hopelessly corrupt, making lavish purchases off the bribes they accrue over time.\n\nIt is worth noting that the film's propagandistic tendencies get much more noticeable as the film goes on. When the protagonist is arrested, the prisons are a horrifyingly gritty depiction of life under the Japanese, with barely any food for the prisoners, and an unbelievably brutal prison staff toes the line between a terrifying portrayal of the Japanese horrors and a laughable attempt at being brutal for brutality's sake. Of course, most people don't think of nuances like the portrayal of the Japanese when pointing to the propaganda of this film. After the film ends, credit rolling, in big white letters comes "A REAL PORTRAYAL OF LIFE IN JAPANESE-OCCUPIED INDIA. MAY WE RETURN TO THEM AND REJOICE IN PEACE."\n\nOverall, Zanjeer was an excellent film, and I look forward to seeing the future of this director and these actors - and, like much of India, I look forward to seeing us being reunited with our countrymen who are under the Japanese."

Accusing the Calcutta Government for 'radicalism' and 'treason' for committing itself in a military alliance with Tokyo, many in Delhi and across the subcontinent have been persuaded by the rhetoric that the Government of Free India must be confronted by means of words or war sooner rather than later. To little surprise, this has raised many eyebrows in Japan as many wonder if violent conflict is brewing on the horizon.\n\nHowever, and rather unsurprisingly, the Reich seems to be encouraging the Delhi Government, beating the drums of war to push Japanese influence out of Bengal. Whilst it is predictable that Japan's primary adversaries are backing a hostile regime, the diplomatic consequences of the heightened confrontations ring alarm bells behind closed doors. This has come in a series of heightened tensions between Germania and Tokyo as Führer Bormann presses for greater influences in the peripheries beyond immediate German military presence.\n\nThe Japanese keep watch over Bengal, awaiting further measures taken by Delhi in the coming weeks and months - anticipating the moment where they may have to draw the line in the sand."

Reclamation of rightful Reich territories in SACRE (South African Coastal Region East) met little resistance and were successful in taking territories lost during the Late and Post-Hitler instability period.\n\nENEMY POSITION: The enemy were not prepared for any kind of sustained assault, especially from a developed nation. There were no pillboxes, few trenches, and their weaponry was of notably low quality. It was a perfect depiction of the rebel groups put down by the Reich so many times.\n\nASSAULT REPORT: The Kriegsmarine began with a shelling of enemy positions, though there was not much to shell. Many enemy casualties occurred in this time, far more than usual, as Kriegsmarine soldiers noticed a great many enemies that showed signs of being killed through explosions.\n\nCASUALTY REPORT: The Kriegsmarine reports 25 dead and 156 wounded.\n\nCONCLUSION: This was a predictable success against a far inferior enemy. In fact, the Kriegsmarine was almost TOO careful - in future assaults on enemy positions like this, it would be safe to shell the enemy for a longer time, instead of rushing to an assault in fear of the assault coming too late - it's simply not possible for the enemy to prepare for an assault under the conditions they were in."

And, of course, in between all of those, this "fourth world", the neutral nations under the control of no global superpower, independent from the blocs locked in this cold war. Here, he would find his allies.\n\nIran was an obvious choice. Their government was already somewhat aligned with the Reich, and it would not be difficult to get them to partner with Germany against the Japanese empire. There are rumors of internal instability, but those rumors existed in almost every country on the globe. There was not much reason to pay them any mind.\n\nThe next country was another obvious one, India. Though the Indian government tended to lean far more left than the Reich would find appropriate, and there were rumors of their partnership with the Americans in some areas, the modern world was all about realpolitik, and it was impossible to pass down a partnership with a nation that big, and with such a good reason to hate Japan - they were occupying their territory, for god's sake!\n\nFinally, Afghanistan. It was less powerful and less developed than the other two; but that doesn't matter. What matters is that Afghanistan is the Graveyard of Empires, and there is a certain Empire that Bormann would like to dig a grave for. Thus, Afghanistan becomes the third piece of the anti-Japanese pact."

The rest of the attendees seemed to give as much mind to nuance as Bormann did. Liquor flowed like rivers, and though some of the attendees did not have much affection for the Indian booze, they did have affection for escaping from a boring meeting through the path of alcohol.\n\nThere were some very colorful characters.

It was in a strategic location, being a key island between German African holdings and the Indian Ocean, which had little superpower presence, and of the superpower presence there, it was mostly the Sphere.

It is not the Reich's place to become involved in how our organization runs, and it certainly is not something we will permit Germany to engage in without swift and certain reprisal.\n\nThough the jealousy of Germany at the strength and might of the Sphere is understandable, we must inform you that there will be no second warning on matters as serious as these.

The United States would speak first, setting the terms for what they deemed necessary for increased cooperation between themselves and the German Reich. The Germans would respond in kind, and as such the conference went well, at first, with the two sides making minor concessions and avoiding most discussion of the South African War.\n\nEventually, however, the United States delegation made a proposal that would require more consideration than the previous ones had: The Americans wanted the Germans to consent to give their President a direct line to the Führer, for quick action in times of crisis.

This is a simple measure to create trust between our nations, and allow quick resolution of any incidents that may arise. A method for our leaders to resolve such issues is critical for the expanding of relations."\n\nThe Führer felt less sure of the benefits of such a plan. It was certainly possible that it would lead to resolution of some disputes, but he also knew that it would lead to the Americans making demands of him on a much more frequent basis. It was one thing for the United States to object to the Reich's actions in the form of a speech across the sea. It was another to give them the power to make these criticisms directly to the Führer, at any time they saw fit. It would elevate the Americans almost to the level of equals.\n\nAs the German delegates argued amongst themselves as to the German response, Bormann allowed himself to think on the merits of the proposal.

While this may mean that they will be willing to broach the issue once relations have normalized, it could also mean that they are unwilling to fully commit to detente. Should we press them to give an answer?"

And yet somehow, Bormann has managed to turn the issue into a debate.\n\nDespite our insistence on the importance of the issue, the Germans have flatly declined any possibility of a hotline between our country's leaders. While the direct line is in no means  strictly necessary to achieve detente, the frank rejection of our first proposal, one that would be entirely mutually beneficial, grates upon us.

Our attempts to move the conference further have been blocked, and the American delegation insists that, for the relationship between the Reich and the United States to improve, this demand is strictly necessary. Refusal to meet it, they say, will be seen as refusal to cooperate with America.\n\nWhile many of our delegates believe that to turn back on our prior stance would be a sign of weakness, others argue that it is for the best of Germany to give in to the Americans just this once. It's beginning to look as if talks with the Americans will totally break down if the Führer does not permit this plan to move forward."

 bormann.1908.desc:0 "As he shook the hand of the President, Martin Bormann could not help but feel a significant amount of weight lift off of his already heavy shoulders. The Americans were willing to come to a deal, and the Reich would reap a great deal of benefits from it. Naturally, the Americans had not become friends overnight, but the Führer had no need for friends. He had a need for American missiles to be aimed at Tokyo rather than Germania, and that was what he had gotten. Any more than that was simply a blessing.\n\nThe Führer, a rare smile playing on his face, returned to the delegation, who were gathering their supplies to leave the conference center. "We have won a great victory for the Reich today." He informed them. "Be proud, of yourselves and of your country, for the fine work you have done today." They had not all been particularly helpful, of course, but he was in too fine a mood to complain.\n\nHe glanced around the room, and his eyes met that of the American president for a brief moment. He wondered what Hitler would have made of what had happened here today. Would he have denounced Bormann's actions, condemned the prospect of ever allying with a nation full of jews and capitalists? Would he have permitted the Reich he had forged in blood and iron to work together with a corrupt country built upon liberalism and democracy?\n\nBormann's thoughts were interrupted soon after, however. "My Führer."  It seemed Reichsminister Hewel wanted something of him. "It is thanks to your wit and bold view for the nation that this feat has been accomplished." Hewel glanced back at the diplomats. "In celebration, I suggest that we stay for a round of the finest Swedish vodka before returning to the Reich. My treat."\n\nThe Führer considered the man's proposal for some time. Ultimately, however, he shook his head. "Not today, Walther.""

 bormann.1909.desc:0 "The President of the United States gently gripped the Führer's hand and shook it, thinking of all the men who had died in South Africa. With this agreement, hopefully, such a thing would never happen again. The Organization of Free Nations was safe from any further attacks, at least from the east. If the Japanese in the west began to mobilize against them, meanwhile, the Emperor would be facing the might of two superpowers, not just one. The Free World may very well have been saved in this very room.\n\nJack Kennedy had been lauded across the nation for solving the Hawaiian Missile Crisis, true. But what would the American public think of the commander-in-chief who had stopped the Breton Missile Crisis before it had even happened? It certainly had been an eventful day, that was for sure.\n\nAs the American Delegation was escorted from the Conference Hall by the Secret Service, however, the President happened to lock eyes with Bormann, sitting amongst his fellow Nazis, who were babbling excitedly in German.\n\nThe weight of what the President had done finally hit. America had, for the first time ever, struck a deal with the krauts. A fascist power, brutal and cold in its repression of all dissent, and the world's beacon of freedom had shown itself willing to compromise with them. Suddenly, what had happened to the boys in South Africa was no longer a reassuring thought.\n\nNonetheless, the President shook themself of dread, placed their doubts aside and stepped through the conference hall doors. Immediately, a gaggle of reporters swarmed the group, flashing cameras and asking questions. A single reporter's voice was heard above the rest, asking the President what had occurred behind those closed doors. The President took a breath, and answered."

After all, if this was how they spoke to him now, at an official meeting of this importance, he could not imagine the ranting that would occur over the little red telephone they seemed so passionate about. It would be an ungodly mess\n\nFinally, the Führer had enough of all the talk about hotlines. He had given his answer, hadn't he? He gestured to get the translator's attention, and asked him to change the subject to that of tariffs. Hopefully, the Americans would get the message that he was unwilling to budge on the matter and drop it.\n\nWhat the Führer did not expect, however, was for the American President to begin shrieking words at him in a rather hostile tone. Bormann waited, and found no answer. Impatient, he glared at the American translator. "Well? What did he say?" The Führer demanded. "Answer me." The translator remained tight-lipped, shaking as the Führer stood. It was some mockery, then. Bormann would not permit mockery.\n\n"This whole conference has been a farce." Bormann declared, clearly filled with some amount of well-contained rage. "The United States is clearly unwilling to work with my government without my total capitulation on every matter! I asked for a detente, but clearly America is unwilling to achieve one. This meeting is over."\n\nThe Führer stormed out of the room, leaving behind a frantic translator attempting to simultaneously relay Bormann's message and Reichsminister Hewel's continued attempts to negotiate around the hotline. The conference did not continue long after that."

 bormann.1911.t:0 "Stockholm Conference Fails!"
 bormann.1911.desc:0 "The president meticulously explained, for what seemed like the hundredth time, why the two countries were in desperate need of a hotline between them. The Hawaii Missile Crisis was cited, as was the need to respond quickly if Japan was to make a move against either of them. If the two countries did not have the means to work together, the alliance would fall apart. The President was sure Bormann had finally been convinced. He almost seemed to be nodding slightly, as if in agreement. When he gave his response to the translator, the President did not hear a single 'nein' in there.\n\nInstead, what the translator said was, "The Führer would now like to discuss the status of the embargoes between our two nations."\n\nIn response to this, the President, consciously or not, expressed a few choice sentiments to the German Führer. The American translator, keen to avoid sparking a nuclear war, chose not to pass those sentiments onto Bormann. Nevertheless, he seemed to have gotten the gist of what the President had said.\n\nBefore anyone could say anything more, the German leader had made several bold declarations about the legitimacy of the conference and the American's intentions. All was silent in the room for a few minutes, both delegations too stunned to act.\n\nFinally, Hewel spoke, his voice somewhat weak. "Is it possible we could make the use of such a hotline conditional?" The conference did not continue long after that."

It was a bold plan, the idea of collaboration between the Reich and America, and many countries around the world wished to see it succeed or fail for their own reasons. Could the hegemon of Europe and the bastion of freedom see eye to eye?\n\nIn a turn of events shocking to many, the Stockholm Conference was a massive success for all parties. Though there were some initial disagreements, overall the event went swimmingly, with many deals and agreements being reached between the two parties. Now, these two powers will turn their attention off one another and onto another target: Most likely the Empire of Japan."

Could the hegemon of Europe and the bastion of freedom see eye to eye?\n\nIn an unsurprising turn of events, the negotiations fell through almost immediately. The American demand for a hotline to Germania was not only met with disagreement, but with active scorn, and that only set the tone for the entirety of the conference. In the end, the event ended with a loud personal disagreement between the leaders of the two superpowers. It seems an alliance, even a limited one, is not a possibility.\n"

 bormann.1914.t:0 "The English Issue"
 bormann.1914.desc:0 "The Führer watched the television in the corner of the office, quietly grinding his teeth. An American diplomat, one whose name Bormann could not bother to recall, seemed to be pushing for much closer ties with the English. He was brazen enough to publicly call for, or at least suggest, that the Brits would find a nice, comfortable home with their former empire in the Organization of Free Nations. Bormann scoffed. As if the OFN was an alliance of friendship and ideals, instead of a military pact just like any other.\n\nNevertheless, this had to be addressed. If the Americans and the Reich were to work together, Britain could not be allowed to serve as a floating missile silo just outside the Einheitspakt. The Führer was certain the Americans would understand this.\n\nNot wishing to miss a moment of the broadcast, Bormann kept his eyes on the screen as he grasped around for the phone. He felt his hand close around the receiver, and immediately pulled it up to his ear. "I need Hewel to get the fuck in here." The Führer commanded, watching the American delegate and the Prime Minister speak."

 bormann.1915.t:0 "The Japanese Concern"
 bormann.1915.desc:0 ""The Reich would be willing to offer their friends in the United States information on military installments in the Provisional Government of Free India." Franz announced, withdrawing a folder containing that very same information. The HVA had given him a very detailed list of what information he would be permitted to offer the Americans, and when he would be allowed to do so. After all, the Reich greatly feared being the party in this exchange left more in the dark.\n\nHank raised an eyebrow. "The United States of America would like to offer in turn recent reports on the state of the Imperial Japanese Navy." He slid his own folder onto the table, carrying the American intelligence. Wordlessly, the two agents swapped the information, each giving the papers a cursory glance before stowing them away.\n\nThis continued for another ten or so minutes, each of the men offering information about the Japanese and the other giving a separate list of details about the Sphere to swap it with. The first few days of these negotiations had been more tense, with more bartering and discourse, but Franz and Hank had quickly realized the actual amount of information being exchanged between their countries would never be changed. As such, they had devised a faster method to do it.\n\nAfter the day's quota of top secret documents had been shared, the two exchanged glances in the silent room. Franz spoke first. "I think that the Brazilians will take the cup again. Their team is simply too good." For the rest of the time that had been set aside for their meeting, the two intelligence agents bickered about their favorite teams."

 bormann.1916.desc:0 "It seemed that English membership in the Organization of Free Nations was not meant to be.\n\nThe Yanks had several qualifications to this deal, which the Reich was able to meet. If England was unable to join the OFN, then it would similarly be denied entry into the Einheitspakt. Naturally, this also meant that the Reich invading the small island and forcing them into the German sphere of influence was also off the table. It seemed that England would be forever doomed as a neutral at a time in which neutrality was less and less sustainable.\n\nWhile of course not ideal, these were things easily agreed to. The safety of the Reich came first, and England was not a prize worth jeopardizing that. The deal was also an early sign of how beneficial Stockholm had been. The Americans and the German Reich would continue their close, friendly collaboration, and the little wrinkle that was England was easily smoothed out.\n\nThis victory serves as a reminder to the doubtful of how truly beneficial Stockholm was to the Reich. After all, had we not found common cause with the Yankees, it's very possible that there could now be missiles aimed at the heart of Germania. Heil Bormann, who has brought us this great victory on the diplomatic stage!"

Naturally, this also meant that the Germans invading the small island and forcing them into the German sphere of influence was also off the table. It seemed that England would be forever doomed as a neutral at a time in which neutrality was less and less sustainable.\n\nThis was not an agreement of immense popularity amongst our friends in the OFN. Canada especially was less than pleased at England's exclusion from the organization. However, this displeasure was easily countered with the prospect of a second sealion. That was what this deal had saved the English from. In addition to that argument against the Canadians, however, was the truth that every man in power knew in their heart of hearts: The Reich was an infinitely more valuable ally than the Brits could ever be.\n\nWe had pitched this tent at Stockholm, and it is not something that we can back out of if we desire absolute and total victory over Japan. For better or for worse, we have chosen our friendships and cannot allow them to spoil. We can only hope the English will understand."

Hewel had figured that their exclusion would lead to a weaker response from the Japanese, and that would be better.\n\n"The Empire of Japan." Hewel began, taking a moment for the crowd to calm before continuing. "Has long occupied portions of the United States, and the fifty states that make up its entirety." Hewel made certain to emphasize the word fifty. "The Führer has asked me to make clear the position of himself, and the Reich, on this illegal garrisoning of foreign lands."\n\n"The German Reich, on the matter of Hawaii and the treaty ports, recognizes these lands as legally, fully, and fundamentally American." Hewel continued, unperturbed by the murmuring and shouting of questions that erupted soon after. "As such, the Führer firmly urges the Empire of Japan to withdraw their troops from the United States, and begin the process of transferring these lands to their rightful American administration."\n\nAs the reporters surged forward to ask questions, Hewel answered them as best he could, though he refused to give much more information. His mind was elsewhere, as he focused on the looks of excitement clear on the faces of the American press. He could only hope that gratitude was shared by the American public."

The drunken bureaucrats of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs downed their glasses and mopped up the last scraps of food as the waiter arrived with a new bottle of champagne.\n\n"Swedish vodka, now champagne... I think Hewel's becoming a drunkard." Von Schirach was smiling wryly, sipping gently on his glass of sparkling wine. If he was angered by his lack of involvement in the Stockholm Conference, he didn't show it.\n\n"As long as he's sober for our trip to Washington," Bormann smirked. "I'm still awaiting a response from the Americans. Why are they taking so long? The Führer of the Großgermanisches Reich on American soil is perfect propaganda for both our nations."\n\n"Perhaps I could accompany you?" Von Schirach was staring distractedly at Hans Krupp, who had risen to his feet to propose yet another toast.\n\n"We've been through this, Baldur. Stay put.

Martin Bormann and his Foreign Minister, Walther Hewel, will then travel to America for further bilateral negotiations and the opportunity to shake hands with the President before the cameras.

He was as slippery as an eel, as effeminate as a degenerate and more pretentious than a fucking priest... but amusing nonetheless. They burst into laughter as Bormann's secretary, Gerhard Klopfer, slunk into the room.\n\n"My Führer," Gerhard Klopfer nodded to Bormann. He turned to Von Schirach. "Parteikanzler. The Americans have responded to our request. They wish to maintain the detente, but declined your offer of meeting the President in Washington DC."\n\nThe smile faded from Bormann's face in an instant as he curled his fist, snapping the fresh cigar in half. He ground his teeth together before releasing a deep breath.\n\n"So be it," he muttered through gritted teeth. "The mongrel dogs still want open relations with us. They just don't want the Führer on their degenerate land. So be it." He leapt to his feet and paced around the table. "You know why, gentlemen? Fear. The American mongrel fears us.

Yet it didn't stop Bormann from imagining the ugly monstrosity below him being bombed into one fiery necropolis.\n\n"I'll have to buy a souvenir for Blanda," Hewel said suddenly. He was sitting on the opposite side of the table, glass in hand, staring out of the plane window. "Maybe something Disney, like a Mickey Mouse watch. What about a gift for Baldur? I know how much he wanted to be on this trip."\n\n"I didn't realize we were on holiday..." Bormann replied with a look of mock confusion. Hewel went silent. Bormann cast his eyes back to the skyline. "We're making history, Walther. History! Future generations will learn of our diplomatic genius! Stop acting like a fucking child."\n\nPerhaps he should have brought Baldur von Schirach after all? He was as slippery as an eel, as effeminate as a degenerate and more pretentious than a fucking priest... but, unlike the dull bureaucrat before him, von Schirach had a sharp wit Bormann couldn't help but respect.\n\nBormann poured himself a glass of schnapps.

"You won't believe what just happened, Francis. The German Foreign Ministry contacted us. I'm not talking about some bureaucrat or civil servant, I'm not just talking about any old schmuck. Herr Hewel himself! He wants you to travel to Germany to meet with Martin Bormann."\n\n"Martin Bormann?" Francis replied, mouth agape. He quickly grabbed another cigarette. "What kind of meeting are we talking about here, Revilo? Private or public?"\n\n"He didn't say."\n\nFrancis Parker Yockey stared into space, brow furrowed in deep thought. The Führer himself wanted to meet? If Hitler was the progenitor of European National Socialism, then Martin Bormann was its most loyal guardian. Did Bormann truly recognize Yockey as another stalwart defender of the White race?\n\nYet the pride swelling swelling in his chest was tainted by something else. Unease. As much as he respected Bormann, he knew it would be political suicide to travel to Germania and shake hands with the Führer. After all, Yockey was a patriot. He wanted his surname to be synonymous with 'America'. Travelling to a foreign country to kiss the ass of its leader would destroy the National Vanguard in a single day."

Now, The Führer had gathered his ministers to discuss the ramifications of such a thing, and what their next move would be on the subject.\n\nThe Führer began to issue orders immediately, leaving little time for the men to respond. "Lange, I trust you have received the new budget." Kurt nodded, tapping a folder that he brought with him. Bormann continued. "We need to ramp up military production, if we are to be prepared for attacks by the Americans and the Japanese. It is clear that the Americans are unwilling to combat the Empire of the Asiatics, so we can only presume the two are working together to undermine us."\n\nNext, The Führer turned to Müller, sitting to his right. "Ensure that said undermining does not take hold. In addition to this, many senior officials of the NSDAP were rather publicly in favor of the Stockholm conference. Make certain they hold no American sympathies we were unaware of." The head of the Ordnungspolizei nodded. It would be easy to find a scapegoat for the conference's failure.\n\nFinally, Bormann spoke to his deputy. "Von Schirach, I want you to inform the OKW that their current level of drilling is unacceptable. The Army, the Kreigsmarine, the Luftwaffe... all must be leagues above their contemporaries. The Reich cannot be permitted to fall behind, or the Aryan race will be beset on all sides by its foemen."\n\nAs  The Führer dismissed his ministers, all four men noticed that no new instructions had been issued to Hewel.

This entire expedition was an attempt to mock the Führer, to provide amusing footage for the American Minderwertige to guffaw over. Unbeknownst to the State Department, Bormann knew how to fight fire with fire. The American audiences would receive their propaganda... while the German people would suffer an insight into America's degeneracy. He had entered the lion's den, not to let the beast consume him, but to stand before it as a superior being.\n\n"Would you like fries with that?" asked Goofy. Bormann's translator whispered into his ear.\n\n"I just want the burger," Bormann snapped. The translator relayed the reply, and the large anthropomorphic dog handed over a small greasy meal. Bormann snatched it and wolfed it down. He threw the wrapper into a nearby trashcan and turned to the cameras. "Gentlemen, you can start filming now." The translator shouted the order in English.\n\nBormann crossed his arms and stared defiantly at the indulgent display of capitalism that surrounded him.

The incompetent Jew in the White House, it seemed, was a true member of his despicable race. He considered for a moment that he could blame the whole idea on Hewel, but decided against it. Even the most silver of tongues could not convince a weed to befriend the weedkiller. If Bormann were to truly free Germany from Jewish influence, it had been a foolish idea to collaborate with a nation so ripe with hatred for Aryans and Western civilization.\n\nAt the very least, Bormann considered it a propaganda win. He could show his fellow nations that he had tried to be the reasonable one, to reach out with a hand of friendship: something the United States had slapped away. Surely, one could not now think of the Germans as the aggressor in this Cold War. Besides, it would give the German people strength to know how infested with liberalism the United States was. How deeply into their culture hatred for the German people was rooted.

Michael Goldwater had been a strange man indeed.\n\nPresident Goldwater thumbed, for the third time or so, through the papers that the German delegation had forwarded to him. 'The German Reich, in light of the threat of the Japanese Menace, wishes to establish a firm and mutual detente with the United States of America. This would be to the benefit of both of our strong nations, and would serve to bring about a new German and American golden age.' Goldwater stopped reading there. He had the rest of the letter memorized already.\n\nGrandpa Mike had always been quiet about why he had left Russia. Barry had asked him, time and time again. The answer had often changed, frankly, but Barry remembered one of his answers most of all. "Well, Barry." His Grandfather began, leaning over to talk to the boy. "There were men in Russia, bad men, who did not want other men to be treated as their fellows, and instead as property. Some very good men tried to change that, and when they failed, I had to leave."\n\nPresident Goldwater wiped away the tears beginning to well in his eyes. It was not so unlikely that his Grandfather would have stayed, and that poor young Barry would have perished in Hitler's camps among so many others. President Goldwater began to write, furiously jotting down his response to the audacity, the utter hypocrisy of Bormann to offer peace when he had brought nothing but war and to offer friendship while he butchered families by the dozen."
