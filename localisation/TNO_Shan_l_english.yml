 POLITICS_SAO_NANG_HEARN_KHAM_DESC:0 "Hearn Kham grew up a privileged life, more privileged than practically anyone in Burma. Her father was the lord of the Shan state of North Hsenwi, and her brother inherited that title. Meanwhile, her husband was the lord of the Shan state of Yawnghwe - that is, before her husband was arrested on charges of separatism and the Federated Shan States were abolished. Now, he is the king of nothing, and she is the queen of the ground that she stands on.\n\nAs the 1950s rolled on, her people faced further oppression as the Burmese identity was forced onto the Shan people. At risk of death, she fled to Thailand with her family, vowing to free her people when she returned. With her son, Chao-Tzang Yawnghwe, she has merged the various Shan rebellion groups into one – she chairs the Shan State War Council, and commands the Shan State Army. Together, the Shan people march against the Bamar oppressors, for the sake of freedom."
