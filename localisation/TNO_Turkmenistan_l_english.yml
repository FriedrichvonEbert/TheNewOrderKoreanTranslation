 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_PODA_ANNAORAZOV_DESC:0 "Nothing in the past of Poda Annaorazov foreshadowed his magnificent future. A former medical orderly of the Red Army, Annaorazov initially began merely as an insignificant agronomist of the Turkmen SSR during her later days. But as the Communist Turkmenia was destined to fall to the internal dissent, Annaorazov found his place among the ranks of the newly-founded Republican Party of Turkmenistan, eventually rising as its sole leader and the strongman of the whole Turkmenistan, all due to his political wit and extraordinary vision for the future of the country.\n\nA committed anti-Communist, Annaorazov was nevertheless utterly delighted by the Bolshevik efforts to promote a Turkmen nationhood, even if those were driven by their ulterior, imperialist motives, and was never ashamed to take the Soviet lessons to the heart. Although Turkmenistan is a united state, Turkmens are not a united nation, but rather a congestion of different tribes and ethnicities that talk in different languages, that live in different ways of life, the different peoples that have no concept of themselves as a people of the same kinship. The Soviets tried to change it, but failed, but not because of the intention, right in its essence, but because of their own incompetence. Only a strong leader, a man of ambitions greater than himself, consistently resolute in his goals, could accomplish such an incredible feat.\n\nEven in the absence of jailers from Moscow, Turkmenistan stands as a weak and inferior state to its neighbors, and the lack of national consciousness and national unity is what undermines her strength. To survive the challenge of history, Turkmens should become a modern nation and who else, if not the head of the Turkmen, the one rests his power on the most progressive parts of the country, is capable to head their arduous path to greatness?"

 TRK_white_sun_of_the_desert_desc:0 "We are the Turkmen! For millennia our ancestors have led their tribes through the Central Asian steppe. They resisted domination by mighty empires such as the Persians, the Mongols and the Russians. Now the death of the Soviet Union has freed us once more from our bondages.\n\nIf we are to remain free, our nation must become strong. The division and infighting between rival tribal confederations has always been a tool used by foreigners to control us. If an independent Turkmenistan is to survive we must forge all Turkmen into one people, strong and united.\n\nIn our capital our leader Poda Annaorazov starts with very little. Over the years he has accumulated good will from many tribal leaders by acting as mediator and by organizing a token defense of the frontier. Now begins a process of reform and unification. There are many barriers to a centralized, unified Turkmen state. But for the good of all Turkmen, we must begin chipping away at them!"
 TRK_unite_the_tribes:0 "Unite The Tribes"
 TRK_unite_the_tribes_desc:0 "What is Turkmenistan, exactly? For most of history, the Turkmen have been one nomadic people and Turkmenistan the vague geographic range where their tribes lived. Even today, the Turkmen people do not feel much kinship to one another beyond the members of their tribe. The nation of Turkmenistan is a fairly new concept, born from the ashes of the Soviet Union. For now, it is merely a geographic expression; our neighbors are never thrilled to see our people wander into their land uninvited.\n\nIf we are to unite Turkmenistan as a modern nation, we must unite the tribes and forge them into a new identity. The Turkmen must come to see their country as one great tribe, within which their friends and family live in harmony."
 TRK_fight_as_one:0 "Fight As One"
 TRK_fight_as_one_desc:0 "If the Turkmen are to form one great tribe, they must fight as one to defend it.\n\nA modern military is needed to hold our borders and prevent any foreign aggression. While our nation modernizes, the development of its army must never lag far behind. Already representatives of every tribe have been gathered to create a new high command of the Turkmen army. Our experience deterring border raids will prove crucial in building the national army. Men of the entire nation must be integrated to it, and modern arms must be forged to equip them. The road to modernization will be a long one, but as long as we keep our pace up we'll get there in the end."
 TRK_reform_the_militias:0 "Reform The Militias"
 TRK_reform_the_militias_desc:0 "Every adult Turkmen is willing to fight for his tribe. This state of affairs follows naturally from the harsh life on the steppe, where conflicts for resources are sometimes necessary. Our men folk have historically been known to be superb warriors for other nations. Why not tap into this potential for ourselves?\n\nInstead of keeping the militias as ad-hoc fighting forces that men are free to join or leave as they see fit, the high command has suggested transforming them into the nuclei of our professional army. By keeping at least a fifth of the militiamen as permanent troops paid by the central government, and encouraging a regular rotation of all adult men into the militia units, we can increase both our pool of professional soldiers and of well trained reservists."
 TRK_joint_training_exercises:0 "Joint Training Exercises"
 TRK_joint_training_exercises_desc:0 "The old order saw militias as a tribal affair, a method to guarantee the safety of one's tribe and relatives. The only times where two militias or more interacted was during inter-tribal conflicts, or when large quantities of Turkmen were drafted into foreign armies.\n\nAs such, it might feel insane for militias to actually train together and potentially reveal critical information about the strength of each tribe. But the militias must get used to joint training exercises. Riding and firing with other warriors of Turkmenistan will improve the ability of each militia to function in our defensive policy. It will also help chip away at the mental wall between each tribe, and help the men to start thinking of their fellow soldiers not as foreigners, but as fellow defenders of the Turkmen steppes.\n\nTo get things started off, a friendly horse racing competition in the capital has been organized. Why not make military training fun?"
 TRK_war_games:0 "War Games"
 TRK_war_games_desc:0 "The reaction to the first series of joint training exercises has not been too far from cautious enthusiasm, and so the high command has proposed organizing more complex war games. A group of militias representing an enemy OpFor will simulate an attack on the border, with several raiding parties trying to break through. The defenders will have to simultaneously defend the border in mock engagements, and send light cavalry to pursue and harass the raiders.\n\nWar games are important at every level of a modern army's training. They give officers and commanders the feeling of commanding vast group of men in stressful situations. The common soldier is provided with a chance to train out in the field in conditions resembling his future deployments. They give our men experience with attacking and defending.\n\nTo sweeten the deal, some food has been prepared for every militiamen that joins the exercise outside of the regular army. Having a big cook-off on the plains is always a fun occasion, and the war department's budget for special events has to go somewhere."
 TRK_shore_up_defenses:0 "Shore Up Defenses"
 TRK_shore_up_defenses_desc:0 "Our first war games were great fun! More importantly, they've given us a treasure trove of information about weak points of our border. It is not simple to guard vast stretches of open land with a small army that is still undergoing modernization. It was quite easy for the attack team in the war games to penetrate deep into our land, reach their objectives and then retreat across the border.\n\nA mixture of old ideas and modern strategies can help our border be more secure. Areas close to major settlements or roads can be defended with forts, trenches and barbed wire. Less important parts of the border can be patrolled by light cavalry. And all across the frontiers, well supplied fortresses can hold out for great length of time against enemies lacking heavy artillery or aerial forces. Any invader trying to bypass the forts will find their supply lines exposed as they try to reach the interior.\n\nThese reforms will take some time to implement, but will have the added benefit of helping train our military engineer corps, and give work to tribes living near the border."
 TRK_a_centralized_military:0 "A Centralized Military"
 TRK_a_centralized_military_desc:0 "Well trained and reformed militias are a good stop-gap measure, but the end game really is a centralized army under the control of our government. By recruiting every volunteer we can find into the centralized army, and then slowly adding draftees to it, we can begin dissolving the tribal affiliations. At first it will take some time, but as the central army grows and its esprit de corps strengthens, bigger and bigger batches of draftees can be melted into the new army. As the conscripts end their term of service, they will go back to their tribe and feel a stronger connection to our government and its people.\n\nThe central army will also begin to shift the balance of power between us and our tribal 'partners'. Right now unruly tribes can only be brought into line using the militias of other tribes. Having an army of our own will let us police nogoodniks and traitors without growing our pile of debt to the tribal chiefs."
 TRK_an_integrated_officer_corps:0 "An Integrated Officer Corps"
 TRK_an_integrated_officer_corps_desc:0 "One thing we can certainly do to speed up integration of tribal warriors into the army is to recruit veteran militia officers and tribal chiefs as officers for our army. These men with decades of experience will be invaluable to our efforts; some even served in the last days of the old Soviet Union.\n\nOf course, actually recruiting these venerable men will take some work. Many are reluctant to leave their tribe behind without leadership or protections. Others have left behind the military life and simply want to live the rest of their days peacefully. Finally, some just hate the idea of a centralized government and would rather spit on us than help us in any way.\n\nA healthy dose of carrot and stick will help us lure these veterans away from their home and into our new army. This initial generation will not have to serve forever; we only need their help to get the ball rolling. Those that are completely unwilling to help us can at least point us to local talent that will help tie their tribe to our army."
 TRK_standardized_weapon_production:0 "Standardized Weapon Production"
 TRK_standardized_weapon_production_desc:0 "In the olden days, every man carried his own weapons. A father would equip his sons as they came of age with whatever combination of ancestral equipment and modern acquisition the family could afford. In time of need the tribe might buy new gear from foreign merchants, or from city folks. As a result, each modern Turkmen tribe has a veritable museum of weaponry. Old swords, compound bows for hunting, old matchlock weapons from the tsarist days, rifles from the two world wars, and the odd modern design from the Russian wastes or from the Sphere.\n\nExcept for military historians, few in our modern nation find these weird assortments of weapon of practical interests. Standardizing our weaponry is one of the first priorities of our nascent military industry. By issuing everyone with a handful of Soviet or WRRF pattern designs, we can simplify our supply line and make sure our men are better equipped. An increase in the presence of sub-machine guns and light machine guns will help our troops repel cavalry raids with ease."
 TRK_manning_the_factories:0 "Manning The Factories"
 TRK_manning_the_factories_desc:0 "Our burgeoning military industry needs people to man it, just as our burgeoning army needs soldiers to hold its guns. Factory work is dirty, tiring and grimy work, but someone has to do it.\n\nOf course, luring men and women away from their nomadic life into settled factory towns will be quite the undertaking. Part of the solution has been a proposed national worker's conscription, parallel to our military one. Every tribe and settlement will have to furnish a quota of men and women to work in our factories. In return money and subsidies will be given to the various partners. In the longer run, as our factories grow the lure of permanent jobs will attract many poverty stricken nomads to settle permanently. Their children will be able to attend school and learn technical skills indispensable to our modern economy. This population settling will help us slowly break the patterns of independent nomadic tribes that weaken our central government."
 TRK_a_modern_military:0 "A Modern Military"
 TRK_a_modern_military_desc:0 "Modern steel protects our men. Their officers deploy them in an orderly fashion. Their lodgings are proper, well supplied barracks in fortified positions. Veteran militiamen help the rookies learn their trade, in between war games and outdoor exercises. And in our capital, our most elite battalions parade in front of the Presidential Palace for important holidays.\n\nLittle by little; service in the national army has ceased to be a chore. Instead, young men see it as a natural evolution of the old tribal militias they served in. Tribes move at a brisker pace now that they feel like the roads are well patrolled by dedicated troops.\n\nYes, Turkmenistan now has a modern military. It is time to put the finishing touches to our national defense force. No longer hostages to the whims of our tribal leaders, the Turkmen nation is free to flourish without any fear of foreigners encroaching on our land. In time even the most stubborn tribal chiefs will learn to see where the wind is blowing."
 TRK_strengthen_control:0 "Strengthen Control"
 TRK_strengthen_control_desc:0 "The National Republican Party of Turkmenistan started out as a loose coalition of former Soviet Bureaucrats, Turkmen nationalists and local militias. Just as we plan to turn the nomads and loosely organized tribes of Turkmenistan into one nation, indivisible, so must the party at its center be made into one united whole led by our President Annaorazov.\n\nThere is much to learn from the failure of the Bukharin led Soviet Union. It is difficult to lead a one party nation without making sure the nation's sole political organism is strong. Multiple power concentrations within the party can lead to lack of focus. If the issue is not managed when it comes to finding a successor to the current leader, violent succession crisis can be triggered.\n\nThe faction backing our current President has thus begun pruning the party of deadweight, bribing some and arresting others on trumped charges. It can be made very lucrative to support Annaorazov, just as it can be made very costly to oppose him. With diligent work, our control of the party, and thus of Turkmenistan, can be made complete."
 TRK_investigate_dissent:0 "Investigate Dissent"
 TRK_investigate_dissent_desc:0 "To quote Isaac Newton, " To every action an equal and opposite reaction." Our work centralizing power around the President's group has elicited pushback from various officials and power broker in the capital and beyond. Rumors of dissent have reached the ears of President Annaorazov.\n\nProceeding from here will require caution. Panicking and arresting everyone in reaction to the rumors will make us look weak, while letting any dissent slide will invite our opponents to be even more brazen in their plots.\n\nOur first move will thus be an information gathering effort. By corroborating rumors and evidence from various sources, we can have a clearer idea of the opposition. From there, a sweep of arrests and "accidents" for the main figures of opposition will dissuade others from joining in. Better to be a bit too generous with the arrest and beatings to avoid letting guilty parties escape our justice."

But our efforts have so far been based more on spur of the moment decisions than any long term strategy. It is time to remedy to this.\n\nOur new Ministry for National Security will combine foreign intelligence with domestic duties such as internal security. While at first expected to serve its main role in the capital of the nation to silence opponents to our reform of the party. In time as our centralization effort advance, the reach our ministry will extend to cover every corner of the nation.\n\nOf course, to prevent our spooks from turning on us, the ministry's affair will have to be monitored by our men. Intertwining the higher ups of the ministry with the men closest to our President will be a priority, as will be maintaining some level of distance between the army and our new spies. But managed well, this new intelligence agency will bring many dividends."

These new media will bring a wealth of benefits to the country, yet they also risk bringing in many perils. Foreign propaganda, seditious drivel from the opposition, autonomist nonsense from the tribal chiefs. . . The list of dangers to our government goes on and on.\n\nBy making sure every newspaper and radio company complies to rules set out by the government, we can make sure the media consumed by our citizens nourishes their minds instead of poisoning it. Other ideas involve outright forcing new media company to sell shares to the government, and launching a new ministry of Culture and Information to ascertain that all media that crosses our border is safe for our citizens.\n\nPerhaps one day, each family will have the chance to possess a TV to listen to the speeches of our glorious President."

Yet who was it that worked tirelessly for the cause of national unification, for the strengthening of the National Republican Party? President Annaorazov has, and remains the greatest hero of the republican effort.\n\nClan leaders claim to fear the erosion of their tribal identity and absorption into an imaginary super tribe with Annaorazov as chief. Yet who has been the greatest defender of traditional Turkmen culture, the man to do most to celebrate and cherish the life of the nation's ancestors? Annaorazov has been nothing if not devoted in his quest to bring forward the ancient Turkmen people as a proud nation.\n\nWe must have faith in Annaorazov, the father of all Turkmen people. His guidance has seen the Turkmen become stronger they have been in centuries. We must trust him and follow his lead into this brave new world!"

A common refrain of those that would strip us of our agency is that we are a motley assortment of tribes, and not a nation onto ourselves. Such nonsense shall no longer be tolerated! By researching and teaching the history of the Turkmen people, we can achieve several overlapping goals: foreigners trying to subjugate our lands will have a harder time justifying their wars of conquest; the legitimacy of our central government will be strengthened as we are the righteous leaders of the Turkmen people; and finally, our citizens will learn to recognize that their tribal allegiances are secondary when compared to being a proud Turkmen citizen."

Our government has of course recognized the Imam and Islamic scholars as national treasures, and promised them protection. By increasing our link to these esteemed men of god, we can increase the prestige of our government.

 TRK_a_common_tongue:0 "A Common Tongue"

Of course, the Turkmen people are one, and they all speak the same mutually intelligible language. Of course, we could do better than this.\n\nWe can reuse the old Soviet Union language standardization program to impose one variant of standard Turkmen language across our nation. Schools will teach this dialect, and our radio programs will help spread it further. Having one common language will do much to erase the barrier in the mind between the different tribes.\n\nThis program, however, is likely to run into substantial backlash. The Soviet bureaucrats chose one of the dialects associated with the greatest tribe, the Teke. As such, reusing the Soviet Union's plan for a standardized Turkmen language is sure to result in a few awkward questions. Still, we shall press on. One language for one nation."

Rich or poor, and no matter what tribe they come from, our youth will be given the same education. By the end of their stay in school we expect the new generation to have all the tools needed to perform as Turkmen citizens.\n\nDesigning this shared curriculum will take some time. All sorts of pressure groups have asked to be included in the decision making process, from people of our Republican Party, to army chiefs, to our new industrial magnates. Imams have in particular requested to be part of the new teaching system. It will take some time to separate bad ideas from the good ones, but not too long hopefully.

When the Russian Empire annexed our ancestor's land, they saw few reasons to revisit the arrangement. What did they care about the life of a few squabbling tribes on the periphery of the empire, as long as internal peace was maintained? The Soviet Union mostly maintained the same administrative regions, before its collapse to the Germans.\n\nNow our country is subdivided internally according to where our ancestors used to let their herds graze during the winter. This will not do for a modern nation; this will not do at all. New internal divisions must be built to help the administration of a modern nation. It is of little concern what mix of tribe lives within what region. What matters is that every Turkmen citizen is given the same amount of help by the government. Once this is accomplished, former differences will slowly fade away."

While their ideals proved worthless in the long run, their approach was not totally awful. When one sees a proud figure hewed from the earth's toughest materials, the effect is always impressive. The only question is, to whom should these monuments be built? Why, the glory of the Turkmen people, of course!\n\nGreat chiefs, proud warriors, important forefathers of our people. It matters not what tribe they belonged to; they are all important in the collective history of Turkmenistan. And so they should be commemorated. Beyond statues and monuments, great banners can be thrown up. Walls can be covered with murals in the capital. The methods to express our achievements as a nation are only limited by our creativity. And these public demonstrations of pride in our ancestors will make our fellow citizens all the happier to help build Turkmenistan's future."

Thus, as the saying goes, if we want to learn more about our past we'll have to do it ourselves! The national historical society has marked several locations as potential dig sites. There are many historical periods we could learn more about. Relatively little is known about the earliest human settlements in Turkmenistan, such as the possible presence of Neanderthals in the region. Other scholars are interested in learning more about the Hellenistic period, and the subsequent Parthian and Sassanid presence in the area. Some are more interested in the Middle Ages, where Mongol and Timurid lords travelled through the Turkmen desert.\n\nInvestigating these things will take some time, but already we see renewed interest by locals in Turkmen history.

If our military exercises brought together people from all corners of Turkmenistan to share military ideas, the great clan gathering will be an occasion to share all sorts of news, cultural events and celebrations.

The happy couples will be given a special wedding gift to help them start their life together. This will both be an encouragement to others considering tying the knot with someone from outside their tribe, and a much needed subsidy to help find lodging outside of one's tribe or in one of our new industrial centers.\n\nSeeing closer ties between every set of tribe will be priceless for our government. In the long run, it might even help make tribal affiliation slowly fade away, as our citizens begin to think of themselves as Turkmen first."

 TRK_we_are_all_turkmen_desc:0 "The fall of the Soviet Union brought hard times to the Turkmen people, and many could only find salvation in their tribe and family. No more! Even as our government has worked hard to restore economical prosperity to our lands, the ties between once rival tribes have slowly been healed. Each day that passes sees more and more Turkmen realize the importance of their homeland and its republic.\n\nA lot remains to be done. Many tribes still compete for resources and important roles in the new nation. Some groups have not yet been uplifted from their poverty, their future not yet secured by the Turkmen nation.\n\nBut a government's work is never completely done. It's not a bad thing to take a moment and pride ourselves on how far we've come in creating a feeling of belonging. Today, we are all Turkmen."

Why not combine both into one great parade in our capital Ashgabat to celebrate the glory of the Republic?\n\nA great cavalry host can gallop down the streets in front of the presidential palace, followed by our border troops, with elite infantry divisions closing the march. The great parade will be a public holiday, and food and drink will be offered to our citizens to encourage them to partake in celebrations of the national army.\n\nWith these men as sword and shield of Turkmenistan, our great leader Annaorazov shall defend the nation from all threats!"

 TRK_cultural_festivals_desc:0 "Some might once have mocked the idea of cultural festivals in Turkmenistan. What stories could a bunch of tribes wandering the dry steppe tell the world?\n\nThe doubters are being proven wrong by our new cultural festivals. Members of all tribes share tales and stories. The young and the less young attend public conferences given by our new archeology and history departments. Contests see women from various clans come up with new textile patterns, reflecting their clan's traditions in imaginative new ways. Scholars from beyond our borders are invited to share in the ways other Turkic nations are similar and dissimilar.\n\nIt is a fun day to be Turkmen, and even in as our nation emerges from troubled times, we can take time to celebrate our common past and future."

 TRK_birth_of_a_nation_desc:0 "The Turkmen's independence was shattered in the time of the Great Game, when the Russian Empire annexed the land where our forefathers had grazed their herds. When the death of the Soviet Union freed us from our bondage, there was a considerable debate both within our nation and outside it as to the Turkmen's right to independent existence. The Central Asian nations, the thinking went, were too small and fragmented for a life outside the greater powers of the region. How long until a resurgent Russia took back control of the land? Or how long until the small statelets become simple Iranian satellites in the region?\n\nWe have finally proven the doubters wrong. Turkmenistan as a modern, independent nation is finally being taken seriously as a concept by geopolitical wonks and leaders around the world. This may not stop the predation of bigger neighbors forever, but our constant struggle to improve and develop our country will see Turkmenistan grow in strength. We are now free to make our own destiny under the white sun of central Asia!"
 TRK_the_persian_connection:0 "The Persian Connection"
 TRK_the_persian_connection_desc:0 "Throughout all of our history, the Turkmen have had numerous interactions with the Persians to the south. Sometimes as partners, sometimes as enemies. Now history is set to repeat as we need to decide how to approach the Imperial State of Iran to our south. With the anarchy that reigns to the north, in Kazakhstan and Russia, Iran is likely to be our greatest point of access to the outer world. And in the unlikely eventuality of a reunification of the Russian lands, Iran is likely to be a supremely important counterweight against Russian interests in our region.\n\nBetter diplomatic ties with Iran is thus the name of the game. We should assemble a first delegation to our southern neighbor to try and get in their good graces. We do not know the Shah and his advisors' objectives for Central Asia at the moment, but a working government in Turkmenistan must surely be one of them. After all, who enjoys a long ill defined border with a dysfunctional state?"
