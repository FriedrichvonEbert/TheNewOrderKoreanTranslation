 goering.1.t:0 "갑작스러운 군사 쿠데타!"
 goering.1.d:0 "In a surprising, or perhaps unsurprising, and disastrous turn of events, it seems as though the military have turned against us! The military have not taken kindly to the rule of Hermann Göring due to the state of anarchy that German is currently in and have decided to exercise their power by couping the current government.\n\nGöring has been seen by many, not only within the military, as a largely ineffective leader who has been unable to manage the ever changing German political scene and assert dominance over the already teetering Reich.\n\nInternational observers watch on, stunned by the chaotic events that have engulfed the Reich, and the hold their breath, not knowing what is yet to come..."
 goering.1.a:0 "The coup is largely bloodless"
 goering.1.b:0 "We shall not surrender power!"

 goering.2.t:0 "Göring is Victorious"
 goering.2.desc:0 "Newspapers and televisions around the world broadcasted today Göring touring through Germania, greeted by crowds cheering his victory, with the Horst Wessel Lied being played by his bands and various banners of Göring's forces flying from windows and buildings. Surrounded by armed youth and loyal Heer soldiers, Göring delivered a firey speech to a mass of thousands proclaiming 'the dawn of a new Reich'.\n\nIn his oral manifesto, Göring promised a Germany 'that would set the world afire once more for the glory of the German people', and threatened his enemies with 'swift destruction under the Reich's iron boot', all with the imposing, cracked Volkshalle in the background setting the tone.\n\nThe international response has been telling. With the mobilization of military assets being announced by the United States and Japan, it seems that the three superpowers are beginning to prepare for what can be seen as another World War, looming in the distance."
 goering.2.a:0 "Finally, the Fatherland will be restored!"
 
 goering.3.t:0 "The Final Step"
 goering.3.desc:0 "The endless battle that has plagued Germany is now no more. Even as foolish holdouts attempt their romantic last stands, we claim victory for the Fatherland. The armies of the degenerate traitors have been cut down, and the German spirit for war reinvigorated. Now, Göring sets his sights on the last barricade to unifying the Reich - Speidel, his former commander Erwin Rommel, and armed units dedicated to defending Germania. Somehow, our Welthauptstadt has remained relatively unharmed in the civil war, and citizens of Speidel's territory has hailed the militarymen as heroes for saving the city.\n\nTo finish this conflict and bring about a new order in the world, we must ask Speidel and his men to stand down and let us enter. This decision is his, however, and we must wait to see the reply."
 goering.3.a:0 "The Reich will rise once more!"

 goering.4.t:0 "Germania Surrenders to Göring"
 goering.4.desc:0 "Since the moment we submitted our request to Speidel, the German nation has been unified in worry for fear of Speidel's response. This tension, however, has dissipated following the announcement, made by Rommel in front of international cameras, that Speidel would surrender Germania to Göring's forces peacefully and issued an order for all military forces of the city to lay down arms, an order most welcomed by the weary guards of Germania. Following the announcement, Germany erupted in joy and relief as nationwide, beer halls and pubs were flooded with crowds of citizens and off-duty soldiers desperate for a drink. Although supply was short in everywhere but Germania, it appears that peace has finally arrived to a battered Reich that needs it. For now."
 goering.4.a:0 "A toast to our power!"

 goering.5.t:0 "Germania Refuses to Stand Down!"
 goering.5.desc:0 "The German nation, scarred by its own blood and overworked by its own soil, has awaited with unabated tension over Speidel's answer to our requests for his forces to stand down. It seems, however, Germany is not at peace just yet, as the damned fool has announced that he will not lay down weapons, and instead called up Germanians to fight against our armies. Such an announcement has troubled our citizens, and we must take steps to correct this grave error as soon as possible. Although this battle is one we can win, it will be costly, and will destroy the Welthauptstadt we have worked so hard to build."
 goering.5.a:0 "Those damned foxes will see the real might of Göring!"

 goering.6.t:0 "The Germania Corridor?"
 goering.6.d:0 "The war drags on, and sees no sign of ending. Many worry the Civil War is approaching a new stage : absolute anarchy.\n\nWith no central authority and the fatherland being devoured by its children, the various pretenders states are losing their ability to supply their cities, and famine has begun to spread across the devastated country. One thing is clear, the war needs to end, and soon.\n\nThe Generals are calling it the Germania corridor. This city has been highly militarised by Speidel and his men will not be an easy fight to win, but if we were to overthrow him and break through the other side, it could be enough of a push to swing the war in our favor, as well as secure us the prestige of winning back the city.\n\nOff course, Speidel will be a difficult egg to crack, but if we do not do it, surely someone else will try soon."
 goering.6.a:0 "We march on Germania!"
 goering.6.b:0 "We will be crowned in peace"

 goering.7.t:0 "German Raumonaut, Eberhard Köllner, Lands on Moon!"
 goering.7.desc:0 "On the 19th of January, 1962, Eberhard Köllner, using a rocket based upon the A9/A10 design from WW2, and as a member of a team led by acclaimed scientist Wernher von Braun, became the first man to ever land on the moon. While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition, and that Köllner, who was photographed giving the characteristic Nazi salute at the flag as the Earth rose in the horizon, was the perfect example of a hero of Germany.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich."
 goering.7.a:0 "Congratulations are sent."
 goering.7.b:0 "The competition is strong."

 goering.8.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 goering.8.d:0 "Unexpected news has reached us from Northern Germany today. It seems that the reformist liberals, led by the traitor Albert Speer, have approached us with an offer of ceasefire. Unfortunately, this is not because they wish to join our cause- rather, it is because a threat greater in their eyes than our faction has popped up.\n\nReinhard Heydrich, unquestionably one of the worst men in all of the Reich, has been steadily gaining power and influence while the other factions have fought with each other. He is now powerful enough to be a recognizable threat, on par with Bormann and Speer. This has worried the Speerites, who are now approaching us with an offer to put aside our differences and destroy the common threat- that of the SS and their foul Burgundian System.\n\nOf course, it's a common belief among our soldiers that we could easily deal with SS rabble without the help of some student militias, but the freed up soldiers would certainly be quite the help in crushing this menace once and for all. It is our decision to make."
 goering.8.a:0 "A ceasefire will work for now."
 goering.8.b:0 "We don't need his aid."

 goering.9.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact"
 goering.9.d:0 "Unexpected news has reached us from Southern Germany today. It seems that the Reich's conservatives, led by the traitorous Martin Bormann, have approached us with an offer of ceasefire. Unfortunately, this is not because they wish to join the cause- rather, it is because a threat greater to them than we are has approached.\n\nReinhard Heydrich, unquestionably one of the worst men in all of the Reich, has been steadily gaining power and influence while the other factions have fought with each other. He is now powerful enough to be a recognizable threat, on par with Bormann and Speer.

 goering.10.t:0 "The Dutch send volunteers"
 goering.10.d:0 "Now that the dust has settled in the RK Niederlande and De Rochemont is in charge, the new Dutch government has decided to gather and train a division of volunteers to send us."
 goering.10.a:0 "Our thanks to the Dutch"

 goering.13.t:0 "The Ascension"
 goering.13.d:0 "Traces of smoke still hung over Germania the day of Göring's ascension, blown in by the winds coming off the North Sea and over the burnt remnants of thousands of homes, vehicles, fields, and everything else that could catch fire. It did not deter the thousands of Germanians who flocked to the streets to see their new Führer.\n\nThe parade was endless- thousands of soldiers proudly marching through the streets, trucks upon trucks streaming through the roads, followed by hundreds of tanks. Finally, in a Mercedes convertible surrounded by soldiers of all sorts of units, the Führer rode his chariot towards his coronation. Flowers dumped down on the men, thrown from windows as the greatest city on Earth welcomed its new conqueror.\n\nAt the steps of the Volkshalle, Göring stepped from his car to the roar of the crowd. As he walked up towards the building, he stopped, turned to the parade, and waved his hand- all it took for the streets to explode with frenzied cheering. There was no doubt now- Germany would be strong again, and the whole world would know it."
 goering.13.a:0 "A new era beckons."
 
 goering.15.t:0 "Rally Against The Beast"
 goering.15.d:0 "In the ruins of Germany's cities, the chants of the opposition and of the youth roared as loud as guns and bombs once did during the civil war. And from the universities and schools, what remained of the student movement emerged with a renewed defiance against the victorious lion, the promised Führer of a new Fatherland.\n\nIt was a surprise to see them still alive. Nobody really thought they would keep on with their passionate stand against the militarist forces of Göring. And yet, here they were\n\nTheir numbers grew and their protests spread. Soldiers and policemen rushed to meet them, to keep them from accomplishing what they hoped for. Some succeeded but others were not; for every demonstration they crushed with the club or the rifle, there were two more which crushed them back with the petrol bomb or the rock.\n\nJust like the embers of a dying fire made fresh again with air and fuel, so were the students who stole weapons from the dead or fleeing security forces. Just like the rising form of a phoenix, the students, filled with rage that only comes as a second wind, denounced the victors and threatened the returning peace.\n\nThis all shook up the German people once more. They watched from their broken windows or from their dirty workplaces as these young men and women tried to fight again for what they stood for. Most of them wanted peace, for this to finally come to an end, even if Göring was the one victorious and not Speer, Heydrich nor Bormann.\n\n"Give it up already!" some would tell the students, "The war is over! What's left for you to fight for?" And in response, there was only contemptuous silence or a barrage of proclamations, all rebellious, that defied what was already set in stone. Yet, the students would keep on marching, protesting, fighting back. Even if it meant their death or a fate much worse, they didn't seem to have any other choice. To capitulate was anathema to them; to not dissent was more outrageous than it is to stand up to what's happened, even in defeat."
 goering.15.a:0 ""They are just wasting their energy.""


 goering.16.t:0 "The Great Purge"
 goering.16.d:0 "The great lion and the colossal wolf have won. Their most powerful enemies lie dead, their blood soaking into the earth of Germany, leaving to their mercy the countless young and foolish students who dared to stand up to them, the dissidents who roused them to action, and the bankers who funded them all. They, and everyone else who, in vain, stood or seeks to stand in their way, would all be liquidated.\n\nBy the will of the victorious Führer, Hermann Wilhelm Göring, and his most inexorable lieutenant, Ferdinand Schörner, the fates of all those who failed to stand against them shall be equal if not worse than those exterminated in the wars before.\n\nGreat numbers of students were rounded up and forced into camps to be brutally disciplined according to the standards of the Wehrmacht. No matter who they are, where they came from, and what they believed, all of them shall not be spared the rod. On pain of death, they will obey.\n\nAs for those who sought to disturb the political happiness of the Fatherland, they will be hunted down and arrested without fail. Be they brave souls who promoted socialism, democracy, reformism, or the like, their virtues shall be stomped upon by the boots of those who value the law of the land. So that they may not disturb the peace once more, their lives shall be spent behind bars else they find themselves buried in a vast unmarked grave.\n\nAnd finally, the parasites who deceive the people to steal their money shall be neutralized. Their greed will not deliver them from the accounting which the Führer seeks to employ. And their wretched hands shall not touch another coin nor bill. No. They will, like all the others, be made to bare their necks to the claws of the lion and the jaws of the wolf.\n\n"
 goering.16.a:0 "No wasting mercy on the scum of the earth."

 goering.17.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
 goering.17.d:0 "The lion of a man sighed and a tired grin appeared on his old face. He walked down the empty and fairly lit hall, the one the late Adolf Hitler walked down himself, with his fellow victor, Field Marshal Schörner, by his side. They paused short of the doors that kept them out of the office from where the father of the great Reich once worked, leading the German people.\n\nThe successor turned. "Field Marshal, I have immense confidence in your abilities. I'd like to ask you a significant favor for our victory. Take care of the cleanup. Keep your hand in the details of the martial law we have just declared. I think you can do that by-"\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Schörner quickly interrupted with a nod, "and those students and their arrogant allies in the banks, along with those dissident bastards from the camps will be dealt with. Strongly. I'll personally see to it."\n\nThe former pilot with grizzled hair blinked at him. Then he chuckled, shrugged, and said, "Really. Very well then. I give you the liberty of doing what must be done. Just don't take too long, all right?"\n\n"Of course not." Schörner thought his new Führer a little too histrionic. Well, not a big deal. It's natural for a flyboy like him to play with army officers for favors. "I'll see to the-"\n\n"Just make sure that nobody breaks the curfews and pisses us off with any tricks. The sooner those pests and their supporters are taken care of, the sooner our country can lick its wounds and get to work," the Führer said, all too quickly. The field marshal looked up. Then he gave a nod. Schörner saluted him. He turned away and marched off, Göring watching him disappear.\n\nThe old, great lion who won the war for Germany's conquests to be added to now twisted the knob of the door and stepped in. The door closed. And the ruthless wolf who fought that war for him, so he may spill the blood of more of the Fatherlands enemies, looked back, whispering...\n\n"
 goering.17.a:0 "I'll cauterize the wounds of Germany."

 goering.18.t:0 "Students Arrested"
 goering.18.d:0 "They were the future of the Fatherland, yet all they did was ruin it with their dreams; all too lofty and all too degenerate. Too bad for their families, and too shameful for those who believed their disgusting promises for a grand future.\n\nThey all have to pay for their stupidity as soon as they arrive in the camps. There, their virgin hands shall labor; there, their big brains shall wonder about the measure of their rations and the weight of their loads; and there, they shall learn all about the rewards of placing their hopes in a cowardly old man who has never served the Fatherland except to save himself and his wretched thralls.\n\nIf they do figure out what is right for them, then they better work hard and stop complaining about the fucking slaves and the stupid natives. Until they accept what's good for them and their peers, they don't deserve to be restored into the Fatherland's tent again. If they don't get that into their thick skulls, there won't be any escape from the mouths of the lions and wolves who are certainly better than them.\n\nThe roundup of these annoying students and their leaders shall be a simple thing to carry out. If they resist, they're to be shot. If they give in, they're guilty enough to be sent to the camps.\n\nYet, it just isn't enough to discipline these upstarts of that bloody architect. There is no excuse for the youth who failed to persuade their naive classmates from rebellion. They too are guilty for their reluctance.\n\nAt least we won't worry about funding those fancy universities now. Their beloved professors can sit on their desks and spin on their chalks. They too shall be arrested and sent out of sight. All of the Fatherland has no need and no love for people too educated and too intelligent for their own good.\n\nUltimately, this is only the beginning of the end for anyone too stubborn to see that the only right way is the mighty way.\n\n"
 goering.18.a:0 "Take those fucking kids out of here!"

 goering.19.t:0 "The Bankers Bleed"
 goering.19.d:0 "Greed is not good. And anyone who thinks they can leech off the good, strong, and bold German people shall be left with nothing, banished beyond the Fatherlands comforts and markets.\n\nThe new Führer had his eyes upon these rich parasites since the waning days of Hitlers reign. Now he reigned the Fatherland in his wake. Even if they do whatever spineless things they are perfectly capable of doing, they won't get the chance, not when he starts pressing his black boot against their necks. And that is despite his own dream of reshaping the economy of the Reich. Without them, he shall be master of the Reich's wealth, free to use it for his own purposes and the greater needs of the people.\n\nFor now, it was important to really sink the teeth of the state into their assets and their very persons. He ordered no mercy in his pronunciations against the hoard rats. He denounced them for their "crimes against the personal wealth of each and every German citizen." And he insulted them as economists and monetarists who are as corrupt as the Jews. He even went so far as to accuse them of serving themselves; of being under the dirty paws of Jews - if they were not Jewish themselves.\n\nAnd naturally, they were swiftly dealt with in any manner available. From simply refusing to do business with them up to crafting unfortunate accidents that befell them, the good Führer would let these slide. As long as they help him throw those rapacious financiers out of society, he would not need to apply Germany's justice against them.\n\nAfter all, the natural enemy of the Fatherland was not those who served the Führer's interests but those who sought to be opportunistic; to squeeze them out like the thieves they are, returning their booty to those who rightfully possess it. That is how Göring and the Fatherland made new shall prevail in the absence of those goblins.\n\n"
 goering.19.a:0 "Germany can live without this league of pests."

 goering.20.t:0 "Faith in the Gun"
 goering.20.d:0 "A man in his field uniform stepped into the classroom, his eyes drawn towards the students waiting in their seats, as their professor stood by his desk. The soldier didn't let his sight linger in one place, always bringing it from left to right. Entrances, exits, pathways, and obstacles; he stopped to look forward and walked to the front, then turned sharply, facing the center.\n\nHe let his left hand reach down, groping at an empty belt. The man bit his lower lip, remembering that he was not in a place that allowed for weapons. This was a school, the thought came across his mind. You'll get it back.\n\nThe professor spoke to his students, who either seemed intimidated by this visitor or, perhaps, excited. A few showed no emotion, only curiosity.\n\nThe man waited for his own chance to speak. Patiently, of course. But the way the man spoke, with its awe; its naivety; its ignorance - his voice annoyed him. His left hand groped for the empty space by his belt once more. Nothing to hold; nothing to bring up and shoulder; nothing to give him some measure of control, of safety. Just as sweat dropped down his neck.\n\nWhen the older man stopped speaking and returned to his seat, the soldier - an experienced rifleman who had served as the Fatherland saw fit for him to serve in whatever place, then serving once more to win the Fatherland for the new Führer - stiffened.\n\nThoughts raced through his head, as bullets once did by his ears. A nervousness rang as ruined bells inside his equally ruined mind. And the full measure of the past rose back up to the surface, tormenting him with the truths of war as these students seemed not to really comprehend anything at all.\n\nThis war of mine, he said to himself, reminding his conscience, is not theirs to thoroughly appreciate. He wished himself to will through and speak about his experiences as they were to him; raw, brutal, and traumatic. But the state would not permit it; war was a glorious thing, as the new Führer declared for a new Germany.\n\nHis left hand pressed against his thigh. And he began to speak, choosing to lie to them - to lull them into the dream of conquest and of power they wanted to believe. At least, in his brand new attire, he would look good as he got this over with; yet, within, his heart seemed to tug at the seams."
 goering.20.a:0 ""Children of the Fatherland, I give you war.""

 goering.21.t:0 "Pride in the Führer"
 goering.21.d:0 "Hermann Wilhelm Göring, the former president of the Reichstag; former minister president of Prussia; and above all, the man who, from its birth up to its greatest victories over the Allies and the vanquished Soviets, created the vast Luftwaffe. Now, he is the Führer of the Reich. Now, he is the man who has saved Germany from all their enemies, both within and without.\n\nNo longer shall the likes of Speer dare to corrupt the youth with delusions of freedom; no longer shall the ilk of Heydrich seek to bring the Reich under the influence of the traitor Himmler; and no longer shall the bastard Bormann hope to trap the people in the false bliss of the status quo. Unlike these men the great hero of a new Germany, lifting it by the dirtied hand out of the ashes of a terrible civil war launched by these jealous men.\n\nNever again shall Germany be without a hero as mighty, as bold, and as single-minded as the Führer! Therefore, it is declared that each and every building possessed by the government, that each and every structure owned by the public, shall bear his portrait. Though he may not always be with us in person, he shall always watch over us in spirit.\n\nThe radios and the televisions too shall declare what a wondrous leader he is. They shall proclaim his victories and speak of his men, who are brave enough to meet the challenge of protecting this new Germany for the people who believed that the best way forward into the future, through the drudgery of time, through the difficulties of war and the decay of peace, is only in the never-ending confidence in the strength of our armies, our fleets, and our soaring wings. Just like in the wars fought so long ago to reclaim the glory lost in the First World War, so shall our future conquests be for the good of Germany's happiness!\n\nOur faith is in our dear Führer Göring. Just as we have placed faith in Hitler, so shall we give him our deepest and most unshakable faith. Germany forever shall be victorious! And Germany alone shall live on!\n\n"

Many more crammed Hamburg's streets, striving to hear the new Führer's first address to the public.\n\n"We will go down in history as the rightful successors of the German Reich; after all, it was I that our late Führer Adolf Hitler placed his trust in to protect Germany from these traitors, communists, and weaklings! We have forgotten the true path that made Germany strong. Germany did not become powerful by licking the boots of the Jewish vipers in the west while feeding the slavs in the east out of our own pockets, No, no, no! Germany became strong by Conquest! Germany became strong by bayonet and bullet! We threw off the chains of Versailles and crushed the mongrel empires of France, Britain and Russia, the German people have remade themselves in blood and iron! Today, we retake Germany from those who would prostitute her glory like the traitors of Weimar my comrades!. We will destroy the bootlicker Bormann, the puppet Heydrich, and Speer, the accursed liberal!"\n\nTop Militarists generals led the crowd in saluting the new Führer, including Ferdinand Schörner, new Field Marshal of the Militarist German faction."

To these humble exemplars of German industry, our beloved Führer has decreed the honour of serving in 'Fabrikbataillons' - Factory Battalions. An entire Fabrikgrenadier Division will be raised! They will complete the orders for their own weapons and then march into battle bearing their own creations and thus will be extra motivated. After all what is finer than going to war with a weapon you yourself created with your own two hands!\n\nThis surge in manpower will surely overcome the brief, only temporary shortfalls in production as new crews (Comprised of the elderly, the sick, the infirm and women.) are trained to replace them. Our beloved Führer has received promises that the various factories will not only meet targets, but will exceed them thanks to the inspiration provided by these brave men."

Keeping our soldiers happy is the most important thing as we will ask them to go to the death for our beloved Führer on the morrow.\n\nSo what if a panzerkompanie has lost a third of its vehicles because they have been driven drunkenly into ditches or houses. These men shoulder a burden for the Reich and if they wish to have a drink, then they should be able to have one!\n\nAlthough we should probably look into the morphine shortage affecting many frontline medical units. Clearly this means not enough morphia is reaching the men! We shall redouble the rations of it, and increase the supply of pervitin! Doubling the men's pervitin ration shall help us ensure final victory over the SS, liberals, and conservatives!\n\nSome enterprising units have even begun to supply themselves with combat stimulants. Cooking batches of the drugs in portable labs operating just behind the frontline. The Führer has even gone so far as to praise these men, calling them "(...) a credit to the self-reliance of the German grenadier."."

Führer Göring was appointed by Hitler himself to lead the nation after his death, his oldest, most trusted companion! Soldiers are inclined to grumble and complain, it is their lot after all, but sedition must be torn out root and stem.\n\nTo this end the Führer has enacted Führer Decree 267, the expansion of the Feldgendarmerie into the ungentlemanly aspect of political officer. The Feldgendarmerie will now directly attach teams to frontline units, monitoring the men's morale and ensuring that the threat of sedition is held at bay. \nNightly lectures on Mein Kampf! Weekly showings of Triumph of the Will! (The edited version of course) \nThe unsavoury rumours of flying court-martials, are just that: rumours.

Field Marshal Schörner spoke about the need for such panzers to replace the ones already lost at the front, noting that with such tanks, final victory would be within the Führer's grasp soon. \nThe concept of the Volkspanzer is that the armoured shells of the panzers would be distributed to sites likely to be attacked by the enemy, where local crews could easily attach the hulls to standard farm tractors without complicated tools, presenting an iron wall to the enemy where ever he attacks! \nThe Volkspanzers are built of recycled steel normally unsuited for armour plating. They are armed with six spare MG34s rather than MG3s and crewed by eight men. The most modern armament is the mounting for a recoilless rifle on top of the vehicle to provide the Volkspanzer with an anti-panzer punch!\n\nSome vile, seditious wretches have suggested that the resulting 30 tonne, 20 kph vehicle is not really the vehicle that we need to win the war, and that we should be focusing on proven weapons of war. They are wrong! This is a total war and we must be ready to mobilise the entire population at once!"

Farms are entirely given over to nothing, abandoned by all workers and now lost to infestations of weeds. The Baltic fishing industry has ground to a complete standstill, their sailors and fishermen gone to the Kriegsmarine. Their vessels rusting at anchor or pressed into service as minesweepers.

His room was a black box in all meanings of the word, with only his small reading lamp providing a bare minimum of illumination. Satisfied that he was as safe as he could make himself, he opened his desk drawer and slowly pulled out the small book buried underneath the mess of papers within.\n\n"All Quiet On The Western Front" it was called, by Erich Maria Remarque. It was about the life of a soldier in the first World War, the one Grandpa had fought in. Only, where all his other favorite books about that conflict had spoken of noble it was to fight, the glory of battle, and as always the shame of being stabbed in the back, this one told quite a different story. The soldiers lived horrible, filthy lives in the trenches. The rats alone were enough to make him queasy and all the horrible death. It didn't sound anything like what he had been taught in school. No wonder he wasn't supposed to be reading it. When Professor Herren had handed him the book some time ago, he had made Hans promise not to tell anybody about the gift. Of course, Hans had seen the title on the lists of banned books before, but it wasn't until he had actually read it did he realize why he had been forbidden to.\n\nA knock on the door made him freeze in fear.\n\n"Hans, are you asleep?"\n\nHe turned the lamp off, hid the novel, and darted into his bed. The sound of his mother's feet moving away told him he was safe. He had only gotten through a few more pages tonight, but that was fine. He would finish it no matter how long it took him."

In a terrifying case, a Battalion was issued Second World War era Kar98s that had somehow been assembled with the bolts from Russian Mosin-Nagants, leading to six deaths as the rifles catastrophically failed. This specific case is just one of many considering the deluge of reports about anti-tank rockets failing to launch and exploding a foot away from the launcher; hand grenades with faulty fuses exploding in our grenadiers hands; or panzer engines self-immolating the second they are moved from their railway wagons.\n\nMany generals are now pointing fingers at the Führer's removal of skilled personnel from the factories to form scratch battalions as a cause for these problems.

Following the Field Marshal, Germany's loyal Generals took their place either side of a red carpet leading to a great podium erected in the Großer Platz.\n\nThe Germania philharmonic orchestra struck up Wagner's 'Die Walküre' as 100 spotlights illuminated the gathering darkness in pillars of light, recalling the 1935 party rally. At this signal, a flight of helicopters swooped over the Avenue of Splendours, with the Führer's own helicopter landing gracefully in the Großer Platz. To cries of "Heil Göring" the Führer made his way to the podium, receiving the salute of the assembled Generals. Retiring General Rommel then presented the Führer with the keys to Germania, formally welcoming the Führer to his rightful place in the capital.\n\nThe Führer then made his first official address to the nation.

In some of the largest gatherings of non-military persons in several years, the Humboldt University Students' Union has gathered near and around the Kleiner Tiergarten. According to local reports the gathering is largely peaceful with the exception of loud chanting and terrible youth music.\n\nThe Führer's office has surprisingly declined to issue a statement on the student protests.

Göring had not had the chance to indulge himself in such a manner since before the Civil War, and this occasion was the perfect opportunity to present his grandeur as the new master of Germany to the people, and more importantly, to the military.\n\nNormally, the promotion of an officer, even an exceptional one as was the case here, would not call for such pageantry. Or at least that would be the state of affairs under Hitler, but Göring was not Hitler, and that was no secret. His passion for opulence and appearance was a critical factor in all that he did and now that he was free to do as he pleased, public events would become much more frequent and much more grandiose. Besides, the Führer wished to celebrate those officers who had served him so well against the traitors.\n\nHans Speidel called from a roll, "Johannes Steinhoff, step forward." Speidel's presence was supremely important. These were the officers that were selected to counterbalance Schörner's clique, whether for their support for Göring or Speidel didn't matter as long as they were not lackeys of the Chief of the OKW. The man that had just called up was one of those handpicked by the Führer himself. Steinhoff, like himself, had the blood of a pilot through and through, and Göring had already marked him as one to keep close by his side. This promotion would allow the much-deserving man to lead the Luftwaffe to glory as now that Göring was above personally directing its actions. More importantly, it would give Göring a much-needed reprieve from the duties of the office.\n\nThe Führer smiled as he placed the shoulder straps of a General der Luftwaffe on Steinhoff's uniform and gave him an almost paternal pat on the back as the newly-minted general moved to retake his seat. Göring would make the Wehrmacht his own, officer by officer. Speidel checked Steinhoff's name, and moved to the next one down."

When Adolf was alive he had envied the position of the leader of all the Reich, but now that he had it? Well he certainly didn't begrudge the authority, but he was not a fan of all the work.\n\nThe lisping voice of a man brought him out of his task. It was Steinhoff. Anyone else and Göring would have thrown them out, but if the head of his Luftwaffe wanted a meeting, then he could overlook the interruption.\n\nGöring gave one more look over of the baton before addressing the waiting general, "Yes, Herr Steinhoff? What brings you to my office this fine day? Does the Luftwaffe need more funding again? I told you, you don't need to come to me for anything else. All you have to do is take what you want."\n\nSteinhoff shook his head, pushed his sunglasses back up to fully cover his eyes, "Err, no my Führer, it's a matter of foreign affairs actually. Herr Axmann agreed that you would probably want to know that we've reestablished contact with Feldmarschall Milch in Madagaskar." That got Göring's attention.\n\n"Hmmm... I see.

Still, I had the utmost faith in your skills as a commander and was not surprised to hear that you triumphed over the rat Maurice and the upstart natives and Jews.\n\nI understand that you must be very weary of being trapped in such a precarious situation and I am here to offer all the support of the Reich and reestablishing German order in Madagaskar. You and your garrison will be allowed back into the Pakt and granted full reprieve and rest after your great service to the Reich and its people.\n\nPlease accept Erhard, I would be delighted to host you for a time at Carinhall. Of course, should you refuse, I am afraid I cannot guarantee your safety at that point. The Reich requires the island, and it will have it one way or another. I would prefer it to be on friendly terms.\n\nYour old friend,\nHermann Göring, Reichsmarschall and Führer of the Greater German Reich"\n\nMilch read through the letter once more, hardly believing it. He had half convinced himself that he would never be free of this damned island but here it was, a way out at long last. Sure, it had been Göring who had gotten him stuck here in the first place, but at the time that had seemed like a mercy compared to what the racial purists had wanted.

Göring was walking through the Rechskanzlei with Milch, introducing him to everyone worth knowing in his regime. His old friend had been quiet for most of the tour, only giving the courtesy-required greetings but nothing more. He looked quite tired and frankly malnourished, although Göring had decided not to bring it up for politeness' sake.\n\nThe reestablishment of Reichskommissariat Madagaskar had not gone entirely as smoothly as he had hoped to be honest. The XVI. Armeekorps had been dispatched to relieve the skeleton garrison and had immediately been set upon by rebel bands still active across the island. At least with the island's airfields retaken they could launch air raids against known hideouts but still, it was shaping up to be a long and difficult slog.\n\nMilch clearly had needed some time to rest, and so Göring had relieved him of his duties and placed his second-in-command Werner Goldberg in charge for the time being. Officially it was only going to be a temporary vacation but seeing Milch in person had made Göring doubt if the man would ever willingly return to the island. Ah well, that was a hassle for another day."

Schörner's words might have been a humorous quip from the mouth of anyone else, but the man did not even crack a smirk. Göring was mentally comparing his top general to an iceberg when Steinhoff jumped into the conversation.\n\n"I'm afraid I must side with Marshal Speidel here; we simply don't have the ability to support ground operations in Madagaskar. The closest airfields are on the African mainland and we haven't had access to those since the South African War. Our forces would be easily pinned down and left to die."\n\nSchörner scowled, and Göring was sure he heard the word "coward" muttered. If anyone else had heard they were keeping it to themselves for the moment.\n\nAll eyes turned to Puttkamer, who had not uttered a word the entire meeting. He did not appreciate the looks, and quickly moved to shift responsibility, "I will support whatever plan the Führer goes with, it's not my place to judge when he is present."\n\nBoth Schörner and Speidel groaned, but the admiral did have a point. None of their arguments with each other mattered so long as Göring had the final say. They didn't need to ask the question obviously in their minds.

A fine organization indeed, but then again I hardly need to tell you that of all people." Axmann chuckled politely, wondering where this was headed.\n\n"Well anyhow," Göring picked up his place again, "the HJ was all well in good but it was made to serve Adolf you understand.

A few empty seats away sat Speidel, who at least lacked his rival's unnerving countenance. Still, even if he wasn't as utterly humorless as the butcher, he didn't seem all that particularly happy either.\n\nBut so what? They weren't the Führer , they weren't in charge, and they weren't being promoted. Let them sulk, Göring thought to himself as he watched his uncle ascend to the dais where he had presided as president under the late Hitler. He would show them that he too could lead armies across Europe and beyond. What could they do but sit and watch. Sure, they might play tough and kings of the hill but at the end of the day it was his uncle whose word was law of the land and it was Heinrich who could sway his uncle.\n\nHe tried not to let his smile show as his uncle invited him to stand beside him, to bask in the glory of the occasion as the assembled delegates of the party cheered and cheered.

While most of the army's upper echelons are divided bitterly between rival cliques, most notably those of Schorner and Speidel, the "New Guard" as they have been nicknamed are much less factional. That is not to say they are apolitical, but it cannot be denied that most of the newcomers have chosen not to favor any one side too heavily.\n\nWhile this has been a blow to the clique leaders, always in need of more allies, it is hopefully a sign that the age of militarists leveraging immense political power may be coming to an end.

This would be the shortest distance that our forces would need to cross, giving us the best chance at succeeding against the US Navy. However such a landing would lead to our main forces pushing through difficult terrain in Florida and it taking some time before we capture meaningful territory.\n\nAnother proposal which has fewer supporters is that a daring invasion be made in Connecticut, with the aim of launching a blitzkrieg down to capture New York and then cutting off Boston in the north. Organized from Greenland and Iceland, this would get us into the meat of the US faster, but would undoubtedly be more difficult both on the ground and on the ocean.

Such a resolution was not to be however, although the head of the OKW was seen hurriedly conversing with several adjutants.

As such, we have begun facing a wide array of push back on the matter. While this could be expected from the proles, it is becoming an increasing issue in the Reichstag, which seems to have some misguided beliefs in their own liberty to question our ruler after the Civil War.

While many are scrambling to discover exactly what happened, in Germania itself especially where numerous politicians have already gone on record blaming rivals and foreign powers both, the local medical community has already released a diagnosis.\n\nThe Führer had an acute stroke while in his office, and collapsed, which matches the descriptions the guards gave of a loud §Rthump§! in the room. The guards and other staff, fearing the wraith that would descend on them if they bothered the Führer during his personal time, did not investigate, and Göring died before finally being discovered by his assistant the next day.\n\nThe succession in the wake of the very sudden death remains unclear, and many international observers have voiced concerns over a second German Civil War that the nation can hardly afford.

However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out. That is until early this morning as a frenzy of communiques filled the airways.\n\nFamous naval hero Karl Dönitz took to the radio around 7am to denounce the 'turncoats who, in Germany's darkest hour, dare to strip her of the liberties she has enjoyed since her birth' - no doubt a reference to Hans Speidel disregard for the sanctity of the Reichstag. As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

It had only been a few weeks since the founding of the committee, and already its two heads seemed to be in direct opposition to each other. Nobody was really surprised by this development, but for it to have happened this quickly? Not a good sign for the future.\n\n"Generalleutnant Remer, I don't see why the Feltgrau we currently used must have such a sweeping overhaul. It has proven capable in the field. Such a motion seems like a simple waste of time to me." Mumbles of agreement rippled through the civilian side of the table, as Osenberg leaned back in his chair. Remer scowled and leaned into the table.\n\n"Do you not understand that we must advance in all fields, Herr Osenberg? The Reich must lead the world on all fronts, not just weaponry. If our men are not hidden, what use is their weaponry, or their machinery? No, we must forge ahead, no matter the cost. You look too much at the Reichsmarks and not enough at the materials, Osenberg. I know many of our highest ranking military men would approve of such a change, and they know the art of war more than you, if I may say so." Chuckles and clapping from the generals. Osenberg did not move.\n\n"Generalleutnant, I just don't see the point of it. Nobody except for the OKH and yourself is clamoring for a change. This will cost millions to research."\n\n"Well, why don't we put it to a vote then? See what this committee thinks. That is the point of it, is it not?" Remer smiled."

However, there were two letters in particular that Göring was waiting on- a letter from the OKH, located in Germania, and a letter from the Kriegsmarine, located in Theodorichshafen. When the two came in one day, Göring sidelined all other priorities to read them.\n\nIt had been quite the pain to wrestle the two high commands into handing over their R&D departments. While Schörner's followers seemed more than eager to get started on their projects, Schörner himself was uncharacteristically cautious on the matter, attempting to convince his followers to not dive headlong into their projects. Göring sighed at the thought of it- it seemed Schörner had at least seen that there was something going on behind the scenes. Hopefully, thought Göring, his heart will win out over his brain.\n\nSimilarly, much of the Speidelite faction seemed happy enough to gain more control over research efforts, but Speidel seemed to be suspicious of such a blatant move to placate the military. Göring had to give credit where credit was due- Speidel was no slouch when it came to brains, and he could tell that Göring was not showing his full hand.\n\nIn any case, both branches had been quite evenly split on their support or opposition to the GDRWI. Perhaps it was why these letters had taken so long to arrive. In any case, Göring hoped for the best as he tore the first one open.

As such, we are afraid that we must decline your request to us to transfer our research department to you. I would personally like to point out that-\n\nGöring snorted and slid the paper to the side.

Whatever Schörner had said to get his point across, it clearly had worked on those fools. This was no fatal blow- Göring had the time, patience, and money to get what he wished for, even through somewhat extralegal measures, but it would certainly put a dent in military research.

Speidel's clique had seen through the disguise, at least partially. Without the Kriegsmarine on board, Göring's opportunities to play the militarists would be limited.

Remer stood to a similar level of applause, though it was clearly concentrated more on the general's side of the table. Osenberg smiled, but one could tell it was a bit forced if they looked hard enough- Remer was Schörner's way of keeping his thumb on research, and was certainly going to be a pain to deal with. Nothing is perfect, Osenberg thought.\n\nWhen Remer's applause died down, Osenberg began to speak. "Our first topic will be on the subject of the standard infantry rifle. This is less on the quality of our current rifle and more on our quantity of them. Many of our frontline soldiers are still equipped with older models of rifle- I've even heard reports that some are carrying G43's. This is unacceptable, but the question is how we go about fixing it. My suggestion is that we transfer guns from the garrisons to make up the deficit, build some new ones, and replace the oldest guns with newer models to make up the gap. It won't fully solve our issues, but it will be economically sound. All in favor?"\n\nMumbling and debate rumbled across the table. Osenberg watched- he never expected such a suggestion to be a unanimous agreement- but he let out a small sigh when Remer got to his feet.\n\n"I must respectfully disagree, Herr Osenberg." Remer said with a grin. "We can't let our armies, the prides of the Reich, be equipped with suboptimal equipment any longer, in my opinion. We must be better armed than our opponents, shouldn't we? I propose that we devote as many resources as possible to rearming our soldiers with the best the Reich has, no matter the cost.

Brilliant agility, great speed, and the firepower to destroy anything the Americans and Japanese can muster. If the project goes ahead, I can guarantee that this will only bolster our armies." The scientist stuttered. Göring did not address these remarks, instead turning to Osenberg, who had still not moved.\n\n"Herr Osenberg, what do you make of this design?"

It's as big as a than a Tiger and half as useful. There's nothing good in it."\n\nThe scientist began to defend himself, but Göring cut him off with a wave of his hand. "No, no, Werner, I don't think you see the potential here. It's a blueprint- a prototype, isn't it?" Göring kept going before the man could answer. "Sure, there are flaws, but I see a lot of potential in this. Can you imagine the American reaction to getting run over by twin-gunned heavy tanks at 70 kilometers an hour?" He turned to the engineer, addressing him directly for the first time this meeting. "Tell your men to get to work on this Liger. I'm confident in your success.

He asked.\n\n"Our efforts to improve upon the original Liger design have hit a small snag. We've improved upon the engine- it's got more power, more speed, and can push the tank along at a quicker pace."\n\n"So what's the catch?" Osenberg asked. He had a feeling he could already guess, but he wanted to hear it from the man himself.\n\n"To produce this new engine, we'll need more time and more money. If you refuse, we'll do what we can to streamline the production of the old engine, but the speed of the tank may be a bit. . .less."\n\nOsenberg sighed again. He could already see it now- the Liger, an expensive money sink, a complete waste of time, and he'd catch all the blame for it. No matter that he was against the project from the start- Göring sure as hell wouldn't take the fall for him, friendly as the two were. Of course, perhaps the fundamental issues of the Liger could be fixed- or at least mitigated- with enough money and development. Who knows, perhaps it could become something workable. Asking for more time and more money would be a pain, but if it saved the project, maybe it was worth it.\n\nOsenberg turned back to the man, his mind made up.

His gaze lingered on the guns the longest, as if he could already imagine the cannons obliterating American tanks. The three men crewing the prototype watched closely as the Führer continued his loop around the tank, taking in every last bit of it. Finally, he motioned to his aides, and the party of officials departed for a nearby hill, from which they would observe the tests.\n\nIn a moment, the tank revved its engine and sped down the course. Göring watched intensely, gazing through the pair of binoculars he had been provided with. Occasionally, he'd make a side comment to one of the engineers, praising the speed of the tank or commenting on its majestic appearance. However, as the test went on, the praise began to fade.\n\nThe Liger, despite its beginning appearance, seemed to struggle as the test continued. The tank was only able to complete its shooting at a pace that barely trailed the Leopard, despite the twin guns' supposed strength. The engine, which once launched the Liger around the trials in a flash, began to pour black smoke. In a final coup de grâce, the Liger turned to fire upon its final targets, only for the first gun to be blown out of its mounting, flipping backward and tearing through the roof of the tank before slamming to a halt in the soft mud.

Inwardly, however, his mind was shot through and through with panic.\n\nThe plan that he and Göring had hammered out seemed to be going accordingly so far, but so many things could go wrong. If Schörner found out, the result could be catastrophic. If the plan was leaked, it would prove a massive embarrassment to Göring's administration. Even if the plan went correctly, what if Schörner and Remer managed to pass the blame themselves? It would eventually find its way back to the GDRWI, if not Osenberg himself, and then he would have another mess to deal with. Besides, how much had keeping the Liger's poor performance secret from the military already cost the Reich?

The two regarded each other with a hint of contempt before Osenberg began.\n\n"I have the resistance reports from Ukraine, my Führer." Osenberg stated, his voice cool and collected. Göring looked up and met Osenberg's eyes, the two staring each other down. "There was a slight increase in partisan attacks in the last weeks."\n\nThe words hung in the air like a vulture as Göring looked away from Osenberg and out the window. There was a silence between the two- something becoming all too common these days. Finally, Göring spoke up, still facing the window. "Is there a correlation between the drugs and the attacks?"\n\nOsenberg rolled his eyes. "No, it's within the normal ups and downs of attacks. The issue is that the numbers haven't dropped. There's been no effect. We've spent millions on this for no reason, and now we just look like fools. I've heard some worries from the military about our spending habits. The military is worried about our spending! Can you believe it?"\n\nGöring waited a moment to respond. "Can you remind them that this whole operation was their idea?" He replied.

That was some conspiracy-level nonsense, on par with believing in lizard-people and thinking aliens are mind controlling our leaders. At first, the rumor died out in the chain, and got no further than a small circle of skeptical friends.\n\nAnd then it cropped up in a different unit, and then another, and then another. Soon enough, these circles began to run into each other, and the theories only grew wilder from there as each realized that, no, they weren't alone. The whispers tore through divisions like wildfire, the theories as to what the drugs were doing growing more and more outlandish by the day. Suddenly, it was thought that Göring was trying to poison his enemies, that Osenberg was setting up for a coup, that Schörner was planning an execution of those who disliked him, that the Jews had infiltrated the highest ranks of the Reich and were planning a mass mind control campaign to destroy Nazism. All of these theories ran almost purely on conjecture and hypothesis, but that was all it took to buffett the conspiracy to even higher levels.\n\nWhen the first reports of the controversy hit Göring's desk, it was already far too late to stop the rumors. Nothing he could say would end the spiraling theories- if anything, they would only make them worse. Worst of all, Schörner undoubtedly had gotten wind of this as well, and had certainly made a plan to blow it all up in the Führer's face. Now, all Göring could do was wait for Schörner's move and deal with the fallout later."

Göring set down his papers and steeled himself- a wise choice, judging by how Speidel burst in, flames practically shooting out of his eyes, moments later. He didn't bother to take a seat, instead leaning over the desk and pointing a finger directly into Göring's face, who was forced to move back to avoid being poked.\n\n"What's all this about drugs in the water, Hermann? I had my units test the pipes myself and we found amphetamines! Amphetamines, Hermann! Were you trying to drug our soldiers?" Speidel shouted. Göring said nothing- he knew Speidel already knew the answer. "Not only that, Hermann, but Schörner contacted me with the same concerns! You made me work with Schörner, Hermann. Schörner! I hate the son of a bitch and he hates me! Do you have any idea how rare it is for Schörner and I to cooperate on something?"\n\n"Yes, I'm quite aware." Hermann muttered, his eyes cast low, fixated on a suddenly intriguing piece of paper on his desk. Speidel continued, but Göring no longer listened- he was too busy contemplating just how greatly he had erred. This had not blown up in his face- it had undergone nuclear fusion. With Speidel's clique now aligned against him along with Schörner's clique, was there anyone left in the army who trusted him?\n\nSpeidel left with a slam of the door, leaving Göring alone to ponder Osenberg's words of caution- and curse himself for not listening to them."

From the pilot's seat hopped a man in the dress of a common mercenary, a Sturmgewehr 45 slung over one shoulder; it was Siegfried Müller himself! Only moments before the Führer had been annoyed by the mediocre landing, but that was all forgotten now. The Führer gave a non-formal salute that Müller did not even bother returning, but Göring didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n"Herr Müller, it is so good to finally see you in person again! I had no idea you had taught yourself to fly helicopters during your time in Africa. It was most impressive to watch you in the sky if I may say."\n\nMüller flashed the smile that had won him adoring fans all across the Reich, "Why thank you my Führer. Yes, I did pick up some skills in my time, mostly for the purpose of getting to hunting spots you see, but I am thrilled to have impressed the great Reichsmarschall himself."\n\n"Hunting, yes I did know you were quite an exceptional marksman. We ought to hunt together at Schorfheide. You will come to Carinhall and stay a while to rest won't you?"\n\n"If it's you asking me then I would be delighted sir.""

Such a move will serve both as a reminder for the three mainland Reichskommissars that they have an ultimate loyalty to the Führer even if that position may have changed hands, but at the same time will make an excellent snub to those pathetic nations that were utterly embarrassed in their efforts to back South Africa.\n\nThe question now is where Führer Göring should head. Siegfried Müller in Zentralafrika would no doubt be able to regale the leader of the Reich with tales of exotic hunts and daring mercenary adventures. Schenck's shared experience in the sky with Göring will surely make for many enjoyable evenings spent in nostalgia. Hans Hüttig of Ostafrika may not be much of a conversationalist or host, but he did do the most to achieve this latest victory for the German people and deserves proper congratulations. As always, the final decision is up to Führer Göring."

The Führer reflected upon the fact that his host, who had been quite sullen and quiet up until this point, had almost seemed to come back alive when the topic of flying was mentioned. Göring had never considered himself a clairvoyant in matters of the heart, but even he was adept enough to recognize that the man was clearly more at home amongst the clouds than in an office. Perhaps, the Führer thought inwardly, he could have been such a man if things had gone differently.\n\n"So I've been told you were born here in South West Africa under the old Imperial colony?"\n\n"Yes my Führer, in Windhoek."\n\n"I see, I see. Did you know that my late father was the first colonial commissioner here? I suppose we both have our connections to one another, both in the lands we are tied to and the professions we have chosen."\n\n"You are no doubt right my Führer, but I must confess I believe I share nothing of your ability to lead others, much less a nation."\n\n"Perhaps," Göring mused, clearly appreciating the flattery, "but we cannot all be Führer material can we? We all must have our part to play in the hierarchy of life just and just as there is an apex predator in every food chain, I was simply destined to serve the German people as their leader." Schenck said nothing to the self-adulation billowing forth from his leader's mouth in a cloak of faux-modesty.\n\n"Er, my Führer," Schecnk seemed somewhat reluctant to speak, "perhaps some time soon we could discuss a possible change in my position? I must admit that I do not truly feel up to this most important of tasks any longer..."\n\nGöring nodded, but his attention was fixed on the trays of food being brought in by the native servants."

"You know, my father was a colonial governor much as you are now Herr Hüttig. Yes, he was in charge of the Imperial colony of Sudwestafrika and much like you he had the burden of bringing civilization to this poor excuse for a continent."\n\nNothing. Not even an acknowledgement that he had heard Göring speak. If the man had not been responsible for the recent victory in the war the Führer would seriously consider having him removed and sent to wallow behind a desk deep in the Wolfsschanze. So far, Göring thought, the only thing that had made this visit even semi-bearable was the excellent cognac that Hüttig had provided. It was frankly astonishing to the former Reichsmarschall that a man with such an unpleasantly austere personality would keep such a collection. He made a mental note to carry off as much as he could upon his return to Germania.\n\nJust as the Führer was beginning to lose all hope of ever getting his "companion" to engage in any sort of discussion, the Ostafrikan Reichskommissar seemed to burst into a frenzy of animated movement and speech like a jack-in-the-box springing out.\n\n"My Führer! My Führer it is good to finally be able to talk to you in person!" Göring was about to return the compliment but Hüttig did not let up, "We must talk about the others... I have very important information regarding them... very important information!" His words came in staccato bursts like the fire from a sturmgewehr. Göring was completely taken aback.\n\n"Herr Hüttig, please, settle down. If you have something so serious to discuss, I am sure we can talk it over at some other time in a more official capacity."\n\nThe words seemed to snap Hüttig back to reality, or so Göring believed when the man stopped his infernal shouting. As the Führer handed his host a glass of the cognac and began to attempt to entertain him with old war stories, he did not notice the dark, almost glassy look that had now settled on the disturbed zealot. He similarly failed to notice the twitching of the man's eyes, or the curling of the man's fists."

While the two bon-vivants were carousing, General Wilhelm von Thoma took the chance to converse with his former superior, the now retired Generalfeldmarschall Rommel.\n\n"You know," von Thoma offered, his voice noticeably charged with emotion, "I never forgot what you taught us in North Africa sir, and I never let my men forget it either."\n\nThe words of praise clearly affected the old warrior. "Herr Thoma, it means more to me than you could guess to hear that I had some value to the future soldiers of my Fatherland. It brings me some comfort in my twilight years."\n\n"Herr Rommel! Herr von Thoma!" The loud voice of the Führer interrupted the tender moment, "You should both get some sleep.

The Führer of the German Reich was, in a word, bored. He was desperately searching for something interesting to do, his mind racing from idea to idea without settling on any single one for very long. Inspect the tanks again? No, he had done that too many times since the Civil War had ended and it was getting stale. Head to the opera? He liked that one but Schörner would be too furious to make it worth it. Design a new wing for Carinhall? Now that sounded enjoyable but what if...?\n\nHe sprang from his seat in a flash of inspiration and snatched up one of the many phones for the numerous important connections he had to call into on a daily basis. This particular phone was marked 'OKW Headquarters'.\n\n"Yes this is Führer Göring. Yes, yes, Sieg Heil. Is Rommel still there? Good, good, put him on quick."\n\nQuiet blanketed the room for a few minutes while the heavyset dictator waited with barely contained excitement. Then, a new voice came through the other end of the line.\n\n"My Führer," Rommel's voice was still professional as ever, even in retirement, "how can I be of assistance to you?"\n\nGöring's face pulled into an almost impish grin, "Herr Rommel, pack your things, I'm going on a tour of our African lands and I want you to join me."\n\n"I - I suppose I couldn't refuse such a request from my Führer, now could I?"\n\nGöring's mask of geniality collapsed for a moment.

Into this frenzy of action and inaction stepped Johannes Steinhoff, who had hurried from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium as fast as his staff car would carry him. Moving to the center of activity, occasionally giving a hurried "Heil Göring!" to a passing officer, Steinhoff advanced to where he knew the Führer would be.\n\nHe found him, his face a dark red, in a state more furious and terrible than he had observed since the close of the Civil War. He was on the phone, and he was shouting, almost screaming down the line.\n\n"Tell Puttkamer I want a cordon established around their ports by the end of the week! Nothing gets in and nothing comes out without our approval and knowledge, do you understand me?" Without waiting for a reply, the dictator slammed the receiver down, hanging up.\n\nSteinhoff adjusted his sunglasses back to position nervously, "So, I take it that the rumors are true then?"\n\nGöring almost snarled at his air chief, "They are! That fucking bastard Hüttig has betrayed us! He has killed Schenck and has driven Müller underground. That's not what's important right now though Johannes. What's important is that we destroy him, we turn his ridiculous fucking 'Reichsstaat' into dust and ashes. That's where you'll come in - I want bombers over Quelimane today!"\n\nSteinhoff said nothing, just blinked. His words carefully chosen, the former pilot answered, "My Führer, if we really have lost the continent then it is logistically impossible for us to reach any targets within Hüttig's territory."\n\nGöring's face went purple, and for a moment Steinhoff had the half-humorous, half-grotesque mental image of the man popping like a balloon. Göring did not pop however, but after a tense moment he did seem to almost deflate back into his chair from which he had half-risen.\n\n"Fine then," he whispered sullenly, but as Steinhoff turned to leave he spoke up, "but tell Marshall Schörner to see me at once.

But I did expect that our forces would be advancing!"\n\nAxmann continued his silence.\n\n"Even the Americans cannot match the commitments I have made, damnit. The South Africans should be swimming in a shower of our artillery, and routing in response. I fail to understand why this war bleeds on so inconclusively.

I wish that I could stand before you today and say that the war ended with all of our noble aims fulfilled.\n\nI cannot say that however, because that would be false, and I have vowed to never speak an untrue word to the German people so long as I remain Führer. It is true, our battle has ended indecisively, without clear victory for our people. However, this does not mean we can simply give up now! Quite the opposite, we must redouble our efforts to the spread and preservation of our people and National Socialism across the world. Our outposts in Africa have been battered, but they still remain intact, our dreams shall not die until the last Aryan has perished from the earth.\n\nRest assured that those who have failed the Reich will be given their just deserts, and let this serve as an example to all those who serve the German nation: this is what happens when you fail! Even in failure however, we gain strength, just as we gained inner strength from the travesty of Versailles to embrace the truth of National Socialism, it is my belief that this momentary setback will be looked back upon in similar fashion. When future historians chronicle us, they will write of this as the moment a reborn German people, still scarred from the flames of civil strife, recommitted themselves to taking their rightful place.

Unfortunately, the unit proved unsuccessful at sinking any of the transports and inflicting more than superficial casualties while losing several men in the process. It seems that a major, fatal blow to the effort was struck when the Werewolf unit leader Hauptmann Friedrich von Tannenburg was killed in a skirmish at the Dam.\n\nUpon reaching the coast the small river transports headed north and we may yet catch them at one of the docks as they search for ocean-going vessels but I fear they have eluded us.

Aren't they grand?"\n\nGerhard attempted to feign disinterest, but he had the uncomfortable feeling that Remer could sense the deception from across the table. He shivered as he turned his gaze back from the butcher's protege and to his superior.\n\n"I... yes I agree my Fuhrer, these plans are quite exceptional""

goering.431.d:0 ""So that's it?" Göring fumed, "The war's over already!?" there was no one to respond, no one to talk to, no one to make excuses. Göring wanted to yell at someone, but the only people he could blame for this disappointing display were down in Africa. This would've been the perfect opportunity to showcase a renewed German might following the pain of the Bürgerkrieg, and that idiot had Hüttig botched it. He had thrown thousands of German soldiers, precious resources in their own right, into the meat grinder. And this was what he had to show for it? Unacceptable! Göring paced around his office.\n\nThis was an international relations disaster. Thanks to Hüttig, would the OFN simply strike at the weakened Reich? Would it extend its Judeo-Bolshevik tendrils further into Europe? Africa had been lost; what was next: Italy? Sweden? Finland? His mind raced with nightmares of a surrounded Reich unable to reassert its power.\n\nWith slow, deliberate breaths, the Führer calmed himself. This was a temporary setback, nothing more. The OFN had won the battle, but not the Cold War. This was all explainable by the Reich's still fragile position thanks to the traitors, no need to overthink it. Just like any setback in his career, the Führer reassured himself, he would come back and on top at that."

And yet, for all that, his eyes still burned with the same disturbing light that they always had.\n\n"What was that?" came from one of the prisoner's guards, his rifle to the ground but always angled so that in an instant he could put a round into Hüttig if needed.\n\n"I said," Hüttig began, his voice icy with contempt, "that you are all degenerates. Every last one of you who would treat a man who has devoted his entire life to the cause of the Aryan people like this."\n\nThe guard looked inquiringly at Goring, asking for permission to simply end the madman's ravings. The Fuhrer shook his head, "Let him say what he wants Franz. It's not like he can do anything anyways." A slight smile crept across the Fuhrer's face as he spoke the last line, sure of his absolute power.\n\nHüttig continued to rant as he was led towards the courtyard's wall, "You are the traitors here, not me. I served the Reich, the ideals of National Socialism, what do you serve Herr Goring? Whatever the generals want? Whatever fills your pockets? How can the Aryan people have fallen so low as to follow such scum? The Reich does not deserve to survive with you degenerates at its head!"\n\nGoring grunted, the man simply would not shut up. "Franz," he motioned lazily to the guard, "finish this embarrassment off please."\n\nWith an enthusiastic nod, Franz raised his rifle and fired off a quick series of shots. Hüttig groaned and started to sway, but managed to right himself from falling. The holes in his chest pulsed angry and red, fatal shots, but the man's sheer rage pushed him on.\n\n"Incompetent degenerates! The Reich is doomed to die with you and your masters in the Wehrmacht at the helm! It deserves whatever end you bring it, I'd rather see it burn then with such degeneracy in control. I would've... I would've..."\n\nHis voice weakened, his words trailed off, his legs gave way. It was over, Hans Hüttig was dead."

Not bad all things considered.\n\nThe news had come in the middle of the night when all but the most insomniac of the soldiers had long since passed out. A little spook from the Abwehr Kolonialbüro.

goering.707.desc:0 "Göring sat alone in his chambers, with but a tumbler of whiskey in his hand, silently contemplating the latest fiasco which Iberia once again revealed to the world. With the Italians out of Algeria and the government in Algiers at tatters, the Caudillos thought they could finallyclaim this land as theirs- and who better to govern this new fiefdom than their long-time lackey, Yves-Guerin Seraç, as leader of a French-minority military government? Göring smirked- this arrangement could go wrong in so many ways. And go wrong it did: Seraç didn't even bother to get comfortable in his new post before he denounced his overlords and established the State of Algeria as an independent entity on world politics. The idiots- they really need to learn to pick their subordinates.\n\nNot that he was in too enviable a position either. His own "subordinates" were already encircling the young warlord like hawks, fighting amongst themselves as to how to deal with him. Some believed that Seraç's clique would prove a valuable lapdog for the Reich, safeguarding the region's oil deposits and providing fresh untermenschen to throw in the front lines that would otherwise have been pure blooded Germans; others yet are disgusted at the idea of once again allowing collaborators to partake in Germany's moment of greatness, and insist on crushing all resistance and setting a new Reichskommisariat that will ensure all affairs are handled by proper German hands.\n\nSo Göring was left with a decision to make; a luxury he didn't get too often anymore. Personally he had way more important things to tend to right now than another shithole in Africa- and in a way, that made the prospect of just collaborating with Seraç and letting him do the dirty work very tempting. And if the man has an ounce of self preservation he'll surely cooperate. On the other hand, self preservation didn't stop him from betraying the very people who put him in power. And no matter how disillusioned he had grown through the decades, even old Hermann had to admit that asking an arrogant asshole in Africa for help like they needed him was just plain wrong."

goering.708.desc:0 "The General will see you now, gentlemen, and apologises for your wait" announced a sturdy male voice that made Valentin Scheller raise his head from his copy of Die Beobachter, where his attention had been drawn to for the last three hours. The voice belonged to a uniformed Pied-Noir, who then proceeded to bow and show the way to him and the disgruntled ministers besides him. But Scheller was calm; he knew by now why people like Seraç had to show they were "too busy" for people like him.\n\nIndeed, as they stepped into the grandiosely decorated room, one would think they were in a palace; just like one would think, as they looked towards the Lion of Algeria, Yves-Guerin Seraç, sitting in his designer suit with the air of a man who had won every battle of his life, warmly welcoming them with a sardonic smile, that this man had no doubts about this day. A lot of work and money was poured into this illusion, surely. But these men hadn't come all the way from Germania to stare at gold candelabras and fine paintings; and as the pleasantries faded away and the negotiations began, it soon became very clear to all involved that Seraç's deck was empty.\n\n...which makes it not only desirable, but integral, that the Ministry of Economy shall retain complete autonomy to dictate and direct its own budget, with the Dinar as its default currency, which shall remain pegged to the French Franc and not to the Reichsmark" was how the longly worded but in reality fairly short list of Algerian demands concluded, which included the retention of the established French-styled government and all French ministers within it, the sovereignty of the armed forces, with German garrisons in Algeria supplementing instead of guiding the Algerian command, as well as direct state control of at least 50% of the exploration perimeters of the national oil fields. The carefully crafted and practiced document that constituted another piece to Seraç's masterful bluff, described in the most intrepid light what his true goal -or pledge- was: to please be left alone and retain whatever authority he could over his small fiefdom. All this futile act confirmed Scheller's suspicion: Seraç had no way out, and had nothing to resort to but to beg. With the tiniest and rarest of smiles creeping up on his lips, he opened his own briefcase with calm, precise movements."

"I understand that the remaining deposits might fall short of your 50% goal, Herr Seraç, but Herr Göring is willing to offer subsidies upwards of 10 million Reichsmarks per year as reparation. As for the lands occupied by foreign investors, we are willing to aid you in their immediate eviction. After all, the Unity-Pakt should offer you much greater return in investment regarding all your exports." What he failed to mention was that the trading policies of the Unity-Pakt towards Reichsprotektorats mandated that any and all exports shall be controlled through Germania, from where they will be sold as German goods.\n\nAnd that's only a small footnote in the book of things that were not explicitly mentioned in the contracts. Like how the part about national-controlled oil fields did not mention endless nights of drinking with the President and major shareholders of Sonatrach, who had agreed to set the groundwork for a merger with IG Farben. Or how the part autonomy of the government did not mention the heavy handed deals that were scheduled after their arrival of German observers, or the unexpected... empty seats that would arise during their stay. Or how the support role of the German garrisons did not mention the astronomical bribes to several high-ranking officers. For Kirchmann and his business associates, this was what one would call a hostile takeover; for Seraç, this was the loss of whatever control he managed over his state, and the transformation of his perceived role as ruthless dictator into that of a powerless scapegoat for the colony's misfortunes.\n\n"I believe that will be all for now, Monsieur Seraç" interceded Scheller, standing up from the table as Kirchmann was packing his papers. "It is getting late. In the following week you will have plentiful opportunities to converse with us on the details." He gave a tiny smirk, a rare occurence. "I believe you will see that everything should be very advantageous for you and your administration. Bon nuit, gentlemen."

Algeria will indeed be recognised as a German Reichsprotektorat, and cede almost the entirety of the oil fields demanded during the conference - with the rest of them, officially under state ownership, following them within the next month.\n\nOur envoys are currently sailing back home, while a wave of permanent representatives is being scheduled to replace them soon.

Seraç will be brought to his knees before us, the people he so deeply cared about will be enslaved and subjugated, and everything we cannot take with us or drill out of the ground will be burnt to a crisp."

He reminisced the days that his contribution to his people was through actual blood and sweat, not paper sorting duty. But someone had to keep the state afloat- and there was no other man he'd trust that on but himself.\n\nHis train of thought was interrupted by the sudden sound of an incoming telegram- directly from his Chief of Navy. "GERMAN SHIPS SPOTTED -STOP- TWO BTLSHIPS EIGHT DSTRERS FOUR CRUISERS -STOP- THREE FIFTY KM FROM ORAN AS OF DAWN -STOP-" As of dawn? This was 11 in the morning! Why was he only hearing of this now?

And it better be about this sack of shit that calls himself an ad-" "Excuse me General but, you might want to check the TV. Now." The TV? Seraç quickly opened his TV to the Télévision Algérienne channel. "...got away with their boats unscathed, but their lines cut, and able to do little but hurl obscenities at the German ships." announced the reporter as the screen shifted to an unkempt bearded man. "Those bastards think they can just barge in as if this is their damn playground! How has the General allowed this?" The news ticker read: "Kriegsmarine violates Algerian sea zone, harasses local fishermen".\n\nSeraç closed the TV, and violently broke the remote on his desk. Useless! Useless! All of them! How could he, after all the pain and sacrifice he had gone through, have surrounded himself with such useless people? People that could only inform him of an impending invasion AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWS! Or was it not stupidity? Was his staff intentionally withholding this information from him until it could no longer be held secret? He could not know- he had lost too many friends to tell anymore- and did not care.

Within the following week they will be followed by the appropriate Garrisons and border divisions, three military engineer detachments, equipment and representatives from IG Farben, among others.\n\nWhile the scheduled reinforcement of the colony is fairly heavier than typical of other RKs, especially ones of this size, and their absence from the Fatherland will be noticeable for some time, this will hopefully allow Nordafrika to serve as the coordinative and administrative center for all our future ambitions in Egypt and the Maghreb."

He looked forward again, waiting briefly for a response that never came. "Neither did he; his demeanor was too calm." He puffed a ring of smoke. "It was Seraç himself who ordered this. He wanted you to be violent and ruthless. He wants to show he fears no one.

With the Bürgerkrieg over, the first and foremost task is to reclaim the closest lands to the proper Reich, the "greater" in the Greater Germany: more than a matter of pride, regions such as Bohemia and the Netherlands are home to important industrial hubs that will prove fundamental in future expansion plans.\n\nDozens of generals and admirals surround a large, rectangular table, whose head is currently occupied by two men in high uniform. The Führer, Hermann Göring, and his right-hand man, Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, look intently at the maps spread in front of them, though only one of them actually understands what they mean: despite his experience as a pilot ace, Hermann Göring has never been a general, and rather than maps, he prefers paintings, which he deems a much better use of canvas.\n\n"Gentlemen" begins the Feldmarschall, rousing the crowd from their ruminations.\n"The Reich still stands, but our empire has fallen apart. Without the resources and the manpower provided by the former Reichskommissariat, our war machine will never be able to recover in full: if we want to reclaim our right as Aryan masters of the world, then we need to strike now!" the Führer applauds his small speech, immediately followed by the rest of the Oberkommando.\n"It should be immediately evident to all of you how our most immediate targets should be these" he says, pointing his fingers at several highlighted nations. Denmark, Holland, Bohemia, Ostland, Poland and Slovakia.\n"These "nations" were the most closely integrated with the Reich, and are still reeling from the chaos of the rebellions.

Though every man clapped, there was no fervour. Half the hall was abandoned. The men who once sat in these empty seats were dead, slaughtered at the hands of the men who still held their power. Soon, all the hall would be abandoned, as Göring had announced his intentions to invade Böhmen-Mähren.\n\nDaleuge sat at his desk, motionless. He had it. He had his power. Maybe it was not where he wanted to be, but right now, everyone answered to him. And that was all he wanted. Now, some bloated, jumped-up warlord who calls himself the Führer of all Germans wanted to take this power that he had worked so hard for, and all that Daleuge could do was watch. Though no weakness would be shown to his men, he knew what the outcome of this war would be. At least he had the opportunity to make life as miserable for that gorged fool as he possibly could. He looked back at the papers in front of him, then tentatively he pulled a map from the drawer next to his desk. For a second, he hesitated, questioning his own authority; but he reassured himself that he was the only authority in Böhmen-Mähren. Daleuge began to draw a battle plan.\n\nAs the SS regiments marched out of Prag, they did so with discipline, but without spirit.

Not one of the futile untermenschen causes that have plagued the Reich, but a heroic German Resistance. A resistance of heroes, relegated to the shadows. The Mähren-based resistance is led by one Rudolf Toussaint; a veteran of the First Great War who has since dutifully served his country during the Second World War, and this loyalty was unfazed by the succession of Führer Göring. He is the perfect candidate to lead our operations on the inside.\n\n"Herr Schörner. It is good to hear from you". Toussaint grimaced his peers in the room upon hearing the gravelly Bavarian accent on the other end of the line. Unsurprisingly. he found himself on the receiving end of a barrage of orders which his assistant hastily wrote down, whilst Toussaint could do nothing but agree. Eventually Schörner was done, and the call ended, without the resistance giving a single point of note back to the commander.\n\nThe room awoke in a calm, but passionate, debate. Toussaint's old guard emphasised caution in the face of Germany and wanted to toe Schörner's line, whilst the newer officers promoted after the fall of the garrison wanted to try and make contact with a general who would actually listen to the resistance. Nothing came of the debate. Everyone stuck to their positions, and Toussaint eventually dismissed the entire room. No good would ever come of divisions.\n\nQuietly sitting at his desk, Toussaint looked over his plans, then over Schörner's plans. Not much use in his own plans now. If he worked against Schörner's orders he would certainly be shot for treason as soon as the army caught up with him. But he was loyal to Germany no matter who that meant answering to. "

The soldier's anger was extinguished, and his sternness disappeared as he slumped back over the bed, dead.\n\nSlinging his rifle over his shoulder, Rudolf surveyed the barracks. About twenty beds. Besides each of them, a small drawer, presumably the only possessions the SS soldiers owned. A swastika on one end of the room, and the Black Sun on the other. No windows. There had to be something of worth in here, since there was nothing in the rest of the village; surely the SS couldn't have sent it all back to Prag?\n\nFor the next hour, he searched every drawer and found little. A few pictures; siblings? Loved ones? Could the SS even feel love anymore? He found one pocket watch, presumably an heirloom. Might as well keep that one, he supposed. There were a few books, mostly filled with the ravings of that lunatic Himmler. Rudolf put them to one side, so it would be easier to burn them later. These men lived with next to nothing; no cards, no memories of home, just their uniforms and their hatred. He was beginning to feel frustrated by the time he reached the last drawer, before tugging it and realising it was locked. A grin spread over his face as he took the butt of his rifle and slammed it into the drawer, which promptly burst open.\n\nInside the drawer was a wealth of jewellery, gold, gemstones, rings, every precious thing that man could create.

Petty despots like Daleuge would scatter before him as he swept through Europe, crushing all those who dared resist his might.\n\n'Herr Schörner'. His assistant's voice was firm. Schörner was always sure to pick out assistants that wouldn't fear him; fear was inevitably followed by incompetence. 'We've had a series of reports about SS partisans who refuse to give up the fight. Our divisions across Böhmen-Mähren are waiting for orders. Should we hunt them down?'\n\nThe wind on the balcony picked up slightly, rippling through the swastika that now hung above the headquarters. Schörner's face did not stir. Finally, he spoke.\n\n'Hunt them to the last man. Spare no one. Keep three of our divisions stationed here, assisting the garrison. Delegate them to another commander.' A slight trace of a smile crept over Schörner's face; it wouldn't be perceptible to most, but this was a significant display of emotion for the orthodox general. 'The rest of the divisions will leave the day after tomorrow, along with ourselves. We're moving onto the next target.' Schörner hesitated. 'If they find Daleuge, tell me. I'd like to see him.

An untermenschen under the Reich? That would be a stain that cannot be wiped from our nation! The reaction from the hardcore militarists are one and the same. We cannot trust him, and the only way we should be even considering dealing with Vituska is with a bullet! With the new focus of the Reich being conquest to make us great again, it seems as though this would be in keeping with the policy we promised Germany.\n\nBut another band of less hardline officers has suggested the unthinkable; accept the proposal, undermine Vituska's authority, then eventually integrate Ostland again. While this seems a wild breach of the militarist belief that won us the civil war, there is an element of reason in their plan; we can spare Ostland from a second wave of destruction that would no doubt leave the colony far behind the rest of the Reich in industrial strength and Germanisation.\n\nThe final decision rests on the shoulders of the Führer.

But Herr Schörner is beginning to believe he holds the keys to the Reich. If we were to reduce his officers to mere diplomats to Vituska's regime, it would reduce his power in the metropole and send a message that the Führer still holds the reins. Schörner himself does not seem shaken by rumours of this proposal; perhaps he has finally learned his place!\n\nAlternatively, we could simply send neutral officers to take part in the exchange. Vituska would possibly hand over better information if this were the case, as it certainly helps to negotiate with men who aren't openly calling for your blood; but Vituska is utterly unpredictable, so who can say what he truly wants. This would leave more power in the hands of the militarists, but isn't that what we fought for?"

If we sent his desperately under equipped forces weapons then we may be able to achieve true lasting stability in Ostland and root out the partisans once and for all.\n\nOf course, it isn't that simple. If we were to send Vituska as many arms as we can spare, his forces would likely be more effective and could even defend themselves against threats from Moskowien; it would also help build Vituska's trust for us. However, this is putting our arms in the hands of a dangerously unpredictable man, and perhaps it would be best if we only send enough arms to put down the partisan menace, not enough to defy our will."

Invasion was a no brainer- it had always been the plan to integrate Ostland into the Reich one day- but it pained Göring to need to waste German lives on a territory that was once an easy landgrab. He needed to make it easier- the less lives lost, the better.\n\nAn idea came to mind. Certainly not all Germans in Ostland were fans of Jeckeln's maniacal regime. After all, were they not just fighting him? They may not have much in common, but something that could generally unite Germans of all walks of life was their distaste for the SS. Certainly, Göring and his men could find some veterans brave enough to rally themselves for the return of order and the purge of the madness that the SS brought.\n\nThe idea crystallized in his head, and Göring smiled. Remer and his men would infiltrate the Ostland border, searching for militarist contacts. Once there, they would form their own units, ready to sew chaos behind enemy lines. These infiltrations would not only make the war a thousand times more manageable, but would shorten it drastically.

Should he ever turn against us, there is no doubt we can put him down. Along with undermining Vituska, the exchange has also been successful in cutting down militarist power,with Schörner's hardline influence notably diminished.\n\nDespite the success of our plan in undermining them both, neither Schörner nor Vituska seem to see through our plot. In fact, they are both enthusiastic about continuing the exchange, and Vituska has sent a request to keep Schörner's officers remaining in Ostland longer to supervise a new training program. This arrangement benefits us the most; but the wholehearted embracing of our plan by the people it should impact the worst has aroused suspicion amongst a few in the government."

Despite the fact we appeased them by sending neutral officers, Schörner's militarists are protesting the recall and stating that they could've retrieved more vital information and made Vituska even more vulnerable.

Whatever we thought, we were wrong. Today Schörner's officers launched a coup in Ostland, attempting to seize power from Vituska and hand it over to the hardline militarists.\n\nPerhaps it was fortunate for us that Vituska was already a few steps ahead. He was able to put down the coup with remarkable efficiency, and now all the officers we sent are dead.

As the general, now visibly incensed at being contradicted by his superior, opens his mouth to reply, the Führer closes the discussion: "Von Krosigk has always been a loyal servant of the Reich. By proclaiming his neutrality he has saved the Bohemian industrial core from being captured by the degenerate SS, don't you agree?"\n\n"Yes, but-"\n\n"Then, if you understand, there is no need for an invasion.

Göring's voice was almost nostalgic, "you were still Finanzminister, weren't you?"\n\n"It must have been at least ten years, before I became Reichsprotektor" von Krosigk had the same tinge in his tone, thinking about different times, when political enemies were still that, and didn't try to have you shot for treason, or begin a civil war.\n\n"Indeed! How much time has passed, my friend... things have been tough, though I'm sure you too had your own enemies to fight in Bohemia... pesky SS, always trying to snivel their way in. You have been extremely competent, just as you have always been, a great resource for our even greater Reich!"\n\nHis guest nods politely, part sincere and part calculating, as he has learned to be. He knows, however, that reminiscing isn't the only reason for his presence at Carinhall, and he isn't disappointed.\n\n"This is why, despite Schörner's opinions, I've decided that you'll be appointed gauleiter when Bohemia is reintegrated into the Vaterland"\n\nOf course. That was the reason for the invitation: von Krosigk has known, ever since the end of the civil war, that the Bohemian industries would be highly coveted by the resurgent Reich.

Simple diplomacy.\n\nAn lone, inconspicuous black car pulled out the airfield carrying the most powerful man in Ostland. As he looked out onto the wheat fields he thought about the exchange. Perhaps he could've gotten more out of it. Vituska tended to find opportunity simply presented itself to a man, and nothing about the exchange has given him true opportunity.

Accordingly, the aggressive pursuit of Germanization can slow down to a more measured pace. The Führer's reasoning is simple: with their will to fight repeatedly broken and a strong German presence established, the natives pose no threat at this point and their assimilation or displacement is so certain that the Reich can finally afford to ease up, redirecting resources to more pressing matters. The integration of the remaining parts of Ostland, be they majority-German or native, is to commence immediately and without hesitation. Our race will win out in these areas soon enough."

A fair number have been brought on-side while nobody was watching following the civil war, but perhaps it's worth attempting to secure the loyalty of a few more.

Though the media has no inkling of where the money came from, the people who leaked it - namely, a number of Schörner's underlings who apparently caught wind of the Führer's attempts to buy Drechsler's men - the Wehrmacht undoubtedly does. Gestapo surveillance personnel have reported that the Reichskommissar and Field Marshal met this morning, likely to discuss a punitive response to Göring's failed attempt at turning their men against them.\n\nGöring's blunder has deeply impacted his standing with his powerful allies. This minor incident might not come to much, but it has revealed the Führer's vulnerability and lack of political acumen.

This, your Führer is more than aware of. However, he is also certain that anyone reading this memorandum is equally aware of the reasons behind the decision to invade and depose the pretender Reichskommissar. It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Otto-Heinrich Drechsler was corrupt and in the employ of the same nefarious forces who reduced Ostland to a state of civil war. The fact that this man was a long-serving member of our great establishment does not excuse his betrayal of the Reich and the German race. Loyalty and trust is measured by one's dedication to the Führer and the willingness to obey unquestioningly. That Drechsler refused the Führer's direct order to stand down from his unlawfully claimed post should be reason enough for all to join in condemnation of his actions and purge his memory from the rolls of the NSDAP.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that nobody expected treason from such a widely-known and well-respected man - an ex-Gauleiter and veteran of the Sturmabteilung, no less. The Führer recognises the reality of Drechsler's popularity and wishes to ameliorate your concerns by assuring each and every one of you that he acted only out of necessity, not for any petty political gain. The Führer is above such temptations and has only the greater good of the Reich in mind when acting in his capacity as father to the nation. It is his sincerest wish that harmony and concord should reign amongst the armed forces - a wish that we can all work together to fulfil now that the dark days of civil conflict are past.\n\nHeil Göring!"

goering.921.t:0 "The Stahlecker Issue"
goering.921.desc:0 ""You haven't met Stahlecker, have you?" The question was muffled, with Erich, Göring's secretary, rummaging through a filing cabinet for the celebratory brandy. "The man's a dyed-in-the-wool National Socialist, loyal as they come." Göring didn't respond. He simply sat and stared ahead with hands folded, clearly lost in thought and oblivious to the one-sided conversation taking place. "I'm sure you wouldn't get along with him," Erich continued, "But that wouldn't matter. If you told him to jump off a cliff, he'd do it solely out of respect for your office."\n\nAfter a minute more of awkward silence, Erich returned to Göring's desk, grinning and holding up the 25-year-old brandy that the Führer had pocketed during a visit to Paris in 1940. Göring didn't seem to notice, continuing to stare past his secretary even as the bright-eyed young clerk poured out a glass for his boss. "My Führer?" he asked, noticing Göring's blank expression.\n\n"Hmm? Oh, thank you, Erich," Göring muttered, closing his worn fingers around the cool, hard glass. "No... no, I haven't met Stahlecker. He was an SS man during the war, so I never had the pleasure." A twinge of worry shot across his face, and he raised the glass to down his drink in a single go, savouring the memories of less complicated times that it brought up. Minutes passed, during which Erich could only stand in place, awkwardly fiddling with the bottle's cap. "Give me another, boy," he finally grunted. "The Field Marshal is coming to dispense some 'advice' soon. Let's make sure we're properly fortified for it, eh?""

Stahlecker, ever the loyalist, had accepted his offer to negotiate and allow aid into Ostland. The Führer's feelings - and the subsequent celebratory drinking - are mirrored throughout the Reich. The state media, still a muddled mess after the civil war, had been pushing contradictory headlines regarding the Ostland situation for weeks, but by the afternoon of the day in which the Führer put out a statement to the press, every paper, TV news show and radio broadcast delivered the same message: No More Civil War.\n\nHowever, far from the temporary warmth and peace to be found in Carinhall that night, OKW headquarters seethes with treasonous spite. Peace? Peace, with the great Otto-Heinrich Drechsler murdered and Ostland in the feeble grip of a Bormannite? Peace, with a man who would rather laze about and lord over idle subhumans? Peace, with a man who was by all accounts a coward, a traitor and an indolent old conservative?\n\nNot on the Field Marshal's watch."

There would, many realised, be a lot more shouting later in the day if that outburst was any indication.\n\nHours later, Field Marshal Schörner downed the phone, hooked directly to the Chancellery, with a satisfied smile. He had known, of course, about Göring's peaceful overtures towards Stahlecker. For a time, he had been concerned - it was an open secret that Göring had no interest in so-called 'pointless' wars or anything beyond enriching himself and enjoying the perks of his office. This, however, was the first step towards changing that. It would take some time, yes - but if he were to be pulled deep enough into the Field Marshal's machinations, he would soon find himself too bogged down to even think about defying the will of the armed forces again. Then, and only then, would the Reich's invincibility be ensured."

The few brave enough to attempt to eavesdrop in the thirty seconds that the men spent with the Führer heard no exchange of words; no indignant shouts or threats of arrest, nor snide, practiced military snobbery. When the officers left, the only apparent change was the absence of an envelope, stamped with the mark of OKW, that had previously been carried in a worn and scarred hand.\n\nGöring had been expecting such an outrageous move in response to his decision to pursue peace with Stahlecker, however. There had been no exchange of words for precisely that reason; the Panzergrenadiers had their orders, and Göring had been informed of their arrival hours in advance. With all the pieces so clearly laid out, there was no need for words - only a silent understanding.\n\nThe letter was clear in its wording. Cold, uncaring and professional - straight from the desk of Field Marshal Schörner. "Army High Command," it read, "Is deeply concerned by recent decisions made by the Führer. As the unquestionable defenders of the Greater Germanic Reich, we wish to express our hesitance to endorse the Führer's refusal to employ a practical solution to the renegade colony of Ostland. We recommend the immediate issue of an ultimatum demanding total submission and compliance to the self-proclaimed authority therein, under threat of military intervention. We expect that the Führer will wholeheartedly endorse this measure and carry it out post-haste.\n\nSieg heil!"

Any action taken against Ostland, military or otherwise, will now be legally justified and much more palatable to the Reich's citizens. Now, Göring is under pressure not just from OKW, but from many civilians in his administration and cabinet. A self-proclaimed Reichskommissar has refused his orders and set his men on a belligerent stance against us - how can we possibly react with anything but swift and bloody retribution?\n\nWith rather pointed words, apparently. So claims Göring, at least. Still set on avoiding bloodshed despite Stahlecker's insult, the Führer has expressed his belief that the renegade can be brought to heel. His logic is sound, at least: Stahlecker, as a Bormannite, values Germanic unity above all else. The shedding of Aryan blood is anathema to him and it was a wonder that he even found the willpower to push through the Ostland civil war in the first place. Yet, deep down, he is no true soldier; he lacks a military awareness of war's realities. Demonstrate to him in no uncertain terms what war with the Reich would entail, and he will fold. The Führer has received a certain amount of support for this idea, even from elements of the Wehrmacht, but wonders aloud if it's worth the effort."

Concerns have been expressed by certain ill-educated economists that the demand for Ostland's economy to be placed in the hands of Germania's bureaucrats was a step too far and that it will have disastrous consequences for the colony, but the Führer is happy to be done with the whole messy affair. The Wehrmacht, too, has stated their gratitude to Stahlecker and the Führer for their admirable effort in overcoming ideological differences to ensure a better future for the Reich's favorite colony.\n\nAnd yet, there's a sense that we could have done better."

Would you risk spilling the blood of your friends and family members from the Fatherland? Would you truly put your life on the line for a civil servant who has overstepped his legal authority?\n\nThe Führer wishes for peace, but must enforce the unity of the Greater German Reich.

During breakfast, the Führer was interrupted by the arrival of a report from one of the staging grounds near the border with Ostland. Apparently, an entire Panzer battalion decided to conduct some 'reconnaissance' on their own initiative. They didn't report anything unusual upon returning to base, but one of our infantry patrols reported seeing smoke rising from a Lithuanian village just over the border. Recon aircraft quickly confirmed that the village of approximately 400 civilians had been razed to the ground, with no signs of life remaining besides some wandering cattle. This particular village had not previously been of any interest to us due to its lack of defenses - Schörner claims provocation by partisans and the Ostland garrison, however, stating that his men were defending themselves.\n\nThe Führer is outraged by this impropriety, but that may well have been the intended result. There is little publicly available evidence of our forces' involvement in the attack, so certain elements of the militarist cabinet are urging him to turn the incident into a propaganda offensive to aid a coup against Stahlecker which is currently in the works (which is the first that the Führer has heard of such a thing). The Führer, for his part, would rather just pretend the incident didn't happen at all, to avoid any disruption to his war of words with Stahlecker - he is certain that his plan will still bear fruit.\n\nThe army, however, makes no secret of the fact that they bear responsibility, and is pushing for the Führer to authorize a second raid to undermine Stahlecker further. Why Schörner would advocate for two different solutions at the same time is anyone's guess."

Our pilots fought bravely and with great skill, but were outnumbered by ten to two. A loss was inevitable, with Lieutenant Wilhelm Kurtz being shot down over hostile territory. Thankfully his wingman made it back to base, but the damage is done. Even as the Luftwaffe mourns this loss, their allies in the Heer are baying for blood, now that there is proof of Stahlecker's hostile intentions.\n\nThe Führer is now under immense pressure to issue the invasion order, as continuing with attempts to intimidate Stahlecker will now infuriate the Luftwaffe as well as the Heer.

Those close to the Führer's office were able to catch enough specific words that by evening, rumors were rife throughout Germania: the Luftwaffe had destroyed one of their own aircraft in a false-flag attack intended to smear Stahlecker. How the Führer learned of the plot is unknown, but the assumption is that Stahlecker himself was involved.\n\nYet there has been no move on the Führer's part, nor a counterattack by the militarists. The officers were permitted to leave the building, thoroughly shaken but unharmed. Whatever they said to the Führer, it was enough to give him momentary pause. Could it be that he has resolved not to take action against the plotters, despite their gross insubordination and betrayal of one of their own? Or is he merely considering the options laid out before him?\n\nThe Führer alone knows the true stakes of his situation. The militarists are dangerous, yes, but their most recent plot may have gone too far even for their ambition. Should action be taken against the plotters using the Abwehr, there are unlikely to be serious consequences, and Stahlecker has proven that he acts in good faith and is deserving of fair treatment.

Stahlecker has promised that mutual recognition of legitimacy is all he ever sought, and that he will serve the Reich "...faithfully, for life, and unto death." For his part, the Führer had this to say:\n\n"We live in trying times. Loyalties are constantly put to the test in unexpected ways, as are one's commitments to one's ideals. The recent disagreements between the Reich and her colony are the result of unfortunate circumstances and the realities of the day. It is tragic that loss of life occurred as a consequence, but with this agreement a great deal more bloodshed has been avoided.

Piles of weapons, vacated bunkers and abandoned motor pools line every highway and no small number of garrison troops have simply vanished into the woods, either heading for home or abandoning their cause altogether. Their fate makes no difference now.\n\nStahlecker and his staff are now heading by plane for Germania, no longer employees of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Indeed, the Reichskommissariat no longer exists as of this moment; now formally dissolved as a separate entity, all Aryan Ostlanders are now full citizens of the Reich and the colony's treasury has been snatched up by the Führer's financiers. A number of economists have expressed concern at this seizure of the colony, claiming that it is 'unprepared for integration'.

After weeks of dragging his heels, Göring has achieved little more than lose the respect of conservatives for treating Stahlecker so harshly and infuriate the Wehrmacht with his preference for words over action. The invasion can no longer be stopped, despite Göring's best efforts. Any order to hold fast would likely fall on deaf ears, as Schörner is past tolerating attempts at 'peace' and 'unity' for the time being.\n\nWar returns to Ostland; it will be swift, brutal and merciless. Anyone who knows the lay of the land and the disposition of the Wehrmacht could accurately predict that tens of thousands are likely to die, innocent or otherwise.

While no doubt amusing to the rank and file, he has a surprising amount of sway; not over Stahlecker, who remains as stoic as ever, but over the people of Ostland. The last thing we want in the event of successful negotiations is for the Ostlanders to rise up against our rule and render the whole peace process completely moot.\n\nThe Abwehr has pointed out that with the chaotic situation in Ostland, it would be child's play to remove this obnoxious individual from the equation. Even better, we have a man in Riga - a survivor of Drechsler's cabinet - who has spent the past few months schmoozing with his former enemies, who are unaware of his past loyalties.

Of course, it was apparently too little too late for the Wehrmacht, who have once again called for an invasion of Ostland. They refer to the man's anti-militarist rhetoric as 'subversive, disrespectful and indicative of the general company that Stahlecker keeps'.\n\nThe prospect of invading over insults - especially when the one responsible has been fired! - is obviously ridiculous to any level-headed individual, but the Wehrmacht is rarely a bastion of balanced, rational thought these days.

The same is true for the entirety of Ostland - everywhere, the garrison and Orpo are back on their routine patrols (though with fresh faces among them), farmers tend their crops and factories begin to churn out goods for sale back in the Reich. Even the non-Aryan natives seem mildly appreciative of the situation; they might be on the fringes of society, but at least they aren't being shot at by the SS or murdered by partisans for not being anti-German enough.\n\nIn his office, refurbished with new furniture from Germania befitting his now-official status, Stahlecker allowed himself to recline with a satisfied smile. This is what it was for - all the unpleasant things he did in the SS, the civil war, the tense negotiations with a Führer he had little in common with. This vision of peace and stability, so thoroughly devalued in recent years, made it all worthwhile.

He has apparently escaped any kind of discipline for this.\n\nThe Führer's response to this story was little more than a world-weary sigh.

This is by far one of the most confounding letters to ever cross Göring's desk- if we thought that nations like Poland had no chance, a nation as small and weak as Slovakia will fall within a matter of days to the German war machine.\n\nIn any case, such a response, though unexpected, was planned for. A Heer army lines the border, waiting on our word to invade and crush these rebellious upstarts for good. With the comical difference in size, training, and equipment between our army and theirs, this operation should take no longer than a week to complete. Before long, German boots will march through Bratislava, and Slovakia will learn its place- as our inferiors, nothing more."

It made no sense- decades of subservience, quiet obedience, and then suddenly they had jumped ship from Germany as fast as they could. All the way up to the Burgerkrieg, the few reports that ever came from Slovakia were mundane- peaceful, quiet, boring reports nobody gave much mind to. Why would they?\n\nIt struck Göring like a lightning bolt. The reports were so incredibly wrong because the Slovakians had been hiding their intentions. While they had paid lip service to the Reich, they had been secretly planning their betrayal for years! It all fell into place- the sudden change in heart, the resistance to German control, all of it. As Göring figured it out, the plan began to fall into place.\n\nThe collaborationist government would be restored, as expected, but they would never again get so much autonomy. The Reich had taken its eye off the ball, and Slovakia had exploited it to the fullest. Now, the Reich's eyes would be glued to Slovakia, and the army would be ready to sweep in the instant a single piece of the puzzle tried to fall out of place.

Slowly, however, the sense of dread was replaced with confusion as Hermann continued to dance around the point, asking questions about his combat record, his experience, his education- it began to dawn on Foertsch that this may not be a punishment, but a job interview.\n\n"Well, Foertsch, I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you in here." Göring said, taking a drink from his glass. Foertsch silently nodded. "You know of our recent operation in Slovakia, yes? It's clear to me that the Slovaks are still too untrustworthy to entrust with running their own country. After all, that's what we did for years, and they split from us the first chance they got. I'm planning on setting up a new Reichskommissariat there, and you seem like a good man for the job."\n\nFoertsch sat silently. This was not what he expected.

It wasn't like they were any real threat to the Reich, but this festering sore on Germany's underside was taking a hundred German lives a month. What was wrong with the Slovaks? When God made them, clearly he had forgotten to put in the quit.\n\nThere was an easy way to solve this, of course- expanding ORPO operations to the Slovakian region. After all, could local forces be trusted with occupying their own nation? No, such an arrangement was begging for disaster.

The people quickly learned to fear them, and soon the streets were quiet- no more demonstrations or furious speeches, only the sounds of cars and footsteps, all watched over by the Germans.\n\nThe people hated the Waffen-HG, but what could they do about it? They had been disarmed, destroyed, and overwhelmingly crushed by a monster far, far greater than any of them. Even if, by some miracle, they succeeded in expelling the German beast, they'd just come back with their tanks again, and this time Slovakia would never get another chance.\n\nSo the Slovakian people, by and large, gave up.

Surely you would know him by reputation, at least; the man is famously infatuated with the subhumans of eastern Europe in a manner that goes beyond mere academic fascination. His loyalty has been suspect for years, but the Gestapo were never able to find conclusive evidence to bring charges of treason against him. It is likely that his significant personal fortune was the means by which he evaded the law - were we to conduct a thorough investigation, we would likely turn up many a Gestapo officer with greasy palms.\n\nMeyer-Landrut is no military man, but his betrayal of Aryan ideals has wooed many Balts and Slavs, who now fight for him along with our traitor kin. More significantly, of course, he represents a serious ideological threat as the last holdout of Speerism. My Führer, it is this agency's concern that as long as this traitor to the Fatherland and National Socialism remains active, the legitimacy of the Reich is threatened. It is Field Marshal Schörner's view that immediate action against this final pocket of resistance within the Reich proper is necessary, before the poison of liberalism finds root within our society again."

Often accompanied by their staff - no doubt indoctrinated into obedience - many were caught and arrested in their own homes or officers, desperately burning one document after another to try and protect themselves.\n\nWith the owners of some of Germany's biggest banks and businesses apprehended, it was a simple matter to rubber-stamp the paperwork necessary to seize their assets and transfer them to the Führer's personal control. The agents who brought in the snakes each received a commendation and a hefty bonus, cut from the wealth of their quarries.

Shortly after the news broke in the morning papers, the Wehrmacht's press office released a statement confirming that two squads of Pioneers from the 44th Grenadier Division stormed the empty factory at approximately 5:00 AM with orders to carry out the demolition of the entire structure. The factory was, according to 'reliable sources', being used as a hideout for a large SS cell. More importantly, it allegedly produced weapons for the traitors, with the entire workforce being implicated by the Wehrmacht's informants. Accordingly, the Pioneer units placed demolition charges around the factory in the hours before the first workers arrived, only detonating them once a majority of the workforce was confirmed to be on the clock. An attempt to dig for survivors in the rubble was repelled by the timely arrival of a large Feldgendarmerie contingent, who sealed off the site and declared that more Pioneers would soon be arriving to apply further explosives in order to 'collapse any subterranean construction'.\n\n"I don't understand," said a passing civilian when asked for comment. "That place was a brick factory. There aren't even any armaments factories in the whole of Riga. I've worked in both kinds of factories and I can tell you that there's no confusing brick-making equipment for gunsmithing tools."

"Your boy got back to you quickly, didn't he?" Despite their differing cultures, Dietrich and his family had been accepted with relative warmth. So far out from the major centres of civilisation and its tracts of arable land, there had been little objection to a lone colonial family moving into an abandoned woodland home. Someone had to keep the deer in check, after all.\n\n"He did." Dietrich motioned to the blasted tangle of steel and wood half-buried in the mud right in the middle of the road, where there had previously been a minor railway running through the forest. "He couldn't say what it was you wanted me to see, but it certainly speaks for itself."\n\n"Yes. I wondered, given your time in service, if you would know how this happened?" There was a pause as the German scratched at the graying stubble on his chin and went rummaging through memories of 20 years prior. Given the thoroughly wrecked state of the rails and three-foot-deep crater, it could only have been done with military-grade demolition charges.\n\n"Small but strong railbusting charges," he finally said. "Only Pioneer units are equipped with those. The soldiers who passed through yesterday must have been scouting for vulnerable points in the railway like this crossing."

His eyes were shrouded in shadow by the pillar of flame, and its wicked light glimmered on the brass buttons of the other soldiers as they turned to look at Armin.

The militarists have openly accused the Wolgastaat of traitors, claiming that the "Two State Solution" had twisted their minds and turned them into enemies of our national socialist cause, and they must be totally purged as a righteous punishment. Others who are more moderate than those radicals also believe that a military invasion is necessary to reclaimed our eastern lands and reunite the German nation under the third Reich.

We have yet to reach them, but they are strong enough that they will pose a threat once fully manned. Currently however, they are vulnerable, with most Swiss forces on the front lines. The newly proposed plan would have us sabotage these forts, rendering them useless before the Swiss have a chance to cower inside them.\n\nA small debate has emerged over how we should sabotage the forts. The Wehrmacht wants to use their special forces in a land operation, as has been done before, but the Luftwaffe are pushing for the use of their paratrooper divisions in an aerial manoeuvre. Both would likely be effective, but it is up to us to decide which forces we should utilise."

But some generals hold different opinion, saying the Bosnian nationalists will be quickly wiped out if they just declare a rebellion, and they can cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian government if they can keep underground and do some sabotage works. Regardless of which option our order will be, the Bosnian resistance organization is eagerly waiting for it, and we have to make our decision as soon as possible."

goering.1091.desc:0 "The Yugoslav Army in the Homeland, commonly known as the Chetniks, share a complex history with us. Originally a Yugoslavian resistance movement, their attitude towards us is always changing according to the Balkans international relations. And in recent days the situation in Yugoslavia has changed rapidly as the Croatian communists had seized power and incorporated the Serbian lands into their territories, which makes an alliance between us become possible once again. As a result, a meeting is arranged to discuss the details about the cooperation between us.\n\nThe beginning the negotiation was not easy. The Chetniks speak aggressively, claiming that they'll agree on nothing if we don't help them restore a totally independent Kingdom of Yugoslavia ruled by Serbs and provide them assistance much more than what we can accept. However, our delegates pointed it out that the entire Serbian land is dominated by the communists now and they don't stand a chance on their own. Finally, they had to admit that we are the only forces that can help them fulfill their dream and agreed on our terms, as long as we grant their restoration after the war.\n\nNow, it is time for us to decide whether should we keep words about assistance. It is true that providing them what they need and allow them have their monarchy will make them appreciated and loyal to us. But some suggest that what we need is only to have them distract the communist government, and since the Chetniks cannot even drive the commies out from their own land, they don't really deserve to have a role in our Balkan post-war order. And no matter what our decision may be, we need to make it quickly now."

Since we are also in need of someone who can help us launch our invasion against Yugoslavia, the old friendship seems to be about to be rekindled.\n\nOur terms are very simple: they take orders from us and do what we command, in exchange for our military intervention in the Yugoslavian politics. Because the communists are hunting them down at any cost, they currently have no other choices but to entrust their fate to us. Therefore, they easily accept our proposal, saying that they're more than honored to get the second chance to work with the Reich. At the end of our meeting, they told us that they had already organized some political dissents and ready to take our orders.\n\nNow, as we've successfully made connection with them, it's time for us to decide which role they will play in our invasion plan. The first choice is to let them organize a national uprising, which will greatly reduce the resistance on the front. However, we can also let them do some underground activities and sabotages.

Evidently after safely identifying each other, the men began to speak to one another. Neither worried of any potential eavesdroppers- they were the only men out on such an ugly night.\n\n"So. Directly here on the Führer's orders, hmm? What does he want out of us?" The Norwegian quietly asked. Hans could not discern whether his shiver came from any fear or if it was just a byproduct of the wild conditions.\n\n"He has two proposals for you, with the belief that you have the resources to do one of them."Hans replied.\n\n"Let me hear them."\n\n"The first is the simpler one. We give you some arms, some explosives, a manual or two, and you do with them what you see fit. Perhaps a factory suddenly finds its main machinery rooms a detonated mess, perhaps a railroad finds itself explosively cut." Hans judged the reaction on the native's face, and was rather disappointed to find none of any real note.\n\n"The second is a bit more subtle. We give you some designs, some ideas, and a lot of paper. You make the magic happen, maybe convince the people that we Germans aren't so bad, and our lives get a lot easier.

The man in the truck could not read what they were saying, but he knew what it was- poster after poster, detailing the benefits of restoring the German Reichskommissariat.\n\nFinally, the two men returned, their hands empty. As the driver flicked his headlights on and began to drive away, the light flashed off the multitudes of posters plastered on every building.

The people tomorrow would wake up to a city covered in pro-german propaganda, and they would know that their salvation would be at hand.\n\nOr at least, they would have, had the truck made it to its intended destination.\n\nUnfortunately, the police had been tipped off beforehand of hardliner activity in this particular area, and as such had prepared themselves for it. The truck rounded a corner, only to find its path forward blocked by a squad car. Before it could react, another squad car sped out behind it, blocking its path. Even as the driver cursed his luck, police stormed forward, dragging all three men from the vehicle and slapping cuffs around their wrists.

In the chaos, nobody would have noticed just another suddenly missing man from the rosters. But he stayed with the division he had based his career around, all the way up to when they needed a driver for a mission in the north, on a promise from the Führer himself. But there was no time left for regrets now.\n\nEven while upside down and with a swollen eye, the driver could make out a small group of partisans carrying away the equipment the Germans had graciously given to them. His eyes wandered over to the partisan crouching next to the truck, rifle in hand and pointed directly at the driver's head.\n\nThere was only enough time for the driver to let out a sigh of regret before the crack of a gunshot cut the air, and regrets that the driver had held for years disappeared in a flash."

Coming in by helicopter undetected the members of the Gestapo's special unit disembarked and proceeded on foot, all the while believing they still had the element of surprise. It was only when they entered into the supposedly empty depot that they realized how badly they had been mistaken.\n\nSchörner's men had been waiting for them, and a brief but fierce firefight ensued that left several of our men dead and over half wounded. Schörner's men were considerably better off, although their exact casualties are unknown. Of course Schörner denied ordering his men to fire on ours, claiming they had believed it was a partisan raid and only retaliated in believed self-defense. An obvious lie, but one we are forced to play along with lest we escalate things to a breaking point before we are ready. Unfortunately this means that the chemicals remain in Schörner's maniacal clutches for the time being."

The deadly poison came from neither party, but from a third group, enemy to both, that had sat watching as its terrible weapon made short work of both rivals.\n\nThe Wehrmacht men quickly expiring were not just any soldiers of the Reich, but were, to the man, members of cliques loyal to Führer Hermann Göring. They had been sent, deliberately into battle based on this association, and had died for it. The man who ordered this attack was none other than the Generalfeldmarschall of the OKW, Ferdinand Schörner himself. He had apparently decided to rid himself of both his professional rivals and his targets in the Swiss Alps with one fell strike.

Hundreds of bodies coat the cold ground, and as their empty eyes stare into the smoking horizon the only sight that looks back at them are the shocked survivors, themselves being rounded up by Heer reinforcements.\n\nWith the first strategic objective secured, we stand able to make ready for the total seizure of Onega. Enemy battalions at the periphery were able to withdraw beyond our operational range and regroup with what remains of their armed forces, though it will not help them. Now that they well and truly know that we are coming for them, they have no defense outside the calculus of war.

Debriefing - or interrogation - of surviving infantrymen describes a military folly of a magnitude painful to even consider. Enemy grenadiers and saboteurs disabled or destroyed dozens of vehicles, to say nothing of the now-smoking corpses inside of them, and were obscured from retaliatory airstrikes by trees and terrain. Further, past Luftwaffe bombings destroyed all roads and ingresses to vital areas, and intelligence did not consider this when creating the tactical plans causing entire armored columns to become stuck and having to abandon their vehicles for fear of enemy capture. The vehicles could not be secured by their leaving crews, so one officer ordered a bombing run on the valley to deny their use to the Russians, but poor communication resulted in targeting a separate - occupied - convoy instead.\n\nThe shame of being defeated at the hands of an untrained, ill-equipped, degenerate enemy in a backwater unlisted on maps is too much to bear.

As many troops as we could spare were thrown into defensive positions on the perimeter, and as the sun rose low in the east the battle began in earnest. They expected a force a quarter of our size, and our immediate counter-offensive hamstrung them only a few kilometers deep into our territory. Once met in earnest, the fighting was beyond brutal.

And the worst part is, most of them just went to the Russian States and joined our enemies' side with all equipment and information they hold. In one word, we screwed everything up.\n\nBut the Führer understands that there is not enough time for him to regret. He must find a proper solution for current situation as soon as possible. Those who defected to the Russians are just some officers,and the left soldiers are still in our sides, waiting for our more orders. And more importantly, the war is still going on, and if we can win this war in the end, no one will remember some defecting officers, right?\n\n"

 goering.1223.desc:0 "Once again, the Führer found himself in the unenviable position of hearing out the demands of Ferdinand Schörner. A great map of Russia lay on the table, dug out from the archives all the way back from Operation Barbarossa for the purposes of illustrating some point. The map was of course hopelessly outdated, but Göring thought he could see the direction the conversation was being steered.\n\n"-and the conclusion of the whole operation, uncompleted until now, the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line, to complete the separation of Russia from Europe and ensure Germany has enough Lebensraum for centuries to come."\n\n"And let me guess, you want to refortify the A-A Line." Göring maintained a neutral expression, lacing his fingers together." He tried to quantify the manpower and resources required to finish the project but gave up rapidly. Schörner was unfazed by his plan's predictability, and ploughed on.\n\n"Indeed, my Führer, the plan is self-evident in it's value. Had we completed the fortifications rather than resting on our laurels prematurely, the Soviets would never have been able to regroup and push us back, and Himmler's failed coup would have never even begun. Late as we are, completing the line is the only way to ensure the Russians never have a chance to retake Moskow."\n\nThe Führer thought that Schörner's concern had little to do with the ideology or national security, and much more to do with the influence he would gain with the troops on the eastern frontier. The line may have some strategic value, but it would likely be outweighed by the colossal cost of building a wall across a whole continent. Not to mention the cost of refusal - he could see the spiteful look in Schörner's eye even on the best of days, and had no desire to annoy him further."

If he seriously thinks this wall is a good investment, he's even stupider than I thought." Stuckart's folder flopped to his side, limply.\n\n"He is nothing of the sort, and you would be a fool to let him hear you say that." Göring's glance turned into a glare. Stuckart held up his hands in resignation.\n\n"All I am saying is, we could stand to save a great deal on materials. Do we really need to waste high quality concrete and steel on a wall the Russians will never reach? We could stand to dilute what Schörner's boys get, they'll never be in a position to notice the difference."\n\nPerhaps Stuckart did have a point - while Schörner himself would almost certainly make note of the change in the supply situation, and he'd have to have that conversation with the bastard, the chances of the Russians pulling together enough to pose a true threat to the A-A Line, pure concrete or aggregated, were miniscule.

The icy Russian soil refused to give in easily - the constant movement of cart wheels and caterpillar tracks had churned up thick, wet mud, that over repeated cycles of freezing and thawing had created half a dozen layers of frozen ground that was closer to rock than dirt. A little extra strength would be appreciated, preferably that of a jackhammer or one of those excavators he'd seen on the back of the German trucks, but those were too valuable to be risked in the unskilled hands of a conscript such as himself.\n\nVadim allowed himself a brief moment to catch his breath and wipe the sweat from his brow, which had gathered there despite the cloud his breath produced in the cold. As he breathed, he surveyed the horizon. From his section of the would-be trench, half sunk into the earth, he could see but a small segment of the fortifications extent. He had never seen anything like it. He'd heard tales of distant China, where a great wall separated the civilised world from the barbarians to the north. This was the only comparison he could even consider relevant. For as far as the eye could see, and from what he'd heard a thousand times further and yet more, Russians like him laboured digging trenches, cutting down forests, draining swamps, hanging barbed wire, installing bunkers, fortifying choke points - building a wall the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\n"What's the holdup, Russkie?" His reverie was interrupted by a bark in German - outside the trench, the soldier supervising his group was looking down at him and idly playing with the action of his rifle.\n\n"Just catching my breath, sir," he replied in rudimentary German. Vadim swallowed as the soldier walked to the lip of the trench. Seeing his discomfort, the German chuckled and spat into the trench, narrowly missing Vadim.\n\n"Back to work. No unsanctioned breaks." Vadim nodded, relieved he had avoided a beating."

He and the other conscripts had been thrown a tarpaulin and were expected to make do - the dribble of rain pushing its way through the gaps in the sheeting draped over the squalid hole had turned the freshly excavated dirt straight back into mud, and most of his comrades had taken to sleeping upright to avoid drowning in mud, propped up by their tools. Well, it was mostly mud - the digging of latrines had been deemed a secondary priority compared to the main fortifications, and there were few Russians willing to leave the trench at night, when a trigger-happy German might take a simple toilet break for an escape attempt. If Vadim poked his head out from under their tarpaulin, he could see the corpse pile. He could smell it no matter where he was.\n\nThe Germans kept separate from the Russians in their tents, but Vadim had been able to overhear a few words while on duty - most of the soldiers assumed the Russians were incapable of understanding their language, despite the fact around half the conscripts were Muscovite, and many of the others had picked up smatterings of the trade language that had built up around what used to be the border between Moskowien and Russia. Despite the brutal punishments that were being dealt with increasing regularity to the "lazy" workers, work was apparently proceeding according to schedule. Once the work was done, Russia would be split in two, with a border not nearly so porous as that that preceded it. What would become of him then? Shipped out to another conflict, to dig holes and live in his own shit, or just disposed of, another face in the corpse pile? There must be some way out, some path between the sentries that would take him away. They wouldn't bother searching for him once he was out, he was all but worthless - that much was clear. But which way? Back west into Moskowien, and hope to remain unnoticed by the authorities? Or east into Russia, where who knows what awaited him? He'd heard the Soviet Union was restored far east, but then he'd also heard of bandits masquerading as Germans who would slaughter anyone they deemed too Russian.\n\nThe crack of a distant gunshot reached the trench, and a few of the others shifted in their sleep. Vadim's grip tightened around his mattock, and he dreamed of freedom."

For the first time in what felt like weeks, Vadim had been allowed a break, for there was no more work to do. He and his Russian comrades, for all their hard work, had been awarded respite, a chance to lean on their shovels and gaze at the miles of trenches they had dug by hand. Vadim could have done with one of the beers the soldiers were passing round, but for now he was just grateful to have good, clean water. The radio was blaring out some patriotic German song, immediately following a speech by Führer Göring congratulating the troops and labourers - the German labourers, of course - on the completion of what he referred to as "Eighth Wonder of the World", the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line.\n\nThe division of Germany and Russia was now a sharp line on the map rather than the blur it had once been, in what many other young Russians considered a small golden age of enterprise compared to the Union and Reich that sandwiched them. The only enterprise getting done these days certainly wasn't sending the profits his way. He sipped his water, for the moment content. His shoulders no longer ached. He surveyed the wilderness expanse to the east, nothing but fields as far as the eye could see - no cover. Nothing but easy shooting should some young asshole look up from his drinking and back to his duties. But still, there was no time left, they'd be moving out soon. The best thing he could see was a gully, a few hundred metres away leading southeast. If he could reach there in a couple of hours, when drinking and darkness had dulled their senses, he might be able to crawl out of sight.\n\nThe rumble of a truck interrupted his thoughts, and he turned. The truck was backing up to the trench, where his comrades were enjoying their rest. Soldiers, their rifles shouldered and looking much more sober than their drunken friends were accompanying it.\n\n"Russkies, in the truck! Next project." Vadim gazed into the back of the truck like it was a gaping pit. He was out of time."

For this reason - he notes - it might be advantageous to impose our authority completely on the remnants of the French Republic. With their armies almost nonexistent, and their governments weak, it would be a matter of hours to replace them with a German administration fully committed to the war effort.\n\nAnother general replies that Brittany is an important trade port, and removing its government, no matter how corrupt it is, would hit the German economy hard: while occupying France might be a good idea, Brittany is best left formally independent. Finally, a third suggests not to execute such a plan, and instead sign more favorable agreements with the two governments: fully occupying any of the two countries would only infuriate potential partisans, and force us to detach several garrisons, distracting our troops from the Iberian front.\n\nAs the High Command can't find an agreement, the decision falls to the Führer.

If we don't quickly find a solution terrorist will find fertile soil for new recruit, and we'll have to face a much more powerful enemy...\n\nSeveral among the Oberkommando have reacted harshly at the news. They request an immediate suppression of such shameful conduct, and the reinstatement of what they call "true Prussian discipline" in the Iberian garrisons: while the most sensible solution, this would also anger the local garrisons, whose pay is quite low already. A halfway solution would be limiting the looting to the Reichskommissariate of Portugal, Galizien and Andalusien: since they are much more controllable, it would be easier to repress any revolt there and keep the garrisons there happy.\n\nFinally, we could also refrain from taking any action, and let the looting continue.

Himmler has to know that some major power is responsible, but our involvement in sowing disarray is still unknown.\n\nThe Burgadian military is crippled after this latest wave of attacks.

Several of the men working leads on this operation have mysteriously gone missing; we only have one report of one of our men being kidnapped out of his house at night in Essen; we imagine the other dozen men have met similar fates and are likely dead already.

High ranking admirals are insisting that we need to either downsize our fleet or find new ports to dock our ships in.\n Neither option is at all enticing, as we are forced to either greatly reduce the Reich's power projection (essentially a non-option) or invade other countries to use their ports.

 goering.2000.desc:0 "Recently there has been whispers going around the ranks of the Kreigsmarine, a similar feeling to that felt during the mutinous days of the civil war. It is only a matter of time before these whispers turn into an outright rebellion, and something must be done. In order to ensure utmost stability and loyalty in these trying times, it has become paramount that we remove the traitors who conspire against us. While Schörner has influence in the navy he is not the only one, Hans Speidel has also managed to get some loyalists among the many admirals and while he is not outright hostile yet we cant exactly trust him. We must act quick if we are to maintain control of the navy.\n\nHowever, we must carefully choose who we are going to remove, as time is running thin and we cannot hope to antagonize the entirety of the Kriegsmarine. We must choose who to purge: the Speidelites or the Schörnerites."

It appears that by revealing our true colors, we have alienated certain members of the navy. Instead. They now proclaim their loyalty towards Schörner and his vile clique, a proposition which he has most graciously welcomed. The influence of the Schörnerites within the Kriegsmarine has grown increasingly worrisome as late, and we must act swiftly if we are to prevent a future mutiny."

 goering.2002.desc:0 "The sun slowly began to rise in the sky, as young men eagerly lined up in anticipation. Some whispered sly remarks to each other in order to help alleviate their nerves. Finally, these individuals would have the chance to dutifully serve their country. The line was moving steadily, and the men in charge quickly dispensed the required paperwork in an efficient and timely manner. There was an air of excitement around these men, feelings of excitement to better Germany and to serve their nations cause. This would be the start of something truly great for Germany.\n\nSuddenly, a bright light erupted across the barracks, as the deafening sounds of an explosion rocked those once excited men to the ground. Soon, the ground was engulfed in tendrils of flame and smoke, as agonizing groans could be heard amongst the wreckage. Men once radiating with excitement were now writhing in pain on the ground, covered in shrapnel and soot.\n\nReports across Germany have labelled the bombing on the Friekorps barracks as an act of terror towards the German people. Leaks of the Freikorp barracks whereabouts were apparently leaked by members of the navy, and many are suspecting that the raid was conducted by individuals seeking to undermine the authority of the Führer. Regardless of the political implications, the horrific events of today will not be soon forgotten by the German people."

Many officers of the Luftwaffe have gained hefty promotions during their service, and have been publicly commended for their great deeds defending the Fatherland. As a strong and proud nation, it is paramount to ensure that the heroic citizens of Germany get their just due. As such, transfer of several key positions within the Kriegsmarine to Luftwaffe officers was seen as a necessary and much needed course of action, in order to maintain order within the navy and to ensure the German war machine stayed well oiled. While there have been several objections to this decision within the navy itself, the Luftwaffe has gained a fierce sense of loyalty towards the Führer and his command."

In particular, specific individuals within the Luftwaffe have denounced Göring and the Friekorps, and have instead decided to take up arms with the growing Speidel clique. German high command has grown increasingly wary as of late, as Hans Speidel and his cronies have continuously gained momentum and support for their cause. Speidel and other political opponents have caused quite the stir amongst the German populace recently, as many have begun contemplating the legitimacy of Göring's position as Führer with powerful political opponents such as Speidel vying for control.\n\nDecisive action must be taken in order to avert a military takeover- or worse."

 goering.2005.t:0 "A Most Unique Opportunity"
 goering.2005.desc:0 "As political tensions continue to rise across much of the German Reich, Herr Göring and his associates have deemed it necessary to begin preparing for the inevitable, and have consequently begun fortifying numerous Luftwaffe bases across Germany in order to better ensure their future safety.\n\nInterestingly, the Führer's aides have recently approached him suggesting additional action be taken while fortifying these bases. According to special intelligence, areas of Germany heavily under the control of Speidel and Schörner have very limited air support loyal to them, and as such has provided us a unique opportunity to scout on our opposition. By using our aerial superiority to discover and locate the bases of the enemy, we would obtain a strategic advantage which would provide our Luftwaffe with a tactical advantage should any conflict break out within the Reich.\n\nThe plan, while sound, does come with a few flaws. If one of our scouting missions were to somehow be discovered by the enemy, it could potentially lead to an early unforeseen conflict and the loss of any strategic advantage we may have had. The decision is entirely in the hands of the Führer, as such a large decision should not be undertaken lightly."

The Führer and his officials have met this eagerness from the new guard with great enthusiasm, and have promised these men untold fortunes should they provide military support to the Führer in his time of need. While engaging in such activities may upset members of the old guard previously loyal to the Führer, it is a risk we must take if we are to secure loyalty within the Reich."

Recent reports from officials in the navy have caused much worry amongst the Führer and his associates. Much of the new guard in the Kriegsmarine are simply refusing to accept the bribes set in place, and have shown a disregard for the very authority that has given them their positions!\n\nIt appears as if the Führer's decisive action to purge the traitors has created fear and doubt amongst many in the navy, and has weakened our grip over some of the more fleeting factions in the navy. Whether or not the ongoing situation will lead to further instability and factionalism within the navy is unknown as of now, however the situation continues to grow dire.\n\nWe must remedy this situation quickly if we are to maintain stability within our ranks!"

Instead, the Führer's agents happened upon empty houses, having all living essentials abandoned in what seemed to be a hasty flight.

Upon receiving news of the hasty promotion of several new guard officials, many members within the old guard took out actions as a personal attack to their standing within our ranks.\n\nWhat's more, our attempts at undermining the old guards authority have failed drastically. Attempts to implicate the old guard in committing various war crimes against non-aryan populations have failed. Aware that their positions were at stake, several old guard generals have successfully convinced members of the new guard instead to commit such war crimes in the name of the Führer.\n\n"

 goering.2010.desc:0 "While many of the new guards loyalties lie elsewhere, it would be incredibly worthwhile to secure connections and trust with the generals in the new guard in order to maintain control of the Kriegsmarine. In doing so, we would establish a strong influence within the navy and prevent figures such as Speidel from gaining any more followers. However, the sheer number of new guard generals within the navy poses a problem, as it will be quite difficult to bring all of them to our side.\n\nFocusing on securing a majority of the generals would provide us with a large array of support within the navy, preventing a widespread mutiny. While this method would in theory be the most effective, it would be difficult to carry this out in actuality. On the other hand, focusing on a few key generals could prove to be more beneficial. By focusing on generals with more power and influence within the new guard, we could perhaps gain control over the entire new guard via the influence of a few trustworthy individuals.\n\n"

Schorner reviewed his plans mentally; Goring had moved a few weeks earlier than he had expected. It didn't matter that much at this point but still, for a fleeting moment Schorner wondered where that initiative had been earlier.\n\nThe old soldier's hand moved to the nearby radio set.

The loyalty and high regard that the military old guard held for him was unmatched, and the sacking of the old Field Marshall has perhaps only compounded their respect and loyalty for him.\n\nFollowing our failure to find a suitable replacement for the old general in the wake of his sacking, Schörner has wasted not one moment in rallying his base of support around him. Within days, secretive contingency plans were hurriedly dusted off by disloyal militarists. Telephone lines were choked full with frantic and urgent phone calls between military officers around the Reich, enacting all sorts of plans and declaring a plethora of emergency codes.\n\nErratic and unordered military movements have been reported from Elsass to the farthest reaches of our Eastern frontiers. Several prominent members of the military high command have hurriedly fled Germania, as the Oberkommandos report that communication with countless Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, and Heer contingents appears to have been severed. Those few of the General staff who remain in Germania frantically scramble to establish some form of image of the current situation we find ourselves suddenly embroiled in.\n\nBut there is no question as to what's going on.

His veterancy as an officer in the campaigns against the French, Polish, and Russians decades ago should prove popular among the men of the armed forces, and his undeniable charm should surely win over many dissident militarists within the ranks.\n\nWhilst his charm and ground experience is undeniable, it remains to be seen how the militarists will receive the appointment of the young Reichskommissar to the nation's highest military post. The Field Marshal is swamped with allegations of corruption which he has so far been able to charismatically talk himself out of, and the snubbing of more senior members of the old guard will surely agitate many. After all, not even the strongest charms in the world can wash away an old Prussian generals pride."

This sudden and unannounced vacation came mere hours following his swift and unexpected resignation from his post as Chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.\n\nAs a suddenly retired Müller took flight towards Africa, Hermann Göring was left dumbfounded. It was to the Führer's understanding that Müller had understood the situation, and was willing to encumber the task set before him. Why the hell would he suddenly resign, fleeing the nation entirely? None of this made sense to him.\n\nYet, the pieces began to come together. Seemingly within moments of Müller's resignation and flight, Feldmarschall Speidel began to pick up the pieces that were hurriedly left behind, almost as if he expected this series of events to occur. Speidel has now reached out to the Führer about taking up the mantle of OKW chief to swiftly seal the vacuum that has suddenly appeared once again, and has already begun issuing directives amongst several military elements as if he were already in-charge.\n\nWith a fast deteriorating situation, it is clear that Speidel has assumed more effective control over the armed forces than any other man has to this point, and the Führer does not see many other options laid out before him."

The post that he had longed for the return of for years.\n\nDespite Speidel's undeniable effectiveness in wrangling the several ideological wings of the military, relations have always been chilly between the veteran Feldmarschall and the Führer. Ever since Speidel delayed what Göring sees as his rightful ascension into Germania in 1963, the Führer has severely distrusted the veteran Field Marshal. Yet, as the crisis began to unfold throughout the reich as the military sat without a central commander, Göring knew that he must set aside the distrust he held in order to preserve his own increasingly fragile reign.\n\nSpeidel's re-ascension to commandership over the Wehrmacht comes at an ever increasingly trying time for the Reich, reminiscent of the opening days of the Bürgerkrieg years ago. Now Germans find themselves asking but one question: Will Speidel be able to preserve the situation and hold together Göring's Reich?"

Could the Führer really have been so bold as to appoint his family into the highest post achievable by a member of the German military?\n\nThe eyes of the nation did not deceive them. Heinrich Theodore Göring has been appointed by the Führer as the head of the Wehrmacht in this time of crisis. A former second world war luftwaffe pilot turned career officer, he has had a long career in the armed forces, but not as fruitful a career as many other candidates that stood in line for the military's top job. Surely, Heinrich Göring was appointed by the Führer to act as a loyal puppet in control of the Wehrmacht, something that he has lacked from the start of his reign. However, it remains to be seen how well the militarists will swallow this brash appointment."

 goering.2018.t:0 "The Beginning"
 goering.2018.desc:0 "To say that the sacking of Feldmarschall Schörner was controversial would be a gigantic understatement. Even with Führer Göring's efforts to decrease Schörner's massive influence in the Heer, parts of the army protested furiously against what they saw as the final straw in a long list of the Führer's aggression against the army. For being a militarist, as he so claimed, Göring was taking quite the turn towards Bolshevism- at least, that's what the protestors claimed.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Speidelites applauded Schörner's removal. However, this approval has quickly turned into fear of their own. Whispers of Schörner attempting another coup rippled through Speidel's supporters, and soon they became as paranoid as the Schörnerites. If Schörner truly was trying a second coup, would Göring stop him? What would happen to Speidel? What would happen to them?\n\nFrom this moment on, perhaps the consequences of such an earthshaking push was inevitable. Divisions reported to headquarters more and more infrequently, strange new "exercises'' were scheduled and rescheduled- most importantly, Herr Schörner headed east to give a "speaking tour", and Feldmarschall Speidel headed north for "administrative duties." All of these actions were viewed with suspicion, but nothing could be done about them- nothing would rock the boat harder than arresting Schörner and Speidel.\n\nAs it turns out, one doesn't need to rock the boat when it's already sinking.\n\nAs of now, Schörner and thousands of soldiers march on Germania, determined to right the wrongs that Göring has pushed onto them. Their intentions, while not outright stated, are beyond clear. To the north, Speidel marches south on Germania, presumably in a coup attempt of his own, or perhaps solely to stop Schörner from completing his own. Germania itself is in a state of chaos, as thousands flee into the countryside from the impending battle. The Führer's only hope now is that his new Feldmarschall remains loyal to his side. . . "

Finally, while as Führer, the most numbers that Göring ever saw at once were the numbers of casualties from the army's campaigns against the enemy.\n\nThe numbers today, though, were for the Führer's eyes only. Not because he had any specific knowledge about them, but because the result of their leaking would be a catastrophe.\n\nThroughout the Ukraine, thousands of partisan rebels had taken their opportunity and revolted against the regime. Ukraine burns as their natives leave the farms to join the fighting and the Garrison retreats, barely holding it together as is. Other, more pressing numbers and graphs detail food production and grain storage in Germany. With the revolt tearing through the breadbasket of Europe, the food that the Reichskommissariat provides burns with the rest of it. Without the production that the Ukraine provides, there's no way that Göring- or any of the contenders- will be able to feed every German. Grain storages provide some leeway for now, but sooner or later, those will run out, and what then?\n\nGöring slides the paper to his right, out of sight.

The riot on the street was spiraling out of control. Rioters were throwing molotovs, and several MPs were returning fire into the crowd with their sidearms. Tonight, however, the crowd wasn't breaking, they just surged forward in response; several thousand of them massed as one. The yelling on the radio for the two men to open fire continued, but both men ignored it, looking down upon the crowd. Finally, Frederick spoke up. "You think, after your heart is broken twice in a row, that there is hope for the third, Klein?"F The yelling on the radio intensified; radio discipline had broken down as the rioting across the city began to spiral out of control.

Schörner has revolted against him, and Speidel is not on his side as well. For a time, he seems to be the most isolated person in Germany. But today, when reading the reply from Hans Speidel, he finally felt that fortune starts to stand on his side.\n\n"Considering the great dangers that Schörner has brought to our fatherland", in that reply Speidel says, "I agree that he is our common enemy for now, and to eliminate this threat, I'll immediately allied with you, just like what we did in the last stage of the First German Civil War. And I hope, with the combination of our forces, we can end this war as soon as possible."\n\nWhile for now, the future of this war is still too hard to predict, with Speidel's support on his side, Göring's faith is strengthened a lot. For now, he can focus all his troops on the fight against Schörner while Schörner must divide his forces to deal with two enemies. But more importantly, as a revered war hero, Speidel's support will be a perfect example for the people which makes them believe that Hermann Göring is the rightful Führer of the German Reich and the one who will win this war in the end.

Schörner has revolted against him, and Speidel is not on his side as well. But the worst part is, it seems that everything he attempts turned to useless in the end and his bad luck won't have an end forever.\n\nYes, today in Speidel's reply, he rejected Göring's request for an alliance against Schörner and declared that he will not trust Göring, at least for now. Such a result means that, while Schörner is the common enemy for Speidel and Göring, any kind of military cooperation between their two factions is impossible and Göring has to deploy some of his division to guard against Speidel, making his strategic situation even more dangerous.\n\nAnd more terribly. Speidel's rejection will have a very bad influence over Göring's reputation in Germany. Many people are already hating Göring since it has been proved that he is not able to maintain peace and stability, which is what they need most at present. And since Speidel, the old hero who helped Göring and restored peace in the last war, has turned against him, it seems that Göring has already lost his quality and legitimacy to rule Germany in future.\n\nFor now, while the future of this war is still too hard to predict, Göring feels that his prospect is becoming darker and darker each day. But how could all this happen? Did he do anything wrong? Hermann Göring, the once proud ruler of Europe, now thinks that he really has to take a rest before continuing to deal with the hostilities against Schörner, Speidel and anyone who's responsible for drawing him to such a shithole."

 goering.2062.desc:0 "Labour camps have, for decades now, been the punitive norm in the German Reich. What is unprecedented, however, are the reports that have been flowing in from our men who have been fighting alongside Göring's forces.\n\nReports indicate that, rather than holding prisoners of war from this conflict in conventional holding camps, as would be befitting of fellow German combatants, those captured are rather being forced into intensive labour camps under horrific conditions. One camp was reportedly so overfull following the surrender of an enemy division, that the conditions described within the camp beckon to the treatment of captured Soviets in the 1940s. The prisoners in these camps were described as being made to do industrial labour, being forced to meet quotas. Most in the camps wear the tattered uniforms of Heer conscripts. The occasional officer is also scattered about the prisoner populace, bearing his old uniform, but none of the dignity that once came with it. Some prisoners, oddly, suspiciously brandish no uniforms at all, and drag about in seemingly civilian clothing.\n\nYet, most concerning to us, is that one battalion of ours that was passing by one of Görings camps was recognized by the prisoners inside the camp, who began frantically calling out the names of the soldiers in our passing battalion. For those prisoners were of the same battalion, captured weeks ago by Schörners forces. Demanding to know the meaning of the imprisonment of his soldiers, the battalion commander and his men forced their way into the camp, liberating all those who belonged to their forces. It appeared that those men were placed into a prisoner of war camp when captured by Schörners forces, only to be liberated by Görings armies days later. But rather than liberation, they were hushed and placed into another camp. The Führer's labour camp.\n\nSuch criminal treatment of our soldiers is intolerable, and all those in our general staff agree. Outraged, many are calling for us to sever our ties with Hermann Göring entirely, citing that he has gone too far and treated our men as if they were Jewry. On the other hand, we may not be able to afford the loss of such an alliance, and simply placing an ultimatum that the Führer halt these actions may suffice."

That was, until a furious Hans Speidel was on the telephone.\n\nThe hot headed Field Marshal wasted no time with pleasantries, and paid no respects to the Führer. He was clearly not interested in such. He had an ultimatum to give.\n\nApparently, a battalion underneath his command managed to force their way into one of our prisoner of war camps. Within, they claim to have found several of their men among the prisoners, and proceeded to break those men out of our camp. Dumbfounded after being confronted by a friendly force, our guards did little to prevent the chaos.\n\nThe fact does remain, however, that prisoners are not vetted to determine who they fight for. All prisoners of war encountered are simply determined to be hostile, and are rounded along into the labour programmes. Such programmes are essential to the war effort, and it may not be advisable to set a precedent of granting freedom to any prisoner that some unruly commander decides to bring into his ranks. Furthermore, allowing factionalists to make demands of the Führer would be an unacceptable degradation of the Führerprinzip. However, Speidel is a valuable ally. A collection of cool headed generals suggest that we allow the release of these prisoners back to Speidel's custody as a gesture of goodwill and the continued alliance between our forces."

Not only has he refused our reasonable demands that allied soldiery be freed from his labour camps, yet he has also demanded that we subdue ourselves beneath him.\n\nIt has become apparent that the Führer sees Generalfeldmarschall Speidel as little more than pawns upon his chessboard. Speidel finds himself now torn. Should he prove to the overweight Reichsmarschall that he is no mere pawn, and strike now whilst the iron is hot? Or shall he swallow his pride and ambition, and fall in line under the Führer, perhaps this time for good?"

Some feel eased as their disgusting political union with the Croats has finally come to an end, while more people are disappointed as everything has just returned to the back. But no matter what they think now, from now on they will be required abide our laws.\n\nAt this moment our governance of Serbia has been secured, but the question of how still exists and need to be settled immediately. The Chetniks, who served as our allies during both the Second World War and the recent military operation against Yugoslavia, are asking us to keep our promise about an independent Serbia state, and they promised they will continue to follow the Reich's order if we agree on their demands. Meanwhile, we can also just follow our old ways and put the entire Serbia under the Reichskommissariat led by general Leo Hepp, which can bring us more profits but will surely irritate the locals.\n\nThough most our troopers and citizens are enjoying another victory of the Reich, we must make our decisions quickly, for the safe and security of Balkans."

Like other parts of the Reich, when the Fatherland was in fire, our military administration in Serbia was shattered into pieces. Only through the wisdom and courage of the Führer and his loyal soldiers can we save the Reich and retake the lands of Serbia from those despicable Slavs.\n\nIt is said if you wish to eliminate the chaos, you need to find the source of it. And history has shown us that the political situation in Serbia is the crux for all instability in the Balkans. If we can govern Serbia well, then we can have a stable Balkan Peninsula in our sphere, and if we cannot, we will need to face endless rebellions and bloodsheds. The Reichskommissariat Balkanhalbinsel led by General Leo Hepp will be tasked to rule those naughty Serbs. He will certainly make sure that no more shall they dare to challenge our governance.\n\nNow, as Serbia finally returns to our dominance, the whole world waits silently to see what our next target will be. But everyone is certain, that no one in the Balkans can stand against the German nation's wraith."

Though there's still guerilla activities in the countryside and forest, overall, we can proudly announce that the whole Swedish nation has finally joined their Germanic brothers after the millennia of separation.\n\nBut even though the military operation has succeeded at present, our work is still far from over. To utilize local manpower, industries and resources, we need to establish effective administration over our newly conquered land on Scandinavia. Just like other nations, those Swedes will be governed by a Reichskommissariat established by the Reich with the revered general Heinz-Gerog Lemm as the leader. A well-known man who is devoted to the national socialist cause, he'll sure govern this land well and integrate local Swedes into their new Germanic fatherland.\n\nAnd for now, let's rejoice in the glory of the Reich and the unity of we Aryan nations.

Once their task is complete, the Netherlands will finally join the Reich not as a subject, but as yet another Germanic brother, ascending into Aryan superiority. Until then, the focus of Reichskommissariat Niederlande will be to provide as a navally inclined Reichskommissariat- a base of operations for our Kriegsmarine for future operations.

The land where the Finnish people reside in is frozen, but no more frozen than their heart now. After being independent for fifty years, the land of thousand lakes finally falls into another foreign power's hand. And now, we Germans shall decide the fate of their nation.\n\nUnlike their Swedish neighbors, the Finns cannot be seen as our Germanic brothers due to their inferior bloodlines, which means we need to be more careful when establishing our own administrations. Meanwhile, their fierce resistance against Russians in 1940s has proven that their heart of fighting is far hotter than their living environment. If we want to use their abundant natural resources and industries as well as suppressing local guerillas, we need to find accountable for such a task. Let's hope that general Heinz-Gerog Lemm and his Reichskommissariat can do their duty toward the fatherland.\n\nEven in the far north part of the Europe, the Wehrmacht's marching boot cannot be stopped, and the aurora in the high sky bears the greatness and vigilancy of the German nation."

The only problem is, it takes many of their bloods and lives to realize such an easy fact when the Wehrmacht returned to their land, and now, their fates is on our hands once again.\n\nIt is obvious that the previous administration of Norway established in 1940 proved to a total failure, for the Norwegians never truly acknowledge our regime as well as the Reich as their fatherland. Such a mistake cannot be repeated anymore. The newly established Reichskommissariat Skandinavien led by Heinz-Georg Lemm will ensure that Norway stays a inseparable part of the German Reich forever.\n\nNow, another Germanic nation is reclaimed by the Reich, and under the genius leadership of our Führer, soon we shall bring unity and glory to the whole Aryan race.

Still, even with all of its military's weaknesses, reports on the ground indicated that the soldiers of the Royal Bulgarian Army fought as well as anyone could have given their equipment and manpower shortages that would end up fatally compromising them. The fall of Bulgaria represents the latest domino to be knocked over by the whirlwind force of nature that has been the German war machine under its bombastic new leader. Governance of Bulgaria's territory has been given over to the Reichskommissariat Balkanhalbinsel as was the case with its fellow Balkan victims, including the Kingdom of Romania."

In the streets, broadcast is announcing that the old regime is no more, replaced by the Reichskommissariat Brittanien established by the Reich directly.\n\nThough most people have been familiar with changes of regime in recent decades, the atmosphere in the city is still odd since it is the first time in a thousand years that England is ruled, both in name and in fact, by a power foreign from their homeland.

With every contender eliminated Goering has ordered the region once under the domain of the Iberian Union to be balkanized into some half a dozen Reichskommisariats, most of whom are led by members of Hans Speidel's faction or members of the "New Guard" of the military high command.

Today he was adorned in his blue Luftwaffe uniform, its medals clanking as he took his position behind the podium. Behind him stood his most loyal advisors: the bespectacled Ferdinand Schörner, the sneering Otto Ernst Remer, the smartly suited Wilhelm Stuckart.\n\n"Members of the Reichstag," Göring spoke after a few moments of silence, gripping the podium tightly with his jewelled fingers. "I have humbly accepted the Führer's offer to become his official successor. Many of you will know that such a proposition has been enshrined in our law since 1938. I am proud to say that the strength of our relationship has only grown in this time." His eyes, blue and narrow, dragged themselves across the brown masses of the Reichstag. "The Reich, however, has only weakened! As your Führer, I promise to drag us from the marshy swamp of our own making and into a glorious new era!" His voice grew slightly strained as he continued the speech. "I shall deliver us into an age of absolute military domination over our foes. Make no mistake. The Führer's vision for Europe must be completed!"\n\nA sporadic wave of applause swept through the crowd, emanating largely from the militarists and Wehrmacht officers, but also from a few conservatives. Göring gave an uneasy smile and glanced behind him, where Schörner was watching on eagerly.\n\n"To strengthen our beautiful Vaterland," Göring continued, "we must save our economy from the clutches of those who wish to exploit it for their own selfish purposes. You know who I'm talking about!" Göring's voice grew more energetic, and he puffed out his chest in excitement. "I'm talking about the parasitic German bankers! I'm talking about the Swiss! Let us revitalize our economy, let us re-energize the German workforce, let us abolish wasteful spending on useless projects that plague the Reich!""

The camera clicked multiple times. He was wearing his personalized dove-gray uniform, complete with medals. He turned back to the photographer. "Bernhard, was it? Ah, Bertold. My apologies. Show me yesterday's photograph. The one with the blue Luftwaffe uniform." Bertold brought the printed photo over. "Hmm... I want that one destroyed. This is going in the newspapers, remember. I must look my best."\n\nSchörner arrived in the doorway with a small document tucked under his arm. Göring beckoned him over and examined the papers. The Feldmarschall had drafted a plan to violently suppress the student protests that had broken out since his appointment as successor. Bertold was prowling around the room, experimenting with different angles and muttering to himself. The young photographer had probably been a student himself, not so long ago. Göring gave a heavy sigh. He handed the document back and nodded his approval. Oh well. The students had been growing more and more unruly. It was time they were taught a lesson.\n\n"Reichsmarschall Göring," the photographer whispered in a shaking voice, drawing Göring from his thoughts. "I took a photograph of your plan. The one ordering Heer troops to use brutal force against the peaceful student protests. I will leak this photo unless you cancel this order immediately. Is that understood?"\n\nGöring stared at the young man in shock, but said nothing. He simply rose to his feet, thanked him for his time, and walked over to the waiting Schörner.

Wilhelm Stuckart lowered his fork and frowned in confusion.\n\n"No need to worry yourself, Wilhelm," Göring grinned as he inspected the photo. The image was of Göring sitting down on a chair and inspecting a document. One of the papers was hanging loosely in full view of the camera, detailing much of Schörner's plans against the student protests. "We'll get back to matters of policy in a second."\n\n"I regret to inform you that our good friend Bertold took a nasty fall from his apartment window," Schörner shook his head in mock grief. "He was quite high up, I'm afraid."\n\n"He must have been taking photos of the sky!" Göring roared with laughter, slamming the table in his hand. He wiped a tear from his eye and turned to Stuckart. "You haven't got a lighter, have you?" He plucked the lighter from his advisor's palm and lit it underneath the image with glee. The bright yellow flames licked across the photograph, contorting the image as it folded and blackened. Göring watched on with satisfaction, the flames reflected in his pale blue eyes."

Naturally, Göring had hired a new photographer. Someone more professional. Someone older. Someone less likely to support Speer. That didn't stop him from getting on his nerves.\n\nSchörner arrived at the doorway. Göring strode over him with a thunderous expression and swung his baton, hitting the Feldmarschall in the side of the arm. The officer looked more shocked than hurt.\n\n"You useless fucking idiot! I told you to exterminate that little rat Bertold! Why the fuck is he still alive to leak photos of our plan? The protests have tripled in size!" Göring was about to throw his baton to the floor in fury but stopped himself at the last moment. It was too precious to risk breaking. "That agent you sent to deal with Bertold? The one who got fucking caught? I want him liquidated immediately."\n\n"Is that necessary, Hermann?" Schörner responded with gritted teeth, rubbing his sore arm. Any other day, he would have exploded with fury. "Does it matter what the students think? They weren't going to support you anyway."\n\n"Have. Him. Liquidated. I won't ask again.

There were several chants, disparate and sporadic, but the loudest without question was: "Down with Göring!"\n\nClaus gripped his rifle tightly and looked towards his comrades for assurance.

The closest cluster backed away instantly, apart from one girl who thrust her anti-Göring sign forwards and screamed back. One of the soldiers walked up and smashed her in the face with the butt of his rifle.\n\n"Disperse!" Claus yelled. His voice cracked. He raised his rifle at the students, who dropped their signs and darted. He saw a group of soldiers tackling a pair of brick-throwers to the ground and smashing them to a bloody pulp with their boots. Another comrade fired a shot into the papier-mâché head, which exploded as the crowd nearby broke apart with a cry. Claus did not let the fear overtake him. He was a soldier of the Reich. Sure, these were fellow Germans... students, around his age... but they were protesting against the next Führer, against the Reich.

He had ordered a display of power on a grand scale not seen since the glorious celebrations following the triumph of the Second Welktkrieg. It had been expensive, of course, but his revitalization of the economy following the Führer's inevitable demise would more than make up for it.\n\nA sense of pride surged through him as the Hermann Göring Division marched onwards to lead the procession. The splendor of those uniforms, the synchronization of their steps, and sheer beauty of those mechanicals creatures rolling forward... it was almost too much to handle.

Make sure this one is released first."\n\nNewspaper and speech extracts. Quotes by esteemed Party members. Newsreel footage of Hitler and Göring shaking hands, or standing side by side on the Reichstag balcony, or deliberating over war plans. Audio recordings of Hitler praising Göring.

That was, until this morning. Residents and soldiers alike of Reichsmarschall Göring's territory looked up to the sky just in time to see a bolt of lighting arc through the skies and towards the enemy lines.\n\nThe pilot of this craft? Johannes 'Macky' Steinhoff, top ace of the loyal Luftwaffe and a veteran of both the Second World War and the West Russian War. Steinhoff distinguished himself as the first operational pilot of the Luftwaffe's crowning joy during the Second World War, Me 262 jet. Tragically, Steinhoff was significantly burned across much of his body in a horrific crash during one of his take offs. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Steinhoff was one of the leading Luftwaffe instructors, but his desire to support his beloved Luftwaffe was so great that he immediately resigned his position and volunteered to fly once more.\n\nGöring, former Reichsmarschall des Luftwaffe of the German Reich, has personally congratulated Steinhoff, and offered him a promotion once the war for Germany has been won."

It was not the past he was here to meet however, but the future. That was why he was constantly checking his custom-made, lavishly expensive watch while he sipped from the establishment's trademark brew. His guest was running late, but given the enormous stakes for which the appointed successor of the Fuhrer was playing, a few minutes give or take were mere trivialities. For the past month he had been on a blitz to wine and dine the upper crust of the Reich's society, using every bit of charisma and charm to win over the elites who would be able to bring considerable resources to bear in the event he needed it.\n\nAs Göring waited he continued to drink, and as he drank he allowed his mind to wander back to the past. Meeting Adolf, hosting the Alter Kampfer at Carin's insistence. The names of his old comrades flashed through his mind: Hitler, Rosenberg, Hess, even Rohm. Fucking Rohm. The degenerate pervert had gotten what was coming to him. That was long in the past however, and only was worth remembering as a testament to how fickle one's grip on authority and power could be. Whatever else might happen, Göring promised himself in that moment, he would never allow himself to end up as Rohm had. He would sooner drink a mug of poison then be humiliated in such a manner.\n\nThe slam of a door brought him out of his memories. He looked over to see the man he had been waiting for all night. He stood up to properly greet his guest and with a jovial smile he bellowed out:"

 goering_successor.14.d:0 "Nothing would ever be normal in the Reich again, the erupting Civil War had seen to that as sure as the sunrise. Still, even for the often ludicrous chaos that was now all too common across the globe, this was something else. Hermann Göring watched as the small military transport plane came in for a landing at the Kiel airport. Fighters and interceptors circled lazily in the sky, keeping the way safe for the small craft even in the capital of the provisional government that Göring had proclaimed following the death of Adolf Hitler. This VIP was too valuable to take any chances with.\n\nIt was Bormann. Not Martin of course; the conniving bastard was no doubt in Wien right now, hearing news of what Göring had pulled, shaking his fist impotently. No, this was Albert Bormann, the brother, who apparently had gotten any sense the family line had ever possessed. He had always displayed far more sense than Martin in supporting Göring's economic and military ambitions, and when Hitler had named Göring as his rightful successor, Albert had offered his services.\n\nHaving the brother of the man who was the biggest threat to his rule firmly within his camp was an utter coup, and the propaganda value was not lost on the would-be dictator. Even as he stood expectantly as the plane came to a smooth halt, the printers in every loyal city were churning out posters of Albert endorsing the rightful leader of the German people by the thousands. Göring smiled as he played out dozens of scenes of Martin's rage and consternation over and over again in his mind."

Already, Panzer divisions stream across [GGR_Defender.GetName], and fighting has broken out rapidly as [GGR_Defender.GetName] makes its stand against German aggression.\n\nHope for [GGR_Defender.GetName] seems scant. No matter how powerful its military, they stand against what is perhaps the world's mightiest. Only a superpower seems destined to survive the battle against another superpower-at least until one considers nuclear weaponry. Even then, Germany may be more posed than any to win the ground war, boasting what could be the largest military the modern world has ever seen and the technology to use it.\n\nThis leaves [event nation] in a poor position. It is doubtful that the war drums will go silent even after [GGR_Defender.GetName] falls. With that in mind, we should prepare for the inevitable onslaught, but others argue our efforts should instead go towards preventing it from ever coming here.

Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the Germans just didn't send them enough guns. It takes a lot of support to overthrow a proper, stable, functioning government like our lovely friends in France, and the German aid just wasn't up to the task. This has added up to these armed forces "controlling" France to actually be a handful of fascists in fancy uniforms with some scary-looking guns walking around the street with no real ground-level control.\n\nBecause of this situation, we are in a prime position to take action.

Neatly, Himmler placed what remained down into the bin nearby, and dusted his hands off before standing up from his chair. The bull-headed pig knew he couldn't phase Himmler, but he tried anyway, and to no effect. He would have said, perhaps, to let the forces of the Reich come, but even then he assumed Göring was too much of a coward to heed his own advice.\n\nWith a slight shake of his head and a quiet sigh that escaped his lips, Himmler turned the lights off to his office and left.

Korner's eyes surveyed the office within the Fuhrerbunker where he had moved to following his internal announcement commencing "War Plan C". There was an empty wine bottle there at the side of the desk, a vintage old enough that Korner was shocked it wasn't in the cellars of Carinhall. That wasn't something you were supposed to just drink from for pity's sake. What was going on with the Fuhrer? His old friend had gone clean years ago and yet, something had shaken that. Korner shuddered, afraid of what the answer was.\n\nBut back to the matter at hand. He had been called here to talk fortifications, and so on fortifications he would focus his thoughts. He quickly rescanned the proposal he had been brusquely handed as he had come in. That was quite a bit of resources the Fuhrer wanted shifted, and in such a short amount of time.\n\nKorner looked his old comrade in the eyes, "Hermann, what exactly are these for? I thought the plan was to push into Burgundy, no?"\n\nGoring grimaced like a man in deep pain. For a moment he remained utterly silent and Korner felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Then, with a furtive look around him as if to check to see if the two men were truly alone, the Fuhrer bent in. His voice low and quiet, he began to speak, "Remer has been heading up the invasion and you know he is even less interested in my commands than Schorner is. In fact he doesn't even seem interested in listening to the Field Marshall anymore either. Serves him right. But I can't guarantee what will happen when the fighting begins. These forts will be our insurance policy, our backup and our defense if the army completely falls apart. Do you understand now?"\n\nKorner nodded soberly, "I do, Hermann.

It was hard to compare the sheer amount of people to those days though; attendance was off the charts, to Remer's pleasure. He stood in front of the podium, relishing the cheers from over a hundred-thousand of his fellow countrymen that stood in front of him, overfilling the plaza.\n\n"My fellow Germans! My brothers! My countrymen!" Remer began. The crowd roared back in assent; their approval shaking the ground itself. Remer stood, a large grin on his face. This, he thought, must be how Hitler felt. He scanned the massive crowd, looked upon the massive Swastika banners hanging from the buildings, then at the old man sitting to his right, with the Reich's highest ranking officers sitting around him. Göring, for his part, did look regal. His uniform neatly pressed as always, with his badges glinting in the afternoon sun. His expressiveness, however, was stoic. No emotions were expressed on his stony face. Remer knew he didn't want to be there, but what could he do? What kind of Führer would miss this occasion? The crowd's noise begin to die down.\n\n"Today is a momentous day..." Remer continued. "For the Reich is about to claim what is rightfully ours! Finally, after so much time, we will finally lay low the rest of the traitors that oppose us in the old world!" The crowd again roared their approval. Remer nodded his head in agreement.\n\n"For too long; MUCH too long, the Japanese cowards have exploited the peoples of Asia. For decades, they work the blood of nationalist while spiting us, US! Even though, without us, there would be no Japanese Empire! The cowards have sat in their corner of the world for long enough. It is time to bring low the last of our so called friends, those that thought they could get away with using the Reich and her peoples as a means to an end!"\n\nThe crowd went mad, and the din of so many in such a small area was deafening. Remer stepped down, motioning for Göring to take the stage. For a moment, tensions on the stage were worryingly high as the Führer glared at Remer. But,he stood up and walked to the microphone.

No words really needed to be spoken as Göring read the bill that Schörner had wordlessly dropped on his desk for the Führer's rubber stamp of approval. It was no wonder that Schörner looked dejected.\n\nThe leader of the militrist faction, that clique that now dominated the government, had lost control over rabid war-mongers. Göring skimmed over the bill. "...in anticipation of a great struggle..." blah, blah, blah. More of the same nonsense. What stood out, "...Otto Ernst Remer, in reward for devoted and distinquished service, is to also be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal." Damn. The most wild of the mad dogs was now a top leader. No wonder Schörner looked defeated; even he had lost control over the militarists. It seemed as though war with the other superpowers of the world was now inevitable. Göring wordlessly pulled out his seal and stamped the bill, handing it back to Schörner. The only words spoken between the two were finally said by Göring.

The only aspect in common was their penchant for dark sunglasses. At an unspoken signal, the representatives broke from their packs and approached one another.\n\nReichsminister Artur Axmann responded to the "Assalaam 'alaikum" with a jumbled and stilted "Wa 'alaikum assalaam". With foreign pleasantries out of the way, he more confidently extended his hand and switched to German. "It is a pleasure to finally reach your great kingdom. Führer Göring extends the hand of friendship to King Faisal and all of the Arabian people."\n\nThe Arab diplomat nodded graciously.

We trust your landing was not too rough - the King Abdulaziz International Airport is still under construction, but by its completion it will be the greatest airport in all Arabia."\n\nAxmann cast his gaze around. Indeed, it seemed as though the hand of god had lifted construction equipment from Germania itself and dropped it into the middle of the desert. The scale of construction was vast, sprawling into the edges of Jeddah itself. The town was expanding at the rate of knots - even from the air, one could see the pace of it's growth, spilling over its boundaries like a flood. Yes, the House of Saud could prove a valuable ally, if they could be appropriately wooed.

Once Axmann's appetite had been sated, the Saudi delegation had begun to bring their terms to the table. "Herr Axmann," their leader, one Muhammad Abdullah ibn Saud said in a thick accent. "King Faisal has been most impressed by the Reich's success in its recent campaigns. The Saudi Kingdom's arms industry, while most effective, is small.

Some comment Axmann made caught Muhammad Abdullah's attention though, and he interjected. "Indeed, Germany's assertion of it's sphere of influence has been deeply impressive - however, the question of our own Kingdom's role in the area must be raised. While Persia is indeed a naturally Aryan domain, there exist states in the Persian Gulf, formerly under Italian dominion, that have long yearned for independence.

Axmann was discussing the great scale of construction in Germania at length, though strategically failing to mention it's advanced decrepitude in the less desirable areas. Muhammad Abdullah laughed politely, and brought his own anecdote to the table, smoothly flowing into a request.\n\n"I do wish to one day see the great city of Germania, for its riches are told of across the globe. King Faisal too wishes to see Riyadh as a mighty capital for his kingdom, and Germania is seen by all as the model city.

The former Italian client state has realigned itself with the Reich, becoming an equal partner and avoiding the grim fate of its neighbours. With the treaty signed, there was an official exchange of gifts. To the Reich was presented a beautifully ornate scimitar, upon which was inscribed many blessings and prayers towards the Führer's health and wellbeing. To the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was gifted a great portrait of the Führer, signed with the hand of Göring himself. Axmann gave himself an internal pat on the back.

An end to negotiations meant an end to his stay, and an explanation for his failure to reach terms. Of course, there always remained the possibility of badmouthing his hosts - more like than not an invasion had been inevitable, he had always said so.\n\n"I thank you and King Faisal deeply for your hospitality, Mohammed Abdullah.

Whilst the All Russian Military League is nominally a collaborationist state, control over this vast area is weak and true collaborators are few and far between given Germany's reputation. The Reich considers them little more than cannon fodder at best and unworthy of life at worst. Messages have travelled across the steppe, carried by Russian and Mongolian horsemen, that suggest the League would be much happier working with Japan than Germany.\n\nTo steal Russia from under the Reich's nose would no doubt be considered an act of war, but war is all but inevitable.

The veteran pilot noted that each digit was crowned with at least one jeweled ring. The value of the man's hands must have been worth more than an ME262. The 262; thinking about the jet had been a mistake. He felt himself once again in the cockpit, the sickening drop, the blinding flash. Then the fire, the awful flames that he could feel even now.\n\nIt took a supreme effort to regain his bearings. That was the past he reminded himself. That was the past and this is the present that must be focused on. If the corpuscular despot noticed the inner monologue, he didn't announce it. Instead, he gestured to a chair. Once the ace had seated himself comfortably, he plunged into the question that had been hanging above them this whole time.\n\n"My Fuhrer, while I deeply appreciate the trust you seem to place in me, I am still unsure as to why you want me specifically to lead your Luftwaffe."\n\nTo his surprise, Fuhrer Goring smiled, "Ah straight down to business, eh? I like that in a subordinate you know. Always good to get right to the important parts and leave small talk for later, yes that's just what I require."\n\nHe began to say something else, but stopped himself, looking to Steinhoff as if he might be nervous about something.\n\n"The truth is General Steinhoff..." he was quieter now, almost conspiratorial, "the truth is that I need someone who isn't beholden to either the butcher or the pissant by my side."\n\nSchorner and Speidel - the realization dawned on Johannes, the Fuhrer was apparently not fond of his top officers it seemed.\n\n"It will be a tall task no doubt, but I offer to spare no expense for my Luftwaffe you understand. Anything you want, you'll have no questions asked. Nominally of course you'll have to report to Generalfeldmarschall Schorner at OKW really you'll be answerable to me and me alone. Just send him some paperwork every now and again and I'll keep him off you. So, what do you say?""
 goering.1703.a:0 ""I suppose I don't have much of a choice.""

 goering.1704.t:0 "The Pencil Pushing Admiral"
 goering.1704.d:0 ""So, what do you think, Admiral Puttkamer?" The Fuhrer studied the face of his guest, looking for a hint of the demanded decision. As usual, Puttkamer kept his poker face. Or maybe it was just indifference? In all their years together the old Reichsmarschall had never been able to parse out how much of the inscrutability Adolf's old adjutant exuded as a matter of personal policy or as simple disinterest. He briefly wondered if he had born a similar expression in those days when he had taken to the morphine needle. No, he decided after a little thought, even in the worst of his stupor he had always had the flame of ambition and the will to carry it forward. Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer was nothing like him.\n\nSo why then was he giving such a man the reins of the Kriegsmarine? Rather, what was left of the Kriegsmarine following the defections and the blow of Donitz's mutiny anyhow. Goring could have given a dozen public-ready answers at that moment: the man had served Adolf impeccably, he had a long and distinguished career, on and on. The truth however was far simpler. The man had no ambition whatsoever. Even the humblest of clerks in the Reich's government knew that the new Fuhrer was, to put it politely, not very interested in the functioning of the navy. That meant it was best left to someone else to manage, and better a man with little desire to abuse his authority than one hungry for more power. Never another Donitz, that was Goring's sole criteria when he began his search, and it was the criteria he followed when he landed on Puttkamer.\n\n"I just want to remind you," the heavy-set dictator said softly, noticing the lack of response to the ultimate question, "that I do not intend to bother you on your duties. Nor will General Schorner be given free reign either. You will of course report to him, but that doesn't mean he has any more desire to manage your affairs than I do. Frankly, I'd consider it a great favor for you to remove the navy from all this factional bickering once and for all."\n\nPuttkamer nodded slowly, almost... thoughtfully.\n\nThat was all Goring needed, an acceptance, whether Puttkamer had realized it or not. With profuse thanks he escorted his new Grossadmiral to the door. For his part, Puttkamer put up no resistance, seemingly consigned to his new role. Good, Goring thought as he closed the door to his office, he hated when things were made difficult."
 goering.1704.a:0 "Who even needs Dönitz?"

 goering.1705.t:0 "The Hard Sell"
 goering.1705.d:0 ""My Fuhrer, I must again insist that I do not feel as though I would be the best candidate to assume the position, especially in light of who my superior would be."\n\nGoring glared at the old war hero. Hours of this damnable stalemate was making him frustrated and irritable. Not for the first time he considered directly ordering Speidel to assume control of OKH, but then that would have to be an absolute last resort. He needed the general to agree to take the position and needed him to, if not enjoy his place in the new regime, be a check against Schorner.\n\nSpeidel must have thought that ended it, he began to rise from his chair. That made Goring snap, "Damnit general, do you not understand the stakes at play here? Do you think this is all about personal pride and pleasure? It isn't!"\n\nSpeidel's annoyance was written across his face. He clearly resented this lecture. Goring knew he had to make an all or nothing attempt if he wanted to salvage the situation.\n\n"Listen general, if you wish to serve the Reich and its people in the most effective way, then you must accept. Do you wish to see the entire Wehrmacht in the hands of Schorner? I certainly don't but it seems you do, if you'd simply walk away at this opportunity to limit his influence. Accept, and we can work together to make sure he isn't the only voice in my ear."\n\nThat got Speidel to stop. He responded slowly, thoughtfully, "If I were to accept, and that's only an if at this point, I would need some guarantees of non-interference from Schorner if the goal is to actually be effective in my position-. Would that be possible?"\n\nThe Fuhrer smiled; he had Speidel hooked. "I can't guarantee a miracle but I should be able to wring out some concessions for your autonomy."\n\nSpeidel sighed, nodded, "The things we do for the Reich...""

 goering.1706.d:0 "Gaspard had delivered a meal as splendid as always. The Führer made a mental note to reward Carinhall's resident chef, maybe he would even give the slaves who assisted him a day or two off. He was feeling magnanimous after such a lovely dinner. But enjoying his meal, even an excellent one, was not the purpose of the night. No, the purpose was the two men who flanked Göring on either side of the table. On his right sat Albert Bormann, the loyal brother, and to his left was seated his nephew Heinz Theodore. The pair also seemed to be savoring the experience.\n\n"Uncle, the roast beef is exquisite, I've never had it served so well before. Your cook will have to give mine the recipe one of these days."\n\nGoring smiled, "Thank you Theodore, but the food can be discussed later, I think. Right now I need to ask both of you," he motioned for Albert to join the conversation, "to prove your loyalty to me."\n\nAlbert, always trying to make up for his familial shame, was predictably quick to respond, "Of course my, Führer, whatever it is you need we will provide. I swear we are both your devoted servants."\n\nTheodore lamely nodded along, never one for having much in the way of independent thought. That would actually help in this case however.\n\n"My friends, the Reich is at a crossroads. We may have triumphed in the civil war but I must still contend with the Wehrmacht. They believe I owe my position to their efforts alone! Knowing that tenacious bastard Schorner, they will never let me forget it. That's where you two come in. I need men I can absolutely trust within the high command, men willing to keep me updated on everything the generals do. Gentlemen, can I count on your service?""

 goering.1707.d:0 "As he strutted into Hermann Göring's office, Reinhard Gehlen noticed the Führer seemed somewhat nervous. It was a rare state to see him in, and Gehlen wondered what had occurred to induce it. He would have his men look into it. Before he could further ponder it, however, the Führer addressed him. "Herr Gehlen. Welcome. I trust you mean to accept my offer? The Abwehr is in need of a new chief soon, and if you do not intend to take the position, I will need to begin searching for a suitable alternative immediately."\n\n"There is no need for that." Gehlen responded, curtly. "I intend to take the position, of course." He noticed the Führer's eyes wandering towards the door, so he glanced over his shoulder. There was no one there. His attention turned back to Göring, who had begun to focus rather intently on Gehlen instead. "However, if I may ask... is there a reason this promotion was not offered to me by Feldmarschall Schörner? The Abwehr is within his purview, is it not?"\n\nGöring looked as if Gehlen had slapped him. "I am the goddamn fucking Führer, and I appoint who I please." His voice was a quiet hiss, as if he did not want any outburst to be overheard. The Führer glanced at the door once again, before continuing, more calmly. "Schörner may cut your checks and take credit for your work, but as long as I am Führer, you report to me first. Is that understood?" Göring's eyes bored into the spymaster, a mix of domineering and desperate. Gehlen, suddenly having gained a much clearer understanding of what was occurring, quickly nodded."

 goering.1708.t:0 "From the Homefront"
 goering.1708.d:0 "The air screamed with the sounds of the machinery as production line upon production line produced the weapons of conquest and death. Jon hadn't heard the Dresden factory shriek out this much for almost a decade now. Even during the civil war, the factory had been quieter. What that meant for the future, the slave shuddered to imagine. He had seen the horrors of war firsthand, as his beloved Poland was crushed under the Nazi boot all those years ago. No one deserved such a fate.\n\nThe conveyor belt sent more half-assembled grenades his way, waiting for final assembly. It was then that the idea came to him. It was a foolish, brazen idea. But Jon had always been a daredevil in his youth. It was the memories of those days in the streets of Lublin, getting into mischief with tinkering with the watches in his father's shop that drove him forward. A modification here, an adjustment there, and the grenades would detonate much sooner. WIth any luck, they'd take whatever Nazi bastard was throwing them to Hell.\n\nThey had made the factories to be as efficiently possible, producing as much material as they could wring out through slave labor. For the first time since being sent to the damned place, Jon was happy about that fact. He was producing the defective explosives at a truly prodigious rate. Even the foreman seemed impressed, granting him an extra hour of rest for his efforts. Jon almost laughed out loud, but kept his composure and facade of submission.\n\nJon had long ago abandoned his faith, but he prayed to God now, for the nations of the world. He prayed his contribution to their defence would be felt; one life saved was all he asked for."
