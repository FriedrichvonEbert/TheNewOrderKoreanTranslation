 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BAURYZHAN_MOMYSHULY_DESC:0 "General Momyshuly is a hero of both the Soviet Union and Kazakhstan and he will always be loyal to his two homelands. He hails from a humble background and worked various state jobs in Kazkahstan before being conscripted and eventually would lead multiple division in the war. Some have called Momyshuly an anti-Soviet Kazakh nationalist due to his love of Alash Orda poetry, a few even calling for his removal from the Soviet armed forces completely. His loyalities would be tested with the German invasion. Not only were his loyalties to the Soviet Union confirmed, but so was his loyalty to Leninist doctrine itself.\n\nWhen the war ended, Momyshuly quickly reorganized the forces and commanders that remained and reestablished the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. He now controls the most land and wields the strongest army in Kazakhstan. In his mind, the Soviet Union and communism has only been temporarily destroyed and is just waiting for a catalyst to revive it. He is determined to be that catalyst."

 KAZ_last_days_bandit:0 "Last Days Of The Bandit Kings"
 KAZ_last_days_bandit_desc:0 "Since the fall of the Union our army, while it fought valiantly, has been unable to deal with the infestation of bandits within our borders. The territory of Kyzylorda, while encompassing a third of Kazakhstan, has authority over a much less. Bandits have taken power in many areas and have become rich off raiding. This has to end. General Secretary Momyshuly has a plan to deal with these "bandit kings" that has been years in the making. They may not know it, but these are the last days of banditry in Kazakhstan."
 KAZ_set_the_trap:0 "Set The Trap"
 KAZ_set_the_trap_desc:0 "A swift decapitation of the bandit leadership is a key component for dealing with this threat. For this operation we need to lure in the leadership of the various clans and petty "kingdoms" placate each one, and finally kill them all. While many potential execution methods have been proposed, the one decided on is to use German bombing campaigns to our advantage. Use radio static to get bombers near our preffered to location, and lure in the bandit leaders. Those outlaws are survivors, but few leave them a barrage of bombs alive."
 KAZ_whisper_campaign:0 "Whisper Campaign"
 KAZ_whisper_campaign_desc:0 "Distrust is a potent weapon of war. Destroying the leadership can only do so much, for others will rise to the occasion. Sowing distrust between groups and within groups by spreading unpleasent rumors and incessantly blackmailing will do no good for any groups wishing us harm. After all, how can they attack us when they are busy clawing at each other's throats?"
 KAZ_close_the_escape:0 "Close The Escape"
 KAZ_close_the_escape_desc:0 "Call the troops! Round the snipers! When those criminals try to claw themselves out of the meeting place, they will be met with guns pointed straight at them, and if we're lucky, bullets in their head. Of course, we'll have to scout out the locations and pull our troops from the border, but internal matters must be dealt with before we can go on the offensive. "
 KAZ_add_treats:0 "Add The Bait"
 KAZ_add_treats_desc:0 "Bait will be needed to attract the bandits to the trap, by leaving a small amount of military equipment we will be able to ensure as many bandits as possible are brought to the trap, making the bombing attack all the more successful. While this will hurt our military in the short run it will be a bonus in the long run for the damage done."
 KAZ_unleash_hounds:0 "Unleash The Hounds"
 KAZ_unleash_hounds_desc:0 "With the date for when the trap is to be sprung closing in we will need forces that will quickly close in and attack bandit camps around the country and crush them before retreating and letting the rest fight amongst themselves. It's time to unleash the hounds to track down the various bandit camps so our troops can strike when the time is right."
 KAZ_spring_the_trap:0 "Spring The Trap"
 KAZ_spring_the_trap_desc:0 "The time is now, with the proper preparations we will be able to draw in the various leaders of the bandit groups and then with large amounts of radio communication in the area, get the germans to bomb the region. This should hopefully kill them all and with the distrust sown between the groups the bandit should fall into a state of civil war between each other, then all we will have to do is mop up the pieces."
 KAZ_clean_streets:0 "Clean The Streets"
 KAZ_clean_streets_desc:0 "With a open war going on between the various bandit groups, many towns and cities have been engulfed in violence that while we have predicted has been damaging on the cities.

 KAZ_no_mercy:0 "Show No Mercy"
 KAZ_no_mercy_desc:0 "With a number of major figures that survived the trap captured and arrested we have to decide what to do with them, it has been decided not to show any mercy to demoralise the other bandits and execute these figures.

 KAZ_send_the_cavalry:0 "Send In The Cavalry"
 KAZ_send_the_cavalry_desc:0 "With the bandit war winding to its end and the groups having decimated each other it's time to send in our cavalry and mop up the remnants of these groups. These pathetic remnants should not put up a lot of resistance and should easily be crushed, only then we can begin rebuilding the country."
 KAZ_purge_zhezqazghan:0 "Purge Zhezqazghan"
 KAZ_purge_zhezqazghan_desc:0 "With the fighting over all that remains is one last stronghold, the city of Zhezqazghan has been inhabited by a number of the fake Khans men that broke away. They have managed to avoid the majority of the fighting and remained relatively unharmed, we must destroy them and purge the city of their influence if we ever want to recover. This is the last hurdle and they shall be overcome like all the rest."
 KAZ_over_and_done:0 "Over And Done With"
 KAZ_over_and_done_desc:0 "With the fighting done we should get the trial stage over and done with as fast as possible so we can get onto recovering.

 KAZ_fair_trials:0 "Fair Trials"
 KAZ_fair_trials_desc:0 "With the fighting done we must ensure fair trials to take place to judge and sentence those bandits that offended.

 KAZ_kangaroo_courts:0 "Kangaroo Courts"
 KAZ_kangaroo_courts_desc:0 "The quickest way to deal with the hundreds of bandits is through various kangaroo courts.

 KAZ_reward_our_troops_desc:0 "If it wasn't for our troops then we would have never stood a chance all these years against the various bandit groups and external threats.

 KAZ_make_them_fear:0 "Make Them Fear"
 KAZ_make_them_fear_desc:0 "With the bandits dealt with and put on trial, it's time to make the remaining ones in hiding and any others that wish to become bandits to fear us. By fearing us from what we have done, none will take up banditry and our state will remain stable in the years to come."
 Kaz_case_by_case:0 "Case By Case"
 Kaz_case_by_case_desc:0 "To be truly just we must analyse each case that is brought before the court and not rush through procedures to make sure no innocents are accidentally charged with crimes that they did not do.

 KAZ_reward_the_people:0 "Reward The People"
 KAZ_reward_the_people_desc:0 "We only survived not only due to our military but also the people of the state for backing our regime, they could have turned their back on us like many other people in different regions, but the people within our state stayed loyal to the true just cause and they will be rewarded through the spoils of war along with our military, it is what they deserve."

Doing this will allow us to spread the farm produces more equally, reducing the risk of any further famines, and curtailing inequality along the way.

Fast exploitation tactics are viable all-year, and the lack of geographical impediment means that properly trained and equipped motorized divisions can rush the enemy, encircling and trapping them in pockets.

The Kazakh proletariat, which became free from the prejudices and superstitions of the past, will not follow the preachings of the parochial imams of Zabelkin. Armed with the hammer of modernity, the proletarian soldiers will smash the dogmatic ignorance of fundamentalists."

Among them were the sons and daughters of Poland, who were forcibly resettled by Nazis in Western Kazakhstan. The Soviet government generously gave them shelter, but in the anarchy that followed, the Polish ASSR seceded from Soviet Kazakhstan.\n\nAs it stands, the "New Poland" does not recognize the Soviet power but neither it does seek to spread their reactionary customs and their government is mostly motivated by desire of their people to settle down in the new home. If we guarantee their safety and protection in exchange for acknowledging the ideals of Communism and preserving rights for their Kazakh minority, we can probably expect them to agree on a peaceful rejoining with the Kazakh SSR."

Like its predecessor, it was weak, divided. Now history repeats itself. Its democracy, with its delusion of political parties and partisan division, has, under historical precedence, crumbled to socialism.\n\nHowever, the administration finds its grasp over its populace tenuous. To remedy this, our civic planners look toward reaching out to the remnants of the Social Democrats. By blending them to a socialist party structure and ensuring their subservience to us, we can exert some more political control over the territory. Though social democracy is a failed ideology, we can use it to gently turn the people of Pavlodar from rivals and enemies to comrades marching under one banner."

Although Lenin, in his wisdom, decided to bypass this stage during the formative years of the Union, and Bukharin's failure to balance a capitalist economy with socialist control, Marx's proclamation could still find its realization in Pavlodar.\n\nIn the years following the terror bombing campaign, the government of Pavlodar has fostered a bustling and prosperous private sector. The administration shall collectivize this, seizing and buying these companies before turning them over to the state-owned institutions.

Private companies pour this black gold unto barrels, before shipping them off to the highest bidder.\n\nPavlodar has come under socialism, at last, and the administration now possesses this valuable asset. To further the extraction of it, the economic planners have recommended for collectivization to cover these companies. We shall strip their rights to mine and refine oil, placing their facilities and engineers under the ownership of the state.

The high command has agreed to send troops to protect convoys and to implement patrol schedules along the roads. They will also dispatch scouts to note the hideouts of these pests.

Even with the Soviet power reestablished in the city and the countryside, the people of Kokshetau live without any feeling of confidence in their safety from bandit attacks.\n\nThe war on criminals in Kokshetau has not ended, but it took a different, subtler form.

Their eyes regard us with suspicion, and their arms are slow to embrace us as their comrades and saviors. To them, socialism is another ideology out to exploit them.\n\nTo convince them, words are no longer enough. We shall go one step further. We shall build roads, schools, and factories on Kokshetau. They shall have their education, and no more shall its children be illiterate. Its workers will have their right to work, staffing the factory floors, and paving the roads that span its lands.

Once, before the collapse, they were steadfast comrades, a pillar of the old Kazakh SSR.\n\nRather than immediately force them to recant their faith at gunpoint, we will extend the olive branch and attempt to deradicalize them. We will drive the radical and fundamentalist imams out of their mosques, replacing them with more moderate ones. These will preach peace and reconciliation, starting a long and arduous process.

Even after the obscurantist Islamic regime fell, those vile mullahs and imams still attempt to covertly oppose our rule and are trying to spread their anti-Soviet slander in their mosques all over the Soviet Republic, believing that they are immune to any secular law within their houses of false worship.\n\nThe previous Soviet government tolerated their presence and allowed Kazakh priests to live in their ignorance to some extent, but we can not afford such leniency against the sworn enemies of any enlightenment and worker's morals.

This system is an artifact of older ages, to immerse the masses of the world in opiate, blissfully unaware of their oppression at the hands of the bourgeoisie.\n\nWe shall implement a new curriculum for the region of Kostanay. The architects and planners will plan the construction of schools throughout the region.

The solution must be twofold: both with force and with a light hand shall we convince the people of Khromtau to join the socialist revolution.\n\nThe administration will send its troops to Khromtau to keep the peace there, securing the roads and grazing grounds frequented by the sheepherders and civilians alike.

During Onoprienko's reign, he forced many of the miners to endure long work hours to produce more and more ores in the name of National Renewal. With his defeat, the administration now controls most of the mining pits.\n\nThe first step towards revitalizing the Chromium mining industry is to free the miners previously conscripted by the National Renewal junta. Next, the administration will entice them to work again in the mines in exchange for shorter work hours and a more friendly work environment.

Beyond its borders, the world still looms overhead, but we are not afraid.\n\nBut first things first: the lands of the National Renewal Front and Nowa Polska stand empty without any structure of bureaucracy over them. The administration would like to rectify this situation immediately.
