 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_DESC:0 "Vitaly Semenovich Kostin was, until recently, a nobody. He was born in 1938, in a small settlement in the Altai, and from a young age quickly became involved in mining. After a brief period of serving in the Central Siberian Republic's army, where he was a first-hand witness of its unravelling and final collapse, he found himself in Novosibirsk, poised to continue his career. Kostin lacked the adhesion others had to the regime's beliefs, and despite the rumours of connections with the underground socialist-populist "Narodnik" group, he became an exemplary worker. The miner was of no particular relevance to the politics of the Russian warlords - until the revolt begun.\n\nDetermined to make a last stand against the resurgent authorities in Central Siberia, the working class of its cities and villages took up arms against their perceived oppressors. News of checkpoint after checkpoint being taken over by ragtag militias arrived to the rulers of the region, and it seemed as effective control of it seemed to be slipping away once again. At the head of this grand uprising was Kostin, who did not lose the chance to guide the proletariat to victory.\n\nYet, as much as the once normal citizen has become the figurehead of this liberation movement, he is not its King, President or Supreme Leader. A form of libertarian socialism has emerged in liberated communities, and there is no sole leader in such a system. All Vitaly Kostin wants is for his people to be free and equal, and if all out revolution is what it will take, all out revolution it shall be."

 POLITICS_IVAN_SEVASTYANOV_DESC:0 "Ivan Pavlovich Sevastyanov first became known in Central Siberia for his important work in the late stages of the Siberian Plan. As a young engineer and former CPSU official, he helped steer the project in the right direction, and ensured that it was successful and had the long-term effects it had.\n\nHis sympathy to Bolshevik ideals was known, but due to his usefulness and skill, was largely ignored until the Workers' Federation swept through the region, and Sevastyanov grabbed the chance to declare a reformed socialist republic covering territories he knew all too well. Contrarily to his allies, he has taken a different approach to his rule, giving power to the Soviets and forming a strong executive authority around him.\n\nIt has been effective, as tremendous economic growth was soon noticed, and more focus is put on the industry than ever. Of all the new states founded between Omsk and Irkutsk, Sevastyanov's one could be said to be the one closest to the old USSR."

 POLITICS_MARIA_BORCHENKO_DESC:0 "Maria Yakovlevna Borchenko may have become the honorary leader of the Siberian Workers' and Peasants' Union, but only a few years ago no one would have guessed that a humble farmer could have become a rising star in the socialist sphere in Central Siberia.\n\nShe was born in a village of the Altai plateau, and worked in farms throughout the rule of Bukharin, the CSR and the Federation. It did not take long until her admiration of socialism drew her close to Narodnik circles, where she argued for the rights of the neglected peasants.\n\nHer time to shine came, later, though, as with the region in open revolt, she rallied the people of Altai into a separate rebellion. Thus, the Workers' and Peasants' Union was created: a peaceful state formed by the lower class, for the lower class. Maria may be its leader, but in her eyes the true control rests in the people, those working hard in the factories and farms."

 POLITICS_YURI_GALANSKOV_DESC:0 "The fascinating experiment of the Siberian Black Army has left a long-lasting stain on the region, and that is made clear by the existence of the Free Workers' Republic of Siberia. Headed by the SBA's leading ideologue, Yuri Timofeyevich Galanskov, it has taken much inspiration from the former Army whose territory the Republic now occupies.\n\nAfter the recent events, the brave anarchist of Tulun reformed his theory of militarized anarchy, and now claims to practice the doctrine of the People's Fight, the protracted armed struggle of a rural population against its enemies for the maintenance of the "free territory".\n\nLittle is known about how Yuri took this ideological turn, but the beliefs of fellow socialists in Central Siberia have had a profound effect on his own. And while he may have never been a man of books or in-depth theory, but his ideas have definitely reached the hearts and minds of the local population."

 KAL_do_no_harm_desc:0 "One of the founding tenets of our Union is that no man may strike another man, nor may women strike women. Our people have seen enough violence, blood, and death for a thousand life times, and we wish only to live in peace. Unlike our forefathers, here the peasant will not suffer under the yoke of the lord.\n\nOf course, we will defend ourselves if those who wish to destroy our peaceful life dare cross our borders."
 KAL_strength_in_diversity_desc:0 "We are a Union of many faiths and cultures. Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Jewish - all are welcome, as long as they work their share. Though tension between groups may fester at times, overall, the Union is a land free of the chauvinism that has plagued humanity for so long."

The remnants of the Siberian Plan offer many a worker respite in these trying times, and, should the worse come to pass, our factories will churn out many a rifle. More than this, perhaps some day in the future, our workers will be able to take full advantage of our industry to better themselves and their work. Communism may yet be achieved here in the Siberian Wastes, all thanks to Bukharin's legacy."

 KAL_arise_ye_workers_from_your_slumbers_desc:0 "'Comrades,\n\nWords are for the weak, for those incapable of actions. No matter how pretty the words on a sheet of paper may be, they are nothing in comparison to the actions that an individual may or may not take. And it is the leaders who speak and speak and speak, endlessly and endlessly, droning on like robots. Meanwhile, their actions are based upon the exploitation of the working class. They use the police and the army to subjugate you, all while promising a better future.\n\nBut they must understand that we, too, are capable of action. The workers of this nation, and their allies, can stop the wheels of industry, production, and so on, just by doing nothing. We can stop the war machine of this dreadful enemy in its tracks. And for those who desire more than that, you have the greatest ally of the working class in your homes: the family rifle, of which your prey is no longer an animal but an enemy of your people.\n\nTo the workers of Siberia, I ask of you: stand up, and fight! Fight for freedom and liberty as workers of the world!'"
 KAL_arise_ye_prisoners_of_want_desc:0 "'Comrades,\n\nTo fight this war, you must first and foremost understand that this is a different type of war than the ones you or your fathers fought. It is not a war of large armies, fighting with consistent and important supply lines, or even one in which our soldiers are of the same quality in equipment and training. If we think of this as similar to the Great Patriotic War, we will have lost it before we have even begun.\n\nRather, comrades, it is important to think of yourselves and your brigade as cells, all making up distinct portions of a greater whole. You work independently of one another, cooperating when need be, but, fundamentally, working alone, distinct and unique in their purpose and make up. To fight a war like this you will pounce upon the slightest sign of weakness of our enemies.\n\nIt is one thing to fight against an enemy head on. It is something quite different to fight like a thousand stinging ants, breaking their will to fight before they even fight us.'"
 KAL_reason_in_revolt_desc:0 "'GENERAL NOTICE TO ALL WORKERS BATTALIONS\n\nTo those brave workers fighting against tyranny, it is important to understand that we are surrounded on all sides by enemies. We do not have the factories to produce significant amount of guns for our men, , and nor do we have the infrastructure to produce such factories even if we wished to.\n\nThat is why it is important to make friends where we can. It is not the fault of a single peasant or soldier for the circumstances they find themselves under, but those who would use nationalism and religion to suppress their class consciousness. A peasant makes food, for which can be used to feed our men. An enemy soldier is another potential ally, with access to weaponry and tactics we do have.\n\nThat is why I, Kostin, stand against the recent tendency among fellow socialists to blame the current regime on civilian peasants.. While entitled to their opinion, it is irrational to start making enemies where none existed before.'"
 KAL_on_tyrants_only_well_make_war_desc:0 "Historical Document-S1451 -- Anarchist Leaflet against Rightist forces in Russia, directed towards workers in Krasnoyarsk:\n\n"COMRADES,\n\nIt is said by many so called 'moderates' that the parties in charge of the current state of affairs, while far from perfect, are 'better than nothing' and 'better than the Warlordism of the past'.\n\nThat very well may be true, but consider this: are you willing to accept that? Are you, the workers of this great nation, willing to sit down and allow tyrants to take over, simply because they keep the trains running on time?\n\nAre you willing to accept the destruction of your unions before the powerful bosses? Are you willing to allow your rights as workers be undermined by the Union Bosses who care more for power than your right to the sweat of your brow?\n\nThe so called moderates are traitors and enemies of your class! They are the ones who stand in the way of true freedom!\n\nJOIN THE WORKERS' FEDERATION\n\nKOSTIN, THE NEW CINCINNATUS"
 KAL_comrades_come_rally_desc:0 "'Comrades,\n\nDespite the lies of the moderates and right wingers, we are not against you soldiers personally. You are but victims in the greater war between capitalists and against socialists. They are tools, to be used and disposed of as quickly as soon as they are no longer useful.\n\nWe believe that you are capable of rescuing yourself as enemies of the revolution, capable of looking past the base nationalism that these capitalists have instilled in you. You can turn your weapons of destruction against the capitalist and his allies, in defense of the working class of this nation and abroad, and join us, for the liberation of all mankind from the destruction of the capitalist class.'"
 KAL_spurn_the_dust_desc:0 "Letter from Kostin to an unknown General in the Workers Federation:\n\n'As I write this, revolutionary terror spreads across the land. It is done in the name of our movement, in the name of liberty. No matter how much I order them to stop, I continue to hear reports of men in ragged uniforms, burning down so called 'reactionary' towns, lynching city elders and religious peasants who refuse to bow down before our rule. The damned monsters are going to destroy our movement, no matter how hard I try to stop them from destroying what we have.'\n\nI feel helpless.'"
 KAL_no_more_deluded_by_reaction_desc:0 "'A church is but a haven of the reactionary and the deluded. Besides, if God truly controls everything, who are we to stop His Eternal and All Knowing Will?' \n-- Kirdin the Terrible. Known for personally killing up to two hundred members of the Orthodox Church, and ordering the destruction of fifty Churches.\n\nDespite attempts by Kostin and many within the Workers' Federation, the destruction of churches could not be stopped, due to the radicalism of generals more concerned with destroying holy relics than in attempting to gain the trust of the peasants.\n\nMany wonder whether the aftershocks can ever truly be healed. "
 KAL_each_at_the_forge_must_do_their_duty_desc:0 "WORDS FROM COMRADE KOSTIN\n\nWorkers of the revolution, you have been eternally faithful to the revolution of freedom and liberty. However, let it be known that there is no such thing as too much productivity. With the enemy still in control of massive amounts of industry, we are at a disadvantage in almost every regard.\n\nThis does not mean defeat. Rather, it is an opportunity! It is an opportunity to fully take advantage of the power of human ingenuity outside of capitalism. Workers of the Federation, you and your capacity are not limited by the profit drive of capitalism. You can explore not and innovative ways of increasing production, to create new methods to get weapons out in faster and more efficient ways.\n\nTo the Workers, you are the first line of defense against capitalism! Death to fascism, and long live freedom!'"
 KAL_strike_while_the_iron_is_hot_desc:0 "An enemy must be hit where they are weakest. To strike at the core territories would be a fool's errand, and would be the most fortified of all other potential areas. It would be a waste of manpower and resources, not to mention make us seem weak in the process.\n\nRather, we shall attack those on the fringes, the places where the memories of subjugation and prior leaders are still fresh in their minds. We shall find allies there, even if they may not be our friends. In addition, local bureaucrats of the core will find resisting us difficult, especially if they find the trust among the natives lacking."
 KAL_unite_the_human_race_desc:0 "'Comrades,\n\nSocialism is, first and foremost, about the fundamental axiom that all men are entitled to the same basic right to life. They are all entitled to food, shelter, medicine, and so on. But while socially progressive, we have denied to those the same freedom as us: to work for the greater common good.\n\nThat ends now. All people, regardless of age and sex, are capable of defending their fellow man and the revolution. We believe in equality, and so it is time we began acting like we did.\n\nAll individuals who deny their fellow man the right to fight considers social reaction more important the revolution.'"
 KAL_the_last_figh_desc:0 "Excerpt from Speech by Kostin to a Worker's Battalion:\n\n"Comrades, listen to me: the enemy is preparing for the final battle. The capitalists are working their wage-slaves to the bone, the generals drilling their men into a blood frenzy, and the papers are spreading lies about the so-called 'revolutionary terror". They are ready to destroy us.\n\nBut we have not been idle, friends. We, too, have been preparing for the assault they plan to unleash upon us. We have placed a gun in every able body man and woman in our Federation, making any victory they lay upon us a bitter one indeed.\n\nEvery one of our cities is a fortress from which only the atom bomb itself can drive us from, and even then only barely. We welcome their challenge. I, for one, am willing to die for the revolution -- as every good socialist is. Our sacrifice is but just one more chain in the long march of history. We will be remembered as heroes, comrades. And nothing they can do can stop that.""

 ## Events ##
 
 kostin.1.t:0 "The Coming Storm"
 kostin.1.d:0 "In the frenzied push to reunify Siberia and restore it to rightful dignity, a whisper has grown. As the light has gained purchase, so too has our shadow. Festering upon the inherent cruelty in our actions, it has waited for a moment to strike. Today, it emerged from the dark, boldly declaring "I was, I am, I will be!"\n\nWorkers across the central Siberian industrial zones have begun a massive coordinated general strike! Citing continually poor conditions, unfulfilled promises, and unrepentant cruelty by bosses.\n\nIt appears the drive to return civilization to the Russian wastes has come with many drawbacks, as the lofty dream of a united Russia becomes less alluring when one cannot feed his family or keep all his limbs intact. Additionally, with the return of normalcy to the region, the worker himself seems to have become less valuable; simply a pawn towards the eventual goal.\n\nAlready, work has ground to a halt, demands are being made, and old scores are being settled. While some in our government may be sympathetic to the cause of the strikers, it is undeniable that we cannot tolerate a crippled economy, especially considering the always precarious position of Russia. The strikers are numerous and militant. Unless we can come to some kind of deal, and show our workers some tangible piece of the prosperity we promise, we must brace for the storm to come."
 kostin.1.a:0 "Harrowing..."

 kostin.3.t:0 "The Eyewall"
 kostin.3.d:0 "The severity of this general strike has expanded into entirely new dimensions! Following a lack of progress towards any kind of resolution, and continuous violence, the workers have taken up arms! Raiding weapon's stockpiles, looting old cellars, and outright stealing has become widespread, as arms and ammunition begin to be passed amongst militants. Already workers are organizing themselves into "General defense committees."\n\nThis is an extremely dangerous situation, and the spectre of uprising hangs in the air. We must tread more carefully then we ever have before, while at the same time moving as quickly as possible to secure ourselves.\n\nIf we do not act, this could be the end of all things..."
 kostin.3.a:0 "Bastards!"

 kostin.4.t:0 "Call for Uprising"
 kostin.4.d:0 "Comrades,\n\nUnlike the assholes that run Siberia, I will not lie to you. The truth is simple; so simple I don't need any fancy language to explain it to you. It is a truth any Russian child knows.\n\nThere is something wrong with those that lead.\n\nYou all know the kind of men I am talking about. Those that promise safety, promise prosperity, promise...ah what don't they promise? They have been doing it since even before the Great Patriotic War. Now, when our country lies in ruins, and our people scrounge in the dirt, what action do our leaders take?\n\nThey promise!\n\nI for one, am sick of the promises, sick of the lies, sick of the barbarism. So right here, right now, I am going to be honest with you. I am not your leader, and I never intend to be. I am simply a man, as you are, who wishes for the cruelty to stop.\n\nWe have an opportunity now to forge a new Russia, one where each man truly is equal. One without leaders. To get it, we will have to fight. However, the men of central Siberia have nothing to lose. It is we who keep production flowing, us who ensures their bullets, bread, and steel arrive on time.\n\nIn the name of all the dead children, all the widows, all the crippled sons. To hell with their promises!"
 kostin.4.a:0 "Can you all just calm down?!?"

 kostin.5.t:0 "The Revolt of Novosibirsk"
 kostin.5.d:0 "Harrowing news has been relayed from Novosibirsk. From what little information we can gather, there seems to be armed fighting underway in the city, led by the same workers who have been on strike for weeks, protesting for fairer wages and treatment. Unfortunately, It seems that their dissatisfaction with the current situation has reached a breaking point, with shouts transforming into the roaring embers of revolution.\n\nFortunately for us, support for this "Workers' Revolt" appears to be few and far between, and their glorified militia looks to be more of a mob than an army. Nevertheless, these armed militias still control the industrial capacity and the large population centered in Novosibirsk. We should treat this rapidly escalating situation with caution."
 kostin.5.a:0 "Are there not more important issues in the city?"

 kostin.6.t:0 "The Revolt of Krasnoyarsk"
 kostin.6.d:0 "Distressing News has been filtered from Krasnoyarsk. The few army units still residing in the city have reported that the once striking workers have turned violent and have occupied the streets of Krasnoyarsk in open revolt. As we speak, the armories in Krasnoyarsk are being looted of their weaponry, with heavy fighting raging in the city. Thankfully, while indeed worrying, the workers participating in this revolt seem to be woefully unprepared for a revolution, and support for the revolt is limited to the city itself.\n\nRegardless, these revolting workers control the large industry and population centered in Krasnoyarsk. If we do not deal with the situation at hand soon, the flickering embers of revolution may become a roaring fire. "
 kostin.6.a:0 "First it was a mutiny. Then, it was a revolution."

 kostin.7.t:0 "The Revolt of Tomsk"
 kostin.7.d:0 "Following days of effectively no contact with the city of Tomsk, it seems the worse has come to pass. The workers on strike in the city itself have taken up arms, and have instigated a full-fledged revolt. Even aided by a small but noticeable amount of intellectuals residing in Tomsk, the fires of revolution are rapidly burning in the city of intellectuals, with our efforts in quelling this dissent proving to be fruitless.\n\nLuckily, the forces of this "workers' revolt" appear to enjoy very little support in Tomsk, with many of the intellectuals in the city recalling their persecution during the old Soviet era. With the might of our army, the fires of this pitiful "worker's revolt" will be smothered into ashes."
 kostin.7.a:0 "The City of Intellectuals turns into the City of Revolutionaries."

 kostin.8.t:0 "The Revolt of Novosibirsk"
 kostin.8.d:0 "The state of affairs in Novosibirsk and it's surrounding territories has reached a breaking point, it seems, for the fires of revolution are now bursting in the region. Following our subsequent attempts to calm the striking workers of Novosibirsk, the aforementioned workers appear to have reached their limit and have broken out in open revolt. Distressing news by itself, it is further compounded by the fact that the outlying territories around Novosibirsk and the city itself encompass major industrial capacity and a large population.\n\nAn increasingly major threat to our new nation, this "workers' revolt" only continues to grow stronger every day. We must extinguish the flames of revolution before it is too late."
 kostin.8.a:0 "Just when you thought the problems in Novosibirsk couldn't get any worse..."

 kostin.9.t:0 "The Revolt of Krasnoyarsk"
 kostin.9.d:0 "The worst has come to pass in Krasnoyarsk, it seems, for the city is in open revolt. Believing that their pleas for worker rights are being directly ignored, the socialist agitators in Krasnoyarsk have risen up. Worse still, some outlying territories have been inspired by this senseless revolt and have done the same in solidarity.\n\nIf the situation is not grim enough, it has been further exacerbated by the traitorous revolters seizing major industries in the city of Krasnoyarsk. Furthermore, many in the population support these revolters, and we can only assume their numbers swelling in the coming months. The future of our new nation is at stake, and if we do not disperse these revolting workers and end their foolish revolt, it can only end in disaster for us."
 kostin.9.a:0 "Is it possible for the city to stop revolting?"

 kostin.10.t:0 "The Revolt of Tomsk"
 kostin.10.d:0 "Dire news has been received from the city of Tomsk, for the fires of revolution now reside in the city. Following innumerable days of needless strikes, the discontent strikers appear to have abandoned any hopes for a peaceful resolution and have taken to the streets with arms stolen from the local armory. Worse still, with support moderately widespread, some outlying territories surrounding Tomsk have also risen up in solidarity, with a few of the intellectuals in the city itself even joining the revolt, being up with arms with the actions of our new state.\n\nWith the future of our new nation at a precipice, many are also beginning to question the effectiveness of our rule. If this so-called "workers' revolt" is not quelled, it will only mean disaster for our new state."
 kostin.10.a:0 "Revolution has painted the City of intellectuals a coat of red."

Based in [KAL.Capital.GetName], and led by the previously insignificant foreman Vitaly Kostin, the workers of Central Siberia have launched their final stand against the changing tides. There will be no backroom deal, no frenzied negotiations, and no respite.

 kostin.14.t:0 "Proclamation of the Worker's Federation"
 kostin.14.d:0 "In the former domain of the Rus pretender, red flags fly proudly and strongly, as the entirety of central Siberia is proclaimed a workers state. Already, symbols of the old regime are being taken down and replaced by those of socialism and the Russian worker's movement as a whole. Vitaly Kostin, a mining labour leader and head of the worker's revolt, addressed a crowd in the former of Kemerovo, stating that 'the reign of the mad king has been relegated to the dustbin of history.'\n\nAlthough the streets and towns of the federation are revelling in their jubilance, the future of the worker's state is by no means clear or straight forward. Russia is still a mess of warring factions and raiding, and if the federation wishes to survive, it will have to contend with this."
 kostin.14.a:0 "Let's see what is to become of the Siberian workers."

 kostin.15.t:0 "Tough Crowd"
 kostin.15.d:0 "This was the proudest moment in Vitaly Kostin's life. Just a year ago, he was a lowly worker in the labyrinthine industrial complexes that strangled the basin of Central Siberia. Now, he stood before the men and women of the first Worker's Congress of the Siberian Worker's Federation. Kostin was to baptize his newly created nation; that which was born in the fires of his revolution.\n\n"Brothers! Sisters! COMRADES! I formally welcome you to our first Worker's Congress!" His opening was met with an overwhelming roar of cheers and applause.\n\n"Today we shall create a federation which is founded by the worker, for the worker! A place where the working class shall hold the reins of power, and not those greedy bureaucrats who grow fat off the fruit of our labor! A new sort of society shall arise in our federation: guided by the might of the unions!" This time, there was noticeably less applause. Kostin felt a shiver down his spine. Was it something he said?\n\n"Yes, indeed. For too long have we been oppressed by those who have never worked a day in their lives. The working men of the unions shall form the bedrock of an entirely new kind of civilization. Merit, not birth, shall determine your standing in our society!"\n\nDead silence. Kostin broke out into a cold sweat. They clearly did not like what they were hearing. In the back of the crowd, he could see some of his comrades beginning to leave the building. "Yes, well, any questions before we proceed, comrades?"\n\n"Oh, where the hell do I even begin?!" Someone shouted from the back. The crowd began to jeer in agreement."
 kostin.15.a:0 "What the hell was he thinking?!"

 kostin.16.t:0 "Splitters!"
 kostin.16.d:0 "It seems that Comrade Kostin's little debacle at the Worker's Congress not long ago has had serious ramifications. Ever since his voicing of ideas that have been accused of advocating for "labor aristocracy", there have been worrying reports of mutiny amongst the militias. The truth is far worse: they had thrown their weight behind a faction of splitters!\n\nLed by Ivan Sevastyanov, these separatists have seized control over Krasnoyarsk and the surrounding states, and have proclaimed the formation of the "Reformed Siberian Socialist Worker's Republic". They have gone so far as to denounce Kostin as a tyrant, and refuse to acknowledge the federation's authority!\n\nDespite this clear betrayal of the revolution, we are unable to mount a proper response to this disaster, for large portions of the militias are still mutinous and refusing orders. It seems likely that this secession is merely the start of our woes..."
 kostin.16.a:0 "This can't be happening!"
 
 kostin.17.t:0 "More Secessions!"
 kostin.17.d:0 "Disaster! Despite the shock of Sevastyanov's misguided succession from the federation, it seems that our troubles are not nearly over. Following further mutinies of the army, a new state has arisen in the chaos that followed Kostin's fall from grace. Just like before, they refuse to acknowledge our authority and assert themselves as an independent entity!\n\nKnown as the "Siberian Workers and Peasants Union", this new group of separatists is led by Maria Borchenko. She was among the most vocal of Kostin's critics following the disastrous Worker's Congress, and her betrayal is not entirely unexpected. Still, this is yet another major blow to the Siberian revolution. What little troops we still have are paralyzed, and unable to reassert our authority over the newly independent territories."
 kostin.17.a:0 "No, wait! Come back!"

 kostin.18.t:0 "The Militias Rise!"
 kostin.18.d:0 "Yet another calamity has befallen our young federation! The militias, paralyzed by the unrest caused by Kostin's eccentricities, have finally made their move. Unfortunately, it is not a move that goes in our favor.\n\nSupported by the remnants of the Siberian Black Army, a new separatist faction has emerged from our rapidly disintegrating regime. Led by former Black Army leader Yuri Galanskov, this newly created "Free Worker's Republic of Siberia" has laid claim to a large portion of our remaining territories, and has boldly denounced Kostin as a traitor to the revolution.\n\nWith the defection of the majority of our militias, we are left with very little to stop any further potential secessions. Only time will tell if our federation will even survive to see the end of the week..."
 kostin.18.a:0 "Jackals! Vultures!"

 kostin.19.t:0 "The Dust Settles"
 kostin.19.d:0 "One speech. One speech was all it took to undo all of Vitaly Kostin's triumphs. Against all the odds, Kostin had gone from a humble miner in Altay to the leader of a fiery worker's revolution. Nobody thought he could do it, of course, for his enemies were simply too strong. Despite all of the naysayers and defeatists, Kostin and his comrades defied expectation and liberated the long-oppressed workers of Siberia.\n\nYet, despite the miraculous nature of Kostin's victory, it was simply not to last. The Worker's Congress was supposed to be the finale to a long string of victories, the event that would cement Kostin's place in history as a great liberator of the working class. Instead, it was a poorly-planned disaster that resulted in Kostin going from hero to class traitor virtually overnight.\n\nKostin was never one for words. He was a blue-collar working man, after all, not a poet or a politician. Speeches were certainly not his strong suit, and the debacle at the congress was proof of that. Kostin himself only wanted what was best for the workers, even if he wasn't the best at explaining how.\n\nRegardless, the damage was done. Three separate nations had split from Kostin's federation in protest of his unfortunate speech, and Central Siberia was now just as divided as it was at the turn of the decade. Nearly as soon as it began, Kostin's revolution was ground into dust.\n\nAlthough he only controlled a quarter of the Worker's Federation's former territories, the humble Kostin remained determined to make the best of his unfortunate situation; following the ideals that ignited his revolution as best he could."
