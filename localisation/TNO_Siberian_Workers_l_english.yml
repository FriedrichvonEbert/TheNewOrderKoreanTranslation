 ## Country Leaders ##
 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_DESC:0 "Vitaly Semenovich Kostin was, until recently, a nobody. He was born in 1938, in a small settlement in the Altai, and from a young age quickly became involved in mining. After a brief period of serving in the Central Siberian Republic's army, where he was a first-hand witness of its unravelling and final collapse, he found himself in Novosibirsk, poised to continue his career. Kostin lacked the adhesion others had to the regime's beliefs, and despite the rumours of connections with the underground socialist-populist "Narodnik" group, he became an exemplary worker. The miner was of no particular relevance to the politics of the Russian warlords - until the revolt begun.\n\nDetermined to make a last stand against the resurgent authorities in Central Siberia, the working class of its cities and villages took up arms against their perceived oppressors. News of checkpoint after checkpoint being taken over by ragtag militias arrived to the rulers of the region, and it seemed as effective control of it seemed to be slipping away once again. At the head of this grand uprising was Kostin, who did not lose the chance to guide the proletariat to victory.\n\nYet, as much as the once normal citizen has become the figurehead of this liberation movement, he is not its King, President or Supreme Leader. A form of libertarian socialism has emerged in liberated communities, and there is no sole leader in such a system. All Vitaly Kostin wants is for his people to be free and equal, and if all out revolution is what it will take, all out revolution it shall be."

 POLITICS_IVAN_SEVASTYANOV_DESC:0 "Ivan Pavlovich Sevastyanov first became known in Central Siberia for his important work in the late stages of the Siberian Plan. As a young engineer and former CPSU official, he helped steer the project in the right direction, and ensured that it was successful and had the long-term effects it had.\n\nHis sympathy to Bolshevik ideals was known, but due to his usefulness and skill, was largely ignored until the Workers' Federation swept through the region, and Sevastyanov grabbed the chance to declare a reformed socialist republic covering territories he knew all too well. Contrarily to his allies, he has taken a different approach to his rule, giving power to the Soviets and forming a strong executive authority around him.\n\nIt has been effective, as tremendous economic growth was soon noticed, and more focus is put on the industry than ever. Of all the new states founded between Omsk and Irkutsk, Sevastyanov's one could be said to be the one closest to the old USSR."

 POLITICS_MARIA_BORCHENKO_DESC:0 "Maria Yakovlevna Borchenko may have become the honorary leader of the Siberian Workers' and Peasants' Union, but only a few years ago no one would have guessed that a humble farmer could have become a rising star in the socialist sphere in Central Siberia.\n\nShe was born in a village of the Altai plateau, and worked in farms throughout the rule of Bukharin, the CSR and the Federation. It did not take long until her admiration of socialism drew her close to Narodnik circles, where she argued for the rights of the neglected peasants.\n\nHer time to shine came, later, though, as with the region in open revolt, she rallied the people of Altai into a separate rebellion. Thus, the Workers' and Peasants' Union was created: a peaceful state formed by the lower class, for the lower class. Maria may be its leader, but in her eyes the true control rests in the people, those working hard in the factories and farms."

 POLITICS_LEV_KRASNOPEVTSEV_DESC:0 "The fascinating experiment of the Siberian Black Army has left a long-lasting stain on the region, and that is made clear by the existence of the Free Workers' Republic of Siberia. Headed by the SBA's leading ideologue, Lev Nikolayevich Krasnopevtsev, it has taken much inspiration from the former Army whose territory the Republic now occupies.\n\nAfter the recent events, the brave anarchist of Tulun reformed his theory of militarized anarchy, and now claims to practice the doctrine of the People's Fight, the protracted armed struggle of a rural population against its enemies for the maintenance of the "free territory".\n\nLittle is known about how Lev took this ideological turn, but the beliefs of fellow socialists in Central Siberia have had a profound effect on his own. And while he may have never been a man of books or in-depth theory, but his ideas have definitely reached the hearts and minds of the local population."

 KAL_industrialist_tendencies:0 "Industrialist Tendencies"

 KAL_do_no_harm_desc:0 "One of the founding tenets of our Union is that no man may strike another man, nor may women strike women. Our people have seen enough violence, blood, and death for a thousand life times, and we wish only to live in peace. Unlike our forefathers, here the peasant will not suffer under the yoke of the lord.\n\nOf course, we will defend ourselves if those who wish to destroy our peaceful life dare cross our borders."
 KAL_strength_in_diversity_desc:0 "We are a Union of many faiths and cultures. Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Jewish - all are welcome, as long as they work their share. Though tension between groups may fester at times, overall, the Union is a land free of the chauvinism that has plagued humanity for so long."
 KAL_all_power_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "The Soviet is the central organ of our statelet - every decision is made through their consensus. While an inefficient model, this brand of democratic centralism has served us well since the collapse of the Federation."
 KAL_industrialist_tendencies_desc:0 "Our state's only means of survival lie in our industry. The remnants of the Siberian Plan offer many a worker respite in these trying times, and, should the worse come to pass, our factories will churn out many a rifle. More than this, perhaps some day in the future, our workers will be able to take full advantage of our industry to better themselves and their work. Communism may yet be achieved here in the Siberian Wastes, all thanks to Bukharin's legacy."
