RND.1.t:0 "The First Report"
RND.1.d:0 "TO: Führer Albert Speer\n\nFROM: Präsident Reinhard Gehlen\n\nSUBJECT: Special Operations\n\nMein Führer,\n\nAs per your orders, I have compiled a list of potential targets for any potential actions. While these targets may not be your top threats, they are the ones we are currently able to handle without sparking suspicion. I trust that you will deem these candidates as acceptable losses to protect your position. Each of these targets, if not dealt with swiftly and decisively, could use their knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET ONE: Karl Brandt, administrator of the Aktion T4 euthanasia program. Has close knowledge of your involvement in the Aktion T4 program- could use against you. NOTE: Despite your close personal connection to Herr Brandt, he poses a great danger to the security of your regime, particularly your support among the reformists.\n\nTARGET TWO: Karl Hanke, Gauleiter of Lower Silesia. Recommended you to Herr Goebbels, initiating your rise in the party. Knows of many of your controversial acts- very dangerous. RND sources indicate ties to SS-Ordenstaat Burgund. NOTE: Once again, despite your close connections, Hanke possesses a great threat to your power and influence, and may use his knowledge against you.\n\nTARGET THREE: Hans Kammler, engineer. Noted for his work on the V-2 Rocket. Once a subordinate of yours. Knows of your previous usage of and position on slaves. No personal connections- could leverage knowledge against you.\n\nOnce again, each of these men holds a sword of Damocles over you and your Fuhrership, and may drop it at any time. The longer we wait to deal with these issues, the more likely it is that one leverages their knowledge against you. I highly recommend immediate action.\n\nYours, Präsident Reinhard Gehlen."

RND.2.t:0 "The Funeral of Karl Brandt"
RND.2.d:0 "Speer paused for a moment, tears welling in his eyes. The small crowd hung onto his every motion as if they were glued to him. Finally, after a moment to collect himself, Speer began.\n\n"I'm heartbroken, absolutely heartbroken, to be here today, mourning the passing of one of my oldest friends. Karl Brandt was a good man. He was a man dedicated to science and medicine, and he was one of my closest friends back in the day. Though we may have drifted apart as time went on, the bond that was shared between us never died, and I could not possibly express my full grief at his untimely passing. That an automobile accident struck down such a gem of our Reich serves as a terrible reminder that all of us are merely human, and must treasure and cherish our days on Earth. . ."\n\nHowever, if Karl Brandt, currently resting peacefully in his coffin, could speak instead of Speer, his story would have been vastly different than the eulogy that the Führer gave. Perhaps he would have regaled the audience with how, while he was returning from work, a truck veered out in front of him, forcing him off the road at high speeds. He may have emphasized how, while he was dazed and stunned by the crash, multiple RND men surrounded his vehicle. He certainly would have screamed about how the man in front of the wreck, noticing how Brandt still moved, drew his pistol and put one bullet directly through Brandt's skull. Brandt would have closed his tale on the fire, set by those same men that killed him, that engulfed the car and destroyed the evidence that they had ever been involved.\n\nBut Karl Brandt was dead, and so the crowd gave a standing ovation to their Führer as he concluded, not even suspecting the truth behind the untimely death of Karl Brandt."
RND.2.a:0 "Adieu."

RND.3.t:0 "Karl Hanke Murdered!"
RND.3.d:0 "KATTOWITZ - Tragic news for the Reich's bureaucrats today as Karl Hanke, a personal friend of the Führer and decorated former Gauleiter of Silesia, has been murdered! The stalwart veteran of the NSDAP had been holidaying at a hunting lodge near Kattowitz with Silesian troops on leave, but failed to return from his evening walk last night. When the soldiers went out to search for him the following morning, they found Hanke lying unresponsive against a tree, with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. One of the Landsers, a medic, pronounced Hanke dead at the scene. A subsequent coroner's report found that Hanke had been dead for several hours before being discovered. More concerningly, it has been confirmed that Hanke was shot with a Polish submachine gun or pistol, casings from which were found nearby. Local Ordnungspolizei officers confirmed that a Polish terrorist cell had been active across the border with the General Government in recent years, and at least one member remained at large.\n\n"This is a terrible shock to me," said the Führer of Hanke's murder. "As many Party faithful know, it was Hanke's recommendation to the late Dr. Goebbels that began my career in the government. Not only do I owe him my position as Führer, but he was also a dear friend and confidant of many years. I hope with all my heart that our brave police officers and detectives can bring this case to a satisfying conclusion and enact justice for my friend and colleague."\n\nKarl Hanke had been a mildly controversial figure in recent years, owing to his long-standing support for the SS. He faced criticism at times from fellow NSDAP members for his political views, but was fully exonerated of alleged ties to treasonous elements by the Führer himself shortly after the Bürgerkrieg. Hanke is survived by his wife, Baroness Freda von Fircks, and their daughter."

RND.4.t:0 "A Tragic Report"
RND.4.d:0 "15:59 PM: Preparations for launch complete. Head Technician Tiedemann reported no anomalies in engine temperature. Fuel tank was at full capacity. No reports of unusual activity during engine tests. Security team confirmed that all non-essential personnel were off-base for the prototype's launch.\n\n16:02 PM: Director Kammler called down onto launch pad by unidentified technician. All on-base technicians later testified that, at the time, they were in the facility reception area "awaiting Kammler's arrival for launch".\n\n16:05 PM: Automatic alarm sounded, announcing initiation of experimental missile launch. Tiedemann informed me that Kammler had not returned from launch pad. Security personnel on guard later testified that nobody had entered the control room, which remained locked at the time.\n\n16:06 PM: Monitoring room staff reported temperature anomaly in missile engine. Evacuation order sounded.\n\n16:06:32 PM: Two security officers ordered to enter launch pad area to retrieve Director Kammler, who still had not returned. Officer Weissman refused and was relieved of duty. Officer Hartz attempted to enter launch pad, but found main entrance bulkhead sealed.\n\n16:07:05 PM: Missile ignition began, followed by immediate detonation of the missile itself. Catastrophic damage to silo resulted. No personnel unaccounted for besides Kammler.\n\n16:22 PM: Arrival of emergency team and Feldgendarmerie. Silo doors confirmed destroyed. Firefighter crew able to enter and douse all active fires.\n\n16:24 PM: Discovery of human remains, severely charred and beyond recognition at the time. Technician Tiedemann removed to local hospital due to psychological trauma.\n\n20:11 PM: Coroner confirms by dental records that the deceased was Director Kammler. Reich Chancellery and Abwehr notified. Following this, personal condolences transmitted to the Führer by facility personnel. Family of Kammler notified. Investigation of incident to proceed tomorrow, pending formal approval by OKW."

 RND.5.t:0 "RND Operation Failed"
 RND.5.desc:0 "It seems like our mission failed in its objective. Whether it was due to a lack of technological advancements, an underdeveloped budget, or an understaffed and untrained agency, the RND has lost some of its pride as an effective intelligence agency. The president is displeased to hear this news, though does not expect guaranteed success on every operation. The RND will recover, and it can only hope that it will succeed the next."
 RND.5.a:0 "The rest is in your hands, agent."

 RND.6.t:0 "RND Operation Thwarted"
 RND.6.desc:0 "The Reichsnachrichtendienst, translated as the Reich Intelligence Service, has infiltrated into our country with their agents. Thankfully, due to our own counter-espionage efforts, we have managed to negate their efforts almost completely. This should give our own agents some experience in dealing with hostile elements, as well as showing to us that perhaps a more closer eye should be kept on the Reich."

Estimated 28% of staff have been relocated back to Germany, replaced with our own RND agents. Regular contact with Japanese diplomats and other miscellaneous figures related to the Japanese nation. Suggested to wait until the situation has stabilized and we have determined that there is no possible way for the Japanese to find out that we are listening to them.\n\nBugging operations have begun - expected translators to come in soon. Once we've figured out more, the recommended next step is to infiltrate into the Japanese mainland. Risky operation, but the success of Singvogel has given us access to several possible landing destinations in various Japanese ports. More in pg. 1 to pg. 11.

Having successfully infiltrated agents into low-level positions, we have uncovered that the IJA is facing issues with massive discontent in its ranks. With powerful influence, it is at odds with the other branches of government, and threatens national stability. The situation seems unlikely to change for the time being.\n\nThe government is ineffective with giving a response. Discontent within seems to be rising with the current status quo. Future developments have no clear way of developing. Expected outcomes: Status quo resulting in decay of state power; purging of military, massive decline in stability; military continues to grow, political turmoil. Japan unlikely to recover from situation within the next few years. End of page.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

Operation has been confirmed as a set-up. Agents - currently numbering six - all have direct ties to the Schutzstaffel operating out of Ordensstaat-Burgund. Presumed to be veteran agents from before the Civil War. Information on source of income is weak. Primarily the United States financial sector, and (by far) secondarily direct funding from Himmler's clique.\n\nRecommended action is further pursuit of ties to the U.S financial sector. More specific information on where the agents get their funding will be found in pg. 4 to pg. 7. Agent profiles will be found in pg.1 to 6.

It seems like their source of funding was from shell companies masquerading as civilian businesses. State of profits is by a large margin, expected operation to continue for an undefined, but lengthy period of time, if nothing is to be done.\n\nWith this data we can extrapolate the following facts: Ordensstaat-Burgund is making a significant amount of wealth via siphoning money from foreign countries, using their agents to infiltrate with fake identification and pose as wealthy American businessmen. Expected to happen similarly in countries that have developed civilian industry. Japan, Canada, etc,. Advised to research into the Black State itself. End of page.\n\nMAY GERMANY BE IN SAFE HANDS."

 RND.12.t:0 "In All The World's Places"
 RND.12.desc:0 "Something unusual arrived in Boris Smylovsky's office - a letter. The man who gave him that envelope looked a bit confused, stating that he had received it from shady looking men who spoke Russian accented with... German. Something stirred in Smylovsky's heart when he heard that, but had the man motion to hand him the letter before leaving the office. Once he did that, he scanned every inch of it, and felt around the paper. Safe to open, he'd reckon. With some ripping and rustling, Boris pulled out a... letter, and immediately, at the bottom, he could spot a most familiar signature. His eyes widened, but he merely cleared his throat and began quietly reading the letter.\n\n"To Hauptmann von Regenau,-" He recognized it. That was his old nickname he used when conversing with Reinhard Gehlen, spymaster of Germany's RND, and an old friend of his. "May this letter find you with haste. I wish upon you good spirits, as we have not seen each other in a long time. Though I have no time for pleasantries - I must get right down to it. The Reich needs your help. My country may not appreciate it, but I will, and in time so will the people of Germany and Russia. I will send you aid and materials in the future, and I wish for you to use them at your disposal. If the Principality of Vyatka can prosper, then we can see to it that they are the ones that unify your people, and that there will be peace. I won't force you to follow my advice, but I hope that you shall, dear friend. We have done much for each other, but now I ask you for one final, grand favor. I only hope to repay it in the future.\n- Agent Kleiner Fuchs."\n\nBoris slowly set the letter down. He knew what he had to do. No matter the consequences, if nothing else, he would do it for the sake of a man he trusted for so long."

 RND.13.t:0 "Something Approaches"
 RND.13.desc:0 "There was only one agent set to listen in to the telegraph, and, really, that's all they needed. Hours of sitting and waiting to hear something - anything - helped to drive Dieter's boredom to the wall. He was tempted to leave his post momentarily and ask if someone else could be swapped out, or, hell, if he could get someone to be here with him. Still, it was his job to listen, and listen he would. Eventually, however, it was approaching almost two in the morning, and he was prepared to clock out of his shift. Until he heard it. Dit-dit, a pause.. Dieter immediately pulled out a pen and begin transcribing them into letters.\n\n"I... HAVE... BEEN... TRAPPED..."\n\nAnxiety lurched in his stomach. Trapped? That meant very, very bad news for any RND agent.\n\n"GERMANY... IS... IN... IMMEDIATE... DANGER..."\n\nDieter felt his chest tighten. This operation was on a tight leash. Any wrong judgements would mean sacking the agent responsible for the mission if what they said turned out to be false on the report. And hearing this... he swallowed, continuing to listen.\n\n"I... REPEA..."\n\nDieter accidentally wrote in the last letter before he stopped up and looked at the telegraph. It stopped. No more noise was coming out of it. Dieter felt nervousness climb in his throat. A minute passed. Five minutes. Ten. Thirty. An hour. His shift had already passed, and he heard nothing. Slowly, Dieter put down his headphones and headed for the door to call in someone else, but he stopped for a moment to see if he would hear anything."

Seems to be moving backwards in terms of technological progress while actively purging the intelligentsia.\n\nIntentions of Valery Yemelyanov - whose profile may be found on pg. 4 with a low-quality photo attached - seems to be on refounding the mythological Hyperborean civilization based on Greek mythology, except based on the principles of Slavic paganism and preparation for total war.

Posing as "Burgundian" citizens, we have gained insight into what civilian life is like inside the rogue state. To put it simply, there are Schutzstaffel agents around every street corner, and there is almost always a daily occurrence of someone being dragged through the streets. Staying undercover has proven difficult, and infiltrating into the core of the Burgundian state will likely be extremely difficult. Caution at all steps has been advised.\n\nThere is currently no updated profile available on Heinrich Himmler, but information on him before the Civil War is available on pg. 1 to 6. Assuming things go exceptionally well, however, we will be able to probe deeper into Burgundian intelligence. If we can find anything that the Black State, we shall. Even if it costs us our lives.

We've accomplished what Himmler and his agents never thought the RND could do. Uncovering what is likely Burgundy's chief modus operandi, we have discovered two facts. One; the Burgundian state has and is built for the sake of resource and wealth extraction to funnel into its intelligence agency, everything else is merely for the sake of stability and keeping the regime alive. Two; we have found something dreadful. There is more information pg. 1 to 15., but to give a brief explanation:\n\nOrdensstaat-Burgund's intelligence agency is primarily geared towards international operations. They follow what is known as the Globalplans - meticulous plans detailed towards exploiting ethnic, racial, religious and political tensions within more fragile parts of the world. They all share a similar goal, however. Every region outlined in these globalplans have the capacity of involving two or more superpowers.

speerpoland.1.t:0 "The OKW's Proposal"
speerpoland.1.d:0 "Henning von Tresckow was typically a very well dressed man, and today was no exception. His uniform, exquisitely ironed and cleaned, made even Speidel's uniform look messy and rumpled- and Speidel's uniform was holding up better than most. Together, they passed their report to the Fuhrer. If Tresckow's uniform looked tidy, and Speidel's looked alright, then Speer's suit looked like a mess of wrinkles and ink marks.\n\n"Herr Speidel, Herr Tresckow. May I have an explanation of your plan?" Speer spoke softly, his eyes crossing the lettering. Tresckow cleared his throat before beginning.\n\n"Germany holds numerous clear advantages over the new Polish state, but the most obvious one is our military advantage, Herr Speer. The Heer dwarfs anything the Poles could throw up. I propose that we use this fact to our advantage." Speidel nodded in agreement. Speer put the paper back down.\n\n"Invasion?" He asked bluntly. Tresckow's brow furrowed before he continued.\n\n"No, no- at least, not preferably. The threat of invasion should be more than sufficient to force the Poles to bend the knee. Besides that, multiple actions that benefit Poland will hopefully aid in creating a perception that we are no longer imperial maniacs, but rather a benevolent custodian."\n\nSpeer smiled. "I like it. You have my full permission to go ahead."\n\n"And, my Fuhrer, if they refuse- well, the threat of invasion is not an empty one." Speidel added, a faint smile crossing his lips. Speer nodded and watched as they exited."
speerpoland.1.a:0 "Let's see how it goes."

speerpoland.2.t:0 "The German Threat"
speerpoland.2.d:0 "Bad news has reached Warsaw today. The Germans are returning. A plan, outlined by Feldmarschall Speidel, details a scheme by the Germans to return to Polish lands. If it is not accepted, it's quite clear that Poland will not be spared an invasion. Germany will have hegemony, one way or the other."
speerpoland.2.a:0 "Accept"
speerpoland.2.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.3.t:0 "The Right Man"
speerpoland.3.d:0 "Two letters adorned Speer's desk today, and one made him significantly happier than the other.\n\nThe first was from the OKW itself. The issue of who to select for the occupation of Poland was a prickly one, and the two letters sitting on Speer's desk painted both sides nicely. On one hand was a letter from Tresckow, recommending an old army friend- Werner Schrader. The main part of Tresckow's pitch was Schrader's history in the Wehrmacht- a history of resistance to the greatest atrocities the Heer pulled off. Tresckow's argument rested upon this resistance- after all, would a standard Wehrmacht man be able to hold onto control in Poland without compromising the new face of the Reich?\n\nThe second letter was much more infuriating. Coming directly from Ferdinand Schorner- the root of all evil, Speer thought- this letter seemed directly out of the 40's. A screed against the Reich's new course, the Reich's decision on Poland, and the Polish nation in general, Schorner's letter called for an immediate reversal back into the genocidal policies of the Reich's earlier days. Incredible, Speer thought. To Schorner, everything was the nail, and he was always the hammer. It's as if he didn't realize that the war was over.\n\nThe choice was obvious. Speer sent a letter back to Tresckow, granting his approval of Schrader's portfolio. As a near afterthought, he swept Schorner's letter into the trash."

Then, they had fought their way through the fields of Europe, shredding the Polish Army, marching all the way to the hell that was the battle of Warsaw. Thousands of dead later, the city- and Poland- was theirs.\n\nTheir commander was hoping it would not need to happen again.\n\nThe men eyed the border guards on the Polish side as they raised the gate. Was there an ambush down the road? A division ready to kill any German they saw? As they drove through, tank commanders kept their hatches down and their guns up, ready for the attack they knew was coming.\n\nAnd yet, with every kilometer they drove with no interruption, their fear began to turn to disbelief. When they reached their first town, each and every tank commander silently sweat as the division of Armia Krajowa they were to disarm stood at attention. This is it, most thought. This was the moment where it all went to hell.\n\nWhen the Poles actually began to hand over their rifles, the disbelief was written all the 10th's faces as they handed out their medicine and food. The commander of the Poles was last in line- he took his food and medicine, looked into the German commander's stunned eyes, and smirked before walking away."

When the first line of smoke was sighted, far down the line, a shock of excitement swept through the crowd and the police line braced for impact.\n\nBy the time the train pulled into the station, a hushed tension had overtaken the crowd. Necks craned as German guards hopped from their carriages, securing a perimeter and a way out of the crowd. The tension in the air grew thick and heavy as the doors to the carrier cars opened.\n\nWhen the first slave, still in his prison uniform, stepped slowly into the sun, there was a moment of disbelief. Suddenly, the crowd exploded into cheers, chanting, yelling, and the police line buckled under the weight of thousands straining against them. As the slaves walked down the passage set out for them, flowers poured down onto their heads. Families strained to see loved ones.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the first truly joyous day for all of Poland since the revolution- their men were coming home. If the Germans were coming with them, so be it."

speerpoland.6.t:0 "The Polish Accept"
speerpoland.6.d:0 "Good news from Warsaw today. It seems that the Polish government has recognized its hopeless situation and, seeing no other alternative, has decided to give in. Speidel's offer has been accepted in full, and the stipulations of the peace are already beginning to be enforced.\n\nSpeer smiled when he read the message, already feeling the constant headache he had begin to clear. Thank god for Speidel. No treaty terms, no negotiations, no back and forth. Just a simple, clear statement and a simple, clear response. No Germans would die over Poland, and another victory for Speer would be delivered to his doorstep.\n\nAs he sat down, he made a mental reminder to invite Speidel over for a drink or two sometime. The man certainly deserved it."
speerpoland.6.a:0 "Splendid."

speerpoland.7.t:0 "The Polish Decline"
speerpoland.7.d:0 "Stunning news from Warsaw today- the Polish government has lost its mind. At least, that's the assumption of the Fuhrer's office, as instead of the diplomatic victory we expected, we've been delivered a bewildering refusal of our terms. To call this unexpected would be a massive understatement, as would it be a massive understatement to call this foolish. Poland stands no chance against the Reich's war machine- indeed, it seems this decision is made only in a desperate grasp to retain a sense of national pride. Whatever the motive, it seems that violence is inevitable.\n\nSpeer could feel his headache pulsate with every word of the refusal he read. Enraged, he tossed the letter into his trashcan. Were they serious? Did they think they would stand any chance against the Heer? Was this all merely an attempt to make Speer's life as hard as possible? In any case, it was clear- German boots would march over the Polish plains once again as invaders. The Fuhrer sighed as he sat down- this would be a mess in the Reichstag. He could only hope that Speidel was not as bad a commander as he was a negotiator."
speerpoland.7.a:0 "Damn it."

speerpoland.8.t:0 "Speak Softly"
speerpoland.8.d:0 ""So, Herr Schmidt. I've read about your plan." Speer looked up from his desk, his eyes meeting his Foreign Minister's. "I'd like you to explain it to me more, because frankly, I don't understand why we need to go to this much effort over a place like Poland."\n\nSchmidt straightened his tie. "It's less about Poland itself and more about the international effects, my Fuhrer."\n\nSpeer leaned back in his chair. "Elaborate."\n\n"Well, we could enforce our will through force of arms on the Poles, as we did in the 30's, but the main issue is that internationally, this would threaten our image as a reformist, gentler Reich."\n\n"The issue with your plan, Herr Schmidt, is that it's going to force us into promises we might not want to keep."\n\n"I understand my plan is not perfect, but it is the only way to keep our image safe. Besides, negotiation means no bloodshed, and neither of us want that, do we?" Schmidt smiled.\n\n"No, of course not. I give you permission to go ahead. Don't screw this up for me, will you?" Speer shuffled in his chair. Schmidt nodded before leaving the room, the hopes of the Reich's new standing resting squarely on his shoulders."
speerpoland.8.a:0 "We'll see how this goes."

speerpoland.9.t:0 "Offer for Diplomacy from Germany"
speerpoland.9.d:0 "Surprising news has come from Germania today- it seems that Helmut Schmidt, the Reich's foreign minister, wishes to negotiate a peace between the Reich and Poland. Should we agree to this? If we decline, the Reich may invade- something which, despite our best hopes, will be nearly impossible to defeat."
speerpoland.9.a:0 "Agree"
speerpoland.9.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.10.t:0 "A Step Towards the Future"
speerpoland.10.d:0 "The news passed through the Foreign Ministry's hands quickly, fast tracked to two offices- Helmut Schmidt's and Albert Speer. The message read like a celebration- the Poles had, after much consideration and debate, accepted talks with Helmut Schmidt. Together, they wrote, they hoped that Poland and Germany would work together to take Europe into an ascendant future, these talks being the groundworks to lay such a foundation. Of course, it was all diplomatic flattery for now- nobody would dare to be brutally honest this early- but it was enough for Germany, and it was certainly enough for Schmidt and Speer.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert read the letter with a sigh of relief as he took a drink. Worries danced in his mind- what if they forced the Reich's hand? What if Schmidt promised the stars and the sun?- but he sidelined them for now. For now, things were moving along smoothly. Speer had to admit, despite his personal dislike of Schmidt, he got things done.\n\nIn Schmidt's office, Helmut took the news joyously. He had expected them to accept, but it actually happening gave him an opening. With the cooperation of the Poles, he could help set things right, once and for all, and Europe would be one step closer to the light."
speerpoland.10.a:0 "The hopes of Poland rest uneasy."

speerpoland.11.t:0 "Falling Back"
speerpoland.11.d:0 "The news shattered the morale of every hand it touched- a lightning strike to the reformists, a frustrating setback to the Speerites. It slowly slid its way through the Foreign Ministry, to be deposited with a thump on the desks of Speer and Schmidt. The news it communicated would be dismissed as comedy if it wasn't so real- the Poles, for whatever insane reason, had declined to negotiate, promising to defend Poland to the final man. Negotiations were dead before they even had the chance to begin.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert sat with a mixture of a sigh and an angered grunt. He'd listened to Schmidt for once, and look where it got them. The Poles thought they were weak, thought that Germany wouldn't be willing to take them on, all because Schmidt had decided to try and throw a rabid dog a carrot. Now, the Heer would need to get its hands dirty. He could already see the coffins, draped in the swastika, coming home from whatever muddy hellhole the Poles were in now. He could see the shitshow in the Reichstag from a mile away. Schmidt had gotten his way, and now look what had happened.\n\nIn Schmidt's office was, somehow, even more depressed than Speer's. Helmut slammed the letter into his trashcan with an angry grunt. He'd gambled, and somehow the Poles had screwed him over for it. What did they expect to happen? All they had done was make things worse for everyone. He sat down and awaited the angry call from a million different officials- the plan had collapsed, and here he was with a giant target on his back. He downed a drink before he took the first one."
speerpoland.11.a:0 "What do they think they're doing?"

speerpoland.12.t:0 "Germans in Poland"
speerpoland.12.d:0 "The tension between the two delegations lay thick and heavy in the conference room. Schmidt's eyes nervously darted across the faces of the Polish negotiators, settling finally on their head- one Stanislaw Wachowiak. Wachowiak's eyes bored right into Schmidt as the clock hit 12, and the meeting officially began.\n\nThe initial pleasantries soon faded away into a mess of diplomatic jargon, as veiled barbs and offers soon flew across the table. Unsurprisingly, it was not long before the first roadblock hit- the status of Germans in Poland.\n\n"The privileges that Germans in Poland held under the Generalgouvernement are unacceptable! We're practically chattel compared to them! Second class citizens in our own nation! We cannot, repeat, cannot go back to the old way of things- not now, not ever! They cannot continue to hold the privileges that they once did!" Wachowiak finished his fiery rant with a hearty slap of the table, to applause from his own delegation. The German delegation turned to Schmidt, his face deep in thought. A partial repeal of the Nuremberg Laws- something he'd wanted for years, but something that may fall well afoul of Speer's expectation. Besides, removing the rights of Germans for the wants of Poles- a group that much of Germany still considered "Untermensch''- was undoubtedly a shit show waiting to happen in itself. However, would the Poles accept a deal without this caveat? He sighed before responding, knowing these words would follow him forever."
speerpoland.12.a:0 "Keep up the Laws."
speerpoland.12.b:0 "The Poles deserve rights."

speerpoland.13.t:0 "Status of the Home Army"
speerpoland.13.d:0 ""Now, Mr. Wachowiak, onto the next topic- the Home Army." Schmidt read from his agenda slowly, taking a breath before continuing. "As previously agreed, the Home Army will disarm and disband, assuming these talks go through. This is correct, yes?"\n\n"Of course." Wachowiak straightened his tie as he spoke. Schmidt rolled his eyes as he reached the next point, bracing himself for the explosion.\n\n"Yes, of course. However, there have been calls from our more conservative counterparts to prosecute some of these men for, ah. . .'' Schmidt could see Wachowiak turning red in the face already, and he readied himself for the explosion. "Ah, treason and terrorism. Now, Mr. Wachowiak, these men did commit acts of violence against the German garrison-"\n\nWachowiak shot to his feet. "You're joking, Herr Schmidt! You can't be serious! You dare call fighting for freedom terrorism? Do you know how hard it's been to get the Home Army to even agree to disarm? They'll go ballistic! If you're going to arrest every freedom fighter in Poland, you may as well arrest this entire delegation, because I cannot think of a Polish man who did not fight the Germans! This is unacceptable, Herr Schmidt, simply unacceptable!" He roared, leaning over the table towards the German. Schmidt massaged his temples- a headache was coming on, and he doubted it would get any better until these talks finished."
speerpoland.13.a:0 "Disarmament shall suffice."
speerpoland.13.b:0 "Terrorism is terrorism."

speerpoland.14.t:0 "Status of Polish Slavery"
speerpoland.14.d:0 ""We both understand that the Fuhrer's policy on slavery is one of dismantlement, is that right?" Wachowiak spoke first this time, his voice having noticeably softened in the last hour or so. The attention of the table once again turned to him, including Schmidt's gaze.\n\n"Yes, that would be true." Schmidt responded, his eyes narrowing, a hint of Wachowiak's game beginning to form in his mind. Another bombshell, if Schmidt's intuition was true.\n\n"And these freed slaves are to be repatriated to their home nations, yes?" Wachowiak's gaze bored into Schmidt, who grew increasingly sure of where this conversation was being taken. He prepared a response in his head- this would be another headache to add to the pile.\n\n"Yes, that's the plan." Schmidt responded, steeling his voice.\n\n"Thousands of Poles still find themselves in German shackles today, Herr Schmidt, with years left before their freedom. Surely, as part of these talks, it's possible to speed their freedom, is it not?" Wachowiak's gaze never left Schmidt's eyes as he tried to think of a diplomatic response to this one.\n\n"Repatriation is a complicated business, especially when combined with-"\n\n"It's a yes-no question, Herr Schmidt." Schmidt slumped a little in his chair. This was never going to end, was it?"
speerpoland.14.a:0 "We need to stay realistic about Repatriation."
speerpoland.14.b:0 "Push for quicker Polish repatriation."

speerpoland.15.t:0 "Status of the Nuremberg Laws"
speerpoland.15.d:0 "The end of the conference was in sight, and Schmidt for one couldn't wait for it. He had known that his decisions would cause a storm of anger somewhere, no matter what he said, but he couldn't help but feel like this was going to be especially bad. His eyes, which had begun to glaze over with the endless conversation, snapped back to attention when they saw Wachowiak rise from his seat.\n\n"Now, I understand we have already touched on the topic of the Nuremberg laws-" Oh, christ, Schmidt thought. If there was something to fill his desk with angry letters, it was the Nuremberg laws."-But we have only spoken of the excessive privilege that Germans held in Poland. What we have not discussed is Polish rights- specifically, how limited they are."\n\nAs Wachowiak went through the list of limits on the Poles, Schmidt's thoughts turned inward. Once again, here was an opportunity to strike another blow at something that he had hated since the day he joined this job- the Nuremberg Laws, an outdated weight on the ankle of Germany, one that needed to be cut off. In any other case, he would not hesitate in cutting another slice into the Laws, but now? The Laws were the main legal guideline for Germany's treatment of the Poles. Such a massive change would definitely be something Speer would like to know about, and that was what was holding Schmidt back. He did not know Speer's position on the issue, and despite how much he disliked the man personally, Speer was the one who controlled his job. To go against him too much might just lead to his dismissal- something Schmidt couldn't allow to happen.\n\n"So, Herr Schmidt, I ask you-" Wachowiak finished with a flourish, leveling an accusatory finger at Schmidt's head. "-Is the Reich truly as reformist as it claims? Will you throw off the shackles that bind Poland?""
speerpoland.15.a:0 "Tone down on the Laws."
speerpoland.15.b:0 "This is too much to ask right now."

speerpoland.16.t:0 "Polish Budget"
speerpoland.16.d:0 ""Before this conference wraps up, Herr Schmidt, we have but one more topic to discuss." Wachowiak carefully pressed forth with the last topic on his paper, catching Schmidt as he was about to rise from his seat. Schmidt froze for a second, his face momentarily betraying the stress this conference had put on him, before he sat back down and gestured for Wachowiak to continue.\n\n"Besides the infrastructure built for Poland to become the Reich's logistical hub, Poland as a whole was neglected by the Reich. Our infrastructure in most places fails, our utilities are on the brink of failing, our roads are dotted with holes and cracks- we're on the brink of a disaster, Herr Schmidt. The Reich's coffers are certainly not empty- perhaps you can send some funds to our new government in order to allow us to rebuild? I promise you, such funds would be spent on infrastructure alone, nothing more."\n\nSchmidt took a deep breath in and out. Of course they were going for the wallet of the Reich now, as if they hadn't already aimed daggers at the rest of the Reich's institutions. Schmidt wasn't opposed to it himself- he just knew that it would maximise the amount of angry paperwork he'd need to sort through in the next month or two. Thoughts of a raging Speer clouded his mind- how many decisions had he already made for the Fuhrer? How many of them had been directly against his wishes?\n\nIn any case, it was the last decision to make, and then they would all shake hands and retire to their hotel rooms. Schmidt could only hope that his decisions would be acceptable to the Polish government- otherwise, this was going to be a mess for everyone involved."
speerpoland.16.a:0 "Grant them money."
speerpoland.16.b:0 "There's no point in it."

speerpoland.17.t:0 "The Treaty is Signed"
speerpoland.17.d:0 "Television crews crowded the conference room, reporters crammed themselves into every nook and cranny of the building, and the flash of cameras rattled like a machine gun. Schmidt did his best not to blink at the barrage- the last thing he needed on top of the inevitable storm he was going to catch was an unflattering image of him smeared across the front pages of every newspaper in Germany.\n\nTo his right, Wachowiak sat and smiled, looking quite pleased with himself. Schmidt couldn't blame him- he was going home a hero, having taken on the German giant and wrangled a deal that Poland could get behind out of it. Schmidt was less enthused himself- he would be going home to a storm of conservative anger and, most likely, at least one or two tense meetings with Speer. Speer hadn't said anything about the terms yet, but some of them would certainly be enough to make him tear what remained of his hair out.\n\nAnd yet, at the end of the day, Schmidt was proud of himself. He'd not only succeeded in his task, but he'd advanced his cause. Germany was on the cusp of entering a new golden age, and with Schmidt's help, he would make sure it would happen. With the treaty signed, who knew what could happen with the rest of Eastern Europe? Perhaps, soon enough, Germany could truly be first among equals in their eyes, not just a colonial overlord.\n\nAnd so, as Wachowiak put pen to paper and signed his name on the treaty, Schmidt's expression turned into a small grin as he put ink to his own."
speerpoland.17.a:0 "The new golden age is almost here."

speerpoland.18.t:0 "The Treaty Falls Apart"
speerpoland.18.d:0 "Schmidt's room was dark, illuminated only by a lamp at his desk casting a yellow glow across it. The darkness hid most of the two men's faces- Schmidt and Wachowiak. Schmidt glanced at the clock- 2 in the morning, always a good time for diplomatic meetings. "So, what's the deal, Wachowiak? We've been waiting for hours. Communication troubles?"\n\n"No, no." Wachowiak was quiet, keeping his voice low. "I've been in contact with Warsaw just fine."\n\n"So what's the issue, then? We can schedule another session-" A drop of fear struck the bottom of Schmidt's gut, a slowly rising tide of worry.\n\n"No, no, Schmidt. It's over. They've left the conference. We're to go home effective immediately. The treaty is unacceptable."\n\nSchmidt's gut shot into his throat, and he choked on his next words. This couldn't happen to him. He couldn't have failed like this. He had wrangled so many things in line, pushed so many things his way, all for nothing? Visions of his face plastered as a scapegoat and fool across every paper in Germany shot through his mind like a bullet. Oh, god, what would Speer say? He'd put all his trust behind Schmidt's idea of a peaceful reconciliation. Now that it had fallen apart, would he ever listen to Schmidt again? Would he ever even try to negotiate again? Schmidt's plans fell apart in front of him as he struggled for words, struggled for air.\n\n"Stanislaw, you can't do this to me!" he shouted, but Stanislaw was already gone, the door shutting behind him. Schmidt was left alone, with only his furious, incredulous, terrified thoughts to keep him company."
speerpoland.18.a:0 "A travesty!"

speerpoland.19.t:0 "Ending a Farce"
speerpoland.19.d:0 "The Generalgouvernement of Poland had looked like a shiny jewel to the Rest of the Reich. When revolts had erupted all over Poland, however, Hans Frank's administration was revealed for what it was: a giant castle of lies, built on foundations of bribery and falsification of public reports. Everyone had thought such an inefficient and corrupt regime would have been crushed by the rage of the Polish resistance that had been festering in Poland's purulent bureaucracy and society for decades, but instead, Frank managed to resist the onslaught, whether due to bribes, ruthless repression or simply a stroke of luck.\n\nNow, however, a new regime rules in Germania, one which can no longer tolerate such a shameful conduct. Frank will be brought in front of a court, and his administration will be disbanded in favor of one more capable of serving Germany's interests... and perhaps even Poland's, should this be in our plans. The problem is, the cur knows what awaits him once he is relieved of his office, and refuses to submit, denying our Führer's legitimate claim to the mantle of Hitler's heir.\n\nTo address this issue, Feldmarschall von Tresckow has planned a quick and decisive military action, aimed at securing Poland and bringing Frank to justice. Our troops will cross the border and disarm the security forces of the Generalgouvernement: little resistance is expected as they have little in the way of numbers and equipment, especially with the Polish resistance keeping most of them constantly overstretched. The time to end this farce has long since been due, and now is the perfect time to draw the curtain."
speerpoland.19.a:0 "Frank will pay for his crimes."

speerpoland.20.t:0 "Hans Frank Surrenders!"
speerpoland.20.d:0 "As expected, the Generalgouvernement couldn't face the military might of the Wehrmacht, crippled by the Bürgerkrieg as it may be. The garrison offered mostly a token resistance before surrendering unconditionally, and our troops quickly converged on Warsaw: there, Hans Frank was already preparing to flee the country, but his retreat towards the airport was cut by an elite commando, and he was forced to capitulate when faced with the prospect of summary execution. Within a few hours, the few loyalists still fighting either dropped their weapons or were defeated by the Heer's crushing superiority.\n\nThe Generalgouvernement has been disbanded, and replaced by a provisory military administration that will ensure a return to normalcy. Our inspectors have already scoured Frank's archives, both public and secret, finding more than enough evidence of his crimes - bribery, embezzlement, falsification of public documents, treason, the list is very long - to permanently seal his fate, but the final choice rests in Speer's hands: should he be executed for his treasonous conduct, or merely imprisoned for life? Both choices would satisfy the population, but each will appeal to one of the currents within the government."
speerpoland.20.a:0 "Frank will meet the hangman."
speerpoland.20.b:0 "Imprisonment will suffice."

 speerbohemia.1.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nThe Reich has long considered Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren to be one of the most successful Germanization projects. As you know, the purpose of the Protektorat is to pacify the local population, and, through the various means available to them, make it so that they are either phased out for ethnic Germans, or educated to the point that we can call them proper Aryans. It has mainly been the second, and it has been a great success at that. The Protektorat, then, has succeeded in its objective; I would consider it now to be a viable territory to be annexed directly into the glorious Reich. I am hopeful that you understand my reasoning for this, Herr Lutz, and that you will comply with my request, which I am certain would not come as a major difficulty for you. Your service has been valuable, and now the next step must be taken.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n - Führer Speer"

I would gladly accept entry into Germania, seeing as how my leadership of this Protektorat has led to it being established as almost entirely Germanized. There is, however, one issue that remains which both you and I must confront. There has been an issue going around-- a very strange one, at that. We both know of the SS, the cancer that manifests itself as Ordensstaat Burgund, but also as smaller tumors that spread across Europe. They have spread here, too, but fortunately the Czech Guard has, under the leadership of Rudolf Toussaint, beaten back this nest of degeneracy. For that, Rudolf has called for a special proposal to be made. For their efforts, he desires for the Czechs to immediately be recognized as honorary Aryans. My Führer, it is only with you would I have even bothered sending this proposal back to you, for you are an understanding leader. It is my hope that you can accept this compromise in order for the Protektorat to be now and forever be fully integrated into the Reich.\n\nHeil!\n\n - Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"

 speerbohemia.3.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nI must bring you unfortunate news. The idea that the Czechs must be turned into honorary Aryans has not been received well in Germania. They may have spilt blood to protect their territory, yes, but they are subservient to the Reich first. They must learn its culture and its ways, they must learn the language, and they must learn that to become a German, you must know what it is to be a German. Anything else would be a disapproving notion of the Germanization process. I'm certain you understand then, Herr Lutz, when I tell you that my asking of the Protektorat to become a part of the Reich is no longer a request. It is a demand. This is, unfortunately, how things must go. I will give you a period of 72 hours to respond. If you do not respond in this time, the consequences will be drastic.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n - Führer Speer"

While it may be slightly unbefitting for the Czechs to become Aryans on the spot, doing so would solve a multitude of our problems. As is the case right now, I cannot stand to comment on the actions of the Schutzstaffel in the Protektorat, but I can assure you that no foreign element will commit any sort of subversion in the territory. With this out of the way, I can congratulate your service for the Reich, Herr Lutz, and you will be rewarded generously in helping Germania expand its dominion to rightfully include all proper Germans, and honorary Aryans, into its home. That is all I shall be writing in this letter. The rest will come naturally, as we can finally say that this chapter of Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren is closed.\n\n - Führer Speer"

But as the minutes turned into hours turned into days, his anxiety grew and grew. There was a mild annoyance for him after the first twenty-four hours, which turned into a bothering feeling that plagued him for another twenty-four hours, and once the final day had begun, it manifested into Speer pacing in his office, waiting, just waiting, for someone to come through and hand him a note. That they would say, "My Führer, you've received a letter from Reichsprotektorat Lutz," and then bid him a crisp salute before hurrying off.\n\nBut that moment of reprieve never came. Instead, the bell had struck midnight, and Speer almost drew blood from biting in his fingertip as the last seconds of peace slipped past him. Now he had an issue to deal with. Not a big one militarily, but it would show itself to the rest of the world as a glaring hole in Mitteleuropa. If he couldn't peacefully annex one of the most integrated subjects of the Reich, what would that say for all the others?

Immense pressure has been put on me from Rudolf to continue negotiating these terms. Eventually, however, I forced his hand and he had to back down after a fierce argument we've recently had.

 speerbohemia.8.t:0 "The Madmen Over the Mountains"
 speerbohemia.8.d:0 "Speer sat around in his office, cross-legged, frustrated, looking at his desk at a stack of papers while rubbing two fingers against his forehead. He wasn't really unaware about the circumstances facing Bohemia. In fact, he was fully aware that the SS, puppets of Himmler's insanity, had planted themselves into the Protektorat and had gone so far as to openly begin clashing with the German loyalists there. He was not expecting them to win, no, even if they were expertly trained, they were outnumbered, outgunned, and they had the resistance of the local populace. But something unexpected happened.\n\nThey did win.\n\nAnd now Speer had to deal with the issue of SS Bohemia staring down the barrel of the Empire. With casualties and destruction certain to follow, the whole process was something he wasn't exactly enthusiastic about. All Speer could hope for was that the ensuing conflict would be quick and relatively bloodless.\n\nSeveral minutes later, an old man came into Speer's office, dressed in full military uniform, seemingly ready to head into combat. Speer had, obviously, recognized who this figure was. "Tresckow," he began, catching the man's attention as Speer leaned forward. "I'll make this quick. I'll be on my way to hold a speech in Vienna. While I'm gone, I'll have to ask you to organize the troops and send them to the border. You've already been briefed on the situation, so I assume you needn't ask twice about dealing with the SS."\n\nTresckow shook his head. "Regardless of the feelings I have for them, my Führer," he began, "Their resistance to entering the Reich will be met with a swift response. It's the only reasonable thing to do." The pride in his voice made Speer nod weakly, letting out a sigh as he waved his hand. "Yes, yes. I understand what you're trying to say. Now leave me be. I need to sort these papers out.""

In a minute he had gotten his uniform prepared - in another he obtained and loaded both his rifle and his sidearm, and in another he was standing shoulder to shoulder with his brothers all dressed in black. All in perfect order, as it should be, as it must be. Now he would continue to service the cause, and a gratitude of the continuation of this fact filled his mind for a moment, only for it to be just as quickly perished-- no emotion must linger too long.\n\nThe sharp cut through the air of a voice brought the soldier front and center into reality as the situation made itself clear and clarified in a moment's time. The degenerate Reich found itself trigger-happy to declare war against them for the sole purpose of being loyal to Ordenstaadt Burgund rather than the all-encompassing Empire that threatened their sovereignty. They had not earned this right, he would think, they would not step a foot in this land without proving themselves to be the low scum that they claimed to be otherwise.\n\nAnd so as the orders were barked out in meticulous order, boots marched across the floor of the barracks to prepare themselves for the eventual march outwards. He felt killing intent in his hands as he entered an armory designated for machine-gunners, and as he laid eyes upon a buzzsaw that would cut through rotten Aryan blood like a scythe through a field."

 speerbohemia.10.t:0 "To Prevent Terror"
 speerbohemia.10.d:0 "Vienna was empty that day. Or, at least, it was cleared out of citizens. Considering the enemy the Reich was about to take on, it wasn't sure just what exactly this SS force was capable of, even if everyone assumed that they would be quickly crushed. Either way, Speer had paved way to make a speech, just as he had said before to Tresckow, who seemed to have sortied the army efficiently to the borders. Now he had to rile up the troops to fight their own. Not too difficult, he hoped, considering that who they were fighting was, well...\n\n"Soldiers of the Reich!" He began, "There is a festering abomination just beyond these borders. I am unwilling to name the beast that wanders from land to land, spreading an ideology that only serves to corrupt and destroy the lands and men it touches!" A resounding agreement came from the soldiers. They knew of the Black State and its disgusting off-branch of "supremacy" that amounted to nothing but insanity. "That is why I implore you, as citizens of Germany, to see this threat in the Protektorat as an obstacle to unification and nothing more! The SS there will be quashed under our jackboot, and no mercy will be given to its adherents. Strike hard, quickly, and annihilate them!"\n\nSpeer could see it, clearly, that these men listening to him regarded the SS as more ideological foes of the Reich than a beast in the making. Whatever justification to butcher these vermin would be, it didn't matter to him, so long as the influence of Himmler was contained to his feudal playground and nothing more."
 speerbohemia.10.a:0 "The Protektorat shall join us soon enough."

 speerbohemia.11.t:0 "Marching on Prague"
 speerbohemia.11.d:0 "Noise - that's what it was. So much noise had polluted the city when the war began. From the SS moving in and doing what the SS does, ranging from executing those who refused to fully cooperate with them to immediately beginning preparations of turning the city into a death trap. They did not have much time on their hands, owing it to the fact that the forces of the Reich, gutless as they were, still fought on the cult of speed and combined arms. And so it was that when they finally arrived, trucks chugging into highways, planes dotting the sky, and boots stomping against gravel, did the SS spring their trap. Explosions rocked one street corner after another, filling entire sections of Prague with dust and smog, while gunfire rained down from above barred apartments and abandoned shops.\n\nThe fighting was grueling, to say the least. Every inch the Heer took, the agents of Himmler would make sure that it was paid dearly, either in blood spilled or buildings laying themselves bare and crippled after the SS exhausted their defensive capability. It was before the sun had fully set, nearing the edge of darkness, when Prague found a vague semblance of peace overtake the majority of the city. The destruction had not been severe enough to warrant a crisis, but a rebuilding program would need to be begun, and many heartfelt letters were sorely needed back in the homeland. Even still, the menace was driven out of the capital, which proved an effective end to the terror plaguing the Protektorate."

 ## Danish Events ##
 speerdenmark.1.t:0 "Approaching the Danes"
 speerdenmark.1.d:0 "Speer had always found it a little annoying, if he was to be openly honest about it, that this small nation of not much significance stood tall above the Reich, retaining its full independence and colours on any map printed out. Not only could they be easily swayed to join the Pakt, but he could make a strong case on why they would only benefit such a thing, being close Aryan brothers and having no real land disagreements. \n\n The idea would be twofold. First, Speer would offer the Danish government a small helping hand upon entering the Pakt, so they could ease themselves in and be comfortable amid the rest of the Reich's allies.\n\n Second, he would hold a speech that would be televised to viewers home and abroad, where he would testify to the strength of the Reich and the solitary situation the Danish found themselves, which, if they accepted the help of their Aryan brothers below, is something that would be easily rectified.\n\n Now, all that remained was to begin planning."
 speerdenmark.1.a:0 "They will return home."

 speerdenmark.2.t:0 "The Carrot and the Stick"
 speerdenmark.2.d:0 "There was nothing particularly outstanding about Denmark, he thought, once Speer had looked over the economic analysis of the country. Nothing at all that really made it especially valuable besides being another source for manpower and labor to feed into the Reich. That wasn't the concern here, however, even if Speer considered the Danes to be easy candidates for Germanization. They were to become allies first, and anything else would come afterwards.\n\nA short and direct economic plan was drafted up, which would give the Danes small, temporary privileges upon entering the Reich. This would take up a small portion of the Reich's budget, and perhaps annoy the other subjects of the Pakt slightly for favoring them like this, but continuing to consecrate rule across Europa would only benefit everyone involved."
 speerdenmark.2.a:0 "Now onto the next step."

 speerdenmark.3.t:0 "They're Nothing Without Us"
 speerdenmark.3.d:0 "Speer couldn't understand how some men could hold speeches that lasted for so long about such trivial things. This, chiefly, was one of those trivial things. He was already so close in convincing them to join that he was almost visibly annoyed with dragging it out with the Danes by the time he had to begin to address the people listening.\n\nThere was a short interlude whereupon a presenter introduced the many titles of the Führer, inciting roaring applause from the audience that was present, before the man nodded towards Speer as he let him take the stand.\n\n"To the people of Denmark, listen to what I have to say next. I wish to call upon you a simple fact - a statement that cannot be ignored, an issue that cannot be resolved, a bothersome idea that trails behind your every footstep." Speer took a deep breath.\n\n"You are alone. In this reshaping of the New World Order, you are alone."\n\n"All of your troubles, your loneliness, your vulnerability, this will leave you only as prey for greater powers willing to ruin you, bring you down into the sinking depths of history. But we are your Germanic brothers. We are your neighbours, the ones from across the river that shall bid you a warm greeting. We, the men of the Reich, are here for you. Like a man fumbling in the raging river, drowning and calling for help, we will come to you and lend you a hand. And with a mighty Germanic grip, we will pull you out, to the safety of the world, and we will call you a friend of ours."\n\n"Come, Denmark, for the thousand-year Reich shall soar with the rest of Europa on its wings.""
 speerdenmark.3.a:0 "I see how they hold speeches about trivial things, now."

 speerdenmark.4.t:0 "Welcome Home"
 speerdenmark.4.d:0 "Speer let out a sigh of relief. What else was he expecting to happen, really? Considering the geopolitical position of the Danes, there really was only one option left for them to take. The other would leave them stranded and alone, ripe for the taking. As he silently read the letter through in his office, a small, satisfied smile came to his lips. They had agreed, and over the course of the next month, Denmark would begin its entry into the Pakt. Seems like his Germanic rhetoric had worked after all, and the money boost certainly convinced the more pragmatic-minded Danes in their cabinet. The economy of the Einheitspakt would see a small, but noticeable, increase in its wealth, and the maps of Europa printed out in the future could finally shade that small blotch of land in as belonging to the Reich's sphere of influence."
 speerdenmark.4.a:0 "With this taken care of, Speer turns to other issues."

 speerdenmark.5.t:0 "The Extremists to the North"
 speerdenmark.5.d:0 "Damnation! While this wasn't the worst case scenario, it certainly came close to it. With the Hardliners now having a stranglehold on Denmark, there would certainly be no way to introduce them into the Pakt, seeing Speer's position as Führer to be a betrayal of their original values. Whatever they were planning, they had to be stopped and quickly brought under the wing of the Reich. Which is why he had to call for a certain... someone.\n\n"My Führer- it is a pleasure that I have been called to your office," the man in front of Speer spoke, standing tall and straight with a smile on his face. He put a hand out, and they both shook strongly before letting go. "I have a feeling you already know what I am about to tell you, Herr Reinhardt," Speer spoke, turning around and taking a few steps forwards to his desk. "I suppose I do, my Führer. This concerns Denmark, doesn't it?" The spymaster spoke, which confirmed Speer's suspicions. He didn't need to respond as his compatriot continued. "I will not speak on the topic of the ideology that has overtaken their government, but I can assure you that this will be an unusual operation." Speer could tell that Reinhardt was hiding something. Distaste, maybe? It didn't matter to him - they were National Socialists that would not compromise, and thus a threat to be destroyed.\n\n"There are already agents in place. What would you like me to do with them?" The response was obvious, but he wanted Speer to announce it for him. "Set them up for a coup. Your men... this operation will be risky, and if they're caught, they will likely face trial for their crimes. Anything less than treason against the state followed by execution would be a miracle." Reinhardt sighed, but did nothing more. The Führer could tell that the spymaster was getting impatient, and so he turned to face the man with a dismissive hand wave. "You are free to go. This operation is effective immediately."
 speerdenmark.5.a:0 "There will be no compromise with the Danish."

 speerdenmark.6.t:0 "Men on the Inside"
 speerdenmark.6.d:0 "The radio on the man's desk crackled to life as he approached it, and, sitting down, placed the headphones on his head. The shot of static made him flinch slightly, but the voice that followed afterwards gave him a smile."\n\n"Frederick, my friend!" He greeted boisterously, prompting the radio operator to turn down the volume. "Hah - how have you been, serving the Reich yonder over the border? I've just been spending my time walking around Copenhagen, following patrols and armored vehicles and taking pictures of them. It's not hard work, no, but I assume you've called me for a change of plans, eh?" He said, ending it with a short laugh.\n\nFrederick sighed softly. Could he let the man speak? It's almost as if he wasn't needed here. "Yes, Johann, I know what you've been doing recently-- it's my job to keep track of the agents in Denmark. At least, some of them, and that includes you." The static crackled back in with another bout of laughter. "That's the fighting spirit," Wilhelm commented. "Look, I've been seeing someone muck about in a pastry shop I've been frequenting recently. They seem sort of kept to themselves, but I can spot a proper Aryan when I see one! So tell me, Frederick, is that who I'm--"\n\n"Yes, yes it is." The dull, almost defeated voice cut in. "It's good that you're serving the Reich, and not the Danish. Look, if Headquarters is hearing in on this, they will have my neck. We are supposed to be disciplined, so I will give you your orders. Are you listening carefully?"\n\nSilence followed for several seconds afterwards.\n\n"Right then. That man you mentioned... you are to meet him, yes. His name is Oscar Blecher. Greet him with the phrase 'I wish to buy you a Lager, my friend', and he will recognize you right away as a man of the Reich. From then onwards, you are to follow his instructions. Is this clear?"\n\nAgain, silence dominated the radio frequency for a few seconds before Wilhelm spoke up, voice having now sombered up. "Yes, Bordfunker Frederick. I can assume, then, that this is where the operation will begin?", "That is the case. If you succeed, we will be able to topple the SS without having to fire a single shot. If not, then-", "Then nothing!" Wilhelm cut in joyously. "Don't worry about what will or will not happen. I hold no ill will towards the National Socialists here - but they stand in the way of the Reich. In toppling this resistance, I will be doing a service to the Führer. You have other things to tend to, my friend, and I hope to see you again. Now... goodbye, Bordfunker Frederick."
 speerdenmark.6.a:0 "Goodbye, Herr Wilhelm."

 speerdenmark.7.t:0 "Subverting Their Will"
 speerdenmark.7.d:0 "Frederick's pistol fit snugly in his coat as he felt the groove of the barrel while walking through the streets of Copenhagen. He dressed in civilian clothing, naturally, though made sure to wear thick enough clothing to conceal the weapon he was carrying with him. As he looked upon a small band of armed soldiers walking across a narrow street, he stopped up for a moment, glancing at the rifles in their hands for a moment before swiftly turning his head away. He hoped, he thought, he well and truly hoped that he didn't stand out as an oddity in these empty streets as he took the opportunity to scan his surroundings once more. Seeing now that there were no soldiers in this small section of Copenhagen, he dashed into a nearby alleyway, footsteps pounding against concrete that softened into blades of grass and dirt.\n\n"Herr... Frederick?" A voice called out in the darkness. He could recognize who it was. Or, rather, who they were. "I'm glad you recognized me. Was it my hair?" The sarcasm in his voice was annoyingly audible as a gang of three showed themselves. All three of them seemed heavily armed though lightly armored, carrying molotovs, grenades, each with a set of pistols, and one of them having a submachine gun. "No, Herr Reinhardt," spoke the one with the largest weapon, a heavy Danish accent tinting his German. "Nobody would willingly go into this alleyway alone."\n\nHe rolled his eyes. "Of course they wouldn't! I was only making a joke! I..." Reinhardt rolled his eyes. "Well, all humor aside, I suppose you gentlemen are here to parley with me. I know we are not friends, certainly, but I am under the orders of my Führer to help your resistance activities. I believe you will find my expertise to be most... exciting, if I may say."\n\n"Yeah?" One of them chimed in. "And you have to offer us what exactly?" The German chuckled heartily. "I am not a man of firearms."
 speerdenmark.7.a:0 "But if you give me a grenade or two, I can show you a trick."

 speerdenmark.8.t:0 "The Coup Begins"
 speerdenmark.8.d:0 "He swore he could feel his entire body shaking from that one. Well - it didn't matter now, did it?\n\n"Herr Frederick, if I may be so curious as to ask," came the voice of a man that was nearly drowned out by gunfire, "did the bastard Aryans hire you because they saw your potential, or because you bombed the nearest barr-" In speaking of bombs, two pairs of eyes spotted something distinctly hand-grenade-shaped coming their way, with both men giving all their strength to jump the hell away from where it would land. Frederick managed to get himself behind an empty oil barrel, while his other friend, who he came to know as Albert, took cover behind a shot-up, deflated truck. The German could tell when the explosion came when he felt a lack of noise and a presence of ringing in his ears both occurring at the same time, which he took as an opportunity to dust himself off and grip the pistol in his hand properly, turning back around and meeting up with Albert once again.\n\n"All of this just for our country to be handed over to the bloody Aryan," the other man spit out, glaring fiercely. "Shedding the blood of my countrymen... I thought I would be doing this for democracy." Frederick grinned. "Look at it this way, my Danish friend- we coup your country, we install a vague semblance of democracy. You enter the Pakt, you prosper from it. It's so simple, I hardly doubt anyone would say no to it." Albert audibly grumbled at that last part, only being stopped from speaking by being forced to duck his head under a shower of gunfire.\n\nThe conversation stopped for a few seconds to let the noise calm down enough for someone to actually be audible. "I hate this," Albert growled. "Don't look at me like that!" Frederick responded with fake concern. "Come on...""
 speerdenmark.8.a:0 "At least we're getting rid of the Hardliners for you."

 speerdenmark.9.t:0 "The Coup Fails"
 speerdenmark.9.d:0 "Frederick finally found himself some peace and quiet. In this abandoned-out building, he could rest for just a little bit. As he entered a room, he noticed that there was an abandoned sniper sitting perched up on a window, obviously aiming outside. His eyes widened and also shined when he spotted the weapon, even letting out a small 'ooh' as he approached it. Examining it carefully, he could see what it was. And the results were outstanding - it was a vintage weapon! Even more than that, it was a modified vintage weapon. The Karabiner 98 kurz with a scope mounted on top. Frederick was no marksman, but if this plan went successfully, then he could perhaps take this and keep it for himself as a reward for his service when he returned home. Though, he hadn't heard from his allies outside in a while, he was certain that everything would go alright.\n\nThat was, until he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him. Frederick froze in place; he recognized the distance immediately, and it was not one that he would risk turning around for. Instead, he opted to slowly raise his arms up in the air, closing his eyes for a short while and taking a deep breath. The voice that came afterwards he only understood in fragments, but he didn't have to translate it. "German," he said, "I am a German. I don't understand Danish," he continued, and there was nothing in response for a second or two afterwards, which made the anxiety in his stomach grow heavier. Then, he heard a sigh, and another pair of footsteps. "You are coming with me, Aryan." It was slow, broken up and paced awkwardly, but it would make do. "Trial for treason."\n\nFrederick bit his lower lip. What the hell was he to do now except hand himself over? There was something, at least - a question that burned in his mind that he wanted answered before the inevitable came. "What has happened to the others outside?" A quick, cruel laughter came to meet his question. "Idiotic Aryan. Is it not clear?""
 speerdenmark.9.a:0 "You have failed your mission. Now, come, with the rest of the scum."

 speerdenmark.10.t:0 "Formalizing The Ultimatum"
 speerdenmark.10.d:0 ""To the people of Denmark..."\n\nSpeer crossed one leg over the other and stared at the typewriter. How was he going to formulate this... ? "The situation has turned dire." He was to emphasize the danger the Danes were putting themselves in. Something about how the mistake they have made was grave, but in a way that showed strength, not desperation. "The Reich is unafraid to show why it is the Master of Europa." That would certainly catch their attention. Furthermore, he had to showcase that there is no degeneracy plaguing Germania. After all, if he wanted them to join the Pakt as well, he wanted to get them on their good side. And so...\n\n"... Ever since our magnificent victory so long ago, we have established a Reich that would last for generations to come. This is unprecedented in history. The empires of old - the Achaemenids, the Romans, the Francians, the British, they all share one fatal flaw in common. They relied on the strength of their arms, not on the strength of their people. We, however, are unified in our cause. It is, therefore, imperative that your people understand their position."\n\nHere Speer took a gamble.\n\n"The Reich's strength is unparalleled, its discipline unrivalled, and we do not wish to bring the full might of the Wehrmacht upon your nation. It would only bring ruin. Instead, we demand that you do two things. First, you will release every man related to the attempted coup in Copenhagen. They will be guaranteed safety, whether German or Danish, from any acts of violence against them. Secondly, the nation of Denmark will enter the Einheitspakt, and will be treated as any regular member. Your opportunity to join as a special member has passed. Now there is only one choice to be made.""
 speerdenmark.10.a:0 "For the Danish Volk, I hope you make the correct choice."

 speerdenmark.11.t:0 "Denmark Refuses"
 speerdenmark.11.d:0 "Frederick was restrained from head to toe - not only did he have cuffs on, he also had a see-through bag on his head. Really, he thought, this was absurd. Admittedly he had only seen one trial in-person, and that was for a theft of goods in his hometown. The court wasn't nearly as grand as this, and nor was the judge as loud as the one he heard beforehand. He could barely understand what he was hearing, either, but the sinking feeling he had would tell him everything he needed to know. Here and there, while uncomfortably shuffling in his seat, he could hear the judge yelling out words like 'treason', 'betrayal', 'court', and probably a couple of swears here and there. The lump in his throat grew bigger as time passed, and a few questions were wandering his mind. Mainly, how long this whole charade would take. He thankfully had no family to worry about when he would eventually be dug into a ditch, but still, the idea of execution did not sound nice to him.\n\nThe slam of a gavel rang in his ears after two entire hours passed, and Frederick let out a breath he didn't realize he was keeping in for so long. Being roughly picked up by two guards, he felt a tremor go down his back. Shit - this was really happening, wasn't it? He was about to be brought out to the back to be executed like a dog, by people whose ideology he could share common ground with. A National Socialist executing another National Socialist. Frederick could only muster a shaky grin to himself as he closed his eyes, sending out a prayer to whatever deity was watching that some freak accident would happen.\n\nHe grunted when his body hit the dirt, and grit his teeth when he gave a single attempt at trying to break free of his restraints. There was too much ringing in his mind to hear whatever the hell was going outside of the confines of the bag on his head, and his uneven breaths bothered him. What did he say before? That he was an agent of the Reich? That he would lay his life down on the line? Well, now he was, in the most literal sense possible. Frederick found that a bit ironic, actually. So ironic that his lips parted as teeth bared themselves.\n\nToo bad he never got the time to let out a chuckle."
 speerdenmark.11.a:0 "It seems that the Danish have denied the ultimatum."

 speerdenmark.12.t:0 "Denmark Accepts"
 speerdenmark.12.d:0 "Frederick felt groggy in this cell. Perhaps it was the significantly different change of pace that he was used to. Perhaps it was the fact that he was stripped of all his pride down to prisoner's clothing. And it might just be the fact that he was about to get sent to his death. Who knows? Frederick sure as hell didn't, stuck in here and unavailable to hear news to the rest of the world. By the time the next morning came, he felt hungry, thirsty, and sure as hell annoyed. He knew how this trial would conclude, so what was taking them so long?!\n\nThe answer came in the form of a knock on his cell that caught his attention. "Herr Frederick," the man in the uniform said, drawing each syllable out. "Yes, what is it? Am I finally getting the bullet? Or am I reaching the chamber first before that happens?" He sarcastically bit back, standing up to his feet and staring at what looked like to be his jailor. "No, Herr Frederick. You are getting released.", "What?", "You heard me correctly. You are being released. Do I have to repeat this to you again?"\n\n"No... you don't." He wasn't willing to admit it openly, but a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders when he heard that he wasn't about to go six feet under. "Why, however?" The jailor stared at him with a mixture of boredom and disgust. "Your Führer has, to put it bluntly, threatened to invade our nation if we did not release you all and join your Pakt." He could almost feel the sneering expression from here. "I hope you are happy. Now," he began, plugging a key into the entrance. "Get out." He finished, emphasizing it with a click as the door opened. With a massive grin that was quickly tempered by his want to not get beaten up by the guard, Frederick walked out feeling like a new man. Though, something crossed his mind when he took the first step beyond bars."
 speerdenmark.12.a:0 "Can I get to keep that Karabiner I found... ?"

 speerdenmark.13.t:0 "The Coup Succeeds"
 speerdenmark.13.d:0 "Being in full uniform while laying down in an apartment bed was uncomfortable, Frederick noted. It was especially uncomfortable when he made the unwise decision of dragging cigarette smoke out of his mouth, resulting in a quick coughing fit as he struggled to sit up straight. Even after participating in open rebellion, nearly getting a bullet lodged into his brain, and explosions rocking him so hard he's likely going to lose his hearing by the time he was in his sixties, the German almost succumbed on the spot to one stupid decision. "The things that happen in life," he coughed out, mumbling to himself while he stared down at the wooden floor below. "That wouldn't have gotten me any medal of honor. Now where the hell-"\n\nThe banging on the door riddled with bullet holes made him jump in fright, reaching for his pistol and only stopping when he heard his native tongue being spoken. "Herr Frederick?" The voice called out. "Your car has arrived. I would suggest leaving immediately, as it would be best if we don't risk some rogue agent shooting up your vehicle." That made him crack a smile as he got up. He still kept the pistol at his side, however, just to be on the safe side. "I hope the Danes are not terrified of me when I step out.", "No, they-- Come on, Herr Frederick, if you want to be applauded for your efforts, you'll have time for it during the trip back to Germania.", "Fine, fine."\n\nDriving through the streets of Copenhagen now, once the violence had settled, felt strange to him. Surrounding the center of the city, Frederick could see clearly the aftereffects of what happened. Bloodied and burnt bodies with emptied-out weapons would be a common sight, with some places being warzones that he himself had to pass through. "So then, once I come home I believe I can safely say that I will be duly rewarded for my efforts," Frederick proudly spoke, staring out the car window while he talked. "The Führer will be most pleased to hear this news, after all, and I could see myself earning a raise in pay. Hmm... the possibilities." He turned to the driver who kept his focus narrow on the road. "Hey, what do you think will happen when I come home? Maybe they'll let me keep a souvenir gun at home? Ooh, I love bolt-action rifles. The noise they make when they shoot is so satisfying, and the click of the bolt...""
 speerdenmark.13.a:0 "The road back was long and arduous. Except for Frederick."

 ## Holland Events
 speerholland.1.t:0 "Meeting with the Dutch"
 speerholland.1.desc:0 "There is much reason for Germany to rejoice, with the civil war over, and the heart of the Reich secured under the banner of its new leader, Albert Speer. For the reunification of the Volk, however, there remain many battles still to be won. The Germanic people of Europe are divided, scattered across the continent, a stark contrast to Hitler's grand alliance system, and a definite liability to the new regime in Germania. To the west, Germany's brothers in Holland have yet to rejoin the Pakt, leaving both the Vaterland and the Netherlands in a precarious position.\n\nFor the new Führer, and Foreign Minister Schmidt, reentry of Holland has become a diplomatic priority, and negotiations with [HOL.GetLeader] and the rest of the Hague are being planned. Within Speer's cabinet, there is much uncertainty about the coming meeting, but on the outside, Germany's head of state is all smiles and waves for the people. He reaffirmed this confidence to the public before he and his plane departed from Germania, ensuring the Völkischer Beobachter a quote for their headline:\n\n"The Dutch know where their blood belongs.""
 speerholland.1.a:0 "Gute Reise, mein Führer!"

 speerholland.2.t:0 "Germanic Brotherhood"
 speerholland.2.desc:0 "Was he certain once? He was certain he wasn't now. Decades under the doctrine of any belief can push the faith of any man, especially the smart ones, and, if anything, Speer certainly considered himself clever.\n\nIt was precisely this intelligence which commanded Speer to appeal to the Dutch reactionaries through race in his negotiations. In a speech to a collection of statesmen in the political capital of the Netherlands, the Führer connected the philosophical genius of the Dutch Descartes and Voetius, with the German Leibniz and Goethe. He connected the diplomatic centrality of the Hague with Bismarck's focus on alliances and peace. Both nations, Speer went on, shared a common history of honourable monarchies and fair republics, feudal states and global empires. Truly, there was a unique and profound link, at the level of blood, that connected the Dutch and the Germans in a genetic brotherhood. At this conclusion, a raucous applause erupted from the gathered crowd in the Binnenhof.\n\nSpeer wasn't certain about the Jews, but he was certain that Europe did have an inferior subhuman infesting it. The proud Aryans of Speer's homeland clung onto every word of Germanic superiority that emerged from their Führer's mouth. A million conservative ears, from Amsterdam to Danzig, fixated on his voice in their radios and television sets. Like pigs, the true untermenschen of the Reich lapped up Speer's lies."
 speerholland.2.a:0 "We're brothers in race."

 speerholland.3.t:0 "Wooing the Dutch"
 speerholland.3.desc:0 "It was in his negotiations that Speer realised he had underestimated the Dutch. Dealing with a nation built on foundational traditions of economic, diplomatic and trading expertise was not, he discovered, a walk in the park. To woo the Dutch, Speer (after some amount of stern lecturing and heated argumentation originating from one Ludwig Erhard) elected to offer them economic subsidies. Instead of the immediate acceptance he had hoped for, the German Führer was met with the smiling faces of the Dutch ministry, reliably followed by Erhard sending Speer a responsive glare. They demanded more. Much more.\n\nSpeer was faced with a decision. He could cave and hand the Dutch their favoured subsidies, which would curry favour in the Hague and guarantee them joining the Pakt, but harm both Germany's treasury and the Führer's legitimacy. On the other hand, Speer could refuse, try to call the Hague's bluff, while maintaining his image and his resources, but reducing the potential sympathies of the Netherlands for the Pakt, and certainly alienating Germany from Holland's favour"
 speerholland.3.a:0 "Accept their demands, pay the full subsidies."
 speerholland.3.b:0 "Call their bluff, make it clear what we're willing to give."

 speerholland.4.t:0 "An Agreement Reached"
 speerholland.4.desc:0 "Stern gazes and tight handshakes in the Hague today, as the Führer and the Netherlands have finally come to a compromise surrounding the matter of subsidies. Formalities abound, with [HOL.GetLeader] and Speer engaging in all the manners of true Germanic statesmen. An image of the two is to cover the front page of the Völkischer Beobachter, the leaders smiling, their arms around each other. It will make for a good headline and an excellent symbol for the renewed unity of the nations.\n\nThese are just the necessary appearances, however; neither the Dutch nor the Germans are entirely pleased with the outcome. In any event, with an imperfect agreement reached, the negotiations are almost ready to conclude..."
 speerholland.4.a:0 "Politics is not an exact science."

 speerholland.5.t:0 "They Always Want More..."
 speerholland.5.desc:0 "Word from the Hague is that the Führer's scheme has failed. Outwitting the Dutch proved too much for Germania's new cabinet, and on top of this, Holland has demanded more than their initial subsidy request. With Erhard fuming, it looks like there is no choice for Speer but to concede defeat and agree with the new demands. The Netherlands are guaranteed to return into the fold once more, but at the loss of Germany's dignity, the treasury's wallet, and the Führer's eardrums, once Erhard is through with them."
 speerholland.5.a:0 "Gott verdammt!"

 speerholland.6.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 speerholland.6.desc:0 "After a long, and not in the slightest easy process, Holland has reentered the Pakt. Ceremonies are being held in Germania, the Hague, Amsterdam, and elsewhere across the two nations. The papers are decorated with messages of Aryan brotherhood, while the streets are adorned with the twin banners of the Prinsenvlag and the Swastika, flailing together in the wind.\n\nHolland and the Reich are now themselves flailing together in the wind. In a hostile world still haunted by Hitler's ghost, one more ally for the new Reich is far from taken for granted by the Führer. This new development has not saved him from the punishment of returning home, however. Erhard has developed quite the list of criticisms for the Führer's handling of the subsidy situation, with the plane from the Hague to Germania providing just enough time to go through them. Unlike his economic counterpart, Schmidt has little say on the matter for now.\n\nSpeer is scarcely paying attention to either. As the plane lifts off Dutch soil, the Führer stares out over the cityscape as it fades into the countryside. The old man sighs. One more nation, he thinks."
 speerholland.6.a:0 "Heims in Reich."

 speerholland.7.t:0 "The Madmen to the West"
 speerholland.7.desc:0 "In the absence of Germania's oversight, the Dutch have fallen into a particularly vile mode of governmental insanity. The Schutzstaffel have seized control of Holland, and have begun emulating the program of their brethren in Burgundy. In place of the old Reichkomissariat, the Himmlerite system has spread to cover the whole of the Low Countries. Speer was no thrall to the Nazi doctrine of the German heartland, and had moments of sincere doubt about the party's racial ideology. There was no doubt, however, that whatever the faults of the Reich, the wholesale slaughter and enslavement of good Germanic men and women being committed by the new Dutch regime were crimes of a uniquely wicked breed.\n\nKiesinger and Speer talk quietly with each other just outside the Reichstag's main hall. They are facing away from the rest of the cabinet, pointing and muttering about a piece of paper the Führer is gripping. His speech. The two old men exchange a glance of reassurance, before Kiesinger gives his leader a pat on the back, and follows Speer out in front of the crowd.\n\nSpeer took pride in the Volkshalle. It was a magnificent building, and the Führer considered it as much a symbol of his own expertise as the purported Volk it symbolised. He gazed out at the hundreds of faces that comprised the reichstag, placing his speech on the podium before him.\n\n"In our time of crisis," he began, "it seems our enemies have taken advantage of Germany's distracted might. The madmen to the West spread their tendrils, and if this cancer is left unchecked, it will form a malignant growth, the type that would fell lesser nations. We are not, however, a lesser nation. The German people will not fall silent while our brothers and sisters are murdered in Holland. As I speak, our brave Wehrmacht is moving across the Dutch border, and we will not halt until the Reich's flag flies over Amsterdam."

 speerholland.8.t:0 "We've Got Work To Do"
 speerholland.8.desc:0 "Speer had promised a war and a war he had won. Like the Romans of old, Speer enjoys some form of a triumphal parade in Germania, as the citizens of his Reich celebrate victory over Holland. Speer was a reformist, perhaps, but that did not mean he could not appreciate the finer pleasures of a Führer.\n\nFor Speer, this celebration was momentary. The Reich now occupied foreign territory, but could not retain military oversight forever. The Dutch would have their nation back, reintegrated into the Pakt, and with a stronger bond to Germania than before. The Chancellery, the Volkshalle and the Hague are now moving in sync with unity of purpose. The long march to civilian rule in the Netherlands has begun."
 speerholland.8.a:0 "Nous Maintiendrons"

 speerholland.9.t:0 "A Propaganda Campaign"
 speerholland.9.desc:0 "Speer tapped his pen against his closed mouth, alone in the Chancellery office. The Führer's brow is furrowed. Holland is back in the Reich, yes, and the various ministries and state apparatus of Germany are working day-in-day-out in the reconstitution of the Netherlands. The land of the Dutch has been seized, but Speer knows that their hearts and minds are yet to be won. The Spartan ideology clouds their thoughts, and after any stint of SS rule, the citizenry may feel that their loyalties lie more in Ost-Paris than Germania.\n\nSpeer picks up the phone, and dials for Kiesinger. The tone fades into the Deputy Führer's familiar silvery tones. Speer speaks. "Kurt, I need you to rally some support in the Volkshalle. I want a propaganda campaign in Holland, in support of our government of course. Yes, posters, radio broadcasts, television shows, just get whatever you can get from the good folks in the party. You can do that? Thank you Kurt. Take care."\n\nThe Führer puts the phone down, and gazes out onto the Chancellery lawn."
 speerholland.9.a:0 "Peace is hell."

 speerholland.10.t:0 "Finding the Perfect Leadership"
 speerholland.10.desc:0 "The reports coming in from the Hague look promising. Holland's citizenry are giving growing approval in surveys across the country, notably a growing enthusiasm for the conduct of the Unity Pakt and confidence in the Netherlands' place inside it. The Volkshalle, of course, can barely contain its enthusiasm at the news. It seems that the propaganda campaign was a glowing success.\n\nRumour round the informed circles of Germania is that Schmidt and Speer are to meet in the Chancellery this afternoon. With the prospects looking better, the foreign minister and the Führer will be discussing who to nominate for leadership of the newly reintegrated low countries."
 speerholland.10.a:0 "How exciting!"

 speerholland.11.t:0 "A Return to Civilian Rule"
 speerholland.11.desc:0 "Even amongst the rough humanity presented by the Nazi party, Speer can always find a way. It was not just him, to be fair. The perfect leadership for Holland would not have been found without the help of Kiesinger and Schmidt, sure. Speer knew, however, that his vision had paved the way, and now with good men loyal to the Reich moving toward the Hague, Germania was one step closer towards its former glory.\n\nIn Holland, civilian government is slowly but surely being returned. The propaganda campaign and the leadership team have proved themselves remarkably. Now, as the military administration is dismantled, all traces of the SS have been removed. An operation successful, if the Führer did say so himself."

 speerslovakia.1.t:0 "Gateway to the Balkans"
 speerslovakia.1.d:0 "To the South of Germany, bordering our territories in Schlesien and Mähren, lie the Carpathian Mountains. This great wall of rock caged the newly unified Hungary in the 9th Century, and before that had been the barrier that even the great Romans could not reach before being halted in their Eastern expansion. It is a bulwark, and a blight on our influence in the Balkans, and beyond.\n\nThere is a solution here, albeit a simple one. Winning over Slovakia would bypass the Carpathians and give the Reich a wider border with Hungary. Additionally, the reintegration of Slovakia into the Pakt would regain Germany an old ally, increasing our legitimacy in the eyes of both the public, and abroad. Considering this, the Führer has sent an ultimatum to Bratislava; rejoin the Pakt or face invasion."
 speerslovakia.1.a:0 "Seems an obvious choice."
 
 speerslovakia.2.t:0 "An Ultimatum from the North"
 speerslovakia.2.d:0 "Slovakia has received an envoy from the German foreign ministry; they are demanding that we either rejoin their Unity-Pakt or accept invasion. A damning choice if ever there was one.\n\nOn the one hand, we have little choice, with the German Heer far outweighing our own standing army and our extensive border with them allowing a swift invasion on their part. On the other, we would essentially be forfeiting much of our international sovereignty, both economic and political, and our population might not see eye to eye with us on choosing Germania's path."
 speerslovakia.2.a:0 "Cave to the beast. Better bloodless servitude than futile war."

 speerslovakia.4.t:0 "Bratislava Refuses"
 speerslovakia.4.d:0 "The fools in Slovakia have gone against Germania's gracious offer. Our diplomats have returned to Germania empty-handed; Slovakia intends on defying the Reich.

 ###Ostland events###
 speer.900.t:0 "The Rank And File"
 speer.900.d:0 "Ostland is secured once again, and even now our men began the arduous task of restoring order to the war-torn region. The new regime that has been put in place is already reporting record numbers of enemy combatants- either surrendering, engaging our forces, or being caught fleeing the country. Most importantly, however, is the question of what we do with the captured soldiers.\n\nThese men- soldiers who fought under the regime of Otto-Heinrich Drechsler- are predominantly lower-ranking officers, such as lieutenants and sergeants. However, these men have committed treason- a crime punishable with anything up to death. To try them as traitors would certainly drive our point home and shore up our positions, but would also deprive the Heer of experienced, loyal soldiers. Meanwhile, pardoning these men would weaken our case and benefit the reactionaries, but these men would certainly be useful within our ranks. The decision falls to Albert Speer."
 speer.900.a:0 "Pardon them. They're not the men responsible."
 speer.900.b:0 "No mercy for traitors."

 speer.901.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speer.901.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation.\n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it. He's maintained that you were the best choice as Führer since his uprising began. No doubt he'll be eager to rejoin the Reich."\n\n"No doubt."\n\nSchmidt had expected more - wasn't Speer pleased? "With your permission I will send him an invitation to Germania. I'll handle the negotiations for Ostland's handover personally."\n\n"Yes... and no. I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speer.901.a:0 "As you wish."

 speer.902.t:0 "The Eastern Question"
 speer.902.d:0 "By god, but Landrut could talk. Since his arrival in Germania he had been gushing to Speer about this reform and that, barely giving him a chance to get a word in edgeways. Albert preferred it that way however. It gave him a better chance to determine what sort of man he truly was - an idealist who believed in democracy, or a pragmatist choosing his words to obtain popular support. A dangerous element to be removed, or a man he could work with. His fingers toyed at the button beneath his desk as Landrut went on and on. A single push, and the guards outside would have Landrut in a cell within seconds. His advisors would be furious to find out he had arrested a reformist ally, but he could certainly do with some credit from the more conservative elements of the party. Landrut seemed to have noticed his contemplation, for he stopped his waffling for a moment. "Mein Führer? Is something wrong?""
 speer.902.a:0 "This idiot really believes what he says. Press the button."
 speer.902.b:0 "He can be trusted to act in his own self interest."

 speer.903.t:0 "A Disappointing Meeting"
 speer.903.d:0 ""Mein Führer? Is something wrong?" Speer was broken from his reverie when Landrut ceased his speech. Andreas had been expecting... well, he hadn't been quite sure, but he had expected some response to his plans. Surely the man would be champing at the bit to incorporate his ideas, some of the only truly reformist ideas in the Reich - apart from his own, of course. Instead, he had just listened.\n\n"My apologies Andreas, I simply have a lot on my mind. It is good to find a true ally in these trying times. I am grateful for your work in Ostland, and now that it has been restored to the Reich we can get to work with our plans."\n\nWith that the Führer clearly considered the meeting over, as he rose and extended his hand. Meyer-Landrut clasped it in a firm grip, and shook it with enthusiasm.\n\n"Of course - the Führer's work is never done. Heil Speer!" He extended his arm in salute. When there was no response, he opened the door, chastened.\n\nOutside the door were half a dozen hulking OrPo officers, each one with their eyes locked on Andreas. He gulped. Surely, he didn't warrant such measures? He did his best to ignore the fact that they had their hands on their holstered pistols, and made his way out."
 speer.903.a:0 "Why does it feel like I have cheated death?"

 speer.904.t:0 "Idealism is a Fool's Game"
 speer.904.d:0 ""Herr Meyer-Landrut, you are under arrest for treason against the acting Reichskommissar of Ostland."\n\nMeyer-Landrut's mouth hung agape as the doors behind Speer opened with a crash, and half a dozen OrPo agents stormed into the room. As he tried to rise, his head was instead slammed against the table and handcuffs forced onto his wrists.\n\n"Mein Führer, I don't understand? I thought you were -" Whatever he was about to say was cut off as a bag was forced over his head. As he was frogmarched from the room, Speer didn't spare him a glance, instead contemplating the glass in his hand. Another traitor dealt with."

 speerostland.6.t:0 "Dinner in Riga"
 speerostland.6.d:0 "Schmidt was already seated when Stahlecker entered the restaurant. The foreign minister stood, extending a hand. "Herr Stahlecker. A pleasure." The Reichskommissar grimaced and took Schmidt's hand before sitting.\n\n"Now, I assume you understand why we've called these negotiations. Germania is interested in returning Ostland into the Reich after our unfortunate separation. Are there any particular conditions your government is interested in?"\n\nStahlecker eyed the man opposite him carefully. "I would like to keep my position as Reichsminister in your new Ostland. And I would like immunity for my men. These are my requests."\n\n"One moment, Herr Stahlecker, I need to take a call."\n\nSpeer was on the other end of the line, and Schmidt relayed the information. The Führer and the foreign minister were faced with two choices. On the one hand, accepting Stahlecker's demands might ease the negotiation process and appease the existing regime there. On the other, a show of force and denial of Stahlecker's requests would appease the conservatives in the Party, and demonstrate Speer's courage and power as Führer. Speer pondered the options, and made his decision, hanging up the phone."
 speerostland.6.a:0 "Accept the demands. The less blood, the better."
 speerostland.6.b:0 "Push Stahlecker further. We're the Reich, not him."

 speerostland.7.t:0 "Investigating Insurgents"
 speerostland.7.d:0 ""Herr Stahlecker, the Führer is unable to fully grant one of your requests." The Reichskommissar eyed Schmidt sternly. "In good news, the majority of your said conditions can be guaranteed."\n\n"What is the catch, Herr Schmidt."\n\n"Your lower cabinet members will need to be investigated for security purposes. They may pose a considerable threat to the government in Germania, due to their links with the traitorous Bormann. I'm sure you understand that, in these trying times, the safety, wellbeing and stability of the Reich's people are of utmost importance to the Führer, and we can't be taking any major risks." Schmidt forced a smile. "For the good of the country, Herr Stahlecker."\n\nThe Ostlander stared at the table, grimacing. Schmidt observed him, wondering what thoughts lay behind those half glazed eyes."
 speerostland.7.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.8.t:0 "A Begrudging Acceptance"
 speerostland.8.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "I mean no disrespect, Herr Schmidt, but the past is the past. These are good men. Any grievances they may have had with your people can surely be overcome peacefully."\n\n"Herr Stahlecker, I appreciate your concern for your fellow Germans. Really, it is an honourable trait to have. As I said, however, the times cannot call for the sort of leniency that may have otherwise been desirable. In an ideal world, I would agree with you. Let bygones be bygones. The Führer, however, does not orchestrate an Elysium. We are building it, and we cannot allow workers who might pour sugar into our concrete. The new Germany needs stability."\n\nAnother long silence, before Stahlecker finally spoke."Okay. I will comply."\n\nSchmidt smiles warmly. "Thank you, Reichskommissar. One moment, please. I have to take this call.""
 speerostland.8.a:0 "Our negotiations push for more concessions, the man seems agreeable."

 speerostland.9.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "Do you remember what we saw out there, Herr Schmidt? During the war? You weren't there for long, were you?"\n\n"Herr Stahlecker-"\n\n"I won't be coddled or convinced with a 'Herr', Schmidt." Stahlecker leant forward and stood slightly, pressing his palms into the table as he stared directly into the foreign minister's eyes.\n\n"We saw a countryside littered with Jewry and Bolshevism. We saw a land once roamed by our German and Baltic forefathers corrupted with the burning greed and degeneracy of the Slavic swine. It was disgusting, Schmidt. It was horrifying. When we cleansed it, we liberated the land from it's filth. Yet we did not go far enough."\n\nStahlecker stood up from the table. "Ostland has been through a civil war, and my men won it. We fought the forces of Jewry and Bolshevism with a loyalty to the party, and to the ideas of Hitler and National Socialism. Bormann, Bormann represented those loyalties. You, and that fraudulent Führer of yours, would return Ostland to these devils. My men, they have committed crimes by the standard of your petty courts. They loved Bormann. Under your false laws, they are guilty, but under God, they are innocent."\n\nThe Reichskommissar, before Schmidt could respond, had walked out the door. In the heavens, the drums of war began to beat."
 speerostland.9.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.10.t:0 "A Second Demand"
 speerostland.10.d:0 "Schmidt put down the phone. His eyes had already communicated enough information to Stahlecker for a single glance to turn the Reichskommissar into a daze of despair. "Herr Stahlecker, the Führer has requested that the investigations might widen their scope."\n\nStahlecker sighed audibly. "I understand your reservations about this, but you must understand that the Reich cannot afford any chances at any level of government, especially the higher levels. Think of what one disloyal minister could do. Fraudulent documents, leaked information; sabotage at these levels could ruin the Reich."\n\nIn the Reichskommissar's head, thoughts were buzzing. His men were being threatened. This regime, this new Germany, this new Führer, they didn't care about him or his people. But did he have a choice? If he didn't comply, then what? The Heer would simply storm the border, and his government would be wiped off the face of the planet. Besides, Schmidt hadn't mentioned anything about him being put on trial himself..."

I understand how difficult this must be for you, but it is in all Germany's best interest. Excuse me for one moment, I need to take this call...""
 speerostland.11.a:0 "Give the man a break. A peaceful transition is now more than possible."

 speerostland.12.t:0 "A Bridge Too Far"
 speerostland.12.d:0 "Stahlecker glared at Schmidt. A palpable rage stretched across the man's face as he did so, breaking the facade of courtesy he had built up over the course of the negotiation. "You would have every German in Ostland hung for treason, Herr Schmidt. Your 'reformists' in Germania are no better than the savages of Burgundy."\n\nThe Reichskommissar stood, Schmidt staring in a frozen awe. "When Bormann fell, so did the last hope for the Reich. Your petty Führer doesn't deserve to even be called a German."\n\nWith a mild flourish of his coat, Stahlecker turned and left the room. Above the room and across Yggdrasil, the drums of war in Asgard began to beat. In the quiet of the negotiations chamber, Schmidt could hear them, just barely. A sign from the gods of more to come."

 speerostland.13.t:0 "A Final Demand"
 speerostland.13.d:0 "The phone hit the shelf, and Schmidt returned to the table. "A final issue to iron out, Herr Stahlecker." By the tone in his voice, almost forcefully gentle, Stahlecker understood what Schmidt was about to say. "The Führer requests that you undergo a trial, a fair one, just to ensure Germania understands your past. I personally trust that you would remain quiet loyal to the Reich, Herr Reichskommissar, but to secure the doubts in my government, I would recommend this path."\n\nStahlecker's depressed expression morphed into something of an abject terror. "I would keep in mind, Herr Stahlecker, that refusal to comply with these demands may end with more trouble for you and your government than compliance.""

I invited you here to discuss our options. You'll be leading a diplomatic envoy to the East to deal with the situation there. Any ideas?"\n\nSchmidt shuffled in his seat. "Well, my Führer..." His voice trailed off.\n\n"I'm listening, Schmidt."\n\n"I think it would be best to negotiate with Stahlecker. It might win us favour with the conservatives and give a show of force by punishing the traitor. We could force him into a harsh agreement and reintegrate Ostland back into the Reich that way. An enemy gone, territory gained and our friends in the Party might look at us with kinder eyes."\n\nSpeer stared into middle distance, thinking, but slowly nodding in approval. Schmidt couldn't help a slight, genuine smile at the peaceful route being favoured. "Or," Speer began, "we might declare war immediately. Rally the support of the reformists in a direct action and put him down quickly and effectively."\n\nSchmidt's expression morphed into something more familiarly depressed as he slouched in his chair. He let out a short and inaudible sigh. "It's your choice, my Führer."\n\n"Indeed. It is.""

 speerostland.18.t:0 "Drechsler In Ostland"
 speerostland.18.d:0 ""Otto-Heinrich Drechsler. Militarist, expansionist, traitor, and victor." Speer read the report slowly, carefully taking in every detail. He knew Drechsler from his experience before the Burgerkrieg. The man was a paranoid coward, constantly itching for a fight, being a general pain. It was a surprise he'd never been disposed of.\n\nAnd yet, even as he caused problems in the east. Speer realized something. Drechsler was the perfect heel. Not only was he a traitor, but he was a militarist. Somehow, in losing- apparently, there had been a reformist in the Ostland chaos at some point- Speer had won more than he ever could have expected. A perfect target, a perfect ball and chain to tie to the reactionaries. Even if it would benefit the Gang as much as it benefited him, Speer was more than willing to make that sacrifice. Soon, Ostland would be under German control again, and the face of the traitors- along with their military ranks- would be plastered across every newspaper in Germany."
 speerostland.18.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.19.t:0 "Vituska In Ostland"
 speerostland.19.d:0 ""So, who is this Michal Vituska?" Speer read the report with interest, looking between it and Schmidt slowly, his eyes glancing over the little information that the paper provided.\n\n"We aren't entirely sure, Albert." Schmidt said with a sigh. "His past is. . .well, murky would be an understatement. What we know about him is that he's been a loyal collaborator with a lot of luck- at least, up until the Burgerkrieg, where he broke away from the Reichskommissariat to form a Central European Council, as he calls it. He's the dominant power in Ostland today."\n\n"And you said he was willing to negotiate?" Albert's eyes pored over the papers. Vituska's history was interesting, to say the least. A number of strange events and coincidences had brought him to the position of power he had held before Ostland broke down- definitely something that raised his eyebrow. Perhaps the man was more clever than he seemed.\n\n"Yes, he's said he's willing to cooperate. Shall I send an invitation?" Schmidt said. Speer nodded, and the Foreign Secretary made his exit. The Fuhrer put down his paper- there were certainly worse possible outcomes."
 speerostland.19.a:0 "We'll see what he wants."

 speerostland.20.t:0 "Meeting The Man"
 speerostland.20.d:0 "Michel Vituska entered Speer's office with a hearty "Heil!" and a quick salute, taking his seat with haste. Speer cocked his head- whether the man was nervous or enthusiastic, he couldn't tell. He took a breath before beginning. "Herr Vituska, thank you for accepting these negotiations. I trust you know why we're here?"\n\n"Yes, of course." Vituska quickly said, fidgeting in his chair a little. Speer's eyebrow raised a little- for a skilled leader, Vituska definitely seemed a little worried. Maybe it was the stakes. He disregarded it.\n\n"Now, I understand you had a few requests in exchange for rejoining the Reich, yes?" Speer said calmly. Vituska fidgeted a little more in his seat before he began.\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer. I would request to retain my role as Reichskommisar of Ostland, in exchange for my continued collaboration. In addition to this, I would similarly ask for the restrictions that Germany currently holds over Ostland to be relaxed, if not removed. With these two caveats, I'd be more than happy to peacefully rejoin the Reich."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows furrowed, his face betraying confusion, anger, and bemusement all at the same time. "You've come all this way to ask me to give you almost unimpeded control over one of the Reich's most valuable territories?"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't put it like that." Vituska said. Speer scoffed. What a waste of time."

 speerostland.21.d:0 ""Herr Vituska, you must be joking. Even if I wanted to- and I don't- can you imagine the damage of giving a Slav control of a Reichskommissariat? I'd be laughed out of the Reichstag. It can't be done." Speer's tone had taken on an almost incredulous tilt. He half expected Vituska to laugh and explain that it was all a joke. He didn't.\n\n"Herr Speer, these are my conditions. If you do not accept them, these talks must adjourn. "Vituska said. His earlier nervousness was gone, replaced with a steely look. As foolish as Speer considered the man, he had to admit that he had a lot of nerve. It would not save him.\n\n"Well, Herr Vituska, if these talks are adjourned, I have no choice but to mark you a traitor, which means. . ." Three guards entered the room, their weapons at the ready. Speer watched Vituska closely for his reaction. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion when the man smiled.\n\n"You didn't think he'd actually come to this meeting in person, did you?"\n\nSpeer froze for a moment, before reaching for the photograph of Vituska he had on his desk and holding it up to the man's face. At a glance, they seemed to match, but further inspection proved it- this was not the same person. He threw the photo down and sighed.\n\n"Son of a bitch.""

 speerostland.22.t:0 "Kovner In Ostland"
 speerostland.22.d:0 "During the Bürgerkrieg, chaos consumed much of Europe. Perhaps the most chaotic of these battlegrounds was not found in Frankfurt, or Saxony, but rather in Ostland. Ostland, once designed as "The Model Colony", proved that moniker to be a falsehood, as it fell to pieces within days of the Reich's own failure. Six sides burst from the unsteady Reichskommissariat, each fighting over the future of the area.\n\nStunningly, the United Partisan Organization, led by noted terrorist and murderer Abba Kovner, has come out on top of Ostland. This is an unmitigated disaster for us- not only because of Kovner's well-known Anti-German sentiment, but because of the political implications this holds. Already, conservatives in the Reichstag have made hay with this issue, attempting to tie our reformist views to this outcome. While this is unquestionably false, it's caught on in some circles, and our influence is bound to take a hit. Best to make short work of this and move on as fast as we can."
 speerostland.22.a:0 "What a mess."

 speerostland.23.t:0 "The Ostland Intervention"
 speerostland.23.d:0 "Speer's face paled as he read through the report. He was alone- there was no need for Schmidt, nor for anyone else in the Gang. No, this was an open-and-shut decision. An invasion was the only option for such a madman as Abba Kovner.\n\nThe reports chilled his blood to even look at. Stories of German soldiers being executed, German civilians being shot regularly, soldiers hanging from trees and lampposts- it was enough to make anyone retch. Such depraved brutality could not and would not be tolerated by the Reich.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the fastest the Reich's bureaucracy had moved since the Second World War. Within hours, divisions pushed across the Ostland border, engaging partisan forces wherever they found them. Each of them had two goals, and two goals only- push through Ostland as fast as possible, and save as many settlers as they could."

 speerostland.24.d:0 "Few names provoke such strong reactions in Germany as the name Schutzstaffel. Most react with hate, some with fear, some others with disgust. No matter who you ask, however, you're almost guaranteed to hear a tale of their brutality. One of the most widely reviled organizations in German history, the hope was that, with their defeat in the Burgerkrieg, they would be permanently banished to Burgundy to rot.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case.\n\nElements of the Ostland SS, led by Friedrich Jeckeln, have managed to seize control over Ostland, and are ruling with a fist of iron. Their maniacal ideology must be put down with extreme prejudice, effective immediately. On the political front, this development has aided the reformist wing of the party immeasurably, seeing as they've made numerous successful comparisons between the conservative wing of the Party and the SS. In any case, the intervention must happen, and it must happen soon, or there may be no Ostland to return to."

Their factions are still locked in combat with each other- six of them at start. That number has since been reduced."\n\nSpeer nodded. "Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\nSchmidt sighed. "There was, my Fuhrer, but his faction has been crushed. Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the industrialist. He gave it his best shot, but. . . well, he didn't succeed."\n\nSpeer grunted. "And there's nobody else there we could work with?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well." Speer looked out his window. "That's a pain, isn't it? Get the troops ready. We'll intervene, restore order, and go from there."\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." And in a moment, Schmidt was gone."

"Andreas Meyer-Landrut, a major industrialist in the region, has led a faction of reformists through the struggle. He's held his own quite well. Currently, he is the only faction I believe we could truly negotiate with."\n\nSpeer smiled. "Perfect. Organize an intervention. We'll move in, secure the region, and then take over for the man. It'll run like clockwork."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer." Schmidt said, with a smile on his face. It seemed both men were quite pleased with this result."

"My Fuhrer, what an honor to meet you!" Landrut said amicably, his smile not leaving his face. Speer returned it.\n\n"Yes, Herr Landrut, you've truly done the Reich a service. Without you, this whole operation would be much more of a pain than it currently is. I can't thank you enough."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer. It was no trouble, really. I trust that this new administration will continue our efforts?"\n\n"Well, Herr Landrut, I need you to sign this first. Make it official and all." The two men stopped by a table with a paper on hand. Landrut took a pen and, still smiling, signed it. Speer smiled.\n\n"We can't thank you enough for your cooperation, Herr Landrut. Rest assured that Ostland will reform just as much as anywhere else in the Reich.""

 speer_moskowien.3.t:0 "God Help Me, I Was Only 19" #Start of German Soldier Event Chain
 speer_moskowien.3.d:0 "Matthäus Schornberger leaned his chair back on two legs and lit his cigarette. The smoke wafted lazily into the air before being suddenly sucked out of the room, dragged by the wind that blew through the opened window. He puffed thoughtlessly as he stared out the window, taking in his street on the west end of Fulda. His father would kill him if he found out he was smoking, which is why he had to do it up in his room on the third floor of their house, one level above the kitchen and two levels above his father's workshop, filled with the tools of a watchmaker. Of course, his father was much more than just a watchmaker- he was a hero, an Iron Cross recipient, first class. Though his father never flaunted it, he knew the neighbors knew it. You could see it in their enthusiastic greetings, their preference of his business over others, the favors and gifts they gave him. His father was a man that all, including Matthias, respected; a man who had stood up to the Judeo-Bolsheviks out east and obliterated them. He was a man to look up to.\n\nWhat did Matthäus have to look forward to in his life, anyhow? He had turned the question over and over in his mind for months now, and he still had no answer. Sure, he studied, as his father wished, but what was the point? The slaves did all the work that Germany needed already. Did he really want to waste what should be the greatest years of his life on a degree he would have no purpose for, just for a society that had no need for it?"
 speer_moskowien.3.a:0 "What's the use of it?"
 
 speer_moskowien.77.t:0 "Making Up His Mind"
 speer_moskowien.77.d:0 "The army, on the other hand, was where Matthäus saw his legacy being made. There, he could serve a purpose to his fatherland. He could come home and have the same respect his father had. He could be someone, do something, and come home a stronger, wiser man, just as his father had. Besides, he still remembered the war stories his father had told him back when he was a boy. They spoke of joy and camaraderie, of glorious victories over the Jews and Slavs, of a great triumph and the stories that accompanied it. That sounded much better to Matthäus than sitting around in an office twiddling his thumbs for the rest of his life.\n\nThe only thing that had been stopping him from rushing off to the recruitment office so far was, strangely enough, his father. Matthäus had floated the idea past him once and quickly learned not to make that mistake again. He'd never seen his father so angry. He'd made him promise he'd never go to the Heer, under any circumstances. Of course, Matthäus had promised- what else was he going to do?- but now he wondered why. He sat for a moment, the wind blowing through his room, deep in thought.\n\nSuddenly, he snuffed his cigarette out against the windowsill. He knew why his father was so angry about the mere thought of his son in the Heer- he didn't think he could do it. His father thinks he was too soft, did he? He thought he couldn't handle war, did he? He thought Matthäus couldn't handle responsibility or pressure, or having people depending on him. Matthäus knew it to be true- his father didn't seem to have much of a problem with telling his war stories, did he? Was he scared that his son could possibly upstage him, do more than even he could? Well, he was going to see it now. Matthäus was going to go into the army, and he was going to make his father wonder why he'd ever doubted him. He was going to make him sorry he'd ever even tried to stop him. He was going to be a soldier, and nothing was going to get in his way.\n\nFuriously, Matthäus scribbled out a farewell note and slapped it down on the kitchen table on his way to the door. While grabbing his coat, he turned around to savor the view of the house one more time. He was going to come back, and he was going to be more than his father could ever have dreamed of being.\n\nHe was going to be a hero."
 speer_moskowien.77.a:0 "Like Father, like son."


 speer_moskowien.4.t:0 "Crisp Uniform"
 speer_moskowien.4.d:0 "The wind swept Matthäus's hair to the side as he stood in front of the recruiting office. The cold, concrete building almost seemed to stare right back at him, looking straight through him. In front of the building stood two Heer members, dressed in full parade attire. SIlently, he made his way past them and into the building.\n\n"Heil Speer!" The recruiting officer, sitting neatly at his desk, snapped to his salute, an action Matthäus returned. "What can I do for you, sir?"\n\n"I'm looking to join the Heer, sir." Matthäus replied, confidently. He made sure to keep his chest out and chin up.\n\n"Good, good. Just sign these papers and go into that room back there. You'll find a uniform, a helmet, and we'll direct you onto a bus out of here shortly."\n\nMatthäus sat down in front of the table, the pen clicking in his hands. Multiple papers were set in front of him, each detailing oaths and promises. "I will be loyal to the Fuhrer and to Germany." "I will not falter in my duty to the Reich." "I will uphold and support my fellow soldier, and follow orders without question." Yes, yes, and yes. He soon began to stop reading the papers, simply signing where they asked him to. Finally, he moved on to the back room, where his uniform awaited him.\n\nCrisp, folded, and clean, the grey uniform sat among rows of other uniforms identical to it. A small part of Matthäus's mind told him that this would be the cleanest he'd ever see it. He grabbed one that fit him, trying on the tunic and pants. The helmet, clean and polished, didn't fit all that well, but Matthäus couldn't find one that fit better, so he took it. When he was ready, he marched proudly out of the room and into the back, taking a seat besides other, similarly uniformed recruits.\n\nWithin minutes, a bus pulled up to the office, and the men were loaded on. As the bus pulled away, Matthäus took one last look around the city he had called home all his life. A new chapter of his story was just beginning."
 speer_moskowien.4.a:0 "Just sign on the dotted line."
 
 speer_moskowien.5.t:0 "Harsh Reality"
 speer_moskowien.5.d:0 "Get over the wall, maggot!"\n\nMatthäus's legs swung and scratched helplessly at the bricks, his hands barely grasping onto the edge of the wall he dangles from. Below him, a small queue was beginning to pile up, men watching his every swing as he desperately struggled for any traction. Though he couldn't see him, he could already tell the drill sergeant was getting closer to him.\n\n"There's Russian machine guns behind you, boy! They're getting closer, they're gonna kill your squadmates if you don't get past that fucking wall, boy!" Soft chuckles from the men below him. What made the situation even more humiliating was that none of the men before him had many problems with getting up and over. It was Matthäus, and Matthäus alone, who was struggling so much with it. He tried to pull himself up and over again, to no avail.\n\n"They're on top of us now, boy! They're shredding us, boy, there's guts all over your legs, boy, get over that wall!" Matthäus was about ready to just let go and quit. He wasn't made out for this, clearly. His father had been right.\n\nThe thought stopped him in his tracks. His father, if he returned home, would be insufferable. He would be right that Matthäus wasn't strong enough for this. Matthäus could picture his dad cracking open a beer in his shop, saying to some curious customer, "I told him over and over to not go, but he did, and you know what happened? I was right, and he's back at home now. I tell you, they aren't made like they used to be, are they?"\n\nWith a final heave, Matthäus pushed over the wall and fell to the ground on the other side. The drill sergeant gave him shit, for sure, but he didn't hear it. He was still going. He was still a soldier."
 speer_moskowien.5.a:0 "It was a long march from cadets..."
 
 speer_moskowien.7.t:0 "The Fighting 16th"
 speer_moskowien.7.d:0 "The truck shook and rattled as it rolled along the autobahn, staying behind the truck in front of it. Matthäus knew where they were going, and it shook him a little bit. The convoy was headed to Danzig- the furthest Matthäus had ever been from Fulda was Germania, and that had only been once or twice. Fulda, and the area around it, had been all he had known. Shaking a little, he pulled his assignment orders out of his pocket, reading them over for what seemed to be the hundredth time. Everything was in order- He was on a truck to Danzig to join the 16th Infantry Division. He assumed the men around him were on the same journey. The 16th Infantry- not a division that Matthäus had heard of in passing, but name recognition didn't matter much.\n\nThe man next to him tapped him on the shoulder. "Hey." he said cautiously. "You're from Bachrain?"\n\n"Oh, yeah, I've lived there my whole life."\n\n"Me too." The man said. "Schornberger. . .I feel like I've heard the name. The watchmaker, right?"\n\n"Not me. That's my dad."\n\n"Oh, really? He's good at what he does. A soldier too, I've heard. You following in his footsteps?"\n\n"Not exactly." Matthäus laughed. The two men's conversation continued, and soon other men began to join in. Matthäus learned they were all going to the 16th as well, as he expected. Most were from around Fulda, if not the city itself, though there were some from other areas. One even said he was from Vienna. Soon, the squad became fast friends. It's hard not to like someone when you spend 3 hours of a boring truck ride talking to them. As Matthäus spoke, he knew that he'd truly found his calling. If only his father could see him now!"
 speer_moskowien.7.a:0 "Good men, all of them."
 
 speer_moskowien.6.t:0 "New Orders"
 speer_moskowien.6.d:0 "It was a normal day in Danzig, as the last six months had been. Matthäus lay in his bunk, daydreaming of going home. This wasn't the hero's life he had been promised. Indeed, the most action he had seen was an out of control truck crashing into the wall of the base a few months back. The rest of his time had been spent idly patrolling various parts of Danzig, from the docks to the barracks to the Governor's Palace. In general, it seemed like Matthäus would never become the same hero his father had been- not for lack of trying, but simply out of lack of opportunity.\n\nHis friend, a fellow named Johan, opened the door to the barrack and walked inside. "Guys, pack your shit. We're leaving in two hours, going out east." He yelled, to the complaint of those who were catching up to the sleep they had lost in the last few days. The barracks sleepily came alive, as man after man rolled out of their beds to put on their uniform. Matthäus did not move, instead thinking for a moment, before catching Johan's attention.\n\n"Johan, where are we going? What are we doing out east?"\n\n"We're being deployed. Apparently we're restoring order to the east, or some shit. I'm not clear on the details myself, but I know we're being deployed."\n\nMatthäus rushed from his bed, eager to get his pack ready. Finally, some action! He had been hoping for this day ever since he had joined the Heer. All the training, all the waiting, all the busywork- all had been leading up to these moments, where Matthäus could finally prove that, yes, he was able to do all the same work and more that his father did so many years ago. Within a few minutes, his personal items rested snugly in his pack. Matthäus, now dressed in his field greys, took one look at himself in the mirror on the wall before he marched outside to the trucks.\n\nHe looked quite nice. He looked natural. Above all else, he looked ready."
 speer_moskowien.6.a:0 "Things are picking up."
 
 speer_moskowien.8.t:0 "The Battle of Smolensk"
 speer_moskowien.8.d:0 "Matthäus's G1 rocked violently in his hands as he emptied the magazine down the street. All around him, his squadmates did their best to keep the fire going, ducking occasionally to avoid return fire. Matthäus ducked down again to reload, not even noticing the bullets that cracked the wall behind him. For now, his mind was solely focused on not dying, and serving his homeland. Even with his focus, and his attempts to keep composure, he could feel the manic feeling of terror slowly rising within him, as it had for almost an hour now. How long had they been fighting in this street for? How much ammo could they possibly have left, and what would happen if they ran out?\n\nFor now, however, those thoughts were quickly pushed away by a sharp tap from his NCO.\n\n"Schornberger! I need you to do some shit for us!" the man shouted, but whatever he shouted was drowned out by the next man over's yelling.\n\n"Holy shit! Johan just ate a fucking grenade up there!"\n\nMatthäus looked over the trench to the next foxhole, where his friend was noticeably absent. As he looked, however, he noticed movement in a ruined house, off to the left. None of his squadmates were in there- could a flanking attack be coming? A quick slap from the NCO brought him back to attention.\n\n"Like I was saying, Private, I need you to find a command element, tell them to give us reinforcements, supplies, something! We're running low! You hear me, private?""

 speer_moskowien.9.t:0 "The Red Badge of Courage."
 speer_moskowien.9.d:0 "Matthäus, without really even thinking about it, hopped over the wall and began his dash down the street. He didn't hear his NCO's shouting, whether it was positive or negative. All he heard was the thump of his own heart and the crackling of a machine gun, and suddenly the ground around him exploded in shards of stone and shrapnel as bullets crackled off the road around him. He didn't care, as long as they didn't hit him. By some divine miracle, or insane luck, they didn't. Matthäus managed to slide into the foxhole unscathed, slamming into the other wall from the sheer momentum he had carried. Quickly brushing himself off, he turned to find his friend.\n\nJohan was lying in a puddle of his own blood- a puddle that was now lapping around Matthäus's boots- with the look on his face of a rapidly dying man. His uniform, sliced to rags by the shrapnel, was now damp with blood from a thousand wounds. His arm, still holding his rifle, now lay severed behind him. As Matthäus watched in horror, Johan took one last look at him,eyes wide open, before finally falling silent.\n\nMatthäus was too terrified now to even throw up. His feeling of panic, which had been so well surpressed, now exploded just as ferociously as the grenade. In a blind moment of sheer terror, Matthäus scrabbled for the edge of the foxhole, looking for any means of escape, to run away, back past his line, out of Smolensk, all the way back to his house in Fulda.\n\nThe machine gun bullets cracked against the foxhole again, and Matthäus caught a stinging reminder of why the foxhole was there when one bullet grazed his fingers, sending him tumbling back into the blood puddle. Without covering fire, there was no way he could escape alive. Matthäus sank down against a wall, his eyes drawn to the corpse of what was once his friend. He couldn't look away. All he could do was sit and stare.\n\nThis wasn't at all like his father's stories."
 speer_moskowien.9.a:0 "Those eyes stared right back into him."
 
 speer_moskowien.10.t:0 "The Fastest Kid In The East"
 speer_moskowien.10.d:0 "With a jump, Matthäus was off, racing through the streets of Smolensk. Bullets cracked against the walls behind him, sending him stumbling into the next street. From there, he turned, running with his head down as he raced past corpses upon corpses. The screaming of the dying and the wounded rattled through his head as he ran, still looking for any sort of command element.\n\nFive blocks down, he stumbled into a makeshift hospital, hastily thrown together in the chaos of the fighting. He pushed through doctors tending to their patients, nurses carrying bodies off of beds and into a pile further away, and the occasionally walking wounded waiting for a table to open up. Finally, he broke free of the chaos, continuing his search.\n\nThe horrors of the battle he had fought through became more and more clear as he seemingly revisited them all on his path. On the way forward, it had been easy to ignore them, what with the battle and bullets flying everywhere. Now, on the way back, there was no haze to cover up the bodies, the blood, and the wreckage.\n\nEventually, Matthäus did find the command center. He barely even noticed himself monotonely requesting extra supplies for his position. When the commander heeded his request, sending men to relieve his unit, Matthäus hardly noticed. He instead sat down in a corner and tried to comprehend what he had seen."

 speer_moskowien.11.t:0 "If You Could Find It In Your Heart"
 speer_moskowien.11.d:0 "Matthäus gingerly entered the building, rifle ready in his hands. He noticed a slight shake to his aim- perhaps from adrenaline, perhaps from fear. The sounds of the battle roaring outside were now only muffled cracks and bangs reverberating through the walls. The house itself was dark- the electricity had been cut long ago- and the only light that filtered in came through cracks in the ceiling and walls. Matthäus's eyes strained to see clearly in the darkness as he slowly moved forwards.\n\nA whimper in the next room caught his attention, and Matthäus stopped dead in his tracks. He could hear faint breathing, labored and wheezing as it was. A small shuffle confirmed that the source of the noise was off to the right. Slowly, Matthäus steeled himself and popped around the corner.\n\nA beam of light illuminated a young Russian, no older than Matthäus himself, slick with blood. A picture lay in his right hand, a old rifle in his left. The two regarded each other for moment, neither moving a muscle, as if they shared a connection among the chaos of war.\n\nMatthäus raised his rifle and pumped six rounds into the boy, silencing his breaths. The picture fell from his hand, and Matthäus was barely able to make out the boy standing with his mother and father.\n\nMatthäus exited the house blankly, returning to the line. The Sergeant asked him if the building was clear, which Matthäus could only reply with a nod. Without another word, Matthäus returned to the line, firing the occasional shot down at the enemy."

 speer_moskowien.12.d:0 "The visions wouldn't stop.\n\nMatthäus tossed and turned in his bed, over and over, and they just wouldn't go away. The street, the battle,the things he had seen- all kept replaying in his head, like a long, terrible movie. He couldn't stop thinking about the crack of rifle fire, the screams of the wounded and dying, or the yelling of men who knew that, at any moment, they could be dead. After an hour of this torture, Matthäus resolved for another sleepless night. He quietly hopped out of his bunk, trudging to the bathroom. Perhaps he could fix himself there.\n\nOnce he got into the dim light of the bathroom, he took a long look at himself. A tired, unshaven face stared right back into his eyes. One simultaneously young in body but old in mind. Perhaps, with a few touch-ups and a good shave, he could look like the boy he once was, but one look into his own dull eyes was a surefire tell that he wasn't truly the boy from Fulda anymore.\n\nHe took a sip of water out of the sink, washing his face afterwards, before heading back to his bed. There, he lay down quietly, waiting for the sun to come up and a new day to start."

And he ran!"\n\nThe table erupted with laughter as the man finished his story, and Matthäus cracked a smile of his own. These were good people he had met- being new to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität was quite the overwhelming experience. Matthäus had managed, but it seemed he had finally met some people he could fit in with.\n\n"So that's how high school ended for me. Matthäus, you're the new one here. What did you do before University?"\n\n"I, ah. . ." Mathaus paused for a moment. How would they react? Should he be honest? Christ, they're all looking at him now. No time to think.\n\n"I served with the Heer out east, in Smolensk."\n\nAnother moment of silence around the table- perhaps a silence for Matthäus's chances of making friends here. "Well, uh, that's interesting." said one.\n\n"Did you kill anyone?" said another, entirely too excited for the question he had asked."\n\n"What war?" said a third. Matthäus did not answer any of these questions. Instead, he picked up his bag and quickly walked out of the cafeteria. They didn't understand. Nobody here did, and nobody here ever would. He was alone, and perhaps he always would be."

 speer_moskowien.14.d:0 "Great minds were gathered with Speer. Politicians and military officers pored over great maps of old and new. The Fuhrer listened to what those around him now were discussing. Their ideas mixed together. That formed a great concoction of intellect that made little sense as emotions were injected into it followed by urgency.\n\nBut Speer knew that he had to keep his head above the murky waters of the war room. Here, in Germania, he had to make great efforts to prevail against both the military and the Slavs to the East.\n\nHere, Speer reminded himself, he had to keep eyes and ears everywhere. And right now, he had to take a breath and dive under the surface.\n\nThere he was with the sharks. And they were Speidel, Schörner, and Tresckow.\n\nSpeer estimated that Speidel would want something slow, something careful. Tresckow wanted a balanced approach. And Schörner, for the animal that he was, with war always his aim, wanted something hard...something fast, and that, Speer told himself, was dangerously similar to the old way of war.\n\nNow their squabbling was coming to an end as they turned to Speer, who had looked up at them. Speer cleared his throat and began to speak.\n\n"

 speer_moskowien.15.d:0 ""I must suggest that we take this carefully," Speidel said. He gestured to the map, explaining his plan, "It would make us seem reasonable, careful. It would allow us to behave better. We would take on the appearance of peacekeepers. We would not show too much force but instead we would show our intentions to give support to our own people in the East."\n\nSchörner shook his head at his words and told him to his face, "You are asking too much of our boys. You don't know what it's going to be like for them to face the Slavs. Those people would shoot our boys even if they behaved nicely and spoke to them politely. Neither they nor we are friendly neighbors now, are we?"\n\nBut Tresckow shot at him with words. "You're right, but this can save civilian lives." Schörner groaned at that and scoffed. Tresckow ignored him, adding to Speidel's points, "It can keep us from playing too much of a part in bringing the blood of innocent people on our troops. And it would show to the world that we are being intelligent about it."\n\n"What's intelligent is getting our men into the fire and out of there quickly rather than asking them to stay in the fire and do nothing," Schörner said, his face clearly showing that he wasn't having it from either of them.\n\n"It isn't going to be like that," Speidel told him, "because this will show the natives that we are not here to kill them all. They might even cooperate with us."\n\n"Hah! Good luck with that. No Slav would embrace us."\n\n"They won't, but it's worth trying. I'd rather keep civilian casualties low and our troops safe with careful officers rather than go headlong into a war that will spill the blood of everyone involved, either civilian or not," Tresckow added.\n\n"And this is only a plan. It's all up to our Fuhrer to decide what must be done." Speidel and his fellow officers now turned to Speer. The Fuhrer had listened to them."

 speer_moskowien.20.d:0 "The German army crawls closer to the enemy's lands, drawing itself deeper into the territories of the natives. Slowly.\n\nIt gnawed on the minds of both the enlisted men and their officers. The fear of being shot at by patient snipers or angry villagers settled on their shoulders the more they marched and halted and marched out again. But when no shot rang out, when no man shouted for cover or a medic, it seemed to them that the plan was working.\n\nStill, the Germans were cautious. And when they encountered civilians, reluctant men would remove themselves from the company of their comrades and their vehicles, carrying some rations or some kind of supplies to them. Most of the time, the meetings were brief, awkward, and all too nerve wracking on everyone. But at least those ended well. The rest of the encounters were either quite wholesome or quite bothersome.\n\nThe more they moved into the heart of the native territories, the more resistance and reluctance they found. Civilians either refused to welcome them, take their supplies, or reconsider shooting them. Snipers took advantage of kind German soldiers. And officers found themselves commanding squads of men yelling for permission to shoot back.\n\nAnd understandably, the officers were not enjoying this kind of control over what they had to do on the field. To have to put up with irritating villagers as well as hostile enemy elements was adding to their dissatisfaction.\n\n"

What is going on?"\n\nSpeidel, who seemed as shocked by such insubordination, said, his hands also shifting papers on his part of the table from place to place, "They're all asking to be court-martialed! They can't just refuse to obey orders like this! This places the entire plan in the mercy of the enemy."\n\nTresckow added, closing the folder containing his copies of what was sent to them from the East, "They should face justice. It's unbecoming of our officers to disobey the instructions of our Fatherland. But I am not sure we should be punishing them in such a great scale. What would they say about us if we put them all down?"\n\nSpeidel turned to him, "Do you suggest relaxing our instructions?"\n\n"No. I do not. But to sentence them all..." Tresckow shook his head and sighed. "Look, I do not think that it is going to make things easier for our men and the other officers following our instructions if we do away with these men. But it could most likely be the only thing we can do."\n\n"It's not surprising. I would agree with them, honestly," Schörner quipped, drawing the irritated glances of the two other officers, "I really think it's better for us all to be lenient. No use in wasting our officers."\n\nThe Fuhrer sighed. He got up, and so did the officers."

When they arrived, they were to await their executions.\n\nFor days, they seemed to protest their fates. Others accepted them quietly. The rest just couldn't believe it. Their own Fatherland was doing this to them, all because they saw the ridiculousness of having to follow orders that kept them from doing their duties.\n\nNevertheless, no matter how much they wanted not to face the sentences put on them, several of them were taken out in Berlin to be hanged in public. And there would be no way to refuse a hanging.\n\nBy groups, they were noosed. By groups, they were given chances to speak their last words. By groups, they were told of their crimes again. And by groups, they were dropped, their faces concealed by black hoods, their bodies suspended by the necks. Much to the cheers of the student movement which opposed them as well as to the grief of their families and fellow officers.\n\nThey were not to be buried as heroes. But instead, they would be buried as mere men who didn't want to obey their Fatherland, even if it meant being careful for the sake of saving its reputation.\n\n"

And they did so to do what they could not have done when those orders, those restrictions, were all in place.\n\nAnd all over the East, blood was spilled. Not only of the enemy, but also of their families and neighbors. And soon enough, reports streamed out from the East and into the West and out into the world.\n\nBut this was a good price to pay in order to get the war going again. To get it done. It was better than constantly moving then halting then moving again. It was better than waiting for orders all the way from the Fatherland. It was better than nothing, right? Right?\n\n"

That was better than any of the other alternatives. It prolonged the war, but it was better than staining the name of the Fatherland with the crimes and the bloodshed of past conflicts. It had to be. It all had to be.\n\nAnd the Fuhrer could count on it. With thanks to Speidel and to Tresckow, even as Schörner never really let that go, he could have faith in a future where Germany would be praised for its restraint and not for its barbarity. He could at least see a light at the end of the dark tunnel which it passed for choosing to intervene out there, out in the bloody East.\n\nBut with refreshing results came depressing implications. From the lieutenant up to the highest ranking officers of Germany's armed forces, especially the Heer, there was going to be hell to pay. And that was kept to their breasts privately, beneath their coats and their helmets, they all held their Fuhrer and his lackeys responsible for holding them back, for making them do nothing when they should have been free to do something.\n\n"

I do not believe that we should be too careful nor too careless."\n\nSpeer was interested, as he turned his head on his Security Minister. He looked at him steadily, thinking. "Well," he said, "what's your plan then?"\n\nSpeidel and Schörner both looked towards Tresckow; the former with hopeful eyes, the latter with fiery ones. Tresckow ignored them both and told Speer to his face, "We move at a moderate pace. We do not slow down if we don't have to and we do not force our men to move faster if the situation does not call for it. We are supposed to enter the Eastern territories with a flexible attitude and outlook."\n\nIt made sense. Speer saw that this compromise from Tresckow could save more lives than either Schörner's or Speidel's proposals. But he knew that Tresckow's was an option that would still lead to a significant number of losses. But this should serve as the one that would bleed Germany and the East less.\n\n"I see.

They cradled their weapons and set their eyes forward or around the convoy, suspicious of the quiet Russian trees and shrubs that lined their path. They were deep in the forests now, but they heard little from the birds and the other kinds of animals that were living in them. What was going on?\n\n"Halt!" Many of the men who heard the order turned their heads. Right before their convoy, a burning carcass of a tank. The route was blocked. Then came sharp passing sounds from the left and right. Some men fell from their transports. Others dove behind large rocks or piles of dirt. A loud but brief explosion came from the back of the convoy. Then another.\n\n"Ambush! Ambush! Everyone dismount!" Officers and their noncoms hurried to get their men in order. Drivers stayed in their vehicles or abandoned them, forgetting their weapons or bringing them out. Riflemen and machine-gunners attempted to bring their sights against the enemy that was hitting them from everywhere. But they saw no Russian, only flashes of guns.\n\nScreams and shouts. Smoke from the burning vehicles. More explosions. Commands from noncoms pushing their men at the enemy. Officers on the radios.\n\nThe Germans got their minds back. They fought the Russians back. And they pushed them away from the convoy. But when they returned, they counted their losses. A dozen of their tanks and another dozen of their vehicles were lost. So many men lay on the ground or on their vehicles. This convoy had survived, but with these results, it could not go further into the East.\n\n"

It was almost peaceful, he thought, if only he had not gotten his country into a war out in the East. Again.\n\nHe looked down at the officers and their staffs making their way quickly into the building. The Fuhrer slipped back to his seat and waited for them to come in.\n\nWhen they did, the Fuhrer almost regretted it, because he heard Schörner blowing steam at the two others who followed after him.\n\n"I told you that your pretty compromise would not work! Look at what you've gotten the men into! An ambush!"\n\nTresckow, almost red faced, his expression set in Prussian stone, brought himself to his seat without speaking to him yet. Once there, he said, "This is not mine alone to bear. It was not my only responsibility to take care of the intervention. You both are officers of our country, are you not? Why didn't you get your hand into it yourself, Schörner?"\n\nSpeidel sat by Tresckow but too was not in a good mood about it. "Does it matter now, Tresckow? Look at the situation - we have hundreds of men dead. And we have lost valuable vehicles. Why were we not trying to be careful?"\n\n"If we moved too carefully, then we would have lost more men because we would be too slow!"\n\n"Gentlemen, enough." Speer stood up, getting the three to rise up from their seats too. "I know all of you are not in good spirits because of what happened, but if we let this stay over our heads, then there is no solving it." He now sat down, letting the others do so too. He looked at them all then said, "For now, listen. I know that you all have given the appropriate instructions for your people to take care of the survivors. I know that this probably deserves retaliation. But we also know that we have families now without their loved ones."\n\nThe officers nodded. They understood. And Speer now gave his order...\n\n"

They waved farewell to the family that welcomed them, seeing their faces, some of them still with red eyes and tears going down their cheeks, handkerchiefs wiping them away, for the last time. For now.\n\nSpeer sighed as he looked away, Tresckow glanced at the Fuhrer, seeing him with a frown so deep that he almost felt like comforting the man. But he was the Fuhrer, and as an officer under him, he thought it disrespectful to try to do too much for him.\n\nThe Fuhrer himself felt his own heart come under another weight. He had visited so many families all over Germania. Later, he would have to see to the other families in the rest of the Reich. He wondered how many times he could say those words. "I'm so sorry for your loss..."\n"I regret telling you that your son has fallen in..."\n"My deepest condolences go to you and your family."\n"My sympathies are with you..."\n\nSpeer shook his head at himself, ignoring Tresckow's curious glance. The car had stopped. Tresckow reminded him as the Fuhrer stepped out, "This is the Kraus family. The soldier...he had-"\n\n"A pregnant wife and two daughters. I know." He turned to one of his escorts, who had left the car before he did, "Do we have the..." The escort nodded, looking up at the windows of the house. The Fuhrer followed as did Tresckow.\n\nFrom there, the silent eyes of the woman observed them. She seemed to tremble as she looked down at them.\n\nSpeer held his eyes up then sighed, reached for his hat, and took it off his head. Then he lowered his gaze and walked to the door and knocked gently. He waited for the woman to come down and open the door. When he saw her face, Speer thought he had seen the face of his own wife, in the same manner this woman showed her inevitable grief.\n\n"

The smaller ones scattered more easily over the city, obliterating those that were not on fire or else driving more of the flames into the rest of the area.\n\n"This is insane," Tresckow spoke, drawing Speer's eyes from the monitor. The Prussian was shaking his head, his eyes filled with dread and regret.\n\n"We have to do this," The Fuhrer said with resignation. His eyes returned to the monitor, ignoring Tresckow's following words.\n\n"As if we do not have any other choice! This isn't how we are supposed to respond to the enemy's forces! We're just killing civilians!"\n\n"What does it matter? Civilians are helping the enemy fight us off and kill our men. They deserve it, Tresckow," Schörner stated. Speidel said nothing, merely shaking his head.\n\n"It's still unnecessary! And it stains our honor as soldiers of Germany! This isn't the kind of war we should fight."\n\n"It is now," The Fuhrer said, "because this is the best way we can show force against the Slavs for what they've done."\n\nSchörner smiled. But Tresckow refused to let it go.\n\n"I will not stand for this. This is just not the right way of war. I will not have it, my Fuhrer. You must not let this happen! You should have not listened to him!"'\n\nThough he glared at Schörner, the Fuhrer said nothing. Speidel turned to him and told him, "What is done is done.

"No matter how careful we are, this whole thing is coming to a halt."\n\n"If you only just listened to me and kept going, we would have won this whole thing," Schörner boasted.\n\nTresckow glared at him and said, "We could lose more men if we force them to go into the jaws of the Russian resistance. Do you want them to go in there like blind men?"\n\n"Well, our soldiers are not blind, are they?" Shorner shot back.\n\n"Enough," Speer told them, his eyes remaining on the map, studying the lines and the units arranged for them all to see.

"Schörner, I know I am interested in a swift end to the bloodshed, but if we do that..."\n\n"If we do that, we save more lives - German lives! We should not care too much about the casualties of those causing trouble for our Fatherland in the East. Away with them, the pests!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer as Speidel too scowled at the man. But Speer kept his attention only towards Schörner, hating him for what he suggested. He had a point, but what about our reputation? "What you suggest is as terrible as committing the same methods our men once used in the West Russian War and before! Are you not aware what you are risking with, Generalfeldmarschall?"\n\nThe determined army officer just shrugged at the Fuhrer and gestured towards the maps, especially to the units displayed. "I only suggest what works. It is better than delaying our men, delaying their support, and above all, delaying Germany's hand in saving our settlers. Is that not our purpose?"\n\nThe other two now turned to Speer, who still maintained a disgusted expression against Schörner.

And as they did, the people attempted to flee. They ran to the boats and when those were destroyed, they swam into the lake. Others ran out of the town, chased down by troops and vehicles, crushed by treads or by wheels, shot in the back if they were too slow or slipped into the ground.\n\nThe wounded who dared to crawl away or limp behind some rubble were bayoneted or finished off with pistols.

What you've done is a grave error on your part, not theirs."\n\nSpeidel now spoke up, to support Speer and Tresckow, "You also ignored statements by your own reconnaissance that no enemy resistance was found in the town. Evidence was laid down in front of you again and again but you did not respond. You ignored what they said. You set aside all the warnings!"\n\n"Would you rather I let that town come under Russian control? You don't know what's on the ground!" Schörner now pointed at Speidel, rudely so. "Why don't you try to see what happens when we don't make sure of what is there in the town or not?"\n\n"So you admit you destroyed it?" Speer asked sharply, a revolted smile on his face. "Well? You've done it. You've killed men, women, and children that had nothing to do with our enemy!"\n\n"I did what I had to do. I don't care what you all say! This is necessary.

 speer_moskowien.35.d:0 "The poorly built train provided no comfort for the Oberleutenant, as while the train whipping back and forth was usually no issue for supply shipments, personnel had been a different story. Not to mention the freezing temperatures that had plagued every one of the advisors as they prepared to reach Reichskommissariat Moskowien. But, as the Oberleutenant knew, comfort wasn't the priority of the Reich, was it? The train coming to a screeching halt painted a picture of his platoon's desperate stand at Bremen while he fought for Speer's succession. Exiting the train, he took one last look at his pocketwatch containing a picture of his wife before stepping off.\n\nThe rumbling of the train made it hard to hear anything else, but for the Oberleutenant, the marching of boots managed to triumph the surrounding area, as more and more soldiers within Moskau prepared themselves through the bustling streets, as if the whole city was on the move. "Oberleutenant Vogt?" called a distant voice, grasping the Oberleutenant's attention as he came to see a young Leutenant saluting him. "At ease, Leutenant. You're here to bring me to my station, correct?" Vogt said. "Aye, sir, please, follow me, sir." prompting the young officer to face about and begin walking alongside Vogt. Everywhere Vogt looked, he only realized that the chaotic mess was growing, as dirtied Aryan settlers hurried to earn a few extra Reichsmarks whilst platoons of the Reichskommissariat's soldiers marched past. "Poor bastards never had it this hard, did they?" Vogt asked. "Not exactly, sir, preparations for a possible assault by the Russians has shaken up the lives of everyone in the settlement, though everyone is hopeful for the advisors that have come in." The prevalence of such "hope" did not appear evident for Vogt as he saw scared German children and fathers having to say one last goodbye before hurrying off with a rifle in tow.\n\nEventually, Vogt managed to escape the chaos-ridden frost as he entered his small office room within one of the military installations of Moskowien. To say that the ones present during the civil war in Germany were better was an overstatement, with staff tripping over themselves, rats scurrying down the hallways, and barely enough room to stand in. "Sir, command has issued that advisors are to aid in the training of divisions newly formed in the wake of the possible attack from the natives. Heil Speer." the Leutenant said, offering a salute in the air."

Breathe out. Fire. Reload, rinse, and repeat. Fix bayonets if the enemy got any closer. Had it not been that easy to operate the weapons left from the Second World War to prepare the Reichskommissariat for such an attack like this? Apparently fucking not, according to Vogt, given how this morning has gone so far. Fighting and killing fellow Germans felt easier than dealing with this catastrophe.\n\nIt was four in the morning when the battalion he had been assigned to start off with were finished lining up, with some of the men obviously not knowing what standing at attention meant. Lighting his cigarette, Vogt yelled out, "Men, my name is Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt. As I have seen blood spilt within our homeland through war, so too now do the Russians seek to spill our blood to retain their damned power, looking to unite against our families, our Fatherland! And as proud Germans seeking to do their homeland proud, we cannot allow this. Today begins your training for when you face the frontlines, in the reality of which some of you will die. However, that is not the concern now. Today, you shall become true workers of the Reichskommissariat, true soldiers, and true Germans. Now, first platoon of the first company, mount the firing range."\n\nVogt's inspiring words seemingly died in his eyes as the men lined up for weapon training. Some of these men hadn't touched a rifle in years, while others hadn't done so at all, and only worked the farms while producing large families, as the Reich had given permission to do so. None had known the true brutalities that were to come, as Vogt had seen during the civil war, especially when some of them barely figured out how to slide the bolt open. However, the worst came when the men had finally regularly begun firing at the targets when a shower of blood splattered across the field, some staining Vogt's coat, with screaming following. Men rushed over, and saw one that one of the recruits shot themselves in the hand, nearly blowing it off; however, despite the horrificness of the situation, the man managed to retain as much composure as he could, even firing off a joke or two in the process.\n\nVogt knew the truth of the situation: the man shot himself in order to get out of service, in order to escape the horrors that everyone else was bound to endure. Yet, the Oberleutenant knew the truth of it all, that he couldn't shatter the mens' spirits knowing they had cowards in their ranks, and chose to send him away to deal with later. Afterwards, the men along the firing line simply stared at Vogt."

 speer_moskowien.37.d:0 "The Eagle, a bird of prey that overlooked the lands of the Germans for centuries. In times past, it represented the strength of the empires long past within German history, having served as a symbol of perseverance and courage. Now, as Vogt knew all too well, the symbol flew as to represent the Fatherland, along with the battalion of conscripts and volunteers within the newly formed "Adlersgruppe," charged with protecting their friends and families from the Russian onslaught that inevitably stormed its way forward. As the men continued setting up defenses in some backwater village to the south of Moskau, they continuously talked about potentially being called heroes on their return home. The word "hero" brought a whiplash of pessimism for Oberleutenant Vogt, nearly distracting him before the sounds of one of the infantrymen being torn apart by submachine gun fire exploded out.\n\nA period of shock-ridden silence boomed, until screams in Russian came from across the town, and the Germans hurried to their assigned positions, with Vogt's orders starting to become drowned out by the incoming gunfire. Chunks of concrete came flying off of surrounding buildings, some even tearing apart the faces of the new recruits, as they continually battled in the streets, with bullets flying and the blood of both Germans and Russians showering the air in a flurry of fire and gore. Vogt had known the terror of guerilla warfare for years, and now, as a Russian truck with a light-machine gun in the bed firing down into the Germans, Vogt had the chance to utilize his experience. With cries drowning the air, Vogt shouted at some of the closest men to him, "Find your strength men, now's our time to make the advance! Unteroffizier Breiner, take some men and gather the explosives! Unteroffizier Kranz, gather some men with me and we'll surround the truck, it cannot-" a bullet interrupted Vogt's speech as a rain of gunfire forced him to find better cover. As he regained his defense, the only thing the Oberleutenant saw when he laid his eyes on his men were the same emotions portrayed by his brothers-in-arms during their time fighting for Speer back in Germany. The same emotion that came as the feelings of heroism faded, and the chilling shadow of death crept closer and closer, with every comrade lost to another bullet, whether it's fired from a Russian or a German.\n\nTerror.\n\nWiping his face some more, Oberleutenant Vogt shouted "Fall back, fall back! We'll find another way around!" as the German soldiers began to retreat in the face of the overwhelming firepower from the Russians. They may not be heroes, but they didn't need to be heroes to deserve to live another day, to Vogt, anyway."

The death, the destruction, the disease, and all the other terrors. But Vogt could never have expected the brutalities to rise so quickly: the amount of mass executions, the killings of deserters, those once considered to be comrades in fighting against the Russians, the viscera, all had come crashing down upon the volunteers in such a short period. Much to the respect of Oberleutenant Vogt, while it all seemed difficult, the men continued to march forward past it all; that is, until the Burning of Ryazan.\n\nAs the Adlergruppe marched southwards from Moskau, pushing deeper into Russian territory "in the defense of the Reich's' rightful territory,'' the men had already become surrounded as the urban battle exploded. Sure, the men got their first taste of battle in a village, but this was an entirely different story as the concrete buildings and structures hid enemy Russians behind every corner. Constantly, squads of enemy soldiers seemed to appear as phantoms in the dark, pinning a few squads of the Germans down before they finally dealt with the issue. This was, until Alpha Company, led by Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt, entered the courtyard of an apartment complex to secure the area, and became pinned down by heavy enemy fire from all sides of the three-sided building. The men rushed to cover or died trying to do so, with the screams of fellow Aryans dying in the stony courtyard filling the air, as what seemed like the endless Russian supply of lead came raining hell upon the company. Vogt was left with no other choice but to hold out as he continuously pleaded for air support from local German air wings, who promised "immediate combat support."\n\nIt took a seemingly endless five minutes for the screams of the German jets to overtake the slaughter, as the Gates of Hell seemed to open up from the heavens above and consume the apartment complex. The men watched along in horror, some trying to get up and move as the fiery napalm they pleaded for arrived, sticking to the enemy soldiers who threw themselves off the multiple story balconies to escape the horrid fate of burning to death. However, as Vogt thought the horror was over, it only multiplied in size, as the outer doors of the apartment complex opened up and a flood of burning men, women, and children came screeching out of the complex. Only some had been armed, but none cared any longer, as they peeled away at the flesh and bone that melted away from the deadly German napalm, with mothers holding their children, hoping for an end to the madness. Eventually, all had either died from the flames or were killed out of mercy by some of those within the Aldersgruppe, who had all seemed to shock and terrified to be able to respond to any other orders from some of the superiors.\n\nThe nightmares that night consumed Vogt's mind. Flashbacks to that last stand at Bremen stormed his mind only to reach a burning conclusion, with the flooding of anachronistic burning children and women into the once-heroic battlefield, causing the Oberleutenant to rocket from his dreams every hour of the night."

Finally, the glowing numbers of "418" came into view with a screeching halt, and she excitedly danced over, finally seeing her beloved Marzell come into view. She immediately rushed to embrace her Marzell, who jumped at the sight of his rushing wife, causing her confusion, saying, "You're finally back, Marzell! Come here!" she said, embracing her husband. "Yes, I'm, I'm home now." Marzell said, as Marina felt her husband's hand shake.\n\nHours had gone by, and yet, the newly returning husband still remained...odd, according to Marina. Everytime a new question came forward, like, "How did it feel to serve the Fatherland once more?" he simply responded with a quick "It was good." or "Great." She couldn't name the look in his eyes, one of distance, as if his eyes were a camera out of focus, but she simply tried to provide everything she could to be a good wife. That evening, as the couple climbed into bed, Marina's attempts to embrace and comfort her husband resulted in a simple repulse on the side of her husband, followed by his attempts to get some sleep as he tossed and turned in the bed.\n\nLater into the night, Marina woke to the sound of broken glass and an otherwise empty bed, as she threw off the covers and rushed towards the kitchen, where she heard the loud noise. Realizing her husband was nowhere in sight, she grabbed a letter opener they kept on the desk before entering the kitchen...where she found her husband, with glass shards shattered across the table and ground, whiskey, which her husband swore to never drink in his career, spilled across the area, and a bloodied hand carrying a pistol kept from service. Marina dropped the letter opener on the ground as she approached her husband, asking "Marzell, oh god, what's wrong?" Marzell responded with nothing, only beginning to sob into her chest as he dropped the pistol on the ground, and embraced her tightly, shaking all the while."

And within one small compartment, the bustling and rocking of the powerful locomotive hardly shook the work Walther Viktorow had prepared. Viktorow sat excitedly, tapping on his briefcase filled with documents and procedural forms as he stared out into the Western Russian wilderness, completely losing track of the outside world as the train came to a screech, and the city streets filled his view. Finally, after so much wrongdoing against the harrowed Russian, Viktorow knew that the time had come to make a difference in the world, even if the greatest trial awaited him, and he had one thought which dominated his mind:\n\nMoskau awaits.\n\nHowever, as Viktorow exited the train, accompanied by a group of German guardsmen straight from Germania, the full force of the trial would strike as he looked around the train station. Everywhere, men, women, and children, all with bright, beautiful blue eyes, and adorned with flowing golden hair, all looked as if they had come from a German slum. Exhaustion colored their faces while callouses covered their hands, with some appearing frail and hungry, and all adorning ragged clothes that would bring disgust to most German higher ups. But Viktorow did not want the prestige or class of higher up, this is exactly what Viktorow wanted, even if he could not stand the pleading eyes of the settlers here. At the end of the day, they were the Reich's citizens, and as proud as they may be, they were suffering, and Viktorow knew that he, as an ambassador on behalf of the Reich itself, he could not allow this any longer.\n\nAs the snow landed atop his cap, the toy of a young child bounced across the street in front of the capitol, nearly prompting a guard to strike the child, were it not for Viktorow's intervention. Handing the child his toy from next to Viktorow's feet, the diplomat said a few simple words to the boy: "Do not be afraid, things will change here soon." as he looked onwards to the capitol building of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, as the recent clashings of Germans and Russians flooded his mind."

Improvements regarding the stability of the transportation systems between the Reich and the Reichskommissariat could potentially be looked into; however, if anything, the difficulty presented in the transportation systems is a small look into the situation within Moskowien. Politically, the situation within the area appears stable enough to not withdraw supply efforts towards the settlers of the area, nor do any reports indicate a collapse for the Reich's influence within the area around Moskau; however, living standards have fallen dramatically for the Aryan settlers within the Reichskommissariat as well as native Russians. Outbreaks of conflict between native Russian populaces and the settlers arriving from Germany proper has caused considerable detriment for German settlements, and Russians within the area have suffered as well, despite the advancements made within the area. In this regard, although living conditions have plummeted for all parties within Moscowien and the surrounding Russian nation-state, the populace has espoused supreme loyalty towards the Reich itself, and in an effort to support the German and the Russian within the area, the developing situation has been taken with the greatest priority for our diplomatic envoy. Thus, actions towards the advancement of OPERATION: GREATWHITE will begin immediate implementation within the interactions between Reichskommissar Kasche's successor, native leadership within the newly established state for Russians outside of Reichskommissar Moscowien, and the diplomatic envoy you have assigned me to, and transportation to the capital of the nation-state of the Russians will be arranged to aid our mutual efforts through a hopeful admittance into the Unity-Pakt.

Viktorow knew that as the days went on, the time before he'd venture forward to meet with the officials of the Russian nation grew shorter and shorter; yet, despite his excitement for the eventual departure and work, everything left him confounded in the reasoning behind the excitement.\n\n"Excuse me, Dr. Viktorow, but the convoy has been prepared for transportation." a young secretary said as he had missed her knocks on the door. "My apologies, Miss Berchow, right away." the diplomat said, as he grabbed his suitcase and followed her out. Everything around him had showcased what he enjoyed, the order, the structure of it all, and now was finally his time to make a difference. Time to make a difference that his predecessors of the past did not, he continued, thinking of the pictures of his family he kept so neatly tucked away back home in Germania. The carvings of the beautiful little box delighted Viktorow, in contrast with the contents, as he saw capturings of the times of a Russian family working its hardest to get through the wall set up by German forces. How great of suffering his grandparents had been as they crossed over into the new land of Germany, and the dreaded persecutions that the Viktorovs faced being foreign immigrants in a hostile land. But no more, no more crushed dreams nor broken souls from either side, as each and every hardworking German and Russian around Moskowien has earned their right to support from the Fatherland, and earned an end to the troubles which plagued them.\n\nViktorow continued his thoughts as he finally made it outside the capital alongside his fellow statesmen and the Waffen regiment accompanying them deep into the Russian land. The frost encapsulating the trucks reminded VIktorow of his grandfather and grandmother as the convoy began to move away from Moskowien territory."

As the entourage continued onwards, the silence slowly transformed from an excited admiration of the Russian land to a dreaded silence, with each rotation of the tires bringing another wave of confusing tensions as the Waffen guards present in Viktorow's truck prepped themselves. It was confusing to Viktorow, to say the least, until the trucks finally passed through the iron gates of the city.\n\nThere, peering through the windows of a heavily armored truck, Viktorow, for the first time in his life, received a glimpse as to what his grandmother and grandfather escaped all those years ago: the glimpses of children roaming the streets without parents in sight, in rags, fighting over a piece of bread which had been stained by the mud of the ground. Across the street, Viktorow caught glimpses of three men beating another fellow Russian on the ground, pummeling him with bats, punches, and kicks as they strip him of his bag and coat and duck off into the alleyway, passing by a duo of nurses carrying a body covered with a tarp out of a health center. The homeless had grown in number as he saw groups of armed men harassing a young woman coming out of her home, seemingly asking for overdue money owed to them, and Viktorow could only pray for her safety as the convoy moved on. Viktorow continued to think and debate with himself as to what had become the fate of the Russian people, what could have done this? Were the politicians in charge of the state that greedy, or was there some sort of crisis causing all of this? Viktorow continued to pray for the hope that things had not been completely this way for his ancestors.\n\nAs the motorcade came to a halt outside of the capitol building, Viktorow continued to dust himself off and grab his briefcase as his eyes locked onto a peculiar sight: a little girl, no older than seven, grabbed at the chain link fence as she continued to stare at the Germans inside. She looked thinly, and had only dirty rags on, yet her brown eyes glimmered in the snow, reminding Viktorow of the daughter he always wanted.

The desperateness and near predatory nature of some of the groups that had formed outside of the Moskowien territory, how could the self-governed area fall apart so quickly, yet the room he sits in remain so lavish?\n\nSuddenly, the wrinkled face of the anti-Soviet himself, Bronisalv Kaminski entered the room, offering a nod and handshake to the diplomat. "Brigadeführer Kaminski, it is an honor to meet you, my name is Dr. Walther Viktorow-" Viktorow said, before being cut off by Kaminski, who stated, "Ah, the diplomat sent by Speer, huh? We've been waiting for the day of your arrival, what's the terms?" Viktorow hadn't pictured such exhaustion from Kaminski, but then again, all of the area has been a surprise, hasn't it? Taken aback, Viktorow took out the first report in the file, and began discussing the Führer's desires out of Kaminski to pay for the incredible amount of support issued to the native state via the ceding of Brauchitschstadt and a swearing of loyalty to the Unity-Pakt. Viktorow's seemingly hopeful words brought him to look up, only to meet the image of Kaminski hunched over the desk, both hands clasping his face, with only whispers to be heard between Viktorow's relaying message: "They'll march in and hang me...joining the Unity-Pakt....the natives, they've given..." And finally, as if a sledgehammer broke through a castle made of sand, everything came together for Viktorow. The terms, the ceding of territory, the governmental lavishness, yet the hopeless and the butchers remaining outside, this wasn't Kaminski's misdoings, they've been paying everything towards the Reich for all the aid they received at first. They couldn't stand on their own, they needed help, and now...wait, Operation: Great White. Viktorow wasn't serving as a negotiator here, he was a predator: a loan shark.\n\nIn the end, Kaminski, with eyes that seemingly had the life sucked out of them, shook to the agreement of losing Brauchitschstadt and joining the Pakt. With every step, from leaving the capital building, to walking to the trucks, to staring out the windows as they rumbled out, Walther Viktorow felt one thing alone: the eyes of starving, broken Russians."

Meeting with BRONISALV KAMINSKI retained success within the notions outlined in OPERATION: GREATWHITE, as the native state has agreed to cede Brauchitschstadt to the direct control of the German Reich while issuing a submittance of willingness to joining the Unity-Pakt in support of Germany proper in exchange for the cancellation of debts owed from the local government towards Germania. German settlers retained celebratory feelings over the success and technical end to conflicts against their Russian neighbors, as local reports showed demonstrations of praise regarding the Reichskommissariat's government. Outside of Moskau, reports of Russian citizens' outrage over the terms of KAMINSKI'S agreement have been issued to local media outlets, with even some factions within Brauchitschstadt reporting direct obstinance towards the notions of direct annexation by the German Reich proper. Overall tension within the area remains to be seen, as continuous data has been feeding into the Reichskommissariat's office to measure the success of the terms. Within personal reason and experience, it is within bounds of my personal measures to report that OPERATION: GREATWHITE provides immediate successes for the German Reich; however, continuous documentation will be required to measure long-term successes. Insofar as measurements reach, the continuous losses of the native populaces following the Second World War, the Western Russian War, and now the loss of Brauchitschstadt and the diplomatic alignment with the Unity-Pakt may offer a fostering point for native resistances.

Peaceful for now, but surrounded by disorder on all sides.\n\n"Come in, come in."\n\n"Foreign minister, a report from Moskowien. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating reading."\n\n"Thank you. You're one of Gehlen's boys, with the RND?"\n\nThe young man opposite him remained silent, and smiled coldly. Schmidt internally rolled his eyes and took the paper from him. "Very well. Off you go then."\n\nWith a short bow, the man left. Schmidt stared at the paper in front of him. 'Kaminski victorious', a newspaper clipping on the front read. Ah, so old Brinislaw had won out against the German settlers. A bad situation for Germany, perhaps, what with the whole legacy of a totalitarian Reichkomissariat and all leaving a sour taste in Russian mouths. Still, Schmidt thought it was perhaps preferable to Von Dem Bach or one of the other wretched Nazis patrolling the ruins of Russia. If not for his government, then for humanity as a whole.\n\nHe filed through the papers, and one stood out particularly. An intercepted telegram, between one of Brinislaw's men and some sympathetic Russian national in Lettland. Now this was interesting. Seems Kaminski had become convinced the best way for his Moscow autonomy out of the chaos enveloping the rest of Russia was a negotiation session with Germania's finest.

Russian troops lined the streets, eying down the foreign minister's convoy as it moved toward the central bar, which had seemingly been refitted into a political centre of operations for Kaminski's forces in this region. Schmidt was confident that he was safe; the Heer around him was equipped with better weapons than these peasant conscripts, that was for sure. Either way, blood spilled today would not be the preferable option.\n\nNegotiations were over lunch. Shashlik, Pelmeni and even Chicken Kiev. Schmidt didn't have Russian cuisine often, but it remained one of his favourites on the continent. Beyond the food, Schmidt was impressed with Kaminski. The man spoke German well, and seemed cultured in literature and philosophy, something that even in the supposed 'world capital' politicians often lacked. The man's taste was clearly in the sciences, however, but Schmidt was capable of holding basic conversation on the scientific feats of Tesla through to Braun. Schmidt liked Kaminski, and it seemed the favour was mutual.\n\nA minor tremor in the conversation was felt. Schmidt let it be known that Brauchitschstadt, or what the Russians still call 'Leningrad', would be directly administered by Germania. The city seemed to hold sentimental value to the old soldier opposite him, who had served his time with the Red Army before Stalin's purges. Lenin was still an admired figure.\n\nDespite this, Kaminski was still willing for the negotiations to move forward.

"Perhaps the Heer might take an advisory role in the new Moscow government, if you would be so willing."\n\n"I heard what you said the first time, I was just checking to see if you were the rat you appeared to be." Kaminski sighed. "You know, Schmidt, out here in the East, people call you a hero. There's optimism that you might be something different to those Nazi scum who run your country. That you might be an angel on Speer's shoulder, and you might do something genuinely good for Russia, or even the world."\n\nSchmidt watched as the man opposite him stood from his unfinished lunch. Kaminski faced away, equipping his coat as he continued. "No man is immune to propaganda. I read an American minister talk about it, and you know Schmidt, I hate the Americans, but this one had a point. 'Propaganda makes puppets of us'. It has made a puppet out of you. My blood might come from Warsaw, Minsk, and the very soil this building stands on, but do you think just because I am a Slav that I am stupid?"\n\n"Take yourself and those uptight pricks in uniform behind you back to whatever fucking hell you came from." Kaminski's glare penetrated Schmidt, and the Russians left the room. Schmidt slammed the table once the door had shut. War had come again."

Send my best wishes back to the RND with you."\n\nThe young man saluted, and exited the room. Speer was left with a folder of documents pertaining to the breakdown of the recent partition in Moskowien. Ah. Erich von dem Bach has claimed victory, or so the clipping at the front of the folder would have the Führer believe. Perhaps his Cyrillic was a bit rusty, but flicking through the rest of the documentation suggested that this was the accurate outcome.\n\n"Finally, some good news," Speer muttered to himself. A loyal Wehrmacht general sat in Moscow now, and the Führer could see no reason why resistance was even conceivable. He picked the phone up from his desk.\n\n"

As good a place as any for diplomatic arrangements. Perhaps more importantly, Erich von dem Bach hadn't seen his hometown for years, and so Schmidt thought it might be beneficial to arrange a meeting there. The bewildered old soldier was guided by the foreign minister into the party office building that had been reserved for the meeting. A table was decorated with a grand lunch for Moskowien's interim ruler. Wurst, potatoes and plenty of beer. "Schmidt, this was unnecessary. Thank you."\n\n"Anything for a fellow German on the homebound flight. Now, down to business?"\n\nAt Bach's nod, Schmidt began. With an apology, the foreign minister revealed that Bach's position would be filled by Alexis von Roenne, to which Bach was seemingly compliant. Additionally, the Reich would directly occupy Brauchistschstadt, and create a new german settler state in the Southern Volga region. To both of these territorial changes, Bach was quite amicable. "Happy to do my duty, sir."\n\nSchmidt smiled to himself. If he knew this was going to be so easy, he would've started drinking much earlier."

Schmidt thought he'd have hated Bach, but the man was honest and kind. They had been alone for some time, and Bach admitted his Kashubian heritage, which no one in the party, he was sure, knew. Sometimes, in Bach's weaker moments, even he doubted the party. Schmidt felt he had met a kindred spirit. The deal was sealed with signatures, and the men departed home.\n\nSchmidt didn't like night time flights, so he was staying in Lauenburg til the morning. He sat up in his hotel bed with the folder the RND had given him. It was a dossier on Bach, and although he had considered the diplomatic sections with great detail, he had only skimmed the personal section. Schmidt's eyebrows furrowed as he glanced over a section tabbed as 'Activities before Moskowien', detailing the man's actions before the war. Schmidt felt his heart race. The man he had joked and drunk with just hours earlier had been responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents, and these were only the documented ones. In Operation Hummingbird, Bach had personally killed several in the SA. Then there was his horrific career in the SS, which Schmidt had heard of but never actively considered.\n\nNo one in this Reich was innocent. Not even the kindest of faces, or the warmest of voices. It was just Schmidt, and Schmidt alone, dancing with the murderers that had destroyed his father's country. He felt his eyes begin to tear up, but suppressed the urge to cry. He had done too much of that recently. At least the deal had gone smoothly. Another nation returned to the Unity Pakt for his favourite murderer, the Führer."

The host complimented the scientists on their results, expressing his "great appreciation" for the progress made in the fields of electronics and industry, of engineering and military. "With your keen intellect and your selfless dedication to the Reich" he stated in a speech at the end of the banquet, "you not only ensure the Vaterland's greatness and the continuation of the dream of National Socialism, which should already be a satisfying reward for true patriots such as yourselves.

At one point, the Führer interrupted the barrage: "Minister, please stop! Are we truly in such a state? Has the Reich really fallen behind so much?"\n"Please come with me mein Führer"\nAs the two moved to the window, the Minister pointed at the cars: "Do you recognise them?" and that was enough answer. To his consternation, Speer saw that most, if not all cars and trucks passing were models ten - if not more - years old. Looking with more attention, he also noticed details he had missed when looking outside in the past weeks: patchwork reparations to the roads and sidewalks, electric cables hanging from scrambled-together power lines, public phones scattered because the people had no telephones inside their homes...\n\nRight at that moment, as if to confirm that indeed, the situation was dire, all lights went out in the office, and the surprised voices from outside the door made it clear that it was a general blackout. The Führer fumbled around to his desk, suddenly dejected, and sighed. "Please resume your report, Minister..."

By their expressions and the excited comments, one would think they resembled children waiting their turn to enter a bakery shop, and in a way, they indeed were.\n\nA large machine stood in the middle of the room, towering over the assembled people. At human level, a small screen and a keyboard were encased in the metal: the screen had nothing on it, but soon it would change. In a very similar room in Germania, the central hub of NetzRAM had been activated, and the network spanning the entirety of the Reich was officially active. In a few moments, a message would arrive from the main device, and the results of this first test would show whether the experiment had been a resounding success or a humiliating failure.\n\nThe screen buzzed with life, and everyone almost turned into a giraffe trying to look at the screen: letter after letter... it appeared! "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?" Cheers erupted across the room, and with trembling hand, the University dean answered: "WALTHER BOTHE". Another few seconds, then a second message: "WHAT IS YOUR QUEST?" to which the agreed-upon answer: "TO FURTHER SCIENCE". Finally, the third and last: "WHAT IS THE AIRSPEED VELOCITY OF AN UNLADEN SWALLOW?"\n\nSilence fell in the room. This wasn't the correct question! Was there a problem? A bug? A... hacker?! Then, a student asked for permission to write, and once he had it, he quickly wrote: "AN AFRICAN OR A EUROPEAN SWALLOW?"

The first, critically, is the Antifachistische Aktion. Being one of the most vocal opponents of National Socialism, they were purported as 'exterminated' under the leadership of Führer Adolf Hitler, but unfortunately we have been mistaken. We know little of them yet, so uncovering their degenerative Bolshevik roots is important.\n\nSecondly, is the exponential ramp-up of the student movement in Germany. We have firm reason to believe that, while they are backed by Antifa, they form the backbone of the reformist movement in Germany. With this, a double-pronged problem has been formed.

"Your mission will be as follows:\n\nAt [redacted] past midnight, you will infiltrate past the security in the house. You will be given significant amounts of explosives, and you will need to plant them across several weak points throughout the house.

Of course it was necessary. Anything else would not be tolerated, but now the state had to deal with the fall-out that followed. At the very least it wasn't as bad as he may have initially thought, but seeing every day pop up with another article about how some pushy college student affiliated with Antifa was arrested by the men in black.

It was plain in sight, clear as day, black as night!.\n\nBut when he showed up to protest at his college that afternoon, most of his colleagues weren't around with him.

One of the Antifa members decided to pull ahead of their group and begin shouting. "Klaus Becker!" He shouted, and one of the students raised their hand, moving forward. "We're told your father is a veteran pilot in the Luftwaffe, and that you vote for the NSDAP. Are both of these things true?"\n\nThe silence was unpleasant. It was broken, however, when Klaus let out a laugh. "Who told you THAT?! My Opa is a retired electrician, and I've never touched a ballot in my life! Goodness... if you don't believe me, I'll be happy to show you my father's certificate!" That chipped off some of Antifa's initial weariness, and as more students were asked, more of these nonsensical facts were debunked.

Starting shortly on the afternoon, the students gathered up at campus to rally against the Government's policies. As they were marching up and down the streets, waving around signs of degenerate counter-culture and generally making a mess of the place, another element appeared! The vicious Antifa, commonly known to aid these protests against the brave police force set to keep the peace and calm, came down like vultures on a corpse!\n\nTestimonies from the students say that they could hear these Antifa members shout various obscenities, as well as making claims that they were "in cahoots with the fascists", that "your parents are in Nazi pockets", and that "you don't care about true freedom". Clearly, neither did Antifa, as several students were left with severe bruising, with one even having to be rushed to the hospital! This is a shameful day for all Germans, and we can only hope that the people shall learn about the terrible truths that have plagued this incessant Antifa ever since their origins.For any Germans near and far, let it be known! Even if you attempt to go against the government, in the eyes of the Bolsheviks, you are nothing but a so-called "puppet"! Their measures are too extreme, too radicalized, too out-of-line with true German ideology, and so they will strike at any weakness!\n\n- The Arbeitertum, your first and most quality source for anything related to labor. - "

Ever since he heard the news about that incident with a chapter of Antifa, he grabbed at his nervousness and almost decided against going to the meeting today. Still, he had to meet with Elsa Fechner, the effective head of the student protesters in this university, or he'd do his own chapter a major disservice.\n\nStepping into the cool, open halls of the school, he spotted Elsa with a few other students, talking to each other before she turned her gaze to him. He moved to talk to her, and she merely waved her hand dismissively as she approached. "I don't want to deal with you anymore, Leon."\n\n"Elsa..." He trailed off, already feeling sweat forming on his head. "Don't do this. We're not affiliated with that chapter-" She gave him a stern glare, and the other two students backed off. "I know you're not. I don't care. I'm not risking the legitimacy of our movement by associating with you. Even if such an incident would never occur between us, what do you think the students here want?" Her eyes softened, and she looked away. "Just go." Hesitation creeped up her throat, but she threw it back down. "Tell your chapter we're no longer allied with each other. A lot of our students have turned against Antifa, and I can't convince them otherwise."\n\nPainful silence came from Leon, and he swallowed, opening his mouth to say something before he stopped whatever he wanted to say. "No... I... alright. That's fine. W-we'll be fine. I... hope you do well without us." She looked up towards Leon and gave him a demoralized, pained look."

Especially as you decided to focus on Antifa, rather than the students." Wessel quietly raised an eyebrow at the comment. What was it about the students that he was so dissuaded by? "Thankfully, no blood of our agents has been spilled, and Antifa's popularity has dropped like a rock. The problem, however..."\n\nHe readjusted himself in his seat and reached in for a map he pulled out from under his desk. It was a map of Germany and its cities, with several being marked with red circles. "These are suspected Antifa strongholds." He exclaimed, tapping on one of the major cities. "Now... the reason why I say suspected and not are is because, well..."\n\n"Their popular support dropping means that they must switch tactics." Wessel plainly said, and nodded, and Gehlen raised an eyebrow at him. "I am aware. It will make infiltration more difficult, though it will simultaneously be easier to justify getting rid of them."\n\nGiving a second of pause, Gehlen proceeded to give the lightest of smiles. "Good, good. You're already getting a grasp of the situation." Wessel wondered if he was the one who just got a handle on the situation, but perished the thought. "Then I believe I needn't tell you more." Showing a hand, Wessel returned it and both shook strongly. "Germany is always under our watchful gaze, Herr Wessel." Gehlen said. "Don't forget that.

The object of their trafficking, however, is forbidden literature: thousands of outlawed books from the United States and Canada have been smuggled into the Reich through Brittany. Most concern Marxism and socialism, while others debate the themes of slavery, civil rights and democracy.

However, in addressing the events of the rally for the Reichsparteitag der Macht at Nuremberg, we must recognize a certain degree of failure amidst ourselves and our department in the handling of what happened, and our preparations for a potential conflict.

Gehlen took a long drag of his cigar, looking at his desk, before uttering with a puff of smoke, "What makes you think anyone else is involved? Could be some fucked up kid after all." "It just doesn't make sense, he's a young kid, small criminal record, doing day jobs, why on Earth would he shoot a political ideologue?" Wessel responded. With a chuckle, Gehlen said, "Huh, well, if you ask me, some of those lowlifes can get all wrapped up in the SS's business, when there's nowhere to gun, men run to the occult. I'd start your search there." Wessel was taken aback, the Ordenstaat? Would they really bother shooting a student leader, just for disagreeing? While doubt rushed to his head about Gehlen's statement, he was interrupted by a young intelligence officer slamming open the door, with an urgent look in his eyes.\n\nJosef Bachmann was found hanged in his cell.

Wessel, a skilled and experienced investigator, knew that the answers lied within the body, within Bachmann. And yet, everytime he approached the idea, bureaucratic shifts of resources and reorganizations of priorities for the department swept up any attempts.\n\nThe ever-recurring wall of smoke hit Wessel like a wave, only to calm back down and reveal the face of his ever-diligent superior.

"Well, Herr Gehlen, I just have some, well, issues in the Nuremberg investigation, but I believe I have a solution. You see, I understand your hypothesis; however, it appears too convenient, or even that we may have overlooked pieces attached to Bachmann that could lead further in any direction. Nevertheless, I believe a formal reinvestigation of Bachmann's body could allow for some, well, advances. Unfortunately, the proposal has been shut down due to other matters of the office becoming, well, randomly prioritized, and I believe we need to focus the investigation." Gehlen said, squashing the cigar against the ashtray on his desk. "Bachmann had clear ties to Burgundian authorities, it's as clear as day upon the man's very clothes. You wish to tell me that it could somehow be something completely different? We have many things to worry about in the RND, reopening a closed case is not one of them, Wessel."

This wasn't right, not at all. Lifting his office phone, Wessel said, "Wedekind...Kessler...to my office, please."\n\nThus, a plan was hatched.

However, the most damning piece of information dawned in the mind of Gerhard Wessel: Heinz Felfe had been in Kyiv for a criminal autopsy.\n\n"Someone forged these documents." Wessel said, in shock. The two men nodded, Kessler burning through a cigarette in the meantime. "Someone is throwing off this entire investigation. Someone powerful." The questioned remained however: should he intend to pursue whoever is throwing everything off, or would it just lead to their deaths?"

 speer_rnd.49.t:0 "The Devil's in the Details"
 speer_rnd.49.d:0 "Gerhard Wessel spent his waking hours and nights of supposed sleep investigating Wedekind and Kessler's findings. What should have been time to see friends, loved ones, or co-workers, instead was spent looking at photos of a dead gunman, and a counterfeit autopsy supposedly performed by a man hundreds of miles away. And yet, the documents kept showing more and more proof for Wessel.\n\nAs he stared at the documents, rushes and waves of doubt filled Wessel's mind, as the typically astute, focused, and efficient man turned inwards to paranoia and fear. The man who fought so diligently beside him, as a father, Reinhard Gehlen, and yet his name was plastered all over the investigation, whilst his words covered falsified information and throw offs from the main investigation. Was it true Gehlen? No, it couldn't be, this man was loyal to the Reich, why would he throw things off for a genuinely efficient information bureau that had trusted him dearly? Wessel's minds wandered throughout the worries and doubts of the world, as his entire career up to this point became jeopardized with the notions working in the midst of treachery, while other times it proceeded to become laser-focused on the difficult matter in front of him, looking for any potential leads and openings into this dreadful case of treachery and dangers around every corner. Suddenly, the familiar smoky odor alerted Wessel as he put away the material into his desk and Reinhard Gehlen came in.\n\n"Good afternoon, Wessel. Here, you got some departmental mail regarding last month's procedures and some ways we're looking to improve, figure you may have some worthwhile input, after all." Gehlen said, flashing a smile at his subordinate before leaving. Wessel's tired, sunken eyes could hardly stand any more bureaucracy, when his hands ran along the curious material of the rubber stamp attached to the envelope. That's when an idea hatched in Wessel's mind, and he cleared through his desk to gather the documents, and each of their attached envelopes. Each had a similar rubber stamp, in fact, on closer inspection and magnification, Wessel realized they were all the same: the stamp of Horst Wendland, Vice President of the RND."

 speer_rnd.50.d:0 "Cologne is a bustling and prosperous city with a rich culture - if your definition of a rich culture was one not torn down by the NSDAP. It would make for a pleasant vacation, but that's not what Wessel was here for. In fact, one of the first sights he saw when he was there was students spilling out from a street corner, chanting vague insults and protests against the government; he and his fellow agents, however, simply passed by them. They were not the focus.\n\nThis was where Horst Wendland made his base of operations for the day, and Wessel received quite the good news about the state of it. At some point in the afternoon, Wendland was scheduled to have dinner with one Hermann Ludke, an admiral in the Kriegsmarine. Why an admiral and the vice president of the RND met up was unknown to him, but he had his musings on the matter. Still, he wasn't here to spy on them. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nIn Germany's decadence, many officials slacked on caring about having paranoia-levels of security wherever they went. Wessel had fully expected Wendland to be just like his superior, but clearly he was mistaken. And thankfully so, otherwise this would've been a fruitless endeavour. A report was leaked to Wessel and his team, brief and to the point. Wendland's main documents were stored in an apartment on the other side of the city, and that the only real security was the hotel staff. Something that his crackshot agents could easily get through."

 speer_rnd.51.t:0 "Hands In The Gaps"
 speer_rnd.51.d:0 "They struck gold. Not only did they arrive just in time, as Wendland seemingly exited the apartment only an hour prior, but the security in the hotel was particularly lax. So lax, in fact, that one of Wessel's agents managed to sneak straight into the entrance. With short radio telecommunications at hand, the agent was slowly guided to the room Wendland had made himself comfortable in, and, after dodging another guard and spending about ten seconds picking the lock to his room, he was in.\n\nThe agent quickly found out that something was off. A large, black object was hidden in the corner of the room, draped in clothing and backed behind a chair, but anything above a passive glance could tell that it didn't belong there. Remembering how the clothes were originally placed, the agent took them off and uncovered... a safe. After relaying this information, some surprise was felt from Wessel's side, but it quickly faded away as he considered his options. There were two, each with their pros and cons.\n\nThe first was to simply bug the system. Wendland was not a very competent nor careful person in Wessel's eyes, so he highly doubted that he would spot that his safe was bugged. It would give easy access to whatever was heard inside his room, though the contents of the safe itself would not be directly uncovered to him.\n\nThe second was to blow the damn thing open and run like hell. It would throw all caution out of the window and make Wendland certain that he knew someone was tracking him, but as long as the contents inside are worth it, the reward would outweigh the risk."

 speer_rnd.52.d:0 "With the agent who bugged the safe, Wessel stood in his office and prepared the audio recorder to playback the important part that they managed to get out after an entire day of searching through what was spoken. Tapping the button, Wessel kept his ears sharp.\n\n"... Oh yeah, and one last thing. There's that place I wanted to empty out. What?"\n"..."\n"No, not that. The other one. The... the warehouse." A few seconds of silence followed by an audible sigh. "No. Alright, I'm talking about that specific warehouse, alright? The one I asked you to clear out days ago, but you still haven't gotten around to doing it. What's that?"\n"..."\n"I see. That doesn't matter now. I'm giving you the order again - the warehouse. Tell some of your agents to move the files somewhere else by the end of the week. Yes, tell them to go to Leverkusen, and-"\n\nLetting go of the button, Wessel looked up at the agent. "And that's all that's important?" He asked, and the other man nodded. Wessel stood up to his full height and gave the man a a brief nod back. "I want our agents set out immediately - preferably by airplane. We don't know how much time is left on our hands, and whatever is in that warehouse is important. You are dismissed.""
 speer_rnd.52.a:0 "With a crisp salute, the man left the room and Wessel to his scattered thoughts."

 speer_rnd.53.t:0 "Perhaps Too Well"
 speer_rnd.53.d:0 "Wessel had decided to personally visit the warehouse in the day leading up to the trip. He himself wasn't certain why, but he simply had a desire to see it with his own eyes. Thankfully, the entire process was far less troublesome than any pessimistic expectation he had. There were no dramatic encounters, only an empty warehouse with even emptier contents. It took them ten whole minutes of searching before they found something. In a boarded-up room, one of Wessel's agents found a table with documents and tape recorders.\n\nInitially he sent an agent to examine it, but after just a minute he returned to Wessel and told him something that stopped him in his tracks and made his ever-professional facade break for a moment. Asking the agent to guide him to the room, Wessel was left alone with the contents on the table, now laid out at his disposal.\n\nHe played one tape recorder, then another, then another. They all played back the same voice. His own professional demeanor reverberating back at him. And occasionally, another voice joined in.\n\nGehlen's- and the contents of these discussions were all about Büro Wessel and its activities. Something beyond Wendland's reach. This was no petty crime, and as Wessel left the room, his mind began stirring. It was impossible that Gehlen let his vice president run amok so freely, taping conversations. Even for a man as bizarre as his superior, he didn't consider him to be that incompetent - and so the worry in his mind refused to go away as he and his agents abandoned the warehouse and wiped any trace of their presence clean."

 speer_rnd.54.d:0 "He hadn't remembered how long it had been since he had done something like this. For the past few days Büro Wessel, from an outsider's perspective, looked like it was in a state of disarray. Wessel himself, however, knew the machinations of bureaucracy. He prepared orders, he scouted locations, he made sure that the points were covered and that the loopholes were closed. There was nowhere for this insubordinate to go. Nowhere to run. All the secrets that Wendland had been hiding from him would be revealed, whether he wanted to or not.\n\nAt the crack of twilight, Wessel stood tall, facing down the stoic gazes of about seven agents, all looking at him, all betraying no emotion on their face. "Today, you will spend the entire day searching for a single man in this city. We've put down a few locations, and you will each visit them together. Do not separate, do not stand out, do not hesitate. Your goal is to do only one thing, and I expect you to succeed with haste." They all gave sharp salutes in tandem with each other, Wessel nodding once.\n\n"With my authorization, Horst Wendland is now considered a wanted man in Germany and its subsidiary territories. The charges are treason, insubordination, and conspiracy against the state. Do you all understand?" He asked, and to that the men responded with a "Sir, yes, sir!""
 speer_rnd.54.a:0 "Find Horst Wendland and arrest him at once - dismissed!"

 speer_rnd.55.t:0 "Secrets Wide Open"
 speer_rnd.55.d:0 "The explosion that rocked the room and was heard throughout the whole building sent the skeleton security team into overdrive, but miraculously enough, the agent for the job managed to slip by and escape with the contents of the safe. By that night, they were laid out in front of a table, Wessel himself looking over what was stolen from Wendland. He only wished that blowing their cover - literally, in fact - would have been worth it.\n\nPapers and files, cases and documents. All things Wessel handled gently, but all things that served no purpose to him in the end. They were all about other things not related to the Büro Wessel, or Antifa, or the student protests. Frustration that was present in his mind only grew throughout the night, until after about half an hour of searching, there was nothing.\n\nExcept the one thing yet to be researched. There was an undeveloped roll of film, waiting to be explored. With only one avenue left, Wessel pursued it with intent to find out if this whole operation wasn't just a waste of time."
 speer_rnd.55.a:0 "Perhaps there is a silver lining in all of this..."

 speer_rnd.56.t:0 "Cut Through The Fog"
 speer_rnd.56.d:0 "The few days Wessel had to wait were painful days. There could have been quite possibly anything on that film, ranging from the most trite, pointless things completely unrelated to what he was doing to... things he didn't want to waste his time thinking about. After all, it was only the results that mattered.\n\nAnd the results eventually came. In his office, he was handed the developed film by an agent of his who hadn't looked at it, and then promptly left the office, leaving the man by himself. From the top, he uncovered his thumb to look at the first picture of the set, and...\n\nWessel felt his heart drop. On the first picture - the very first - there was an image, clear as day, of something being pictured against a wooden table. On a closer glance, he could make out the markings and the design. This was no ordinary document. This was a document that belonged to the Büro Wessel. Then another picture - this time it was open, revealing its incredibly damaging contents inside. While his face was stoic, his mind was in a whirl. Drawn in by the shock, he looked at another image, then another, then another.\n\nBy the end, it had been a long time since Wessel felt such anger brewing in him. But it was driven with a purpose."

 speer_rnd.57.d:0 "The sight of Wessel standing in front of Wendland's cell gave him endless shivers. He was not appreciative of the man's cold, empty, fury-filled stare, not at all. When he eventually spoke, Wendland nearly jumped out of his skin. "Don't waste my time, Horst." Wessel almost snarled. "I want you to answer a few simple questions for me." Wendland backed away, his face already paling. "N-no, wait, what do y-you mean by 'simple questions'?" He asked back, and Wessel merely stared at him further.\n\n"What reason did you have for taking pictures of top-secret documents belonging to the Büro Wessel?" His was a voice of stone, betraying nothing, but those familiar with it could make out the invisible intricacies. The purest sense of anger. Wendland only managed to stutter a few meaningless words before Wessel cut him off sharply. "Full sentences. Scattered words do not answer my question."\n\n"I... I c-can't tell you! If I-- if I did, I'd-I-I wouldn't-" Wessel loudly sighed. "Next question." His eyes narrowed even further. "How did you manage to take these pictures? You are--were, under the direct oversight of Reinhard Gehlen." Something was implicated in his words, and Wendland's eyes widened. "No... no, don't ask me that! Don't ask me that!" He yelled, and Wessel's posture refused to change as he spoke. "Who were your associates, Wendland? If you can't answer that, I'll have to pass you on to my other agents."\n\nHe backed up behind a wall, and kept his hands tight on the uncomfortable bed below him. Tremors ran down his limbs, and he couldn't help to stop the incessant shaking of his head, telling him to look away. "God, no, please, I can't-I don't..." He trailed off, and Wessel raised an eyebrow. Would he finally speak? He was almost about to feel some relief when Wendland suddenly shut his eyes tight and made a strange noise akin to a grunt and a gasp, as his head rolled back. When Wessel saw that, his stance broke, and he muttered the slightest 'no' before shouting an order for his agents to come over."

"Felfe had indeed infiltrated Chornovil's group, and was aware of my presence in Ukraine, but he had no intentions of ever contacting me. He was killed in a firefight with another group - mercenaries of some sort."\n\nReinhard took a drag of his cigarette. The corners of his mouth tightened ever so slightly. "And you thought it necessary to attempt to contact him, to risk his mission, a mission your Büro had no part in? For all you know, you led these men right to him."\n\n"No. This was a coordinated, pre-planned attack. I was lucky to even see him alive." Wessel noticed the smallest twitch as Gehlen responded.\n\n"You spoke with him?"\n\nCurious. "No. But I overheard enough. He was a double agent. He had been feeding them information ever since he joined. Why?"\n\nReinhard leant over the desk and ground his cigarette into the crystal ashtray. "You seem to forget who is debriefing whom, Herr Kätzchen." Gerhard internally grimaced at the all-too forced codename. "I do not like what you imply. Felfe was a traitor, and his treachery caught up with him." He looked pointedly at Wessel. "You are not privy to the details of every operation this organisation performs. I suggest you get used to that fact."\n\n"Verflitzes Kätzchen" glowered, though his face remained a mask of patience. As he wished. If "Kleiner Fuchs" wanted to play his cards close to his chest, so could he. He would stay in his lane - but where his Büro's lane went was his business."

"These," he continued, pointing fingers at the pictures in front of Gehlen. They were... damaging, to say the least. Proof that Wendland had taken pictures of top secret info that only Wessel's agency would have access to. "What are these, sir? How did the vice-president of the RND get these images? Not only that, he committed suicide via a cyanide pill when questioned about it."\n\nGehlen, after a long period of silence that only served to further annoy Wessel, sighed. "Agent Verflitzes Kätzchen..." He began, pushing the pictures towards him slightly. "These questions shouldn't concern you. They should concern me." He said, voice tightening slightly. "I know the trigger for his suicide. When you asked him about who these pictures were for, correct?" At that, Wessel's breathing became just a bit heavier. "Are you looking for something, Agent... ? A sort of... conspiracy, perhaps?"\n\n"Sir." Wessel returned, staring with an attempt to scan Gehlen's emotions. They were not pleasant. "I am not making any claims. I just want to find out why Wendland took these pictures, and why he committed suicide. If I can get the help of the RND..." Gehlen shook his head. "No, no, no. Agent, you misunderstand. I never requested that such a thing like this be in your portfolio when I gave you your own agency." Gehlen's frown turned into a light smile, and Wessel felt like he wanted to grab on to something. "This is not your problem to deal with. It is mine. I suggest... downscaling your ideas of what you should do and realizing what you should not do."

The bracing wind forced him to pull his coat closer to himself, and he quickly entered the black Mercedes awaiting him. "Pleasant trip, sir?" The agent sat opposite him proffered him a file, and gave a tap on the glass between them and the driver. The car pulled away with a purr.\n\n"As good as it could be in this weather." Gerhard opened the file. He had read it before but he preferred to commit information to memory. Paper was unreliable. "Where is Felfe located. The sooner we find out what he knows about the autopsy, the better. "\n\nThe agent looked down sheepishly. "I'm afraid we've been unable to locate him, sir. As soon as I arrived I swept his known hangouts, but by all accounts he hasn't been seen in over a week. We searched his home top to bottom, but no luck."\n\nWessel gave an almost imperceptible frown. The agent's head lowered further. He had expected complications, naturally - complications were nine tenths of his work. Without Felfe, however, this lead was a dead end. Felfe was apparently only person left to have seen the autopsy report, and the fact he hadn't already revealed it indicated he was saving it for someone else.\n\nThe car slowly pulled its way through the streets of Kyiv. It was a difficult task - the roads were potholed and clogged with a mixture of ancient Soviet vehicles belching smoke and imported German cars, seeming all the more grimy for their spots of gloss black. The signposts were a confusing mixture of German and Ukrainian - both in Cyrillic and the bastardised Latin script that had developed from the confluence of cultures.

It was remarkable what you could learn just from walking the streets, visiting the bars, finding the feel of people.\n\nNaturally, the Ukrainians and Russians remained churlish against the Reich, with many a drunken curse raised against the Germans. While his agents had indeed determined the presence of local resistance movements, both left and right, they were not his concern. No, it was what he had found in an alley behind a decaying beer hall that disturbed him.\n\n"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit". Not words he had expected to hear in this place, the severed half of their national anthem. Well, one of them, he smirked. He tossed the pamphlet back to his desk, the black, red, gold seeming to glow in the light. Reichsbanner had beaten him here - a deeply disturbing prospect. He had expected locals, but for German insurgent movements to have travelled this far East?\n\nThis all but confirmed it - Felfe's previous mission regarding the Ukrainians was only a secondary concern to him. Felfe no doubt knew Reichsbanner had been here, but had never reported it. He had been compromised. A skilled infiltrator, Felfe would have attempted to worm his way into the local resistance. Gerhard knew not where to find Reichsbanner, but his Büro had leads on the Ukrainians. He would find the man, by hook or by crook."

No claim that outrageous holds up to close inspection however, and a few smashed printing presses later revealed that the author, one Viacheslav Chornovil, occupied the deep forests outside Kyiv along with his band of outlaws. Chornovil was viewed as something of a Robin Hood figure by the locals, and had been a great disturbance in the region to Wessel's colleagues. Thus the Büro began its search, finding a remarkable lack of dissidents and a surfeit of trees. It was not until one agent quite literally fell into the answer, that they located a tunnel.\n\nOne geologist and several aerial surveys later, they determined the locations of the other entrances. Thus, Gerhard waited, lying under a pile of branches and camouflage netting. Two other entrances were monitored by his two best agents, and they had made note of the incomings and outgoings of the sizeable tunnel complex - more than two dozen separate people were noted. Wessel made a mental note to order any similar networks rooted out immediately. Through his binoculars, Wessel noticed motion. Glancing at the blurry photo captured yesterday, he recognised the moustachioed face of Viacheslav Chornovil clambering from a cramped tunnel, before sitting on a rock and lighting a cigarette. Gerhard exhaled sharply as he recognised the second rising figure as Heinz Felfe.\n\nGerhard cursed himself for the distance at which he had placed himself - overly cautious, he could not hear their words.

 speer_rnd.66.t:0 "Spy vs Spy"
 speer_rnd.66.d:0 "Maintaining the flow of information was Wessel's job. No decision should be made without the most complete knowledge of the situation possible, and it was the Reichsnachtdienst that kept these channels of information open - or so he had thought. It seemed Reinhard had fallen into that old spymaster's trap, the hoarding of knowledge for his own sake. It was therefore up to Wessel to restart the flow.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the headquarters of the Reich's foremost intelligence agency was just another office building. Cleaners have a unique ability to go unnoticed in a crowded room. All too easy for a loose sheet of paper or a cassette to fall into the bag while its owner was preoccupied. A microphone concealed within a lampshade might be noticed in an office, but nobody would even consider searching for one behind the bowl of a toilet, and conversations become less formal when one has their fly undone.\n\nGerhard now enjoyed the fruits of his labours in his office. The unmarked cassette was playing into a pair of headphones. The fact that this tape existed at all was damning enough, but the contents disturbed him greatly. The recording was of a phone conversation - at one end Gehlen's crackling voice; the other, the unmistakable tone of their Führer Albert Speer. He listened to it to its completion, then removed the film from the tape, concealing it within an empty bottle of pills. Gehlen was a true rogue agent, at the head of one of the world's largest intelligence agencies. Reinhard was smart, and revealed much while demanding nothing - nonetheless, Gerhard could recognise the hint of extortion.\n\nTruly, nobody was without sin - Gerhard had known many of the darker secrets of the Reich, but could only hypothesise whether Speer had been party to them. If Gehlen revealed any of what he had found, the Reich would collapse in on itself. Speer had buried his past deep yet Gehlen found it nonetheless. A stark warning of what he was facing. If he was to act against Reinhard Gehlen he must act fast - for the safety of the Reich that his mentor had so clearly forgotten."

There were only a select few he could trust with this information - he could only pray he would reach them before Gehlen realised what was missing. He marched through the office floor of the Büro Wessel, giving dismissive nods to those who met his gaze.\n\n"Excuse me, Herr Kätzchen? I have a message for you."\n\nGerhard turned to see a man in dark sunglasses. The man extended his right hand with a slip of paper, clearly expecting him to take it. His left was lazily resting in his coat pocket. Wessel reached into his pocket as though reaching for a pen; his eyes darted from side to side, establishing the visitor was alone. The man's eyebrows furrowed, and the corner of his mouth turned as he realised his bluff had been called.\n\nWessel pulled his penknife from his pocket all too slowly, as the man's left hand emerged from his coat holding a slim pistol. In one smooth motion the man's arms straightened, the oversized suppressor brushing against Wessel's ear as he jerked to the side. Its detonation nonetheless deafened him and threw off his balance, and he fell into the assassin in a tangle of limbs. A blind thrust of the blade made contact and he stabbed, the knife finally connecting with the man's throat.\n\nWith a gurgle the man in sunglasses expired. Wessel arose, clutching at the side of his head. The bullet had grazed his skull, and from what he could tell taken most of his left ear with it. The shot had roused the rest of the Büro, and Wessel had to slam down the telephone of a wide eyed secretary who was in the process of calling the Orpo. Whatever number was dialled next, Wessel could guarantee it would not be the one that picked up.\n\nHe barked out swift orders to leave. His Büro had planned for a situation similar to this, though he had never thought they would ever be implemented. His staff would scatter, and the Büro would go dark. He, however, had a meeting to attend. If Speer was compromised, he had to find the next best thing. Exiting through his own secret door, hidden in a den of electrical wires and transformers, he turned up his collar, put on his hat and made for the Reichskanzlei."

The Chancellor had assured him of the man's trustworthiness, but that did not stop Gerhard from uneasily glaring at him whenever he went to produce some instrument from his bag. He attempted to piece together the recent events in his head, whilst he had a moment of peace.\n\nDutschke's murder had been the flashpoint, and Gerhard was now all but certain Gehlen had ordered it. Further still, Bachmann had been eliminated to throw Wessel off the trail. Gehlen's Büro had been hoarding secrets, making hidden contacts, selling information that was not theirs to sell. They had actively been working against Wessel's own agents from the beginning. To what end? And most damning of all, Gehlen was extorting the Führer himself - one last insurance policy in case the depth of his double-dealing came to light.\n\nHow had this happened? Reinhard Gehlen was an intelligent man, one Wessel had looked up to. Now, Gehlen had sunk to sending hitmen after him in broad daylight. He was sloppy, out of touch, and most of all he could not be trusted. Trust was everything in their business - who to trust and distrust decided who was alive and who was dead. He turned to look out of the window, and glimpsed a dull red glow.\n\nHe shook off the protesting doctor, and went to the window. In the distance were the party rally grounds, the great theatre in which the NSDAP had performed their ecstatic rallies ever since Hitler took power. In the centre was the Ehrentribune, the vast podium wreathed with swastikas from which he had spoke and yelled and cried, which to many represented the golden days.\n\nIt was burning."

If slavery were to be abolished at once, the Reich would collapse, for few Germans had maintained the skills required to manage an industrial economy. Of course, this message went unheeded by the slaves themselves.\n\nKZ Monowitz, a work camp producing synthetic rubber for IG Farben, had suffered in productivity this last month. The predominantly Polish workers had attempted a campaign of passive protest, gathering in their hundreds and refusing to work until their demands were met. These demands had included increased rations, shorter working hours and the right to contact their families outside in what was once Poland.\n\nUnfortunately, these demands had not reached the capital by the time the protests had been dealt with. The camp guards, some of whom had been dealt a beating before being expelled had received encouragement from the camp's management in IG Farben, and with support from the local Orpo force bloodily retook the camp. Fatalities had been estimated at up to 70% of the workforce. The duty of Wessel and his Büro was to improve future camp security, and prevent the spread of protests."

Attempt to cordon them in one block and they acquired a supernatural knowledge of the way out. Reports from one end of the city of spontaneous riots would turn out to be false leads, allowing further damage in other areas. Every time they attempted to contain the protests they found some way around, creating the constant background of yelling that seemed to encompass Germania these days.\n\nDamnation, but Reichsbanner was good.

While all were reluctant to send in the army, it had been accepted to use off duty servicemen and party members in old police gear. Still, the line seemed all too thin.\n\nHis investigations had been slow. These protests were organized - radio frequency scans had revealed encrypted transmissions of a type that none of his cryptographers had been able to break yet. That the code would be broken was inevitable, for his Büro had unofficial access to the largest supercomputers in the Reich - the question was, would that be soon enough? If Reichsbanner were responsible they were proving smart enough that more than likely they would have shifted to new frequencies and new codes by the time they RND had broken the encryption.\n\nHe allowed himself a cigarette - a rare luxury. Addiction was a weakness, but it had been long enough that he didn't care. Whoever was behind this had funding and brainpower, enough to stay that one step ahead.

Kurass's official report states that he acted in self defence when Muller attacked him with an improvised weapon. Muller's friends, when later questioned, would state that Muller was dragged into an alley by Kurass and his comrades. The post-mortem examination confirmed that Muller was shot in the back of the head. The results had not been published, and the internal investigation had soon been called off. Kurass would be remanded internally, for to bring charges against a police officer at this time would be dangerous. \n\nWessel cursed the thugs they hired to the Orpo, cursed the whole sorry affair.

RND operatives had been unable to uncover little of their operations other than their presence, and the fact that wherever Burgundian agents went, chaos and destruction soon followed. He'd heard unsubstantiated reports that they were behind virtually every political assassination in every country in the past twenty years, and partisan movements across the globe had been noted to carry arms bearing arms traced to the Silent State. \n\nThe motives for these operations were still unknown, with a single shred of concrete information from stolen SS documents in Italy sent before their mole went dark - the operations all contributed towards Himmler's Globalplan.

Without the threat of a powerful enemy, corruption and infighting began tearing the Wehrmacht apart in what historians would probably call "a twisted parody of the Late Roman Empire"\n\nLike the Roman generals they were so fond of, the highest German officers bought the loyalty of their men by promising hefty bonuses at the end of their service, siphoning the needed funds from the Reich's budget with the subtle threat of open revolt should anyone refuse them. As a result, the Wehrmacht bloated horrendously, eating more and more of the public expenses and contributing to the final collapse of the German economy. The increase in dimensions, however, didn't result in a better military: on the contrary, overloaded logistics, unfit recruits, outdated equipment and infighting between officers turned what was once a jewel of efficiency into a wheezing sick patient, as the Second Russian War showed perfectly.\n\nNow, with the civil war over, Von Tresckow has planned a large reform of the German armed forces to return them to their former glory. The program will concern all of the Wehrmacht, from the Heer, to the Luftwaffe, to the Kriegsmarine: everything will be turned upside down, until it fits his ideals once again. However, this won't be an easy task: many officers of the old guard are still in active service and will try to resist the reform at all costs, especially if they are supported by the conservative elements of the NSDAP.

The German air force was the personal playground of Herrman Göring, the main responsible for the current decadence of the Reich, and a large number of officers owe their rank to him: despite his defeat, his political clout is still present, and it will take time and effort to remove it before any real reform can be passed without mass desertions or worse.\n\nGöring's influence, however, wasn't limited to the officers, but it covered even the doctrinal aspects of air combat. As of now, our air fleet is heavily unbalanced towards long-range bombers - the result of a decade-long bombing campaign over Russia and Western Africa - and even worse, due to the gargantuan costs of running such a meaningless operation, there weren't enough funds to develop new airframes to keep up with the new discoveries.\n\nAs a result of this, the Luftwaffe is extremely outdated in both doctrines and equipment, despite its large numbers, and will most likely perform with abysmal results against any modern air force of the world."

This exponential growth, however, overloaded the supply system until it finally broke, and only served to enrich the weapons industry in cahoots with the military leadership.\n\nWith the constant downturn of the German economy, more and more money was diverted towards maintaining this living corpse - the mere thought of cutting military spending was met with subtle threats of civil war - with the result that any kind of research or improvement was halted due to lack of funds. Poorly-trained soldiers, outdated panzers, malfunctioning aircraft and old doctrines were the reasons for the collapse of the German defenses during the West Russian War, but not even this was enough to let the corrupt High Command understand the depth of their mistakes, and the Heer continued its decadence.\n\nWith the civil war over, the Heer has been left reeling from its losses and from the difficulty of serving once more alongside those who mere months before were manning a machine gun aimed at you. This, however, is also the perfect time for reform: Von Tresckow has a clear idea of what he wants the German army to become, and he won't stop until it has become reality.

The West Russian War saw spelled even more cuts for the navy as the generals took more and more funds for their pet projects and to feed the bloated monster that was now the army.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out, the Kriegsmarine sided with Bormann, but Dönitz decided to retreat to Crimea, realizing that no matter his allegiance, there was no way the navy could do anything except getting either sunk or scuttled.\n\nDespite surviving the war almost untouched, however, the Kriegsmarine is in a dire state. Years of neglect have left the navy small and obsolete, with most ships dating back to the last war: as things are, a total overhaul is needed in both doctrine and equipment, to bring it back from the dead and turn it into a modern fleet. Despite the resistances of admirals formerly close to Dönitz, von Tresckow knows a new and powerful Kriegsmarine is necessary if Germany is to return at the forefront of military innovation."

speermilitary.12.desc:0 "Even in this forgotten corner of the world, Germany refuses to let anything slip from their claws.\n\nA communique arrived via radio broadcast just hours ago from the Reich; though communications with the continent are usually verbose in tone, this message was brusque and brutally clear. Berlin demands complete surrender and the return of the islands to the Reich or else within 48 hours a state of war would exist between us. Given the predisposition of Berlin and the unnaturally lethal tone of the message, we have been given every reason to believe that they intend to make good on their promise.\n\nOur forces - those that will follow our orders at least - are being made ready, though none hold the delusion that the Reich's warmachine could be bested. Perhaps, however, they will not have to be. Given our geographical position and relative miniscularity, it is unlikely that they would bring to bear the entire Wehrmacht against Madagaskar. As such, if they send a proportionate force it is possible to resist and make a quick invasion turn into a grueling exercise in hubris.\n\nBut even so, not even our most optimistic officers expect this assumption to prove true, as the Germans are just as likely to rain ordnance on our heads until we throw down our weapons or die in the process, and it's likely they don't much care which outcome arises first. Ultimately, the ruthless calculus of war has a habit of reducing one's choices. Our future can only lie on one path; do we stand down and submit the islands to the Reich, or make Berlin come and take them?"

When their reply was not made ready quickly enough, an incoming fly-over of the island by our bombers served to catalyze a faster response. As of right now reprisals are planned, but we are working to ensure that sufficient control of the islands and the surrounding waters are achieved first so as to avoid any last-minute complications; even as we are past the point of armed resistance, we intend to avoid the possibility of further issues arising.\n\nThough ownership of Madagascar and its islands is important to the dominance of those southern seas, the true fruit of this endeavor is the public image of a once rebellious land willfully submitting to the rightful rule of our administration. What could have potentially been a disastrous military conflict has instead been transformed into an example of the statesmanship we embody; hopefully we will not need to make a similar example for some time."

The islands of Madagascar not only project vital power along the African coast and the Indian Ocean, but by allowing it to fall to a - ultimately suicidal - seperatist force has resulted in a poor image for the Reich. Our attempts to unify our sphere are crucial to the continuing survival of Germany, and a rogue nation demonstrating the ability to slip free from our authority may result in a domino-effect for our less compliant lands. Therefore, if they seek to become an example to others, then we shall make them one.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine has been notified and is being made ready to leave their moorings to prepare for the invasion, army groups are being formed and instructed on how to retake the island, and munitions are already being tasked to air-elements in the region to soften it for our arrival. This affront to the lawful authority of the islands cannot be left to stand and, though it is regrettable that it has been forced to come to this, we must now prepare to make these wayward sons aware of that fact."

"It is literally incomprehensible to me that our armed forces would be unable to reconquer fucking Madagascar. It's Madagascar, for god's sake! Did our intelligence not suggest that they recently had a fucking five-way civil war? Seriously Generalfeldmarschall, what the hell? How is this even remotely possible?". The Generalfeldmarschall did not know how this was possible, so he did not bother to reply.\n\nSpeer calmed himself down, and was thankful no one else was here to witness his highly unusual outburst. To be fair, could he really have been blamed given the ridiculous circumstances? "Well, as humiliating as it is, let us prepare peace negotiations for whoever the hell is even in charge of that god-forsaken island. I suppose they'll simply want their sovereignty to be respected, and perhaps a few other small concessions."

While we fought back as hard as we could, it only took so long for the Germans to seize these small, hardly populated islands.\n\nThere is no choice for us but to surrender to Germany. Hopefully they will at least be lenient and merciful, though history suggests that this is not likely. The islands of the Indian Ocean have changed colonial masters several times within the last few years. When they will probably never see true independence, what is one more changing of hands to the peoples who inhabit them?"

Though our people probably do not care in the slightest about some tiny islands thousands of kilometres away, we at least have something to demonstrate the success of our administration and the restoration of the Reich's global strength," responded Speer. "That will be all, then."\n\nIt might have been all for Madagascar, but it will not be all for the reconquests demanded by German Imperialism.

It could just be to retake the strategically valuable islands of Mauritius and Reunion, or perhaps they have worse in mind, but either way we know that Germany is actively preparing to invade our territory quite soon.\n\nIt is hard to see how this is a winnable fight for us, but we will not abandon any of our people or territory.

However, an airplane is much more complicated than a gun or a tank, and even the testing process reflects this: once the research department has finalized the proposed designs, the testing truly begins with the flight tests.\n\nIn this phase, unfortunate pilots are put at the helm of what can range from a perfectly-functional jet fighter to a flying coffin only waiting to close itself on the poor sod. Takeoff accidents, on-air engine failures, sudden airframe detachment, and many, many more: the list of the problems experienced by testing pilots is only as long as the list of the causes of their death, and many promising aviators have met their untimely end just because the one in charge of development forgot to factor a zero, or to put a comma where it was needed.\n\nStill, no one can deny that the results of this tear-filled process are extremely promising, and so the airstrips of the military airports across the Reich fill with strange, barely-flying planes challenging the laws of physics with frames barely kept together with glue, thread and the fervent prayers of their pilots."

"Such a perfect time to fly" he thought with a small sigh, then he chuckled: his wife always complained that he lost entire hours staring outside the window, but what could he do? He was an aviator, his very soul linked to the endless blue: only his brothers-in-arms could understand the feeling of longing to be up there, high into the clouds, literally on top of the world. Humans however, unlike birds, need artificial wings to reach above the clouds, and he was too old for that now, so he did the only thing he could do: he looked outside, and remembered the old days.\n\nHis gaze passed over the small display case near the fireplace: his two Iron Crosses were there, alongside his pistol and a small piece of the airplane he almost died inside when he was downed the second time. He shuddered at the memory, but even those difficult days were so beautiful, so dangerous, so exciting! Back then, when he had served the Kaiser in Italy and France, airplanes were but wooden caskets with an engine: to think that such things could even fly without exploding! And yet he was witness to their agility and power, and to the bravery and camaraderie of the men piloting them. He remembered the Caproni bomber he desperately tried to take down above Treviso, only for himself to be the one falling to the ground. He remembered flying over Verdun during a night with no moon, the artillery strikes lighting the darkness like a starry sky upside down. He remembered his comrades, his friends, even his enemies, all people who fought with their life to the line, and never surrendered.\n\nA voice awakened Fritz from his small trip into the past, and he realized the sun has long since set. Poor Margarethe, she cooked for him and even had to call him! With a last look to the sky, he got up from his chair, and from the creaks in his bones he could have sworn it was an airplane taking off: his legs were starting to fail him like an old engine. He turned his back to the window and left, but he knew a part of him was still there, staring at the sky."

speermilitary.22.desc:0 "For the entire Wehrmacht, but the Heer more than all others, the Bürgerkrieg was like a scythe wielded by death itself, decimating simple soldiers and officers alike as the fighting degenerated in house-to-house combat, where the entirety of Germany was the frontline, and the command tent was a place like any other to fight and die. The following period wasn't any kinder to the Oberkommando der Heer, as many disloyal, corrupt or incapable officers were systematically purged, leaving a large hole in the officer corps.\n\nHowever, from problems come opportunities, and Von Tresckow knew this very well. The Prussian general spent the years of the reconstruction not only reforming the army doctrines and structural organization, but also training the new generation of officers, to ensure they wouldn't follow in their predecessors' footsteps. One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the Offizierschule des Heeres in Dresden: staffed by the best remaining military theorists, the new institution was made so that cadets from the entire Reich could learn the new doctrines of war in a suitable environment. Of course, said "environment" would be filled with references to the Prussian discipline and the reformist ideas...\n\nDespite the ideological issues, however, no one can deny that the Offizierschule has done an excellent work. The end of the first training cycle, and the subsequent ceremony in which the young cadets took their rank as full-fledged officers of the Heer, marks a new beginning for the armed forces of the Reich: we can only pray that these new generals and lieutenants will prove worthier than their predecessors, and able to keep the Wehrmacht from descending once more into decadence."

Albert Speer looked at him sternly, Henning Von Tresckow standing at his side, his back rigid and a slightly offended expression on his face. The admiral advanced to the desk and stopped, saluting the Führer as protocol demanded even though his demeanor made it clear he would have wanted someone else on that chair.\n\n"Admiral Dönitz" Speer began, his voice severe, "I have called you here for an important matter regarding your conduct during the civil war"\n\nThe old admiral knew it was coming, so he steeled himself for what was to come. "I'm ready to take my punishment if it is needed" he answered with a calm, resigned voice.\n"During the civil war, it has been proved beyond doubt that you took Bormann's side. Not only that, but you also fled the country during the chaos, taking the majority of the Kriegsmarine with you, disobeying all orders to fight and finding refuge in Crimea"\n"I did that to save the Kriegsmarine!" was the immediate answer, but what came next surprised him.\n"I know that, admiral, and through your action, you saved many ships which would have been lost, or even worse, used against us. For this reason, Von Tresckow and I came to an agreed and fitting solution"\nA barely audible snort told the admiral that the "agreement" was mostly on one side, but he focused his attention back on Speer.\n"For Betraying the Reich and fleeing, you will be stripped of your rank as admiral, and formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty. For saving the majority of the Kriegsmarine from certain destruction or capture, you shall be graced, and your decorations will not be revoked."\n\nThe now-former admiral felt a pang in his heart knowing that his service was over in such a way, but he knew it could have been much worse.

After the end of the war, the admiral surrendered himself when threatened with retaliation from the new government in Germania. His hopes of keeping his rank were shattered a few months later, when he was formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty, and tried together with several SS members and generals who followed either Göring or Bormann.\n\nWhen the day of the verdict came, Dönitz stood with the other defendants in the courtroom. The judges entered the room, one by one, and then read the final sentence: the admiral didn't listen what had been decided for the others, though the amount of screams and cries told him that convictions were far more than acquittals. Finally, it was his turn, and it took all he had not to join the rest of the accused in their screams: "The court declares Karl Dönitz, chief admiral of the Kriegsmarine, culprit of treason and dereliction of duty, and for this he is sentenced to be stripped of all his ranks and decorations, and to thirty years of detention"\n\nAs the guards stripped him of the signs of his rank, he didn't protest, and when they brought him away in handcuffs, he didn't even try to resist.

At the given signal, the combined might of the Wehrmacht was unleashed upon the unfortunate earth mound.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine opened fire upon the enemy positions, neutralizing anti-air batteries and grievously damaging several other emplacements. Immediately after, bombers from the Luftwaffe dropped their deadly cargo upon the trenches, anti-tank cannons and machine guns, clearing the way for the Heer. Tanks rolled towards their target, and infantry both motorized and on foot followed in their wake to occupy the objective. Thanks to the radio coordination, there were no instances of friendly fire, and the entire operation was declared a success.\n\nFor the entire time, Henning Von Tresckow looked with a satisfied expression at the scene unfolding a few hundred meters from his command tent. Several other members of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - generals, aviators and even a couple Kriegsmarine officers - were present, all murmuring their approval for how the army reforms were having their desired effect.

This situation called for an open hand however - and a letter penned by an articulate one.\n\nThe Führer lowered the paper and set his gaze on its author who stood before his desk. Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt had shown eagerness at the prospect of reaching out to the Americans. The letter was good - stately but not too domineering, eloquent but not flowery. The letter was not the question. The Americans may have sent arms back when he was directing mobs of students, but now he was at the helm of the ship, who knew what they would want? "I'm sure I don't need to impress upon you the importance of this summit. You represent "\n\n "I do. The Americans want things to cool down just as much as we do. They'll have their demands, but I don't think they'll be unreasonable with our country's history of walking out of negotiations." Schmidt gave a bitter smile.\n\n "Give them what they want, I suppose." Speer glared at the telephone as if anticipating it's angry ring later. "Just be reasonable."\n\n"

Not a bad pick. Hopefully cooperative.\n\n"Greetings-" His English was sharp, lightly-accented. "- Ambassador. Walter C. Dowling, was it? I'm Helmut Schmidt." He gave the man a hand. "Pleased to meet you." Who then shook it heartily.\n\n"A pleasure, Schmidt!" A noticeable Georgian accent, but it passed by Schmidt's foreign ears. "I'm happy that the Reich's finally reaching out." He gave a short chuckle. "Getting concerned that things would get hot."\n\nSchmidt shook his head. "Not at all, Mister Dowling. The new regime is quite open to change. Now... this won't be easy."\n\nThe tension faded into reality. Both of them knew where this conversation had to lead. Dowling gave a short nod. "Yes... I hope you've come prepared.

Speer would have wanted them brought straight to Germania to see his Volkshalle - the Führer thought himself a humble man but how he could stand to see that bulging growth of national arrogance every day, Helmut could not understand. The Americans would not like it, as much as they loved their monuments. Plus, it was fucking freezing in there.\n\nThe door opened behind him. The Reichsminister turned and gave a nod before the messenger could speak - the Americans had arrived. Helmut ground his cigarette into the ashtray that rested on the windowsill.

Schmidt took another drag, and gestured for him to continue.\n\n"Number one. Nuclear parity must be maintained but overall stockpiles must be reduced. An overall reduction in worldwide nuclear stockpiles is essential to maintain peace. Number two. The institution of forced foreign labour in Germany is unacceptable, and while current efforts to end it are recognised the rights of the workers must be improved until workers can be repatriated. Number three. World trade must be renormalised, and trade between our nations would go a long way towards that."\n\nAnother drag - so predictable. Schmidt had considered this days ago.

SPEERUSA.102.desc:0 "The negotiations had continued off and on for several days - the Americans had played remarkably coy with their demands so far, but only a fool would have let the proceedings begin without an idea of what the Americans would demand at the end. In fact it was predictable how unpredictable they were being. Everyone here had clearly learned from the same playbook, which made it all the easier to dance between them with unspoken promises and tie them in knots with double meanings.\n\nReichsminister Schmidt lit his third cigarette of the meeting. The brief head rush it provided gave him as much clarity as it seemed to sap from everyone else in the room - the Amerikaners gave one another an unspoken message that was more of a scream. He had known what they would ask for days ago - those since had just been to decide what he was willing to give. It was a difficult game, one where neither his own government nor the oppositions could know his goals. Thus far however, all was going to plan.\n\n"In order to resume official diplomatic relations between our nations," Dowling coughed, "there must be some concessions." Schmidt took another drag, and gestured for him to continue.\n\n"Number one. Nuclear parity must be maintained but overall stockpiles must be reduced. An overall reduction in worldwide nuclear stockpiles is essential to maintain peace. Number two. The institution of forced foreign labour in Germany is unacceptable, and while current efforts to end it are recognised the rights of the workers must be improved until workers can be repatriated. Number three. World trade must be renormalised, and trade between our nations would go a long way towards that."\n\nAnother drag - so predictable. Schmidt had considered this days ago.

SPEERUSA.10.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction Treaty"
SPEERUSA.10.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as an agreement was struck between the OFN and the Pakt regarding nuclear proliferation. A downscaling in Germania's nuclear arsenal was agreed to in exchange for the United States beginning to scale down, and perhaps end, the embargo presently surrounding the Reich. Peace on the continent was the point of the embargo, after all, and with this agreeable new Reich entering the world stage, it seems unfair to continue the chokehold on them."
SPEERUSA.10.a:0 "They've changed, right?"

SPEERUSA.11.t:0 "Human Rights Treaty"
SPEERUSA.11.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as the Pakt has agreed to introduce new rights for their slave population. A charter will be drawn in the coming months for a full list of human rights to be phased into the Reich's government, drawing inspiration from those that American citizens already enjoy. Talks began about perhaps expanding this to an international agreement on the subject, but for now, Germania will retain mastery of this legislation. In return, the United States agrees to reduce the embargo surrounding the Reich. The immorality of national socialism was the point of the embargo, after all, and with a more liberal Reich making these first steps, it seems unfair to continue punishment for old crimes."

SPEERUSA.12.t:0 "Germany agree to America First Policy"
SPEERUSA.12.desc:0 "A breakthrough in the negotiations today, as the Pakt has allowed the United States exclusive rights in trade as part of a new 'America First' policy. To bring the two nations closer together economically and symbolically, the United States will have first choice of exports and preference over other nations in the goods produced by Germany. In return, the United States agrees to move to ending the embargo surrounding the Reich. Sometimes, the economic opportunities provided in trade must be considered above mere political ideals, and with a new business partner extending an olive branch, it seems irrational to continue such a destructive policy."

America will now get first choice of German exports, while the large slave population will enjoy new freedoms based on those that the American citizenry already enjoy. In return, the United States agrees to loosen and eventually end the embargo surrounding the Reich. With both an economic agreement and an impactful reform promised by the Reich, the United States would be both fiscally irresponsible and morally destitute to continue the destructive trade blockade."

SPEERUSA.19.desc:0 "In order to earn the favour of the United States, we have agreed to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal. While we of course wouldn't mention it to the Americans, our stockpile is more than large enough that decommissioning a portion of them is not really a major hit to the Reich's geopolitical strength. And though we are hardly naive enough to believe this could ever lead to the total erasure of the threat of global nuclear destruction, this move is absolutely a small step in the right direction.\n\nAnd, arguably more importantly, we are hoping that this significant goodwill gesture will be enough to persuade the Americans to restore full diplomatic relations and to end the embargo between the US and the Reich. We have refused the Americans' other two major demands, but even this relatively smaller undertaking is causing a humongous uproar among the military high command. It'd be nice if the idiots in the OKH were able to realize that engaging in diplomacy such as this de-necessitates the use of their fancy nuclear toys in the first place, but regardless this move is what's best for Germany so we will not heed their inane screeching."
SPEERUSA.19.a:0 "If we'd known nukes were such valuable bargaining chips, we'd have made more of them!"

SPEERUSA.20.t:0 "Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.20.desc:0 "While the most dedicated Nazis and hardcore social conservatives are likely to fearmonger about the potential slippery slope it causes, we have agreed to give the millions of slaves across the Reich a degree of human rights. To those in our administration who oppose slavery for economic reasons, moral reasons, or both, this concession is actually a major relief; because it is a move for the purpose of lifting the trade embargo between ourselves and the United States, those who would disapprove of our decision will be convinced it is purely for pragmatic purposes.\n\nConsidering America's own tumultuous recent history with slavery, we hope that this considerable change in policy will be enough to persuade them that we are worthwhile and ethical partners. Whether or not that is the truth is irrelevant as long as the Americans see us in that light, of course."
SPEERUSA.20.a:0 "Surely Germany will now be a paragon of morality."

SPEERUSA.21.t:0 "America First"
SPEERUSA.21.desc:0 "Let's be realistic. Outside of the Reich, who does Germany even have strong relations with these days? No one in the Sphere, the OFN, or Russia. South America? Not really. If we want to form strong economic ties with one of the world's foremost economies, it is hardly much of a sacrifice to guarantee the Americans first dibs on the bounty of products and services the Reich has to offer. This move will certainly make a restoration of trade much more enticing to the Americans, as it will undoubtedly be a huge boon for their economy and development. As it would be for ours as well.\n\nHopefully, this economic offer is enough to satisfy them, as we are effectively refusing their other two (political and ethical) offers. It's not like the US is a perfectly moral actor themselves, so who are they to judge anyway?"
SPEERUSA.21.a:0 "They probably care more about their imports than our slaves."

SPEERUSA.22.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and America First"
SPEERUSA.22.desc:0 "We have decided to give in to two of the three major American demands: we will somewhat reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile, and will grant the United States unmitigated priority trade access to the many goods produced in the Reich. While we have denied the request to grant our substantial slave population a greater degree of rights, these other two concessions will hopefully not be as potentially harmful to our social fabric and popularity. Of course, we are still experiencing a large amount of hostility from our military and from our few diplomats to non-OFN countries.\n\nmHowever, these sacrifices will ultimately be worth the heavy price, as the economic and geopolitical opportunities which would open up to the Reich if the Americans agree would be monumental. Therefore, we are simply awaiting the American response to our most gracious compromise."
SPEERUSA.22.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.23.t:0 "Slave Rights and America First"
SPEERUSA.23.desc:0 "In what is correctly being considered to be a very large concession, we have decided to agree to the American demands to grant limited rights to the millions of slaves working in the Reich, and to give the Americans priority trade access to all of our goods. Due to other geopolitical considerations, we have refused their third demand to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. Still, there is likely to be major opposition from the most ideological members of the party and the Reich at large, though we don't have much of a choice.\n\nWe chose to make these concessions because the benefits are predicted to outweigh the social costs; we must engage in more trade if we ever want our economy to recover! Let us hope that these policies are enough to persuade the Americans to engage with us, as we would be rather hard pressed to concede anything more. This is for the good of the Reich, and so it must be enough."
SPEERUSA.23.a:0 "A necessary trade-off."

SPEERUSA.24.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.24.desc:0 "In order to appease the Americans, we have agreed to both reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile and grant limited rights to the millions of slaves existing within our borders. While we do expect major backlash from both the military and social conservatives respectively, we are fortunate enough that, in the long term, neither of these changes should cause serious harm to the Reich's social fabric or economy (provided we handle them with the utmost care).\n\nBecause of the significant economic gains we would be poised to make in the event the Americans do agree to open up trade with us, such a generous display of good faith will likely outweigh the costs. Additionally, many worrying reports regarding the extent of subversive political groups throughout the Reich suggest that there might even be a subset of our population which is strongly in favour of these reforms. Though that is hardly any consolation, since it is the resistance of people in powerful positions we have to worry about."
SPEERUSA.24.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.25.t:0 "We Have Agreed to All Demands."
SPEERUSA.25.desc:0 "We have accepted all of the American demands, to reduce our nuclear stockpile, to allow American companies first trade rights in our country, and yes, even allowing more rights for the slaves.\n\nIt's not an ideal situation, but nothing is in this world. The hardliners back home are sure to be in an uproar. The only shining light is that the Americans are ecstatic with us, promising an end to the embargo in the coming months."
SPEERUSA.25.a:0 "We have that, at least."

SPEERUSA.26.t:0 "None of Them"
SPEERUSA.26.desc:0 "The Americans pushed and pushed, and then act upset when we lash back. We will not accept these demands from a once defeated enemy. The Reich is prouder then that, better then that. Now that we have made clear that we will not accept these outrageous demands, they have become mute. Refusing to communicate with us effectively.

Speer has been working tirelessly to ensure their fears, and to show them that these concessions to the Americans were necessary for the Reich to not only heal, but to grow from what it was before. He has given speeches from Germania to Frankfurt, praising the Reich's diplomats, and the Americans for understanding the need for friendship. Soon, he says, all Germans will have their lives improved with the end of the american embargo.""
SPEERUSA.28.a:0 "We can only hope."

SPEERUSA.29.t:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
SPEERUSA.29.desc:0 "Upon arriving in New York City, Schmidt didn't know how to feel. He'd never seen a city like this before. It was cluttered with countless tall, imposing, and- frankly- ugly buildings that left a unique and indescribable impression which could be felt nowhere else on Earth. What was it? This city was so foreboding and yet so utterly charming. Why couldn't a single German city produce this sort of emotion in its architecture? It made Schmidt want to explore!\n\nUnfortunately, reality got in the way of Schmidt's daydreaming. An entourage of diplomatic staff awaited him, and Schmidt was stuck shaking their hands and exchanging pleasantries for what seemed like an eternity. But, Schmidt reminded himself, restarting relations with the United States was of the utmost importance and would lead to the betterment of living conditions for all of humanity. So of course, Schmidt buttered up every last staffer as much as he could without brown nosing, and even managed to engage in some legitimately friendly and amicable conversations. Hell, he even managed to crack a few well-received jokes. But once all of that babble was said and done came the sightseeing.\n\nNaturally, there was beautiful Central Park, flashy Times Square, the monumental Empire State Building, and of course, Lady Liberty herself (admittedly not as large as expected from a distance but still symbolically powerful). Interestingly, Schmidt at one point passed through a neighbourhood called Greenwich Village, apparently home to people and activities his colleagues considered "degenerate," though Schmidt never understood how people's private business bothered others. All in all, Schmidt had rarely had a more exciting day and was completely enthralled by NYC's alluring atmosphere."
SPEERUSA.29.a:0 "New York, New York: A hell of a town!"

SPEERUSA.30.t:0 "The City of Angels"
SPEERUSA.30.desc:0 "As the Luftwaffe VIP plane began its descent, Schmidt couldn't help experiencing a mixed range of feelings upon viewing Los Angeles's skyline. While it was no doubt impressive, it seemed as if it were a work of progress that had stalled and stunted over a decade ago. The abundance of military installations and vehicles surrounding the city's harbour reminded Schmidt that the Japanese occupation of the US's major West Coast Ports had likely crippled the region's industry and thus the growth of what was once the most impressive city on the entire Pacific Ocean. Of course, it wasn't like the Reich was in much better shape after its own self-imposed economic downturn and the Bürgerkrieg. "More lives being ruined by fascism. What's new?" Schmidt thought to himself. But voicing such opinions aloud would be just as damaging to his mission here as it would be to his career (and no doubt his life) back home.\n\nMuch more concerning than the quality of L.A.'s skyline was the quality of Schmidt's reception, consisting of some random, nameless bureaucrats whose names Schmidt begrudgingly decided he would eventually learn anyway for the sake of making a good impression. After enough obligatory handshakes and small talk to drive even the most shallow of aristocrats to madness, Schmidt was finally able to do some sightseeing. There was the lively Santa Monica Pier with an ocean view unrivalled anywhere in the continental Reich, the both elegant and exciting Griffith Observatory, from which Schmidt could see the famous Hollywood sign in need of repair, and the excessive Venice Canals (funnily, now the only Venice Canals thanks to Atlantropa, yet another Nazi failure) and all sorts of other wonderful, if slightly tacky, attractions.\n\nThe bounty of interesting sights was partially marred by Schmidt's necessary security detail, but what really bothered Schmidt was the lack of opportunity to gain a real and honest understanding of how the American people lived day to day. How else could he truly understand what sort of provisions the Americans would surely want in the re-establishment of relations? And, unlike his colleagues, perhaps Schmidt actually gave a damn about the lives of non-Aryan human beings. Oh well."
SPEERUSA.30.a:0 "No time to worry about that now. Off we go!"

SPEERUSA.31.t:0 "Schmidt in the White House"
SPEERUSA.31.desc:0 "It was just a brief and simple event, and largely for the sake of the press anyways, but that didn't mean it wasn't overwhelmingly important. Yet, as he entered the stately White House grounds, Schmidt couldn't carry himself solemnly. He deserved to be jovial in front of the US president and the press. This signing was his success, and more importantly, a success for the downtrodden citizens of the Reich and the United States. Why shouldn't he appear to be happy on the outside, since that was exactly how he felt on the inside?\n\nCracking a gentle smile, Schmidt shook hands with the president amidst the flashing of the journalists' cameras, and together they walked along the North Lawn and up the steps beneath the building's facade. The president approached a podium standing on the porch and gave a rather run-of-the-mill speech regarding the value and necessity of the deal which was about to be officially signed. Then it was Schmidt's turn.\n\n"Don't worry, I'll keep this very short. We are here today because we have finally realized that we should stop shooting ourselves in the foot, and that it is better for us to cooperate. I assure all of you that some of our previous administration's, so to speak, policies which some might have found a little unsavoury are in many instances unlikely to continue in the same fashion as they have for the last several years. I believe that this is a period of drastic change, and just as today is unrecognizable to the world of 25 years ago, the world 25 years from now will be unrecognizable to us today. And so, we absolutely must ensure that our future is one of prosperity and cooperation, and of a higher quality of life for all of our citizens. This treaty is an excellent first step. Thank you very much.""

SPEERUSA.32.desc:0 "The culmination of Foreign Minister Schmidt's goodwill tour, the German delegation has now arrived in Washington, D.C. and is prepared to sign away the embargo between our two countries. Though the détente has panned out headspinningly quickly, we of course arranged for Mr. Schmidt to meet with the president for dinner at the White House.\n\nMinister Schmidt was incredibly polite and even jovial, and had little trouble easing any perceived tension between his and our envoys. Apparently a joke of his even cracked a laugh out of the president, which if true would do much to alleviate the pervasive stereotype that all Germans are humourless.\n\nSchmidt and the president stood before the White House's North Lawn and all of the press to officially sign the document ending the embargo between Germany and the US. May God bless the United States of America, and may God bless our new... partners... the German Reich."

SPEERUSA.33.desc:0 ""Mr Dowling, a pleasure. I hope you find our country to your liking." Schmidt shook his hand like it owed him money, and Walter blinked at the bright sunlight that was assaulting him but a moment after he had left the safety of the plane.\n\n"Herr Schmidt, good to finally meet you" he replied, attempting to assert himself. The United States is eager for our parties to come to an agreement for our mutual benefit."\n\nSchmidt smirked behind his face. Off guard and backfooted was how they needed them - diplomats could be so predictable when they fell back on their instructions. Of course he wouldn't have organised this meeting without having planned every moment himself. The issue was too important to be delegated. He gestured to the vast Mercedes-Benz that waited to shepherd them away, shining a glossy black from windows to tyres.\n\n"Of course, of course, but first you must see the sights. Hamburg is a truly beautiful place.""
SPEERUSA.33.a:0 "Hamburg's canals are one of the loveliest sights in Germany."
SPEERUSA.33.b:0 "The city's gardens are unparalleled in natural beauty."

SPEERUSA.34.t:0 "The Canals"
SPEERUSA.34.desc:0 ""In fact, Hamburg has more bridges than any other city in the world!" Schmidt had seemed laid back at their first meeting, but now that they toured his home town the man had lit up. He gestured grandly at yet another stately bridge arcing across the canal. Walter Dowling was the first ambassador to Germany since 1941 - in fact he was the first American to legally set foot on Reich soil in more than twenty years. They walked together, their staff about thirty feet behind. No doubt they were conducting their own diplomacy behind the scenes, while Schmidt and Dowling did their best to ignore the cameras strategically posed above them.\n\n"It sure is a fine place." Walter admitted. It may not have the great skyscrapers of New York, but the place had its own, subtler history. The great city hall overlooking the Alster, the towering cathedral spire, these charming canals - he knew he was being wooed, but damn if Schmidt didn't know how to do it.\n\nThey turned a corner, slowing to allow the lackeys to catch up. Schmidt reached into his pocket and pulled out one of those seemingly ever-present cigarettes. He offered one to Walter who shook his head - half the charm of the open city was its clean air, and he already had a splitting headache from the morning spent locked up in that smokehouse of an office with the Reichsminister. Walter turned to examine the brickwork, and came to face something he never thought he would see. He did his best to conceal his strangled gasp as a cough, only half succeeding - Schmidt turned to view the line of bullet holes in the wall, the discarded rubbish that littered it's base, and the bare earth turned to mud that formed a long stain stretching into the canal . The hangers-on rounded the corner as well, and Helmut took a long, long drag. Just when he thought he'd located the perfect route."
SPEERUSA.34.a:0 "There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this..."
SPEERUSA.34.b:0 "This is not what it looks like.."

SPEERUSA.35.t:0 "The Gardens"
SPEERUSA.35.desc:0 "One of the most touching moments of the visit was when the delegation visited the restored Tropengewächshäuser, Hamburg's botanical garden. A painstaking effort had been made to bring them to their former beauty: old photos had been retrieved, and from them a team of experts had acquired the original plants and flowers from their exotic homes, and rebuilt the pavilions and paths scattered across what was once a place of peace and tranquility. Just like that garden - that was the message Reichsminister Schmidt was trying to convey - the entire Reich would slowly become a better place for everyone.\n\nEven though the plants were still very young, and the grass still had to cover all the new flowerbeds, the American delegation was impressed by the effort. That is, until a diplomat stumbled upon a small earth mound while exploring a more secluded part of the garden, dislodging a few stones and revealing what was buried right below.\n\nAt first, Helmut Schmidt was annoyed by the commotion, but as soon as he turned away from his conversation with the ambassador, any trace of mirth disappeared from his face along with its color: barely hidden under a thin layer of earth and stones, was a human arm, its decomposed flesh barely covered by a tattered uniform, dried blood stains still visible on the discolored fabric. The workers were called, and they soon started digging: the first corpse was carefully set on the side of the hole, but immediately under it, another appeared, and another, and another. Despite all the prayers running through Schmidt's mind, they didn't stop.\n\nAs the sun started setting, one hundred and fifty-eight bodies clad in military uniform had been unearthed, and now the entire American delegation was turned towards the pale, heavily-sweating ghost of what was once Helmut Schmidt. The ambassador looked at him sternly, and his words felt steel-cold to the Minister, like an executioner's blade on his victim's neck: "Explain this, Mr. Schmidt. Now." and the answer he received was..."
SPEERUSA.35.a:0 "It's truly sad, Herr Ambassador, but it was our only choice..."
SPEERUSA.35.b:0 "It was the only fitting punishment for criminals such as these!"

SPEERUSA.36.t:0 "A Heated Conversation"
SPEERUSA.36.desc:0 "The American delegation found that they were in for a treat. Speer had himself personally been delivered in the Großer Mercedes to the Hamburg City Hall. Upstanding German citizens had transformed the Emperor's Hall into a magnificent dining room, and the tables were set for a great roast dinner, with plenty of drink on the sides. The Krauts and Americans began with a great conversation on cultural comparisons and personal anecdotes, but stalled for a good half an hour as the head of the delegation and the Führer himself engaged in a fierce argument over the differences between capitalism and national socialism. After some time, the foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, stood up and managed to reconcile the opposing interlocutors.\n\nEven if Herr Speer and the delegation may not see eye-to-eye, Schmidt showed that there is some democratic and liberal spirit thriving underneath the Reich. The reports back home to Washington that night were ample in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."
SPEERUSA.36.a:0 "They have had only a glimpse of the German ideal."

SPEERUSA.37.t:0 "Backtrack"
SPEERUSA.37.desc:0 ""My apologies Ambassador - I did not wish you to have to see this. The war left its scars across the Reich, and reconstruction continues."\n\nWalter approached the wall, scraping at one of the chest-high bullet holes with his fingernail. "Who was this?" He kept his voice level. The various secretaries following at their heels pricked their ears.\n\n""You understand, of course, that discipline must be maintained in war. The men dealt with here were the worst of the worst - men who flocked to the banners of the likes of Göring, Bormann and Heydrich for the chance to loot, rape and pillage. Hamburg had the fortune of maintaining a strong student militia, who were able to put them down before-"\n\nAmbassador Dowling had knelt down to pick something up. He stood and held it up to Schmidt's eyes. A high heeled shoe, stained a muddy red. For the first time in a long time Schmidt stumbled on his words - his mouth curled in an ugly expression before he sighed and flicked his cigarette into the canal.\n\n"There was much collateral damage. While the students may have been some of our Führer's most ardent supporters, they were... overzealous.\n\nDowling scowled and dropped the shoe. How many innocent people lay at the bottom of that canal?"
SPEERUSA.37.a:0 "My god.."

SPEERUSA.38.t:0 "Schmidt Explains Themselves"
SPEERUSA.38.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt wore a solemn expression as he narrated to the American delegation the story of the final days of the "Battle for Hamburg" which saw reformist militias face the feared "Verlorene Hoffnung" SS-Division, tasked by Reynard Heydrich to take the city at the beginning of the civil war, when everyone was scrambling to establish control over as much territory and industry as possible.\n\nThe division easily broke through the city outskirts, and started executing anyone suspected of being a Speerite, which meant almost everyone as Hamburg was well-known for harboring reform-aligned sentiments. Then, the militias launched a pincer manoeuver near the university, along the Grinderallee, forcing the enemy to retreat under heavy fire: while most managed to leave, a group of around two hundreds SS took refuge in the botanical garden, but in the end they all either died fighting, or committed suicide.\n\n"I beg you, try to imagine how this beautiful city was after the attack" the Reichsminister pleaded as his audience listened, "Ten thousand civilians had been murdered, the hospitals were full of wounded, the university had been turned into an emergency infirmary, and the obituaries were exploding with bodies so much that we had to store them in the market square: hundreds of innocents and loved ones piled like sandbags, waiting for their turn to be buried without a funeral!" Finally, he looked at the lined corpses with tear-filled eyes, and no one could truly understand whether they were the practiced trick of an expert diplomat, or if one of those "sandbags" after the battle had been someone he knew. "We couldn't bury them. There was no place in the cemeteries, not even for our own people. Sad as it may be, they were buried here not out of cruelty, but to avoid the spread of infection."\n\nAfter a minute of silence, the American ambassador hugged the Minister, expressing his sympathy for the population of this wounded land, and asked him if he was still able to continue the negotiations. Visibly relieved, Schmidt nodded, and they left this small piece of a horrible past behind."

To the American delegation, it felt as if the war had never touched such a place, a snapshot from centuries ago all for them: of course, Helmut Schmidt had prepared everything to make sure this would be a fitting end to the visit.\n\nAfter enjoying a small show on Das Shiff, an old cargo-turned-mobile theater, the bateau docks at the Deichstraße, where a small banquet has been prepared for the esteemed guests. As the German and the American delegations mingle, Schmidt starts to talk with the chief negotiator, a man with a deep love for culture and arts, as well as strong political views.\n"Mister Schmidt-"\n\n"Call me Helmut please, Herr Dowling, we are far from the diplomatic table and we have toiled enough to get this far" came the amicable correction, to which the aged diplomat laughed heartily: "Only if you call me Walter!"\n\nAs the conversation developed, Schmidt realizes that he is being dragged into a political debate. Dowling is subtly suggesting the Reich as it is now would never be able to stand the test of time, and though Helmut agrees in his heart, he can't help but think his duty was to defend the Führer's work: Speer may be an asshole sometimes, and block his reforms with stale concepts such as "moderation" and "not risking another civil war" but openly criticizing him? He wouldn't be so undiplomatic do such a thing in front of a foreign delegation!\n\nAs he takes the wine in his hand, he knows he has to make a choice: counter Dowling's subtle accusations, or divert the course of the conversation?"

It sort of reminds of me of those pictures of Venice your mother kept on the old bookshelf.\n\nAs we crossed through this scenery, we came across a wall smothered with flaky black-red splatters, with what looked like bullet dents too. Mr Harry, as you know, served in the war, and when he saw the horror he knew exactly what it was. He told us when we got back to the hotel. A firing squad! Can you believe these krauts want us to think they're back to normal again, going around shooting their own citizens?

Turns out even the Nazis can make something beautiful.\n\nThat was, until Joe Merriman got lost wandering off away from the group. We heard a scream from a few metres away and rushed over.

They assumed the festival would consist largely of cringeworthy propaganda informing them of Aryan racial supremacy and the glory of the Reich's many military conquests. Luckily, Schmidt had foreseen that issue, and had twisted the arms of the Propaganda Ministry to ensure that only a selection of the Reich's many entertainment and artistic films were chosen for the Americans' viewing. Convincing Speer that impressing the Americans with enjoyable films was more pragmatic than angering them with propaganda was not very difficult.\n\nAnd indeed, the reactions Schmidt distinguished indicated that Das deutsche Filmfestival in Hollywood was at least a mild success. By far the most popular work shown was an ambitious remake of the hit 1942 drama Die große Liebe; its message was subtly shifted from one of commitment to war to being anti-war, but what really caused it to stand out was its new star: renowned comedy actor Heinz Rühmann, demonstrating his versatile acting abilities portraying Paul, the romantic lead. Schmidt overheard plenty of positive comments and perhaps, even, a few sniffles?\n\nIt was hard to say if a few flicks would really help restore a positive relationship between the US and the Reich, but it certainly didn't seem to hurt!"

But Schmidt did not care to attend the airshow, as he didn't wish to be reminded of his time at the Ministry of Aviation; after all, didn't he effectively have a hand in those terror bombings? No, he wouldn't think about it. The sooner Schmidt's diplomatic endeavours succeeded, the sooner Germany could be rid of Nazism, which was all that mattered now as far as he was concerned.\n\nFrom what Schmidt had heard from one of his envoys, the airshow had been another mild success, with the Luftwaffe squadron impressing the Americans with a variety of formations, maneuvers, and one particularly sharp turn that apparently caused a great number of gasps. Well, as long as all of these goodwill gestures were appreciated by the Americans, Schmidt had nothing to worry about.

The crowning of Reichsminister Schmidt's efforts finally comes in an official communique from the American ambassador in Germania: with a great fair being planned in Boston, not only has the Reich been invited, but an entire pavilion has been reserved for its exclusive use!\n\nImmediately, the news is broadcasted nationwide, and an inter-ministerial committee is immediately appointed to oversee the preparations: with the complexity of such an affair, it's only natural that the ministries for the economic, diplomatic and internal affairs work together to ensure the fair turns into a success. The Führer's open blessing to this endeavor underlines once more how much sway does the Gang of Four hold over the German government...\n\nAt the committee's first meeting, after a first opening message by Albert Speer, in which he encourages its members to "amaze the world with the Reich's greatness", everyone starts working in earnest. As soon as the first folders are opened, already an important question arises, one which will influence all future works: what kind of event will the fair be?\n\nSome wish to create a reduced version of World Fair on the model of the great 1937 Paris fair, where the German pavilion towered over all others; members from the ministry of research propose a technological fair, where the greatest progresses of our scientists and inventors can be put on display for the world to look in envy; finally, more than a few voice their support for a very peculiar idea, which is a cultural fair: rather than showing industrial or technological progresses, how about showing the world that which makes our country unique? As no one wants to back from their position, the committee's head is forced to call a vote, and the final decision is..."

Architects and artists from the Reich's most prestigious faculties and circles are called to design the pavillon, and the tycoons are already in line to have their work showcased.\n\nAs the first lines are drawn, however, a sore point immediately stands out: we are going to have an exposition in a country we fought, and defeated, a mere twenty years ago, and there are many who would strongly oppose all our government stands for; should we try to create a "neutral ground" for the fair, removing all symbols of our regime - especially the swastikas - or should we show the world what we truly are?\n\nOf course, the conservatives are outraged that such a thing is even being discussed: we are a National Socialist nation, and Hitler's guidance was what brought us from a defeated nation, to the world's greatest empire! Denying our legacy is a crime against those who lost their lives to make the Vaterland great!\n\nOn the contrary, reformist members, especially those aligned with Schmidt and Erhard, fear that the sight of a banner with the swastika might scare off American investors, and draw heavy criticism from the political establishment, compromising the fair's success: as such, they vocally ask to "tune down" on the symbols of what may be our political ideology, but risks hurting the feelings of our hosts.\n\nAs the discussion doesn't seem to end, the chairman sighs and calls for a vote on the issue: "those who are in favor of removing all political symbols, please raise their right hand!" and the result is..."

As they point out to their colleagues, we are being hosted by a nation we fought with those exact weapons a mere twenty years ago: surely, their veteran associations and the conservative political establishment would strongly disapprove, or even boycott the fair!\n\nWhile some agree with this train of thought, others stand up, and reply that our new discoveries in the military field are extremely important, and will surely amaze the world! We won the world not thanks to poorly-armed conscripts, but with technological excellency and constant improvement!\n\nAs the discussion keeps going on, the committee head calls a vote to settle the matter once and for all: after the hands are counted, the fair will..."

The building itself fills with color as a variegated crowd enters the offices to vie for patronage: woodcarvers with their finest creations, patissiers bribing the members with an enticing offering of pastries and receipts passed from generation to generation, and even a choir in their traditional attire singing outside the office! The committee headquarters shine as it becomes, just for a few days, a melting pot of German culture.\n\nAs time passes, however, an issue arises. This time, however, the line of division isn't drawn between reformists and conservatives, but between "alcoholics" and "sanctimonious prudes" as they have started calling each other: as hundreds of beer distilleries have offered to sponsor the event, and many of them have asked to have their stands and stalls all throughout the exhibition, there is the question about whether to officially endorse the beer companies or keep the fair family-friendly.\n\nThe committee chairman calls for a vote on the matter, not before finishing his beer though..."

The Amerikaner felt welcomed by the elaborately-decorated building, especially since, with the sole exception of the official flag of the Reich present here and there - the only point the Führer was adamant about - it was devoid of any national socialist symbol. The worries of the Gang of Four proved correct: without anything to criticize, the hawks within the American government were silenced, and everyone enjoyed the fair without any kind of polemic.\n\nWith the resounding success of the event spreading like a wildfire throughout the Vaterland, the reformists acquire even more power within the government, something which irks the Führer more than a bit. In the end, however, he knows this will benefit the Reich, and he'll be the one to ultimately reap the fruits of their efforts, so for the moment he has decided to keep his grumblings to himself, and influence the work of the Four with a lighter tough, as any true ruler knows how to do."

This moment was not to be taken lightly.\n\nSmall talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever.\n\nLater, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany.

So, he accepts another glass of wine from the server, and they discuss the pros and cons of Alsatian and Bavarian wines compared to the omnipresent Italian ones, especially now that the entirety of Northern France no longer produces anything worth of note.\n\nThe evening soon turns into night, as the two parties socialize more and more, passing from topic to topic with a spontaneity that is almost unbefitting of seasoned diplomats, but with enough wine, everyone becomes a good friend! As the last desserts are finished, and the waiters begin clearing out the table from the used cutlery, everyone gets up, and all shake their hands before the Americans return to their diplomatic quarters.\n\nA second before boarding the car, Walter Dowling looks seriously at Schmidt: "I know what you are trying to do for your country, Helmut" he begins, opting for once to let go of diplomatic platitudes: "The United States are still unsure about how to truly consider your Führer, whether a true reformer or simply an astute liar, but as long as you are part of his government, I am willing to believe that this country can truly find a way to prosperity after what it has suffered.

When the fair closed, the balance was judged 'sorely negative' and the reformists, like the legendary Cassandra, could only look sadly at the numbers with an expression that said 'I told you'\n\nPerhaps, the conservatives should choose to fight worthier battles..."

As the American public visits our stands, they meet and talk with our people, and learn that we aren't swastika-bearing, Hitler-worshipping, slave-driving monsters like some propaganda depicted us trying to prevent us from being invited to the fair.

It'd be wise to demonstrate that we are no longer seeking the brutal conquest which was, of course, a cornerstone of Führer Hitler's foreign policy, you see." \n An awkward pause lapsed as Speer considered Schmidt's borderline treasonous suggestion. He chewed on the idea for several moments before nodding to himself and saying, "I can see how doing so would be beneficial to our diplomatic efforts, and it might even improve my personal image abroad. But of course, there will be strong resistance from many people here in Germany, especially the social conservatives.

Distancing ourselves from him is absolutely necessary, mein Führer," replied a distant and distracted Schmidt. "I need to go for a walk." Schmidt gave a timid but respectful salute to Speer and quickly exited the building. \n As he walked down Adolf-Hitler-Straße and past the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, Schmidt noticed the many lingering signs of war: former soldiers aimlessly walking the street, some with broken or missing limbs and some begging for spare change; a fair deal of unemployed non-veterans, too; and there were even some buildings that had leftover damage from accidental shelling or bombing during the Bürgerkreig in which so many had sacrificed so much simply for that cunning bastard Speer to enact a slightly less brutal and genocidal version of his predecessor's ideology. \n Adolf Hitler was a man who brought so much unnecessary suffering and destruction to the world. How could the German masses revere him so? Schmidt figured he'd have to emphasize the world's fear and hatred of the man and avoid non-starters like his absurd racial beliefs and genocide.

Suddenly, a call interrupted his rancorous thoughts: he answered, listened, and not five minutes later his men too were in parade at the sides of the road. The commanding SS looked at the ten watchmen, slightly amused: "Is this everything the mighty Reich can summon against the Righteous?" he spat at his counterpart. Then, the earth began to tremble.\n\nBefore the SS could speak again, a Panzer appeared from behind a building, and moved at full speed towards the border. The black-uniformed soldiers remained still as the tank got closer, closer, CLOSER. When only a few meters separated the armored beast from the soft flesh, Rudolf smiled in glee: the men in black took one step backwards, then two, and then everyone was falling in disorder as the Grenzwacht laughed.\n\nWith a loud noise, the tank halted one meter over the border. The SS returned, indignation etched over his face: "You are trespassing on the Ordensstaat! I demand that-" he stopped when faced with the barrel of Rudolf's pistol. "You hold no authority here, Verräter" he spat, feeling cruel joy in the way the other's face contorted. "This land belongs to the Vaterland, and you are unlawfully occupying it. There are no borders within the Reich, and the traitor you call "master" will soon understand it!"\n\nAs he spoke, several trucks unloaded a hundred Heer soldiers, who immediately set up building fortifications. The watchman looked the SS dead in the eye, and his voice was cold as steel: "It's only a matter of time before we return to Paris. Enjoy your black uniform while you can, for one day you'll hang from a balcony, and I'll be the one to push you DOWN" and for the first time, Rudolf saw fear in the eyes of the SS."

The black-uniformed German took the letter and gave it a cursory read: he already knew its content, as it was identical to the speech given by the Führer just the day before, then he put it into his pocket and returned to his position, without any outward sign of either interest or worry. After all, it was nothing but the formal certification of the current state of affairs\n\n"Citizens of the Reich, today is a sad day for our country. As Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler has refused to cede command and face due trial for his actions during the war which tore our country asunder, he is immediately relieved of any office and is to be arrested on sight for treason and mass murder.

SPEERUSA.73.desc:0 "Foreign Minister Schmidt and his diplomatic entourage have arrived on the East Coast and have begun a sweeping tour across many of our coastal states. From hunting in the vast woods of northern Maine, to visiting the native-created Etowah Mounds in Georgia, to touring towns, factories, and other landmarks all over the Eastern Seaboard, the Germans have hopefully garnered a much better understanding of American culture and livelihood. We have at the very least given the foreign minister a highly interesting trip, and hopefully the hospitality we've shown to the representatives of our ostensible enemies will bear fruit in the form of improved relations."
SPEERUSA.73.a:0 "Where will he visit next?"

SPEERUSA.74.t:0 "Schmidt in DC"
SPEERUSA.74.desc:0 "The final stop of his goodwill tour, German Foreign Minister Schmidt has arrived in Washington, D.C. From what we have heard from staffers present with the German delegation, the uncontested highlight of the visit for Mr. Schmidt was his stop at the (admittedly very lovely) Lincoln Memorial.\n\nDespite the supposedly much more impressive works and exhibits of Germania, Schmidt was apparently mesmerized by the statue and stood silently in its presence for several minutes. According to one staffer who was known to embellish his stories, a single teardrop could even be seen in Mr. Schmidt's eye. Either way, he seemed to very much appreciate the memorial and the great American values it stands for."
SPEERUSA.74.a:0 "The Nazi foreign minister admires Lincoln? Probably a good sign."

SPEERUSA.75.t:0 "Schmidt in the Lincoln Memorial"
SPEERUSA.75.desc:0 "This was perhaps the one American landmark Schmidt had seen whose scope even held a candle to the landmarks of Germania. And yet somehow, the Lincoln Memorial put the massive statues and displays of Germany's capital to shame. While the ancient Greek-style building and the huge statue of Abraham Lincoln were by no means simple, the memorial could hardly be considered elaborate or covered in interesting details to examine. But all of the pieces put together- the dimly lit but noble Lincoln sitting pleasantly in his chair, overlooking the steps leading down towards the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument in the distance... it evoked this... feeling inside of Schmidt.\n\nIt was longing. Longing for better days, simpler times, and for leaders with as much honour and integrity as they used to have. No German politician valued liberty (openly) the way Abraham Lincoln did. Why did those in charge today care so damn much about what individuals said or did in the privacy of their own home or in the confidence of loved ones and friends? It was both immensely perplexing and infuriating to Schmidt. And then he realized what he longed for the most: a free and just world.\n\n"Ah yes, because it's that simple and easy... Though I admit the world would be pretty boring if there was nothing I could do to make it a better place." Abraham Lincoln did not reply to Schmidt, but surely he would approve."
SPEERUSA.75.a:0 "And make it a better place, I shall."

SPEERUSA.78.t:0 "This Old House"
SPEERUSA.78.desc:0 "For security reasons, the press had not been allowed in. In fact, the room was dauntingly empty, with just some security personnel, a few diplomats from both parties, and Schmidt and the American president sitting together at the table.\n\nWhile all of the details of the treaty that would be signed had already been sorted out, Schmidt was understandably still stressed about this evening. This moment was not to be taken lightly.\n\nSmall talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever.\n\nLater, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany. "If we can't kill each other, we might as well trade, no?" cracked Schmidt, getting plenty of laughs despite the unfortunate degree of truth buried in the joke."

SPEERUSA.79.t:0 "Schörner's Proposal"
SPEERUSA.79.desc:0 "United States of America was stretched out before them in all its glory. Von Tresckow stood to the left side of the table, his crossed arms betraying the inscrutable expression on his face. Opposite him, Schörner leant over the map, his shadow expanding across the East Coast. He greeted the Führer with a courteous smile that failed to reach his eyes. The two officers saluted in unison with a simultaneous, "Heil!"\n\nSpeer returned the gesture and stared at the map with a furrowed brow. "Let's hear your proposal, Generalfeldmarschall." He trusted the man little, and his military strategies less, but Speer knew better than to deny an audience with a man so influential in the militarist movement.\n\n"My proposal is simple," Schörner boasted, almost dismissively. He waved his hand generally across the land below him. "Warfare is fought in the mind as well as the battlefield. It's one thing to throw empty words at the Jews in the White House; it's quite another to strike true fear into their craven hearts." The hawk jabbed his finger close to the East Coast, and for a fleeting moment Speer thought he was about to argue for a declaration of war against the United States. "We should fly our strategic bombers straight towards internationally recognized American airspace, before turning away at the last moment! True fear will grip the Americans, and their leaders will be on paranoid alert, never knowing when a first strike is truly coming. I call it 'Schwarze Walküre'."\n\n"Herr Speer, this is far too risky!" Von Trescow shook his head in disbelief. Schörner glared at him with the shards of ice lurking behind his spectacles."What if our pilots fail to turn away in time? What if the Americans act prematurely?"\n\n"These mongrels slighted the Reich!" Schörner snapped, his spittle spraying across the map. "They're not stupid enough to retaliate, but it will teach them a lesson they won't forget."\n\nSpeer silently rubbed his chin in thought. Fully implementing Schwarze Walküre would be a powerful show of strength, but a test run elsewhere would certainly be safer. Iceland, perhaps?"
SPEERUSA.79.a:0 "We should trial this tactic with Iceland first."

The test was a success, with all missiles succeeding in their launch, accuracy and detonation over the Atlantic Ocean. The fantastic display of Aryan ingenuity was televised to cheering German audiences across the Reich. Germany, as always, remains superior to all in her firepower.\n\nHowever, a second goal was achieved today. Across the Eastern Seaboard, American families cower in front of their televisions, as an equally terrified President addresses the nation.\n\nFrom Berlin, Speer watches the American address, grinning.

The pilot didn't even need to glance, but he did anyway. Yep, a German squadron was still hanging a bit above and behind the strat bombers. At least another dozen pings were picked on the onboard radar up further behind them. Likely, no, definitely above.100% out of sight, but not out of mind.\n\n"Command, I have visual on five escorts, picking up at least another dozen on my radar, over." A pause. A second, than another.

"No running in the hallway!" he announced sternly to the forty or so elementary children. It took more willpower than he cared to admit to not crack a smile as his students let out the barrage of humble sorrys and yes Herrs.\n\nThe day was warm and sunny; it was a beautiful day to play ball. The teacher watched from the sideline, occasionally passing back a ball kicked out of bounds. Johann felt at ease here at school. Although scars maimed his face,, anyone who knew Johann could vouch for his giant heart. Johann was always calm, and tried his hardest to be fair and kind, to great success. Though they wouldn't admit it to his face, his students only sang praise about their teacher to his co-workers and their parents, to Johann's embarrassment. Still, it was welcome praise; the children gave him purpose. Although he had lost his pregnant wife in the civil war, being a mentor to the next generation of Germans gave Johann hope. Here he was, helping to raise a new generation, and he did so with much kindness. In a way, they were his family. He did however envy the children; not having to join a Nazi chapter to have friends or to particapate in the football clubs. They didn't have to know party politics to be able to swim at the local pool, nor they weren't judged by their devotion (or lack of) to Hitler's cult of personality. They could be children. It was a wonderful time to be young, and he was glad that he fought for that.\n\nThe sound of jets roaring overhead nearly made Johann flinch, his reflexes almost taking control over his body, even after all these years. He took a deep breath. He had to stay composed for the children.\n\nJohann looked above, watching yet another airwing soar above his head, heading northwest, likely following the last hundred or so plans that came before that week. Another batch of strategic bombers. Worrying.\n\nAs the children cheered and waved at the soaring planes above, the seed of worry in his head grew more. Why was there so much traffic in the air? Why were they all moving northwest? He pondered as the planes flew out of sight. A ball hit his leg.\n\n"Herr Steiner, can you pass the ball?" A little girl yelled from across the field. He passed the ball, now absent minded, his smile and good mood gone."

The man hung up the phone. "God damn Germans..." Smith muttered.\n\nNo more than a minute passed before the President stormed into the Situation Room with their Secret Service attachment stalking close behind.\n\n"Who has my briefing?" The President barked. Shit. The currently overworked staff simply had no time to compile a folder. "Over here, sir!" Smith called as he rushed frantically from his desk to the map in the middle of the room. The President quickly stalked over to the large table, where tokens representing airplanes stood placed in the North Sea, red marker scrawls noting the planes' previous locations and their intended route; Iceland. Smith paced around the table, clearly nervous. "Sorry sir, we didn't have time to..." The President waved him off. "Forget the paperwork. What's the situation?" "Well sir..."\n\n"Five German strategic bombers, nuclear capable, are en-route to our bases in Iceland. NORAD has been tracking them for twenty minutes; they figured it was a long distance training mission. However, they haven't stopped their approach, and are heading right for our airspace. We've already scrambled an interceptor wing." A pause. "How many German planes total?" the President asked. "Is it a probe? A full scale invasion? Something else?" The Preisdents voice rose. "What the hell is this?" Another tense second passed. "We don't know, sir." Smith replied flatly. "There looks to be twenty-five planes total, including the five bombers. NORAD has no idea what their intent is, but they are REALLY stressing that those planes are nuclear capable. Most of that staff want us to hit them now to prevent a potential bombing. Most of the guys here..." Smith motioned to the ten or so men feverishly plotting routes and making phone calls. "...including myself believe that the Germans are making a show of strength and have no intent on crossing our airspace. We don't think they're trying to start a war. Still, our response is up to you, Mr. President, and I need your decision, now. An operator in Iceland is waiting for an answer."\n\nThe President wordless walked to the nearest desk and dialed a number. The line immediately picked up. "Smith! The fucking Germans are ten minutes out! I need a goddamn answer, now!" Over the line, yelling and the sound of chaos rang in the background. "This is the President..." The line went silent. As if on cue, the background chatter died as if the call was on speaker. The Situation Room mirrored the silence. The President glaced around the room.

Eighteen of the twenty escorts, shot down. No pilots recovered, and no word from the Americans if they rescued any. I don't know what would be better; writing the letters to the families of brave men killed in defense of the Reich, or having to talk to the Americans about returning our men they captured. This is a disaster." The Führer sighed. "What the hell are we going to do?"\n\nSchörner pulled a folder that he had tucked away, and handed it to Speer. The Führer wordlessly opened the folder and read the proposal. A moment of silence passed.\n\n"Wow. The gall of you, Schörner." Schörner finally spoke. "This was an act of war. The militarists are up in arms and demand decisive action. There is no other..." "Are you fucking mad, man?" Speer snapped. Dropping his voice, "This would start a fucking war! Are you willing to give up everything for postering, for you and the military's ego?"\n\nSchörne glanced at his feet, then looked up. "If we don't respond... we look terribly weak on the foreign stage, and God knows what happens at home if we do NOTHING. That's why we chose Iceland. Small population, but important enough to show the world not to underestimate us. Ever.\n\nSpeer's head dropped. "My Führer, it's a hard choice, but with your word, we can strike back tonight.

The room cheered; all approaching bombers had been splashed. This was followed shortly by, "Enemy fighters engaging, returning fire." The room sat in silence as the dogfight commenced over a thousand miles from the White House. Smith's stomach sank as a young man screamed "I'm hit, I'm hit!" before breaking up. Another American pilot, although calm, reported the same. He at least managed to confirm "Bailing out." before losing radio contact. The American fighters were quick to respond, twelve American interceptors who had been observing near their operational height limit dove down unto the approaching German formation, quickly scattering them, decisively changing the balance of power.\n\nAfter only half an hour, the crisis was over. The Germans just couldn't regain the initiative, and after a dozen confirmed kills, the rest of the formation scattered back to Germany. Both American fighters who had been shot down were promptly recovered, along with several Germans. The mood back in the White House wasn't enthusiastic, however.

Walter Dowling looks at the same time incensed by the rebuttal, but intrigued by the way the question had been put. "Surely democracy is better than all other forms of government!" is his immediate reply, "Men were born to be free, Helmut, and democracy is the only way such natural instinct can be satisfied: under a tyranny, there will always be resistance, and its eventual collapse is a matter of time"\n\nSchmidt understands that by talking in absolutes, this would lead nowhere, so he smiles courteously to his guest, and answers: "And yet the Reich is the result of democracy's failure, Walter. The democratic government of Weimar wasn't able to answer to the demands of the German people, and so it was replaced by a government which could meet such demands of order and rebirth. The results of this are well-known, and I believe I don't need to reminisce the events of the past two decades with you, my friend" he says, putting a bit of accent on the word "friend"\n\nDowling understands that going down this road may as well lead to the visit's failure, and also he has been taken aback by the German's point of view, so he decides to end the debate and directs an equally courteous smile towards Schmidt: "Indeed, our world is far more complex than what we would want to, isn't it?

A U-boat has launched its payload, painting Iceland red with its fierce nuclear glow; brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the stars, and hotter than Hell itself.\n\nSpeer and his top advisors sat in a conference room, waiting. A minute passed, then two. After three, cautious optimism started to spread. Was Schörner right after all? Would the Americans blink first? Another minute. The tension could be cut with a knife. Five. Six. After seven, a faceless administrator cracked a half-hearted joke. Eight, nine. Finally, ten minutes. The ten longest minutes in human history passed with a collective, optimistic sigh of relief. An impromptu toast was raised to Führer Speer.\n\nSieg Hail!" went the cry! And the men drank. To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland. Speer himself even partook, with a thin smile dancing on his lips. The Reich avenged her sons, her honor restored. Another victory for the Fatherland, perhaps her greatest yet! Who would dare to face her?\n\nA senior officer rushed into the merry conference room, breathless and white as a ghost. "They're launching! They're launching everything!"\n\nOf course,the staff, the petty bureaucrats and the oh-so-tough warmongerers fled to the bunker complexes. The sirens sounded, but it would be for naught. Speer knew that the missiles would strike with their deadly payloads within fifteen minutes. It was hardly any time for the citizens to reach the few bunkers scattered across Germany. Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind. As the ground heaved beneath his feet, he had one duty he needed to yet fulfil. He owed it to his people.\n\nThe Führer found Schörner standing besides a grand window facing north. Speer joined him. Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n"So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence. Yet Speer could not speak. In another twenty minutes, he knew the Reich, HIS Reich, his home, would be ash. There wasn't even time for enough people to make it to the bunkers to fill them. The streets were eerily empty, and other than the cry of the sirens and the sporidic booms of approaching doom, the heart of Germany was deathly silent. The city awaited her final judgement..\n\n"This is it. This is how it ends," he spoke again. A moment of silence passed. The ground suddenly jerked; another blast rocked the earth, so violently that the glass in front of the men cracked and buckled. Neither man flinched. Schörner was the first to turn and walk, presumably to the safety of the bunkers.\n\n"This is what you wanted, right?" Schörner stopped, and turned back to face his leader, who had tears welling in his eyes. "Well, how did we do, General? Did we play the part well?" he spat."

A loud bang closely followed by the sound of breaking glass came from the other side of the door. A curse, then silence. Schörner knocked.\n\nWhat the hell do you idiots want?!" Speer screamed.

It was clear that Albert Speer was in a rage; something Schörner had never seen from the usually calm and collected man. Files and papers were strewn everywhere. A full sized mirror in the corner of the room was shattered into a million pieces, specks of blood strewn nearby. Pacing back and forth behind his desk was a disheveled Albert Speer, blood trickling down from his cut knuckles. He looked up and paused; his facing darkening when he realized just who had entered.\n\n"You." Speer spoke, then paused. Schörner, for once, had nothing to say. "Make your report, and make it quick."\n\n"My Führer," he began. For once, he spoke those words without any trace of comptemet. For once, the two were in complete agreement with what had to be done. There was no backing down now. "The U-Boats are off the coast of Iceland, as ordered. They are standing by on your..."\n\nSpeer cut him off. "Did I not give you simple, easy, God damn instructions?" His tone was quieter now, but menacing. It was as if venom came from his lips.\n\n"Ah, uh, yes, sir." Schörner replied without stumbling over too many of his words. Describing Speer as 'frustrated' was definitely an understatement.\n\n"The caption refused the codes from me. Said procedure required him to hear the orders from your mouth." Speer merely stared at the general. Schörner, for his part, remained calm. He walked forwards with his typical confidence and handed Speer a note with a number on it. "The direct line, sir." Speer immediately punched the numbers into his land line.\n\n"Captain Von Steiner, reporting." The voice on the other end spoke calmly, as if rehearsed a thousand times."

Everything went perfectly, in every sense of the word. "What is the response from the Americans?"\n\n"Officially, none, my Führer. Unofficially?

Maybe to show strength. But from men like Charles Lindburg, these incursions were a pain in the ass. Because every week, the Germans did the same thing; five strategic bombers with twenty or so escorts flew towards an OFN base or airspace, and every time they did this, NORAD had to respond as if the Germans were about to strike. Planes had to be mobilized on next to no notice, bases had to be mobilized, and the Armed Forces freaked out. Every. God. Damn. Time.\n\nLindburg was sick of it. His colleges were sick of it. The Navy man on the phone was pissed off and sick of it. But, everyone understood that, knowing the Germans, the one time NORAD doesn't react to a threat seriously would be the one time the Germans struck an OFN base. Life is fickle like that.\n\nThe man in the phone continued to yell. "Twenty five! Twenty five bogies heading towards MY airspace! I want thirty, no, fifty interceptors circling above my HQ in ten minutes!" A loud BANG emitted from the phone. Lindburg winced and rubbed his ear as he put the cold plastic back on its base. What a prick. Lindburg didn't even rise from his desk; they were already scrambling nearly two dozen interceptors; no other fighters were close enough to respond within twenty minutes.

Today would be his trial by fire, the first mission. A voice cut over the radio.\n\n"Falcon squad, this is 2-7, you are cleared to engage priority targets. Over." Yes! It was time to shine! Ever so gracefully, the pilot dipped his plane into a sharp dive.\n\n"2-9, this is 2-7. Do not break formation. I repeat, do not break formation. Over." Fuck. So much for glory. Dejectly, he flipped a switch. Instantly, G-force pushed him back into his seat as the air-brakes engaged. In three seconds, he was back in formation. Patience. The cockpit started to beep as he locked onto one of the titanic bombers. Seven missiles streamed from the Americans, the young man's missile making eight. The air-to-air missiles streamed past, leaving nothing but a red glare in their wake. He watched. Would he be so....\n\n"Yes!" he shouted as his, and his missile alone smashed into a bomber in the rear. Confirmed kill. Hell yeah. The triumph was short-lived. Over a dozen German fighters dove from above as the five escorts close to the bombers scattered, but not before launching their own barrage of missiles. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. A missle streamed right towards his plane. Shit. He slammed the joystick up in an attempt to evade. His reaction was quick, and almost perfect. In fact, if the green rookie hadn't been so fast, the missile would have flown straight into his cockpit; he would have been incinerated instantly. Instead, the midsection of the plane took the brunt of the damage. The jet started to spin helplessly out of control, rolling on all axes. "THIS IS 2-9! I'M HIT, I'M HIT! I'M GOING DOWN!" He looked at his consul in panic. No power. Had anyone heard him?\n\nThe plane was in a hopeless tailspin, next to no control, losing altitude fast. Way too fast. The plane wouldn't stop rolling for a safe ejection. He would have to time this perfectly. He prayed as he grabbed the ejection lever. Would it work? Would he time the erratic movements of the plane just right? The plane spun right side up. He pulled the lever. Nothing.\n\nThe plane tilted about ninety degrees before the canopy popped off and the seat ejected. A sideways ejection. SHIT. The man almost cried as he looked down at the fast approaching water. Is this how he died, on his first mission? No...no. Not like this. The pilot threw all of his body weight back, and miraculously, the chair leveled right side up. Quickly, he deployed the backup parachute.... which immediately deployed. Battered and bruised, the rookie would survive to fight another day."

Five. Six. After seven, a faceless administrator cracked a half-hearted joke. Eight, nine. Finally, ten minutes. The ten longest minutes in human history passed with a collective, optimistic sigh of relief. An impromptu toast was raised to Führer Speer.\n\nSieg Heil!" went the cry! And the men drank. To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland. Speer himself even partook, with a thin smile dancing on his lips. The Reich avenged her sons, her honor restored. Another victory for the Fatherland, perhaps her greatest yet!

Speer knew that the missiles would strike with their deadly payloads within fifteen minutes. It was hardly any time for the citizens to reach the few bunkers scattered across Germany. Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind. As the ground heaved beneath his feet, he had one duty he needed to yet fulfil. He owed it to his people.\n\nThe Führer found Schörner standing besides a grand window facing north. Speer joined him. Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n"So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence. Yet Speer could not speak. In another twenty minutes, he knew the Reich, HIS Reich, his home, would be ash. There wasn't even time for enough people to make it to the bunkers to fill them.

The city awaited her final judgement..\n\n"This is it. This is how it ends," he spoke again. A moment of silence passed. The ground suddenly jerked; another blast rocked the earth, so violently that the glass in front of the men cracked and buckled. Neither man flinched. Schörner was the first to turn and walk, presumably to the safety of the bunkers.\n\n"This is what you wanted, right?"

SPEERUSA.101.t:0 "The Icelandic Strike"
SPEERUSA.101.desc:0 "The Situation Room was in chaos. It was full of men running around, shouting into phones or furiously writing. In the center of the room, a group of men paced around the map of Western Europe, still red from the marking that charted the German air wing the airforce decimated.\n\nThe President burst into the room, still sweaty from his run from the other side of the White House. Normally, people would stop and give them their respects. Today, the President was like any other person; not immediately important to their work, so not important enough to greet. The President scanned the room, and saw a familiar face pointing and writing in a notebook. What was his name... Smith?\n\n"What's the word on the ground?" the President asked as he approached the three men. Two of them scattered, running back to their desks while Smith feverishly lined out potential strike areas in Iceland. "You know as much as me, sir." Smith replied, still working. "Two minutes ago, a German submarine off the coast of Iceland rose to about a hundred meters and launched twelve ballistic missiles at Iceland." He finished tracing lines on the map. "Really? Speer would be so brazen?" Smith shrugged.\n\n"SMITH, SMITH, GET OVER HERE!" a nameless man yelled close by. Smith rushed over. The man punched a button on his phone, and the line went on speaker.\n\n"They're nuclear! I repeat, the missiles are nuclear! Reykjavik has been hit! We have no...." The President zoned out. Wordlessly, he found an empty stool around the war map and sat. After a minute, Smith walked back to the table, and wrote an X on all of the major harbors, cities, and most of the U.S bases and garrisons. Twelve red Xs scarred the map as nuclear fire likewise scarred Iceland. The Situation Room was dead quiet. Finally, Smith spoke.\n\n"Have we tried to raise the airforce in Iceland?" One man wordlessly rose his hand, then shook his head. "Nothing sir."\n\nThree minutes passed before an aerial reconansion confirmed their worst fears; the United States had been struck with nuclear arms.\n\n"Sir." Smith approached the President, who had yet to speak since the strike. "What...what do we do?" Quiet. Silence. Finally, a sigh. "I thought Speer was a reformer. Now look where we're at. Christ. God." The President paused. "We...we have to assume the worst. We have to act like the Germans are mobilizing the rest of their arsenal. God help us..."

SPEERUSA.119.t:0 "Ban Nazi Imagery"
SPEERUSA.119.desc:0 "The news that the committee will remove all imagery tied to national socialism from the fair to be held in Boston was met with outrage in the conservative wing of the NSDAP. While the Gang of Four is pleased by this development, as they know it will greatly help the fair's success, their opponents in the government accuse them openly of "betraying Hitler's legacy" and "selling our country for a few dollars" with several high-ranking party officials and bureaucrats signing an official request to the Führer to step in and "stop this madness"\n\nAs letter of protest pile on his desk at the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer can't help but understand the plight of the protesters. The Gang of Four clearly stands for something different that what he believes in, for something different from national socialism, and this fact sometimes infuriates him: if he could solve all of Germany's problem by removing those four bastards, he would have done that ages ago! Sadly, it isn't so simple: each of them is the best of the best in what they do, and even he has to admit they all love the Vaterland in their own, flawed way, and want to see it reborn, if under a different form.\n\nSighing, he takes another letter and reads it. He would like to simply throw them into the dustbin, but doing so would only enrage his own party even more. As he takes up the pen to answer the missive, he writes the same words for the umpteenth time: "Sehr geehrter Sekretär, though I understand your displeasure, and to some extent I even share it, the greatness of the Vaterland requires small sacrifices such as these to ensure we retake our legitimate place among the world powers. I will make sure that the honour of the Reich is upheld even in distant Amerika, and that no one dares to think the everlasting sun of National Socialism is setting on our empire!

Paul von Esleben, a well-known architect and war veteran, has submitted the preliminary project for the pavilion, which was so well-liked by the Führer that he ordered for it to be immediately displayed on all official media as "the finest example of the Neue Moderne Nationalsozialistische Architektur" which, coming from Hitler's personal architect, goes much further than a mere political praise.\n\nThe building itself is a tall, cylindrical structure of steel and glass, representing the new Reich, tall and powerful, and yet transparent and modern, with four spyrals regularly intertwining symbolizing the conflict between the various souls of national socialism. At each junction, an eagle's head juts out, holding a flag with the Swastika to remember the battles fought between the contenders of the Bürgerkrieg.\n\nOf the four spirals, three interrupt roughly five meters before the top, where the last one turns from the usual color of steel to pure gold, just as Führer Speer managed to prevail over the flawed ideologies of his rivals and show how National Socialism was meant to be. Finally, the spiral reaches the top, where it flattens into a platform sustaining a golden swastika upon which stands perched Fritz Koenig's masterpiece, a massive eagle with its wings spread looking over Boston as a predator looks upon its prey.\n\nAs the entire Reich rejoices for such a display of national pride, we are sure to march towards a resounding success in Boston!"

German intentions are not clear at this time, but this appears to be a direct result of collapsed diplomatic overtures between the United States and German Reich.

Akin to the World Fairs that seem to happen few and far between these days, the Unity Fair has contained impressive displays of German architecture, science, technology, and culture in a manner that may have come off as slightly boastful or intimidating to some of the fair's attendees. But nagging in the minds of all who attended was the fact that restoring ordinary relations with the Germans could grant the United States unmitigated priority access to all of this incredible economic and human capital.\n\nAnd so, our people's reception to the Unity Fair was actually quite positive, with many of our citizens being rather impressed by what the Reich's best had to offer. Boston's mayor gave a brief speech thanking Germany for creating such a fun and exciting event, and at that point it seemed as if the Germans' ambitious diplomatic mission was not so out of reach as initially thought."

But, we have to admit that we were pleasantly surprised and entertained by a number of quality films. Not all of them were too memorable, but one drama in particular starring a renowned comedy actor named Heinz Rühmann seemed to strike a chord with its audience.\n\nPerhaps, if relations do continue to improve, there could be a strong collaboration between our film industries, which could ultimately even lead to a strengthening of cultural ties between the US and Germany.

Intended to be a grand exposition akin to the World's Fairs of decades past, the fair has instead reinforced the many negative cultural stereotypes our populace holds about Germany and its people. The site was covered head to toe in swastika-themed paraphernalia, which was a huge mistake considering that Americans do not react positively to the symbol they've learned to hate after years of German conquest and American propaganda.\n\nWhile the actual quality of the cultural and scientific displays was very impressive, the fair simply seemed to portray the Germans as humourless fanatics, which doesn't bode too well for our attempts to improve their image in the minds of the American people.

However, an olive branch is a welcome gift in these parts, and, in a changing world, the more friends Washington has, the better. The letter was well addressed and complimentary, and the trip does sound delightful. Seeing the sights of Hamburg, a true European city of tradition and grace? Surely it couldn't be too bad.\n\n"

Now, a rebellious plague sweeps the city, and its carrier is the fiery naivety of German youth.\n\nWe know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the American's arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful.
