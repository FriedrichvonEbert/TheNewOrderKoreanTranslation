 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SIBERIAN_SOVIET_DESC: "연방의 붕괴로 앙가라 강 유역의 시민들은 러시아 정부의 권위로부터 자유로워졌습니다. 진정한 사회주의적 방식으로 그들이 한 첫번째 일은 위원회를 구성하는 것이었습니다. 많은 지역 공동체들이 정부의 감독 없이 잘 작동되고 있었고, 배급제도를 축소시키면 연방 안의 다른곳에서 수입한 많은 물품들은 현지 대체품으로 대체될 수 있었습니다. 서러시아의 소련 정부 잔당들과의 접촉은 끊겼으며, 그들은 자신들의 피로 자유를 위해 투쟁하는 민병대를 형성하면서 중앙 시베리아 공화국의 '민주적'인 임시정부와 겐리흐 야고다의 압제적인 정권을 인정하기를 주저했습니다. 그래서 그들은 한때 소련의 가장 먼 곳에서부터 아나키즘 사상가들의 유입에 영향을 받아, 그들은 모든 도시와 산업 조합의 대표자가 동등한 자치 통치 기구인 시베리아 아나키즘 평의회로서의 독립을 선언했습니다.\n\n외세의 위협으로부터의 입지가 안정됨에 따라, 이야 강의 자유 공산주의 군벌인 시베리아 흑군은 평의회의 영향력이 강한 단체가 되어 군사적 아나키즘을 주요 강령으로 선언했습니다. 민병대는 자유 지대의 모든 남녀의 필수적인것이 되었으며 자유 공동체의 무장조직은 자유 공동체를 위한 자기 방어 수단일 뿐만 아니라 자유로운 이념을 해외에도 전파하는 목적으로 모였습니다.\n\n아나키즘의 이상과 모순인 것처럼 보이는 군사적 아나키즘 사회는 군대와 평의회 사이의 많은 분쟁을 없앴습니다, 그렇지만 많은 평민들은 시베리아 공동체의 독립 수호자들인 흑군의 야망이 결국 평민들의 자유의 후퇴가 될까봐 두려워합니다."
 
 POLITICS_KHAKASSIA_SECURITY_COUNCIL_DESC: "어머니 아나키의 시작과 지속에 의한 충격만큼이나 방위 위원회가 시베리아 정치의 결정적인 힘으로 부상한 것은 많으면서도 적은 이들에게 충격으로 다가왔습니다. 국제 관측통들은 소외된 총회의 의미를 곰곰이 생각하고 있는 반면, 권력을 가진 흑군의 지휘 아래 있는 사람들은 그들 앞에 더 어려운 난제를 겪고 있는데, 바로 그들이 여전히 자유롭다고 부를 수 있는가에 대한 문제입니다.\n\n중앙 시베리아에서 제공하는 가장 영향력 있고 재능 있는 장교들로 구성된 자유 지구는 당초 목표에서 벗어나 항로를 변경했습니다. 한때는 평생 폭정의 군홧발 밑에서 살아온 고통을 본 사람들이 모여 영겁의 시간동안 인류를 괴롭혔던 억압적인 체제에 대항하는 단결된 투쟁이었던 것이 이반 스테파노프 장군의 계략에 의해 변화되고 기형적으로 변질된 것입니다.\n\n스테파노프의 명성은 중앙 시베리아 공화국이 붕괴하는 동안 나타났습니다. 야고다 국가의 심장부로 진격해 들어가는 임무를 맡은 사단장이었던 장군은 의회에서 정치꾼들이 내리는 명령에 의해 더 많은 러시아인들이 더 많은 러시아인들을 죽이기 위해 행진하는 무의미함을 보았습니다. 힘 있는 웅변가이자 노조 지도자 표트르 시우다와의 즉흥적인 협상에서 스테파노프는 폭정과 권위에 대항하여 그의 사단을 규합했고 시우다는 그 운동의 대중적 지지를 확보했습니다.\n\n이반 스테파노프의 정상에 오르기위한 여정은 오랜 시간이 걸렸지만, 총회가 무력화되면서, 이제 장군이 해야할 일은 명확해졌습니다. 그가 항상 해왔던 일을 하는 것, 좋은 공연을 해내는 것입니다."
 
 POLITICS_MONGUSH_BUYAN_BADYRGY_DESC: "The former Chairman of the Council of Ministers and presumed successor to Donduk Kuular in the old Tuvan People's Republic, Mongush Buyan-Badyrgy leads a people that have long been neglected and forgotten. Enduring through the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva emerged as an independent state, sending what little aid they could to the Mongolian People's Republic to hold off the imperialist Japanese forces. Yet in spite of the efforts of the Tuvan and Mongolian people, Ulaanbaatar fell to the invaders, and many in Kuular's government feared Kyzyl would be next.\n\nSo, when Red Army forces arrived in Tuva, this was received as nothing short of a blessing. The request that the Tuvan People's Republic would become subordinate to the Red Army command was an insignificant price to pay in return for a chance to stave off Japan.\n\nAfter Kuular's death, Buyan-Badyrgy became the new head of the Tuvan government under the People's Revolutionary Council. And when Red Army forces capitulated to the Black Army invading from the north, he was allowed to walk free due to his popularity with the Tuvan people. For a time Buyan-Badyrgy remained content with this; little had changed other than the banner of the army protecting them. Yet once again chaos erupted in the war-torn region as various communes in the north of the Free Territory declared their secession, and had led to the arrival of Ivan Stepanov's forces.\n\nNow a new army had arrived in Tuva, for much the same reasons as the last. This army, however, they had no desire for cooperation with the Tuvan people; they organized conscription, diverted production and set up defences, dragging Tuva into more needless conflict. Buyan-Badyrgy could not stand idly by through this, and so, rallying former members of the Tuvan army and government, alongside Altaic partisans, he led a revolt against the Black Army's rule. Once more Tuva must fight against overwhelming forces, yet having overcome such odds before, Buyan-Badyrgy knows Tuva will prevail again."
 POLITICS_REGIONAL_COUNCILS_DESC: "Anarchy - the ideal that had liberated Central Siberia from the shackles of authoritarianism, warlordism and elitism, has fallen. When the communes of Krasnoyarsk declared their independence and returned to the darkness that had consumed the region months prior, the communes of northern Siberia found themselves cut off from the General Assembly's guidance. Panic rose as the loss of an agreed-upon inter-communal body left them divided and undirected.\n\nYet days passed, which became weeks and then months, and the communes of north Siberia remained. The fear of invasion from the new warlords to the south did not come to fruition, the prospect of a famine arising from a lack of coordination between communes, too, never came to pass. Although undoubtedly facing hardships, the decentralised communes of the North Siberian Soviets have survived, now separate from all authority.\n\nWhile this extreme decentralisation makes the fielding of an army, coordination in development and any form of decisive action near impossible, the communes of Norilsk, Kolpashevo and their many rural comrades persist. The General Assembly, previously seen as vital to the coordination of the Free Territory, is now seen as an obsolete organization, one which impeded the people of Siberia from realising true anarchism.\n\nThough in the harsh lands of Russia, with warlords to the south and centralized states forming to the east and west, can such a system truly survive?"
 POLITICS_IVAN_STEPANOV_DESC: "If there were to be one upside to the collapse of the Soviet Union, it would undoubtedly be the wide assortment of characters, heroes and villains alike, with wildly different motivations, dreams, and goals able to reforge the nation in their own vision. What warlord could claim to be as visionary as the Free Territory? The struggle for anarchism didn't always have to be a dream. There exists a world where Siuda and his faction are triumphant, a world where anarchism is finally allowed a chance to prove itself, a world where all people may one day be free, a world without Ivan Georgievich Stepanov.\n\nWhat sets Stepanov apart from Leninist mutineers and Rurikids monarchs is not that he is without vision or purpose, in that regard he isn't much different from Siuda himself. One could easily claim that Stepanov's vision is grander than Siuda's or any other warlord scattered across shattered Russia. Slowly building a hidden hierarchy in the Free Territory that revolves entirely around him, Stepanov pioneered the Security Council, a body able to override the General Assembly in the name of territorial integrity. At the time, the Security Council was an absolute necessity, forcing even the most passionate ideologues to begrudgingly accept the body's role in the Free Territory. However, as the Free Territory subsumed more and more, people began to question why the council was still necessary.\n\nWell? Why was it? To the safety of the Free Territory, it was no longer necessary. To finalize Stepanov's goals, the Security Council was everything, the only way for him to exercise control. And, for Ivan Stepanov, that's what it's always been about; control. For the longest time, Stepanov has been willing to bide his time, to wait until he was the focal point in which the Free Territory revolves around. But he's waited for more than two decades now, putting up with the nonsensical whims of people whose ideology he doesn't understand and doesn't care to. Many opportunities have presented themselves to Stepanov and he's let them slip right through his fingers. Now, in the chaos of anarchy, Stepanov will grab that opportunity tight, strangle it, and never let go."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_ASTAFYEV: "Krasnoyarsk was a state founded on promises. Promises of freedom, promises of greatness, promises of prosperity for decades to come. Where are all those promises now?\n\nComrade Siuda made many promises upon the Black Army's entry into Krasnoyarsk as well. Promises of liberation, promises of emancipation, and promises of equality for all. For a time, in the days and weeks following the collapse of Andreev's fiefdom, these promises were made good upon. The Black Army expelled the city's oppressors while representatives of the General Assembly established a local assembly in conjunction with the Social Democratic Party. It was in the overcrowded, unkept, and musty cafeteria of the Siberian Technical Institute of Forest that Viktor Petrovich Astafyev first got a taste for anarchism. Those sent to aid in the reorganization of structure in the city did well at adjusting a moderate democrat such as Astafyev to the new lifestyle awaiting him and the other inhabitants of the city. Emerging as a communal leader, Astafyev met with Siuda and Taratuta on multiple occasions. Viktor's close association with Siuda and high-ranking members of the General Assembly made his betrayal all the worse.\n\nAstafyev pondered if this was truly anarchism as his city became home to the headquarters of the Black Army. Astafyev's requests for increased civilian governance fell on deaf ears as quotas were delivered from Kilchichakov, Mishurenko established a permanent residence in the city alongside his large following of soldiers, and Stepanov cast down veto after veto on local motions.\n\nSiuda truly is no different than Andreev, and Astafyev and the people of Russia are far past empty promises. Though Siuda and the General Assembly have made multiple requests for Krasynoarsk to return to the fold, Siuda is not free of sin. In the mind of Viktor Nekrasov, associating with tyrants makes one no better, and tyrants have no place in a free Russia."
 POLITICS_YURIY_KRYLOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Yuriy Nikolayevich Krylov is a man trapped in a storybook. At least, it's been easier for him to view his life as a story being told rather than a life being lived. The author of the tragedy has seen fit that Yuriy be a protagonist, a prince presiding over a troubled land.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young boy. He was a noble, but lived as one amongst the citizens of the flourishing kingdom. One day, while the young boy read by the river, an evil wizard came to his kingdom, hexing all those around him to be slaves, unrelenting in service to their master. The wizard's tricks did not affect the royal family. The king and his guard fought gallantly to repel the wizard, but the wizard and his knight overwhelmed the kingdom, taking the king prisoner and leaving the hero's sister slain in battle.\n\nSpared by the forces of the wizard under the protection of his subjects, Yuriy assumed a new identity, renouncing his titles. Still, the hero worked tirelessly to enhance the lives of his people, subverting the wizard's puppet administration. For a time, it seemed as though the wizard's empire was invincible, until a rift opened up between the wizard and the knight. The knight began to assert himself as the hegemon of the region, using whatever means necessary to secure a kingdom of his own. The brutal methods of the knight and the waning influence of the wizard provided an opportunity to strike, as the prophecy had foretold.\n\nThe hero, having assumed the name and title of King Rurik III, rallied his most loyal supporters to break free of the wizard's brainwashing and to live in freedom once more. While the hero of prophecy recuperates his forces, the mad general of the south continues his raids. The story of King Rurik III is far from over. The battle of prophecy will soon commence and the people can finally live...\n\n§G...Happily ever after.§!"
 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "What place does a conservative businessman have in Russia? In the days of the empire, he would find his virgining enterprise quashed by the backwardness of the Tsar. In the days of the Union, he would find his owings confiscated at best and his life too at worst. Now, in the days of the Russian anarchy, more than ever, what place is there for a conservative businessman?\n\nDespite his grievances with Pokryshkin and the unapologetic kleptocrats of the federation, the fall of Novosibirsk and, more importantly to him, Barnaul, left Shukshin in a severe state of depression. The chaos and confusion of the days and weeks following the capitulation of the federation scattered many of Russia's best and brightest into the wind. Pokryshkin; missing and presumed dead. The chief officers of the mega corporations; executed or imprisoned. Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was all that remained of the capitalist establishment. Forced into a life of reclusion after his popularity with the citizenry spared him from punishment, Shukshin spent his days drinking in the solitude of his home. Truly, people reach their lowest points when excluded from the majority and under the tyranny of the General Assembly, the majority was never so powerful and Shukshin was never so weak..That was, until one day, Shukshin received a letter.\n\nA former high ranking member of the Barnaul city council expressed the raising discontent in the city. The letter was clear in goal, even if the language hid the fact, the cracks in the anarchist foundation had begun to show and the people yearned for the promise of the federation. Shukshin became a man rejuvenated, his optimism and sense of purpose restored. The schism in the anarchist movement proves only one thing, anarchism doesn't work. Unlike the splintered anarchist movement, Shukshin has a job to do, and he'll be damned if the anarchists get the better of him twice."
 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Can one person change the world? Sure. A Romanov, a businessman, a scholar, people of class, all can bend the world to their whims. But can a slave? Can a simple worker take the reins of oppression and break them without a Lenin? Vitaly Semyonovich Kostin doesn't really know, and, in all honesty, he hoped he would never have to find out.\n\nNothing more than a construction engineer in Novosibirsk, Kostin quickly became one of the most ardent supporters of the Free Territory and their liberationist message. Present at the liberation of the city, Kostin proved an effective organizer and orator, with his simple populist message resonating with his fellow workers. The strike fostered by Kostin proved instrumental in the Free Territory's campaign against the Siberian Falcon. Following the establishment of an assembly in Novosibirsk, Kostin, a man of humble origins, sought to return to his modest life of work, content to leave the fate of Russia to the capable hands of Comrade Siuda. But it was not Siuda who laid claim to the city first.\n\nIn the weeks following the campaign, one name became more common than that of Pokryshkin; Ivan Stepanov. They began as whispers, rumors of a powerful lackey to Siuda who formed the muscle of their duo. Word spread quickly, but it was the seemingly unendingly increasing number of Black Army soldiers present at factories and demonstrations that made it clear something was amiss. Strict quotas, political repression, and rampant corruption left many residents of the city scratching their heads, wondering what changed. The blatant repression of the working people became so severe it forced one man out of retirement.\n\nBetrayed by the capitalists of Novosibirsk and once more by the anarchists of Kansk, Kostin embodies the heart and soul of the Russian people; tired. How many revolts must occur? How many times must the people be lied to? Kostin doesn't know all the answers, he doesn't know much at all, but he does know that oppression in any form must be stamped out, no matter if it hides behind the skull and crossbones or not."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_NEKRASOV_DESC: "Disillusioned with the tyranny of Chairman Yagoda and at odds with the corporate capitalists of Novosibirsk, Viktor Platonovich Nekrasov found himself most closely aligned with Shostakovich and the Humanist salon in Tomsk. Despite this, Nekrasov could never find his footing with the more radical social democrats and moderate socialists. Nekrasov felt lost. His ideology was much to the left of prominent humanists yet still to the right of the anarchist movement cultivating to the south. Without a movement to call home, Nekrasov resigned himself to a life of writing, a passion he had picked up after settling in the intellectual heart of Russia. Nekrasov took an interest in journalism. His lack of ideological alignment may have left him isolated but granted him an exceptional career as a war correspondent, covering the movements of warlords across Central Siberia and to the east. It was the Black Army that garnered the most attention from him.\n\nIf his attention was not captured by the expansion of the Free Territory, its leaders marching down the streets of Tomsk most certainly did. While his views didn't line up with Siudaist thought one to one, he had little complaints in the following the liberation of the city. The abolishment of the salon system offered him more say than previously, and the Territory's aversion to authoritarianism was certainly appreciated. As days and weeks went by, however, it seemed as though the conflict in Tomsk never ceased. Anarchist splinter groups loyal to different factions and philosophies battled openly in the streets prompting larger quantities of Black Army detachments to police the city.\n\nAs the conflict swelled, Nekrasov felt a divide grow in him as well. If history were to continue, if scholars and scribes could still find work in a cutthroat era of utilitarianism, the march on Tomsk would go down as the most significant workers strike of a generation and Viktor Nekrasov wouldn't be where he was. However, fate is often unkind, and those with the best intentions often find themselves on the wrong side of history."

 SBA_intro_assemble_the_communal_representatives_desc: "시베리아 흑군 총회는 우리가 해방시킨 아나키즘 공동체와 모든 공동체의 정책 조율을 목표로, 우리의 탄생 첫해에 만들어진 기관 중 하나였습니다. 정기적으로 소집되어 일상적인 문제를 다루는 경우가 많지만, 자유구역의 완벽한 작동엔 여전히 중요합니다.\n\n시간이 흐를수록, 우리는 이 혼란스럽고 불안정한 환경에서 계속 생존하고 있으며, 우리가 방심하지 않고 아나키의 이상을 유지한다는 사실과 많은 관련이 있습니다. 이를 위해 우리는 또한 내부에서의 협력을 추구해야하며, 총회는 우리 영토의 문제를 공개적이고 투명하게 논의함으로써 우리에게 그 일을 할 수 있는 탁월한 방법을 제공합니다."
 SBA_intro_assemble_the_security_council_desc: "시베리아 흑군은 러시아 인민의 진정한 자유를 옹호하지만, 현재 우리가 처해있는 상황에서 군대의 조직적 보호가 필요없다고 주장하는 것은 터무니 없는 거짓말일 것입니다. 그래서 우리는 인민들이 지지하는 군사적 아나키즘 체제를 채택했습니다. 이 체제에 중요한 것은 흑군에 충성하는 모든 민병대의 지휘관들로 구성된 안전 보장 위원회입니다. 물론, 이 지휘관들은 모두 군인들이 스스로 뽑은 것이고, 이렇게 함으로써 우리는 그들이 우리의 목소리와 이익을 대변한다고 확신할 수 있습니다. 안전 보장 위원회의 또 다른 회의는 우리가 최근의 모든 안보문제를 언급하고 해결하는데 도움을 줄 것입니다."

 SBA_intro_present_elected_officer_candidates_desc: "원조 혁명반역군와 진정한 아나키스트들의 신념을 따르는 시베리아 흑군의 또 다른 자랑스러운 전통은 모든 장교단의 민주적인 선거입니다. 전통적이고 독재적인 지휘구조를 맹목적으로 지키는 대신, 국민이 국민을 보호하기 위해 만든 모든 육군 사령관들은 민주적으로 선출됩니다. 군인 회의는 그 과정을 수행하는 역할에 권한이 있으며, 더 나아가 모든 장교들은 언제든지 소환될 수 있습니다. 우리는 수년에 걸쳐 이 체제를 완벽히 완성하는데 성공했는데, 이는 유능한 사람들이 부대의 선택을 받아 정상에 오르는것에 초점을 뒀습니다.\n\n제 3차 칸스크 총회가 진행됨에 따라 우리는 군대와 그 지휘부에 있는 사람들의 현상태를 보여줘야합니다. 따라서 군인회의에서 선출된 사람들은 총회에 출석하여 공동대표들에게 제안하고 그 밖의 사항을 논의합니다."
 SBA_intro_present_revolutionary_security_reports_desc: "자유구역의 군대는 해방된 우리 땅을 지키는 중추적인 역할을 하고 있는데, 그들이 아니였다면 우리는 결코 사슬을 끊어내지 못했을 것이고, 우리는 여전히 야고다의 압제적인 제국 또는 중앙 시베리아 '민주' 국가의 통치하에 있을 것입니다. 그러나 모든 부대의 기능과 동작들의 보증하는 것을 동기화되고 조화를 이루도록 하는 것은 엄청나게 어려운 작업입니다. 그러한 이유로, 우리 영토 전역의 상황들을 개략적으로 설명하고, 공동체를 위험으로부터 구제하고 방어하기 위한 노력을 조정하는데 도움을 주는 "보안 보고서"가 필요합니다. 제 3차 칸스크 총회가 열리는 상황에서 보안 보고서는 중앙 시베리아의 큰 그림과 그것이 아나키스트 공동체에 미치는 영향을 보여주기 때문에 중요합니다. 러시아 군벌주의의 혼란 속에서 우리가 직면한 위협에 대처하는 단결력은 매우 중요합니다."
 SBA_intro_present_local_developmental_reports_desc: "칸스크 총회에서 수많은 공동대표들에게 우리 실험의 성공을 보여주려면, 프로젝트의 성과와 모든 정착지의 자치권들을 보여줘야 합니다. 모든 마을이 국가 당국으로부터가 아나라 단지 아나키 상태의 원리를 통해 도움을 받아 지역 주민들이 자유롭게 그들의 터전을 개발할 수 있도록 했다는 것은 분명합니다. 우리는 전문가들로 하여금 총회의 개발 도상 지역사회에 대한 그들의 연구 결과와 보고서를 발표하게 함으로써 이것을 강조할 필요가 있습니다. 이런 식으로, 우리는 또한 고집스러운 대표들에게 우리 체제의 효과에 대해 설득시킬 것입니다."

 SBA_second_the_red_mantle_desc: "시베리아 계획은 독소전에 산업적으로 대비하기 위해 전선에서 떨어진 곳에서 시작한 대규모 산업 계획이었습니다. 결국 전쟁에서는 패했지만, 그 기간 동안 건설한 산업은 그 어느 누구도 예상했던거보다 훨씬 능가하도록 소련을 밀었습니다. 아이러니하게도, 시베리아 소비에트의 영토는 이 계획의 핵심 지역이 아니었고, 따라서 우리의 산업 능력은 이웃 나라들에 비해 낮습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 우리가 지금 이용할 수 있는 산업은 우리가 확장할 수 있는 견고한 기반을 제공할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_peoples_survey_desc: "코뮌 경제에서 자원을 적절하게 할당하기 위해서는, 어떤 지역이 산업 개발에 적합한지 혹은 자원 추출에 적합한지 그것도 아니면 농업 개발에 적합한지 아는 것이 중요합니다. 게다가 군벌들 사이의 경계는 종종 불확실하고 바뀌기 마련입니다. 토지 조사를 통해 우리는 정확히 어떤 영토가 우리 땅인지, 그리고 전쟁이 발발했을 때 어떤 영토를 방어하는 것이 가치 있거나 전략적인지를 알 수 있을 것이다. 이를 위해 코뮌들은 이웃 코뮌들과 협력하여 자발적으로 토지를 측량하는 '인민 설문 조사'에 참여하도록 요청받을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_industrial_data_consolidation_desc: "우리의 독특한 분산형 정부 형태로 인해, 각 코뮌이 이용 할 수 있는 산업적 기계의 품질과 양은 종종 코뮌 스스로가 무엇을 생산할 수 있는지에 따라 결정됩니다. 이로 인해 지역사회 간 산업력 격차가 크게 벌어졌고, 일부 지역사회는 그들의 필요에 맞춰서 생산을 할 수 없게 되었습니다. 여러 공동체에서 제공하는 산업 정보를 조합한 결과, 생산 능력에 대한 투자를 통해 자신의 효용을 얻을 수 있는 여러 공동체들을 확인하게 되었습니다."
 SBA_second_begin_the_redistribution_desc: "우리가 시베리아 소비에트 연방을 처음 설립했을 때 시작한 토지 개혁은 아직도 끝나지 않았습니다. 단순히 시베리아 전쟁에서 살아남는 것에 초점을 맞춰서 우리의 시간과 노력의 대부분을 소비했기 때문이죠. 이러한 문제들이 해결되었기 때문에, 우리는 각 공동체의 요구에 따라 토지를 재분배하는 것을 재개 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 우리가 이 문제를 해결 하는데 실패한 것 주된 이유는, 일부 코뮌이 그들의 규모와 인력을 남용하여 다른 코뮌들의 필요로 하는 땅에서 몰아내도록 만들었기 때문입니다. 이 토지 개혁 계획은 보다 공정하고 공평한 방법으로 코뮌간 경계을 재정비하는 방안을 모색할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_repair_the_transsib_desc: "구 차르정의 몇 안 되는 성공 가운데는 시베리아 횡단 철도 건설이 있었습니다. 그 철도는 러시아에 큰 영향을 끼쳐, 그 나라를 이전에는 보지 못했던 방식으로 묶었죠. 부하린 정권 동안 광범위하게 사용되었고, 2차 세계대전 이후 1950년대 소련-독일 전쟁에서 소련의 중요한 동맥이 되었다. 우리가 전쟁에서 패한 후, 독일 폭격기들은 철도를 거의 완전히 파괴했습니다. 하지만, 독일 폭격기들은 러시아 상공에서 멀리 떨어져 있기 때문에, 우리는 국경 내에서 운행되는 철도의 일부를 수리할 수 있고, 이전의 영광 중 일부를 다시 되돌릴 수도 있을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_continue_regional_interconnection_desc: "기반 시설의 개발은 항상 우리가 해야할 중요한 일 중 하나입니다. 그것은 나라 전체의 자원 흐름을 개선할 뿐만 아니라, 경제적으로나 정치적으로 코뮌들을 더욱 가깝게 합니다. 코뮌 간 유대는 시베리아 소비에트 연방의 범위를 넓힐 때 시험 받을 수 있고, 그렇기 때문에 우리가 그런 유대를 강화시키는 모든 일들은 매우 중요합니다. 이를 위해, 우리는 시베리아 소비에트 전역을 여행했고, 우리를 가장 고립된 공동체와도 연결할 수 있는 도로 체제을 구축하는데 투자할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_return_to_the_mines_desc: "정상적인 경제 기능이 회복되고, 추가로 공공 재건 계획 형태로 좋게 경제를 자극하면서, 경제는 빠른 속도로 성장하기 시작했습니다. 광물 자원에 대한 수요는 거의 10배 증가했지만, 많은 코뮌들이 이를 제공할 준비가 되어 있지 않는거 같습니다. 독일 폭격기들이 큰 규모의 채굴 광산들을 파괴한다는 위협이 사라지면서, 지금은 이전에 폐쇄되었던 광산을 다시 열기에 좋은 시기인 것 같다. 게다가, 우리는 새로운 광산 장비를 제조하고 광업에 쉽게 접근 가능한 코뮌에 그 장비들을 배포할 시기입니다."
 SBA_second_dedicated_agricultural_production_desc: "우리의 코뮌들은 날이 갈수록 더 커지고 있습니다. 우리의 코뮌들이 매일 한 가정들에게 제공하는 영양과 경제적 안정은 출산률에 뚜렷한 영향을 끼치고 있습니다. 이 점을 염두에 두고, 우리의 농업 생산량을 늘리는 것이 옳아보입니다. 결론부터 말하면, 기계화된 농업 장비를 농업 생산량을 높히기 위해 생산하고 코뮌에 분배되어야 합니다. 이것은 우리의 농부들이 더 많은 생산품을 생산하는데 도움을 줄 뿐만 아니라, 우리 노동자들이 다른 일을 할 수 있는 자유 시간도 줄 것이다."
 SBA_second_rural_production_nodes_desc: "아나키즘 사회의 핵심은 도시나 교외에 있는 것이 아니라 시골 마을과 그 안에 있는 지역 사회에 있습니다. 이러한 공동체들이 도시의 제조품에 대한 의존을 끝내도록 돕는 것은 우리의 중요한 목표입니다. 따라서, 우리는 코뮌 스스로 생산품을 생산할 수 있도록 지역 작업장의 개발을 장려할 것입니다. 또한 이러한 코뮌을 통해 공동체들은 칼라시니코프의 총기장 같은 것이 바로 뒷마당에 있기 때문에 더욱 쉽게 무장할 수 있을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_foundation_laid_desc: "많은 사람들이 불가능하다고 생각하는 아나키즘 실험을, 우리는 반박하며 우리의 이데올로기가 우월하다는 것을 몇 번이고 계속 증명하고 있습니다. 우리의 도덕성을 손상시키지 않고, 우리는 생산수단을 통제하는 소수의 특권층없이, 모든 사람들에게 이익을 주는 경제체제를 만들 수 있었습니다. 우리는 모든 러시아 인민들을 위한 경제적 기반을 다진 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_grey_area_desc: "완벽한 이 세계에서는, 부유한 부자들이 선호하는 국가와, 그들을 지배하는 부패하고 불공정한 국가에 대한 인민들의 대답으로써, 아나키즘 사회가 자연스럽게 생겨날 것입니다. 그러나 현 상태를 보면, 인민들이 당초 예상보다 그들의 국가에 더 애착을 가지고 있는 것처럼 보이고, 그러한 인민들이 사는 많은 국가들은 우리의 존재 자체를 문제 삼고 있습니다. 개개 코뮌들은 이들의 침략을 물리칠 수 없기 때문에 우리가 살아남으려면 중앙집권적인 군대가 필요합니다. 그러나 그런 기구들은 아나키즘의 근본과 모순되지 않나요? 게다가, 얼마나 민주적인지에 상관없이 모든 코뮌들을 지배하는 중앙 평의회는 아나키즘의 이상에도 반대하지 않나요? 우리의 이념적 핵심을 배반 했다고 할 수준으로 우리의 뿌리로부터 멀어지려면 어느정도 멀어져야 할까요? 중앙정부가 아닌 코뮌들과 개인에게 어디까지 그 권리가 허용되어야 하는지 정확히 짚고 넘어가야 할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_delegate_industrial_administration_desc: "공산주의의 핵심은 생산수단을 인민에게 돌려주는 것이 목표인 이념입니다. 중앙집권적인 정부에게 경제를 통제하게 하는 것은 이 목표와 완전히 모순됩니다. 따라서 우리 경제의 효율성을 향상시키기 위해서는, 우리는 대신 몇몇 공동체로부터 산업 평의회를 만들어, 가능한 산업적 개선과 투자 할만한 지역의 목록을 만들고, 그 목록을 각 코뮌의 지방 평의회에 제출하여 검토해야 합니다. 그리고 산업 평의회는 또한 소외된 코뮌들에서 산업 건설 계획을할 수 있도록 정해진 양의 자본을 배정받게 될 것입니다."

However, our work does not stop here, as there is much to be done. Firstly and most importantly, many new villages, towns, and even cities have come under our control, and we must work to help organize all of our new lands into proper communes. Furthermore, we must begin the long process of helping the people acclimate and understand why anarchism is the proper future of Russia.\n\nLurking and mostly unspoken is the fear that the Siberian Soviet will be subsumed by the Black Army, leading to the anarchist dream falling into the trappings of a military junta. While some of these fears may have merit, we can hopefully find a solution that allows for us to maintain freedom while preventing chaos!"
 SBA_regional_consolidate_the_regional_courts_desc: "The new territories under our control have to be consolidated and reformed into proper anarchist communes. The solution, at first glance, is to simply let the people organize themselves into communes. However, while this may seem simply easy on paper, the actual process over this reformation has caused quite the ideological debate. The people of Central Siberia have never lived under an anarchist society, and likely have no idea how to organize themselves. Furthermore, it is also likely that there are too many who still wish to see our dream foiled. Therefore, we are left with a choice. Do we allow the people to self-organize, as our ideology tells us to, or do we have the Black Army provisionally lead these lands until they are ready to properly organize?"
 SBA_regional_instate_provisional_leadership_desc: "Despite our hopes otherwise, the leaders of the SIberian Soviet know the truth. Too many of the people in the newly conquered lands are opposed to anarchism as of right now, and letting the people self-organize would only invite sabotage. While it might sting, we have no choice but to let the Black Army provisionally lead the new lands until we can be certain that the people are ready to self-organize. It may seem contradictory, but we have to do this for the sake of the revolution. With luck, the people will acclimate to anarchism quickly and control can be handed over properly to the future anarchist communes, preventing the authority of the Black Army from becoming too entrenched."
 SBA_regional_faith_in_the_newly_integrated_desc: "To let the Black Army control our new lands would be nothing but an absolute betrayal of our ideology! It may seem inane, but allowing the Black Army to control our new lands sets a bad precedent. After all, if we expand farther, why shouldn't the Black Army control those new lands until the people are acclimated to anarchism? In any case, showing that we don't trust the people undermines anarchism here in Siberia as a whole. After all, one of the major tenets of anarchism is mutual cooperation, and failing to extend a hand in trust does nothing but sabotage our hopes from the very beginning! There may be those who are unwilling to self-organize, but through proper execution of anarchist ideology as compared to throwing the army around like a fascist state, we can forge an anarchist society that is truly free!"
 SBA_regional_strike_the_balance_of_power_desc: "The Black Army is undeniably a powerful authority, and we've had to rely greatly upon them throughout all of our struggles and expansion. Such a reliance is worrying to many, and the fears of the Black Army eventually forming a military junta in all but name are widespread. Of course, we cannot allow such a tragedy to occur, especially after coming so far. To prevent the Black Army from controlling too much power, we must take efforts to reinforce the soviets and communes. Strengthening the civilian councils, combined with transferring Black Army tasks to other, more representative organs will allow us to maintain our anarchist ideals even in the fact of threats!"
 SBA_regional_extend_the_communication_systems_desc: "One of the biggest issues that we have encountered in our expansion is a lack of communication ability. It can take days, even weeks to find out about various events that occur in the more rural areas. Furthermore, the need for better communication and coordination with our rural comrades is critical in this time of reorganization, as access to superior resources and ending any lurking threats are matters of the utmost importance. This communication expansion will be done by extending telegraph lines, building new radio towers, and constructing a modern phone system, allowing us to reach even the most isolated of communities. No longer will we be left in the dark when it comes to rural matters!"
 SBA_regional_correct_the_misguided_teachings_desc: "Education is undoubtedly the foundation of our future. After all, it is education that instills values in the youth, and it is education that people refer back to throughout their life. While there are aspects of the old Soviet and CSR teaching that were taught correctly and properly, there are many other aspects that must be retaught to the populace in order for them to become model anarchists. Most importantly, we must highlight the failures of the states to bring long-term stability and peace to central Siberia, and similarly showcase how anarchist thought will succeed where the puppet democracy and statist thought has failed. It may take time, but the people will finally understand the truth of anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_cast_down_social_injustice_desc: "Throughout the centuries, the Russian states in whatever form they may have taken have created a culture of inequality. Women are, more often than not, seen as inferior to men, and consigned to be housewives. People of other races have faced similar criticism, being viewed with suspicion for no other reason than prejudice. However, the group who has had it the worst of all are homosexuals. They barely have even a right to exist, with many having persecuted those unlucky enough to be revealed. Such prejudices have no place in an anarchist society. We must work to break the chains that shackle our women, show people that race is merely appearance and nothing more, and allow our homosexual comrades to finally be able to freely love whomever they want!"
 SBA_regional_enshrine_the_material_rights_desc: "Every human, no matter what, deserves the right to live. Of course, one cannot merely just live. People require material resources such as food and water. In order to ensure that we truly uphold the right of everyone to live, we must also ensure that everyone, no matter who they are, has access to the necessities of life. In order to ensure this, we must help ensure that the communes are always able to provide whatever is necessary for people to live. Obviously, we will inform the communes of their duty, but we will also remind them that they have access to aid from the greater communes if need be. We will ensure that life is able to prosper under anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_establish_the_provisional_resource_council_desc: "With our access to new lands and resources, many comrades have pointed out a need to properly coordinate said resources so that the communes can properly function. To this end, we shall establish the Provisional Resource Council. This Council's main function will be ensuring the extraction and distribution of all resources within the Free Territory. To this end, the Council will be composed of workers from resource-gathering industries and representatives from areas who need resources. This Council will hopefully be able to solve any and all needs from the cities and villages involving resource needs, while allowing the workers who produce said resources a place to be heard."
 SBA_regional_the_last_congress_of_kansk_desc: "With the rapid growth of new lands for the Free Territory, it has become clear that a more central location is needed in order for the communes to properly coordinate. However, there are a few issues that still need to be worked out, and we must make sure that the movement of the communal congress to a more central city like Novosibirsk is done officially, through democratic vote. Therefore, we shall hold one final Congress in Kansk, to solve any remaining internal issues, before moving to Novosibirsk!"
 SBA_regional_rectify_the_rural_urban_split_desc: "The first major issue that the Congress of Kansk has chosen to focus on is the urban-rural split. While most of our rural comrades have been able to begin reorganizing the villages into proper anarchist communes, our urban comrades have had difficulties. The large population of the cities combined with the high concentration of people has led to efforts requiring more intensive care and resources in order to succeed. With the consolidation of some of the other new communes, we can afford to devote more time and effort into properly reorganizing the cities. These communal governments, more than anything, will set the model for any future communes. We must try our hardest to truly liberate all of the people who live in the Free Territory and show them the light of anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_honors_for_humanity_desc: "When the Soviet Union fell and the Central SIberian Republic splintered, the people were left adrift, with lawlessness plaguing the land. To deal with the chaos, many people turned to religion, leading to the church becoming a very powerful influence in Central Siberia. While we have no interest in outright banning the church, we must take steps to curb its influence on our populace. We must take efforts to educate the populace about secularism and inspire their hopes in the communes, lessening their dependence on the church for stability. We shall also utilize the church wealth that we have been able to obtain for our own purposes instead of returning it to the church. Such efforts may seem controversial to some of our comrades, but it is necessary to help forge a better society!"
 SBA_regional_present_the_cure_desc: "When the Tsar was deposed, the people turned to another government in the form of the USSR. When the USSR fell, the people turned to yet another government in the CSR. Yet in the end, the CSR fell, like the two governments before it. These states were unable to deal with the problems that plagued Russia, and so they collapsed. However, where statism has failed, anarchism has succeeded! Indeed, in a short period of time, Central Siberia has soared by leaps and bounds! Indeed, it seems that Russia has fallen ill, and anarchism is the obvious cure to its woes! We owe it to be the stalwart doctors that ensure that the cure is properly administered!"
 SBA_regional_liberty_all_encompassing_and_eternal_desc: "With all major issues settled, the last Congress at Kansk has begun to wind down. All major internal issues seem to have been settled, with the creation of communes and councils proceeding smoothly. The Congress shall conclude with the formal vote to have all future meetings be based in Novosibirsk. Against all odds, the Free Territory has not only been able to expand, but prosper and spread anarchism all across Central Siberia! We fought in Ukraine, we fought in Catalonia, and finally, here in Central Siberia, we have succeeded. Freedom has been brought to the people, and a new dawn approaches for the Free Territory. A new dawn in which we are all able to enjoy the fruits of liberty!"
 SBA_regional_develop_the_free_territory_desc: "Our territory was never a major focus for the former Soviet government. While we did receive investment in the form of an expanded Trans-Siberian Railroad and some upgraded machinery for our urban centers, the Soviet Union simply didn't have the time or resources to invest into our home like it did in other regions. This wasn't always meant to be the case, however. The Siberian Plan would have included increased development of our civilian infrastructure, an expansion of the cities, and major investments into our military industrial plants. There would have been almost complete vertical integration of our military industry, from the extraction of unrefined iron in the ground all the way to the manufacture and distribution of Kalashnikovs. While this plan was unfeasible at the time, given our newfound resources, these plans can finally be realized."
 SBA_regional_integrate_the_urban_economies_desc: "Urban areas have always been somewhat difficult to integrate into the communal economy that we practice. Unable to provide food for themselves, oftentimes cities would be able to trade weapons produced in the city for food in the adjacent towns. With the development of localized production of guns in town centers now, this economic balance has been thrown off. In order to compensate for this lost revenue stream for the cities, we must encourage the cities to better utilize their resources, namely their larger skill pool and additional manpower, to produce more specialized items and civilian goods that they can use to continue bringing capital and food into the cities."
 SBA_regional_rebuild_urban_infrastructure_desc: "Though central Siberia was spared from the wrath of the German bombers that plagued the lands further west, its cities have not escaped damage entirely. The collapse of the Central Siberian Republic, and the subsequent wars fought to liberate the region have left the infrastructure of urban centres in dire need of repair. Thankfully, with peace finally brought to Siberia, and the newly-established communes more than willing to begin rebuilding, the task should be easily completed."
 SBA_regional_re_organize_the_industrial_centers_desc: "At its heart, communism is about the community above all else, and the idea that everyone can contribute to a common good. Such an ideal of community is easy to develop in tight knit villages or town communities, but far more difficult in large cities. We must endeavor to promote a feeling of solidarity and brotherhood among citizens living in these cities. Such community begins in the workplace, among your coworkers and colleagues in the factory. In order to achieve this, we will rip out the old ideas of the boss worker relationship and institute a new system of worker self management."
 SBA_regional_establish_the_council_of_trade_unions_desc: "Though many trade unions existed in central Siberia prior to the Black Army's triumph over the region's warlords and despots, they are in much need of reform. The Kostinsty, for example, are too fond of Bolshevism to be entrusted with the influence they currently have, while the rest are too small-scale to unite all workers across Siberia. Thus, an official council, endorsed and supported by the Security Council, must be established to unite all unions and prevent authoritarians from subverting their ranks."
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_kostinsty_desc: "The Kostinsty are a militant worker's organization that have existed in the area before we arrived. While our politics are not perfectly aligned, with their leadership seemingly leaning towards pre-war Bukharinist philosophy as opposed to our more radical anarcho communist policies, their organizational expertise and influence could prove incredibly useful to us. Their leadership has indicated that they are not opposed to working alongside us, and have offered assistance in the implementation of our redesigned Siberian Plan. We would be fools not to accept their offer."
 SBA_regional_the_bounty_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "The Siberian Plan is almost complete. Already thousands of industrial machines, distributed across the whole of Siberia both to cities and towns alike, are being installed and tested for the first time. Electrical light is beginning to shine in places that had never so much as seen a light bulb before, just as thousands of positions in new coal plants across Siberia open up. The standard of living for millions across Siberia is about to experience a quantum leap, and in doing so we will thrust ourselves into becoming one of the foremost industrial powers of Russia. At this rate, we may one day eclipse even Germany..."
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_peasant_communes_desc: "Communism is inherently an ideology that favours the community over private individuals. What greater community is there of men and women than that of their whole land? We must encourage isolated rural communities, typically left unrepresented in government, to reach out and join the economic and political scene of the country. While production in a single rural community might be small, if all the rural towns and villages across the Free Territory work together, then they will know true prosperity."
 SBA_regional_develop_the_altai_region_desc: "Altai is a region of great industrial potential. While infrastructure is minimal in the region, its natural resources are practically untapped, and has a large enough population to sustain several mineral extraction and factory sites. Even just the first step to achieving this goal of industrialization within this region, that being laying down railway tracks, should be enough to begin boosting agricultural and mineral output over the course of the next few weeks as we begin pouring resources into the region."
 SBA_regional_facilitate_rural_mechanization_desc: "One of the important features of communal life is self sufficiency. While this is often not possible, given that more rural communities simply do not have the skilled labour or industrial facilities to produce things like modern electronics or automobiles, we can set these communities up with the means to acquire such items. By facilitating mechanization in the rural areas of the Free Territory, we can help rural communes outproduce their needs, allowing them to exchange the extra produce and livestock for items the rural population cannot obtain. Not to mention, having an agricultural surplus will be useful for expanding the population."
 SBA_regional_ensure_rural_interconnection_desc: "There are rural regions of the free territory that are simply unfit for major industrialization and expansion. These regions are either too isolated, or not populous enough, or are in an area vulnerable to foreign invasion. For these areas, the best we can do is extend infrastructure to connect their territories to our own. This can be done in a variety of ways, from building actual roads or railroads, to setting up phone lines or the simpler telegraph lines, to extending the power grid into their territory. This won't provide manufacturing jobs for these people, but it will hopefully allow them to attain somewhat of a higher standard of living."
 SBA_regional_enlightenment_for_all_desc: "While Russia has been embroiled in the constant civil wars and skirmishes that have resulted because of this warlordism, the superpowers of the world have been advancing their technological arsenal. From the space race to the development of transistor computing, they have expanded their computational, agricultural, and industrial output tenfold, while we have been forced to rely on decades old machinery. If we are to bring ourselves up to their level, we must begin investing into the local schools, universities, and labs in the Free Territory. Giving these centers of learning funding and autonomy is the surest way to raise our educational standard."
 SBA_regional_the_interventionist_approach_desc: "All around Russia there are nations with the capability to destroy our nation with the press of a button. Thousands of ICBMs, SLBMs, and IRBMs are armed and ready to rain down atomic fire upon Russia should those nations choose to do so. Even without such weapons, crushing our nation would be easy with modern guns and missiles they have at their disposal. Our technological ability has stagnated heavily since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and that has left our nation vulnerable. While we do not currently possess the technology or skilled technical workers capable of developing these weapons, creating an education system under the supervision of the military council will surely help us begin to bridge the gap in technological ability."
 SBA_regional_trust_in_the_educators_desc: "Some have argued that in order to bring our educational system up to par with our more advanced neighbors, we need to place the educational system under the power of the military council, so that we might bring all students and educators to the same level of educational quality across the board. This is foolish. Different regions will have different needs. Rural villages might want to teach their students about tractor maintenance and engine repair, whereas cities might want to educate their students in power production and computer science. We should trust local educators to decide on a curriculum that benefits their community's needs."
 SBA_regional_inspire_progressive_thought_desc: "Control of education is of the utmost importance to the security of the Free Territory. While the military council would like to leave the communes' educators to their own devices, it would invite subversion and reactionary ideas to be indoctrinated into our nation's youth. Anarchism as a whole would be threatened if the military doesn't step in and prevent its collapse. The fifth column must be stopped. To that end, we will create an all encompassing curriculum that will teach both the basics necessary for the students to function as adults as well as professing the tenets of anarchism."
 SBA_regional_the_right_to_well_being_desc: "Just as Pyotr Kropotkin wrote, vague proclamations of "the right to work" or "to each the whole result of his labour" are insufficient. Not one individual should be left behind in our pursuit of a truly free and equal society. Some may say that the scars of war left on Russia make sacrifices necessary, and inequality an unfortunate fact. We see such excuses as what they are; the lies of an elite class wishing to consolidate the growing wealth of Russia into their own hands. Every kilowatt hour that our energy production grows, every good that leaves the production line, every building that finishes construction should be a victory which the common man can reap the benefits of. Well-being for all is not a dream."
 SBA_regional_provide_schools_for_all_desc: "Education is a powerful tool - the increasing literacy of the European working classes in the 19th century catalysed the growth of socialist movements, as political theory was no longer the domain of intellectuals alone. Not only this, but the education of the masses lead to an unprecedented growth in production and technology. Unfortunately, as a mostly rural and unstable region, central Siberia lacks the school coverage and quality of more developed areas. It is imperative that new schools be constructed to ensure the entirety of our population has access to quality education."
 SBA_regional_expand_research_cooperatives_desc: "Russia has been left behind the rest of the world in many aspects, but perhaps most significantly is in technological progress. While televisions became common for American households, radios were considered a luxury here. While fighter jets were being developed in Japan, we repaired Bukharin-era planes. While Germany stockpiled thousands of nuclear warheads, we are yet to build a single one.\n\nTo remedy this, communal research initiatives must be supported and encouraged greatly. The innovation that brought the Ukrainian Black Army the tachanka must bring ours tanks and jets."
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_union_desc: "The Siberian plan has been a greater success than we could have ever thought possible. Even before its completion, industrial productivity across Siberia has grown by over 200 percent. In the past month alone, energy production in Siberia has grown by over 330 million kilowatt-hours, approximately the same amount as the Hoover dam produces every month. And all this has been by the mandate of our Security Council. Voices of fears that such a council might detract from our civil liberties, or even worsen the long term prosperity of our nation are now silent in the face of such great accomplishment."
 SBA_regional_reach_for_the_dawn_desc: "Rigid economic planning both restricts the rights of our citizens, and harms our economy long term. If we truly wish to see Russia prosper, and the glory of communism prevail, we must abandon these authoritarian ideas of controlling the economy through the state. Bukharin tried, and failed. If we wish to see true prosperity, we must allow worker's organizations and unions to decide for themselves what to produce as a natural reaction to the needs and demands of society and the economy. While some decry such a system as capitalism under another name, we reject such a title. This is a true socialist economy."
 SBA_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "The Free Territory's borders are always at risk. Warlords, bandits, and raiders stand ready to raid and loot our cities and towns at the drop of a dime. It has become necessary to begin reforming the militia into a fully fledged army. In order to achieve this, we will need to invest into more specialized equipment, like anti-tank, anti-air, and sniper weapons, in order to increase our army's effectiveness. Additionally, we will need to begin increasing the discipline of our army. These men can no longer simply be volunteer farmers, they must be soldiers, and we will drill this into them."
 SBA_regional_maintain_the_flawless_legacy_desc: "We cannot abandon our roots. The militia organization that is the Black Army is one that is for and by the people. We cannot go back upon this legacy now. Abandoning this legacy would mean fundamentally changing the foundation of our society. Additionally, given that the military is so intertwined with our government, by instituting a top down structure of organization in the Black army, we would be inviting corruption and the threat of coup from the ruling generals in a newly reformed army. For the safety of our anarchic way of life, despite its faults, we must maintain our election based military."
 SBA_regional_welcome_the_rehabilitated_desc: "The Black Army has been supremely successful in its march of conquest across Siberia, but cracks are starting to show in the army. Our manpower reserves have been slowly atrophied as our reunification efforts have progressed, and we may not be able to rely on our home communes for many more men. In order to rectify this, we should begin integrating conquered militaries into our ranks. Not only would it alleviate our manpower issues, but it would also ease integration of their territory into ours considerably."
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_liberation_war_desc: "The wars we have fought in our efforts to reunify Russia were not one by sheer brute force and manpower, like those Russia has fought in the past, but rather with the cunning and finesse of smart generals and strategic thinking. We can use these reports and plans and draw on the experience of these generals and commanders to continue developing the military doctrines the old Soviet government had begun developing in the Second World War. Already, we have begun collecting and teaching the strategies used in the previous conflicts in our military schools."
 SBA_regional_industrial_warfare_desc: "The Great War of so many decades past was catastrophic not only in its casualties, but also in its material consumption. The lesson had been learned by all nations of the world after the war. The development of heavy artillery, tanks, and aeroplanes meant that wars of the future would demand a strong industry to support the militaries of the future. This theory has been proved correct. Our military conquests have only been possible thus far due to the hard workers at home pushing out thousands of guns, artillery, and planes month after month. Unfortunately, the farther our military ventures out into Russia, the large our military needs to become to defend our long borders. Thus, we must expand our military industry to keep pace with our industry."
 SBA_regional_reinforce_the_soldiers_desc: "The military machine continues to demand more and more manpower as we spread out across Russia. In order to sate this demand, we must boost recruitment in newly conquered territories. While volunteers have always been welcome from newly integrated territory, the amount of volunteers joining up was always tiny. Simply put, conquered peoples do not take well to their conquerors, even though we have afforded these people almost complete autonomy. We must begin a mass recruitment drive in the new communes and endear ourselves to the populace. With hope, we should see increased enlistment in the new territories."
 SBA_regional_following_the_falcon_desc: "Defeating Novosibirsk was no simple task. While their army might not have been as strong as ours, their air force certainly outshined ours. We suffered far too many casualties at the hands of enemy air support to ignore this problem any more. Thankfully, we no longer need to. Novosibirsk is home to one of the largest aircraft production plants in all of Russia, and consequently is also home to one of the largest air fleets in Russia. Additionally, this fleet will be serviced by some of the best plane mechanics in Siberia. The Free Territory takes another step into modernity."
 SBA_regional_black_wings_above_desc: "The Black Army has had little experience with aerial warfare in the past. While we have used some planes in combat in the past, simply put, we didn't have the industrial capacity or skilled airmen needed to operate an air force. Given our size and the relative strength of our enemies however, we must create and integrate a true air force into our military forces. We have a vast array of former pilots to educate the next generation of airmen, somewhat modern designs for airplanes, and the industrial capacity to begin manufacturing said airplanes."
 SBA_regional_experimental_helicopter_designs_desc: "Helicopters are one of the many technological advances made by the world while Russia regressed into infighting and warlordism. These strange flying devices are unlike airplanes of the past, in that they use a vertical rotor liftoff system whose benefits include aerial attacks on ground targets and even transporting troops and supplies to areas where a landing strip is not available. The devices have great potential, as seen from their performance in the South African War, and domestic development has already begun."
 SBA_regional_past_the_tachanka_desc: "Modern armoured and motorized technology has once again changed warfare for Russia. Formerly, our design had revolved around building large amounts of cheap tanks to overwhelm the German enemy. While tank production never reached the amounts needed to truly test this military doctrine, many generals had supported the idea of simply overwhelming their enemies. However, research into the tanks doctrines of Japan and Germany have indicated a focus on mobility and quality. We should strive to learn from their doctrines and designs and update our armoured and motorized military tactics."
 SBA_regional_tanks_for_peace_desc: "If Russia learned anything from the German invasion two decades ago, it was the utility and efficient brutality of mechanized warfare. Russian troops were cut up and overwhelmed by the speed and explosive power that panzer divisions had at their disposal. The failure of Bukharin to build a tank force capable of protecting the Soviet Union will not be repeated. Our neighbors have surely come to the same conclusions as us. Developing an armoured corps for the Black Army must become a priority if we wish to secure our borders."
 SBA_regional_compile_the_strategies_desc: "Despite recent efforts to reform the army and enforce some form of basic military doctrine, many officers end up implementing their own tactics or offensive strategy many times in opposition of what might be optimal. We should endeavor to create a unified military doctrine that our officers can follow in order to further whatever grand strategy is being implemented during any wars we might be involved with in the future. This will allow us to get a better understanding of how the war is going and as to the capabilities of our troops, instead of simply hoping that an officer makes the right decision."
 SBA_regional_military_egalitarianism_desc: "One of the most outstanding features of the Black Army was its democratic military structure. Unlike most every other army, power was derived not from the top, among the generals and highest ranking military leaders, but rather from the lowest soldiers, who elected their own officers and promoted those who they thought were best equipped. The generals at the top of the military command structure are considered no more equal in terms of value than any other man in the military, and it is precisely because of this that our men fight as hard as they do."
 SBA_regional_the_tomsk_firearms_collective_desc: "While the people of Tomsk are well suited to our style of democracy, having already had local democratic structures they could use, they have yet to adopt the gun culture so vital to our defense. People either do not have the interest or the money to purchase weapons, and most did not feel the need to have one, feeling that their armies would protect them. Our presence here indicates that this was obviously not true. Thus, we should create an organization to educate the people of Tomsk as to the need and operation of guns."
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_liberation_desc: "The ultimate duty of Black army must be to spread our anarchist way of life to all of Russia, so that the peoples of creeds might be freed from the tyranny of states. More so than defense, we must prepare ourselves to be on the offense. Traditionally, conscripts signed up for the Black Army in order to defend our homes, not conquer others. We must convince them that in order to defend ourselves, we must liberate everyone else. Soon, all of Russia will fly the black flag."
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_self_defense_desc: "The purpose of our militias have always been to protect, not to harm. The Black Army is not like the terrorizing force of Yagoda. They fought for domination and power, we fight for peace and bread. Our past conquests should have little bearing on our future. In order to preserve the dignity and integrity of the Siberian Black Army and the Free Territory, we must prevent ourselves from following down the same tyrannical path our predecessors did, and perhaps in doing so we might finally find prosperity."
 SBA_regional_looking_outwards_desc: "Geopolitics is a game of diplomacy and tact just as much as it is armies and wars. In order to secure the Free Territories, we must assess our standing with our neighbors to the west and the east to assess whether they are a threat to us or not, and if they are to assess how much of a threat they pose. And, should we find ourselves to be fortunate to share a border with a nation friendly to the Free Territory, arranging some trade deals or defensive pacts might serve to benefit our interests."
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_liberation_desc: "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of global liberation. If an opportunity to support our fellow socialists or anarchist friends abroad, we should seize the opportunity to do so. Arms, funding, technology... If there exists a need, we shall strive to provide for it. Let us be the kindling that sparks the flames of revolution in all nations. It may cause us to lose reputation among our global peers, perhaps even spark aggression on their part, but if we can help liberate even one oppressed peoples, then we will know that our efforts have not been in vain."
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_protection_desc: "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of protection. The last thing we need is to anger the likes of Japan or Germany and spark another war to devastate Russia. Should the socialists and anarchists liberate themselves from their oppressors, or begin a campaign to do in their own nation, they will have our full support, but not our weapons. Besides, nothing good can ever come of intervening in a foreign conflict. Just look at the United States, it's doubtful they ever expected to be in South Africa as long as they did."
 SBA_regional_exporting_the_revolution_desc: "In order to support our socialist and anarchist friends around the world, we will need to first find them. A new organization will be created, clandestine in nature and global in scale. Its purpose? To find and aid the revolutionaries of the world, even the ones that don't yet know they are yet. From just beyond our borders to the farthest reaches of Africa and South America, our men will be there, providing both the means and motivation for the people to liberate themselves. Some might call it propaganda, we prefer to call it the truth."
 SBA_regional_declare_a_safe_harbor_desc: "The world has become a harsh place. Across the world, individuals are being persecuted for race, religion, ideology, you name it. The Free Territory isn't like that. We are one of the few nations on Earth that can profess to be truly free. We must open our borders to the world and become the safe harbor of the world. So long as you do not intend to cause harm or havok within our borders, you are welcome to join our grand experiment. Additionally, immigration has its own benefits for us as well. The more numerous we are, the better we can protect ourselves."
 SBA_regional_an_eye_to_the_world_desc: "Russia is a harsh mistress, and our neighbors are even harsher. We need to know what they are doing at all times in order to defend ourselves. To that end, we must create some kind of clandestine organization to achieve this end. Should our neighbors begin mobilizing against us, we will know. If our neighbors develop new tanks and aircraft, we will know. If the leader of our neighbour country goes to walk his dog, we will know. With this new agency, the Black Army will have a hand in every folder and an eye on every nation."
 SBA_regional_solidarity_with_the_world_desc: "Building a spy agency is no simple task. It requires time and patience to build something so large and important in secret. Decisions to be made, directions to take. For example, defensive intelligence organizations are often operated and structured differently than more aggressive intelligence services. A focus on long term infiltration and surveillance may be more important than foreign instigation and smuggling. Neither choice is poor, just a different way in which to allocate your resources."

 SBA_power_struggle_siuda_winning_a_game_i_was_never_playing_desc: "As the Siberian War has drawn to a close, it was expected that the cessation of official hostilities would mean the end of hardship for the Free Territories, and a new period of integration and further unification could begin. However, life is never so easy.\n\nAs Stepanov has begun to establish his own sphere of influence in the former Far Eastern territories, it has become clear as to just how much of a threat this developing struggle may become. As the frontiers across the Baikal have become hot with the power struggle of the traitorous Stepanov, it is now obvious that action must be taken.\n\nWhile Siuda has been shocked by this sinister betrayal -and from his inner circle no less- his determination remains resolute as ever. If Anarchism is to survive, Siuda must persevere. Siuda will need to play Stepanov's game in this struggle, lest anarchism dissolve forever."

With the overthrowing of the corrupt system with the February Revolution, the system should have stayed buried. How it has sprung up in the Far East is beyond most any anarchist. It is high time that the people of Chita are reminded why the system had ended in the first place, and reveal to them the best aspects of anarchism.\n\nIf we hope to show the people of Chita just how much anyone can accomplish when cooperating with their neighbor, we will need to give them a beacon to anarchism. Coincidentally, we may be able to dispose of the last monument to monarchism, as well as enlighten the people of Chita.\n\nThrough renovating and retrofitting the Tsar's palace, we will be able to convert the building into the meeting place of the city's council. As well as killing two birds with one stone, the propaganda value of this renovation will be priceless, certainly swaying much of the populace towards true anarchism."

The most despicable ideology, that which was responsible for endless death and destruction, not to mention the dissolution of Russia, found a foothold in Amur. How this came to be has continued to be a mystery, though time is short, and action must be taken.\n\nSiuda has opted to begin a campaign of de-Nazification of the region surrounding Amur. While this program is directed towards bringing the population of Amur closer to the true meaning of anarchism, we must also use it as a tool to dismember the image of Nazism within the Free Territories. One of the foremost propaganda objectives, however, will be to take out the neon swastika taken from Harbin, and to record blowing up the swastika for propaganda distribution. Simply to ensure the metaphor is not lost on anyone."

As the people of the port city starved and froze in the streets, the fascists sat upon their mountain of riches and American funding. No more will the people of Magadan suffer under this injustice.\n\nIn an effort to root out the fascists and restore power to the people, we must redistribute the arms imported from America, and ensure that all within the port city are aware of the misdeeds done to them by the fascists of years past. Reminding them that those years are passed, and the best is yet to begin will only bring the city onto the side of Siuda."

 SBA_power_struggle_siuda_remember_the_tyrant_desc: "Throughout the wastes of the Far East, you can ask any opponent of authoritarianism as to who Genrikh Yagoda was, and they will tell you of the remnants of the Far Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic of years past. They will tell you of the securocratic measures implemented without end in sight. They will tell you of the NKVD kicking down doors in the night, all in the name of a doomed nation. They will tell you of the Siberian War against the Central Siberian Republic, doing nothing but wearing both nations down to nothing, and devastating the birthplace of Siberian anarchism. Why, then, do the people of Irkutsk continue to think of the madman fondly?\n\nIt is something of a mystery, that is without question, though now is not the time to ponder why some may idolize the tyrant, so much as it is to strike these memories down. Those that do not remember the worst excesses of the NKVD will be shown how horrific Yagoda's reign was, whether or not they want to hear it."

Leading this brave rebellion was a man known as Valery Sablin, and his intentions were once pure. However, as soon as this man gained an inch of power, he betrayed his beliefs. Enacting conscription, the elimination of his political enemies, and countless other oppressive acts, it would not take long until Valery Sablin closely resembled the very man he meant to oppose. Even now, there are those in Buryatia who continue to celebrate the actions of Sablin. This must come to an end.\n\nJust as a supposed "Second Red October" occurred within Buryatia, there must be a counterbalance to this horrible misjudgment; the first Black October will occur within the city, and all will know of the wonders of anarchism."

While religion is entirely legal within the Free Territories, the notion of giving any kind of power to the church is an uncomfortable notion to many within the communes, up to and including Siuda himself. Of course, those of the northern Siberian wastelands do not share our sentiment. If we hope to bring them onto our side, we will need to strike a compromise with the local communes.\n\nWhile this will likely do plenty for our popularity, it may not be enough to bring all of the region to our side. As a result, it has been decided that Siuda will begin a variety of charities during his trip to the north. With a little bit of luck, it may be enough to bring the north onto our side."

As his position is vital to the maintenance of the Free Territories, the expansion of anarchism across Siberia has necessitated the inclusion of new additions to the position, such as Vasily Shukshin, and the establishment of a new board, that being the "Communal Economic Directive Board." As this system is both powerful and apolitical, it can easily make or break the destiny of anarchism.\n\nOf course, we would much prefer if anarchism would survive.

With her experience and skill as a writer, Taratuta may prove invaluable in this ever-present power struggle.\n\nBeing the skilled writer that she is, it would be far from a challenge to write a children's book on the adventures of... a character fighting for the dreams of anarchism... in a fantasy world, against the vile... dragon who would want otherwise for the people of Russia.\n\nIn due time, this piece will surely become a best-seller."

In the face of anarchism's greatest threat, however, alliances cannot be determined by a friendship or lack thereof.\n\nSiuda will host a private meeting with Valenteev and will do his damnedest to shore up support in favor of true anarchism.

Over the past decade within the Siberian Black Army, Ivan Stepanov's goal has not shifted in the slightest, and he has slaved to acquire power within the Free Territories. As the Far East lays open with potential, and Siuda's populism has yet to take hold of the region, the way lays open for a new age of anarchism.\n\nThe game is afoot. May Stepanov lead Russia with strength, and strike hard against the weak anarchists of Siuda's following."

This collection of officers, Generals, Field Marshals, and government officials have all maintained a position of power one way or another, and continue to maintain a position of power.\n\nOf course, if we hope to establish any kind of a foothold in Chita, we will begin the standard procedures of wining and dining these aristocrats. Assuming all goes well within the city of Chita, a new stronghold to Stepanov's influence will be established, and Siuda's anarchism will come one step closer to disappearing into nothing."

This subordinate has approached Stepanov with a wondrous deal of grand potential. As there remains plenty of resources in the arsenal of these blackshirts, they have offered to provide the efforts of Stepanov and the Black Army with files on the RFP, white emigre donations and wealth, and muscle, should it come to that, in exchange for becoming the governors of Amur once more following the success of Stepanov's coup.\n\nWhile the legitimacy of these blackshirts are undoubtedly still up in the air, we may have no choice but to accept this deal, for both lack of alternatives and lack of reasons to refrain from accepting such a perfect deal."

 SBA_power_struggle_stepanov_the_cowards_foundation_desc: "One of the greatest failings of the RFP within Magadan was that they relied far too heavily on foreign, unreliable troops. Mercenaries, more specifically. As the armies of Matkovsky's state have proven insufficient to lead a nation as a whole, we may be able to use the mercenaries for a more specialized use.\n\nSince the total annihilation of the Far East, the mercenaries of Magadan have been spread across the region like dust in the wind, though remain open for business from the sounds of things. Should we hope to establish ourselves as a proper, professional force, we need to bring these disparate elements into our sphere. Soon enough, a new army of bodyguards and personal security will join the ranks of the Black Army, dedicated to the survival of the Free Territories."

Assuming that these ex-NKVD hold no quarrels in keeping the spirits of the army high -no matter the exact army or cause- then the Siberian Black Army will find itself far stronger than before.\n\nOf course, few soldiers of the NKVD will be persuaded to join Stepanov's cause, though we have a tool for bringing those uncertain soldiers on side. Should these ex-NKVD decide to join Stepanov's army, we will do what can be done to bring these brave soldiers a life of luxury and pleasure, so long as they manage to aid in suppression efforts whenever needed."

Unfortunately for Ivan Stepanov, he knows he lacks skill in the first point thanks to his proficiency in the second. Similarly clear to Stepanov is the one thing that seems to work well with the people of Buryatia; populism.\n\nSomething which is known to all those within the Black Army is the simple fact that we cannot allow for Siuda to reach the region before we do. If so much as a whisper from Siuda reaches the other side of the Baikal, we may completely lose Buryatia. This can not happen. Even if Stepanov is incompetent with speeches, so much as even a bad speech will run laps around the notion of simply letting Siuda take hold of the region."

Siuda would try to trick these northerners into thinking that he doesn't despise the very notion of religion, though we know that this is clearly not the case. If anyone is going to warn the north wasteland of Siuda's intentions, then it is us.\n\nIvan Stepanov will visit northern Siberia, and inform them of Siuda's horrible beliefs, of strictly enforced state atheism, and of oppressing the north into the Free Territories. While the legitimacy of these claims is up to debate, it will be the responsibility of our own brave leader Stepanov to warn his fellow Orthodox Christians of the evils of anarchism."

 SBA_power_struggle_stepanov_return_to_form_desc: "Throughout Ivan Stepanov's adventures throughout the Far East, instability and anger have been growing at home, as his attention has been called away from suppressing the excesses of anarchism. Within the city of Tomsk, protests have been mounting and mounting since the Siberian Black Army has encroached further on the state apparatus of the Free Territories, as well as demanding for Stepanov's return to Central Siberia.\n\nAsk, and the people will receive. As the protests have already been crushed beneath the competent soldiers at home, we now stand with several brave Siberian Black Army members and substantially fewer residents to the city of Tomsk. For these soldiers which operated as instructed, it is high time that we reward them for their efforts. Such is the reward for those who support the interests of Stepanov, and we are liable to distribute countless more medals over the coming months."

In spite of neither one being true anarchists, and doing no more than lip service to anarchism, the pair have become invaluable to the state of the military. That is where their similarities end, however.\n\nAs Stepanov has worked tirelessly to become the preeminent leader of the Free Territories, Mishurenko has instead labored to prepare the Siberian Black Army to retake Russia from the Germanic occupiers. Regardless of differences, however, it is clear that Stepanov's past efforts to court Mishurenko must come to a head, otherwise, Stepanov will forever lose out on a close ally."

With his staunch beliefs in anarchism seemingly unshakeable in tenacity, Stepan Valenteev has only weakened our position within the Siberian Black Army. While the most apolitical of all military men in the Free Territories, Valenteev only continues to be the only remaining potential ally to Siuda. As we approach the final days until a clear victor is decided, it is clear that we only have so much time. Due to his strong ideological convictions, we have no way to bring Valenteev onto our side, not with the time we have. The solution, then, is simple.\n\nValenteev is too powerful, too ideologically opposed, and too far into Siuda's sphere that there is no longer anything that can be done for him. It is such a shame that there happens to be a plot of a... radical, extremist anarchist who is looking to rid the Siberian Black Army of all statism.\n\nSuch a shame for Valenteev."

Not anymore.\n\nStepanov has spent his whole life fighting for this day. Every objective, duty, and ambition has been nothing but a byproduct of his hope to lead Russia. Through the corrupt, dysfunctional anarchism which stands in his way, Ivan Stepanov holds no regret in his heart, or sadness in his actions. This was the plan, and it progresses without failure, hesitation, or remorse.\n\nAll facets of power lay firmly within the grasp of Ivan Stepanov. Siuda's anarchism has fought him every step of the way, though it was far from enough to stop the inevitable progression of Ivan Stepanov.\n\nMay Russia live forevermore, and may Stepanov take the helm."

The General Assembly assumed that a greater level of interconnection between urban and rural communes would allow resources each are suited for to spread more easily between the two types of commune, Siuda instead argues that such trade actually works to weaken smaller rural communes.

Even if our nuclear stockpile never matches the likes of Germany and Japan, the fact that we can pose an organizational military threat may be enough to protect us."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_king_of_the_anarchic_wastes: "아나키 쓰레기의 왕"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_king_of_the_anarchic_wastes_desc: "It has been a long road to reach this pinnacle of military and social achievement. From the tributaries of the Ob to the shores of Magadan, and from the streets of Tomsk to the peaks of the Verkhoyansk, our Black Army stands triumphant over the entirety of Siberia. Ivan Stepanov has taken our glorious effort to heights undreamt of, and he now reigns as the uncrowned king of this vast territory."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_deliberations_of_stepanov: "스테파노프의 숙고"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_deliberations_of_stepanov_desc: "Now that the Black Army reigns victorious over Siberia, there are important choices to be made. First and foremost, how must this land be governed? In order to shape the future of our territory, we must carefully balance the idealism of the original Black Army with the necessities and responsibilities of great power. Shall Stepanov seize unquestioned control, guiding our territory towards further triumph, but risking backlash for his challenge to our founding ideals? Or should he bide his time, acting with subtlety and paying the proper respect to the traditions which have brought us so far? This choice may determine the future of Siberia."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_put_on_a_good_show: "좋은 공연 하기"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_put_on_a_good_show_desc: "Without a doubt, we will need to tighten our grip on Siberia. But we cannot simply proclaim a dictatorship. The territory would rise up against us in an instant, and our agenda would be dead. Along with us. No, we must act with more subtlety than that. We should work within the established systems and traditions of the Black Army, and only begin sidelining the communes once it's clear that they have no hope of resisting us. Siberia will not be ours overnight, perhaps, but we cannot be rash about this."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_fighting_off_the_vultures: "독수리와 싸우다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_fighting_off_the_vultures_desc: "The Black Army may have conquered the vastest, most unforgiving swath of land on the planet, but there are still many who see us as weak. From the proxies of Japan to the despots of western Russia, there are vultures circling, seeking to peck at our flesh. General Stepanov has therefore decided that the Black Army should begin a new campaign of public strengthening. There will be extensive recruitment drives, bold military exercises near the borders of our enemies, and we will even commission a new series of films for public consumption. The overall appearance will be one of strength, to cow those who would happily see us torn apart. In keeping with our anarchist traditions, of course."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_theres_only_room_for_one_state: "한 국가를 위한 공간만이 있다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_theres_only_room_for_one_state_desc: "Public memory can be a surprisingly malleable thing. Through new propaganda leaflets and posters, as well as some alterations to education curriculums across Siberia, we can start to establish a new version of history. In this new telling, Siuda will be portrayed as a leader who was flawed at best, and whose ambitions would have brought down the Black Army as a whole. Meanwhile, General Stepanov will be portrayed as a visionary anarchist leader. He who controls the past, after all, controls the future. And this shall be our future."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mandatory_freedoms: "의무적인 자유"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mandatory_freedoms_desc: "Years of the Black Army's conflict and struggle have produced a set of traditions forged in blood and fire. These traditions have, over time, solidified into laws customarily obeyed by the many communes of Siberia. Both common administrative law and higher ideals of human rights have been laid out, and it is our job to enforce them. Sending the Black Army, and armed auxiliaries, into the communes will make it clear to all that our territory is governed with both justice and strength. There shall be law, order, and liberty in Siberia, by whatever means are necessary."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_on_every_council: "모든 평의회에 장교를"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_on_every_council_desc: "The Black Army is the backbone of our territory. It has won us dominion over Siberia, and secured the wellbeing of the people against every despotic and reactionary threat. Not every resident of our territories is a soldier, though. Most live humble civilian lives on communes. However, they rely upon us for protection, and as such, we should require that the Black Army have more of a say in the governance of local communes and regions. By requiring every communal council to have at least one Black Army liaison, we can make sure that our interests are represented. It's for the good of all."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_ask_for_permission_first: "권한 요청 먼저"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_ask_for_permission_first_desc: "Years of the Black Army's conflict and struggle have produced a set of traditions forged in blood and fire. These traditions have, over time, solidified into laws customarily obeyed by the many communes of Siberia. However, some of those laws may have to change. By calling a convention of delegates from the many communes and regions, we can create a new code of laws. Such a code would grant us far more legitimacy in the eyes of the people, and is perfectly fitting with the anarchist ideal of the popular will. So long as the process is malleable, we can use democracy to achieve our own ends."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_advisory_communes: "자문 공동체"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_advisory_communes_desc: "The commune system forms the main unit of social order in our territory. Most people, be they farmers, artisans, or educated professionals, live in a commune system. For the most part, these communes have also formed the main unit of governance, with their councils deciding upon the allocation of resources and the administration of justice. However, this cannot stand. With the advent of the Security Council, and the realities of governing as vast a realm as Siberia, one thing is clear: hayseed peasants distributing harvests and levies is no basis for a system of government. The commune governments may have an advisory role, but the leadership of the Black Army will be doing the grunt work of administration from here on out."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_ascendancy_of_military_anarchism: "전위대 아나키즘의 등극"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_ascendancy_of_military_anarchism_desc: "The old traditions of communal governance are all well and good, but the world is a dangerous place. Those who would threaten us must fear our might. While we may fly the black flag, and while our soldiers may cite Bakunin, we are still an army. By blending the ideals of anarchism with dedication to protecting and expanding our gains, the Black Army will triumph. Vanguard anarchism has ascended across our territory, and we will lay down our lives to defend it."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_keeping_the_generals_in_check: "장군들 견제"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_keeping_the_generals_in_check_desc: "The Black Army may be run by those who claim the title of \"anarchist\", but it still has an officer corps. The Security Council is dominated by a handful of these men, a set of generals who have earned the loyalty of their troops through kindness and terror alike. We'll need to deal with them carefully. Each has their own set of flaws, and each their own virtues. And not all are worth keeping around."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_kilchichakovs_greed: "킬치차코프의 탐욕"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_kilchichakovs_greed_desc: "Mikhail Kilchichakov is a liability. At least, that's his reputation. His main motivation for ascending to leadership in the Black Army is greed, and everybody knows it. He skims off the top of budgets and requisitions all the time. With that said, he's also competent. His administrative staff run large swathes of our territory with skill and aplomb, while Kilichichakov himself is a fine general. He will be loyal, useful, and while they may inspire some disgust, his excesses can be easily swept under the rug. Mikhail can be kept, as long as he doesn't prove himself to be more of an embarrassment than an asset."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mishurenkos_toy_soldiers: "미슈렌코의 장난감 병정"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mishurenkos_toy_soldiers_desc: "Androniy Mishuernko is a warmonger. He's proud of it, too. At Council meetings, he often advocates for new enlistment, new equipment, and new offensives against the enemies of the Black Army. A charitable observer might call him enthusiastic. A less charitable one might call him a rabid madman, and we aren't exactly charitable ourselves. Still, Mishuernko is a highly capable general, who is, moreover, fairly loyal to us. Androniy can be kept, as long as his bloodthirsty eccentricities don't push us over the edge. But, what are the odds of that?"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_valenteevs_scheming: "발렌티예프의 계략"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_valenteevs_scheming_desc: "Stepan Valenteev is a threat. There is no escaping it. Valenteev and Siuda were old friends and ideological comrades, and Valenteev likely sees himself as the natural successor. What's more, he's good at his job. Valenteev has distinguished himself on the field of battle, and commands the respect of many of the Black Army's rank-and-file. His experience and capability makes him too dangerous to have around. We must prepare to have him removed from the picture, in a deniable situation. A minor operation gone wrong, perhaps. A friendly fire incident. Something of that nature. The most important thing is that Valenteev must die."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_open_secret: "공공연한 비밀"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_open_secret_desc: "There are times when gradualism is called for. When a course of action must be taken with the utmost precaution, lest that course become uncontrollable.\n\nThis is not one of those times.\n\nThe vast territories of Siberia which have come under our control must be broken to the will of Stepanov. Otherwise, the rabble of the Black Army will come under the control of men like Valenteev. That cannot happen. We must take control of the army and assert control over the BA, the communes, and all within our territory. The people will all say that we are dictators in the clothing of anarchists, but if we triumph, it won't matter what they say."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_greatest_threat_is_inside_us: "가장 큰 위협은 우리 안에 있다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_greatest_threat_is_inside_us_desc: "The General Assembly has been a useful tool for maintaining power in Siberia. However, it is only useful up to a point. Too much dissent and disunity spilling out of the Assembly would pose a major risk to our political efforts. Therefore, we must dissolve the General Assembly and assume greater powers for ourselves."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_targeting_the_next_generation: "다음세대를 목표로"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_targeting_the_next_generation_desc: "Children are, in many ways, more useful than adults. They willl parrot any slogan you feed them, adapt to any situation you place them in, and, best of all, they can conform to any ideology that you steep them in. It is in the youth of Siberia that the future of the Black Army will be found, and it is on the youth of Siberia that our efforts must be focused."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_conscription_lotteries: "징병복권"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_conscription_lotteries_desc: "All true anarchists must be willing to lay down their lives for the cause of the Black Army. If one is unwilling to die for their commune, and for the good of all their peers, then there must be consequences, and the conscription process, regrettable though it may be, is one such consequence. In communities where recruitment of volunteers is insufficient, we will hold lotteries to draft new levies for the struggle against outside tyrants. It will certainly save some money on higher education."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_schooling_required_to_hold_a_gun: "총을 잡는 데 학교 교육은 필요 없다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_schooling_required_to_hold_a_gun_desc: "In the salons of Tomsk, men may have pondered the nature of education, and planned esoteric curricula. But this is not Tomsk. In our territory, one does not need a diploma or certificate to hold a rifle in defense of the Black Army's ideals. Our education system will reflect this. Obviously three-year-olds will be taught to count and so forth, but the only colleges we will need are officer academies. The serpents of reaction will be overcome by our swarms of ants!"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_sack_the_teacher_introduce_the_officer: "교사 해고, 장교 소개"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_sack_the_teacher_introduce_the_officer_desc: "Perhaps education is necessary to a functioning society after all. However, that doesn't mean that we cannot adjust our education policies to suit our most pressing needs. Primary and secondary curricula will be geared towards the skills that our territory needs the most, from engineering to medicine to militant anarchist theory. When the time comes, all students will be prepared for battle against the enemies of the Black Army, and that preparation will have come from the classroom and the training ground alike. After all, there will be no difference between the two."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_school_to_soldier_pipeline: "학교에서 병사로"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_school_to_soldier_pipeline_desc: "Continuing with the program of militarized education, it is vital that we blur the lines between a student and a soldier. This can be done through a variety of methods, but we find it best to introduce new youth programs into schools across the territory. These reserve corps for the training of officers will normalize the ideals of vanguard anarchism, and prepare the youth to kill and die in the wars to come. Plus, it will provide them with something to do on their days off. Idle hands are the devils' playground..."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_freedom_has_its_limits: "자유의 한계"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_freedom_has_its_limits_desc: "Anarchism proclaims itself as the pinnacle of human freedom, and this may be true. However, every society in the history of humanity, even stateless ones, has had to put some limits on freedom. After all, one cannot cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater. To permit infinite freedoms would invite chaos, and anarchism is not chaos. It is the people moving in lockstep towards higher triumphs. Yes, freedom has its limits, and in our territory, that will be clear."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_proclaim_the_necessity_of_continuing_revolution: "지속적 혁명의 필요성 선언"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_proclaim_the_necessity_of_continuing_revolution_desc: "All of our radical changes to the structure of the Black Army have inspired whispers among the common people. They say that we have betrayed all of our ideals, and that there is no hope for an anarchist future anywhere in our lands.\n\nWe can change this.\n\nWe shall, therefore, declare publicly that the goal of the Black Army is continuing revolution, until Russia is liberated. Once Russia is liberated, however, there is still an entire planet that lies shackled by tyranny of all stripes. Man was born free, but from the fields of America to the prisons of Germany, from the cities of Japan's empire to the depths of Africa, he is in chains. So let us go to the people and declare that beyond Siberia, out there, is a new world!\n\nOut there is our destiny."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_leader_to_make_makhno_proud: "마흐노를 자랑스럽게 만들 지도자"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_leader_to_make_makhno_proud_desc: "It is finished. The vast realm of Siberia is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, within our control. In cities, villages, and communal fields alike, the people pledge their allegiance to General Stepanov. Their days are filled with work and strictly patriotic leisure, while their children drill with weapons behind their schoolhouses. Nestor Makhno himself, forefather of our efforts, however flawed he may have been, would be proud of what we have accomplished. Asiatic Russia lies under the flag of the Black Army, and Stepanov sits at the head of it all."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_peoples_stick: "인민의 막대기"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_peoples_stick_desc: "Why did America, that vast colossus of a continental superpower, surrender to Japan?\n\nWhy do the three great powers of the world stay in a perpetual standoff, with knives at one another's throats, but with no will to make the cut?\n\nWhy did the German Civil War inspire so much anxiety among the generals and advisors of the world?\n\nThere is only one reason: nuclear weapons. A power with access to nuclear weapons has the ultimate bargaining chip, and can threaten the annihilation of all with just a knowing word. A united Russia with nuclear weapons would be unstoppable.\n\nWe must have our own."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_zelenogorsk_has_much_to_offer: "젤레노고르스크는 많은 것을 제공한다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_zelenogorsk_has_much_to_offer_desc: "Siberia is well-known for its vast mineral resources, and as such, we have a number of options for where to source materials for our nascent nuclear program. One of the best options, in the view of the program heads, would be the Krasnoyarsk region. It is a fairly populous and industrialized region, and the facilities in the city of Zelenogorsk would be particularly well-suited to our purposes. The supply chains required for nuclear weapons development might be somewhat difficult to deal with, but Zelenogorsk remains the experts' top recommendation."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_black_army_mining_detachments: "흑군 채굴 파견대"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_black_army_mining_detachments_desc: "What with the Black Army's perpetual growth and somewhat bloated nature, we have found ourselves with quite a few soldiers with nothing to do at the moment. One of the best uses for such surplus populations is engaging in vital labor, and our nuclear program provides such an opportunity. While they will never fully replace civilian uranium miners, they will provide an essential boost to production. We can begin sending troops to mining facilities at places such as Khiagdinskoye and Elkon immediately. This is an excellent proposal to deal with any potential labor shortages, and will result in greater efficiency for our nuclear program."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_in_every_mine: "모든 광산에 장교를"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_in_every_mine_desc: "It would appear that tasking soldiers to mine uranium in far-flung parts of our territories was less than ideal for the Black Army's esprit de corps. At the uranium mines in question, there have been reports of work stoppages, violence against supervisors, and rock-bottom morale. While we cannot ameliorate all of the problems that have led to this unrest, we can certainly crack the whip, as it were. We must begin sending new officers to the mines. Those trained in law enforcement and riot control should be prioritized. The uranium must flow, for the good of the Black Army."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_discovery_in_streltsovsk: "스트렐촙스크의 발견"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_discovery_in_streltsovsk_desc: "Far beyond our heartland of central Siberia, near the frontiers we share with the proxies and puppets of the Sphere, is the small mining city of Krasnokamensk. Much of the city's economy is based around the extraction of coal and manganese, but more recently, the mine technicians have come across something new: uranium. In the pits of the Streltsovsk Mine may lie one of Russia's greatest deposits of the stuff. Having access to this would be an incredible boon for our nuclear program. With that said, the mine is in the Far East, well outside our original stomping grounds. This would present new difficulties in mining, transport, and processing, to say nothing of potential labor shortages in a region so recently conquered. The risks of moving our nuclear program east are clear, but the potential rewards are immense."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_statists_of_siberia: "시베리아의 국가 통제주의자들"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_statists_of_siberia_desc: "The abundant resources of the Streltsovsk Mine are undoubtedly a positive for our nuclear program. However, there is one issue hanging over our heads: the Russian Far East was a warzone until very recently. While many of the civilian populations of the region have been integrated successfully, the scars of the fighting with fascists and statist communists alike run deep. We will need to act carefully in the Far East, and navigate the situation with caution."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_earn_your_liberation: "너의 해방을 얻어라"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_earn_your_liberation_desc: "There are still many thousands of captured prisoners from the conquest of the Far East in camps across the territory. Many, especially those from left-leaning factions of the conflict, have joined the Black Army, but many more adhere to various strains of fascism and White monarchism. Maintaining these POW camps is a strain on our resources, and they are a very tempting manpower pool. Furthermore, many of them would welcome the chance to earn their freedom, even if it takes digging up radioactive materials in a godforsaken speck of Central Asia. By giving these prisoners a chance to enter civilian life again, we would be killing many birds with one stone."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_pity_for_tyrants: "폭군에게 동정은 없다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_no_pity_for_tyrants_desc: "What kind of an idiot would presume that a fascist can be redeemed? There are still many thousand of the bastards languishing in prison camps run by the Black Army, the detritus of fighting in places like Chita, Amur, and Magadan. They can be put to work mining uranium, but let's not kid ourselves. They won't have much of a choice in the matter. Instead, they will be given a taste of their own medicine.\n\nThe fascists would have strapped all of Russia to the yoke of serfdom once again. Let's see how much they like it when the shoe is on the other foot."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_revolution_will_succeed: "혁명은 성공할 것이다..."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_revolution_will_succeed_desc: "Our nuclear weapons program is moving along impressively, with extraction and research efforts continuing to yield results. But it will not be enough. Not yet. For the success of the global triumph of anarchism, our coups de grace must be ready as soon as possible. More miners, more engineers, and more researchers will be tasked to the program. The success of this program will be the highest priority!"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_by_any_means_necessary: "무슨 수단을 써서든"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_by_any_means_necessary_desc: "Our nuclear weapons program has succeeded. Within a matter of weeks, we expect to have our first pure fission bomb complete and ready for testing. While it cannot yet hold a candle to the vast arsenals of America, Germany, and Japan, it would still be a triumph without equal in the annals of Russian military history. The Black Army is about to split the atom, and capture the fearful eyes of the world. Congratulations."

 SBA.1.t: "가장 위대한 실험"

His wife simply sat and observed him. "You were there right? You met Bukharin when he came to Novosibirsk, right?" Kilchichakov already knew the answer to that, a photograph of the three of them was sitting in the foyer.\n\n"Of course," His wife laughed, "I don't know how you could've missed the man, he was larger than life!"\n\nMikhail nodded for a while, letting his partner's words echo. "Do you remember the things they said about him, even then?"\n\nYekaterina was struck by the same silence that had taken her husband, "Uhm, I suppose I do. They never really had a pleasant opinion of him here did they?"\n\nMikhail's hand suddenly shot out and grabbed his wife's, prompting a gasp from her. He stared deep into her eyes, "What will they say about me, Kat? When I am dead and my economic policies have run their course, wiIll they curse my name as we do his?""

Svetlana shivered, holding herself tightly to trap any heat that may escape.\n\n"Yeah," Anton said, "good enough to justify waking up the entire village to discuss."\n\nStephan, a frail, pale man led them deeper and deeper into the woods outside of their community. A pack of fifty people followed closely behind him, not too closely, no, no one ever got that close to Stephan. In their defense, it wasn't their fault that he would stay locked inside the top floor of his family's residence, tucked away alone like a discarded toy, only the building's library to keep him company.\n\nStephan rose a hand, freezing in place, "Here. We'll do it here."\n\n"We'll do what here?" Svetlana asked, her being unfortunate enough to be closest to the man.\n\nWithout a word, Stephan blew out his candle, plunging the forest into darkness. The people sung a chorus of protest and confusion, but it was not long lived. The forest erupted in light once more and the scene before them was plain to see. Stephan had taken an old gun and stowed it away in his coat. Now it was pressed against his temple, his finger hovering over the trigger. The crowd drew a deep breath of shock, Anton muttering a prayer under his breath.\n\n"I'm a traitor. I am the enemy. I am an operative for the state. I must be punished, I must be put on trial." Stephan shifted his weight in the snow.\n\nSvetlana watched with wide eyes as the man rambled about the things he had read, how, overtime, he had begun to subscribe to the old ideas of Bukharin. He finished his ramblings with a request: shoot the man, kill the traitor. The village looked at each other for answers, dumbfounded by the situation before them. She cautiously stepped forward, "Stephan, nobody wants you to die for that. You are free to believe what you like. Your beliefs make you who you are, and we'd be a lousy community to tell you to change." Svetlana took another step forward, "Put down the gun, Stephan, let's go home.""

However, in the defense of the people, many had simply never experienced democracy, had never felt what it was like to actually have their voice heard, so meeting often would have to be excused.\n\n"I don't think there's any more debate on the matter?" Maxim Popovm, the representative from a commune to the south said, bringing the nosy chatter to a standstill. Maxim looked around from his seat, opening the floor to any new discussion. "Nothing? Good! I was getting tired!" The crowded assembly jeered in agreement, it had been a long night, though undoubtedly worthwhile. The motion being presented would be revolutionary. It would be essential. It would be the will of the people realized!\n\nThe Congress of Kansk had been designed in such a way that the Security Council and General Assembly were housed in the same room, with the General Assembly being a grand term for an unimpressive collection of benches, pews at the church of anarchy, at the far end of the room, near the doors. As one moved down the benches, they approached the six seats of the Security Council inadvertently creating a perspective of the Security Council looking down on the Assembly. That was never the goal, but Ivan Stepanov had learned to use it to his advantage.\n\n"Comrades, in accordance with recent decisions from Comrade Mishurenko and I, the current motion cannot progress in its current form."

Although the eagle watched, very rarely did something stare back, until the fat face of Veniamin entered into its field of vision. "The fuck is this? We are really using maps from the empire?" He turned around to the rest of his peers, who were similarly hunched over the yellowing map.\n\n"It's old but it's reliable, I brought pens." The man reached into his bag and retrieved six pens. "We can mark out the different communes from here." He uncapped his pen and immediately scribbled over the coat of arms of the house of Romanov, snuffing out the bird for good. "I suppose we can go alphabetically, what's the status of Berezh, Katerina?"\n\n"Less than ideal, we have been hit hard by communists to the east, ever so often, some bitter old men will cross into our land and burn it all to the ground. The Black Army has promised an increased presence but we've got nothing of the sort."\n\nThe man nodded, drawing a skull and crossbones over the commune, "Diverting from Zelenogrosk is a possibility, much of the industry there was left untouched." Thus became the pattern, for three long hours, the young Russians drew signs and stripes, painting a picture of a free land interwoven with arrows. Goods danced across the frozen tundra, springing from place to place, as the hunt for the perfect balance escalated.

You boy, you have the potential to become something great, so don't fuck it up!"\n\nFinally, the blinding white roof of the school peaked out from over the horizon, through squinted eyes, he could see the bikes of the other boys, carelessly crashed against the ground, around...something. It wasn't quite clear to him what, it looked almost like his father's truck. That was peculiar, not many kids got dropped, most were simply sent off into the tundra into the nearest place of higher learning. As he got closer, Andrey allowed his bike to coast, his mind was more focused on what on Earth a truck could be doing at school.\n\nAndrey dismounted and rushed inside, praying he wasn't late. "I'M SORRY!

Hissed his teacher, "Take your seat." Sheepishly, Andrey found his place and directed his attention forward. "As you may have noticed, we are joined by Comrade Pytor, who will be making his home here for a while." Andrey furrowed his brow, why would they need the Black Army in school?

The young man found respite in the break room chair and stirred his tea. Physically he had retrieved his pen and begun drafting his lesson plan for the next day. Mentally, he was back in the General Assembly, one amongst the rows of people tightly packed into the building. It smelled of rotting wood and sweat but felt exhilarating. He had been leaning forward in his seat, watching the fiery speaker gesticulating at the podium. His passion seeped out of him and dribbled to the floor, soaking in the floorboards and expanding outward to the crowd. Soon the creature swallowed Timofey's shoes, his whole body soon to follow. The speaker roared in the name of education, overwhelming Timofey in his drive.\n\nTimofey twitched in chair, a shiver down his spine bringing him back to the present. He looked around the simple break roam, only a table, a pair of chairs, and some tea. He wondered what made the man who spoke at the Assembly go into teaching, but Timofey had his assumptions.

Stepanov stopped in his tracks, making the general do the same, "Hope that you would support me unconditionally."\n\nMishurenko's face scrunched together in confusion but quickly softened in realisation. Mishurenko was a hero to the people but to the Black Army he was a legend, an ideal, a man who never stopped fighting.

That was until the prisoners caught word that the anarchists were coming and would likely bring freedom with them. The irony was not lost on him now. Him and the small detachment of guards had been trapped in the lobby, anarchists outside and inside. He was trapped.\n\nThe threat seemed to work, for now at least. As long as Lenoid kept his firearm pointed down the hallway the prisoners would not dare move.

As she laid in the dumpster, discarded like trash after use, she counted the ways to get justice.\n\nThe following morning, Alexandra had made up her mind. Murder would not bring her justice. Attempting to ignore the incident as her mother had done before her would not bring her justice. Alexandra refused to carry the baggage dropped on her by a stranger, a scoundrel who believed he was above the men around him, that he could decide the fate of others. He was the kind of man that would feel victorious if she allowed her rage to overcome her, if he could deprive her of the same humanity he lacked. He would not win.\n\nThe village had come to her call. Not all of them, of course. Many still within the city viewed the woman, even the liberated one, as one who existed to be housewives, to be a bearer of children. Those who stormed the home of the man who forced himself upon her were the true revolutionaries, she decided. Those who dragged him out kicking and screaming, as she was the night prior, were the men and women who would bring change to Russia. The people of the village who stood as a tribunal around the man, a fascist wanderer from the eastern realm, and sentenced him to death, had prevented the man from winning. Alexandra did not concede to rage, she had found justice in the compassion of the people."

 SBA.31.desc: ""You can bring the next man in, Comrade." Comrade Turgenev was a military man at heart. Fighting against the Whites for the Bolsheviks, fighting against the Germans for the Union, and finally fighting against Russians for Russia. Before he could read, he could shoot. It was in his blood.\n\nTwo men emerged from the double doors, one man arrived in rags, no shoes on his feet and unkempt hair. The other reflected light as he walked, the medals dangling off his uniform blinding all that were unfortunate enough to pass by. Comrade Turgenev gave the paper before him another once over. The man described in the file was a complete stranger to the man in rags before him. He had lost twenty pounds, at least. His uniform had likely been burned or kept away as a momento by a prospecting officer. Turgenev watched the pitiful march, as one man led the other, until they both stopped before him.\n\n"Comrade Turgenev, I present before you today a Red Army officer. His charges include perpetrating unjust human suffering, suppressing the native people of Mongolia, and reactionary violence."\n\n"Thank you, Comrade." The aged officer waved away the escort, his attention turned to the man before him. "You're a soldier?" The man nodded. "A good one?" Another nod. "With respect to you in mind, I'll ask a quite blunt question. Do you believe your guilty of the crimes you're accused of?"\n\n"No." The prisoner said flatly. "I have fought for this nation since I was born and I will do so until I die." Turgenev raised a knowing eyebrow, it was almost as if the man was recounting his own upbringing. Turgenev tapped his fingers on the bench in contemplation. He had committed his fair share of morally dubious acts during his service, who was he to judge a man for the same?"

 SBA.33.desc: ""Sweep and search!" Their commander called, pointing the men towards the grand dacha of Alexander Pokryshkin. Alyosha didn't really know what he was to do. He enlisted into the army only weeks prior. His training had been with an entirely different platoon. Aloysha followed the example of the, presumably, more experienced men he now served with. They had swept around the left, aiming for entrance by the back door. Catch the falcon in his nest.\n\nAloysha held his weapon tight to his chest as he crept. This was stupid, he thought, there was no way Pokryshkin was even still in the building. He looked off to the woods in his peripherals. Nothing. Wait, was that... A pale head? A bald man in the woods? Alyosha squinted to get a better look and the figure was gone. Stupid boy! He could hear his fathers words in his head. His body told him to move but his eyes remained peeled on the woods. He had taken a mental picture and was comparing it to his current vision. At the smallest twitch of a branch, his gut told him to run.\n\nA snap, someone stepping on a twig. Alyosha looked around to his squadmates, none of them heard the break. Now, his gut told him.\n\nAlyosha panted as he ran, his gun swinging wildly from side to side. No way. There was no way. As he got closer and closer, deeper and deeper into the woods, he thought of how foolish this endeavor was. His legs kept moving regardless. He came to a clearing, a small airstrip visible in the distance. Before him, a pudgy green figure, his head bald meandered in the distance. Aloysha knew he should raise his rifle and he did, lining up a clear shot. He would bag a falcon today. What a story that would be, a young recruit, taking down the figurehead of the state he despised? Aloysha told himself to pull the trigger but no bullet fired. He could see, even from the great distance between them, the desperation in Pokryshkin's running. He was fighting for his life, just like Aloysha."

Initially believing it to be a declaration of war, Zavoloko was weary to even open it. However after the letter was double, triple, and quadruple checked, it was deemed safe enough to open.\n\nThe letter was short and concise, "Meet in Kansk to negotiate union."

It was like a church, the rows and rows of benches like pews. The altar at the far end of the room replaced with a podium. The choir stayed the same, though the people sang a different song now. The communists knew their design, the old man chuckled to himself. They probably didn't realize it, they probably didn't want it, but God was with them in the building.\n\nThe leader of the Old Believers nodded in respect to the members of the Security Council as his wrinkled hands gripped around the podium. It was like a sermon, but beyond that it was a plea. A plea for peace and measured integration.\n\n"I am a Russian. I have been a Russian since the day I was born and I will remain so after I die. I have seen Russia in peacetime, unlike many of the people in attendance here today." Zavoloko swept his arm out in front of him, recognizing each member of the General Assembly before him. "The people of Oyroita are hungry, despite all my efforts to feed them. The people of Oyroita are cold, despite all my efforts to clothe them. I want a future for my people. I have complete faith in the Russian people. If the will of the Russian people is anarchy then so be it." Ivan slammed his palm on the wood for emphasis.\n\n"Above all else, I want peace for my people. I want their children to be as blessed as I am to have been born into a time of stability. Peace and stability will not come from the long end of a rifle. Educate them. Educate me. Convince the people of Russia with your words and they will stand by you forever, convince them with your bullets and they will plot your demise."

He could not wait to get inside of the city and he knew the others couldn't either. The brigade of men had been freezing their asses off for what felt like centuries and were getting rowdy as a result.\n\n"What's the fucking hold up?" One man shouted over the voices of the thousands, "Comrade Valenteev said we'd spend the night in the city and here we are losing fucking fingers to the cold!" A few men voiced their support but most kept quiet, just staring at the massive gate to the city, waiting for that glorious moment they would swing open and allow them in.\n\nHours passed and it never came.\n\nThe one dissenting man turned to tens and evolved to hundreds, snowballing quickly out of control. Attempts were made to simply break down the gate, to force themselves in, to no avail. "This is bullshit!" A soldier, drunk off the taste of revolution in the air, howled. "Is this some sick joke? March us all out here to waste away?"\n\n"I wish it were a joke, that would be less of a headache." From the entrance of the city emerged Stepan Valenteev. The brigade quickly fell silent. "Zavoloko has denied our request for integration." The sheer respect Valenteev commanded kept his men orderly as he delivered the damning news.\n\n"What are we going to do then, Comrade Valenteev?

Ivan Stepanov, savior of Russia? Ivan Stepanov, bringer of sanity to a land of madmen? Either would've been fine in his book, but those words did not pass the lips of the protesting people.\n\nIvan Stepanov sat in his usual chair, in his usual spot, in his Assembly. Galanskov could receive all the fame in glory, shout as loud as his voice would allow, be the father to Mother Anarchy, but what could he do besides that? Could Yuri Galanskov overcome the challenges of a decentralized hierarchy? Would Yuri Galanskov be willing to make sacrifices in the name of succes, of stability? Could Yuri Galanskov stop Ivan Stepanov?\n\nThe idea made him giddy, he felt like a character in a play. Shakespeare was what he pictured, but it felt more like a Pushkin play. Ivan Stepanov may have been the villain in the story but he was a character, a person to be followed by an audience, he had power. His power had only been expanded as he cornered Galanskov in his metaphorical game of chess. One motion blocked is worrying, two is cause for concern, but by the third, the Black Army and Stepanov stood atop the corpse of anarchy.

 SBA.43.t: "Commune Requests Reinforcements"
 SBA.43.desc: "Recently, we have been engaged in talks with a commune over the possibility of supporting our motion in the General Assembly. They remain ambivalent, insisting that their security remains an unaddressed concern. Apparently, their militia lacks sufficient manpower to guarantee the safety of their people.

 SBA.44.t: "Commune Requests Political Autonomy"
 SBA.44.desc: "In the Free Territory, all communes are equally represented. However, the matter of autonomy on a political level is another matter. Some communes, possessing more resources or larger populations, feel that they are unfairly constrained by others and are deserving of more freedom - in the true spirit of anarchist fairness, they claim. One such commune has approached us to ask for the increased freedoms which they feel they deserve. In return, they are willing to encourage their people to support our current motion."

The fair and equal distribution of funds is not an easy task, and it is not rare for at least a few individuals to be unsatisfied with their share. Normally this could be blamed purely on flawed human nature, but we know the communes to be beyond such petty trifles. Therefore, the commune that has approached us asking for due recognition of their needs in the form of economic assistance is only doing what they believe to be fair and necessary for the wellbeing of their people - or so they claim. Were we to demonstrate our goodwill and belief in the spirit of fairness, they would be more inclined to support us in our present endeavours."

We have made headway in establishing total economic equality between all people of the Free Territory, but individual communes remain varied in their wealth. This is a lamentable situation, but difficult to remedy. Complicating affairs further is the insistence by some communes that they require more economic autonomy to attain the very equality we are working towards. This clashes with our values, but has some practical wisdom to it, and permitting it might make them more amenable to supporting our motion."

One might think that allowing the communes their own rights and shifting the duties of governance onto them would make his life easier, but that never seemed to be the case. Mikhail found his office always filled with the sounds of fierce arguments as he clashed with commune leaders endlessly about how much material he could provide them and how many men he needed from their communes. It was a constant tug of war between him and the communes he had been assigned to protect.\n\nOn his desk lay lay a series of maps and files pertaining to some recently conquered territory that he had been assigned to administrate. Mikhail sighed as he sat up in his seat, picking up the main map outlining the new territory. Building communes from the ground up was never easy, and integrating them into the greater whole of the Free Territory was even harder. The task would necessitate yards of paperwork, and worse yet, he would have yet another communal leader to squabble with. On the flip side, the region was full of insurgents hoping to separate from the Free Territory. He could simply put the region under martial law and directly administer the new territory. He could establish that commune's elections later, and in the meantime, It would certainly make his job easier. Mikhail rubbed his eyes and pondered what to do."

Yet, these men didn't look like the other ones. They wore blue coveralls instead of those green military coats, and they didn't seem interested in taking anybody away. In fact, all they seemed interested in was putting up these big wooden poles connected by the long black cables. Vadim was perplexed.\n\nStranger yet, on his way home, he saw more men in blue coveralls putting up this big box in the middle of town, and the entire town surrounding them as they tried to connect the black cables to the big box. Every seemed to watch in anticipation of something, but what that was, Vadim knew not.\n\nAll of the sudden, a click was heard as the cable connected to the box, everyone watched with bated breath as one of the men in blue coveralls picked up the phone. With just two words, it was as if he had set a firecracker off in the crowd. The townsfolk cheered and hugged each other as Vadim looked on, confused as to the meaning of the words.

They ever teach you how to pillage a college in war school?" Stepanov only scoffed, continuing to go through the files before him. Siuda chuckled to himself and continued to flick through the millions of papers occupying the cabinet.\n\n"Found something." Said Kilchichakov, producing a manila folder. On its cover was the proud symbol of the hammer and sickle. Stepanov took the document from Mikhail and flipped open to the first page. Curriculum of The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics it read, bold and spelled in capital letters. Stepanov handed the document to Siuda who, at least, attempted to read each page diligently before Stepanov took the folder back.\n\n"You can read it on your own time, we have what we are looking for now. This along with all the other ones from the other college in this city should be more than enough for them to build an adequate curriculum."\n\n"Ivan, you're too quick to accept Soviet teachings, we can keep looking, I am sure we can find a curriculum here that suits the people's vision for the future" Siuda said.\n\nStepanov shook his head and countered, "I hate them as much as you do, Pyotr.

Today was unlike the rest, more than just the usual two members of the Council were listening intently. General Stepanov leaned forward in his seat, wheels obviously turning in his head. Pyotr Siuda, similarly, was listening intently but he wasn't alone.\n\n"We didn't even do anything! We were just walking to the grocer and he... he stopped to look at something in a shop, the owner came out and he was just shouting. He called us evil and a disgusting bastardization of the Lord's image. It was just something dumb. The guy was selling flowers and well, he loves flowers. We run the largest garden in our commune actually. I'm sorry I'm rambling."\n\nStepanov dropped his pen on his desk and shook his head. "I am not gonna force you to explain anymore. What happened to you is disgusting and should never happen to anyone in this free society." Pyotr's head swayed from side to side as he considered the traumatic experience. It was the couple's right to do as they pleased but it was also the right of the man to shout was it not? Pyotr, usually overflowing with things to say, was usually silent.\n\nLuckily, Comrade Valenteev spoke for him. "What happened to you is horrible, I could not wish that upon my own, however, I do believe it is firmly his right in this society to not only deny you service, but voice his opinion on your practices." Bickering quickly broke out between the members of the council, with most agreeing the shop owner was acting out of line, but the division spurring about whether it was his right to deny someone due to their sexuality.\n\nFinally, Stepanov commanded silence.

Mikhail said, peering over his glasses, "I am not gonna bore you with the ideological implications of your little anti-poverty, or shall I say, anti-Siuda, proposal here. What's more important to me is how you want to bring this about when I am already differing a sizeable portion of our budget to keeping your boys stocked up with the most up to date guns money can buy."\n\nStepanov leaned forward, folding his hands on Mikhail's desk, "I assure you Comrade Kilchichakov what I am offering is not only feasible but it is necessary!

I don't see why you are even here, the current system of communal self management works fine. They take the money they need and put it where they see fit, why do we even have to get involved in the whole process."\n\nStepanov scowled at Mikhail, visibly angry, but not willing to drop his act just yet, "It's important to not only myself Mikhail but to the army as well. Think about who's families this will save. Think about what they will think if the news breaks that Mikhail Kilchichakov shot down this agenda all the while accruing a not-so-small fortune."

He breathed in the cool air of the city, the city he built, that he loved, the city where it all begin. He sauntered to the gate, so many engravings on it from so many expeditions. It began to set in with him, this was real. Him, Pyotr Siuda, was forging a new Russia hand and hand with his communal brothers. It felt so...final. There was no going back now, he had lead too many armies, too many had died. He must charge ahead at full speed now, inaction now would spell the death of the anarchist movement. Pyotr pushed off from the gate and continued his walk to the General Assembly.\n\nThrowing open the doors, Pyotr saw the usual suspects, Stepanov at his desk, writing something. Valenteev gesturing to a map decorated with cities labeled friendly and opposed and Mishuernko attempting to cross out all the ones labeled friendly.

It will be hard. All good things in life are fought for, not handed to us. We have fought for freedom here but I cannot sleep at night, Comrades, knowing there is still so much work left to do."

Her snow white fur coat and crimson red lips was a sharp contrast to the suited at best and in rags at worst audience. She fiddled with the papers, smiling awkwardly to the Security Council, her pearly white teeth nearly blinding many of its members. Pyotr gave her a nod and the blonde haired woman began speaking.\n\n"Good morning ladies and gentlemen of Kansk! My name is Sofia Petrova, I was a wealthy upstart from the city of Tomsk." She paused for a second, trying to gauge the audience reaction. "My life revolved around administering my father's business, caring for my two lovely girls, and expanding my knowledge with the night classes I'd attend. All three of which were taken from me." Sofia's smile flickered for just a second, like the flame of a candle being blown on. "I am not here to give you kind folks my sob story," the woman said, retrieving a silk handkerchief from her pocket and dabbing at her crystal blue eyes. "I'm here to say there is good in the world. That not everyone in that city was evil. I have wholeheartedly accepted that this is simply the way things go! You know?" The woman laughed a little too hard to the silent audience. Sofia, not missing a single beat, continued on. "I know you are angry and that you want justice, I want justice too, but I ask you show mercy in your justice. Tomsk was pillaged. We lost everything. We are willing to not only live within this land, but love it, we yearn to experience your brotherhood. My only caution," Sofia offered a pathetic half smile, "let the people build equality, don't thrust it upon them."\n\nSofia descended the podium, her head down as she returned to her seat. She crossed her legs and put on her biggest grin, she knew in some communes they would've shot her just for saying she administered a business. All she could do was look to the members of council and await their justice."

The poor planning of Bukharin and the power hungry generals, crumpling Russia up in their hands and scattering it into the wind often receive the blunt force trauma of the blame. What so many forget due to their unwavering commitment to God is the role of the Church. On surface level, one would be hard pressed to guess the church as the root of all evil, but it wouldn't be too far from the truth.\n\nBelieving in God is opposed to the anarchist mindset in and of itself. To be a servant of God is to be in doubt of the power of the individual above all else. Those who draft the different versions of the Bible take the chance to manipulate the people's will to their own. As the centuries have passed, the word of God, if it even existed, has been twisted and mangled to the point it is hardly recognizable. A free land means freedom from all tools of the state, to which the church is just one of many.\n\nThat being said, the motion to confiscate the wealth of the church was one of brutal debate with the priest of Kansk engaging in a multiple hour long debate with Siuda over the use of the church for good and for evil."

The questions clouded the young man's mind as he climbed up to the balcony of the Kansk City Hall. This city is where it all began, where he first protested against the Central Siberian Republic's hypocrisy, where he organized a revolt, where he developed a friendship with Ivan Stepanov, a man he would've disdained. He supposed that was the beauty of anarchy, he didn't know what would come next. He certainly knew would he would like to do, but would he ever achieve them? He was unsure. He had heard reports from both the east and west, neither were promising. In the middle of them both, was the Free Territory, the safe zone between the statists. They would most certainly send their planes and tanks, but what they would falter on is their message. A person will not become a fascist or a socialist if you shoot them long enough. What changes people is words, a uniquely human trait.\n\nSiuda saw the thousands crowding the city square and he saw hope, a people who had seen enough suffering for their lifetime. They were going to decide the fate of Russia, the people before him, it was up to Pyotr to help guide them towards good. "Comrades! Those of you who are joining us for the first time and those who have followed us since the beginning, I welcome you." The people began to applaud, some chanting his name, something that didn't sit right with Pyotr. Regardless, he continued on. "Today the greatest struggle to come to Russia enters its next stage. We will face enemies who wish to divide us, to subvert our agenda and substitute their own. They wish to manipulate us, to force us back under the boot we crawled out of. Comrades, will we let that happen?" The assembled masses sang a chorus of liberation, making their stance clear; the state has no place here."

Pyotr smoothed out his suit and stretched, standing up from his seat. It was nice to have something to ground him in reality. He could barely believe how everything had changed, like a train barreling it's way down the tracks with the breaks cut. They had to run out of rail eventually right? One day the people would realize that killing everyone in a mob would not be the solution to their problems, surely. He wouldn't be the one to find out. Pyotr stepped off the train. Here he was. Biysk. Pyotr looked around for any sign of civilization, he was the only one stepping off the train after all. He had been briefed that the city was a backwater, it was his job to do his best appraisal, see what was good as is, what could be improved, and what had to be scrapped entirely. Before the collapse of, well, everything, Pyotr did the same job, just often accompanied by armed guards and motivated by a large pay. Now, he was alone, in anarchy, looking out at a bunch of sheep farmers, tasked with turning the city into a metropolis. Pyotr walked around the "city", if one could even call it that. For the most part the rural people of Biysk kept to themselves, which made gathering info difficult. He saw a bar in the distance, the only thing more common than the rail in Russia. Pyotr walked in, set down his briefcase and began jotting down his notes. Abruptly, he felt a tap on his should.\n\n"Hey stranger, Who are you?" The barkeep asked.\n\nPyotr cleared his throat before answering, "I'm just doing surveying the town! Just a little research for the eggheads in Novosibirsk!" Pyotr laughed awkwardly. Damn it, why was he being so awkward?\n\nThe woman smiled despite his nervous demeanor and said, "Well Pyotr, I hope you say good things about us, we don't get the love we deserve." The woman winked and walked away, leaving a stunned and confused Pyotr alone with his notes. He shook his head and looked back at the paper, but the words were blurred. He looked back at the barkeep, conversing with an elderly man. The two shared a hearty laugh. Pyotr swallowed and picked up his pen again, writing a simple phrase."

It's not just the Black Army that defends us, it is the people in the factories and those willing to march in the streets to spread our message!"\n\nDanil smiled politely, he didn't bother with these types. He didn't hate where he lived, didn't like it either. Like most in Kemerovo, Danil was just trying to get by. He worked at the steel mill until six, he picked up his dinner, and returned home, ready to settle down for the night and do it all over again. He didn't care much for liberation this and people's justice or struggle or whatever the buzzword this week. "Hey, I appreciate it, but I'm ok. Thank you, enjoy the rest of your night." Danil began to close the door but was stopped when the uninvited guest, quite literally, put his foot in the door.\n\n"You may be ok but how is your neighbor? Your family? The issue with cities can sometimes be apathy, I'm sure you understand that?"\n\n"Uh yeah, I mean, I guess I do but-"\n\n"What you may not understand, Comrade, is how integral you are to the bigger picture. The regimes before you saw you as a number, a line on a chart. I'm not here to bug you or ruin your night, I apologize if I have." The man pulled his foot out of the door, testing to see if Danil would close the door on him.\n\n"N-no, you're fine. I was just tired you know, got off work and everything." Danil said, leaving the door open. The man took his chance, stepping in through the door, pamphlets in hand. Danil stammered some kind of objection out but the man had already entered, discussing the opportunities before him.

The treasure Ramil sought out was worth more than any metal, he was hunting for hope. To which, he found absolutely nothing.\n\nRamil heaved a large book off the shelf and sat it down with a thud. Why had they chosen him for this? He flipped through the pages, looking for something, looking for his hope. Book no.480 was no different than the last.

On the other hand, it did mean that he had a much higher chance of getting caught and the people's justice was not likely to grant clemency to a thief, no matter how young he was.\n\nFydor swam upstream against a current of bodies, mumbling less-than-half hearted apologies as he struggled against the general direction of the crowd.

Her husband only scoffed, setting his notes from the assembly on the dinner table. He shook his head as he walked to their room, kicking off his shoes by the door.

She rubbed her enlarged stomach, the thought of her husband being responsible for the house was one issue, running an entire worker's co-op fit to challenge the industrial might of the east and west was an impossibility.\n\nAliyev rounded the corner back into the kitchen, his tie dangling loosely around his neck. "The Siberian Plan was a disaster, Anastasiya! I know you are smart enough to recognize that! It trampled workers rights in the name of security. Security, which for the record, never came, I mean just look where we are now."\n\nAnastasiya messaged her forehead, why was her husband such a brute? Not everything was an ideological struggle, sometimes the politics of a decision mattered much less then the pragmatic effects. "Aliyev...you're going to have two children rampaging throughout this house. I can't do this alone. I understand this means everything to you, it means so much to me, but not everything is a battle."

The success of the Free Territory proved that, people cared about other people. That's what he told himself as he shivered outside of the busiest store in the city he could find. He didn't acknowledge as people walked by while he struggled to set up, he didn't find it troubling when nobody stopped to inquire why he was outside a business with a table and poster board in the middle of a snowy evening. He knew that once his booth was set up, the people would fill the streets with lines, eager to contribute.\n\nHours passed, Tihomir sipped at his coffee to keep himself warm as people passed.

Stefan remained silent, only looking down. "Hey, I'm just giving you shit. Where you from?"\n\n"Novosibirsk.

Then and there."\n\nThe man beside him nodded, understanding his story quite well. "Your dad sounded like a brave man." Stefan nodded.

The document before him, so aptly titled "An Objective Analysis of the Military State of Novosibirsk", made Pyotr sick to his stomach. Mishuernko he could expect this kind of behavior out of, but Valenteev? What had come over the man that he'd sign off on a report praising Alexander Porkryshkin. Pyotr leaned back in his chair in disbelief, "Seriously Comrades, I should not have to tell you that this power hungry, this statist, this..." Pyotr searched his brain for more harsh words for the general but came up empty handed. He let out a long sigh, "I guess I just can't believe this whole thing."\n\nThe two men in his office shared a look, the two fought at every turn, yet, had settled on this appraisal of what could be adapt from the warlord state of Novosibirsk and applied to a modern, free, Novosibirsk. Mishuernko spoke first, looking straightforward and stoic, "Comrade Siuda, with all due respect you don't know the first damn thing about war." Valenteev slapped his forehead in frustration, god damn it.\n\nPyotr leaned forward, his disbelief rapidly metamorphosing to rage, "Excuse me?"\n\n"Comrade Siuda," Valenteev sheepishly interjected, "Pyotr, my hate for tyranny burns just as bright as yours. I find their methods sickening and cruel." Valenteev paused, carefully choosing his next words, "However, that doesn't mean we can't take something bad and make it good. Porkryshkin was an army man through and through and as such he left very detailed notes on his perferred methods on war, specifically pertaining to aerial combat, something we are lagging behind in."\n\nPyotr mulled over Valenteev's explanation, the two military men standing in silence before the hero of the Free Territory. Pyotr shot an icy glare at Mishuernko, "If we begin to mimic the state, will we be shocked when we become it?" Pyotr paused. "Yet, I understand your point of view. You have my green light.

The sickly man rose from his seat in the dining room and dragged himself to the frigid, poorly lit, living room. For a living room, it was quite dead. Paint peeled from the walls and books gathered mildew. If one part of the room was alive, it was the grand piano, tucked away in the corner as if hiding from the misery that devoured the room. The composer shambled to its bench and sat, his fingers hovering over the keys. His hands descended to play.\n\nA knock at the door interrupted him. The composer chuckled to himself. Very fitting. As he hobbled to the door, the man smiled, he wasn't supposed to answer but he was gonna anyways. He could see why these people rebelled all the time, it felt good.\n\n"Dimitri." Said the man at the door. He spoke to him like a child. "We know." The confidence struck a chord with the composer, making him grin. "You're proud of yourself then?"\n\n"Just come inside." The old man turned and retreated back into the house, his guest following suit. He pulled out a chair for the stranger and sat in one of his own.\n\n"Is he here?"\n\n"Who? Kamov?"\n\n"So you know why I'm here."\n\nThe composer threw back his head in laughter, "Of course you came for the helicopter. I don't know why Kamov thought he could hide such a creature.

It was Alexi's turn to roll his eyes now, not finding the same humor as his friend. "Don't believe me? Get in!"

Nearly hitting Alexi square in the face, she tossed the keys to the dumbfounded boy taking up all the good space in her garage.\n\n"Julia, come on, this is ridiculous! I mean..." Alexi looked at the vehicle and then to the keys and then back to his friend. A slight smirk formed on his face, "If you say it works.

Satisfied with his answer, Nestor rose from his seat with a grunt, pulled open the doors and walked in.\n\n"Comrade Nestor," If this was the Security Council, it had gained about a hundred or so member over night, "I hope your wait wasn't too long." Nestor mumbled something, dismissing their concern. "Well, it looks like you're in the for your...twenty-seventh appeal? Is that right?" Nestor nodded his head.

Were they so obsessed with their tools of destruction that they forgot what matters most; basic human decency? Something washed over him, he must call out this injustice, even if it was small.

From all her years accompanying Siuda, Yevgeniya knew one thing about the man, he was certainly larger than life. Her window gazing was interrupted by the sound of boots clicking the tile floor. Pyotr was here.\n\n"Sorry, Yevgeniya. Got caught up at the Congress, I hope I didn't keep you waiting for too long?" Pyotr removed his coat, hanging it up on the rack next to his desk.\n\n"Oh no, Pyotr, no need to worry, I was just appreciating the view."

There's people who have enjoyed more freedom than ever before, people who are not dreading, but excited to raise a child in this new society!

She had spent the better half of her career in Russian politics drafting the groundwork for the agency, for her agency. Yevgeniya had experienced doubt her whole life, doubt she could lead, doubt she could even perform the simplest of task, all because of her gender. Not only did this make her one of the founding members of the free Territory, it gave her a foresight like no other. The enemies of Russia were not to be found just beyond the Urals or in the port of Magadan. The enemies of anarchism were the superpowers of the world, those who sought to preserve the status-quo. To maintain a free territory, the international threat would have to be addressed first and foremost.\n\nThe board of men before murmured between each other, pointing to certain lines of the proposal with their pens. Yevgeniya broke the silence, "I trust everything is to your liking?"\n\nStepanov removed his glasses, "Page twelve strikes a chord with me, Ms. Taratuta. You write, and I quote, that the members of this agency uphold an oath to protect the continuation of the revolution at any cost. Can you elaborate on that?"\n\n"I had a feeling you'd ask, Comrade Stepanov. It is my firm belief that this organization's top priority is to assist in our crusade to liberate the people of Russia. By extension, this means safeguarding our pre-existing communes. The biggest threat in my eyes, Comrade Stepanov, from my experience in working with some of the neighboring states, is that of the international powers.

He didn't know the first thing about what happens in the far east and yet he had the nerve to talk down to her like she was some insolent child. She was ready to tear apart Stepanov limb by limb, yet her years of diplomatic experience gave her restraint.\n\n"Our very worst enemies, Comrade. The White Army, parading around on horses, touting some Tsar they've stolen from a far away land like the previous century never happened. Chairman Yagoda, who I am sure we are all familiar with, based his operations not too far from our initial base in Kansk. Not to mention literal fascists who attempt to spread the Nazi plague from the east. To say we need to focus our attention outwards, Comrade Stepanov, is an insult to all we are fighting for. We have made significant progress, yes, this is true, but all of that can be ripped away from us at the drop of a shell casing if we waste our money and resources on fruitless endeavors in America!" Yevgeniya panted. So much for her diplomatic training.\n\nLuckily, Pyotr interjected, before Stepanov could lecture her back.

 #SBA.91.desc: "It's better to have loved and lost then to have never loved at all, that's how the phrase goes. It's supposed to be inspirational, it's supposed to give a lazy bum the kick in back to do what they were always afraid of. Stepanov wasn't quite sure if he was afraid of the people. There was no confusion, he certainly didn't like them, but was he afraid of them? Did he hate them? That question was more nuanced, and certainly not the one General Ivan Stepanov pictured he'd be thinking as men and women alike kicked at his ribs.\n\nHe couldn't hear much, maybe because his head had been savagely beaten, maybe because he didn't want to. Stepanov built his head like a fortress, locking himself in and others out. For decades, that was how he lived, a constant inner monologue with himself, planning his eventual assault from the fortress. The moment he let the drawbridge down to charge is the moment his castle crumbled. He had waited so long. Put up with so much "Comrade" this and "stateless" that. Who gave a fuck? He certainly didn't. All that preparation all to hear the Security Council utter those simple words. Yet, the only thing Stepanov heard were the chants of the raging crowd before him.\n\nStepanov the general died in the Security Council. Stepanov the schemer died as the people saw through his act. Stepanov the bloody and broken would die at their hands. Siuda was saying something, of course he was, but Stepanov didn't care to listen. He chose to watch. Watch as his men anxiously hovered their hands over their guns, looking at each other for support. Shoot! He screamed at them through his eyes, do something! He felt the rope slither around his neck. His eyes softened, a command to a plea, a plea to scream and a scream to nothing."

 SBA.92.desc: "The wedding, though long planned and looked forward to by most in attendance was, as befitting the territory of the Black Army, an anarchic affair.\n\nThe brides arrived first, both on leave from the militias of their respective communes, and both also wearing matching black dresses emblazoned with the Army's sigil. Modifications in order to allow them to comfortably sling their rifles had been expertly integrated.\n\nThe 'priest' arrived second, his clerical uniform stained and submachine gun scuffed from the day's entrenchment training. And the guests arrived third, each forming up behind their commune's bride and bearing the marks of their own daily militia activity.\n\nAlthough the communes agreed on the need for collective action against enemies without, in truth there was much tension between them, put aside only enough to ensure that this special moment for their respective daughters was not interrupted. In short order, the 'priest' officiated and the brides exchanged vows, both to the Black Army and to each other, before sealing them with a kiss.\n\nCheers quickly turned into jeers, however, as with the ceremony itself now completed and the alcohol brought forward, long-standing disputes emerged once again. One guest swung at another from the other commune, who responded by dislocating his arm. The priest struck a reveller with a thrown bottle, knocking him flat. A general brawl followed, though all were careful not to use their weapons. They were, after all, allies in anarchism.\n\nAs one bride broke the nose of her new wife's cousin, she laughed in delight before helping him to his feet, knowing that they would fight together against their communal enemies for many years to come."

Unlike most days, these people included many from the militant Kostinsty Union, demanding an immediate meeting with the Security Council.\n\nThe Security Council, of course, agreed. The foreman, Vitaly Kostin, began with a carefully rehearsed speech.\n\n"We, on behalf of the workers of Central Siberia, demand that the Siberian Plan's militarization be reversed immediately now that our region is at peace and the Free Territory is not under threat. Quotas should be decreased immediately and production diverted away from the military. I'm sure you see no problem with this?"\n\nSiuda was the first to speak, "Of course not, Comrade Kostin. The people of Siberia deserve prosperity, especially after all they've endured, and I'm sure everyone here agrees." There was a quiet murmur of agreement from the room, yet Ivan Stepanov spoke over it.\n\n"Comrade Kostin, I can understand your concerns." he began, "It would be unconscionable for the Free Territory to continue this while, as you say, not under threat." Kostin was satisfied with this, the Security Council seemed to be far more receptive to the plight of the workers than the previous businesses and governments he had dealt with.\n\n"Unfortunately," Stepanov continued, "that is not the situation we find ourselves in. To the east and west, blood-thirsty warlords turn their eyes on our land. To the south, the imperialists in Japan do the very same. Even within Central Siberia the defeated statists lick their wounds and prepare to strike. Comrade Kostin, the Free Territory must make sacrifices or we will lose everything we've fought for."\n\nThis drove a divide in the Security Council. Though the Black Army had always fought for the people, Russia was a harsh place, and these values may prove meaningless if they are defeated at the hands of a despot or warmonger. But as with all motions, a decision had to be made when it came time to vote."

Stepanov and the generals were planning something, and whatever it was, she knew it was stupid.\n\n"Not at all, Comrade Kostin," Taratuta took a seat, and Kostin eventually followed suit, "I understand that you and the Kostinty Union are angry about the rejection of your motion."\n\n"Well yeah, the 'Siberian Plan' is just statist justification for taking away our rights! If you won't demilitarize it, then we won't be a part of it."\n\n"I know, and I sympathise with your demands, but the Security Council still sees the statists to the east and west as too much of a threat, if we demilitarize the plan, they'll smother our revolution like statists have done every other time in history. This is a temporary measure, I assure you I dislike it as much as you do," Taratuta seemed to have struck a chord with Kostin, and he seemed to be contemplating what she was saying when a worker barged into the room, rifle in hand."\n\n"Comrade Kostin!

But such was not the case.\n\nAnd so the influence of that Assembly had to be curtailed. By the radical action that he had decided upon. Issuing orders to the formations under his command, he had relocated his forces to the area in and around Tuva, seizing control of the region from the central government.

Regardless, he felt like puking. There was so much more to Russia than just what he saw, and he had seen a lot. Pretender kings and corporate republics, cities of art and Red Army military zones, he had ventured across the entire political spectrum just in his own little slice of Russia. He was familiar with surface level knowledge of the warlords to his east; he knew of the Tsar, the twin Vozhds, Yagoda and his greatest enemy, he was even familiar with one called The Father, a religious type who sought to synchronize the church with anarchism. The mere thought of it compounded his already miserable headache. He didn't even want to think about what was to the west.\n\nSiuda slumped down in his chair, and started absentmindedly at the map.

They spent their first night in their temporary headquarters in former-Rodzevask bickering, and their first morning standing out the entrance to the city, shivering.\n\n"I've made up my mind, Yevgeniya. I made all the arrangements as you slept last night. The vehicles are already in transit." Siuda stood with his arms crossed, facing the winding path that led into the woods, and out of what was known as Rodzaevsk. Yevgeniya sighed in defeat. It's not that he was purposefully ignoring her advice, he just knew he was right! There had to be some sort of return to normalcy in the city, to wash away the stain for good.\n\nThe distant hum of engines brought both of them to attention. There was no going back now, and after this was over, Siuda promised he would never let Yevgeniya live down her worrying over nothing. Soon, the hum turned to a rumble, and buses revealed themselves to the world. Finally, the first bus came to a stop meters away from them both. Siuda made his way to the door, and waited as people began to step off, suitcases in tow. "Welcome, comrades, welcome home!" The fascist regime had displaced and deported hundreds of Jewish and native peoples from land that had been in their families for generations. This wouldn't do for Pyotr.\n\nAn bald man was the last off the bus, walking down the steps slowly and deliberately, his thick, rectangular, suitcase overflowing with his belongings. Siuda moved to help him, but the bald man stopped him. "You're the one who brought us here, aren't you?" Siuda only nodded. The bald man gripped Siuda's hand tightly, and Siuda got to fully observe the man, his patchy skin and scruffy face. The man stared deep into his eyes, "Thank you. This place is my home. I feel safe again." With a smile, the man walked into the city, disappearing into the crowd. "

 SBA_PowerStruggle.5.desc: "The night after the first day of the Return Home project, as Siuda had taken to calling it, ended like any other. Siuda ate, revised his speeches, and took a moment to enjoy pleasant conversation with Taratuta. Her gut feeling about the project never quite went away, but she did her best to push the idea from her head. Siuda dropped his pen triumphantly, and glanced over his speech once more. He had taken to writing them at the behest of a record-keeper he met in Novosibirsk, 'important fragments of history' as she called them. "Yevgeniya, come look! This will be an excellent way to kick off our anti-fascist campaign."\n\nYevgeniya sauntered over to Siuda, and plucked the paper from his hands. "This community is healing," she read over her glasses, "returning refugees is our medicine, and tolerance is the cure." Taratuta made a face, raising her eyebrow, "Since when did you become a doctor?" Pyotr rolled his eyes as he sipped from his tea. "It's good." She acquiesced, "Might make someone cry."\n\nThe pleasant conversation was cut short by a ferocious beating on the door. The two occupants of the house froze, watching the door intently, just waiting for it to fly open. It didn't. There came no more knocks. No more sounds at all. The two looked at each other, making conversation without a word. Slowly, Siuda rose from his seat, and crept his way to the door. He didn't have a gun, but Taratuta kept her pistol close to her side. Siuda took a deep breath, and threw open the door abruptly.\n\nNo one was there.\n\nAt the doorstep, however, was a note. Pyotr snatched it from the ground and slammed the door in one fluid motion. Taratuta watched as Siuda scanned over the paper, eyes moving frantically from word to word as though he had to keep track of them or else they would envelop him. After an eternity of silence, Siuda turned to face Yevgeniya, brow furrowed in confusion. "They're just names. It's just a list of names. But," Siuda paused, "some of the names are crossed out." Siuda read and re-read the document again and again until he committed it to memory. It clicked with him then."

 SBA_PowerStruggle.6.desc: ""Order! Please calm yourselves!" Siuda stood atop a hastily constructed stage of wooden boxes in the center of the city. A crowd that teetered on a mob had amassed around him. The thing about people is that when enough of them get together, they form one body. A crowd is a separate species from a human in the way it moves and operates. The beast before him roared out loudly, demanding answers. Siuda ran a hand through his hair. Jesus.\n\n"Enough!" He commanded and the crowd fell silent. "What happened last night was a tragedy, but if we fight between ourselves, we'll obtain justice!"\n\n"A tragedy?" Shouted the beast, "Thirty people were killed!" The beast raged, "You brought us here! You led us to be slaughtered! The fascists aren't gone, we aren't safe!" The beast repeated the mantra again and again, drowning out Siuda and his futile attempts to tame the creature. The two threatened to tear each other apart, until a gunshot rang out through the town, silencing them both.\n\nAt the tail of the beast, a middle aged man of average height and build, stood ram-rod straight, his weapon pointed high into the air. "Comrade Siuda, I apologize for having to use such methods to get your attention, but I feel that what I will say is important enough to warrant it." The man stepped forward, the beast disassembling around him as he moved effortlessly through the crowd. "I was born here, but was forced into exile during the dictatorship as both my father was Jewish. My family fled all the way to Novosibirsk, to the city of promise, the oasis of Siberia. That was when I first heard your ideals, and became a devoted follower. What has always impressed me, and what has surely brought you from that city to here, is your ability to foster unity."\n\nThe man stepped closer to the stage and offered a hand to Siuda, "I go by Abakumov. I want to help you find whoever did this.""

 SBA_PowerStruggle.7.t: "A Fork in the Road"
 SBA_PowerStruggle.7.desc: "One week and two days after Pyotr Siuda and Yevgeniya Taratuta first arrived in Rodzaevsk, the town had been turned completely upside down. The process of denazification had become an obsession to Siuda, and even his worst enemies could credit him for being a man of firm ideological conviction. The desire to blot out the last remnant of Russian fascism consumed him. The trip to Rodzaevsk was only meant to last five days, before he was set to travel to other parts of the East, but the days blended together as the townspeople he had taken under his wing grew more and more paranoid that at any moment, the killer, or killers, could strike again.\n\nAbakumov had made a name for himself as the town's sheriff, though he renounced the title. He was able to effectively bridge the gap between the population who still held Siuda in high regard, and those who saw him to blame. Abakumov, under the advice of Siuda, formed the Emergency Anti-Fascist Committee. A board of five individuals, none of which were Siuda. For once, he found himself in the crowd, rather than in the assembly. Taratuta, however, had been chosen, and essentially acted as his voice on the committee.\n\nThe committee had been planning for days, strategizing for defense, and following dead-end leads. Though Siuda desperately wanted to help, the popular will was against him here, despite his best intentions. He could only watch helplessly as neighbor began to accuse neighbor of being the Ghost of Rodzaevsky, as the terrorist had become known.\n\nWhile preparing for yet another day at the committee hearing, Siuda received a transmission over the radio. "Comrade Siuda!" Came the relieved voice, "This is General Valenteev. I'm in Irkutsk, or what will be left of it. Entire army units have split into factions, the military apparatus of governance is completely crippled. Moreover, some of the Union bureaucrats have taken this opportunity to attempt to regain power through subverting our systems and popular resistance. I can't do anything, the situation is completely out of control. If we lose control over the power supply here, we could be without electricity in major cities. We need you out here urgently." Siuda sat by his radio, stunned to silence. No matter what he chose, the answer would be wrong."

 SBA_PowerStruggle.8.t: "Off I Go"
 SBA_PowerStruggle.8.desc: "Siuda stood, arms crossed, looking out over the city. Thousands of kilometers away, to the East, Yevgeniya and the town of Rodzaevsk fought their own battle. Despite his desire to sleep, he couldn't shake the feeling that what he was doing was wrong. He was never one to start a project and not finish it, now wouldn't be a good time to start. Even with that in mind, what else was he supposed to do? Sit idly by? A good Anarchist always respects the people's will, and the people chose to be rid of him.\n\nIrkutsk reeked, that's what he noticed first. As Siuda made his way down the main avenue, accompanied by his recently increased security, he finally saw what most did when they pictured anarchy. Shattered glass peppered the streets, fires raged inside of buildings, and it was evident that the sanitation system had been completely abandoned. Unnerving, but not necessarily damning. Siuda had been to actual warzones, where battles were being actively fought, and the urban decay hardly came close.\n\nSiuda stopped at the gate to the presidium. Before he and Stepanov set out East, scattered like dust in the wind, Siuda had already designated many landmarks as possible prime locations for local assemblies. The presidium was the crown jewel of them all, with an assembly there, it would be clear that the Soviet system has been usurped by that of the anarchists. Siuda knocked twice on the door, paused, and then once more. On cue, the door swung open, and Siuda and his guard were ushered inside.\n\nThe presidium was far from the jewel promised. The windows had been boarded up, and entire wings of the building had been repurposed to house people. The many rows of tables, once occupied by the Union elite, were filled by three men and two women, whose quiet discussion died out as the door closed. General Valenteev, surely a sight for sore eyes, rounded a corner just in time to come face to face with Siuda. "Comrade!" He exclaimed, "I didn't expect your arrival this early but I'm glad you're here. We've got a lot of work to do.""

Firstly, the Black Army had splintered into two different factions, as Siuda had heard they had done in Tomsk as well. This was a non-starter. If the armed forces could not effectively fulfill their duty to uphold the common order and protect the community, anarchism would never get off the ground. Secondly, the lack of political foundation, partially caused by Siuda's trip to Rodzaevsk, meant that the educated elite were able to manipulate the people into simply democratically electing to restore the Supreme Soviet. Finally, the people don't care.\n\n"You're on blocks A, B, and D." Siuda commanded a bustling army of soldiers, civilians, and slackers, "Remember, we're working with limited resources. Ration food carefully, but without being frugal." As people swarmed all around him, sectioned off into roles that best suit their talents, Siuda could only watch as a stupid grin crept across his face. A night's worth of planning had turned the survivors to community leaders. After some time, the relief effort began to run itself. Food was delivered on time, repairs were conducted all throughout the day, and the workers of the sanitation system returned to their essential duties.\n\nSiuda crept out through one of many doors, and elected to take a look around the city. It had already shown the signs of improvement, beneath the rubble and the carnage, Siuda could start to see it as the Paris for which it was."

From one end of the building to the other, Siuda was truly alone. As he wandered between the twisting hallways, it made him long for Yevgeniya. She always knew what to do. Even when he could not find it within himself to believe that he could do what was right for Russia, she always could. Siuda could only wish the best for his friend, and wonder what she was up to.\n\nThe question would have to wait. When Siuda finally returned to the main hall, he heard the first indication of life, and peaked out the window to get a handle on the situation before having to face it himself. The city center was split into six roads which coalesced at a fountain in the middle. Endless rows of people lined each street, carrying signs, children, and weapons. Siuda squinted to get a better view of the different groups. The kaleidoscope of ideologies, branching out into a circle, ranged from the easily identifiable followers of Yagoda, still waving the banner of the Union, to those supporting ideologies Siuda wasn't even sure he could define. This situation was untenable, and the hard work done to repair the city would be for nothing if it tore itself apart again.\n\nEveryone in Irkutsk had gathered in the small section of town, necessitating Siuda to force his way to the front. Finally at the fountain, it became clear what was going on. Representatives of the six factions had met to lay out their demands. One of the representatives saw Siuda and sprung from his seat, jogging over to him. "You, you're Pyotr Siuda!" The man swung an arm around him, "You're just in time, you can save this!" Siuda wasn't quite sure what he was supposed to be saving, but the brewing conflict didn't seem appealing to him at all in the slightest. Coincidentally, Siuda made eye contact with General Valenteev, as he too fought his way up through the belly of the beast."

No less than two hours after the call for soldiers was sounded, men had started to appear over the horizon. Those two hours, however, were excruciating.\n\nGeneral Valenteev ducked back into the crowd, squirming his way towards the presidium, and to his radio. Siuda, once again, was alone in a sea of bodies. This wasn't his home. This wasn't Kansk. These people were not his neighbors or friends, their politics were not related to him in the slightest. The realization struck him, then. There was much more of Russia, and a whole world, outside the frontier of the Free Territory. For a second, his idealism faltered.\n\nThe protests had largely died out by the time the Army arrived. People just…went home. Got bored. Siuda felt dizzy. Now, he had used the Black Army for nothing, and opened the door for him to use the Army as a crutch whenever he got in a tight spot. Valenteev returned to congratulate him on handling the situation well, but the victory felt hollow. It felt as though he was incredibly close to resolving the situation peacefully, and making a working agreement for the city, but had recused himself from the negotiations entirely and waited for the military to bail him out. Soldiers began to set up shop in the city, and although there was no doubt they would bring stability and justice with them, the harsh glances from the city's residents mitigated any of the positivity it could've brought.\n\nSiuda climbed into his vehicle, resigned to return to Kansk, carrying home with him a failure in Rodzaevsk and a Pyrrhic victory in Irkutsk. "Hello, Pyotr." Siuda immediately recognized the voice as that of Taratuta's. He saw her in the back passenger seat and climbed next to her. "I hope things went better for you than they did for us.""

Siuda shrugged, and smiled to the man, "What can I help you with?"\n\nSiuda had come to know the names of the six representatives rather quickly. Each group wanted something of the other, as is only natural during negotiations, with Siuda acting as the mediator. As the chants from the people grew louder all around them, the six men struggled to iron out a deal that left everyone happy, and the city intact.\n\n"Well that's the point of an assembly," Siuda explained, running off of minimal sleep and diminishing hope, "each person gets one vote. If you turnout, your vote will count, simple as that. There is no way to maintain a system of anarchism with parties." Debate erupted as the six men stumbled over top of each other to prove why the statement was true. Whatever they were trying to accomplish, it clearly wasn't working. Siuda massaged his temples intensely, trying to work out the migraine that grew and grew. The stomping of feet and constantly repeating chants made Siuda yearn for the Black Army to simply intervene, to create a path and let all six protest groups march as they chose and everyone could go home.\n\nThree hours had passed.\n\nBy then, the chants had died out, and now, the negotiations were more an exhibit, or rather, an inverted zoo. Six crowds, six beasts, stood around the seven humans and watched as they murmured and mumbled. Finally, one of them stepped back, resigning from the endurance test they had undertaken. Eight minutes later another did too, and one more, and two more, and then it was just Suida and one other. "You've made your point clear on politics, and it is apparent your mind will never change and your opinions won't budge. That's fine." said the last one standing. "I cannot, though, allow your economic policies to drive this city, and Russia at large, into the ground. There must be some compromise here or there will be no choice but to organize a general strike." Siuda, exhausted and eager to return home, learned an important lesson,"

For that, he was commendable. His first mistake though, was trying to force an anarchist to abide by the rules.\n\nSiuda slipped out of his door and into the dead of night with nothing more than his fur coat wrapped around him. He wasn't even sure what he was hoping to find. A clue? Footprints? A giant neon sign pointing him towards the individual or group behind the attack? Any would've been nice. Instead, Siuda got the freezing rain, and pitch black city. This was stupid, he decided, come on! He turned on his heel, looking back to the trail he had made, and tried to fit his foot perfectly into the holes. When he couldn't fit into the first hole, he paid it no mind. When the second didn't, it was cause for suspicion. When Siuda looked up and saw that the footprints led the opposite way from which he came, he knew.\n\nSiuda crept to the outskirts of the city, towards the tall trees that the buses, those damn buses, had entered from. The footsteps led further north, and Siuda followed closely behind like a loyal dog. Without explanation, the footsteps stopped. There simply were holes, and then there were not. Siuda inched closer to investigate and as he did, he heard the most peculiar sound. The ground beneath him meowed.\n\nSiuda shook his head, clearly he had lost the plot, men didn't vanish leaving nothing but footsteps behind them, and the ground did not meow. Siuda shifted his weight to make his way back to his residence when he heard it again. A meow. Siuda furrowed his brow and looked all around him, but no source could be found. He stepped, and he heard it again. Siuda's eyes became wide with the realization; a cat could be buried in the snow! He began frantically wiping away at the thick layers of snow, until he found it."

The members of the committee exchanged glances that conveyed emotions between concern and frustration. "I know it sounds stupid, but I'm not kidding! Look, you'll believe me when you see this," Siuda bent down to the ground and brushed away the freshly fallen snow. Just beneath it, a wooden door, akin to one attached to a cellar, revealed itself. "I haven't opened it, the people here have entrusted you all with this responsibility, and I do as well. Whoever killed those people is behind that door."

The people seemed happy enough, their faces dotted with wide grins and exhilarated joy, some even on the verge of tears as the monument to their oppressor was cast off with a bang, only dust in the wind.\n\nHowever, some in the crowd didn't seem all that impressed, no, they seemed angry that they had dared defile the monument to the Vohzd and all he stood for. He could see them, weaving their way between the crowds as if just another batch of elated spectators, their expressions betraying their ill thought out disguise. And as he raised his hand, pointing wordlessly into the crowd, the soldiers beside him understood, stepping forward to question the new arrivals."

 SBA_PowerStruggle.19.desc: "Magadan was always a bit out of the way, even for a Siberian city - and this time of year, it was certainly frigid. Pyotr Siuda wouldn't've found himself here under any normal circumstance, but he was in the area, and word had gotten up that an American cargo ship had just come in a day ago, recently after the liberation of the city.\n\nStepping down paved roads towards the docks, an elected officer by the name of Burakh shadowed Siuda. His men had been watching the cargo ship that had docked itself in one of Magadan's jetties. By a ramp leading to the deck of the ship itself, a pair of soldiers stood next to what Siuda could only assume was the Captain of the cargo ship. He looked up as Siuda approached, and even looked a little relieved to see him.\n\n"Finally," the Captain grumbled in a thick accent. "Are you in charge? Should I get a translator?"\n\nSiuda stopped in front of him. Immediately, he spoke. "Translator? No. No. No need," He said, English tenuous.\n\nThe Captain blinked, bushy brows furrowing together. "-well, alright. We've got foodstuffs, warm clothes, lotsa' supplies for the winter here…" He explained, while Siuda nodded along. Pyotr stole a glance with Burakh, trying to hide a mischievous smile that began to creep onto his face. Siuda whispered to the young officer, murmuring an order - and just like that, Burakh peeled off, starting to marshal his men. The Captain watched as soldiers in dark uniforms started to march by.\n\nSuffice to say, the Captain had grown more than a little suspicious. His eyes narrowed. "You are - you are the-"\n\nSiuda cut him off. "Yes," he responded, not even giving the Captain a chance to respond. The American looked over his shoulder as soldiers started to swarm the decks of his ships, working together to lift boxes and cart them down towards a forming crowd. The Captain looked as if he was about to protest, as soldiers broke open the crates and tossed the goods inside to beckoning civilians. Looking back at Siuda's face, and the guilty smile wrought upon it, the Captain concluded one thing."

Passing workers, men and women alike, some with children in hand, start to cluster up  to be in earshot of Siuda's microphone. He wasn't nervous. Pyotr had done this many times before, but he couldn't remember the last time the crowd in a place like Kansk was so dour.\n\nIn the months since the liberation of Irkutsk, the city had undergone changes under the communes. Ripping out the ugly facets of Yagoda police state took time, and instability had grown rife as the local administration hammered out the kinks. Gripping the edge of the podium, Siuda cleared his throat and held his head high as he began to speak.\n\n"Comrades of Irkutsk!" Siuda's voice boomed. "It has been some months since this city has been liberated from the clutches of the old Union's withering hands, and the Presidium toppled. The tyrant Yagoda - a Mussolini painted red, who would've seen you all monitored and controlled like obedient slaves by his NKVD, has been cast down and justly punished for his crimes. Now, more than ever, the future of Irkutsk looks ever brighter."\n\nSiuda's voice had all the charisma, the fiery quality that inspired rousing cheers all over the Angarsk river basin, but that day, it fell on deaf ears. As his eyes scanned the crowd, faces twisted into sneers, frowns - or worse yet, remained blank expressions, as if they weren't listening at all. Siuda gulped.\n\nPerhaps they were too used to Yagoda's iron fist - like cattle, or men in the cave who had seen only the shadows. Siuda could blame them, but something deep down within him, something etched behind those weary faces, told him that it wasn't their fault. As much as it turned his stomach to admit, Yagoda's regime brought security that the Black Army hadn't. Not yet - although, it would.\n\nEasing it back, Siuda felt his chest empty of breath. The fiery plan for his speech dissipated. He didn't know what to say next.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he glanced upon the crowd again."

The auditorium was packed full of people - native Buryats, young soldiers wearing tattered uniforms, mothers and fathers, huddled close together and looking up at Siuda, on stage.\n\nFor the last hour or so of the town hall, Siuda had been doing well in answering the questions. The crowd was receptive and understanding, perhaps softened to the free nature of the Black Army by Sablin's policies. There were the standard questions about how everything'd work, what their new schedules would be, how their farms would operate, but - Siuda had done this before, in countless other cities. He didn't think Ulan-Ude would be any different.\n\nA young woman, near the front of the crowd, raised her hand. Siuda pointed her out, and her chirpy voice filled the auditorium.\n\n"What do you think of Comrade Sablin's past policies - and will yours be a continuation of them?"\n\nAnd for the first time in the first Ulan-Ude town hall, Siuda grew silent. His eyes affixed on the woman who asked that question, and for the first time, the crowd watched the man visibly contemplate a question.\n\n"Comrade Sablin," drumming his fingers against the wood of the podium, "-a man of fierce ideological conviction. His message of liberation was admirable, but that much power should not sit with one man." The crowd stared at him expectantly, but - what more could Siuda say, without complimenting a statist? Granted, he was one of the better ones.\n\n"What about Comrade Sablin's education and literacy programmes, for our female comrades?" Another voice called out.\n\nSiuda cleared his throat. "I can assure you, we will be continuing these policies, if not even expanding them." His dance around the topic of Sablin seemed more precarious by the second.\n\n"What did you think of Comrade Sablin himself!? He wasn't so different, was he?" A third voice called out.

Looking up, Siuda raises his voice slightly to travel through the wooden door.\n\n"Come in!" The knob turned, and the creaky hinges gave way to a stout man wearing thick winter furs above the raiment of a religious man. Coarse gray hairs hid a ruddy red face from the cold, and he trails in soft powdery snow from outside. "Comrade Kain! Sit, sit," Pyotr urged.\n\nFather Kain had a smile on his face as he settled into a stiff wooden chair across from Siuda's small desk. Out of the ice glazed window, Black Army trucks lay parked next to each other, beds being stocked full of goods and supplies to be travelling north to Omolon, Sakha, Kolyma - where Father Kain travelled from to see Siuda.\n\n"Father Kain, please. I'm but a humble servant of the lord." Siuda's eye twitched - but, the Father was an agreeable man, even more so for coming to see him like this. "I came to give you my thanks, Mister Siuda - all across Sakha, I hear talk of your goods getting to the tribes. Enough food to last us through the winter - we cannot be grateful enough," Kain nodded.\n\nSiuda smiled. The affirmation of the tangible good brought a warmth to his face that was enough to fight off the cold outside. Kain continued.\n\n"Such charity is - the love of God and man, manifested uniquely in you and your helpers, Mister Siuda. God bless you."\n\nThe mention of God again made Pyotr's eye twitch, and a certain funny feeling rose in his chest. He tensed up, shoulders coiled, but looking at Kain's happy, bearded face quelled such emotions, his hands slowly lost the taut tension in them as he relaxed himself.

Responding only with a grunt, Kilchichakov entered into Siuda's home. "You can leave your coat wherever you please." Siuda walked back to his kitchen and sat at one end of the table. A few moments later, Kilchichakov joined him.\n\n"You'll have to excuse me if my cooking skills aren't what they used to be, I've been out for a while." Siuda said in between bites.\n\n"Yes, I've certainly noticed your absence, and I'm sure those in Tomsk did too." Kilchichakov spat. "Though I suppose it isn't fair to blame you for that." The room became quiet, save for the soft sounds of chewing. Eventually, the economist dabbed at his mouth with his napkin, and cleared his throat. "While I appreciate this gesture, I doubt that it's purely out of the kindest of your heart, though I suppose it wouldn't be out of character for you." Kilchichakov conceded once again. "I've been in the game long enough to know that people invite me over when they need me, not when they want me."\n\nSiuda set down his fork, and prepared to meet his challenge. "The last time I saw you in person, comrade, was in Kansk. You stopped me on my way to an assembly meeting and told me I had to fight to find a recruit." Siuda leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms, "And I realized then I was wrong about you." He paused to let his words take their effect, "I thought you were a businessman. A capitalist. Your prowess with the economy convinced me of that. For that, I thought you were heartless, my greatest foe. But when you asked me to find that boy, I saw humanity. I saw that you aren't a bad person." Siuda leaned forwards towards the table, "There'll come a time, sooner than later, where you will find yourself on one side or the other."\n\n"You're threatening me then?"\n\n"No, no," Siuda laughed, "I know you'll make the right decision, the decision that brought peace to that mother, and the decision that'll make it so it'll never happen again."

Optimistic and curious, but above all else, hopeful. She saw that hope in the eyes of the children that had formed a semi-circle around her. The Tomsk Public Library had graciously accepted her offer to showcase her proudest achievement; a children's book. The city had been scarred by the reaction to peaceful demonstrators ordered by Stepanov, but the joy of children could heal any wound.\n\n"Ok children!" A slender woman's chipper voice bringing the children to order, "Today, we have a very special guest reader, Comrade Taratuta! What do we say to her?" A chorus of children responded with a thousand different answers ranging from greetings to expressing their desire to go to the bathroom. The woman smiled at Taratuta, rolling her eyes, "Ok! Ok, let's calm back down. We're going to be very quiet, and very respectful while she reads, ok?" Various indications of agreement came from the hoard of children. With that, Taratuta opened her storybook, and flipped to the first page.\n\n"There once was a mouse named Georgy. Everyday, he woke up, and made his way to school."\n\n"Mice don't go to school!" One child cried, "I've never seen a mouse go to school!"\n\nTaratuta smiled through the interruption, only a child would see the need to correct a fantasy. "Ah, but this is a world where they do!" The response seemed to placate the child and Taratuta was free to continue. "One day, while on the playground, Georgy had bumped into Fyodor, a huge dragon who used her size to bully all the other schoolchildren. 'Give me your lunch, little mouse!' Fyodor thundered. Georgy was scared! Fyodor could swallow him whole! Georgy reached into his backpack to hand over his lunch, when another student ran up beside him.\n\nTaratuta licked her finger, turning the still stuck together pages, "A girl he knew from class ran to Georgy's side, 'Stop!' She said, 'Why does she deserve your lunch? That's yours!' The girl turned to Fyodor, standing at the foot of the dragon, 'Just because you're stronger, doesn't mean you get to push us around!' The scene had attracted the attention of many of the other schoolchildren who joined her, standing beside her. 'You may be able to pick on us alone, but together, we are stronger than you!'" Taratuta gently closed the book, and smiled back at the children. "

The typically stoic General Valenteev couldn't help but laugh. "And, and, and," Siuda continued, "She asked me if I liked it!" Siuda made a face of disbelief, "Do I like it?! So what do I do? Tell her no? That it's the most disgusting thing I've ever laid eyes on? I had to tell her I loved it! I still have it in my suitcase!"

He knew his flight left in the morning, knew that there was so much work to do, but yet it was far easier to pace. And so he did. He paced. And paced. And paced.\n\nStepanov woke up three hours before his departure, the blank page continuing to mock him. Damn it all!

He stood, arms folded behind him, and looked over the not-yet awake city. This was his domain. This he could handle. But far off in the horizon were many more obstacles to overcome, adventures to see to completion, and legacy's to lay. Stepanov could not help from smiling, that's why he did it.

The usual routines of his neighbors were not in full swing, not on display for all to see. There was no smell of morning cooking. There were no children preparing for school. There was no life in the outskirts of Tomsk. Yet, a ferocious beating came from the town square, contrasted sharply by a mellow orchestra.

The protest was quickly organized, if it was even organized at all, and men, women, and children alike stood side by side with nothing more than their fists and their resolve and they knew they would lose.

One is from Kansk, I know that much, said his father met Siuda, I mean Comrade Siuda, I'm sorry, personally! Anyways, another, the other guy, said something about a lack of resolve, how his father had served with Comrade General Stepanov and-"\n\nMishurenko raised his hand, bringing the frantic boy to silence. The night was quiet again, only the low wind indicating that the world continued to turn. The old general looked back west, towards all he fought for, and considered his situation carefully. He was well aware of the friction between the boy and Stepanov, but now, it was spreading to the Army. He would be damned if his work to return to home was stopped by petty politics. Mishurenko put a hand on the boy's shoulder, and looked him square in the eyes, "Thank you. I will deal with things from here.""

 SBA_PowerStruggle.32.desc: "To: General Ivan Stepanov\n\nAs the most senior elected officer in the Black Army, I have seen many people come and go. You will recall that I was one of the first to attach myself to this movement, and I have spent those years since wondering if I made the wrong decision. As we froze in the Assembly Hall in Kansk, decades ago now, I watched as you built a kingdom around yourself, a Tsardom in the anarchy. I took notice of your actions, admittedly first falling victim to your tricks. For some time, I believe you were just as committed to this as Pyotr.\n\nBut as we grew out, expanded from bandits to statesmen, I saw you for who you were. You are a general, not an ideologue. Perhaps I am reading you wrong once again, but I believe there comes a time where we have to show our true selves. Last night, a fight broke out between two of my inferiors, torn apart by the politics you and the boy preach. It was then it was clear to me that you have grand plans for Russia, plans far beyond visiting the Far East out of goodwill.\n\nAs a military officer myself, I am perhaps biased in my decision on which horse to bet on in this race, in this struggle for power, but I believe I can lend you some valuable advice. What you have done to the Army and to the people of Russia at large is appalling, and still, I believe the worst is yet to come. However, it is in your best interest to know that you command plenty of respect, and you do not need me to tell you how much power you wield, but will never match the boy in terms of public popularity. I have led countless campaigns all across the carcass of the Union, and I have not once met a man equal to Pyotr Siuda in charm, nor resolve. If this is a battle you intend to win, you must drop any pretenses of winning on the battlefield of words.\n\nRumors have begun to spread in your absence and in Siuda's. Your misguided decision regarding the city of Tomsk speaks to this point. There have been whispers of further rebellion in Kemerovo, though I am unable to substantiate them. Likewise, I have gotten word from a contact in the Amur region that Siuda is to make a stop there in the coming days. This would provide a perfect opportunity to remove the issue once and for all, simply rid yourself of the boy then and there. I cannot tell you which decision to make, but I will say, if you intend to govern as a strongman, you must act like one.""

 SBA_PowerStruggle.33.desc: "Stepanov had read and re-read Mishurenko's letter over and over again. He paced, and read. As he laid in bed, he read. As he shook hands and laid the foundations of connections essential for a soon-to-be dictator, he repeated the letter again and again and again in his head. If he were to be a strongman, he'd need to act like one. The phrase echoed in his head, thrashing around wildly, denying him sleep, peace, and efficiency. As had become habit, after returning back to his temporary residence in the former Imperial Palace, Stepanov stood on the balcony, and looked out into the city, searching for the answer.\n\nHe hated himself. He had always been cool and composed, and a single letter had reduced him to an indecisive mess. Of course, that was only a persona, but he hoped that if he faked it hard enough, it would become him. That word had come to haunt him; indecisive. Everytime he thought he had successfully excised it from him, it came back. There were only so many times he could walk back and forth in his room, or lie wide awake in his bed, and push the issues out of his head. It became an attack on his pride. Mishurenko, the elderly and forgetful general, had the nerve to tell Stepanov what to do. Who does he think he is? Stepanov knew the answer to that question of course; he was someone who was right.\n\nStepanov looked to the east from the balcony, somewhere, Siuda was out there too. Instinctively, his hands had curled into fists. If he didn't do something, the boy would run Russia into the ground, leaving behind a legacy of weakness and rubble. There had been plenty of opportunities to kill the boy in the past, but none seemed right, everytime he hesitated, not out of friendship, but out of fear. Stepanov did not care for Siuda, but, in his heart of hearts, he was terribly afraid of him. The moment Stepanov became aware of that feeling, that Siuda could win, he knew what he had to do. The boy would die, and he would reign. He wasted no time in devising a plan, drafting a plan for his most dedicated and experienced men to await Siuda on the outskirts of his destination, while Stepanov returned to Central Siberia so as to provide himself an alibi."

 SBA_PowerStruggle.34.desc: "Pyotr Siuda sat bored in his vehicle as it traversed the Russian landscape. The denazification project he had undertaken in what was once Rodzavesky's domain had been a resounding success, even if there had been one significant thorn in his side. Ahead of him, the vehicle carrying his personal guard bounced up and down against the terrain. To his rear, two other vehicles followed closely behind, one carrying Yevgeniya and other aides, and behind them the supply truck. Tired of being tired, Siuda leaned forward from the back seat, "Comrade," Siuda addressed his driver, "Are we still on track to be in the city before midnight? We had planned to set up shop overnight and get to work right away in the morning."\n\nHis driver nodded, "Yes." Siuda smiled, a man of few words! He seemed to attract people like that, perhaps to compensate for his abundance of them. Content, Siuda leaned back in his seat, and let himself drift off to sleep, exhausted from his busy schedule.\n\nBefore his eyes opened, his head hurt. Siuda had found himself on the floor of the vehicle, sprawled out and face down. He could hear the engine roaring, and felt the sharp turns of the vehicle threaten to throw him around like a schoolyard ball. Gripping his seat tightly and pulling himself up, Siuda saw the earth move quickly around him. His brow furrowed as he looked out the windshield and saw no lights ahead of him. Siuda's brain began to race, almost matching the speed of the vehicle, was this a kidnapping? No, surely not, the two vehicles behind him would never allow it. Once more, Siuda leaned forward to the driver's seat, "What are you doing?!"\n\nEyes still focused on the road, the driver spoke calmly, "The vehicle ahead of us was ambushed," The driver took his hands from the wheel to exaggerate his point, "men swarmed out of the woods, they had rifles, like this." The driver mimed holding a firearm. "We have to get you out of here." The driver returned his hands to the wheel and continued full speed ahead. Siuda leaned back in his seat for the second time, processing the situation. This wasn't a bandit attack, it was an assassation attempt. Although it was no secret many people wanted him dead, only one person had the resources to pull off an attack such as this one."

That would mean that in one hour and thirty-five minutes ago, it would be twenty four hours since Pyotr Siuda was killed. Stepanov took deep, long, breaths. This was a good thing, he told himself. This was the decision of a strong man. After the thousandth time, he almost started to believe it, and the anxiety he felt started to slip away.\n\nFrom his seat next to the window, Stepanov saw the expanse of Russia beneath him. Now, there was nothing in the way of his power play. He had already rehearsed his speech, that while working together with Siuda in the integration effort, a rogue member of the Russian Fascist Party attacked Siuda's vehicle, and Stepanov barely escaped with his life. The wheels turned in his head of just what would be his first move after taking Russia for himself. Dinner sounded nice.\n\nParanoid about his decision, Stepanov had demanded a report on the assassination as soon as it had been carried out. From the back of the plane came a soldier, a single sheet of paper in his hand. "Comrade General," he saluted, "I just got word from the men on the ground regarding your..." the soldier cleared his throat, "operation." The man presented the paper to Stepanov, who took it, and waved his hand so as to dismiss the soldier.\n\nStepanov hastily scanned over the document. Tracing the words with his finger as he read, Stepanov jumped between important words. Ambush. Siuda. Skirmish. Escape. Failure. Stepanov froze for a second on the final word, failure. Siuda had escaped unscathed, and more than likely clued into Stepanov's plans. Ivan tore the page in two and crumbled each half in his hands. He should've known there would be no easy solution for this problem. Assassins had failed him, but he wouldn't fail again. There was no other choice but to be a strong man now."

My dad was literally there when Siuda told Rurik that he wasn't going to kill him." Ivan, walking beside him, only rolled his eyes, as if. He was gullible, sure, he had fallen victim to a few pranks, but he wasn't stupid. The town didn't even look like a kingdom! It was shabby, there were no monuments to a king, there was no fanfare of a court, it just looked like the rest of Russia. "You still don't believe me?" Alexi asked, facing Ivan, "You will. The warehouse we're heading towards is supposed to be filled to the brim with old stuff from the kingdom. Guns, uniforms with the crown on it. You'll see."\n\nWhen they finally arrived at the warehouse, the sun had begun to set. Their elected officer had organized the company into two groups to cover each half of the facility. To Alexi's chagrin, the two were paired together, and began to sift through the boxes. Finding nothing of substance, Ivan stood triumphantly. "Told you. There's nothing here that proves there was ever a kingdom. I mean come on, you have to be a special type of stupid to thin-"\n\nWithout warning, the warehouse had turned pitch black. Conversation died out immediately, and silence fell over them all. For a moment, Ivan was sure he had gone blind, but only a moment later, the lights sprang back to life. In the center of the building, armed guards stood in a circular formation around a man adorned by a great, flowing, fur coat. The tension in the air was palpable, as confused glances were shared by the Black Army soldiers. "This is an illegal search," The man bellowed, "and a clear violation of the people's rights. As such, a militia has surrounded the building to ensure the integrity of our belongings. All armed soldiers will depart from this area at once." Ivan turned to Alexi, eyes wide and fixated on the man he recognized as Prince Yuiry. The Prince's back was to Ivan, and the two were in such a spot that they were unseen by the guards. Ivan's breath became shaky, and he looked to his firearm. Something came over him, something he could not control. He wrapped his trembling hand around the gun, aimed,"

Then, he heard, one by ten, by hundreds, as the reality of the situation set in for them. The Prince, one of the last links to the Rurikid dynasty, joined his sister on that warehouse floor.\n\nAlexi pulled Ivan down onto the cold floor in an instant. Alexi's eyes were wild, and his voice was hushed but frantic, "You shot him!" He panted, "You shot him!" Alexi repeated the phrase over and over again, but Ivan could hardly hear it as the sound of gunfire rang out all around him. Ivan kept his eyes wide open, afraid that if he closed them again he would see the Prince again. Alexi grabbed his shoulders, still flat on his belly, "You shot him, Ivan! Oh my God!" They didn't need to look to know that a massacre was taking place, but Ivan could not help but poke his head up and over their hiding spot. He saw the door in which they entered, the door to the outside world where this assignment was boring only minutes ago. The Prince wasn't bluffing. More men rushed in, loyalists to the crown, or to the city, and just as they came in the fell.\n\nFor an eternity, the sound of gunfire and the smell of death hung in the air, smothering oxygen and keeping the two young soldiers firmly in place. Multiple times, the sound of firearms ceased, only to begin again, this time more ferocious. Finally, though, it let up for good, but Ivan didn't stand. Alexi did, however, and wept."

He yelled in a whisper, "Jesus! You were going to shoot him? Are you trying to get us all killed?" Ivan struggled to find the words, stuttering out some sort of explanation that he was just trying to defuse the situation before it began, and he was only following training, and he had never been in combat before, and a million other excuses that clogged his throat.\n\nThe elected officer had stepped forwards, hands off his weapon, and begun to quietly converse with the Prince. "We are just investigating a claim that this building is being used to house weapons and ammunition to bring down the Free Territory. We are fully within our rights, under clearance of the Security Council, to investigate and destroy pro-statist rebellions before they spring up." The officer stepped closer to the Prince, eliciting a reaction from his guard, "If you, and the people of this city, have nothing to hide here, there is no reason to point weapons at us."\n\nThe Prince shook his head and responded sternly, "You brought down this kingdom in the name of liberty and now you will trample on it for the possibility of safety?" The Prince crossed his arms defiantly, "The ultimatum is the same."\n\nAlexi turned to Ivan, "See, I told you I wasn't lying, there really was a kingdom here." Alexi and Ivan watched as the officer and the prince exchanged remarks for what seemed like forever. Ivan had regained some of his composure but couldn't shake the feeling that he could've done something horrible. As they sat and waited, and waited, and waited, the soldiers on both sides grew more comfortable. Still on edge, but the slightest noise would not trigger a massacre. What they were all oblivious too was the growing number of civilians outside the warehouse. The Prince wasn't bluffing. By the time that the officer had stepped away from Yuiry, they had been outnumbered by the town's people and had no choice but to accept the Prince's demands. One by one, the soldiers filed out of the warehouse, empty handed, and marched out of Kemerovo in shame."

Soldiers occupied a building, and when the community stood up against this blatant overreach and display of disregard for the values of anarchism, the Black Army stood in opposition to the people. Though the full story has not yet been discovered, it is speculated that the Army arrived, occupied, and opposed the people off a flimsy rumour of weapons smuggling. As we await further news ro trickle out of Kemerovo, we ought to take a step back and question why incidents such as these happen more and more frequently.\n\nWhile I think some have always been suspicious of the power of the military, those individuals have been vindicated as of late. I encourage you to recall your memory of the latest assembly meeting you attended. How many guards were there? Then, think of the meeting before that and ask yourself the same question. With Comrades Valenteev and Mishurenko on opposite sides of the Free Territory, and Siuda and Stepanov in the East, the Black Army has been left to babysit us while Mother Anarchy and her many grooms are out.\n\nThe skirmishes in Tomsk and Kemerovo prove one thing, even if the Black Army has turned its back on liberty, the people have not. This pressure must be applied continuously and universally, squashing all facets of authoritarianism where they arise. What will you do when hundreds of soldiers march into your town? Will you stand up, or will you sit idly by as freedom dies. This state dressed in all black can not masquerade itself as an anarchist society.

As the hulking metal doors slammed shut behind him, Pavel awoke from his dream. The Imperial Palace was not a home, or anything like that now. Now, the palace was a graveyard. Empty. Save for the two last occupants. A peasant and a pretender.\n\nBehind him, Pavel could still hear the cheers and the echoing boom of the comrade General's speech, and could still smell the ash of looted artwork, propaganda leaflets, and bodies burned. The view in front of him wasn't much better. The body of a man, crumpled and discarded like worthless scraps of paper, lied contorted on the ground, the remains of his glasses dangling from his face. If it were not for the subtle rises and falls in his chest, the man would be indistinguishable from a corpse. Pavel offered the man a sad smile. It was disturbing, but it was right, right? That's what he was supposed to see, he was a soldier, an anarchist!\n\n"A peasant." The soft voice from the man below him brought Pavel out of his trance. "They've sent a peasant to dispatch me." The man laughed, a laugh that quickly devolved into a cough, and then to a weeze. Pavel watched in silence as the heap of a man began to take shape, and rose to his knees. The two met eyes. "Aren't you? You are not noble. You are a boy."\n\nPavel took a deep breath, and felt his hand drift towards his side arm. He was right. He was just a boy.\n\n"What have I done to deserve this? To die on my knees to a peasant? The rest were executed before the people, backdropped by roaring speeches and displays of military force!" The pretnder's words echoed out throughout the hollow building, prompting Pavel to draw his weapon and plant it against his prisoner's forehead as instructed, "This is not justice, nor liberty.

The brief illumination offered Stepanov a chance to truly observe his surroundings; snow, trees, and snow and trees. The only sign of civilization came from the dilapidated hovel before him. Incredible, he scoffed, what special breed of idiot would fight for this? The press of rubber against snow became audible as the light emanating from behind ceased to be. Stepanov took a deep breath, surely taking in more frost than oxygen, and adjusted his cap. This had better be worth it.\n\nBefore he could even reach the entrance, the door swung open, and out hobbled an elderly man, clearly missing an eye and certainly missing brain cells. "General!"

I'm sure you are less than enthusiastic about that. I don't imagine he's there to erect a memorial to the late Vozhd."\n\nThe old man flashed a devilish grin and let loose a hearty laugh. "Just as enthusiastic as you are, General!" The old man plopped into a wooden chair, hardly able to support his weight, and gestured for Stepanov to do the same. "Scattered around you is my life's work, every single document regarding the Russian Fascist Party, it's members, operations, invaluable information for someone seeking to set up shop in this neck of the woods."\n\nStepanov gestured his hands outward, "So you said in your letter. I hardly believe this is a gift of goodwill from a fascist to a man such as myself. What's your catch?"\n\n "What do you think? I want what you want!"

It had been a simple task, another brilliant scheme to undermine the assembly, Siuda especially, in this particular instance. He was promised extra pay, so he had taken it.\n\nStepanov, in all of his combined genius, had suggested that he travel to Olomon, a rather determinedly religious region in central Siberia, and decry the anarchist as vehemently atheist. Ivan had laughed in the confines of his own thoughts when that was proposed to him, but the deathly serious look upon his commander's face made him reconsider the hilarity of the idea.\n\nThis was all in the past of course, right now Ivan was surrounded by infatuated locals, a nervous lilt in his voice as he rambled on and on about the demented evils of the anarchist and his hatred for god and his teachings. He had never expected it to go so well, but had nevertheless continued onward in his quest for Stepanov, fabricating and exclaiming as much profound knowledge on the atheist leanings of anarchism for all of Olomon to hear. \n\nAnd as figures in the crowd stared up at him, nodding in what he could only assume was approval, Ivan silently released his breath, exhaling with great relief."

 SBA_PowerStruggle.46.desc: "Amidst the columns of marching men, the thunderous booms of the band, and the cheers of loyal citizens, a very apathetic General Ivan Stepanov stood, the marching of boots setting the tempo of his pounding headache. Though outwardly he put on his best stoic look of valor, he was tired. His eyes, half glazed over, weakly drifted from person to person, meeting only the bare minimum required of a leader. How does Siuda do it? Always chipper, optimistic, and quick to unleash a tirade of horseshit. A thought crossed his mind, even for just a moment, that perhaps this wasn't worth it, that maybe he wasn't cut out to lead. Mercifully, a tight grip on his shoulder expelled that thought from him.\n\n"Comrade General!" Thundered a deep voice, "It is an honor to meet with you!" Stepanov snapped to attention, quickly drinking in the situation. Before him, a ginormous bearded man stood, built like a tree stump. Behind him, men just like him stood in a V-formation, branching out from the biggest and the burliest. "You are a subject of much respect to us, especially in this city." Ah, the memories came flooding back to Ivan, the protests. How he wished he was just as quick to forget.\n\nExtending his hand out to the soldier, Stepanov found his footing in politicking once more, "The honor is my own. Neither of us would be standing here if the mob had had its way with the city." Stepanov turned back towards the city square, towards the radio tower which marked the final destination of the siege of Tomsk all those years ago. "The situation was difficult, and only the best could've handled it as you did." Behind the General, as if on cue, stepped forward two men with thick wooden boxes in tow. The boxes flipped open, revealing dazzling medals. Stepanov plucked one from its container and pinned it to the man's chest."

Mishurenko uttered coldly, his arms crossed flatly across his chest.\n\nStepanov nodded as he drank from his glass, "Ah, I should've suspected. I take it you still haven't smoked then?" Mishurenko simply shook his head and kept his eyes fixated on Stepanov's. In turn, Stepanov raised an eyebrow, "Something nagging at you, general? I believe I'm familiar with you enough now to know this behavior, this silence, is unlike you."\n\n"What are you doing?" Asked the aging general, "Is this some sort of attempt to court me to your brewing coup?"\n\nStepanov flashed a cocky smile, "I won't insult your intelligence, general, it's no secret that the winds of change have only grown more ferocious. Though I must dispel the rumor of a hostile takeover." The room fell to silence as Stepanov calculated his next words, "Androniy," Stepanov steepled his hands across the table, "do you remember what I said to you, all those years ago, in Kansk? About loyalty? About our similarities?"\n\n"Do you remember what I said in my letter?" Mishurenko spat the words, letting them fly freely across the table, "I am not your dog." Stepanov opened his mouth to speak but was silenced. "Don't think for a moment that you have pulled the wool over my eyes once more. Your schemes have sown factionalism and distrust among the Black Army. It's no secret where your loyalties lie, General Stepanov." Mishurenko turned away, "And the same is true for myself."\n\n "I'm not asking for anything but your support. I want to bring the Germans to heel, I want revenge, I want justice." A devious grin crept across Stepanov's face, "I want you to smoke again."\n\nThe old man's face scrunched together as if the words he had been fed were spoiled and rotten. He rose, and looked down upon the fat General sitting at his desk, "You may think that you're the only thing keeping this project together, but you're wrong. The time after the boy is gone will be tumultuous," Mishurenko turned to the door, wrapping a wrinkled hand around the knob."

Stepanov slammed his fist against his desk, deepening the indent made from prior bearings and electing a flinch from the other men in the room. Stepanov ran a hand through what was left of his hair, "Continuously, I provided the most detailed instructions for the most simple plan, I gave you all the necessary supplies, and you've left him with nothing more than a few scrapes! Ridiculous." Ivan collapsed down into his chair.

Stepanov shook his head, "I just don't understand how this happened, and I've already had that journalist, Astayfyev, hounding me, now they'll starting asking how I," Stepanov pounded his fists against his chest, "the man responsible for security let the highest ranking elected officer nearly die."\n\n"Perhaps," chimed in chapayev once more, "we could shift the blame towards Siuda, portray it as an attack by a radical-"\n\n"Stop." Stepanov commanded, "dealing with you makes me yearn for Mishurenko, at least he follows through. I've already planned for what I'll do." Stepanov rose from his seat and began to pace between the ends of his office, "Let's say, one of those ideologues from Buryatia turns up dead. Suicide. Now, if he left a note detailing his plan to revive the light lit by that sailor, that should do well to divide Siuda and the closest group he has to an ally." Stepanov plopped back into his chair, no longer fuming but rage still bubbled beneath the surface, "You've removed any chance of snubbing out the strength behind Siuda's words.

 SBA_PowerStruggle.50.desc: "It had not been two minutes, and Stepanov had already begun to hyperventilate. His clothes and uniforms had melded into one towering mountain that if his pudgy hands could climb, would let him see clean across the Urals. Were his hands really that pudgy? He looked down at them and then up in the mirror, and down, and up, and down, and up, and down, and up and he saw it! A caged animal confined behind an ever shrinking cage. He screamed, a blood curdling plea for his life that one could never imagine originated from the scheming general, a man of poise rendered helpless as he fought for the clothes to get in the fucking bag. They wouldn't.\n\nFrustrated as a child is after hours of attempting to pound a square toy through a round hole, Stepanov felt tears well in his eyes, and as he went to wipe away the moisture he caught a glimpse of his pudgy hand, and his blood pressure soared. He plopped helplessly on his magnificent bed, stolen from the Rurikid palace, stolen like everything else he had. And he sobbed. From his bedroom balcony, he could see them all, their faces, that rage he instilled in them through his actions. General Ivan Stepanov, had been reduced to a blubbering mess, and it couldn't get any worse.\n\nThe shrill scream of the phone temporarily snapped Stepanov out of his emotions. The phone, his lifeline to the outside world, rang off the hook, and for once in his life he was relieved to hear it. Stepanov sniffled, wiped his eyes, and ripped the phone off the receiver, "They're here!" He cried, "There here! Siuda, and thousands of them! I know why they're here! They've come to kill me!" Stepanov panted heavily, waiting lifetimes he did not have for the voice at the other end to tell him it would be ok. And when the voice came, and it was his secretary, just calling to remind him that she would be on leave, visiting family, Stepanov reacted violently, throwing the phone back into its cradle.\n\nStepanov shambled to the window, where he saw he was surrounded. No scheme. No plan.The game wasn't fun anymore. Russia wasn't worth it, he would resign, give up, fold, whatever! But it wouldn't be enough to satiate the angry mob he had weaponized against countless others. Stepanov took a deep breath, gently unpacked his escape bag, and sat on his bed, facing the door, ready to receive the prize he had earned."

Siuda had a grin plastered across his face, he couldn't help himself! The campaign through the Far East was tumultuous, but he felt confident that he had left the area better than he found it. He shoved his hands deep into his pockets, and walked through the snow under the lights of the city. Behind him, his shoes left a trail, a path to follow. Siuda kept his head high, and his eyes forward.\n\nIt wasn't fair. It was cheating. It was wrong, but it was the only way for him to win. A thick, gloved, hand wrapped tightly against Siuda's face. His eyes threatened to bludge out of their sockets as the realization set in. He squirmed, effortlessly, against the superior mass of his assailant. He kicked, and thrashed, and attempted to scream for help, for his life, but he made the mistake of trusting the city, of thinking he was nothing more than one with his people. Another hand joined the one around his mouth and applied pressure to his throat. It was then his eyes began to water and no more than 30 seconds later, they closed.\n\nTwo sets of footprints became one. The husk of Russia's greatest visionary was lifted from the ground and thrown over his assailant's shoulder and together they walked. In Kansk, the beating heart of the revolutionary movement, where Pyotr Siuda and Ivan Stepanov made their agreement that would forever change Russia, anarchism died.\n\nIvan Stepanov, satisfied with the culmination of his life's work, walked in the opposite direction. Though as he heard the truck come to a stop from behind him, and the thud of a body being discarded in the back, he couldn't help but smile. It really was that easy."

He was stripped off all his possessions save for a singular lantern, radiating a dim light. Above him, a pale white eye watched him from a black, starless, sky. Without direction or purpose, Pyotr stumbled forwards. The forlorn forest swayed in the frigid wind but Pyotr's hair remained still. The air sung a song, a call. It was inviting! It felt like home! It felt...good. The shaking stopped. Suddenly, he existed outside of the elements. Snowflakes made their home on his skin, refusing to melt. This was good! He laughed as he dropped the lantern. Pyotr kicked snow into the air and danced around as the ice crystals fell to the ground ever so delicately. He spun and twisted and jumped, frolicking deeper and deeper in the woods. The song of the forest grew louder and louder as Pyotr's grin grew larger and larger.\n\nThe song stopped. The great celestial body watching over him blinked out of existence. The forest was now black. It was more than black, it was a void. It wasn't simply a room with dull light, it was the destroyer of light. Pyotr's laughing trailed off as the cold impacted him once more. For years, Pyotr stood in the destroyer of light. Without warning, the trees ignited into flame. Pyotr began to scream, he began to claw at his skin. It was so hot! Too hot! Its hot! Pyotr began to melt, his skin pooling at the ground. Its hot. its hot. hot hot.\n\nFrom the ashen corpse of the woods, a single tree grew and on its lone branch dangled a body. Fat and round, the body shook amongst the flicking flames. "Pyotr." The corpse thundered, "You child. Look what you have brought to this forest. Teeming with life. Now look! LOOK!" Pyotr had no eyes to look but he saw.\n\nPyotr jerked himself upright in his bed, panting heavily. He looked around his room, as it was before he closed his eyes.

I understand you're torn" She placed her wrinkled hands on his chest. "We've come too far now. You have to speak to them, I know you will. You will always do the right thing, Pyotr. You aren't him." The phrase struck a chord with Pyotr, his face twitching slightly.\n\n"Thank you, Comrade Taratuta." Pyotr pulled the coat tighter around himself as he moved for the door to the balcony. Pyotr gripped the doorknob, before he even stepped out, Pyotr could hear their cheers. They sung his name, demanding to see Comrade Siuda, defender of the revolution against the snake general, Stepanov. Pyotr took in a deep breath, turned the knob, and stepped out into the brisk morning air.\n\nPyotr nodded politely as he waited for the roaring applause to end. It felt different. This was the treatment fascists received and Tsars envied. Why was he here? The answer was in the admiration of the people below him. They chose him. They trusted him. Pyotr was not to let them down.\n\n"Comrades!" He called, "Today we pass the second test! With our combined might, we toppled the authoritarian states of Siberia! We have left them battered and bruised, yet, we must remain vigilant. It is time to build our own anarchy, free from the state inside and out of our territory!" Pyotr found his footing, continuing to rally the people to his side as he laid out the core message of the anarchist movement.

They had the nerve to look her in the face and tell her it was for her own good.\n\nThe vehicle stopped abruptly, smacking Irinushka's head against the steel. She winced in pain but did not yelp. She had not said a word since they took Pyotr. If this was the people's will, so be it. She wasn't a people then, she supposed. The door before her slid open. Two men, stood there, many more behind them with guns. They said something about Magadan, about liberation, about work. Irinushka simply smiled, just behind one of the men she could see the ocean."

 SBA_LibSoc.12.desc: ""You may utter your departing words." Barked one of the members of Comrade Siuda's task force against internal statists. Shura muttered the words under his bread in unison with the man holding the gun. How many times had he said it? Held the rifle? Taken the shot? How many times did he go back to his home after exterminating his enemies, wash the blood from his hands, and make passionate love to his wife? The number, if it even existed, was unknown to Shura. His career was to kill and to act like he'd never see the end of a rifle himself.\n\nHe could try and say something witty, maybe exercise a quip or two he had been saving. He could try and say something depressing, maybe get the executioner to flinch, that was a victory right? In truth, his experience taught him that last words, no matter how meaningful or impactful, meant nothing to the bullet torpedoing towards him. He remained silent as the soldier before him cocked the gun. He pointed it at the head of the kneeling man before him and fired.\n\nShura embraced the bang of the rifle, but something was wrong. The executioner must have lost his balance while aiming. The bullet lodged itself neatly in his chest. Against his best judgement and his own personal will, he screamed. He let out a visceral scream from somewhere deep inside him, previously hidden. Maybe it was the scream of all those he had killed before, bottled up inside him and now set free. Without warning, another bang came."

Yevgeniya Taratuta somberly said, toying with her side dish.\n\nHe spun his utensils in the air as he chewed. With a gulp, Pyotr spoke once more, "You know, Yevegeniya, I prefer to eat with guests." She nodded. "I invited Stepanov to my own home so many times. He sat right where you did. He ate my food and looked into my eyes. He called himself my friend."\n\nYevegeniya set down her fork and looked at her friend with pleading eyes, "Pyotr-"\n\n"No no, Yevgeniya, let me finish. He told me he knew how to eliminate our enemies and we sat here and drafted our plans." Pyotr thrusted his fork into the table. "He looked at me and told me what to do and I did it." Pyotr grabbed Yevgeniya trembling hand, "Tell me what I need to do. I feel as if the Security Council will be the thing to haunt me for years to come.

It was time that it be abolished, for good. No longer would the Black Army be at the beck and call of officials that could not be held accountable for their actions. Before they could stage some kind of "coup" against Siuda and get themselves killed. Nobody would object. It was obvious that their time in the spotlight had come to an end. Now, the Black Army would serve our Comrades.\n\n"Assemblymen and women, I motion for the immediate abolishment of the Security Council. It has served its purpose and it's members have been loyal, but no longer must we have a central organization commanding such a powerful army."\n\nThe assembly nodded in agreement.\n\n"All in favor?"\n\nThe vast majority of hands went up.\n\n"I think this is settled, then.""

Quickly, he stuffed his hands in his pockets, fiddling with the paper in one and the knife in the other. He took a deep breath, it's fine, it's going to be fine. Sacha began to hyperventilate, it was not fine. He saw how the Black Army swept through the east with the brutality of a people scorned, they wouldn't spare any sympathy for him. The people were looking at him again. Sacha stopped in his tracks, he nearly walked right past the office.\n\n"Afternoon, Comrade. What brings you in?" The general called from across the room. the mans back was to him, he was deep within a filing cabinet. Sacha pricked himself with the blade in his pocket. He had orders.

It was so large, Siberia, although one could find populated cities dotted around the land, there was so much empty. So much potential was how he put it, years ago, standing in the Kansk assembly hall. Yevgeniya nudged him, shaking him free of his thoughts. Pyotr looked to her and gave a wider smile, "You flatter me, Yevgeniya! You could teach these people just as well as I could."\n\n"Sure I could," she patted his leg, "But they don't want me Pyotr, they want you." Pyotr's stomach churned at the statement.\n\nStepping off the truck in the middle of the Iskitim commune, Pyotr was not greeted by the usual suspects. People did not rush out to meet him, chant his name and sing his praises. No, instead, the commune carried on as it always did, only few even recognizing Comrade Siuda. Pyotr could feel a smile forming, it was so rare just to see anarchy in action. To see people go about their days as they wanted to, no restrictions or commands from a central authority. Yevgeniya had to ruin it. She called the people around them, asking for their attention. A small crowd, mostly just people curious of the commotion began to grow around him. Pyotr bit his lip to keep his smile in place, duty calls, he supposed, this was only the first commune of many he'd visit. He had a long month ahead of him, undoubtable, but if he got to see anarchy in action at every stop as he did here, it might just be worth it."

Why not fund evenly, even in smaller towns? Focusing the limited funds they had on larger cities would only widen a diminished rural-urban gap, when distributing it to smaller towns could give them a much needed boost. Less densely populated communes could grow rapidly with just a little boost. Big cities didn't need even more money to flow into their bureaucratic money-holes."

Of course, the simplicity of these roles left a lot to be desired, as anarchists and men of many different political orientations flooded the Novosibirsk Commune Opera Hall for a night of good-natured debate. Siuda sat in the back of the hall, watching the debate unfold and duly noting the good points made by both sides.\n\n"I understand the Nazi mindset, sir, I really do. But I do not understand how you can support the actions of these men after they have murdered so many, and left so many innocent dead in their wake?"\n\nThe fascist gave a smug smile and replied. "Would you kill for freedom? For anarchy, as you call it?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"As would I for my freedom, national liberation. Some will die, but if it means a racially pure utopia, then it is ultimately worth it."\n\n"Every death? Every child?"\n\n"Every child."\n\n"And, sir, have you considered that perhaps race is but a construction? That nationalism is but a lie cooked up by your ancestors?"\n\n"Ah, I see you have the mindset of a Jew. Only a fool would deny that certain nations are more superior to others.

He traced a downward slope with his finger, "Look here, the general trend of our military industrial capacity has been steadily sliding since we cast away capitalism. It's foolish to disregard the system that brought America from humble colony to preeminent superpower on the basis of ideology."\n\nThe packed assembly hall began to throw insults at the speaker, men rising from their seats to heckle their perceived opponent. Pyotr Siuda quickly scribbled something into this notebook, underlining it thrice. With a slam of his palm against the podium, he called the room to order. "Now now, Comrades you will convince no one by demeaning them." Pyotr leaned against the podium and turned to the man to his right, "Now Comrade, you make valid criticism of my argument, I acknowledge that. However, I have traveled far and wide around this territory and have seen the impacts of capitalism. Let me tell you something, capitalism works for those who made it, not those who live under it."\n\nPyotr's contemporary had his retort and the revolutionary had his own.

So when presented with a full list of the funding and resources needed, multiple representatives jeered on and yelled for the timid scientist to get off stage.\n\nA vote must be held in the end, though. Two motions had been proposed: provide the scientists with all the resources they needed, and hopefully see a bomb done better and quicker, or give them partial funding and resources.

Whether it is statists and fascists, or anarchists themselves, it seems that we must kill the vanguards of a state to achieve lasting anarchy. And I was considering this unfortunate conclusion when I realized it was not from the loins of death that anarchy emerges, but from the fear of death. When the statists fear catastrophe, they will leave us to our own devices. When the statists fear the ultimate destruction - nuclear hellfire - they will leave us to our freedom.

Pyotr liked to think that if he wasn't a revolutionary, he would be an author, or maybe a poet, he wasn't quite sure. Though he wondered if one could separate ideology from poetry? Was not each poem, each story, an insight into the author? A window for others to peak inside of, but never to answer?\n\n'Freedom Has Been Found; The History of the Russian Revolutionary Movement.\n\nPyotr scribbled out yet another title.

How was he going to make himself make sense to others if he did not make sense to himself?\n\n'Comradeship.'\n\nShort and simple. The title seemed fitting. Pyotr thought of the most influential works of the last century, the books that brought the world to its knees. Mein Kampf, Imperium, The Communist Manifesto. That's not what his book would be.

In Anarchy Square, a small crowd was gathered. Usually, Anarchy Square was home to the occasional snake oil tradesman or men on the political fringe, the homeless and the mad. This time, some combination of all of the former was on stage. As Ivan Stepanov stepped up to the microphone, the scaffolding below him creaked.\n\n"The tyrant, Pyotr Siuda, has died in imprisonment!"\n\nThe crowd murmured and shuffled. Stepanov had accepted a warmer reception.\n\n"I have brought together leaders of the many congresses of Siberia together to discuss the march of Anarchy past the legacy of Siuda. With the Black Army's guiding hand, I will insure Novosibirsk and beyond the promise of liberty! The end of statism!"\n\nStepanov spoke at length of the virtues of anarchy and of the sins of Siuda to an audience that was all-too-careful to applaud. It would take a while to truly snuff that spirit of rebellion. Once he was finished, community leaders stepped forward to the podium. Their words were triumphant and proud, yet the tone underneath was fearful. Politicians were great actors only when a gun wasn't pointed at their sorry heads. Each one shuffled on and off, lavishing Stepanov with kind words and pretending as if Siberia was still free.

And the whole town just took it like they'd never grown anything in their lives. One officer, in the middle of handing out some bread to some children, spotted Leonid watching. The soldier shot him a flawless smile and waved to Leonid.

The snowpack had meant that the doors were shut tight, and half a day of digging by hand was required just to clear the way. Much of the town slipped through, huddled together, and began discussing the issue of the day.\n\nThe harvest had been poor that fall, and some families up north didn't have enough food to last the winter. A larger farm to the south of the hamlet was saving food for any Black Army patrols that passed through the town, but after realizing how dire the situation was decided to set aside most of it for the family.\n\nThe exact deal was hashed out, handshakes were made, and everybody got plenty drunk. After all, the night was cold and the vodka was warm. It began to feel like a party. Someone even brought a balalaika, and just as everybody began to dance, a shot rang out. Not a mile out, some hunter far from the forest, but in the barn. A man held the gun above his head, and as everyone figured out who exactly shot it, they finally realized who that new citizen was. Not a citizen - not even a local. By the accent he drunkenly spoke in, he was from Novosibirsk. To frightened ears, he was able to slur out a few words.\n\n"No-one will be, ah - sharing food - without express permission from the Black Army.

That was, if it hadn't been rolled into a cigarette yet. Each one had memorized the message by heart.\n\n"Bring your leaders to Novosibirsk. There, Marshall Stepanov and you will decide the fate of the free territories."\n\nAnd so they came in droves, as diverse as the means they employed to get themselves there. Some short, tall, white, indigenous. It was quite possibly the largest Congress in the free territory's history. An old convention center was poorly cleaned; a long table was stacked high with fresh buns. The members took their seats, the doors closed and reporters kept their ears on the doors, trying in vain to hear something coherent. No one was allowed in or out.\n\n"Was that a horse?"\n\n"Did I just hear a gunshot?"\n\n"A baby crying? In there?"\n\nBy midnight, most had given up in their search for knowledge.

So curiosity struck Novosibirsk when a small protest did break out in Anarchy Square. This was a different kind of protest, though. Instead of arguing for further economic measures, they argued for political freedom. It was the first time they had to do so, being given total freedom before Stepanov came to power. Now, all across Siberia, theft took place and freedoms were curtailed. In the north, valuable timber was floated down the river for firewood on the front. Horses and tractors were seized; they were needed for efforts "to develop the region". The best wheat in the south was taken in the south for soldier's rations. Some outspoken communal leaders began to disappear. It seemed that all that the Black Army had been founded on was gone in a scant few months. Freedom was no longer free.\n\nThat is not to say that the Black Army was about to fire on a group of peaceful protestors. Stepanov was statist, not stupid. For now, he could watch as resistance simply faded out and the Black Army began to show the people what freedom really cost. No longer could they sit idly and fail to contribute to freeing Russia.

Put your name on the paper and hand it to the poor sap who has to inform his commune that they will not be receiving any additional reallocations. However, what set him apart from the average pencil pusher was that while some men lamented the very concept of currency, Kilichakov found solace in it. He enjoyed his job, something Stepanov was very much aware of.\n\nExiting his office out into the brisk Novosibirsk air, Kilichakov was greeted by the leader of anarchy, Ivan Stepanov. "How do you do, Mikhail?" Stepanov said with a grunt, rising from the bench he was sitting on. "Why don't you join me for a walk?"\n\n"You know, Mikhail," Stepanov said as they strolled around the block, "I don't know how numbers work. I'll be honest, I really don't."

Stepanov could've been sound asleep and still Mishuernko would rant and rave about the importance of service to destroy the Nazi threat. He leaned back in his chair, watching as the aging general hung up a crudely drawn map of Europe beyond the Urals.\n\n"This," Mishuernko said, circling the heartland of Russia occupied by the Germans, "Is the ultimate goal. The reclamation of our homeland is the most essential task before our people. So long Russians have writhed in agony under the boot of Hitler, we must free them at the earliest possible opportunity."\n\n"I couldn't agree more."

Riding in on a horse, proudly waving the black banner; it would cement Stepanov's rule for years to come.\n\nMishuernko dug through his bag for yet another map, but while he was searching, he made an off-hand comment.

Valenteev wasted no time, throwing the car into drive and speeding towards the commune.\n\nThe commune was rural and small, Valenteev knew, but it was abnormally quiet. He cautiously made his way to the church, keeping low and his firearm at the ready. He could see men, dead, on the floor from the window. Fuck! He was too late. Unless the girl managed to hide while the village dealt with the bandits? Valenteev entered their church, his finger hovering over the trigger.\n\n"HELP!" The girl called out, "PLEASE GOD HELP US!"

The cigarette wasn't locally produced, not out of one of those shitty tobacco farms outside of the city. This was a real American smoke, Virginia made. When he inhaled the smoke, for just a fleeting moment, he doubted that communes could never be successful. After all, if some capitalist plantations in Virginia could make this, what did that say about a few Russian nitwits toiling in a "workplace democracy?"\n\nThis thought was interrupted by the ring of his telephone (not such a luxury, an old Red Army telephone.) Picking up the telephone, Stepanov heard an unfamiliar voice, in an accent from Moscow. Probably fled after the war. He spoke with a quiver in his voice.\n\n"Sir, I speak on behalf of Marshal Valenteev. The marshal kindly requests you stand down and cooperate in the restoration of Anarchy.\n\nStepanov considered his options. Either he was to give in and perhaps lose his life in a Siberian prison, or he was to stand in defiance of Valenteev. And if he stood in defiance, who knew what lay in store? So he picked up the phone and stood in defiance.\n\nVelenteev heard the phone ring and his heart skipped. Could this be it? The moment where for once, they won? They could stop fighting and pushing and rest. Rest, for once, no more stressing about statism or despots or death in the name of life. Just rest. He picked up the phone and his heart skipped again.\n\nHe wasn't prepared for this response. He hadn't thought he would be called on his bluff. He didn't have the men, the money, to fight a war.

It had to be today or it would never happen.\n\n"Comrade Stepanov, you still have not explained what happened to Comrade Pyotr Siuda. He was under your protection, his disappearance has concerned a great many in this Assembly." The words snapped Stepanov back to reality, as he stared at the many faces of the Assembly, all staring back at him intently, waiting for an answer. He looked at his notes, a long speech decrying Pyotr, pointing out his many failures and general lack of intelligence. Claiming his 'disappearance' was that overzealous child's own fault. But that wasn't Stepanov's style, it never had been. "Comrades." Stepanov grinned as that hated term caused a sea of disgust among those in the Assembly "I don't have to answer for the tragic fate of comrade Pyotr. Because as of this moment, this Assembly is disbanded." He pressed a button hidden underneath the podium.\n\n"Comrade Stepanov, what is this statist madness?"

"It is regretful that such drastic actions have become necessary." He lied "But the General Assembly has constantly shown itself incapable of managing the Free Territory. The Security Council will do just fine without you. Now if you'll cooperate with these soldiers as they escort you out of the room, we can help ensure this transition is peaceful and orderly.""

 SBA_Despotist.13.desc: "Life was never perfect. It was hard, toiling, deadly, and most of all, short. But in Siberia, in those wastes, it was a step closer to perfect. The work was difficult, mucking barns and sowing seeds. Out there, though, it was beautiful. It never ceased being beautiful. The slow, meandering delta. The chilly wind on a summer morning, the biting cold in the winter. The snow capped mountains just peeking over the horizon. Every day was rich, unchanging, blowing like the wind. He could live like this forever.\n\nThey came at night, in a big, rumbling military truck. They rolled right up to the door and in their big boots marched to it and started knocking. It never stopped knocking. He could hear it still today. Then they pushed the door down and pulled him away. He screamed. He was only a boy. He wasn't ready to die for his country. And his mother screamed. His father tried to fight back, for a few minutes, but a gun butt to the face silenced him. They had to drag him out of the house, kicking and screaming for his life. They threw him into the back of the truck. He couldn't stop crying, with the blindfold over his head. He cried and cried and cried, always hearing that knocking. Was it even there anymore? Eventually, life faded to sleep, and dream."

I just want to go home, sir. Please, I just want to go home."\n\n"Too fucking bad. Take this bag and get started down that valley. We'll be on the other side."\n\nThe two of them laughed. They both knew he wouldn't make it. They headed back into the van and drove off, leaving the boy in the dust, his tears still drying. Rummaging through the bag, he found a canteen full of water, some meager rations, stale bread, and a tarp, presumably for shelter. It would have to do. What else was he to do? Wait for the vultures to take him? So he set off, kicking rocks and yelping down the trail.\n\nWhen his anger finally melted into sadness, he began to look around him. The landscape reminded him of home. There wasn't a delta, but there were those same low mountains, those hills spotted with patches of trees. It almost felt like home.\n\nHe was tired, and hungry, and he had run out of bread. By now, the moon had come out. They were right. He would never make it. He hastily tied the tarp between two trees and sat down on a log, looking at the dark landscape. He never slept, just sitting there, crying, enraged and in a horrible stupor.\n\nUntil the sky began to move. It started out with a few blazes of light, but within a few minutes it had begun to vibrate and jostle with fantastic color. Green, purple, blue, lighting up the sky. Like some great indescribable dance.\n\n"Oh, my god. They don't have this in the south.""

 SBA_Despotist.15.desc: "The new Novosibirsk technical school had been nothing but trouble. The schooling was leaving kids with no idea how to do anything technical, and it seemed that the teachers were all subversives educating their pupils on nothing but anarchist revolutionary thought. Some of the students had recently been getting drunk and running an organization called the "New Anarchists", proclaiming their hatred for the Security Council and their wish for a return to Pyotr's idealism.\n\nIt was on one freezing night in Novosibirsk when a band of the New Anarchists staged a "protest" on the street. They yelled drunken slurs at passing soldiers and threw loose bricks and rocks from the cobblestone. A crowd began to build up, of curious spectators and disgruntled soldiers. It seemed as if this was about to turn into a one-sided fight, a Boston Massacre for a new Russia. Which new Paul Revere would depict it, famously? Which Crispus Attucks would lead the charge for freedom and Anarchy?\n\nA soldier pulled out a rusty revolver and shot it in the air three times. Perhaps the bravery of these anarchists had been overstated. Upon hearing the gunshots, they scrambled to run."

 SBA_Despotist.16.desc: "It felt good to win. It felt good to be himself. It felt good to relax and unwind, simply sipping the most luxury alcohol Russia had to offer. Looking out from his balcony, Ivan Stepanov saw Russia, HIS Russia. Of course it 'belonged to the people', anarchy was alive and well. A matter of fact, anarchy had never been stronger! Stepanov nearly spat out his wine in laughter.\n\nHe was out there somewhere, in a shallow grave, buried in the place he loved. Poetic. Stepanov should try poetry maybe! If only he had the time in between managing people and the military. He might write down his ideas one day, who knows? A better question, who cares? Stepanov certainly didn't. This night was his alone. No Pyotr to pester him with ideology, no Valenteev to threaten his rule, and no guilt to haunt him.\n\nGeneral Ivan Stepanov carefully selected a record off his shelf and put it under the needle. The sun began to set over Siberia, casting a golden light on the treacherous general. Was it worth it? To put up with all the nonsense of Comrade this and that? To slaughter men in the name of an ideology he couldn't care less for? Most definitely.\n\nStepanov sat in his reclining chair, there would be issues: the impending liberation, the growing Black Army, weeding out the last holdouts of Pyotr's supporters. Those were issues for tomorrow. Tonight belonged to him, Russia belonged to him, the most brilliant thief, the one who stole the anarchist movement out from underneath them."

They were drinking and stripping; it was a normal night. That was, until she said those words.\n\n"Oh yeah, totally nuked the trees."\n\nOne of the prettier whores, with bright red lipstick and a short skirt that Stepanov had personally requested.\n\n"Wait. Aleksadrina, was it? No. Karine. What did you just say?"\n\n"I- I just said I had to cut down these trees outside of my place. One of them was going to fall. I didn't mean any offense, Mr. Stepanov. And - it's Anastasia, sir."\n\n"No. Karine, you used a very specific word to describe you cutting down those trees."\n\n"Nuked?"\n\n"Yes. Yes, that's it! That's it!"\n\nThe Siberian hookers looked in awe as Stepanov jaunted out of the dacha, hopped into his car, and drove south. Well, he had paid them for the night and there was alcohol, why not party a little longer?\n\nStepanov was a little drunk, but it was clear. He needed a nuclear bomb. It was the only way. At this stage, who wouldn't invade them? Without that great deterrent which kept the rest of the world in a stasis, it would already be engulfed in war."

Forcing himself to breath and slow down, he realized what must be done.\n\nThe Black Army had become rulers, and if there was anything Pyotr hated more than the state, it was the rulers that upheld the state that deserved to be punished. When a people's army loses its ideals and the support of it's people it simply becomes a group of bandits, and Siuda was sad to admit that that is what it had become. Who knew what they were plotting? To overthrow the anarchy, the freedom that they had fought so hard for? Restore some state rooted in the ideas of communism but so devoid of the actual ideals it represents? It must end. They must be killed. And if they couldn't be killed, worked nearly to death.\n\nThe reprisals started out small. Communes recalling soldiers or generals under "suggestion" from Pyotr. A few in the lower ranks disappeared into the north. By the end of the month, the writing was on the wall. So many men simply gone. Officially, many had simply never existed, wiped off the record. But it was an open secret where they were. Either lost to an eternal dreamless sleep, or toiling in camps up north. Life was brutal and often short in those camps. Men arrived in tears, begging for some other punishment, something else. But Siuda had enough with tyrants. He'd had enough with the people being little more than slaves of bandits. The Black Army must be cleansed."

They were pulling the strings on it all. The fucking Jews.\n\nArtur tried to determine what the smell in the mine was. Sickly, almost. But when he inhaled the air, his throat filled with thick, choking dust. He could hardly breath. God, why hadn't he fought the Jews to the death? He had killed one, he thought, but now that he thought back to it, that might have been one of his own men. The rifles. They were made my Jews, they had faulty triggers. And now what, they were making a nuclear bomb? No shit, considering atoms were a Jewish science. He had to get back to Germania. He had to warn Hitler. Was Hitler even alive anymore? Oh my god, he couldn't breathe. He had to get back to Hitler. Get out of the mine, tell him they were building a bomb. The Jews. Yes, that was it. They were building a bomb. Artur clawed his way back to the sunlight. It was that direction, wasn't it? He thought he had taken a left there... maybe it was right? Yes, there it is. The sunlight. They made these mines so dusty and dark and confusing. Maybe it was the dust. He just couldn't get the dust out.\n\nThe guard watched as a man stumbled out of the mine, wheezing and mumbling. He just kept coughing out dust.\n\n"Get back in there, fascist scum! Your workday isn't over yet!"\n\nThe man stared back and started murmuring. "You're a Jew." He crawled up to the guard. "Why the fuck are you sons of Zion building the bomb? Why? Answer me!" The man stopped to wheeze.\n\n"Touch me and I'll shoot, Nazi."\n\nArtur limply punched the guard, and in one shot to the chest his life was gone."

For Stepanov, it was one of his peaks. Parading the bomb through Novosibirsk - even if it was just a dummy - proved to be a truly prideful moment for Stepanov. After the large papier mache bomb was driven through Novosibirsk, he stood up on a podium in Anarchy Square and began speaking to a cold and thoroughly bored crowd.\n\n"I wanted to thank all of the nuclear scientists that aided in the development of this technological marvel and have come here to witness it's display."\n\nNone of the scientists had shown up, but a light smattering of applause did begin. Stepanov continued. "This bomb will not only ensure our freedom, but will let our advanced capabilities be known to the entire world!"\n\nDick closed the newspaper. What a strange speech from Russia.

Unfortunately the original fool happened to be a sweet-talker, and so we are left with a world full of them. One particular type of fool which I despise the most is those that have faith in human nature. There is one thing to have faith in, and that is God. Not some myth of a pure man, or socialism, but the unity of god. And it seems that it is that faith that has led us to traitors, false shepherds like our old friend Siuda.\n\nMen of Novosibirsk, do not follow in the footsteps of these men. Human nature is a terrible, terrible thing. Anarchy is nasty, brutish, and short. Only the leadership of a strongman may stop man from descending into war of all against all. I implore you, men of little faith, to rest that faith in me. For The Black Army will never stop to descend you from the tides of wild, ravaging savages.

Those damn posters, proclaiming the imminent defeat of the Germans and the triumphant Red Army marching forward. They used to be everywhere, plastered on every wall, smashed between every door. Now, they fluttered in the streets, stuck on trees or burned for warmth. Those unlucky enough to be stuck outside for the night stacked them on as blankets against the Siberian night. Fyodor reminisced to the days when a few unlucky posters ended up as toilet paper. They supposed that it was better than leaves.\n\nIt was strange, then, to see a new poster in Novosibirsk. This was not in the crisp red that Bukharin's poster had. With a closer look, Fyodor could see the imperfections in the printing. Color bled over lines, figures in the background were hardly more than black smudges. It was crude, but nevertheless a propaganda poster. What it depicted was strange. In the center was a man on his knees, bowing his head forward. The tattered cavalryman's uniform and wide handlebar mustache revealed the man's identity; Semyon Budyonny, that Bolshevik killed during the charge on Bratsk. With a sword to his throat was another man whose face wasn't revealed, but he had the build of a typical Black Army soldier. Squinting at the details, Fyodor could not make out the man's identity.\n\nFyodor has been there, at the charge. The high water of the Black Army's fight against the Bolsheviks to the east. Firing his old bolt-action at those horses. Budyonny headed the charge, and he was thrown off his horse when a stray bullet hit the brute's torso. As the Black Army beat off the Reds. At the end of it all, Siuda shot Budyonny in the head. The news carried throughout the region. The devil of Bratsk was dead. Why then, Pyodor thought, was some anonymous soldier executing Budyonny, and not Pyotr? It took a moment, but it dawned on Pyodor. Stepanov, that old bastard, wasn't trying to trumpet Pyotr's achievements. He was trying to trumpet the Black Army's. No better than Bukharin."

The leech he was, the way money disappeared from the budget in his presence would impress Stepanov if it weren't so tedious.\n\n"Comrade Stepanov, this is Androniy Mishurenko."

Sure, things weren't perfect, but if things got bad you could go to some soldiers and get the bigots to at least apologize. When he was getting beaten, he was pretty sure he recognized one of the soldiers he had notified amongst the thugs. Maybe it was the head trauma, but Andrey couldn't remember when things changed. The shift in attitude happened after the Security Council took charge, but they had been some of the proponents of the protections, right?\n\nAndrey sighed.
