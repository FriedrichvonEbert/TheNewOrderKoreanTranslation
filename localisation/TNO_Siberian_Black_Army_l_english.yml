 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SIBERIAN_SOVIET_DESC: "연방의 붕괴로 앙가라 강 유역의 시민들은 러시아 정부의 권위로부터 자유로워졌습니다. 진정한 사회주의적 방식으로 그들이 한 첫번째 일은 위원회를 구성하는 것이었습니다. 많은 지역 공동체들이 정부의 감독 없이 잘 작동되고 있었고, 배급제도를 축소시키면 연방 안의 다른곳에서 수입한 많은 물품들은 현지 대체품으로 대체될 수 있었습니다. 서러시아의 소련 정부 잔당들과의 접촉은 끊겼으며, 그들은 자신들의 피로 자유를 위해 투쟁하는 민병대를 형성하면서 중앙 시베리아 공화국의 '민주적'인 임시정부와 겐리흐 야고다의 압제적인 정권을 인정하기를 주저했습니다. 그래서 그들은 한때 소련의 가장 먼 곳에서부터 아나키즘 사상가들의 유입에 영향을 받아, 그들은 모든 도시와 산업 조합의 대표자가 동등한 자치 통치 기구인 시베리아 아나키즘 평의회로서의 독립을 선언했습니다.\n\n외세의 위협으로부터의 입지가 안정됨에 따라, 이야 강의 자유 공산주의 군벌인 시베리아 흑군은 평의회의 영향력이 강한 단체가 되어 군사적 아나키즘을 주요 강령으로 선언했습니다. 민병대는 자유 지대의 모든 남녀의 필수적인것이 되었으며 자유 공동체의 무장조직은 자유 공동체를 위한 자기 방어 수단일 뿐만 아니라 자유로운 이념을 해외에도 전파하는 목적으로 모였습니다.\n\n아나키즘의 이상과 모순인 것처럼 보이는 군사적 아나키즘 사회는 군대와 평의회 사이의 많은 분쟁을 없앴습니다, 그렇지만 많은 평민들은 시베리아 공동체의 독립 수호자들인 흑군의 야망이 결국 평민들의 자유의 후퇴가 될까봐 두려워합니다."
 
 POLITICS_KHAKASSIA_SECURITY_COUNCIL_DESC: "어머니 아나키의 시작과 지속에 의한 충격만큼이나 방위 위원회가 시베리아 정치의 결정적인 힘으로 부상한 것은 많으면서도 적은 이들에게 충격으로 다가왔습니다. 국제 관측통들은 소외된 총회의 의미를 곰곰이 생각하고 있는 반면, 권력을 가진 흑군의 지휘 아래 있는 사람들은 그들 앞에 더 어려운 난제를 겪고 있는데, 바로 그들이 여전히 자유롭다고 부를 수 있는가에 대한 문제입니다.\n\n중앙 시베리아에서 제공하는 가장 영향력 있고 재능 있는 장교들로 구성된 자유 지구는 당초 목표에서 벗어나 항로를 변경했습니다. 한때는 평생 폭정의 군홧발 밑에서 살아온 고통을 본 사람들이 모여 영겁의 시간동안 인류를 괴롭혔던 억압적인 체제에 대항하는 단결된 투쟁이었던 것이 이반 스테파노프 장군의 계략에 의해 변화되고 기형적으로 변질된 것입니다.\n\n스테파노프의 명성은 중앙 시베리아 공화국이 붕괴하는 동안 나타났습니다. 야고다 국가의 심장부로 진격해 들어가는 임무를 맡은 사단장이었던 장군은 의회에서 정치꾼들이 내리는 명령에 의해 더 많은 러시아인들이 더 많은 러시아인들을 죽이기 위해 행진하는 무의미함을 보았습니다. 힘 있는 웅변가이자 노조 지도자 표트르 시우다와의 즉흥적인 협상에서 스테파노프는 폭정과 권위에 대항하여 그의 사단을 규합했고 시우다는 그 운동의 대중적 지지를 확보했습니다.\n\n이반 스테파노프의 정상에 오르기위한 여정은 오랜 시간이 걸렸지만, 총회가 무력화되면서, 이제 장군이 해야할 일은 명확해졌습니다. 그가 항상 해왔던 일을 하는 것, 좋은 공연을 해내는 것입니다."
 
 POLITICS_MONGUSH_BUYAN_BADYRGY_DESC: "The former Chairman of the Council of Ministers and presumed successor to Donduk Kuular in the old Tuvan People's Republic, Mongush Buyan-Badyrgy leads a people that have long been neglected and forgotten. Enduring through the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva emerged as an independent state, sending what little aid they could to the Mongolian People's Republic to hold off the imperialist Japanese forces. Yet in spite of the efforts of the Tuvan and Mongolian people, Ulaanbaatar fell to the invaders, and many in Kuular's government feared Kyzyl would be next.\n\nSo, when Red Army forces arrived in Tuva, this was received as nothing short of a blessing. The request that the Tuvan People's Republic would become subordinate to the Red Army command was an insignificant price to pay in return for a chance to stave off Japan.\n\nAfter Kuular's death, Buyan-Badyrgy became the new head of the Tuvan government under the People's Revolutionary Council. And when Red Army forces capitulated to the Black Army invading from the north, he was allowed to walk free due to his popularity with the Tuvan people. For a time Buyan-Badyrgy remained content with this; little had changed other than the banner of the army protecting them. Yet once again chaos erupted in the war-torn region as various communes in the north of the Free Territory declared their secession, and had led to the arrival of Ivan Stepanov's forces.\n\nNow a new army had arrived in Tuva, for much the same reasons as the last. This army, however, they had no desire for cooperation with the Tuvan people; they organized conscription, diverted production and set up defences, dragging Tuva into more needless conflict. Buyan-Badyrgy could not stand idly by through this, and so, rallying former members of the Tuvan army and government, alongside Altaic partisans, he led a revolt against the Black Army's rule. Once more Tuva must fight against overwhelming forces, yet having overcome such odds before, Buyan-Badyrgy knows Tuva will prevail again."
 POLITICS_REGIONAL_COUNCILS_DESC: "Anarchy - the ideal that had liberated Central Siberia from the shackles of authoritarianism, warlordism and elitism, has fallen. When the communes of Krasnoyarsk declared their independence and returned to the darkness that had consumed the region months prior, the communes of northern Siberia found themselves cut off from the General Assembly's guidance. Panic rose as the loss of an agreed-upon inter-communal body left them divided and undirected.\n\nYet days passed, which became weeks and then months, and the communes of north Siberia remained. The fear of invasion from the new warlords to the south did not come to fruition, the prospect of a famine arising from a lack of coordination between communes, too, never came to pass. Although undoubtedly facing hardships, the decentralised communes of the North Siberian Soviets have survived, now separate from all authority.\n\nWhile this extreme decentralisation makes the fielding of an army, coordination in development and any form of decisive action near impossible, the communes of Norilsk, Kolpashevo and their many rural comrades persist. The General Assembly, previously seen as vital to the coordination of the Free Territory, is now seen as an obsolete organization, one which impeded the people of Siberia from realising true anarchism.\n\nThough in the harsh lands of Russia, with warlords to the south and centralized states forming to the east and west, can such a system truly survive?"
 POLITICS_IVAN_STEPANOV_DESC: "If there were to be one upside to the collapse of the Soviet Union, it would undoubtedly be the wide assortment of characters, heroes and villains alike, with wildly different motivations, dreams, and goals able to reforge the nation in their own vision. What warlord could claim to be as visionary as the Free Territory? The struggle for anarchism didn't always have to be a dream. There exists a world where Siuda and his faction are triumphant, a world where anarchism is finally allowed a chance to prove itself, a world where all people may one day be free, a world without Ivan Georgievich Stepanov.\n\nWhat sets Stepanov apart from Leninist mutineers and Rurikids monarchs is not that he is without vision or purpose, in that regard he isn't much different from Siuda himself. One could easily claim that Stepanov's vision is grander than Siuda's or any other warlord scattered across shattered Russia. Slowly building a hidden hierarchy in the Free Territory that revolves entirely around him, Stepanov pioneered the Security Council, a body able to override the General Assembly in the name of territorial integrity. At the time, the Security Council was an absolute necessity, forcing even the most passionate ideologues to begrudgingly accept the body's role in the Free Territory. However, as the Free Territory subsumed more and more, people began to question why the council was still necessary.\n\nWell? Why was it? To the safety of the Free Territory, it was no longer necessary. To finalize Stepanov's goals, the Security Council was everything, the only way for him to exercise control. And, for Ivan Stepanov, that's what it's always been about; control. For the longest time, Stepanov has been willing to bide his time, to wait until he was the focal point in which the Free Territory revolves around. But he's waited for more than two decades now, putting up with the nonsensical whims of people whose ideology he doesn't understand and doesn't care to. Many opportunities have presented themselves to Stepanov and he's let them slip right through his fingers. Now, in the chaos of anarchy, Stepanov will grab that opportunity tight, strangle it, and never let go."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_ASTAFYEV: "Krasnoyarsk was a state founded on promises. Promises of freedom, promises of greatness, promises of prosperity for decades to come. Where are all those promises now?\n\nComrade Siuda made many promises upon the Black Army's entry into Krasnoyarsk as well. Promises of liberation, promises of emancipation, and promises of equality for all. For a time, in the days and weeks following the collapse of Andreev's fiefdom, these promises were made good upon. The Black Army expelled the city's oppressors while representatives of the General Assembly established a local assembly in conjunction with the Social Democratic Party. It was in the overcrowded, unkept, and musty cafeteria of the Siberian Technical Institute of Forest that Viktor Petrovich Astafyev first got a taste for anarchism. Those sent to aid in the reorganization of structure in the city did well at adjusting a moderate democrat such as Astafyev to the new lifestyle awaiting him and the other inhabitants of the city. Emerging as a communal leader, Astafyev met with Siuda and Taratuta on multiple occasions. Viktor's close association with Siuda and high-ranking members of the General Assembly made his betrayal all the worse.\n\nAstafyev pondered if this was truly anarchism as his city became home to the headquarters of the Black Army. Astafyev's requests for increased civilian governance fell on deaf ears as quotas were delivered from Kilchichakov, Mishurenko established a permanent residence in the city alongside his large following of soldiers, and Stepanov cast down veto after veto on local motions.\n\nSiuda truly is no different than Andreev, and Astafyev and the people of Russia are far past empty promises. Though Siuda and the General Assembly have made multiple requests for Krasynoarsk to return to the fold, Siuda is not free of sin. In the mind of Viktor Nekrasov, associating with tyrants makes one no better, and tyrants have no place in a free Russia."
 POLITICS_YURIY_KRYLOV_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Yuriy Nikolayevich Krylov is a man trapped in a storybook. At least, it's been easier for him to view his life as a story being told rather than a life being lived. The author of the tragedy has seen fit that Yuriy be a protagonist, a prince presiding over a troubled land.\n\nOnce upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young boy. He was a noble, but lived as one amongst the citizens of the flourishing kingdom. One day, while the young boy read by the river, an evil wizard came to his kingdom, hexing all those around him to be slaves, unrelenting in service to their master. The wizard's tricks did not affect the royal family. The king and his guard fought gallantly to repel the wizard, but the wizard and his knight overwhelmed the kingdom, taking the king prisoner and leaving the hero's sister slain in battle.\n\nSpared by the forces of the wizard under the protection of his subjects, Yuriy assumed a new identity, renouncing his titles. Still, the hero worked tirelessly to enhance the lives of his people, subverting the wizard's puppet administration. For a time, it seemed as though the wizard's empire was invincible, until a rift opened up between the wizard and the knight. The knight began to assert himself as the hegemon of the region, using whatever means necessary to secure a kingdom of his own. The brutal methods of the knight and the waning influence of the wizard provided an opportunity to strike, as the prophecy had foretold.\n\nThe hero, having assumed the name and title of King Rurik III, rallied his most loyal supporters to break free of the wizard's brainwashing and to live in freedom once more. While the hero of prophecy recuperates his forces, the mad general of the south continues his raids. The story of King Rurik III is far from over. The battle of prophecy will soon commence and the people can finally live...\n\n§G...Happily ever after.§!"
 POLITICS_VASILY_SHUKSHIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "What place does a conservative businessman have in Russia? In the days of the empire, he would find his virgining enterprise quashed by the backwardness of the Tsar. In the days of the Union, he would find his owings confiscated at best and his life too at worst. Now, in the days of the Russian anarchy, more than ever, what place is there for a conservative businessman?\n\nDespite his grievances with Pokryshkin and the unapologetic kleptocrats of the federation, the fall of Novosibirsk and, more importantly to him, Barnaul, left Shukshin in a severe state of depression. The chaos and confusion of the days and weeks following the capitulation of the federation scattered many of Russia's best and brightest into the wind. Pokryshkin; missing and presumed dead. The chief officers of the mega corporations; executed or imprisoned. Vasily Makarovich Shukshin was all that remained of the capitalist establishment. Forced into a life of reclusion after his popularity with the citizenry spared him from punishment, Shukshin spent his days drinking in the solitude of his home. Truly, people reach their lowest points when excluded from the majority and under the tyranny of the General Assembly, the majority was never so powerful and Shukshin was never so weak..That was, until one day, Shukshin received a letter.\n\nA former high ranking member of the Barnaul city council expressed the raising discontent in the city. The letter was clear in goal, even if the language hid the fact, the cracks in the anarchist foundation had begun to show and the people yearned for the promise of the federation. Shukshin became a man rejuvenated, his optimism and sense of purpose restored. The schism in the anarchist movement proves only one thing, anarchism doesn't work. Unlike the splintered anarchist movement, Shukshin has a job to do, and he'll be damned if the anarchists get the better of him twice."
 POLITICS_VITALY_KOSTIN_COLLAPSE_DESC: "Can one person change the world? Sure. A Romanov, a businessman, a scholar, people of class, all can bend the world to their whims. But can a slave? Can a simple worker take the reins of oppression and break them without a Lenin? Vitaly Semyonovich Kostin doesn't really know, and, in all honesty, he hoped he would never have to find out.\n\nNothing more than a construction engineer in Novosibirsk, Kostin quickly became one of the most ardent supporters of the Free Territory and their liberationist message. Present at the liberation of the city, Kostin proved an effective organizer and orator, with his simple populist message resonating with his fellow workers. The strike fostered by Kostin proved instrumental in the Free Territory's campaign against the Siberian Falcon. Following the establishment of an assembly in Novosibirsk, Kostin, a man of humble origins, sought to return to his modest life of work, content to leave the fate of Russia to the capable hands of Comrade Siuda. But it was not Siuda who laid claim to the city first.\n\nIn the weeks following the campaign, one name became more common than that of Pokryshkin; Ivan Stepanov. They began as whispers, rumors of a powerful lackey to Siuda who formed the muscle of their duo. Word spread quickly, but it was the seemingly unendingly increasing number of Black Army soldiers present at factories and demonstrations that made it clear something was amiss. Strict quotas, political repression, and rampant corruption left many residents of the city scratching their heads, wondering what changed. The blatant repression of the working people became so severe it forced one man out of retirement.\n\nBetrayed by the capitalists of Novosibirsk and once more by the anarchists of Kansk, Kostin embodies the heart and soul of the Russian people; tired. How many revolts must occur? How many times must the people be lied to? Kostin doesn't know all the answers, he doesn't know much at all, but he does know that oppression in any form must be stamped out, no matter if it hides behind the skull and crossbones or not."
 POLITICS_VIKTOR_NEKRASOV_DESC: "Disillusioned with the tyranny of Chairman Yagoda and at odds with the corporate capitalists of Novosibirsk, Viktor Platonovich Nekrasov found himself most closely aligned with Shostakovich and the Humanist salon in Tomsk. Despite this, Nekrasov could never find his footing with the more radical social democrats and moderate socialists. Nekrasov felt lost. His ideology was much to the left of prominent humanists yet still to the right of the anarchist movement cultivating to the south. Without a movement to call home, Nekrasov resigned himself to a life of writing, a passion he had picked up after settling in the intellectual heart of Russia. Nekrasov took an interest in journalism. His lack of ideological alignment may have left him isolated but granted him an exceptional career as a war correspondent, covering the movements of warlords across Central Siberia and to the east. It was the Black Army that garnered the most attention from him.\n\nIf his attention was not captured by the expansion of the Free Territory, its leaders marching down the streets of Tomsk most certainly did. While his views didn't line up with Siudaist thought one to one, he had little complaints in the following the liberation of the city. The abolishment of the salon system offered him more say than previously, and the Territory's aversion to authoritarianism was certainly appreciated. As days and weeks went by, however, it seemed as though the conflict in Tomsk never ceased. Anarchist splinter groups loyal to different factions and philosophies battled openly in the streets prompting larger quantities of Black Army detachments to police the city.\n\nAs the conflict swelled, Nekrasov felt a divide grow in him as well. If history were to continue, if scholars and scribes could still find work in a cutthroat era of utilitarianism, the march on Tomsk would go down as the most significant workers strike of a generation and Viktor Nekrasov wouldn't be where he was. However, fate is often unkind, and those with the best intentions often find themselves on the wrong side of history."

 SBA_intro_assemble_the_communal_representatives_desc: "시베리아 흑군 총회는 우리가 해방시킨 아나키즘 공동체와 모든 공동체의 정책 조율을 목표로, 우리의 탄생 첫해에 만들어진 기관 중 하나였습니다. 정기적으로 소집되어 일상적인 문제를 다루는 경우가 많지만, 자유구역의 완벽한 작동엔 여전히 중요합니다.\n\n시간이 흐를수록, 우리는 이 혼란스럽고 불안정한 환경에서 계속 생존하고 있으며, 우리가 방심하지 않고 아나키의 이상을 유지한다는 사실과 많은 관련이 있습니다. 이를 위해 우리는 또한 내부에서의 협력을 추구해야하며, 총회는 우리 영토의 문제를 공개적이고 투명하게 논의함으로써 우리에게 그 일을 할 수 있는 탁월한 방법을 제공합니다."
 SBA_intro_assemble_the_security_council_desc: "시베리아 흑군은 러시아 인민의 진정한 자유를 옹호하지만, 현재 우리가 처해있는 상황에서 군대의 조직적 보호가 필요없다고 주장하는 것은 터무니 없는 거짓말일 것입니다. 그래서 우리는 인민들이 지지하는 군사적 아나키즘 체제를 채택했습니다. 이 체제에 중요한 것은 흑군에 충성하는 모든 민병대의 지휘관들로 구성된 안전 보장 위원회입니다. 물론, 이 지휘관들은 모두 군인들이 스스로 뽑은 것이고, 이렇게 함으로써 우리는 그들이 우리의 목소리와 이익을 대변한다고 확신할 수 있습니다. 안전 보장 위원회의 또 다른 회의는 우리가 최근의 모든 안보문제를 언급하고 해결하는데 도움을 줄 것입니다."

 SBA_intro_present_revolutionary_security_reports_desc: "자유구역의 군대는 해방된 우리 땅을 지키는 중추적인 역할을 하고 있는데, 그들이 아니였다면 우리는 결코 사슬을 끊어내지 못했을 것이고, 우리는 여전히 야고다의 압제적인 제국 또는 중앙 시베리아 '민주' 국가의 통치하에 있을 것입니다. 그러나 모든 부대의 기능과 동작들의 보증하는 것을 동기화되고 조화를 이루도록 하는 것은 엄청나게 어려운 작업입니다. 그러한 이유로, 우리 영토 전역의 상황들을 개략적으로 설명하고, 공동체를 위험으로부터 구제하고 방어하기 위한 노력을 조정하는데 도움을 주는 "보안 보고서"가 있습니다. 제 3차 칸스크 총회가 열리는 상황에서 보안 보고서는 중앙 시베리아의 큰 그림과 그것이 아나키스트 공동체에 미치는 영향을 보여주기 때문에 중요합니다. 러시아 군벌주의의 혼란 속에서 우리가 직면한 위협에 대처하는 단결력은 매우 중요합니다."
 SBA_intro_present_local_developmental_reports_desc: "칸스크 총회에서 수많은 공동대표들에게 우리 실험의 성공을 보여주려면, 프로젝트의 성과와 모든 정착지의 자치권들을 보여줘야 합니다. 모든 마을이 국가 당국으로부터가 아나라 단지 아나키 상태의 원리를 통해 도움을 받아 지역 주민들이 자유롭게 그들의 터전을 개발할 수 있도록 했다는 것은 분명합니다. 우리는 전문가들로 하여금 총회의 개발 도상 지역사회에 대한 그들의 연구 결과와 보고서를 발표하게 함으로써 이것을 강조할 필요가 있습니다. 이런 식으로, 우리는 또한 고집스러운 대표들에게 우리 체제의 효과에 대해 설득시킬 것입니다."

 SBA_second_the_red_mantle_desc: "시베리아 계획은 독소전에 산업적으로 대비하기 위해 전선에서 떨어진 곳에서 시작한 대규모 산업 계획이었습니다. 결국 전쟁에서는 패했지만, 그 기간 동안 건설한 산업은 그 어느 누구도 예상했던거보다 훨씬 능가하도록 소련을 밀었습니다. 아이러니하게도, 시베리아 소비에트의 영토는 이 계획의 핵심 지역이 아니었고, 따라서 우리의 산업 능력은 이웃 나라들에 비해 낮습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 우리가 지금 이용할 수 있는 산업은 우리가 확장할 수 있는 견고한 기반을 제공할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_peoples_survey_desc: "코뮌 경제에서 자원을 적절하게 할당하기 위해서는, 어떤 지역이 산업 개발에 적합한지 혹은 자원 추출에 적합한지 그것도 아니면 농업 개발에 적합한지 아는 것이 중요합니다. 게다가 군벌들 사이의 경계는 종종 불확실하고 바뀌기 마련입니다. 토지 조사를 통해 우리는 정확히 어떤 영토가 우리 땅인지, 그리고 전쟁이 발발했을 때 어떤 영토를 방어하는 것이 가치 있거나 전략적인지를 알 수 있을 것이다. 이를 위해 코뮌들은 이웃 코뮌들과 협력하여 자발적으로 토지를 측량하는 '인민 설문 조사'에 참여하도록 요청받을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_industrial_data_consolidation_desc: "우리의 독특한 분산형 정부 형태로 인해, 각 코뮌이 이용 할 수 있는 산업적 기계의 품질과 양은 종종 코뮌 스스로가 무엇을 생산할 수 있는지에 따라 결정됩니다. 이로 인해 지역사회 간 산업력 격차가 크게 벌어졌고, 일부 지역사회는 그들의 필요에 맞춰서 생산을 할 수 없게 되었습니다. 여러 공동체에서 제공하는 산업 정보를 조합한 결과, 생산 능력에 대한 투자를 통해 자신의 효용을 얻을 수 있는 여러 공동체들을 확인하게 되었습니다."
 SBA_second_begin_the_redistribution_desc: "우리가 시베리아 소비에트 연방을 처음 설립했을 때 시작한 토지 개혁은 아직도 끝나지 않았습니다. 단순히 시베리아 전쟁에서 살아남는 것에 초점을 맞춰서 우리의 시간과 노력의 대부분을 소비했기 때문이죠. 이러한 문제들이 해결되었기 때문에, 우리는 각 공동체의 요구에 따라 토지를 재분배하는 것을 재개 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 우리가 이 문제를 해결 하는데 실패한 것 주된 이유는, 일부 코뮌이 그들의 규모와 인력을 남용하여 다른 코뮌들의 필요로 하는 땅에서 몰아내도록 만들었기 때문입니다. 이 토지 개혁 계획은 보다 공정하고 공평한 방법으로 코뮌간 경계을 재정비하는 방안을 모색할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_repair_the_transsib_desc: "구 차르정의 몇 안 되는 성공 가운데는 시베리아 횡단 철도 건설이 있었습니다. 그 철도는 러시아에 큰 영향을 끼쳐, 그 나라를 이전에는 보지 못했던 방식으로 묶었죠. 부하린 정권 동안 광범위하게 사용되었고, 2차 세계대전 이후 1950년대 소련-독일 전쟁에서 소련의 중요한 동맥이 되었다. 우리가 전쟁에서 패한 후, 독일 폭격기들은 철도를 거의 완전히 파괴했습니다. 하지만, 독일 폭격기들은 러시아 상공에서 멀리 떨어져 있기 때문에, 우리는 국경 내에서 운행되는 철도의 일부를 수리할 수 있고, 이전의 영광 중 일부를 다시 되돌릴 수도 있을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_continue_regional_interconnection_desc: "기반 시설의 개발은 항상 우리가 해야할 중요한 일 중 하나입니다. 그것은 나라 전체의 자원 흐름을 개선할 뿐만 아니라, 경제적으로나 정치적으로 코뮌들을 더욱 가깝게 합니다. 코뮌 간 유대는 시베리아 소비에트 연방의 범위를 넓힐 때 시험 받을 수 있고, 그렇기 때문에 우리가 그런 유대를 강화시키는 모든 일들은 매우 중요합니다. 이를 위해, 우리는 시베리아 소비에트 전역을 여행했고, 우리를 가장 고립된 공동체와도 연결할 수 있는 도로 체제을 구축하는데 투자할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_return_to_the_mines_desc: "정상적인 경제 기능이 회복되고, 추가로 공공 재건 계획 형태로 좋게 경제를 자극하면서, 경제는 빠른 속도로 성장하기 시작했습니다. 광물 자원에 대한 수요는 거의 10배 증가했지만, 많은 코뮌들이 이를 제공할 준비가 되어 있지 않는거 같습니다. 독일 폭격기들이 큰 규모의 채굴 광산들을 파괴한다는 위협이 사라지면서, 지금은 이전에 폐쇄되었던 광산을 다시 열기에 좋은 시기인 것 같다. 게다가, 우리는 새로운 광산 장비를 제조하고 광업에 쉽게 접근 가능한 코뮌에 그 장비들을 배포할 시기입니다."
 SBA_second_dedicated_agricultural_production_desc: "우리의 코뮌들은 날이 갈수록 더 커지고 있습니다. 우리의 코뮌들이 매일 한 가정들에게 제공하는 영양과 경제적 안정은 출산률에 뚜렷한 영향을 끼치고 있습니다. 이 점을 염두에 두고, 우리의 농업 생산량을 늘리는 것이 옳아보입니다. 결론부터 말하면, 기계화된 농업 장비를 농업 생산량을 높히기 위해 생산하고 코뮌에 분배되어야 합니다. 이것은 우리의 농부들이 더 많은 생산품을 생산하는데 도움을 줄 뿐만 아니라, 우리 노동자들이 다른 일을 할 수 있는 자유 시간도 줄 것이다."
 SBA_second_rural_production_nodes_desc: "아나키즘 사회의 핵심은 도시나 교외에 있는 것이 아니라 시골 마을과 그 안에 있는 지역 사회에 있습니다. 이러한 공동체들이 도시의 제조품에 대한 의존을 끝내도록 돕는 것은 우리의 중요한 목표입니다. 따라서, 우리는 코뮌 스스로 생산품을 생산할 수 있도록 지역 작업장의 개발을 장려할 것입니다. 또한 이러한 코뮌을 통해 공동체들은 칼라시니코프의 총기장 같은 것이 바로 뒷마당에 있기 때문에 더욱 쉽게 무장할 수 있을 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_foundation_laid_desc: "많은 사람들이 불가능하다고 생각하는 아나키즘 실험을, 우리는 반박하며 우리의 이데올로기가 우월하다는 것을 몇 번이고 계속 증명하고 있습니다. 우리의 도덕성을 손상시키지 않고, 우리는 생산수단을 통제하는 소수의 특권층없이, 모든 사람들에게 이익을 주는 경제체제를 만들 수 있었습니다. 우리는 모든 러시아 인민들을 위한 경제적 기반을 다진 것입니다."
 SBA_second_the_grey_area_desc: "완벽한 이 세계에서는, 부유한 부자들이 선호하는 국가와, 그들을 지배하는 부패하고 불공정한 국가에 대한 인민들의 대답으로써, 아나키즘 사회가 자연스럽게 생겨날 것입니다. 그러나 현 상태를 보면, 인민들이 당초 예상보다 그들의 국가에 더 애착을 가지고 있는 것처럼 보이고, 그러한 인민들이 사는 많은 국가들은 우리의 존재 자체를 문제 삼고 있습니다. 개개 코뮌들은 이들의 침략을 물리칠 수 없기 때문에 우리가 살아남으려면 중앙집권적인 군대가 필요합니다. 그러나 그런 기구들은 아나키즘의 근본과 모순되지 않나요? 게다가, 얼마나 민주적인지에 상관없이 모든 코뮌들을 지배하는 중앙 평의회는 아나키즘의 이상에도 반대하지 않나요? 우리의 이념적 핵심을 배반 했다고 할 수준으로 우리의 뿌리로부터 멀어지려면 어느정도 멀어져야 할까요? 중앙정부가 아닌 코뮌들과 개인에게 어디까지 그 권리가 허용되어야 하는지 정확히 짚고 넘어가야 할 것입니다."
 SBA_second_delegate_industrial_administration_desc: "공산주의의 핵심은 생산수단을 인민에게 돌려주는 것이 목표인 이념입니다. 중앙집권적인 정부에게 경제를 통제하게 하는 것은 이 목표와 완전히 모순됩니다. 따라서 우리 경제의 효율성을 향상시키기 위해서는, 우리는 대신 몇몇 공동체로부터 산업 평의회를 만들어, 가능한 산업적 개선과 투자 할만한 지역의 목록을 만들고, 그 목록을 각 코뮌의 지방 평의회에 제출하여 검토해야 합니다. 그리고 산업 평의회는 또한 소외된 코뮌들에서 산업 건설 계획을할 수 있도록 정해진 양의 자본을 배정받게 될 것입니다."

 SBA_regional_into_a_brighter_tomorrow_desc: "Despite our struggles, the Siberian Black Army has managed to beat all of our enemies and unite Central Siberia! However, our work does not stop here, as there is much to be done. Firstly and most importantly, many new villages, towns, and even cities have come under our control, and we must work to help organize all of our new lands into proper communes. Furthermore, we must begin the long process of helping the people acclimate and understand why anarchism is the proper future of Russia.\n\nLurking and mostly unspoken is the fear that the Siberian Soviet will be subsumed by the Black Army, leading to the anarchist dream falling into the trappings of a military junta. While some of these fears may have merit, we can hopefully find a solution that allows for us to maintain freedom while preventing chaos!"
 SBA_regional_consolidate_the_regional_courts_desc: "The new territories under our control have to be consolidated and reformed into proper anarchist communes. The solution, at first glance, is to simply let the people organize themselves into communes. However, while this may seem simply easy on paper, the actual process over this reformation has caused quite the ideological debate. The people of Central Siberia have never lived under an anarchist society, and likely have no idea how to organize themselves. Furthermore, it is also likely that there are too many who still wish to see our dream foiled. Therefore, we are left with a choice. Do we allow the people to self-organize, as our ideology tells us to, or do we have the Black Army provisionally lead these lands until they are ready to properly organize?"
 SBA_regional_instate_provisional_leadership_desc: "Despite our hopes otherwise, the leaders of the SIberian Soviet know the truth. Too many of the people in the newly conquered lands are opposed to anarchism as of right now, and letting the people self-organize would only invite sabotage. While it might sting, we have no choice but to let the Black Army provisionally lead the new lands until we can be certain that the people are ready to self-organize. It may seem contradictory, but we have to do this for the sake of the revolution. With luck, the people will acclimate to anarchism quickly and control can be handed over properly to the future anarchist communes, preventing the authority of the Black Army from becoming too entrenched."
 SBA_regional_faith_in_the_newly_integrated_desc: "To let the Black Army control our new lands would be nothing but an absolute betrayal of our ideology! It may seem inane, but allowing the Black Army to control our new lands sets a bad precedent. After all, if we expand farther, why shouldn't the Black Army control those new lands until the people are acclimated to anarchism? In any case, showing that we don't trust the people undermines anarchism here in Siberia as a whole. After all, one of the major tenets of anarchism is mutual cooperation, and failing to extend a hand in trust does nothing but sabotage our hopes from the very beginning! There may be those who are unwilling to self-organize, but through proper execution of anarchist ideology as compared to throwing the army around like a fascist state, we can forge an anarchist society that is truly free!"
 SBA_regional_strike_the_balance_of_power_desc: "The Black Army is undeniably a powerful authority, and we've had to rely greatly upon them throughout all of our struggles and expansion. Such a reliance is worrying to many, and the fears of the Black Army eventually forming a military junta in all but name are widespread. Of course, we cannot allow such a tragedy to occur, especially after coming so far. To prevent the Black army from controlling too much power, we must take efforts to reinforce the soviets and communes. Strengthening the civilian councils, combined with transferring Black Army tasks to other, more representative organs will allow us to maintain our anarchist ideals even in the fact of threats!"
 SBA_regional_extend_the_communication_systems_desc: "One of the biggest issues that we have encountered in our expansion is a lack of communication ability. It can take days, even weeks to find out about various events that occur in the more rural areas. Furthermore, the need for better communication and coordination with our rural comrades is critical in this time of reorganization, as access to superior resources and ending any lurking threats are matters of the utmost importance. This communication expansion will be done by extending telegraph lines, building new radio towers, and constructing a modern phone system, allowing us to reach even the most isolated of communities. No longer will we be left in the dark when it comes to rural matters!"
 SBA_regional_correct_the_misguided_teachings_desc: "Education is undoubtedly the foundation of our future. After all, it is education that instills values in the youth, and it is education that people refer back to throughout their life. While there are aspects of the old Soviet and CSR teaching that were taught correctly and properly, there are many other aspects that must be retaught to the populace in order for them to become model anarchists. Most importantly, we must highlight the failures of the states to bring long-term stability and peace to central Siberia, and similarly showcase how anarchist thought will succeed where the puppet democracy and statist thought has failed. It may take time, but the people will finally understand the truth of anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_cast_down_social_injustice_desc: "Throughout the centuries, the Russian states in whatever form they may have taken have created a culture of inequality. Women are, more often than not, seen as inferior to men, and consigned to be housewives. People of other races have faced similar criticism, being viewed with suspicion for no other reason than prejudice. However, the group who has had it the worst of all are homosexuals. They barely have even a right to exist, with many having persecuted those unlucky enough to be revealed. Such prejudices have no place in an anarchist society. We must work to break the chains that shackle our women, show people that race is merely appearance and nothing more, and allow our homosexual comrades to finally be able to freely love whomever they want!"
 SBA_regional_enshrine_the_material_rights_desc: "Every human, no matter what, deserves the right to live. Of course, one cannot merely just live. People require material resources such as food and water. In order to ensure that we truly uphold the right of everyone to live, we must also ensure that everyone, no matter who they are, has access to the necessities of life. In order to ensure this, we must help ensure that the communes are always able to provide whatever is necessary for people to live. Obviously, we will inform the communes of their duty, but we will also remind them that they have access to aid from the greater communes if need be. We will ensure that life is able to prosper under anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_establish_the_provisional_resource_council_desc: "With our access to new lands and resources, many comrades have pointed out a need to properly coordinate said resources so that the communes can properly function. To this end, we shall establish the Provisional Resource Council. This Council's main function will be ensuring the extraction and distribution of all resources within the Free Territory. To this end, the Council will be composed of workers from resource-gathering industries and representatives from areas who need resources. This Council will hopefully be able to solve any and all needs from the cities and villages involving resource needs, while allowing the workers who produce said resources a place to be heard."
 SBA_regional_the_last_congress_of_kansk_desc: "With the rapid growth of new lands for the Free Territory, it has become clear that a more central location is needed in order for the communes to properly coordinate. However, there are a few issues that still need to be worked out, and we must make sure that the movement of the communal congress to a more central city like Novosibirsk is done officially, through democratic vote. Therefore, we shall hold one final Congress in Kansk, to solve any remaining internal issues, before moving to Novosibirsk!"
 SBA_regional_rectify_the_rural_urban_split_desc: "The first major issue that the Congress of Kansk has chosen to focus on is the urban-rural split. While most of our rural comrades have been able to begin reorganizing the villages into proper anarchist communes, our urban comrades have had difficulties. The large population of the cities combined with the high concentration of people has led to efforts requiring more intensive care and resources in order to succeed. With the consolidation of some of the other new communes, we can afford to devote more time and effort into properly reorganizing the cities. These communal governments, more than anything, will set the model for any future communes. We must try our hardest to truly liberate all of the people who live in the Free Territory and show them the light of anarchism!"
 SBA_regional_honors_for_humanity_desc: "When the Soviet Union fell and the Central SIberian Republic splintered, the people were left adrift, with lawlessness plaguing the land. To deal with the chaos, many people turned to religion, leading to the church becoming a very powerful influence in Central Siberia. While we have no interest in outright banning the church, we must take steps to curb its influence on our populace. We must take efforts to educate the populace about secularism and inspire their hopes in the communes, lessening their dependence on the church for stability. We shall also utilize the church wealth that we have been able to obtain for our own purposes instead of returning it to the church. Such efforts may seem controversial to some of our comrades, but it is necessary to help forge a better society!"
 SBA_regional_present_the_cure_desc: "When the Tsar was deposed, the people turned to another government in the form of the USSR. When the USSR fell, the people turned to yet another government in the CSR. Yet in the end, the CSR fell, like the two governments before it. These states were unable to deal with the problems that plagued Russia, and so they collapsed. However, where statism has failed, anarchism has succeeded! Indeed, in a short period of time, Central Siberia has soared by leaps and bounds! Indeed, it seems that Russia has fallen ill, and anarchism is the obvious cure to its woes! We owe it to be the stalwart doctors that ensure that the cure is properly administered!"
 SBA_regional_liberty_all_encompassing_and_eternal_desc: "With all major issues settled, the last Congress at Kansk has begun to wind down. All major internal issues seem to have been settled, with the creation of communes and councils proceeding smoothly. The Congress shall conclude with the formal vote to have all future meetings be based in Novosibirsk. Against all odds, the Free Territory has not only been able to expand, but prosper and spread anarchism all across Central Siberia! We fought in Ukraine, we fought in Catalonia, and finally, here in Central Siberia, we have succeeded. Freedom has been brought to the people, and a new dawn approaches for the Free Territory. A new dawn in which we are all able to enjoy the fruits of liberty!"
 SBA_regional_develop_the_free_territory_desc: "Our territory was never a major focus for the former Soviet government. While we did receive investment in the form of an expanded Trans-Siberian Railroad and some upgraded machinery for our urban centers, the Soviet Union simply didn't have the time or resources to invest into our home like it did in other regions. This wasn't always meant to be the case, however. The Siberian Plan would have included increased development of our civilian infrastructure, an expansion of the cities, and major investments into our military industrial plants. There would have been almost complete vertical integration of our military industry, from the extraction of unrefined iron in the ground all the way to the manufacture and distribution of Kalashnikovs. While this plan was unfeasible at the time, given our newfound resources, these plans can finally be realized."
 SBA_regional_integrate_the_urban_economies_desc: "Urban areas have always been somewhat difficult to integrate into the communal economy that we practice. Unable to provide food for themselves, oftentimes cities would be able to trade weapons produced in the city for food in the adjacent towns. With the development of localized production of guns in town centers now, this economic balance has been thrown off. In order to compensate for this lost revenue stream for the cities, we must encourage the cities to better utilize their resources, namely their larger skill pool and additional manpower, to produce more specialized items and civilian goods that they can use to continue bringing capital and food into the cities."
 SBA_regional_re_organize_the_industrial_centers_desc: "At its heart, communism is about the community above all else, and the idea that everyone can contribute to a common good. Such an ideal of community is easy to develop in tight knit village or town communities, but far more difficult in large cities. We must endeavor to promote a feeling of solidarity and brotherhood among citizens living in these cities. Such community begins in the workplace, among your coworkers and colleagues in the factory. In order to achieve this, we will rip out the old ideas of the boss worker relationship and institute a new system of worker self management."
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_kostinsty_desc: "The Kostinsty are a militant worker's organization that have existed in the area before we arrived. While our politics are not perfectly aligned, with their leadership seemingly leaning towards pre-war Bukharinist philosophy as opposed to our more radical anarcho communist policies, their organizational expertise and influence could prove incredibly useful to us. Their leadership has indicated that they are not opposed to working alongside us, and have offered assistance in the implementation of our redesigned Siberian Plan. We would be fools not to accept their offer."
 SBA_regional_the_bounty_of_the_siberian_plan_desc: "The Siberian Plan is almost complete. Already thousands of industrial machines, distributed across the whole of Siberia both to cities and towns alike, are being installed and tested for the first time. Electrical light is beginning to shine in places that had never so much as seen a light bulb before, just as thousands of positions in new coal plants across Siberia open up. The standard of living for millions across Siberia is about to experience a quantum leap, and in doing so we will thrust ourselves into becoming one of the foremost industrial powers of Russia. At this rate, we may one day eclipse even Germany..."
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_union_desc: "The Siberian plan has been a greater success than we could have ever thought possible. Even before its completion, industrial productivity across Siberia has grown by over 200 percent. In the past month alone, energy production in Siberia has grown by over 330 million kilowatt-hours, approximately the same amount as the Hoover dam produces every month. And all this has been by the mandate of our Security Council. Voices of fears that such a council might detract from our civil liberties, or even worsen the long term prosperity of our nation are now silent in the face of such great accomplishment."
 SBA_regional_reach_for_the_dawn_desc: "Rigid economic planning both restricts the rights of our citizens, and harms our economy long term. If we truly wish to see Russia prosper, and the glory of communism prevail, we must abandon these authoritarian ideas of controlling the economy through the state. Bukharin tried, and failed. If we wish to see true prosperity, we must allow worker's organizations and unions to decide for themselves what to produce as a natural reaction to the needs and demands of society and the economy. While some decry such a system as capitalism under another name, we reject such a title. This is a true socialist economy."
 SBA_regional_encourage_the_peasant_communes_desc: "Communism is inherently an ideology that favours the community over private individuals. What greater community is there of men and women than that of their whole land? We must encourage isolated rural communities, typically left unrepresented in government, to reach out and join the economic and political scene of the country. While production in a single rural community might be small, if all the rural towns and villages across the Free Territory work together, then they will know true prosperity."
 SBA_regional_develop_the_altai_region_desc: "Altai is a region of great industrial potential. While infrastructure is minimal in the region, its natural resources are practically untapped, and has a large enough population to sustain several mineral extraction and factory sites. Even just the first step to achieving this goal of industrialization within this region, that being laying down railway tracks, should be enough to begin boosting agricultural and mineral output over the course of the next few weeks as we begin pouring resources into the region."
 SBA_regional_facilitate_rural_mechanization_desc: "One of the important features of communal life is self sufficiency. While this is often not possible, given that more rural communities simply do not have the skilled labour or industrial facilities to produce things like modern electronics or automobiles, we can set these communities up with the means to acquire such items. By facilitating mechanization in the rural areas of the Free Territory, we can help rural communes outproduce their needs, allowing them to exchange the extra produce and livestock for items the rural population cannot obtain. Not to mention, having an agricultural surplus will be useful for expanding the population."
 SBA_regional_ensure_rural_interconnection_desc: "There are rural regions of the free territory that are simply unfit for major industrialization and expansion. These regions are either too isolated, or not populous enough, or are in an area vulnerable to foreign invasion. For these areas, the best we can do is extend infrastructure to connect their territories to our own. This can be done in a variety of ways, from building actual roads or railroads, to setting up phone lines or the simpler telegraph lines, to extending the power grid into their territory. This won't provide manufacturing jobs for these people, but it will hopefully allow them to attain somewhat of a higher standard of living."
 SBA_regional_enlightenment_for_all_desc: "While Russia has been embroiled in the constant civil wars and skirmishes that have resulted because of this warlordism, the superpowers of the world have been advancing their technological arsenal. From the space race to the development of transistor computing, they have expanded their computational, agricultural, and industrial output tenfold, while we have been forced to rely on decades old machinery. If we are to bring ourselves up to their level, we must begin investing into the local schools, universities, and labs in the Free Territory. Giving these centers of learning funding and autonomy is the surest way to raise our educational standard."
 SBA_regional_the_interventionist_approach_desc: "All around Russia there are nations with the capability to destroy our nation with the press of a button. Thousands of ICBMs, SLBMs, and IRBMs are armed and ready to rain down atomic fire upon Russia should those nations choose to do so. Even without such weapons, crushing our nation would be easy with modern guns and missiles they have at their disposal. Our technological ability has stagnated heavily since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and that has left our nation vulnerable. While we do not currently possess the technology or skilled technical workers capable of developing these weapons, creating an education system under the supervision of the military council will surely help us begin to bridge the gap in technological ability."
 SBA_regional_trust_in_the_educators_desc: "Some have argued that in order to bring our educational system up to par with our more advanced neighbors, we need to place the educational system under the power of the military council, so that we might bring all students and educators to the same level of educational quality across the board. This is foolish. Different regions will have different needs. Rural villages might want to teach their students about tractor maintenance and engine repair, whereas cities might want to educate their students in power production and computer science. We should trust local educators to decide on a curriculum that benefits their community's needs."
 SBA_regional_inspire_progressive_thought_desc: "Control of education is of the utmost importance to the security of the Free Territory. While the military council would like to leave the communes' educators to their own devices, it would invite subversion and reactionary ideas to be indoctrinated into our nation's youth. Anarchism as a whole would be threatened if the military doesn't step in and prevent its collapse. The fifth column must be stopped. To that end, we will create an all encompassing curriculum that will teach both the basics necessary for the students to function as adults as well as professing the tenets of anarchism."
 SBA_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc: "The Free Territory's borders are always at risk. Warlords, bandits, and raiders stand ready to raid and loot our cities and towns at the drop of a dime. It has become necessary to begin reforming the militia into a fully fledged army. In order to achieve this, we will need to invest into more specialized equipment, like anti-tank, anti-air, and sniper weapons, in order to increase our army's effectiveness. Additionally, we will need to begin increasing the discipline of our army. These men can no longer simply be volunteer farmers, they must be soldiers, and we will drill this into them."
 SBA_regional_maintain_the_flawless_legacy_desc: "We cannot abandon our roots. The militia organization that is the Black Army is one that is for and by the people. We cannot go back upon this legacy now. Abandoning this legacy would mean fundamentally changing the foundation of our society. Additionally, given that the military is so intertwined with our government, by instituting a top down structure of organization in the Black army, we would be inviting corruption and the threat of coup from the ruling generals in a newly reformed army. For the safety of our anarchic way of life, despite its faults, we must maintain our election based military."
 SBA_regional_welcome_the_rehabilitated_desc: "The Black Army has been supremely successful in its march of conquest across Siberia, but cracks are starting to show in the army. Our manpower reserves have been slowly atrophied as our reunification efforts have progressed, and we may not be able to rely on our home communes for many more men. In order to rectify this, we should begin integrating conquered militaries into our ranks. Not only would it alleviate our manpower issues, but it would also ease integration of their territory into ours considerably."
 SBA_regional_lessons_from_the_liberation_war_desc: "The wars we have fought in our efforts to reunify Russia were not one by sheer brute force and manpower, like those Russia has fought in the past, but rather with the cunning and finesse of smart generals and strategic thinking. We can use these reports and plans and draw on the experience of these generals and commanders to continue developing the military doctrines the old Soviet government had begun developing in the Second World War. Already, we have begun collecting and teaching the strategies used in the previous conflicts in our military schools."
 SBA_regional_industrial_warfare_desc: "The Great War of so many decades past was catastrophic not only in its casualties, but also in its material consumption. The lesson had been learned by all nations of the world after the war. The development of heavy artillery, tanks, and aeroplanes meant that wars of the future would demand a strong industry to support the militaries of the future. This theory has been proved correct. Our military conquests have only been possible thus far due to the hard workers at home pushing out thousands of guns, artillery, and planes month after month. Unfortunately, the farther our military ventures out into Russia, the large our military needs to become to defend our long borders. Thus, we must expand our military industry to keep pace with our industry."
 SBA_regional_reinforce_the_soldiers_desc: "The military machine continues to demand more and more manpower as we spread out across Russia. In order to sate this demand, we must boost recruitment in newly conquered territories. While volunteers have always been welcome from newly integrated territory, the amount of volunteers joining up was always tiny. Simply put, conquered peoples do not take well to their conquerors, even though we have afforded these people almost complete autonomy. We must begin a mass recruitment drive in the new communes and endear ourselves to the populace. With hope, we should see increased enlistment in the new territories."
 SBA_regional_following_the_falcon_desc: "Defeating Novosibirsk was no simple task. While their army might not have been as strong as ours, their air force certainly outshined ours. We suffered far too many casualties at the hands of enemy air support to ignore this problem any more. Thankfully, we no longer need to. Novosibirsk is home to one of the largest aircraft production plants in all of Russia, and consequently is also home to one of the largest air fleets in Russia. Additionally, this fleet will be serviced by some of the best plane mechanics in Siberia. The Free Territory takes another step into modernity."
 SBA_regional_black_wings_above_desc: "The Black Army has had little experience with aerial warfare in the past. While we have used some planes in combat in the past, simply put, we didn't have the industrial capacity or skilled airmen needed to operate an air force. Given our size and the relative strength of our enemies however, we must create and integrate a true air force into our military forces. We have a vast array of former pilots to educate the next generation of airmen, somewhat modern designs for airplanes, and the industrial capacity to begin manufacturing said airplanes."
 SBA_regional_experimental_helicopter_designs_desc: "Helicopters are one of the many technological advances made by the world while Russia regressed into infighting and warlordism. These strange flying devices are unlike airplanes of the past, in that they use a vertical rotor liftoff system whose benefits include aerial attacks on ground targets and even transporting troops and supplies to areas where a landing strip is not available. The devices have great potential, as seen from their performance in the South African War, and domestic development has already begun."
 SBA_regional_past_the_tachanka_desc: "Modern armoured and motorized technology has once again changed warfare for Russia. Formerly, our design had revolved around building large amounts of cheap tanks to overwhelm the German enemy. While tank production never reached the amounts needed to truly test this military doctrine, many generals had supported the idea of simply overwhelming their enemies. However, research into the tanks doctrines of Japan and Germany have indicated a focus on mobility and quality. We should strive to learn from their doctrines and designs and update our armoured and motorized military tactics."
 SBA_regional_tanks_for_peace_desc: "If Russia learned anything from the German invasion two decades ago, it was the utility and efficient brutality of mechanized warfare. Russian troops were cut up and overwhelmed by the speed and explosive power that panzer divisions had at their disposal. The failure of Bukharin to build a tank force capable of protecting the Soviet Union will not be repeated. Our neighbors have surely come to the same conclusions as us. Developing an armoured corps for the Black Army must become a priority if we wish to secure our borders."
 SBA_regional_compile_the_strategies_desc: "Despite recent efforts to reform the army and enforce some form of basic military doctrine, many officers end up implementing their own tactics or offensive strategy many times in opposition of what might be optimal. We should endeavor to create a unified military doctrine that our officers can follow in order to further whatever grand strategy is being implemented during any wars we might be involved with in the future.. This will allow us to get a better understanding of how the war is going and as to the capabilities of our troops, instead of simply hoping that an officer makes the right decision."
 SBA_regional_military_egalitarianism_desc: "One of the most outstanding features of the Black Army was its democratic military structure. Unlike most every other army, power was derived not from the top, among the generals and highest ranking military leaders, but rather from the lowest soldiers, who elected their own officers and promoted those who they thought were best equipped. The generals at the top of the military command structure are considered no more equal in terms of value than any other man in the military, and it is precisely because of this that our men fight as hard as they do."
 SBA_regional_the_tomsk_firearms_collective_desc: "While the people of Tomsk are well suited to our style of democracy, having already had local democratic structures they could use, they have yet to adopt the gun culture so vital to our defense. People either do not have the interest or the money to purchase weapons, and most did not feel the need to have one, feeling that their armies would protect them. Our presence here indicates that this was obviously not true. Thus, we should create an organization to educate the people of Tomsk as to the need and operation of guns."
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_liberation_desc: "The ultimate duty of Black army must be to spread our anarchist way of life to all of Russia, so that the peoples of creeds might be freed from the tyranny of states. More so than defense, we must prepare ourselves to be on the offense. Traditionally, conscripts signed up for the Black Army in order to defend our homes, not conquer others. We must convince them that in order to defend ourselves, we must liberate everyone else. Soon, all of Russia will fly the black flag."
 SBA_regional_an_army_for_self_defense_desc: "The purpose of our militias have always been to protect, not to harm. The Black Army is not like the terrorizing force of Yagoda. They fought for domination and power, we fight for peace and bread. Our past conquests should have little bearing on our future. In order to preserve the dignity and integrity of the Siberian Black Army and the Free Territory, we must prevent ourselves from following down the same tyrannical path our predecessors did, and perhaps in doing so we might finally find prosperity."
 SBA_regional_looking_outwards_desc: "Geopolitics is a game of diplomacy and tact just as much as it is armies and wars. In order to secure the Free Territories, we must assess our standing with our neighbors to the west and the east to assess whether they are a threat to us or not, and if they are to assess how much of a threat they pose. And, should we find ourselves to be fortunate to share a border with a nation friendly to the Free Territory, arranging some trade deals or defensive pacts might serve to benefit our interests."
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_liberation_desc: "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of global liberation. If an opportunity to support our fellow socialists or anarchist friends abroad, we should seize the opportunity to do so. Arms, funding, technology... If there exists a need, we shall strive to provide for it. Let us be the kindling that sparks the flames of revolution in all nations. It may cause us to lose reputation among our global peers, perhaps even spark aggression on their part, but if we can help liberate even one oppressed peoples, then we will know that our efforts have not been in vain."
 SBA_regional_a_policy_of_protection_desc: "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of protection. The last thing we need is to anger the likes of Japan or Germany and spark another war to devastate Russia. Should the socialists and anarchists liberate themselves from their oppressors, or begin a campaign to do in their own nation, they will have our full support, but not our weapons. Besides, nothing good can ever come of intervening in a foreign conflict. Just look at the United States, it's doubtful they ever expected to be in South Africa as long as they did."
 SBA_regional_exporting_the_revolution_desc: "In order to support our socialist and anarchist friends around the world, we will need to first find them. A new organization will be created, clandestine in nature and global in scale. Its purpose? To find and aid the revolutionaries of the world, even the ones that don't yet know they are yet. From just beyond our borders to the farthest reaches of Africa and South America, our men will be there, providing both the means and motivation for the people to liberate themselves. Some might call it propaganda, we prefer to call it the truth."
 SBA_regional_declare_a_safe_harbor_desc: "The world has become a harsh place. Across the world, individuals are being persecuted for race, religion, ideology, you name it. The Free Territory isn't like that. We are one of the few nations on Earth that can profess to be truly free. We must open our borders to the world and become the safe harbor of the world. So long as you do not intend to cause harm or havok within our borders, you are welcome to join our grand experiment. Additionally, immigration has its own benefits for us as well. The more numerous we are, the better we can protect ourselves."
 SBA_regional_an_eye_to_the_world_desc: "Russia is a harsh mistress, and our neighbors are even harsher. We need to know what they are doing at all times in order to defend ourselves. To that end, we must create some kind of clandestine organization to achieve this end. Should our neighbors begin mobilizing against us, we will know. If our neighbors develop new tanks and aircraft, we will know. If the leader of our neighbour country goes to walk his dog, we will know. With this new agency, the Black Army will have a hand in every folder and an eye on every nation."
 SBA_regional_solidarity_with_the_world_desc: "Building a spy agency is no simple task. It requires time and patience to build something so large and important in secret. Decisions to be made, directions to take. For example, defensive intelligence organizations are often operated and structured differently than more aggressive intelligence services. A focus on long term infiltration and surveillance may be more important than foreign instigation and smuggling. Neither choice is poor, just a different way in which to allocate your resources."

His sweeping authoritarian decrees and actions made our citizens question what anarchism even is. The situation was made worse by that fact that most citizens didn't, and still don't, know what anarchism actually is.

Most of our citizens can't even bring themselves to think of lands any farther than those immediately bordering their communes. This is something that has become rapidly apparent to Galanskov as he has spoken with more and more residents of the Free Territory. Inspired by the ignorance he's witnessed, he has written and published a book with his views and the opinions of others of anarchism and what it actually is in the Free Territory, in the hopes of making the ideology more clear to the average reader."

One should always remember that their fellow citizens in the Free Territory are anarchists just like them, and shouldn't ever be seen as the enemy, regardless of race, religion, or anything else. Instead, the average citizen should turn his attention to the General Assembly. Though it is an apparatus through which all citizens are to be represented, such power could easily be abused if a party or coalition gained too many seats.

The military grew ever stronger in power and hardly anyone stepped in to stop it. This will no longer be the case. Instead of the Black Army operating as a unit independent of the General Assembly, from now on the Army will be chained to the council. The General Assembly will now have the ability to remove or reshuffle generals and commanders in the army on a whim so that a general like Stepanov can never rise to the heights of power he came to ever again."

It's been almost a decade since the Siberian Free Territory came into existence, and almost two since we fled east during the Second World War, and yet, only a few months since Stepanov's coup changed us yet again forever. The world is changing so rapidly, and yet it feels like Russia and the people within haven't changed at all, discounting the bitterness so many now feel.

The vote of the smaller and more rural in the General Assembly has the potential to override the larger and more urbanized communes. Their interests taking precedence over those of others, something that is quite unacceptable if we are to continue calling ourselves anarchists.

A tool for the hateful to oppress the hated. A tool for the powerful to accrue more power. As long as such an apparatus exists, the people will suffer. That is why the Black Army will never accept such a thing. We will reject the fascists, the communists, the democrats, and all others who advocate for a state, whether big or small.

In fact, as a whole, the Black Army has become far more authoritarian and statist in recent years, taking liberties in governance and war that would not have been acceptable a number of years ago. We should inform the General Assembly of this fact and work to reform the army, because the way the army is currently operating is unacceptable, especially if we wish to remain a true anarchist state."

We expected that their crimes would be repaid, preferably through firing squad, but the General Assembly gave us a different response. They argued that killing these men was amoral and would set a bad precedent. Galanskov agreed, so from here on out these men will be serving as unpaid labor in the Free Territory, doing all the manual work needed in the army."

Despite the protests of the General Assembly, we have elected to administer justice ourselves. These traitors to the cause and to the general welfare will face the death penalty, by firing squad.

It's certainly the logical step to take if one wishes to completely and totally abolish any trace of a government, however, the Security Council offers a lot of benefits and we shouldn't be so quick to dismantle it. Though we loathe to admit it, the apparatus is great for organizing the Army and making tough decisions when it's warranted.

If we wish to ensure that such a thing never happens again, the institution must be abolished. Additionally, as long as such a council existed, the Free Territory was always in danger of creeping authoritarianism. While the anarchist ideology might be secure today, over the course of several years it might be eroded away by opportunistic generals in the council, until control over the nation was securely in their hands.

The General Assembly assumed that a greater level of interconnection between urban and rural communes would allow resources each are suited for to spread more easily between the two types of commune, Galanskov instead argues that such trade actually works to weaken smaller rural communes. Smaller communes won't need to grow larger if urbanized communes can provide the resources they need, thus, by eliminating trade between the two, you encourage smaller communes to grow larger."

And, by the same token, capitalists are naught more than fascists hiding behind the facade of goodwill. There are many among us today who would balk at that assessment, arguing instead that capitalism is good for the country, and would serve to improve the nation.

Thus, if we are to embark on the development of nuclear technology and weaponry, we must do so as a whole, drawing experience from all the communes, and giving everyone a chance to contribute.

Ivan Stepanov has taken our glorious effort to heights undreamt of, and he now reigns as the uncrowned king of this vast territory."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_deliberations_of_stepanov_desc: "Now that the Black Army reigns victorious over Siberia, there are important choices to be made. First and foremost, how must this land be governed? In order to shape the future of our territory, we must carefully balance the idealism of the original Black Army with the necessities and responsibilities of great power. Shall Stepanov seize unquestioned control, guiding our territory towards further triumph, but risking backlash for his challenge to our founding ideals? Or should he bide his time, acting with subtlety and paying the proper respect to the traditions which have brought us so far? This choice may determine the future of Siberia."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_put_on_a_good_show: "좋은 공연 하기"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_put_on_a_good_show_desc: "Without a doubt, we will need to tighten our grip on Siberia. But we cannot simply proclaim a dictatorship. The territory would rise up against us in an instant, and our agenda would be dead. Along with us. No, we must act with more subtlety than that. We should work within the established systems and traditions of the Black Army, and only begin sidelining the communes once it's clear that they have no hope of resisting us. Siberia will not be ours overnight, perhaps, but we cannot be rash about this."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_fighting_off_the_vultures: "독수리와 싸우다"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_fighting_off_the_vultures_desc: "The Black Army may have conquered the vastest, most unforgiving swath of land on the planet, but there are still many who see us as weak. From the proxies of Japan to the despots of western Russia, there are vultures circling, seeking to peck at our flesh. General Stepanov has therefore decided that the Black Army should begin a new campaign of public strengthening. There will be extensive recruitment drives, bold military exercises near the borders of our enemies, and we will even commission a new series of films for public consumption. The overall appearance will be one of strength, to cow those who would happily see us torn apart. In keeping with our anarchist traditions, of course."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_theres_only_room_for_one_state_desc: "Public memory can be a surprisingly malleable thing. Through new propaganda leaflets and posters, as well as some alterations to education curriculums across Siberia, we can start to establish a new version of history. In this new telling, Galanskov will be portrayed as a leader who was flawed at best, and whose ambitions would have brought down the Black Army as a whole. Meanwhile, General Stepanov will be portrayed as a visionary anarchist leader. He who controls the past, after all, controls the future. And this shall be our future."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mandatory_freedoms: "의무적인 자유"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_mandatory_freedoms_desc: "Years of the Black Army's conflict and struggle have produced a set of traditions forged in blood and fire. These traditions have, over time, solidified into laws customarily obeyed by the many communes of Siberia. Both common administrative law and higher ideals of human rights have been laid out, and it is our job to enforce them. Sending the Black Army, and armed auxiliaries, into the communes will make it clear to all that our territory is governed with both justice and strength. There shall be law, order, and liberty in Siberia, by whatever means are necessary."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_on_every_council: "모든 평의회에 장교를"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_on_every_council_desc: "The Black Army is the backbone of our territory. It has won us dominion over Siberia, and secured the wellbeing of the people against every despotic and reactionary threat. Not every resident of our territories is a soldier, though. Most live humble civilian lives on communes. However, they rely upon us for protection, and as such, we should require that the Black Army have more of a say in the governance of local communes and regions. By requiring every communal council to have at least one Black Army liaison, we can make sure that our interests are represented. It's for the good of all."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_ask_for_permission_first: "권한 요청 먼저"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_ask_for_permission_first_desc: "Years of the Black Army's conflict and struggle have produced a set of traditions forged in blood and fire. These traditions have, over time, solidified into laws customarily obeyed by the many communes of Siberia. However, some of those laws may have to change. By calling a convention of delegates from the many communes and regions, we can create a new code of laws. Such a code would grant us far more legitimacy in the eyes of the people, and is perfectly fitting with the anarchist ideal of the popular will. So long as the process is malleable, we can use democracy to achieve our own ends."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_advisory_communes: "자문 공동체"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_advisory_communes_desc: "The commune system forms the main unit of social order in our territory. Most people, be they farmers, artisans, or educated professionals, live in a commune system. For the most part, these communes have also formed the main unit of governance, with their councils deciding upon the allocation of resources and the administration of justice. However, this cannot stand. With the advent of the Security Council, and the realities of governing as vast a realm as Siberia, one thing is clear: hayseed peasants distributing harvests and levies is no basis for a system of government. The commune governments may have an advisory role, but the leadership of the Black Army will be doing the grunt work of administration from here on out."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_ascendancy_of_military_anarchism_desc: "The old traditions of communal governance are all well and good, but the world is a dangerous place. Those who would threaten us must fear our might. While we may fly the black flag, and while our soldiers may cite Bakunin, we are still an army. By blending the ideals of anarchism with dedication to protecting and expanding our gains, the Black Army will triumph. Military anarchism has ascended across our territory, and we will lay down our lives to defend it."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_keeping_the_generals_in_check_desc: "The Black Army may be run by those who claim the title of \"anarchist\", but it still has an officer corps. The Security Council is dominated by a handful of these men, a set of generals who have earned the loyalty of their troops through kindness and terror alike. We'll need to deal with them carefully. Each has their own set of flaws, and each their own virtues. And not all are worth keeping around."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_kilchichakovs_greed_desc: "Mikhail Kilchichakov is a liability. At least, that's his reputation. His main motivation for ascending to leadership in the Black Army is greed, and everybody knows it. He skims off the top of budgets and requisitions all the time. With that said, he's also competent. His administrative staff run large swathes of our territory with skill and aplomb, while Kilichichakov himself is a fine general. He will be loyal, useful, and while they may inspire some disgust, his excesses can be easily swept under the rug. Mikhail can be kept, as long as he doesn't prove himself to be more of an embarrassment than an asset."

At Council meetings, he often advocates for new enlistment, new equipment, and new offensives against the enemies of the Black Army. A charitable observer might call him enthusiastic. A less charitable one might call him a rabid madman, and we aren't exactly charitable ourselves. Still, Mishuernko is a highly capable general, who is, moreover, fairly loyal to us. Androniy can be kept, as long as his bloodthirsty eccentricities don't push us over the edge. But, what are the odds of that?"

 SBA_superregional_despotist_valenteevs_scheming_desc: "Stepan Valenteev is a threat. There is no escaping it. Valenteev and Galanskov were old friends and ideological comrades, and Valenteev likely sees himself as the natural successor. What's more, he's good at his job. Valenteev has distinguished himself on the field of battle, and commands the respect of many of the Black Army's rank-and-file. His experience and capability makes him too dangerous to have around. We must prepare to have him removed from the picture, in a deniable situation. A minor operation gone wrong, perhaps. A friendly fire incident. Something of that nature. The most important thing is that Valenteev must die."

When a course of action must be taken with the utmost precaution, lest that course become uncontrollable.\n\nThis is not one of those times.\n\nThe vast territories of Siberia which have come under our control must be broken to the will of Stepanov. Otherwise, the rabble of the Black Army will come under the control of men like Valenteev. That cannot happen. We must take control of the army and assert control over the BA, the communes, and all within our territory. The people will all say that we are dictators in the clothing of anarchists, but if we triumph, it won't matter what they say."

Too much dissent and disunity spilling out of the Assembly would pose a major risk to our political efforts. Therefore, we must dissolve the General Assembly and assume greater powers for ourselves."

They willl parrot any slogan you feed them, adapt to any situation you place them in, and, best of all, they can conform to any ideology that you steep them in. It is in the youth of Siberia that the future of the Black Army will be found, and it is on the youth of Siberia that our efforts must be focused."

If one is unwilling to die for their commune, and for the good of all their peers, then there must be consequences, and the conscription process, regrettable though it may be, is one such consequence. In communities where recruitment of volunteers is insufficient, we will hold lotteries to draft new levies for the struggle against outside tyrants. It will certainly save some money on higher education."

In our territory, one does not need a diploma or certificate to hold a rifle in defense of the Black Army's ideals. Our education system will reflect this. Obviously three-year-olds will be taught to count and so forth, but the only colleges we will need are officer academies. The serpents of reaction will be overcome by our swarms of ants!"

However, that doesn't mean that we cannot adjust our education policies to suit our most pressing needs. Primary and secondary curricula will be geared towards the skills that our territory needs the most, from engineering to medicine to militant anarchist theory. When the time comes, all students will be prepared for battle against the enemies of the Black Army, and that preparation will have come from the classroom and the training ground alike. After all, there will be no difference between the two."

This can be done through a variety of methods, but we find it best to introduce new youth programs into schools across the territory. These reserve corps for the training of officers will normalize the ideals of military anarchism, and prepare the youth to kill and die in the wars to come.

However, every society in the history of humanity, even stateless ones, has had to put some limits on freedom. After all, one cannot cry \"fire\" in a crowded theater. To permit infinite freedoms would invite chaos, and anarchism is not chaos. It is the people moving in lockstep towards higher triumphs.

They say that we have betrayed all of our ideals, and that there is no hope for an anarchist future anywhere in our lands.\n\nWe can change this.\n\nWe shall, therefore, declare publicly that the goal of the Black Army is continuing revolution, until Russia is liberated. Once Russia is liberated, however, there is still an entire planet that lies shackled by tyranny of all stripes. Man was born free, but from the fields of America to the prisons of Germany, from the cities of Japan's empire to the depths of Africa, he is in chains. So let us go to the people and declare that beyond Siberia, out there, is a new world!\n\nOut there is our destiny."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_leader_to_make_makhno_proud_desc: "It is finished. The vast realm of Siberia is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, within our control. In cities, villages, and communal fields alike, the people pledge their allegiance to General Stepanov. Their days are filled with work and strictly patriotic leisure, while their children drill with weapons behind their schoolhouses. Nestor Makhno himself, forefather of our efforts, however flawed he may have been, would be proud of what we have accomplished. Asiatic Russia lies under the flag of the Black Army, and Stepanov sits at the head of it all."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_the_peoples_stick_desc: "Why did America, that vast colossus of a continental superpower, surrender to Japan?\n\nWhy do the three great powers of the world stay in a perpetual standoff, with knives at one another's throats, but with no will to make the cut?\n\nWhy did the German Civil War inspire so much anxiety among the generals and advisors of the world?\n\nThere is only one reason: nuclear weapons. A power with access to nuclear weapons has the ultimate bargaining chip, and can threaten the annihilation of all with just a knowing word. A united Russia with nuclear weapons would be unstoppable.\n\nWe must have our own."

 SBA_superregional_despotist_zelenogorsk_has_much_to_offer_desc: "Siberia is well-known for its vast mineral resources, and as such, we have a number of options for where to source materials for our nascent nuclear program. One of the best options, in the view of the program heads, would be the Krasnoyarsk region. It is a fairly populous and industrialized region, and the facilities in the city of Zelenogorsk would be particularly well-suited to our purposes. The supply chains required for nuclear weapons development might be somewhat difficult to deal with, but Zelenogorsk remains the experts' top recommendation."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_black_army_mining_detachments: "흑군 채굴 파견대"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_black_army_mining_detachments_desc: "What with the Black Army's perpetual growth and somewhat bloated nature, we have found ourselves with quite a few soldiers with nothing to do at the moment. One of the best uses for such surplus populations is engaging in vital labor, and our nuclear program provides such an opportunity. While they will never fully replace civilian uranium miners, they will provide an essential boost to production. We can begin sending troops to mining facilities at places such as Khiagdinskoye and Elkon immediately. This is an excellent proposal to deal with any potential labor shortages, and will result in greater efficiency for our nuclear program."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_in_every_mine: "모든 광산에 장교를"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_an_officer_in_every_mine_desc: "It would appear that tasking soldiers to mine uranium in far-flung parts of our territories was less than ideal for the Black Army's esprit de corps. At the uranium mines in question, there have been reports of work stoppages, violence against supervisors, and rock-bottom morale. While we cannot ameliorate all of the problems that have led to this unrest, we can certainly crack the whip, as it were. We must begin sending new officers to the mines. Those trained in law enforcement and riot control should be prioritized. The uranium must flow, for the good of the Black Army."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_discovery_in_streltsovsk: "스트렐촙스크의 발견"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_a_discovery_in_streltsovsk_desc: "Far beyond our heartland of central Siberia, near the frontiers we share with the proxies and puppets of the Sphere, is the small mining city of Krasnokamensk. Much of the city's economy is based around the extraction of coal and manganese, but more recently, the mine technicians have come across something new: uranium. In the pits of the Streltsovsk Mine may lie one of Russia's greatest deposits of the stuff. Having access to this would be an incredible boon for our nuclear program. With that said, the mine is in the Far East, well outside our original stomping grounds. This would present new difficulties in mining, transport, and processing, to say nothing of potential labor shortages in a region so recently conquered. The risks of moving our nuclear program east are clear, but the potential rewards are immense."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_statists_of_siberia: "시베리아의 국가 통제주의자들"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_statists_of_siberia_desc: "The abundant resources of the Streltsovsk Mine are undoubtedly a positive for our nuclear program. However, there is one issue hanging over our heads: the Russian Far East was a warzone until very recently. While many of the civilian populations of the region have been integrated successfully, the scars of the fighting with fascists and statist communists alike run deep. We will need to act carefully in the Far East, and navigate the situation with caution."
 SBA_superregional_despotist_earn_your_liberation: "너의 해방을 얻어라"
 SBA_superregional_despotist_earn_your_liberation_desc: "There are still many thousands of captured prisoners from the conquest of the Far East in camps across the territory. Many, especially those from left-leaning factions of the conflict, have joined the Black Army, but many more adhere to various strains of fascism and White monarchism. Maintaining these POW camps is a strain on our resources, and they are a very tempting manpower pool. Furthermore, many of them would welcome the chance to earn their freedom, even if it takes digging up radioactive materials in a godforsaken speck of Central Asia. By giving these prisoners a chance to enter civilian life again, we would be killing many birds with one stone."

There are still many thousand of the bastards languishing in prison camps run by the Black Army, the detritus of fighting in places like Chita, Amur, and Magadan. They can be put to work mining uranium, but let's not kid ourselves. They won't have much of a choice in the matter. Instead, they will be given a taste of their own medicine.\n\nThe fascists would have strapped all of Russia to the yoke of serfdom once again.

 SBA_superregional_despotist_by_any_means_necessary_desc: "Our nuclear weapons program has succeeded. Within a matter of weeks, we expect to have our first pure fission bomb complete and ready for testing. While it cannot yet hold a candle to the vast arsenals of America, Germany, and Japan, it would still be a triumph without equal in the annals of Russian military history. The Black Army is about to split the atom, and capture the fearful eyes of the world. Congratulations."

"갈 준비는 됐나요?"\n\n유리는 사람들 앞에서 말할 준비가 되어 있다고 확신하며 어깨를 으쓱해 보였습니다. 만일 그가 하는 모든 연설이 씨앗이면 그는 하나의 정원으로 모든 러시아를 먹을 수 있습니다. 일상임에도 불구하고 뭔가... 하기가 싫었습니다.\n\n"또 생각에 잠기셨군요." 여자가 몸무게를 한 발에서 다른 발로 옮기며, "당신이 다른 사람이라면 나는 당신에게 무슨 생각을 하고 있는지 물어볼지 몰라도 저는 당신을 알아요." 여자는 유리에게 시선을 돌렸습니다. 두 사람은 조용히 같이 앉아 있었습니다. 여자는 심호흡을 했습니다. "유리, 그들에겐 당신이 필요해요."\n\n유리는 그녀가 옳다고 생각했습니다. 투덜거리며 그는 자리에서 몸을 일으키더니 문을 열어 아나키의 세상으로 발을 딛였습니다."

The boy nodded quickly. Stepanov gestured off to Galanskov, "For the sake of the Companion's desire to keep a good record of all meetings, I will allow the prospecting officer to recount his story."\n\nMikhail's eyes widened in shock, his mouth slightly open, ready for the words to come pouring out but finding the well dry. Mikhail took a few deep breaths and regurgitated the lines his father had prepared for him, "I oversaw the resupply of a commune at risk of famine, the situation was getting, uh, pretty bad." The sentence was more of a question than anything else, he spent the whole time looking to his father for approval and only receiving a cold, unloving, face.\n\nThen the worst possible thing happened. Questions began to roll in. First from Galanskov, "What was the response from the community?"\n\n"Um, great! They were really pleased! Small village, though, none of them could make it."\n\n Then Mishurenko,"And during this time did you notice any sabetours from the republic? Or the Soviets? Whoever was nearby."\n\n"Right...Well, not that I saw." Mishuernko frowned and the boy adjusted course, "but if I did they would've been shot on the spot!

Soon they would be in Krasnoyarsk too, shooting the men they mimicked. As of now, it didn't matter where they would be. Although it hung in their minds that this moment of laughter, of brotherhood, was fleeting. Although the unspoken inevitably that not all of them would return to this location wafted through the room like a cloud of smoke.

He turned around to the rest of his peers, who were similarly hunched over the yellowing map.\n\n"It's old but it's reliable, I brought pens." The man reached into his bag and retrieved six pens. "We can mark out the different communes from here." He uncapped his pen and immediately scribbled over the coat of arms of the house of Romanov, snuffing out the bird for good. "I suppose we can go alphabetically, what's the status of Berezh, Katerina?"\n\n"Less than ideal, we have been hit hard by communists to the east, ever so often, some bitter old men will cross into our land and burn it all to the ground. The Black Army has promised an increased presence but we've got nothing of the sort."\n\nThe man nodded, drawing a skull and crossbones over the commune, "Diverting from Zelenogrosk is a possibility, much of the industry there was left untouched." Thus became the pattern, for three long hours, the young Russians drew signs and stripes, painting a picture of a free land interwoven with arrows. Goods danced across the frozen tundra, springing from place to place, as the hunt for the perfect balance escalated. The man finally set his pen down and admired the work, it was messy, but well put together. It was organized chaos, fitting for the Free Territory."

The cold wind stung against his face but Andrey could not miss school under any circumstances, his mom had given him the lecture enough he could recite it from memory, "Listen to me you zasranets," she'd say, her voice sharp and grating, "You are the first in your family to get a proper education. You boy, you have the potential to become something great, so don't fuck it up!"\n\nFinally, the blinding white roof of the school peaked out from over the horizon, through squinted eyes, he could see the bikes of the other boys, carelessly crashed against the ground, around...something. It wasn't quite clear to him what, it looked almost like his father's truck. That was peculiar, not many kids got dropped, most were simply sent off into the tundra into the nearest place of higher learning. As he got closer, Andrey allowed his bike to coast, his mind was more focused on what on Earth a truck could be doing at school.\n\nAndrey dismounted and rushed inside, praying he wasn't late. "I'M SORRY! I WAS WITH MY MOTHER AND I-" Andrey noticed something amiss in his room, there was his teacher, Dmitiriviech's boy, and then a man, his head shiny and bald, but his mouth covered in a black cloth.\n\n"Welcome to class Andrey." Hissed his teacher, "Take your seat." Sheepishly, Andrey found his place and directed his attention forward. "As you may have noticed, we are joined by Companion Pytor, who will be making his home here for a while." Andrey furrowed his brow, why would they need the Black Army in school? Curious, Andrey shot his hand up, "Mr. Pytor, what do you do for us here?"\n\n"I make sure the bad thoughts don't get to you." Andrey wasn't sure what that meant, but it didn't sound good."

Still, Timofey persisted or rather, Mr. Smirnov persisted. He still wasn't used to that, being a Mr. The initial shock of being brought into staff had not yet worn off, it was still inexplicably odd to him that people looked up to him.\n\nEducation was hard work. The young man found respite in the break room chair and stirred his tea. Physically he had retrieved his pen and begun drafting his lesson plan for the next day. Mentally, he was back in the General Assembly, one amongst the rows of people tightly packed into the building. It smelled of rotting wood and sweat but felt exhilarating. He had been leaning forward in his seat, watching the fiery speaker gesticulating at the podium. His passion seeped out of him and dribbled to the floor, soaking in the floorboards and expanding outward to the crowd. Soon the creature swallowed Timofey's shoes, his whole body soon to follow. The speaker roared in the name of education, overwhelming Timofey in his drive.\n\nTimofey twitched in chair, a shiver down his spine bringing him back to the present. He looked around the simple break roam, only a table, a pair of chairs, and some tea. He wondered what made the man who spoke at the Assembly go into teaching, but Timofey had his assumptions. A teacher is a light, a guiding force for those in the dark and in a land consumed by darkness, Lord knew they could all use a little light."

We're still here fighting for the anarchist movement in our own sliver of Russia. Why don't you ever talk about that?"\n\nMishurenko kept his pace, not turning to face Ivan, "Are you accusing me of something, Companion Stepanov?"\n\nIvan shrugged, running a hand through what little remained of his hair, "Some would call it an accusation, I would be more inclined to call it hope."\n\n"Hope?"\n\n"Hope that you see beyond all this talk of anarchy and of freedom." Stepanov stopped in his tracks, making the general do the same, "Hope that you would support me unconditionally."\n\nMishurenko's face scrunched together in confusion but quickly softened in realisation. Mishurenko was a hero to the people but to the Black Army he was a legend, an ideal, a man who never stopped fighting.

It could be a promotion? It could be an accident? Egor stood up and straightened out his suit, placing the hat squarely on his head. Mishurenko did not make mistakes.\n\n"I came as soon as I received your letter, Companion Mishurenko." Egor fought the urge to wipe off his sweaty hands on his pants as he stood at attention. "I did notice your letter did not specify a reason for my arrival, Companion." Egor looked to the general in his chair for support but found none. "Not that there would need to be one! I act on the behalf of those I am honoured to call my peers, such as yourself, Companion Mishurenko."\n\nAndroniy Mishurenko looked at him with no clear emotion. His eyes droopy and mouth a straight line. "What had happened to Russians? When did they become this pathetic" He wondered aloud. Egor felt the familiar symptoms of anxiety build, his hands began to act independently, grabbing at his suit just for the feeling of stability. Mishurenko rose from his seat, "I have heard plenty about you, Egor. If the circumstances were any different, I would pity you. However, we live in the world we do, don't we?" Egor didn't answer.

Sheriff Lenoid Drozdov had considered it a blessing to be inside the prison during the occupation of the Black Army. That was until the prisoners caught word that the anarchists were coming and would likely bring freedom with them. The irony was not lost on him now. Him and the small detachment of guards had been trapped in the lobby, anarchists outside and inside. He was trapped.\n\nThe threat seemed to work, for now at least. As long as Lenoid kept his firearm pointed down the hallway the prisoners would not dare move. He wanted to breathe a sigh of relief but knew the slightest movement could be perceived as weakness and weakness would be capitalized on. "Sir?" A fearful whimper slithered out of the group.\n\n"What?" Lenoid kept his eyes trained on the hallway before him, his finger hovering over the trigger.\n\n"They're here." It required no explanation. Lenoid could hear it from behind him, the Black Army had arrived at the prison and was now waiting outside the building, preparing for the possibility of a siege.

They knew one thing, hatred. Freedom was tertiary. He shifted his weight, they should've done them in by now, at this point, it was a cruel punishment to be packed in here with the fellow members of the Social Democratic Party of Krasnoyarsk. Misha saw it then, the men walk on to the makeshift stage quickly assembled in the middle of the meeting hall turned prison cell. About time, Misha thought.

The barrel of a gun had made its home in the fat folds of the back of his neck, keeping him still. In his burning throne room, five men and a woman had surrounded him. He recognized one; Galanskov.\n\nGalanskov shouted something out to the others, the looters of his court, something Rurik did not wish to hear. His eyes betrayed his interests. He didn't need to hear what he said when he could see his son being dragged over by his shoulders. Rurik looked up to Galanskov, "Where is Lydia?" The words must've startled him, because Galanskov turned toward the king on his knees in an instant. "Where is my daughter?" Desperation began to creep into his voice.\n\nGalanskov offered a sad smile in return, "Nikolai Krylov, on behalf of the members of the Security Council, I should apologize for the rushed nature of this trial."

"Regardless of circumstance, today you stand accused of authoritarianism, the oppression of free gathering and unionization, and reactionary violence.

That was well and good but where was Lydia? "Nikolai Krylov, this council, with dissent, finds you guilty on all charges.You are to be placed in a detention center in a city to be determined." Galanskov found no joy in his words. Rurik felt the gun dislodge itself from his neck and hands appeared under his armpits, lifting him to a standing position.

The social democratic party was much more up his alley, but yet, whether he feared the repercussions or if deep down in his heart he saw the potential for greatness, Misha agreed to travel to the newly liberated territory.\n\n"Here."

 SBA.36.t: "Postage!"
 SBA.36.desc: "A letter arrived at the steps of our capitol this morning with the insignia of the Black Army stamped on the front. Initially believing it to be a declaration of war, Zavoloko was weary to even open it. However after the letter was double, triple, and quadruple checked, it was deemed safe enough to open.\n\nThe letter was short and concise, "Meet in Kansk to negotiate union." Ivan read the note aloud to his advisors, "What will we do?" asked the old man."
 SBA.36.a: ""I suppose we have no choice.""
 SBA.36.b: ""What are they gonna do, liberate us?""

 SBA.37.t: "The Expected Response"
 SBA.37.desc: "Ivan Zavoloko held his hands behind him as he walked down the aisle of the General Assembly. He looked all around him, scanning the building. It was like a church, the rows and rows of benches like pews. The altar at the far end of the room replaced with a podium. The choir stayed the same, though the people sang a different song now. The communists knew their design, the old man chuckled to himself. They probably didn't realize it, they probably didn't want it, but God was with them in the building.\n\nThe leader of the Old Believers nodded in respect to the members of the Security Council as his wrinkled hands gripped around the podium. It was like a sermon, but beyond that it was a plea. A plea for peace and measured integration.\n\n"I am a Russian. I have been a Russian since the day I was born and I will remain so after I die. I have seen Russia in peacetime, unlike many of the people in attendance here today." Zavoloko swept his arm out in front of him, recognizing each member of the General Assembly before him. "The people of Oyroita are hungry, despite all my efforts to feed them. The people of Oyroita are cold, despite all my efforts to clothe them. I want a future for my people. I have complete faith in the Russian people. If the will of the Russian people is anarchy then so be it." Ivan slammed his palm on the wood for emphasis.\n\n"Above all else, I want peace for my people. I want their children to be as blessed as I am to have been born into a time of stability. Peace and stability will not come from the long end of a rifle. Educate them. Educate me. Convince the people of Russia with your words and they will stand by you forever, convince them with your bullets and they will plot your demise." Ivan bowed his head, muttering a brief prayer under his breath."

 SBA.38.desc: "Sacha stood as one amongst thousands outside the gates to the city, Bitysk. His backpack weighed heavy on his back. He could not wait to get inside of the city and he knew the others couldn't either. The brigade of men had been freezing their asses off for what felt like centuries and were getting rowdy as a result.\n\n"What's the fucking hold up?" One man shouted over the voices of the thousands, "Companion Valenteev said we'd spend the night in the city and here we are losing fucking fingers to the cold!" A few men voiced their support but most kept quiet, just staring at the massive gate to the city, waiting for that glorious moment they would swing open and allow them in.\n\nHours passed and it never came.\n\nThe one dissenting man turned to tens and evolved to hundreds, snowballing quickly out of control. Attempts were made to simply break down the gate, to force themselves in, to no avail. "This is bullshit!" A soldier, drunk off the taste of revolution in the air, howled. "Is this some sick joke? March us all out here to waste away?"\n\n"I wish it were a joke, that would be less of a headache." From the entrance of the city emerged Stepan Valenteev. The brigade quickly fell silent. "Zavoloko has denied our request for integration." The sheer respect Valenteev commanded kept his men orderly as he delivered the damning news.\n\n"What are we going to do then, Companion Valenteev? Turn around and go home?""

 SBA.39.desc: "As the Free Territory continues to expand and modernize, more and more administrative roles are fulfilled by the Black Army.

 SBA.40.t: "Taking Control for Ourselves"
 SBA.40.desc: "With the Free Territory entrusting increasing power into the communes, the Black Army has taken a backseat to the leadership of the Siberian people.

 SBA.41.t: "The Ascension of the Security Council"
 SBA.41.desc: "Ivan Stepanov, the fat bitch. Ivan Stepanov, the operative of the state. Ivan Stepanov, the snake within the garden. In all honesty, he had hoped for a more creative title. Ivan Stepanov, savior of Russia? Ivan Stepanov, bringer of sanity to a land of madmen? Either would've been fine in his book, but those words did not pass the lips of the protesting people.\n\nIvan Stepanov sat in his usual chair, in his usual spot, in his Assembly. Galanskov could receive all the fame in glory, shout as loud as his voice would allow, be the father to Mother Anarchy, but what could he do besides that? Could Yuri Galanskov overcome the challenges of a decentralized hierarchy? Would Yuri Galanskov be willing to make sacrifices in the name of succes, of stability? Could Yuri Galanskov stop Ivan Stepanov?\n\nThe idea made him giddy, he felt like a character in a play. Shakespeare was what he pictured, but it felt more like a Pushkin play. Ivan Stepanov may have been the villain in the story but he was a character, a person to be followed by an audience, he had power. His power had only been expanded as he cornered Galanskov in his metaphorical game of chess. One motion blocked is worrying, two is cause for concern, but by the third, the Black Army and Stepanov stood atop the corpse of anarchy. There would be no more need for a General Assembly, for a free Russia. Russia was his and it would be shaped in his vision."
 SBA.41.a: "I win."

 
 SBA.42.t: "Commune Can Be Convinced"
 SBA.42.desc: "All of the communes within the Free Territory are dedicated to the values of freedom, equality and democracy, but naturally some divisions remain. Thankfully, the pertinent issue for a commune we have been courting is relatively minor - they are all but completely on board with us, and would require only a bit of convincing to vote for the proposed motion."
 SBA.42.a: "Let's talk."
 SBA.42.b: "Let's not."

 SBA.43.t: "Commune Requests Reinforcements"
 SBA.43.desc: "Recently, we have been engaged in talks with a commune over the possibility of supporting our motion in the General Assembly. They remain ambivalent, insisting that their security remains an unaddressed concern. Apparently, their militia lacks sufficient manpower to guarantee the safety of their people. Perhaps, if we were to send some additional men their way, they would feel secure enough to dedicate resources to backing us."
 SBA.43.a: "The Free Territory protects its people!"
 SBA.43.b: "Surely they can handle themselves."

 SBA.44.t: "Commune Requests Political Autonomy"
 SBA.44.desc: "In the Free Territory, all communes are equally represented. However, the matter of autonomy on a political level is another matter. Some communes, possessing more resources or larger populations, feel that they are unfairly constrained by others and are deserving of more freedom - in the true spirit of anarchist fairness, they claim. One such commune has approached us to ask for the increased freedoms which they feel they deserve. In return, they are willing to encourage their people to support our current motion."
 SBA.44.a: "Well, it's only fair."
 SBA.44.b: "Never! We are equal in all things!"

 SBA.45.t: "Commune Requests Funding"
 SBA.45.desc: "The issue of funding is a common one in the General Assembly. The fair and equal distribution of funds is not an easy task, and it is not rare for at least a few individuals to be unsatisfied with their share. Normally this could be blamed purely on flawed human nature, but we know the communes to be beyond such petty trifles. Therefore, the commune that has approached us asking for due recognition of their needs in the form of economic assistance is only doing what they believe to be fair and necessary for the wellbeing of their people - or so they claim. Were we to demonstrate our goodwill and belief in the spirit of fairness, they would be more inclined to support us in our present endeavours."
 SBA.45.a: "Anything for our companions."
 SBA.45.b: "This is naught but bribery!"
 SBA_45_tt: "Provides extra funding to this commune, the cost of §Y1 million USD§!"

 SBA.46.t: "Commune Requests Milita Training"
 SBA.46.desc: "The standards of the communal militia are not up to snuff - or so claims the commune we are currently in talks with. "Bandits have free run of our lands," they say. "Our people are fearful and undisciplined. They lack the training to defend themselves when danger comes calling." Apparently, some instructors, diverted from the main Free Territory militia, would go a long way towards improving the commune's security. They would be most grateful for services rendered."
 SBA.46.a: "Of course. We must stand together."
 SBA.46.b: "They have trainers of their own already."

 SBA.47.t: "Commune Requests Supplies"
 SBA.47.desc: "The material needs of the communes are many and varied; medical supplies, emergency rations, construction equipment, tools and so on. There never seems to be enough to go around, and some communes regularly find themselves short on crucial supplies at the most inopportune moments. One of the communes is currently in precisely that situation right now. If we send some supplies their way as a reminder of our dedication to mutual assistance, they would surely return the favor in turn."
 SBA.47.a: "Send them whatever they need."
 SBA.47.b: "We cannot show preferential treatment."

 SBA.48.t: "Commune Requests Economic Autonomy"
 SBA.48.desc: "Despite being a post-capitalist society, the economy is as important to the communes as ever. We have made headway in establishing total economic equality between all people of the Free Territory, but individual communes remain varied in their wealth. This is a lamentable situation, but difficult to remedy. Complicating affairs further is the insistence by some communes that they require more economic autonomy to attain the very equality we are working towards. This clashes with our values, but has some practical wisdom to it, and permitting it might make them more amenable to supporting our motion."
 SBA.48.a: "Of course. It is for the best."
 SBA.48.b: "Neo-capitalism in action? We will never support this!"

 SBA.49.t: "Commune Requests Weapons"
 SBA.49.desc: "Arms production has always run smoothly in the Free Territory, with each commune receiving no fewer guns than they need to defend themselves against bandits and reactionary encroachment. This is not the case according to one of the communes in the General Assembly, however. They claim that their arms supply has come up short in recent months, leaving their militia without sufficient weapons to defend their communities. Granted, there is no evidence of this, but if they have a need then it must be met - so they say."

Yuri had promised himself as a boy that he would never fall into the temptation of alcoholism that had taken his father from him. This felt like an exception. He would surely regret it in the morning, and would be quick to scold Yevgeniya for allowing him to partake in Stepanov's seemingly never ending supply of booze, acquired through means unknown to Yuri.\n\nFor now, that did not matter. Yuri, his glass still high in the air, spoke in slurred speech. "Companions!" The usual suspects turned to him, Yevgeniya, Stepanov, Valenteev, even Mishuernko had come to join him. "I think, I think..." Yuri trailed off, his eyes seemingly fixated on something in the distance.\n\n"Do you?" badgred Stepanov, "It doesn't really seem like it at the moment."\n\nYevgeniya playfully slapped Steanov's arm, "Oh be nice! It's his first time! Let the boy celebrate a little, now, we've accomplished a great victory.'\n\nValenteev raised his glass up as a toast, "No doubt about that." He gulped down the bitter contents of his glass, "We have all done something incredible here."\n\n"There is no turning back now." Mishurenko interjected, his drink untouched, "We will either retire in Moscow as heroes or die here as a mere stepping stone to the next regime, a footnote in the history of Russia."\n\nThe trio looked at the old general with unamusement.

 SBA.52.t: "To Unite Anarchy"
 SBA.52.desc: "Mikhail sat back in his chair, tired after a long day of reading reports and negotiating with local commune leaders. After 20 years as a leader and general in the Black Army, if he had learned one thing, it was that administering a territory was always harder than conquering it. One might think that allowing the communes their own rights and shifting the duties of governance onto them would make his life easier, but that never seemed to be the case. Mikhail found his office always filled with the sounds of fierce arguments as he clashed with commune leaders endlessly about how much material he could provide them and how many men he needed from their communes. It was a constant tug of war between him and the communes he had been assigned to protect.\n\nOn his desk lay lay a series of maps and files pertaining to some recently conquered territory that he had been assigned to administrate. Mikhail sighed as he sat up in his seat, picking up the main map outlining the new territory. Building communes from the ground up was never easy, and integrating them into the greater whole of the Free Territory was even harder. The task would necessitate yards of paperwork, and worse yet, he would have yet another communal leader to squabble with. On the flip side, the region was full of insurgents hoping to separate from the Free Territory. He could simply put the region under martial law and directly administer the new territory. He could establish that commune's elections later, and in the meantime, It would certainly make his job easier. Mikhail rubbed his eyes and pondered what to do."

Vadim had noticed the men come through town first one day as he had played in the field, coming and speaking with our local council. After a while, a few more men came with measuring devices and some sort of planner. He had learned to be suspicious of such government men whenever they came. They had only meant trouble in the past. Vadim shuddered as he remembered back to those days when Papa had been sent off to fight.\n\nSuch men were easy to spot. In a village of only 500, most everyone knew everyone. Yet, these men didn't look like the other ones. They wore blue coveralls instead of those green military coats, and they didn't seem interested in taking anybody away. In fact, all they seemed interested in was putting up these big wooden poles connected by the long black cables. Vadim was perplexed.\n\nStranger yet, on his way home, he saw more men in blue coveralls putting up this big box in the middle of town, and the entire town surrounding them as they tried to connect the black cables to the big box. Every seemed to watch in anticipation of something, but what that was, Vadim knew not.\n\nAll of the sudden, a click was heard as the cable connected to the box, everyone watched with bated breath as one of the men in blue coveralls picked up the phone. With just two words, it was as if he had set a firecracker off in the crowd. The townsfolk cheered and hugged each other as Vadim looked on, confused as to the meaning of the words. He twisted them around in his mouth and repeated them, as if to gain a better understanding."

 SBA.54.desc: "Yuri Galanskov dug through the filling cabinet before him. It would be under C, right? He was sure of it. He would never give the state credit but for what it was worth, they knew how to keep records. To his left, General Ivan Stepanov, his right, Mikhail Kilchichakov, and outside the room, demanding something be done about all the men sitting around, Androniy Mishuernko. There was some comedy to the situation, the key-members of the Security Council, the men responsible for the ascendancy of anarchism, pilfering around a college campus. It was very important to Yuri and Stepanov, but it didn't stop the two from seeing the humor in it.\n\n\"All that training worth while, Ivan? They ever teach you how to pillage a college in war school?" Stepanov only scoffed, continuing to go through the files before him. Galanskov chuckled to himself and continued to flick through the millions of papers occupying the cabinet.\n\n"Found something." Said Kilchichakov, producing a manila folder. On its cover was the proud symbol of the hammer and sickle. Stepanov took the document from Mikhail and flipped open to the first page. Curriculum of The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics it read, bold and spelled in capital letters. Stepanov handed the document to Galanskov who, at least, attempted to read each page diligently before Stepanov took the folder back.\n\n"You can read it on your own time, we have what we are looking for now. This along with all the other ones from the other college in this city should be more than enough for them to build an adequate curriculum."\n\n"Ivan, you're too quick to accept Soviet teachings, we can keep looking, I am sure we can find a curriculum here that suits the people's vision for the future" Galanskov said.\n\nStepanov shook his head and countered, "I hate them as much as you do, Yuri.

 SBA.55.desc: ""My husband and I were attacked." The man wiped tears from his eyes as he choked out the sentence. Another day, another speech to the mostly apathetic Security Council. Such was the joys of leaving the Free Territory open to all. The necessity of the speeches were often dubious at best, but it was still their right to speak, even if no action came. Today was unlike the rest, more than just the usual two members of the Council were listening intently. General Stepanov leaned forward in his seat, wheels obviously turning in his head. Yuri Galanskov, similarly, was listening intently but he wasn't alone.\n\n"We didn't even do anything! We were just walking to the grocer and he...he stopped to look at something in a shop, the owner came out and he was just shouting. He called us evil and a disgusting bastardization of the Lord's image. It was just something dumb. The guy was selling flowers and well, he loves flowers. We run the largest garden in our commune actually. I'm sorry I am rambling."\n\nStepanov dropped his pen on his desk and shook his head. "I am not gonna force you to explain anymore. What happened to you is disgusting and should never happen to anyone in this free society." Yuri's head swayed from side to side as he considered the traumatic experience. It was the couple's right to do as they pleased but it was also the right of the man to shout was it not? Yuri, usually overflowing with things to say, was usually silent.\n\nLuckily, Companion Valenteev spoke for him. "What happened to you is horrible, I could not wish that upon my own, however, I do believe it is firmly his right in this society to not only deny you service, but voice his opinion on your practices. Bickering quickly broke out between the members of the council, with most agreeing the shop owner was acting out of line, but the division spurring about whether it was his right to deny someone due to their sexuality.\n\nFinally, Stepanov commanded silence. "Companions, we must see this as not a lone issue, but a larger one that threatens to tear apart our Territory as a whole. I motion to make it a priority of this body that we end injustice on every level, even in personal.""

 SBA.56.desc: "Mikhail Kilchichakov scanned over the proposal on his desk. The plan, authored by Stepanov, seemed like his usual schtick. Mikhail cared very little for anarchism, even less so for Stepanov. Mikhail liked numbers, numbers made sense in a world where nothing did. Even if he had never read Bakunin or and only heard of Makhno in passing, Mikhail knew how to make things work and even Yuri had to admit it every now and then.\n\n"That's a lot of zeros on this figure here, Ivan." Mikhail said, peering over his glasses, "I am not gonna bore you with the ideological implications of your little anti-poverty, or shall I say, anti-Galanskov, proposal here. What's more important to me is how you want to bring this about when I am already differing a sizeable portion of our budget to keeping your boys stocked up with the most up to date guns money can buy."\n\nStepanov leaned forward, folding his hands on Mikhail's desk, "I assure you Companion Kilchichakov what I am offering is not only feasible but it is necessary! We ought to be actively redistributing the wealth to the people! Think of how many lives we could be saving and improving with this landmark agenda!"\n\nMikhail sighed and shook his head. "Cut the shit, Ivan. I am not Yuri, I am not gonna be swayed by the people's struggle or whatever you call that horseshit you just spouted at me. I'm looking at this from a solely pragmatic point of view, that's my job yeah? I balance the books, you shoot the reactionaries. I don't see why you are even here, the current system of communal self management works fine. They take the money they need and put it where they see fit, why do we even have to get involved in the whole process."\n\nStepanov scowled at Mikhail, visibly angry, but not willing to drop his act just yet, "It's important to not only myself Mikhail but to the army as well. Think about who's families this will save. Think about what they will think if the news breaks that Mikhail Kilchichakov shot down this agenda all the while accruing a not-so-small fortune."

He breathed in the cool air of the city, the city he built, that he loved, the city where it all begin. He sauntered to the gate, so many engravings on it from so many expeditions. It began to set in with him, this was real. Him, Yuri Galanskov, was forging a new Russia hand and hand with his communal brothers. It felt so...final. There was no going back now, he had lead too many armies, too many had died. He must charge ahead at full speed now, inaction now would spell the death of the anarchist movement. Yuri pushed off from the gate and continued his walk to the General Assembly.\n\nThrowing open the doors, Yuri saw the usual suspects, Stepanov at his desk, writing something. Valenteev gesturing to a map decorated with cities labeled friendly and opposed and Mishuernko attempting to cross out all the ones labeled friendly. And hundreds of other people, chatting about the assembly hall. Yuri smiled to himself, they were a rag-tag bunch. He found that fitting for the torchbearers of anarchism, it ought to be a movement of many people from all backgrounds. Yuri shook hands with Valenteev and nodded in respect to Mishuernko before taking his seat on the bench.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, as the last of us trickle in on the chilly Siberian morning, I would like to say a few words before we begin." Galanskov stood in awe of the crowd, of the movement."What we have done here is what the nightmares of Tsars and fascists alike are made of! We have stood up, together! Through our loyalty to each other we have freed our people of the tyranny of the state, but much more is to come. We have a lot before us, I can tell you it won't be simple or enjoyable all the time. It will be hard. All good things in life are fought for, not handed to us. We have fought for freedom here but I cannot sleep at night, companions, knowing there is still so much work left to do."

She fiddled with the papers, smiling awkwardly to the security council, her pearly white teeth nearly blinding many of its members. Yuri gave her a nod and the blonde haired woman began speaking.\n\n"Good morning ladies and gentlemen of Kansk! My name is Sofia Petrova, I was a wealthy upstart from the city of Tomsk." She paused for a second, trying to gauge the audience reaction. "My life revolved around administering my father's business, caring for my two lovely girls, and expanding my knowledge with the night classes I'd attend. All three of which were taken from me." Sofia's smile flickered for just a second, like the flame of a candle being blown on. "I am not here to give you kind folks my sob story," the woman said, retrieving a silk handkerchief from her pocket and dabbing at her crystal blue eyes. "I'm here to say there is good in the world. That not everyone in that city was evil. I have wholeheartedly accepted that this is simply the way things go! You know?" The woman laughed a little too hard to the silent audience. Sofia, not missing a single beat, continued on. "I know you are angry and that you want justice, I want justice too, but I ask you show mercy in your justice. Tomsk was pillaged. We lost everything. We are willing to not only live within this land, but love it, we yearn to experience your brotherhood. My only caution," Sofia offered a pathetic half smile, "let the people build equality, don't thrust it upon them."\n\nSofia descended the podium, her head down as she returned to her seat. She crossed her legs and put on her biggest grin, she knew in some communes they would've shot her just for saying she administered a business.

What so many forget due to their unwavering commitment to God is the role of the Church. On surface level, one would be hard pressed to guess the church as the root of all evil, but it wouldn't be too far from the truth.\n\nBelieving in God is opposed to the anarchist mindset in and of itself. To be a servant of God is to be in doubt of the power of the individual above all else. Those who draft the different versions of the Bible take the chance to manipulate the people's will to their own. As the centuries have passed, the world of God, if it even existed has been twisted and mangled to the point it is hardly recognizable. A free land means freedom from all tools of the state, to which the church is just one of many.\n\nThat being said, the motion to confiscate the wealth of the church was one of brutal debate with the priest of Kansk engaging in a multiple hour long debate with Galanskov over the use of the church for good and for evil. In the end, the Security Council voted unanimously to handicap the church, de facto sealing them off from the General Assembly."

This city is where it all began, where he first protested against the Central Siberian Republic's hypocrisy, where he organized a revolt, where he developed a friendship with Ivan Stepanov, a man he would've disdained. He supposed that was the beauty of anarchy, he didn't know what would come next. He certainly knew would he would like to do, but would he ever achieve them? He was unsure. He had heard reports from both the east and west, neither were promising. In the middle of them both, was the Free Territory, the safe zone between the statists. They would most certainly send their planes and tanks, but what they would falter on is their message. A person will not become a fascist or a socialist if you shoot them long enough. What changes people is words, a uniquely human trait.\n\nGalanskov saw the thousands crowding the city square and he saw hope, a people who had seen enough suffering for their lifetime. They were going to decide the fate of Russia, the people before him, it was up to Yuri to help guide them towards good. "Companions! Those of you who are joining us for the first time and those who have followed us since the beginning, I welcome you." The people began to applaud, some chanting his name, something that didn't sit right with Yuri. Regardless, he continued on. "Today the greatest struggle to come to Russia enters its next stage.

Yuri smoothed out his suit and stretched, standing up from his seat. It was nice to have something to ground him in reality. He could barely believe how everything had changed, like a train barreling it's way down the tracks with the breaks cut. They had to run out of rail eventually right? One day the people would realize that killing everyone in a mob would not be the solution to their problems, surely. He wouldn't be the one to find out. Yuri stepped off the train. Here he was. Biysk. Yuri looked around for any sign of civilization, he was the only one stepping off the train after all. He had been briefed that the city was a backwater, it was his job to do his best appraisal, see what was good as is, what could be improved, and what had to be scrapped entirely. Before the collapse of, well, everything, Yuri did the same job, just often accompanied by armed guards and motivated by a large pay. Now, he was alone, in anarchy, looking out at a bunch of sheep farmers, tasked with turning the city into a metropolis. Yuri walked around the "city", if one could even call it that. For the most part the rural people of Biysk kept to themselves, which made gathering info difficult. He saw a bar in the distance, the only thing more common than the rail in Russia. Yuri walked in, set down his briefcase and began jotting down his notes. Abruptly, he felt a tap on his should.\n\n"Hey stranger, Who are you?" The barkeep asked.\n\nYuri cleared his throat before answering, "I'm just doing surveying the town! Just a little research for the eggheads in Novosibirsk!" Yuri laughed awkwardly. Damn it, why was he being so awkward?\n\nThe woman smiled despite his nervous demeanor and said, "Well Yuri, I hope you say good things about us, we don't get the love we deserve." The woman winked and walked away, leaving a stunned and confused Yuri alone with his notes. He shook his head and looked back at the paper, but the words were blurred. He looked back at the barkeep, conversing with an elderly man. The two shared a hearty laugh. Yuri swallowed and picked up his pen again, writing a simple phrase."

It's not just the Black Army that defends us, it is the people in the factories and those willing to march in the streets to spread our message!"\n\nDanil smiled politely, he didn't bother with these types. He didn't hate where he lived, didn't like it either. Like most in Kemerovo, Danil was just trying to get by. He worked at the steel mill until six, he picked up his dinner, and returned home, ready to settle down for the night and do it all over again. He didn't care much for liberation this and people's justice or struggle or whatever the buzzword this week. "Hey, I appreciate it, but I'm ok. Thank you, enjoy the rest of your night." Danil began to close the door but was stopped when the uninvited guest, quite literally, put his foot in the door.\n\n"You may be ok but how is your neighbor? Your family? The issue with cities can sometimes be apathy, I'm sure you understand that?"\n\n"Uh yeah, I mean, I guess I do but-"\n\nWhat you may not understand, companion, is how integral you are to the bigger picture. The regimes before you saw you as a number, a line on a chart. I'm not here to bug you or ruin your night, I apologize if I have." The man pulled his foot out of the door, testing to see if Danil would close the door on him.\n\n"N-no, you're fine. I was just tired you know, got off work and everything." Danil said, leaving the door open. The man took his chance, stepping in through the door, pamphlets in hand. Danil stammered some kind of objection out but the man had already entered, discussing the opportunities before him. Danil sighed, if this was gonna be how life was from now on, might as well make the best of it."

On the other hand, it did mean that he had a much higher chance of getting caught and the people's justice was not likely to grant clemency to a thief, no matter how young he was.\n\nFydor swam upstream against a current of bodies, mumbling less-than-half hearted apologies as he struggled against the general direction of the crowd. Jesus, he thought, what would drive this many people out here? He had been plundering the city square, bit by bit, for years now and could assure the people here that this town held no good worth coming out here for.\n\nFyodor ducked into an alley, desperate to avoid the suffocating power of the sea of people. He peaked his head out of his hiding spot just enough to see the people's destination . A large crowd had amassed around city fountain, around the figure who stood atop a pedestal of boxes.

Her husband only scoffed, setting his notes from the assembly on the dinner table. He shook his head as he walked to their room, kicking off his shoes by the door. She peered over from the side of the table she was sitting at and scanned over the notes. "Did Yuri really say that? I mean Aliyev, you understand that this is not a victory for us right? You've got a kid and a half!" She rubbed her enlarged stomach, the thought of her husband being responsible for the house was one issue, running an entire worker's co-op fit to challenge the industrial might of the east and west was an impossibility.\n\nAliyev rounded the corner back into the kitchen, his tie dangling loosely around his neck. "The Siberian Plan was a disaster, Anastasiya! I know you are smart enough to recognize that! It trampled workers rights in the name of security. Security, which for the record, never came, I mean just look where we are now."\n\nAnastasiya messaged her forehead, why was her husband such a brute? Not everything was an ideological struggle, sometimes the politics of a decision mattered much less then the pragmatic effects. "Aliyev...you're going to have two children rampaging throughout this house. I can't do this alone. I understand this means everything to you, it means so much to me, but not everything is a battle." She stood and walked to her partner, planting a kiss on his cheek.\n\nAliyev digested the message, debating it within his head. "Anastasiya, my love, you know I would do anything for you.

They didn't see the people they walked past, such was the nature of the metropolis, even in an anarchist society. Tihomir didn't like that. Surely people weren't hardwired to hate each other? The success of the Free Territory proved that, people cared about other people. That's what he told himself as he shivered outside of the busiest store in the city he could find. He didn't acknowledge as people walked by while he struggled to set up, he didn't find it troubling when nobody stopped to inquire why he was outside a business with a table and poster board in the middle of a snowy evening. He knew that once his booth was set up, the people would fill the streets with lines, eager to contribute.\n\nHours passed, Tihomir sipped at his coffee to keep himself warm as people passed. He watched them all, he tried to notice them, just to see if they would notice him. Something about the city vexed people, they were focused on where they were going, what they needed to purchase, and nothing more. Maybe if they just needed a little nudge? All social change need little nudges. "Good evening! I have been collecting names for the charity my commune is organizing.\n\nThe woman, obviously annoyed but trying to avoid confrontation, smiled.

I believe it is our duty to provide for our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter where they are from!" The woman recoiled, obviously shaken. She looked around for support, someone to free her from the clutches of the man grabbing her in the middle of the plaza but found people continuing as they were, unbothered.

Still, such an important title would only carry him so far in life, what he really needed was to learn how to read.\n\nShe pulled open the door, wished her son the best, and practically pushed him out into the Siberian wasteland. Yanya stood on his porch for a while, simply staring at the stars above him. He wanted to know more about them. How did they get there? Who put the stars where they were? He hoped he'd figure out at his lesson. Yanya traversed the village, walking past the houses of all his neighbors, their children nestled snug in their beds.

It was Alexi's turn to roll his eyes now, not finding the same humor as his friend. "Don't believe me? Get in!" The young woman slammed the drawer shut with her hips and retrieved the keys off the wall. "Catch!" Nearly hitting Alexi square in the face, she tossed the keys to the dumbfounded boy taking up all the good space in her garage.\n\n"Julia, come on, this is ridiculous! I mean..." Alexi looked at the vehicle and then to the keys and then back to his friend. A slight smirk formed on his face, "If you say it works. If I am right though, I get to tell the Security Council all your secrets so they can torture you!" Alexi giggled as he ran to the passenger door."

Surely he must have at some point but as much as Valenteev sifted through all of his memories, he couldn't find the faintest image of Stepanov's teeth. Well he'd never need another one, the man was all smiles now as he read over the document. "I love this. You two built this?" He swung a fat finger between Valenteev and Mishuernko.\n\nMishuernko, the vain old bastard he was, jumped to claim the credit, "Well it was drafted by myself, I just had my Companion give it his seal of approval because of rank."\n\nStepanov raised an eyebrow looking to Valenteev. "That's bullshit, Companion Alzheimer's has no idea what he's talking about." Valenteev rebutted.\n\n"Very classy, attack a man for his age. For his experience. I served valiantly for freedom against the Nazi tyranny and I do the same today." Mishuernko boasted.\n\nStepanov shook his head and removed his glasses, "I don't care who wrote which words, what matters here is that this doctrine is solid. Good work both, or either, of you."

He made a small incision into the wall, matching with the other twenty-seven. One for each appeal. He found it a good way to keep track of how many times he had been wronged by the corrupt Security Council but also it was to send a message; people don't tolerate self-serving governments, especially around this part of Russia. He looked up to the clock on the wall, it would be any min-\n\n"Nestor?" A fair skinned secretary poked her head out from a pair of thick white doors, "The Assembly will see you now." The assembly? Had she misspoke? He booked his appeal meeting with the Security Council, he was sure. That's the way he had done it twenty-seven times before, at least he thought. They began to blur together after the tenth. She was probably mistaken, the buildings housing the Security Council and the General Assembly were merged during the move to Novosibirsk. Satisfied with his answer, Nestor rose from his seat with a grunt, pulled open the doors and walked in.\n\n"Companion Nestor," If this was the Security Council, it had gained about a hundred or so member over night, "I hope your wait wasn't too long." Nestor mumbled something, dismissing their concern. "Well, it looks like you're in the for your...twenty-seventh appeal? Is that right?" Nestor nodded his head. "Well your record seems to fit the bill of an officer. You served gallantly against the Red Army in Mongolia and continued to advocate for anarchism since." Nestor was in shock, not only were they not immediately disregarding him, the people of the General Assembly seemed eager to welcome him aboard.

Come on, show of hands." Nearly the entire room of engineers, artists, and scientists begrudgingly raised their hands. "Oh, don't lie to me now! There's no way you all knew that! Ok, liars, let's breakdown the gun to its essential components." The instructor began to disassemble his gun on the table.\n\nIn the back of the room, the former poet Yaromir nudged the person next to him with his shoulder. "Hey," He said, "Do you have any idea why we're here?" The man, focused intently on disassembling his gun, ignored him. "Hey." Yaromir nudged him again, this time harder.\n\n"Just watch what he's doing." The man spat, continuing to tinker with his weapon.\n\nGeez, Yaromir thought, what's wrong with these people? Were they so obsessed with their tools of destruction that they forgot what matters most; basic human decency? Something washed over him, he must call out this injustice, even if it was small. He rose from his seat and stepped up onto the table. "People of Tomsk! Lay down your arms! Remember what we stood for! The future! These murder machines are not tools of peace! Rise now!

It fit Yuri very well, even if she thought the room was a little, well, big for him as she put it. From all her years accompanying Galanskov, Yevgeniya knew one thing about the man, he was certainly larger than life. Her window gazing was interrupted by the sound of boots clicking the tile floor. Yuri was here.\n\n"Sorry, Yevgeniya. Got caught up at the Congress, I hope I didn't keep you waiting for too long?" Yuri removed his coat, hanging it up on the rack next to his desk.\n\n"Oh no, Yuri, no need to worry, I was just appreciating the view."

There's people who have enjoyed more freedom than ever before, people who are not dreading, but excited to raise a child in this new society! At the same time, there are so many still living under the authoritarian jackboot." Yevgeniya could see his face tense up in the reflection of the glass.

She had spent the better half of her career in Russian politics drafting the groundwork for the agency, for her agency. Yevgeniya had experienced doubt her whole life, doubt she could lead, doubt she could even perform the simplest of task, all because of her gender. Not only did this make her one of the founding members of the free Territory, it gave her a foresight like no other. The enemies of Russia were not to be found just beyond the Urals or in the port of Magadan. The enemies of anarchism were the superpowers of the world, those who sought to preserve the status-quo. To maintain a free territory, the international threat would have to be addressed first and foremost.\n\nThe board of men before murmured between each other, pointing to certain lines of the proposal with their pens. Yevgeniya broke the silence, "I trust everything is to your liking?"\n\nStepanov removed his glasses, "Page twelve strikes a chord with me, Ms. Taratuta. You write, and I quote, that the members of this agency uphold an oath to protect the continuation of the revolution at any cost. Can you elaborate on that?"\n\n"I had a feeling you'd ask, Companion Stepanov. It is my firm belief that this organization's top priority is to assist in our crusade to liberate the people of Russia. By extension, this means safeguarding our pre-existing communes. The biggest threat in my eyes, Companion Stepanov, from my experience in working with some of the neighboring states, is that of the international powers.

He didn't know the first thing about what happens in the far east and yet he had the nerve to talk down to her like she was some insolent child. She was ready to tear apart Stepanov limb by limb, yet her years of diplomatic experience gave her restraint.\n\n"Our very worst enemies, Companion. The White Army, parading around on horses, touting some Tsar they've stolen from a far away land like the previous century never happened. Chairman Yagoda, who I am sure we are all familiar with, based his operations not too far from our initial base in Kansk. Not to mention literal fascists who attempt to spread the Nazi plague from the east. To say we need to focus our attention outwards, Companion Stepanov, is an insult to all we are fighting for. We have made significant progress, yes, this is true, but all of that can be ripped away from us at the drop of a shell casing if we waste our money and resources on fruitless endeavors in America!" Yevgeniya panted. So much for her diplomatic training.\n\nLuckily, Yuri interjected, before Stepanov could lecture her back.

Maria's heels clicked on the tarmac, she walked with purpose, but more importantly with zeal. How could she not flaunt herself? When would she get another chance to wear a dress? She stuck a stick of gum in her mouth and took the sunglasses from her purse and put them on. On the right lens of her glasses was a small symbol, an A with a line straight through it. She was instructed to find the circle that matched the design and to wait there, flipping through a book.

In that intense moment of first meeting, the brain is hijacked, all senses thrown to the wayside. Who needs the senses anyways?\n\nLove is pain. A battered and broken creature that has suffered too long inside your stomach. It yearns for freedom, for a miracle, to escape from it's cage.

It rips open it's chest and pulls out it's beating heart and demands its partner shatter it to the ground and turn away as its pieces scatter into the wind.\n\nLove is forgiveness.

He observed himself in the mirror adjacent to the entrance to his dacha. He grabbed at the fat on his fat, pulling at it. He dropped his shoulders. He was getting far too old for this. How long had he been fighting? How long had he been acting? How long was he going to wait? The general shook the thoughts from his head, it was a long game worth playing, nobody who ever rushed to power stayed in. As he walked to his bathroom he let out a groan, his knees were giving out on him, too little years spent charging into battle and far too many spent planning them. Ivan turned on the faucet, still hung up on the conundrum that had plagued him for years. On the other hand, those who waited for power did not get long to enjoy it. Stepanov cupped the cool water in his hands and brought it to his face.\n\nThree knocks came from the door. Stepanov sighed, letting his head lean against the wall. What could it be now?

"What do you need?"\n\n"Good evening Companion Galanskov, I apologize for my tardiness, I just enlisted! I came from out east, still getting myself acquainted" Stepanov raised an eyebrow to the man, he knew naivety, he could see it from kilometers away, taste it in the air. He loved it.

Valenteev was uncompromising but passionate, not just bitter like the assholes where he came from. He fought for what he believed in, that was something Marko could look up to in a commander. He was not only willing, but eager, to lay down his life for Valenteev, for his commune. God it felt so good just to have a purpose. Marko did not see combat however, he saw his companions set up tents as he climbed in the truck. He had never met Companion Galanskov but his name was unavoidable. When Dimitri gave him the address of the commander of the Black Army, he felt giddy to meet Companion Galanskov, but found him irritable.\n\n"Of course, Companion Valenteev. We are under orders from Companion Galanskov to go straight to Lesosibirsk."\n\nValenteev furrowed his brow, "Seriously? That's what he said? Well then," Stepanov took the googles from his forehead and pulled them down over his face. "Let's go."\n\nArriving in the commune of Lesosibirsk, Marko could immediately sense something was amiss, the way people poured out of their houses, standing outside and just...staring. Valenteev was visibly uncomfortable. He spoke to one of the members of the commune, something Marko couldn't really hear. He tried to claw his way to the front of the pack to stand next to Companion Valenteev. Why had they sent so many people? By the time he reached his commander, there was shouting. Whomever Valenteev was speaking to had drawn his weapon. The people on their front lawns holstered weapons of all kinds as well, shotguns, rocks, bottles, whatever. Valenteev began to back away, but the crowd was too rowdy. Someone, in the crowd of Black Army soldiers, or from the commune fired.

Somewhere deep within his heart, somewhere where even he could not find it, what Yuri wanted nothing more was to die free, to not share the same fate as his father or his father before him. Siberia was cold and unforgiving, it was something he learned at a young age and kept with him all his life. It was a place that cared little for want or wishes. Siberia delivered.\n\nGalanskov, the caged anarchist, paced around in the back of the transport vehicle. Shackles followed him, rattling, reminding him he was enslaved, taunting him, their metallic jingle a cruel laugh. How funny. An anarchist locked in a box. Very funny indeed Ivan.

Scared of what he had accomplished, something that he had set in motion, even if he would rot in prison, his message had been made and the world would never be the same. However, if his reputation was an annoyance, might as well live up to that.

There was no confusion, he certainly didn't like them, but was he afraid of them? Did he hate them? That question was more nuanced, and certainly not the one General Ivan Stepanov pictured he'd be thinking as men and women alike kicked at his ribs.\n\nHe couldn't hear much, maybe because his head had been savagely beaten, maybe because he didn't want to. Stepanov built his head like a fortress, locking himself in and others out. For decades, that was how he lived, a constant inner monologue with himself, planning his eventual assault from the fortress. The moment he let the drawbridge down to charge is the moment his castle crumbled. He had waited so long. Put up with so much "companion" this and "stateless" that. Who gave a fuck?

Yet, the only thing Stepanov heard were the chants of the raging crowd before him.\n\nStepanov the general died in the Security Council. Stepanov the schemer died as the people saw through his act.

Modifications in order to allow them to comfortably sling their rifles had been expertly integrated.\n\nThe 'priest' arrived second, his clerical uniform stained and submachine gun scuffed from the day's entrenchment training. And the guests arrived third, each forming up behind their commune's bride and bearing the marks of their own daily militia activity.\n\nAlthough the communes agreed on the need for collective action against enemies without, in truth there was much tension between them, put aside only enough to ensure that this special moment for their respective daughters was not interrupted. In short order, the 'priest' officiated and the brides exchanged vows, both to the Black Army and to each other, before sealing them with a kiss.\n\nCheers quickly turned into jeers, however, as with the ceremony itself now completed and the alcohol brought forward, long-standing disputes emerged once again. One guest swung at another from the other commune, who responded by dislocating his arm. The priest struck a reveller with a thrown bottle, knocking him flat. A general brawl followed, though all were careful not to use their weapons.

I understand you're torn" She placed her wrinkled hands on his chest. "We've come too far now. You have to speak to them, I know you will. You will always do the right thing, Yuri. You aren't him." The phrase struck a chord with Yuri, his face twitching slightly.\n\n"Thank you, Companion Taratuta." Yuri pulled the coat tighter around himself as he moved for the door to the balcony. Yuri gripped the doorknob, before he even stepped out, Yuri could hear their cheers. They sung his name, demanding to see Companion Galanskov, defender of the revolution against the snake general, Stepanov. Yuri took in a deep breath, turned the knob, and stepped out into the brisk morning air.\n\nYuri nodded politely as he waited for the roaring applause to end. It felt different. This was the treatment fascists received and Tsars envied. Why was he here? The answer was in the admiration of the people below him. They chose him. They trusted him. Yuri was not to let them down.\n\n"Companions!" He called, "Today we pass the second test! With our combined might, we toppled the authoritarian states of Siberia! We have left them battered and bruised, yet, we must remain vigilant. It is time to build our own anarchy, free from the state inside and out of our territory!" Yuri found his footing, continuing to rally the people to his side as he laid out the core message of the anarchist movement. If for only a moment, the weight of the fear lifted from his shoulders."

It didn't matter now, whatever lead to the fragmentation of Russia and the rise of anarchy. The question was easier asked than answered, so Dr. Drugov simply didn't. He would be more than content to board a boat and leave this madness behind him but-\n\n"I figured I'd find you here." came Ms. Drugova from behind. She was not Dr. Drugova or Mrs. Drugova, no, she fancied herself Drugova the free, the anarchist.\n\nDr. Drugov nodded, still facing out to the sea, "You've come to join me, Natalia?"\n\n"Like Hell."\n\nDr.Drugov chuckled, "I figured as such." The pair stood in silence for some time, a daughter watching her father's back. A whistle blew in the distance, breaking the silence. "I should be going."\n\n"You should."\n\n"Why did you come, Natalia? To mock me? To see me off?" Dr. Drugov whipped around in rage, facing his daughter. She was not smirking or attempting to hide a laugh. Instead, tears ran down the young woman's face. Dr. Drugov stepped to console his daughter but she recoiled back, stepping away from him. Her father opened his mouth to say something, anything he could, but was cut off by yet another blast of the whistle. He looked to his daughter and back to the sea."

So here we are!" He threw his arms in the air.\n\nYuri knocked on the door to the decrepit shack three times and placed his hand on his hip. He waited, his clique crowding the rickety wooden porch.

Ivan gestured to the still-growing crowd gathering around the two men and the kneeling officer before them.\n\n"Oh don't bullshit me with this again, Ivan! I've had to put up with your bitching for the last three months about this issue and I have made my point clear! This man is a traitor! Not eve a traitor, he was never on our side to begin with!" Mikhail wildly waved the firearm around as he spoke.\n\n"You can't shoot all your problems away Mikhail! That's exactly what Stepanov wanted for us!" Ivan pleaded.\n\nMikhail switched his target, pointing the gun at his friend. "Do not compare me to that man, I have nothing in common with him!" He shouted.\n\nIvan's eyes widened, "Jesus Christ, what the fuck is wrong with you? You are going to have me shot for what?

"I am not doing this to spite you, Yevgeniya. This is a decision long in the making, not simply on a whim. I have always been weary of the General Assembly, nothing is to stop another Stepanov from arising."\n\nValenteev hastened his pace and stopped in front of Yuri, grabbing him by the shoulders, "Companion Galanskov, I can't let you do this. I understand where you are coming from but I can assure you that devolving power further down is not going go to make anyone's life easier. The General Assembly is fine as it is."\n\nYuri shrugged Valenteev's hands off of him and began to formulate a retort but Yevgeniya raced next to Valenteev and put her hands on his chest. "Yuri! Please, I know you are just trying to do what you think is right, but consider the implications before you act! This will make assisting those who need it most even harder!"\n\nYuri took a step back, letting his friend's hands fall down to her sides. He furrowed his brow and stared at the pair before him.

Certainly, no people had suffered more than those who traversed life hand and hand with God.\n\nEven if God was enraged or mournful, whatever, His frozen tears did little to help. This storm was terrible. The whole house could be burried. Best not to think about it. Sergey shut the blinds and turned around. Another storm was brewing, one inside his own home. Sergey's wife cradled his youngest son, while his oldest fiddled with the radio, his second son sitting adjacent. They had called out for relief hours ago, but no single came. Sergey added another log to the fire, just to distract himself.\n\nSergey's oldest son threw the headphones off his head, "Nobody is listening! There's no point in this."

Hiding his true intentions deep inside our most treasured institution!" Yuri retracted his hands and put them against his chest for emphasis, "I was fooled. WE were fooled. I figured him a friend." Yuri paused, watching the reactions of the masses gathered in the General Assembly. "Despite what we may have thought about General Stepanov, the fact is that he had too much power in his position, something we failed to recognize until it was far too late." Yuri made eye contact with all his companions, his next words would shape the future of the Territory. "We cannot risk this ever happening again." Yuri straightened out the papers on the desk, all evidence used against Stepanov. "I recommend the total obliteration of the Black Army in it's current form."\n\nYuri looked out into the silent jury, the people exchanged glances. What was he saying, the people said through their eyes. I don't know, others responded with a shake of the head, but it doesn't sound good. Companion Galanskov tapped on the table as he waited. He scoffed to himself, usually he could never quiet them down, now when he needs them to speak they won't?\n\nFinally, a young man rose from his seat, adjusted his hat, and spoke in a shaky voice, "You're not calling for the death of the men and women who have volunteered to protect us, are you, Companion Galanskov?"\n\n.Yuri stared deep into the eyes of the boy and answered without blinking, "I have always called for the death of the state, Companion." The quiet General Assembly erupted into chaos, as it always did. Yuri beat his hand on the table, calling the hall to order. "What should we do then, let them build power? Wait for them to take control of this territory?" The room, though divided into many camps, seemed to agree on one proposal; allowing the Black Army to redeem itself through labour. Yuri considered the people's decision, but also thought of his concern, how many more Stepanovs hid in the Black Army? He took a deep breath and responded, giving his verdict."

She wanted to see the ocean so terribly bad. It was something Pyotr mentioned time and time again, the way the waves struggled against the frozen layer above it. Pyotr, the foolish boy, his grin stretching from ear to ear, was so proud to proclaim that it was a perfect analogy for the anarchist struggle.\n\nStepanov never visited the far east, a matter of fact, he dreaded it. He mentioned it to Irinushka many times while she escorted him from commune to commune. He didn't come to Siberia on his own will, but found Tomsk to be quite enjoyable and often made off-handed comments about how the thought about having to invade the far east made him nauseous. What he never mentioned was a coup. Something Irinushka reiterated to the assembly more times than she could count. They didn't care. They had the nerve to look her in the face and tell her it was for her own good.\n\nThe vehicle stopped abruptly, smacking Irinushka's head against the steel. She winced in pain but did not yelp. She had not said a word since they took Pyotr. If this was the people's will, so be it. She wasn't a people then, she supposed. The door before her slid open. Two men, stood there, many more behind them with guns. They said something about Magadan, about liberation, about work. Irinushka simply smiled, just behind one of the men she could see the ocean."

How many times did he go back to his home after exterminating his enemies, wash the blood from his hands, and make passionate love to his wife? The number, if it even existed, was unknown to Shura. His career was to kill and to act like he'd never see the end of a rifle himself.\n\nHe could try and say something witty, maybe exercise a quip or two he had been saving. He could try and say something depressing, maybe get the executioner to flinch, that was a victory right? In truth, his experience taught him that last words, no matter how meaningful or impactful, meant nothing to the bullet torpedoing towards him. He remained silent as the solider before him cocked the gun. He pointed it at the head of the kneeling man before him and fired.\n\nShura embraced the bang of the rifle, but something was wrong. The executioner must have lost his balance while aiming. The bullet lodged itself neatly in his chest. Against his best judgement and his own personal will, he screamed. He let out a visceral scream from somewhere deep inside him, previously hidden. Maybe it was the scream of all those he had killed before, bottled up inside him and now set free.

It was time that it be abolished, for good. No longer would the Black Army be at the beck and call of officials that could not be held accountable for their actions. Before they could stage some kind of "coup" against Galanskov and get themselves killed. Nobody would object. It was obvious that their time in the spotlight had come to an end.

Yuri could feel a smile forming, it was so rare just to see anarchy in action. To see people go about their days as they wanted to, no restrictions or commands from a central authority. Yevgeniya had to ruin it. She called the people around them, asking for their attention. A small crowd, mostly just people curious of the commotion began to grow around him. Yuri bit his lip to keep his smile in place, duty calls, he supposed, this was only the first commune of many he'd visit.

Why not fund evenly, even in smaller towns? Focusing the limited funds they had on larger cities would only widen a diminished rural-urban gap, when distributing it to smaller towns could give them a much needed boost.

So when presented with a full list of the funding and resources needed, multiple representatives jeered on and yelled for the timid scientist to get off stage.\n\nA vote must be held in the end, though. Two motions had been proposed: provide the scientists with all the resources they needed, and hopefully see a bomb done better and quicker, or give them partial funding and resources. This would still likely see a bomb, but researchers are obviously not happy about not giving free rein for what is a priority in Siberia."

If they were busy (though few were busy enough to miss an assembly), they brought their deputies in their place. There was electricity in the congress hall that seemed to seize every man and woman: they were a part of something, something real. Even if it was just some assembly in Siberia, their job, their life, was for the betterment of all men.\n\nThe excited murmur in the hall dimmed to a whisper as Yuri took the stage. Pulling the old microphone closer to his lips and straightening his posture, he began to speak to the hundreds gathered. Yuri was never an orator - his voice was uncertain, and his cadence stilted - but all of them huddled in the hall understood him, and that was what mattered.\n\n"I was in my bedroom last night, lying awake, and wondering to myself: how does anarchy survive? Truly survive? It is not merely by spirit alone. If that was true, then what of the countless oppressed who yearn for the spirit of anarchy? What of the theoreticians and philosophers, who wrote book upon book on the ideal? It seems to be clear that men must die for anarchy. For freedom. Whether it is statists and fascists, or anarchists themselves, it seems that we must kill the vanguards of a state to achieve lasting anarchy. And I was considering this unfortunate conclusion when I realized it was not from the loins of death that anarchy emerges, but from the fear of death. When the statists fear catastrophe, they will leave us to our own devices. When the statists fear the ultimate destruction - nuclear hellfire - they will leave us to our freedom. And so it is the ultimate weapon that will lead us to the ultimate ideal, men.""

Yuri finally went off the deep end or maybe he jumped in the water long ago and finally pulled down the rest of us to his level. Yuri played fair though, he couldn't rag on Yuri too hard when Yuri had dragged himself out of his house to attend the meeting, whether out of curiosity or for entertainment.\n\nYuri took his seat near the back of the tightly packed room. Producing a decaying cigarette from his jacket pocket, Yuri let the paper hang carelessly from his mouth as he patted himself down in search of his lighter. An older woman climbed on stage, assisted by some Black Army hotshot. She hobbled up to the microphone, "Test. Test. Are we good?" The people recoiled from the feedback. "Good!" She said cheerily. "I want to extend my gratitude for those who came out tonight, this project is of the upmost importance. That being said, I won't take too much of your time, I know there's a storm coming in. So, if there's someone who'd like to sta-"\n\n"Yeah I've got something to say." Yuri grinned, looking up at the man who rose to speak. This'll be good. "Have we considered how entrenched privilege is in war? The construction of atomic weapons is the highest form of classism!" Yuri couldn't restrain himself from laughing hysterically, drawing angry looks from the room.\n\n"Is there something you find funny about your Companion's comment?" The elderly woman called from the stage.\n\n"No no, I just-" Yuri continued to laugh, "He said that nuclear war was classist! I'm as much of an anarchist as the next guy, but come on, this is just ridiculous!"\n\n"What's ridiculous is that you dragged yourself out of your house looking as you do and still have the gall to insult your fellow companions."

Yuri called out as the older man who invited him out went for the kettle.\n\n"I figured you'd want to warm up, most people aren't prepared for the cold." He said, pouring water into the kettle, "Plus, with the topic I wish to discuss, I want to make sure you're firing on all cylinders.

"A college friend of mine...what was his name? I couldn't remember for the life of me. He studied agriculture, it was his big thing and he mentioned it to me one time.

People gave Siberia a bad reputation as a barren wasteland but there were so many hidden treasures to be found. Yuri retrieved a pen and paper from the briefcase and began to sketch a scene of the car he was in. He wasn't good at art but was getting better.\n\n"Can I offer you some drinks, Companion?"

A larger farm to the south of the hamlet was saving food for any Black Army patrols that passed through the town, but after realizing how dire the situation was decided to set aside most of it for the family.\n\nThe exact deal was hashed out, handshakes were made, and everybody got plenty drunk. After all, the night was cold and the vodka was warm. It began to feel like a party. Someone even brought a balalaika, and just as everybody began to dance, a shot rang out. Not a mile out, some hunter far from the forest, but in the barn. A man held the gun above his head, and as everyone figured out who exactly shot it, they finally realized who that new citizen was. Not a citizen - not even a local. By the accent he drunkenly spoke in, he was from Novosibirsk. To frightened ears, he was able to slur out a few words.\n\n"No-one will be, ah - sharing food - without express permission from the Black Army. That is the end of it, you rural slops."\n\nHe grabbed the bottle of Vodka and left the barn, departing on a horse. The rest of the citizens stood in shock. A family would be going hungry this winter."

Each one in mottled black uniforms with a rusty pistol and a few rounds of ammunition. They said it was for bears, but everyone of them knew that a nine millimeter couldn't take out a bear. It was designed for a man. They came bearing a slip of paper, printed in a shaky black script that practically smelled like the despair of Novosibirsk. That was, if it hadn't been rolled into a cigarette yet. Each one had memorized the message by heart.\n\n"Bring your leaders to Novosibirsk. There, Marshall Stepanov and you will decide the fate of the free territories."\n\nAnd so they came in droves, as diverse as the means they employed to get themselves there. Some short, tall, white, indigenous. It was quite possibly the largest Congress in the free territory's history. An old convention center was poorly cleaned; a long table was stacked high with fresh buns. The members took their seats, the doors closed and reporters kept their ears on the doors, trying in vain to hear something coherent. No one was allowed in or out.\n\n"Was that a horse?"\n\n"Did I just hear a gunshot?"\n\n"A baby crying? In there?"\n\nBy midnight, most had given up in their search for knowledge. In the early hours of the morning, a smartly dressed convention member emerged with a paper in his right hand and a megaphone in his left and began speaking to the few left.\n\n"We have decided on the future governance of Siberia.""

The worker had gotten everything they had asked for: equal rights, worker's liberation, and the achievement of a sort of socialism. So curiosity struck Novosibirsk when a small protest did break out in Anarchy Square. This was a different kind of protest, though. Instead of arguing for further economic measures, they argued for political freedom. It was the first time they had to do so, being given total freedom before Stepanov came to power. Now, all across Siberia, theft took place and freedoms were curtailed. In the north, valuable timber was floated down the river for firewood on the front. Horses and tractors were seized; they were needed for efforts "to develop the region". The best wheat in the south was taken in the south for soldier's rations. Some outspoken communal leaders began to disappear. It seemed that all that the Black Army had been founded on was gone in a scant few months. Freedom was no longer free.\n\nThat is not to say that the Black Army was about to fire on a group of peaceful protestors. Stepanov was statist, not stupid. For now, he could watch as resistance simply faded out and the Black Army began to show the people what freedom really cost. No longer could they sit idly and fail to contribute to freeing Russia. They would have to sacrifice for victory, and Stepanov ensured that every family bore a cost. To harden them."

Stolen music, stolen wine, stolen power. The dinning hall was silent, save for the ambient muffled music of the record player. Stepanov propped his elbows on the table, resting his chin on his folded hands, "I trust you find your food to be of the highest quality?" The table nodded politely nodded.\n\nMy hours are slumberless.\n\n"Good."

Valenteev rose from his seat.\n\n"Yes, I think I should be going. Got to be to bed." Kilichakov stood, pushing in his chair.\n\nThen there were two.

Integrating the new territories, signing off on the Black Army budget, dealing with greedy communes, it seemed simple enough to the uneducated man. Put your name on the paper and hand it to the poor sap who has to inform his commune that they will not be receiving any additional reallocations. However, what set him apart from the average pencil pusher was that while some men lamented the very concept of currency, Kilichakov found solace in it. He enjoyed his job, something Stepanov was very much aware of.\n\nExiting his office out into the brisk Novosibirsk air, Kilichakov was greeted by the leader of anarchy, Ivan Stepanov. "How do you do, Mikhail?" Stepanov said with a grunt, rising from the bench he was sitting on. "Why don't you join me for a walk?"\n\n"You know, Mikhail," Stepanov said as they strolled around the block, "I don't know how numbers work. I'll be honest, I really don't." Stepanov stopped, his hands in his coat pocket. "I know you do."\n\n"Well, it comes with experience I suppose. Partially it comes naturally but-"\n\n"Do you know what else I know, Mikhail? I know money doesn't just disappear." Stepanov pulled a cigar from his pocket and lit it. "I want you on my side, but I know there are another million men here who know numbers just as well."\n\nMikhail Kilchichakov gave a slight nod, "So it's blackmail then?""

 SBA_Despotist.9.desc: ""Yes, uh-huh, I see." Stepanov, in fact, did not see. Few understood what mad ramblings came from Androniy Mishuernko. Yet, at heart, Ivan Stepanov was an actor. He at least knew how to pretend he was listening, not that he even had to. Stepanov could've been sound asleep and still Mishuernko would rant and rave about the importance of service to destroy the Nazi threat. He leaned back in his chair, watching as the aging general hung up a crudely drawn map of Europe beyond the Urals.\n\n"This," Mishuernko said, circling the heartland of Russia occupied by the Germans, "Is the ultimate goal. The reclamation of our homeland is the most essential task before our people. So long Russians have writhed in agony under the boot of Hitler, we must free them at the earliest possible opportunity."\n\n"I couldn't agree more." For maybe the first time in his life, Stepanov found himself agreeing with the mad man. Moscow must be reclaimed. Riding in on a horse, proudly waving the black banner; it would cement Stepanov's rule for years to come.\n\nMishuernko dug through his bag for yet another map, but while he was searching, he made an off-hand comment. "I find you much more workable than the boy."\n\n"You do?"\n\n"Yes. I think you have the wherewithal to do what you have to do, something the boy could never.""

Valenteev did not speak Chinese, he had never seen the country, but the border to China was largely undefended. Leaving from Magadan would be too obvious, he'd be waiting for him there and Valenteev certainly wouldn't take his chances out west. Maybe it was best not to think about that. Valenteev flipped through the different stations on the radio to distract himself.\n\n"HELP!" His radio shouted, "PLEASE GOD HELP US!" The blood curdling scream sent chills down the mans back. He slammed on the brake, gripping the wheel tight to prevent flying out from his seat. "This is Maria Federova." The radio sobbed, "I'm trapped in the Gorno-Altaysk church...please, if anyone is listening, I NEED HELP!" Valenteev wasted no time, throwing the car into drive and speeding towards the commune.\n\nThe commune was rural and small, Valenteev knew, but it was abnormally quiet. He cautiously made his way to the church, keeping low and his firearm at the ready. He could see men, dead, on the floor from the window. Fuck! He was too late. Unless the girl managed to hide while the village dealt with the bandits? Valenteev entered their church, his finger hovering over the trigger.\n\n"HELP!" The girl called out, "PLEASE GOD HELP US!" Valenteev rushed over to the origin of the sound. He threw open the cellar doors and found not a girl, but a record player, a radio, and enough explosives to demolish the Volkshalle."

 SBA_Despotist.11.desc: "Stepanov took a drag of the last cigarette in the pack. He had not yet become the hedonistic man authoritarians often became, but he graced himself with subtle luxuries. The cigarette wasn't locally produced, not out of one of those shitty tobacco farms outside of the city. This was a real American smoke, Virginia made. When he inhaled the smoke, for just a fleeting moment, he doubted that communes could never be successful. After all, if some capitalist plantations in Virginia could make this, what did that say about a few Russian nitwits toiling in a "workplace democracy?"\n\nThis thought was interrupted by the ring of his telephone (not such a luxury, an old Red Army telephone.) Picking up the telephone, Stepanov heard an unfamiliar voice, in an accent from Moscow. Probably fled after the war. He spoke with a quiver in his voice.\n\n"Sir, I speak on behalf of Marshal Valenteev. The marshal kindly requests you stand down and cooperate in the restoration of Anarchy.\n\nStepanov considered his options. Either he was to give in and perhaps lose his life in a Siberian prison, or he was to stand in defiance of Valenteev. And if he stood in defiance, who knew what lay in store? So he picked up the phone and stood in defiance.\n\nVelenteev heard the phone ring and his heart skipped. Could this be it? The moment where for once, they won? They could stop fighting and pushing and rest. Rest, for once, no more stressing about statism or despots or death in the name of life. Just rest. He picked up the phone and his heart skipped again.\n\nHe wasn't prepared for this response. He hadn't thought he would be called on his bluff. He didn't have the men, the money, to fight a war. God, how could he be so stupid? Those next words from Stepanov ripped the man's heart out, his idealism, his hope."

It had to be today or it would never happen.\n\n"Companion Stepanov, you still have not explained what happened to Companion Yuri Galanskov. He was under your protection, his disappearance has concerned a great many in this Assembly." The words snapped Stepanov back to reality, as he stared at the many faces of the Assembly, all staring back at him intently, waiting for an answer. He looked at his notes, a long speech decrying Yuri, pointing out his many failures and general lack of intelligence. Claiming his 'disappearance' was that overzealous child's own fault. But that wasn't Stepanov's style, it never had been. "Comrades." Stepanov grinned as that hated term caused a sea of disgust among those in the Assembly "I don't have to answer for the tragic fate of comrade Yuri. Because as of this moment, this Assembly is disbanded." He pressed a button hidden underneath the podium.\n\n"Companion Stepanov, what is this statist madness?" An assemblyman asked right before dozens of members of the Black Army poured into the room. A wave of relief hit Stepanov as he gripped the podium. This was a moment he had pictured for so long, part of him had never believed it would happen. And yet here it was.\n\nOne of the assemblymen rose to his feet "This is a betrayal, Stepanov! Of the Free Territory and all-" One of the soldiers dragged him back down to his seat, securing his silence with the butt of her rifle. Stepanov grabbed the microphone. "It is regretful that such drastic actions have become necessary." He lied "But the General Assembly has constantly shown itself incapable of managing the Free Territory. The Security Council will do just fine without you. Now if you'll cooperate with these soldiers as they escort you out of the room, we can help ensure this transition is peaceful and orderly.""

The chilly wind on a summer morning, the biting cold in the winter. The snow capped mountains just peeking over the horizon. Every day was rich, unchanging, blowing like the wind. He could live like this forever.\n\nThey came at night, in a big, rumbling military truck. They rolled right up to the door and in their big boots marched to it and started knocking. It never stopped knocking. He could hear it still today. Then they pushed the door down and pulled him away. He screamed. He was only a boy. He wasn't ready to die for his country. And his mother screamed. His father tried to fight back, for a few minutes, but a gun butt to the face silenced him. They had to drag him out of the house, kicking and screaming for his life. They threw him into the back of the truck. He couldn't stop crying, with the blindfold over his head. He cried and cried and cried, always hearing that knocking. Was it even there anymore?

They both knew he wouldn't make it. They headed back into the van and drove off, leaving the boy in the dust, his tears still drying. Rummaging through the bag, he found a canteen full of water, some meager rations, stale bread, and a tarp, presumably for shelter. It would have to do. What else was he to do? Wait for the vultures to take him? So he set off, kicking rocks and yelping down the trail.\n\nWhen his anger finally melted into sadness, he began to look around him. The landscape reminded him of home. There wasn't a delta, but there were those same low mountains, those hills spotted with patches of trees. It almost felt like home.\n\nHe was tired, and hungry, and he had run out of bread. By now, the moon had come out. They were right. He would never make it. He hastily tied the tarp between two trees and sat down on a log, looking at the dark landscape. He never slept, just sitting there, crying, enraged and in a horrible stupor.\n\nUntil the sky began to move. It started out with a few blazes of light, but within a few minutes it had begun to vibrate and jostle with fantastic color. Green, purple, blue, lighting up the sky.

They yelled drunken slurs at passing soldiers and threw loose bricks and rocks from the cobblestone. A crowd began to build up, of curious spectators and disgruntled soldiers. It seemed as if this was about to turn into a one-sided fight, a Boston Massacre for a new Russia. Which new Paul Revere would depict it, famously?

But it was an open secret where they were. Either lost to an eternal dreamless sleep, or toiling in camps up north. Life was brutal and often short in those camps.

The leech he was, the way money disappeared from the budget in his presence would impress Stepanov if it weren't so tedious.\n\n"Comrade Stepanov, this is Androniy Mishurenko." Stepanov could hear the spit flying out of his mouth. How on Earth did he ever end up with this man as his most trusted advisor?\n\n"Is Yevgeniya with you? She mentioned she would be stopping by your office. Something about a-"\n\n"The terrorist attack in Kansk? Yes I am familiar."\n\nStepanov was taken aback. When did Mishuernko grow a pair of balls? He resisted the urge to tear him a new asshole, business came first. "Is she down there or not?"\n\n"No. She never came by." Silence. "Comrade Stepanov, have you heard about them?"\n\nThe line pushed him over the edge, "Cut the cryptic bullshit, dear god. I thought I had the last of that with Galanskov, for fuck's sake." Silence once more. Stepanov bit his lip, he did really want to know..."Tell me what's going on, Androniy. Do I need to come to Kansk?""
