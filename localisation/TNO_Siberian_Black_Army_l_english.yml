 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_SIBERIAN_SOVIET_DESC:0 "In the wake of the Union's collapse, the people of the Angara's basin founds themselves free from the authority of Moscow. The first thing they did, in a true socialist fashion, was to assemble a committee. Many of the regional institutions were functioning without Moscow's oversight, and with some rationing and belt-tightening, many of the goods that it imported from elsewhere in the union could be forgone or replaced with local substitutes. Contact with the remnants of the Soviet government in western Russia had been lost, and they were hesitant to acknowledge the "democratic" provisional government of the Central Siberian Republic and the tyrannical regime of Genrikh Yagoda alike, forming self-defense militia squads fighting for their freedoms with blood. And thus, influenced by the influx of once ostracized anarchist thinkers from the farthest parts of the Soviet Union, they proclaimed their independence as the Siberian Anarchist Soviet, a self-governing ruling body with equal representation for all major towns and industrial unions.\n\nAs their position became secure from the foreign threats, the Siberian Black Army, the military force of the free communes of the shores of Iya, became one the leading voices in the Soviet and declared the militarized anarchism as its main platform. The militia service became an essential part of every man and woman of the Free Territory, and the armed formations of free communes are assembled not merely as a means of self-defense for the free communities, but also as a means of spreading the liberating ideology abroad.\n\nThe spreading militarization of the anarchist society, seemingly contradictory to anarchist ideals, caused surprisingly little tensions between the Army and the Soviet, but many of commoners fear that the ambitions of the Black Army, the protector of the independence of Siberian communes, will eventually become the undoing of their own freedoms."
 
 POLITICS_KHAKASSIA_SECURITY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "Seen as the shock to jump start the still heart of mother anarchy, the ascension of the Security Council as the deciding force in Siberian politics came as a shock to many, and yet so few. While international observers ponder the implications of a sidelined General Assembly, those under the empowered Black Army have a more difficult conundrum ahead of them, the question if they can still call themselves free.\n\nComprised of the most influential and talented officers Central Siberia has to offer, the Free Territory has altered its course away from the initial goal. What once was a united struggle between those who had seen pain, who had lived under the boot of tyranny their whole lives, against the oppressive system that has haunted mankind since time eternal, has been molded, changed, deformed by the scheming of General Ivan Stepanov.\n\nStepanov's rise to prominence came during the collapse of the Central Siberian Republic. As commander of a division tasked with leading the charge into the heart of Yagoda's state, the General saw the futility of marching more Russians to kill more Russians at the behest of suits in a capitol. In an impromptu deal with powerful orator and union leader Yuri Galanskov, Stepanov railed his division against tyranny, against authority, while Galanskov secured the movement's popular support.\n\nIt has been a long climb to the top for Ivan Stepanov, but with the General Assembly rendered powerless, all that's left for the general is to do what he has always done, put on a good show."

 KHA_intro_mother_anarchys_eldest_sons_desc:0 "The Siberian Black Army, formed in the fallout of the collapse of Yagoda's empire a few years ago, has become the torch-bearer of anarchist ideology. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world across the frontier, we thrive in our own lands. The Free Territory we have created was formed on the foundations of militarized anarchism, laid by the Black Army's first supporters. However, for us to spread the message of our ideology and liberate our neighbors, there is a long road ahead, one crowded with hurdles but an opportunity for success as well.\n\nOur communes must be improved, without stripping them of their rights in the stateless society. The Black Army, the core unit responsible for their defense, must also be improved, lest we be defenseless when the Free Territory is in danger. If everything goes as planned, then we will soon be ready to face the future."
 KHA_intro_assemble_the_communal_representatives_desc:0 "The General Assembly of the Siberian Black Army was one of the organs created in our first years of existence, aiming to coordinate policy between each and every anarchist commune we liberate. Being regularly convened, it often deals with everyday matters, yet matters that are still important to the flawless function of the Free Territory.\n\nAs time goes on, we continue to survive in this chaotic and unstable environment, and that has a lot to do with the fact that we maintain our ideals of anarchy without letting our guard down. For this to continue, we must also pursue internal cooperation, and the General Assembly provides us with an excellent way to do that, by discussing the affairs of our lands openly and transparently."
 KHA_intro_assemble_the_security_council_desc:0 "Even though the Siberian Black Army is the greatest advocate of true liberty for the Russian people, it would be a lie to claim that, in the current situation we find ourselves in, organized protection by a fighting force is not needed. Thus, we have adopted the system of militarized anarchism our people have come to adore. Crucial to this system is the Security Council, composed of the leading commanders of every organized militia force loyal to the Black Army. Of course, these commanders are all elected by the soldiers themselves, and this way we can be sure they represent their voices and their interests. Another session of the Security Council will surely help us bring up and deal with all recent matters of security."
 KHA_intro_the_third_congress_of_tulun_desc:0 "The town of Kansk lies in Siberia, on the linchpin connecting the Far East with the rest of the nation, and has become the greatest example of the success of our anarchist experiment. In the buildings where Yagoda's puppets used to govern from, the tradition of the Congress of Kansk has developed. There, every few years, representatives from across the lands of the Black Army convene.\n\nThe issues to be discussed are plenty, and are often important to the foundations of the Free Territory themselves. The delegates shall present the state the Black Army finds itself in, and the progress which has been made in establishing the lawless society in Central Siberia. With this, we can reflect on what we have achieved since the day of our foundation."
 KHA_intro_present_elected_officer_candidates_desc:0 "Another proud tradition of the Siberian Black Army, following the beliefs of the original Makhnovshchyna and all true anarchists, is the democratic election of all officers. Instead of blindly abiding by the traditional, autocratic command structures, every commander of the Army, made by the people to protect the people, is elected democratically. The Soldiers' Assemblies are the ones responsible for carrying out that process, and furthermore, any officer can be recalled at any point. over the years of our existence we have succeeded in perfecting this process, to the point where competent men rise to the top through the choice of the troops.\n\nAs the Third Congress of Kansk progresses, we must show the state of the military and those at its helm. Thus, those elected by the Soldiers' Assemblies shall make their appearance in the Congress, to be presented to the communal delegates and discuss other matters."
 KHA_intro_present_revolutionary_security_reports_desc:0 "The army of the Free Territory provides the backbone of protecting our liberated lands, as if it wasn't for them, we would have never broken the chains and we would still be under the rule of the totalitarian empire of Yagoda, or the "democratic" state of Central Siberia. However, ensuring that all units' function and their actions are synchronized and harmonized with the rest is an incredibly difficult task. For that reason, "security reports" that outline the local situation across our territories and help coordinate efforts to relieve communes from dangers and defend them. With the Third Congress of Kansk taking place, security reports can be important to show the big picture in Central Siberia and how it affects the anarchist communes. Unity in dealing with the threats we face is massively important in the chaos of Russian warlordism."
 KHA_intro_present_local_developmental_reports_desc:0 "To show the success of our experiment to the great number of communal delegates in the Congress of Kansk, the results of projects and the self-governance in all settlements must be shown. It is indisputable that, to one degree or the other, every village and town has received help, not from a state authority, but merely through the principles of anarchy, that allow the locals to freely develop their home. We need to highlight this, by getting experts to present their findings and reports on the developing communities in the Congress. This way, we shall also convince the more stubborn delegates of the effectiveness of our system."
 KHA_intro_riding_on_desc:0 "The Siberian Black Army, created amidst a sea of chaos and authoritarianism, must remain an island of stability and true liberty. Our neighboring warlords have become textbook examples of what we wish not to become, and so we strive to stay away from them, instead pursuing our anarchist dream. Solely through the will and the determination of our people, we slowly begin to overcome the problems that have plagued us for so long, and develop Central Siberia for the good of the cause. And since we are heading into conflict with other warlords, we must do everything we can to ensure that the Black Army will come out of it as the victor."

 KHA_second_revolutionary_reconstruction_desc:0 "The Siberian Soviet has survived what many thought would be the end of a short lived anarchist experiment. Tens of thousands of lives later, we have achieved independence from the tyrannical Yagoda. Unfortunately, our glorious revolution is not yet secure. Our army was utterly drained by the last war, and our industry is in no condition to produce guns at the rates needed to replenish our equipment stockpiles, whatever industry is left, that is. We remain undeterred however, plans are already being drawn up for the liberation of Siberia, and our soldiers are eager to spread revolutionary anarchism to all of Russia. No gods nor masters, only man!"
 KHA_second_the_red_mantle_desc:0 "The Siberian Plan was a massive industrial program that built up regions of Russia far from the front line with Germany industrially in preparation of the German-Soviet War. We ultimately lost the war, but the industry built during that time allowed the Soviet Union to push far beyond what anybody ever expected. Ironically, the territory of the Siberian Soviet was never a particular focus of the plan, and thus our industrial capacity is lower than that of our neighbors. Nonetheless, the industry available to us will provide a solid base upon which we can expand."
 KHA_second_the_peoples_survey_desc:0 "In order to properly allocate resources in the communal economy, it is important that we know what territories are suitable for industrial development, for resource extraction, and for agrarian development. Additionally, borders between warlords are often uncertain and flexible. A land survey would allow us to plot out exactly what territory is ours, and what territory would be valuable or strategic to defend in the event of war. To this end, local communities will be asked to participate in a "People's Survey", in which the communes will voluntarily survey their lands in coordination with their neighboring communes."
 KHA_second_industrial_data_consolidation_desc:0 "As a result of our rather unique decentralized form of government, the quality and amount of industrial machines available to each commune is often dictated by what the communes themselves can produce. This has led to a great disparity in industrial strength between the communes, and some communities have been unable to produce according to their needs. Having compiled the industrial data provided to us by our various communes, we have identified several communities that would benefit the most from an investment into their productive capabilities."
 KHA_second_begin_the_redistribution_desc:0 "The land reform efforts we began years ago when we first established the Siberian Soviet were never completed. The focus of simply surviving the Siberian War consumed most of our time and efforts. With those issues resolved, we can resume our efforts redistributing the land according to each community's needs. Our failure to resolve the issue has led to some communes abusing their size and manpower to push other communes out of land they need. This land reform program will seek to reorganize communal borders in a more fair and equitable way."
 KHA_second_repair_the_transsib_desc:0 "Among the few successes of the old Tsarist regime was the creation of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. The railroad had an inordinate impact on Russia, binding the nation in a way never seen before. Used extensively during the Bukharin regime, after WW2 it became a vital artery for the Soviet Union in the Soviet-German war of the 1950s. After we lost the war, German bombers pummeled the rail line into near oblivion. However, with German bombers now far away from Russian skies, we can repair the portion of the railway that runs within our borders, and maybe bring back some of its former luster."
 KHA_second_continue_regional_interconnection_desc:0 "Furthering the development of our infrastructure is always a goal to strive towards. Not only does it improve the flow of resources throughout the country, but it also brings the communes closer together, both economically and politically. These bonds between them will be tested as we expand the reach of Siberian Soviet, so anything we can do to strengthen them will be vital. To that end, we will be investing into the creation of a road system that will travel all across the SIberian Soviet, and connect us with even the most isolated communes."
 KHA_second_return_to_the_mines_desc:0 "With normal economic functions restored, and a good deal of stimulus having been added in the form of public reconstruction projects, the economy has begun to grow at a rapid pace. Demand for mineral resources has increased nearly tenfold, and many of the communes are ill equipped to provide. With the threat of German bombers destroying any large scale mining operations gone, this seems like a good time to reopen mines that were previously closed. Additionally, we should begin manufacturing and distributing new mining equipment to the communes with mine sites readily available."
 KHA_second_dedicated_agricultural_production_desc:0 "Our communes are growing larger by the day. The nutritional and economic security that our communes provide for the everyday family has had an pronounced effect on birth rates. WIth this in mind, it is becoming ever more pertinent that we boost agricultural output. Consequently, mechanized farming equipment should be produced and distributed to the communes, so that they might increase production. Not only will this help our farmers produce more, but it will also free time for our workers to do other tasks."
 KHA_second_rural_production_nodes_desc:0 "The heart of anarchist society lies not in the cities or suburbs, but in the countrysides rural towns and local communities therein. Helping these communities to end their reliance on cities for manufactured goods is an important goal for us. Therefore, we will encourage the development of local workshops so that the communes might produce manufactured goods for themselves. Additionally, these workshops will allow the communes to arm themselves more easily with the production of Kalashnikovs being right in their backyard."
 KHA_second_the_foundation_laid_desc:0 "An experiment in anarchism that many thought was not possible, we have proven time and time again that ours is the superior ideology. Without compromising our morals, we have managed to create an economic system that benefits all, and not just a privileged few who happen to control the means of production. We've completed laying the economic foundation of a nation of and for all Russia peoples."
 KHA_second_the_grey_area_desc:0 "In a perfect world, the anarchist society would come about naturally, as the popular reaction to the corrupt and unjust states that ruled over them, states that favoured the wealthy and affluent above all else. As things stand, however, it would seem that the people are more attached to their states than originally anticipated, and many of those states take issue with our existence. The communes separately cannot repel an invasion from these powers, and thus a centralized military is necessary if we are to survive. But is such an apparatus not contradictory to the fundamentals of anarchism? Furthermore, the central council that presides over all the communes, regardless of how democratic it is, not also opposed to the ideals of anarchism? How far can we stray from our roots before betraying our ideological core? We should encourage these discussions and plot out exactly what rights should be allowed to the communes and individuals as opposed to the central government."
 KHA_second_delegate_industrial_administration_desc:0 "At its core, communism is an ideology whose whole purpose is to give the means of production back to the people. Giving a centralized government control of the economy is completely contradictory to this idea. In order to improve the efficiency of our economy, we should instead create an industrial council from several communes, which will create a list of possible industrial improvements and sites of investment, which will then be passed on to each commune's local council for consideration. The industrial council will then also be allocated a set amount of capital so that they might facilitate such industrial construction projects in underprivileged communes."
 KHA_second_the_industrial_security_council_desc:0 "The difficult task of increasing our industrial efficiency is something that can only be accomplished through a centralized bureaucracy. The communes individually are not equipped to embark on an industrial expansion the way that the military bureaucracy might. We should use the military powers granted to us to create an organization capable of continuously collecting and analyzing this industrial information and compiling it into a list of possible improvements and expansions, which this new bureaucracy will be able to mandate to each of the communes. "
 KHA_second_roads_for_grain_desc:0 "Building roads between our communes will become increasingly important if we are to ensure prosperity and commerce between the communes. To that end, we will create a grain bank which will distribute extra grain to communes that build roads within and around the territory they control. This grain bank will be stocked voluntarily with grain provided by communes that have a surplus. In return, they will be compensated monetarily or with any raw materials or machinery with equal value to what they have provided."
 KHA_second_collective_defense_requirements_desc:0 "It is a national security imperative that our infrastructure be improved. If we are suddenly attacked on a front on which we have few or no troops, or somehow foolishly end up in a two front war, it is necessary that we be able to move our troops to wherever they need to be quickly and efficiently. In order to address the problem, the military should implement a mandatory collective defense tax, the revenue of which will be used to pay for an expansion of our infrastructure. It may elicit some consternation from the communes, but such a tax is for the best."
 KHA_second_incentivize_qualified_personnel_desc:0 "The Siberian Soviet has had an increasingly difficult time acquiring qualified personnel in important fields like mechanical and electrical engineering. This has been largely due to the absence of organized education across Russia post collapse. The best way to go about alleviating the situation is to incentivize people to go into these professions. By creating a mentor program for the men and women going into these fields, a student will be able to learn the craft under a trained professional and get paid by the government while doing it."
 KHA_second_black_army_engineer_brigades_desc:0 "These shortages of qualified personnel are directly harming our capacity to defend ourselves. Using the Black Army training infrastructure we have now, we should conscript those eligible for such specialist jobs and educate in the areas pertaining to the jobs they will have. Once they have served a short time in the army, they will be sent back to their home communes, where their skills can be put to good use helping the community and developing the economy. It's a program that benefits everyone!"
 KHA_second_assist_village_schools_desc:0 "Education is the foremost way in which we can bring our communes out of their ancient ways of thinking and into the 20th century. We should give the communes more resources for the development of their educational services, which they can use to build better schools and higher education centers. As a part of this program, we will provide higher quality teachers from the cities to assist in training new teachers over the course of the next few years. Additionally, we should endeavor to increase enrollment in schools and colleges so that our people might take advantage of these new resources available to them."
 KHA_second_expand_the_umbrella_desc:0 "Schools and the education curriculum are a vital part of our national security. Allowing the people to fall prey to reactionary and counterrevolutionary ideologies is completely unacceptable. We should bring education under our military administration so that we can assure that such reactionary thought doesn't invade the thoughts of our people. Not to mention, a centralized educational system could provide its own benefits in terms of efficiency and coordination between schools and universities."
 KHA_second_the_contradictions_settled_desc:0 "Just as the Soviet Union before us, we have arrived at some final conclusions as to how far the central government's power extends, and what rights are reserved for the people and communes. The contradictions inherent to our anarchist state have finally been solved, and with it a number of logistical and administrative issues that had previously plagued the general government. Whatever path that's been chosen, it is important to remember that all we've done, we've done in service of the greater good and the Russian people. May history look back upon us kindly."
 KHA_second_the_black_army_desc:0 "The Black Army stands as the guardians of the revolution and freedom here, and will be instrumental in liberating Siberia from the grasp of tyrants and dictators. The Siberian War took a heavy toll on our armed forces, and in many ways, we still reeling from the effects of that war on our military. Even in terms of just equipment and manpower, two areas in which we have normally done well compared to our neighbors, we have a significant ways to recover. We should take stock of the army's current situation and take note of what areas we have to improve in."
 KHA_second_review_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "As a result of our rather unique military democracy hybrid government, officers in the army are actually elected by the people as opposed to appointed by some faceless high command. While these officer elections have served to democratize the military, which has acted as a form of centralized government over the past few years, it has also opened the door to completely inept halfwits coming into positions of power. Despite this, the military reserves the right to remove such elected officers from positions of power should they prove incapable of carrying out the duties assigned to them. We should begin testing the officers currently in power to make sure that such incompetent officers aren't running our brigades."
 KHA_second_learning_from_experience_desc:0 "The Siberian Black Army has available to it some of the finest generals in all of Russia. From the Russian Civil War all the way to the recent Siberian War, our generals have experienced it all. We should endeavor to utilise the collective experience of these generals to create a new officer training curriculum. Additionally, we should coordinate with our more seasoned generals to create uniform military doctrine in which the younger officers can be educated."
 KHA_second_specialized_unit_roles_desc:0 "Over time, it has become ever clearer to Black Army military high command that in order to defend the nations, our forces will need to further specialize so as to keep pace with the other militaries of Russia. These individualized roles will become ever more important as we transition into a truly modern military force, complete with armoured division and aerial support. Consequently, we will increase funding for specialized sections of the military. Such specialized roles include heavy ordinance, engineering, reconnaissance, and infiltration."
 KHA_second_black_guards_divisions_desc:0 "Among the finest warriors of the Russian Civil War were our Tachankas, brave soldiers who charged into battle with on horse drawn wagons with machine guns. We should create a unit of similar strength and prowess. A newly created Black Guard will fill this role. Accepting only the best the Black Army has to offer, this elite organization will institute testing of members of the armed forces to gauge who and who would not be eligible to join this new group. These heavily armoured units will eventually be able to rapidly deploy around the country and set up defensive and/or offensive positions wherever needed."
 KHA_second_enhanced_equipment_channels_desc:0 "Our current system of coordinating military supply chains both to and from the factories that manufacture our arms is not only inefficient, but also potentially a major hindrance to further growth and expansion, should such things become necessary. With this in mind, many bureaucrats working in the current system have proposed a number of reforms that could hopefully reduce the severity of the problems plaguing our supply chain. Such problems include high breakage rates, failure to track and control inventory, bottlenecks, and many more. Fundamentally, all of these problems are caused by inadequate communication. By installing phone lines between every factory and supply depot, we will be able to achieve a far greater level of communication than we've ever had before, hopefully improving our industrial situation."
 KHA_second_the_new_tachanka_desc:0 "Our armored divisions have been left very far behind technologically in the race to reunite Russia. In order to rectify this situation, we have been reverse engineering captured German, Japanese, and American tanks leftover from the Siberian War and other previous conflicts. The technological insights gained from these designs, as well as a large array of data based on the performances of the T-34 and T-44 tanks in previous wars, has allowed us to create an entirely new and original vehicle design."
 KHA_second_expand_on_the_design_desc:0 "Developments in technology and our design infrastructure have finally allowed us to make headway into our new MBT design. This new tank will incorporate various new technologies, such as electric starters, two plane gun stabilization, basic night vision equipment, ammunition load of 45, and 4-stroke one-chamber water-cooled diesel engine. This design still lags behind modern tanks in a variety of ways, and some of these new technologies in the design are less than reliable. Nonetheless, this tank represents a quantum leap forward in Russian armor technology, and will lay the foundation of our modern armored military. "
 KHA_second_coverage_from_above_desc:0 "With the efforts of several dozen scientists from across the communes, we have been able to scrape together the wrecks of several downed german bombers, as well as a few indigenously designed fighters from our neighbors, which we have been reverse engineering. With help from these the parts these aircraft have provided, we have developed a number of new designs for aircraft that will put us on par with our neighbors, and allow us to forgo propellers of the past and begin making headway into the jet engines of the future."
 KHA_second_our_blade_honed_desc:0 "Following the Siberian War, our army had lain in tatters. Strained by years of brutal Siberian warfare, with little to no supply, and practically no industry, many had expected our small anarchist experiment to be consigned to the dustbin of history. They were wrong. Years later, our armies stand recovered and rejuvenated, with a strong industry and willing population behind them. We have honed the blade and tempered it with fire. It now falls upon the Black Army to strike. The only defense to their attack, is the attack to their peace."

 KHA_expansion_a_black_spring_desc:0 "All around us, the rains of April have stopped coming down. Trees are in full leaf, fledglings are learning to fly, and the Rasputitsa is coming to an end. With it are going the muddy roads that swallow entire military brigades and that destroys more Russian trucks and tanks than any military ever has. With summer right around the corner and the spring mud drying up, we are entering into a short period of time between now and autumn when the roads are clear and the weather is fair. We should take advantage of the time we have and begin preparing for war, as those around us certainly are." 
 KHA_expansion_the_final_preparations_desc:0 "Final checks are underway to ensure that the army is ready for the conflict to come. The soldiers are training, maintenance on trucks and tanks is underway, war plans are being reviewed, and our stockpile of arms is being built up. Our people are armed and ready to spread the anarchist dream to all of Russia. It won't be long before we are ready to embark upon the great unification of a truly Soviet Union, ruled by the people, not dictatorships like those of Bukharin or Yagoda."
 KHA_expansion_freedom_for_krasnoyarsk_desc:0 "The workers of Krasnoyarsk have been oppressed under the boot of an autocratic state for too long. We must free the workers of Krasnoyarsk from their oppressive false democracy. Nikolai Andreev and his military apparatus has continued their stranglehold over Krasnoyarsk for too long, and, unlike us, whose military has worked towards the democratization and liberation of Russia, theirs has done nothing but restrict workers rights and strengthen government power. We march on Krasnoyarsk at dawn."
 KHA_expansion_a_measured_integration_desc:0 "Though many of the autocrats and statists that previously ruled Krasnoyarsk are arguably irredeemable and will be put on death row, many more of these government officials were part of the proletariat like us, and solely wished to see the government do well by those it was tasked with ruling. We should reach out to these individuals and pardon them for having participated in the oppressive 'democracy' of Krasnoyarsk. Hopefully, such mercy will aid us in integrating this new territory, and ease the process of shifting into a communal society."
 KHA_expansion_cooperation_with_the_workers_desc:0 "Despite being nothing more than a false revolutionary who actively worked against the true workers revolution, Andreev was still wary of what the workers would do if they decided he was unfit to rule. In order to keep the workers satisfied, Andreev created various workers organizations both to keep the workers in check, which would allow token increases in wage or rations every now and again. We should reach out to these workers organizations, and see if they would be interested in assisting our efforts to create true workers paradise."
 KHA_expansion_justice_for_their_crimes_desc:0 "The crimes of this government cannot be excused, nor will they. Among the crimes committed include mass killings, anti-revolutionary activity, and large scale abuses against the proletariat. We shall endeavor to find every person within Krasnoyarsk who even so much as organized the filing cabinets of the previous government and put them on trial. Trial by firing squad, that is. Already the biggest culprits are lining up at the gallows, and hundreds more are on the way."
 KHA_expansion_a_peoples_war_desc:0 "The anarchic dream cannot come to fruition while subversives continue agitating within the country. We should encourage the people to root out those who are known within the community to have anti-revolutionary sentiments and eliminate them by any means necessary. Simultaneously, we can promote our ideal of armed anarchism by providing arms to the people, to aid them in this 'war' against the fascists and capitalists in the country who would hope to destroy what we have created. Bring out the vigilantes!"
 KHA_expansion_krasnoyarsk_pacified_desc:0 "After a short but relatively tumultuous occupation, it seems that Krasnoyarsk is fully ready for integration into the Siberian Soviet. The subversives here have been tried and executed, either by our military or by the good workers of Krasnoyarsk, workers organizations have been contacted and have helped us gain the trust of the people while simultaneously helping us to set up local communes, and the gears of industry and communal economy have started to turn, producing much needed weaponry for the liberation of Siberia. The anarchist revolution spreads further!"
 KHA_expansion_in_the_court_of_the_mad_king_desc:0 "That madman Rurik in Kemerovo has truly lost all his marbles. Reports have come from across the border about a "Red Monarchy" intent on helping the people through the power of a king. King Rurik II, as he now prefers to be known, has set up an entirely new dynasty in the region, with a royal court and his two children currently vying for control over the throne. Clearly the people of Kemerovo are in dire need of assistance to escape from whatever it is that Rurik has created. Russia really has fallen to insanity, hasn't it?"
 KHA_expansion_integrate_the_workers_councils_desc:0 "With Kemerovo fully under our control now, we can begin to dismantle the former government that was in place here and begin to raise communes in their stead. The first step of this process will obviously be putting that lunatic Rurik on trial for his crimes against the people of Kemerovo. Once his trial is concluded and he is thrown behind bars for life for trying to revive the monarchy in Russia, hopefully we will all be able to begin the real work of extending our military administration here and integrating these new communes into our economy."
 KHA_expansion_justice_for_huliaipole_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Siberia became what most would call anarchy. Opportunistic generals, idealistic democrats, and kings alike carved out their own states. Without regulation, the situation in Siberia slipped out of the hands of any one man or body and most used this time as an opportunity to iron out any grudges. We have our own quarrels as well, to the south lies the People's Revolutionary Council, a warlord clique of former Soviets. It's no secret that the militarist Soviets have wronged us before, now is the time to settle this difference for good!"
 KHA_expansion_debolshevize_the_soviets_desc:0 "The Bolshevik system spits in the face of the traditional purpose of the worker's union. Designed with the express purpose of giving the workers sway over their rulers, this is the opposite of how trade unions operated under Vasilevsky. Unions must be removed of management by the central government if they are not then they are nothing more than extensions of the state. "
 KHA_expansion_secure_the_frontier_desc:0 "With the liberation of the major cities in the south, the Black Army has found itself with a much larger swath of territory to manage and patrol. While recruitment numbers are on the up and up, willing or otherwise, the newly liberated lands will need some time to adjust from the stark transition from lives of tyranny to those of freedom. The Black Army desperately needs a breather and so do the people of Siberia, we are more than happy to comply."
 KHA_expansion_increased_local_cooperation_desc:0 "The statist actors of Russia have ensured that the term anarchy is synonymous with chaos, death, and destruction, this could not be farther from the truth. In truth, anarchy is what the state fears most, it doesn't mean the total breakdown of society with no control, it simply means they have no control. Due to the conditioning of the previous regimes, Siberian leftists are wary of cooperating with us but with a simple explanation of our true values and policies, they'll be quick to fold into the ranks. "
 KHA_expansion_revolutionary_security_administration_desc:0 "Rats lurk around every corner, spies, saboteurs, terrorists, hide under the cover of darkness to exercise the will of the bourgeoisie against the common man. With all of the land being only just recently liberated, a majority of the population either does not understand what we fight for or actively fights against it. To keep the peace and ensure a smooth transition, the Black Army will keep an eye on the rabble-rousers by administering them as military districts."
 KHA_expansion_ground_the_siberian_falcon_desc:0 "An utter abomination has existed on the boundaries of the patrol zones of the Black Army for too long. A military dicatorship wearing a mask of a republic, demands liberation. The anti-union policies and the restrictions of the right to strike and protests against a government have proven that the Siberian Falcon does not soar, but circles above the decaying corpse of a city it killed. Immediate intervention is essential to end the suffering of the workers writhing in agony under the talon of the Falcon."
 KHA_expansion_return_the_peoples_wealth_desc:0 "Politics is a dirty game, one with a simple rule. "I scratch your back, you scratch mine." The Silovik, or those who exploited their position as minster or job in law enforcement to further advance their career, are the reigning champions of the game of politics. They spend their entire lives eliminating the enemies of the current regime and when the time comes for them to make their move, there's no one left to stop them. It is high time that those who use power for their own gain learn that they are just as vulnerable. All men think they are invincible until the barrel of the gun points the other direction."
 KHA_expansion_speak_to_the_agrarians_desc:0 "The compassionate rule of Ivan Zavoloko is something that looks appealing at start, a man who wishes to establish a state where the beliefs of him and his followers can flourish into something greater. While Ivan is far from the picturesque peaceful leader he is cut out to be, his goal is admirable. His people deserve the right to freedom just like anyone else. It would be a pointless slaughter to dispatch a Black Army militia into the area, instead, the General Assembly has given the green light to begin talks for peaceful integration."
 KHA_expansion_a_progressive_peasantry_desc:0 "Now that the conservative peasants of Zavoloko have organized themselves into a commune, it is time to shift the local Overton Window to the left. Anarchism is not a good first step for them. Progressive ideals shall be implemented incrementally, starting first with liberal democracy, social democracy, socialism, and ending up at anarchism down the line. It'll only be a matter of time before they are saying companion like the rest."
 KHA_expansion_bring_down_the_leviathan_desc:0 "The former masters of Siberia are no more than a husk of their former selves, an idealistic democracy in which everyone has a free chance to succeed. Everyone, provided that you are not a factory worker unable to unionize or a common man who wakes up to the dog and pony show of a sham republic. The inhabitants of Tomsk are not evil, their vision is just misguided, we must correct their course and bring them the freedom the politicians promised!"
 KHA_expansion_revolutionize_the_apparatus_desc:0 "Our communes pride themselves in the grand vision they share for Russia, one of absolute liberation, not concessions from a Tsar or a faux worker's state headed by authoritarians who wish to continue the same policies of oppression of the last regime. The Central Siberian Republic was yet another sham republic made to lure in the downtrodden seeking a place of freedom. Not all of its founders share that same goal and some truly do believe in a brighter tomorrow. We must weed out the good and the bad to ensure only those loyal to our cause get through."
 KHA_expansion_rely_on_the_peoples_justice_desc:0 "Galanskov, a seasoned veteran and ardent follower of anarchism, and Stepanov, the less headstrong, more calculated of the pair, have called for a rally in the city of Kansk to announce their new policy towards justice in the Free Territory. While surrounding states decry the free people of Siberia for their brutality, what they are really saying is that they are afraid, scared that one day the people will break down the walls of their palace and bring them to justice. The people are the ones who have suffered, it is only fair they get to enjoy the suffering of the reactionaries as well."
 KHA_expansion_martial_tribunals_desc:0 "As the Free Territory continues to expand, so does the Black Army with the fruits of success bringing many idealistic youth to the door of their local recruiting station. They come expecting to find combat, to defend their home, and we plan to oblige, although not in the way they imagined. They will do battle with words, not guns, and defend their home from criminals, by determining who belongs in jail and who belongs in a ditch."
 KHA_expansion_freedom_has_been_found_desc:0 "No one would expect that anarchism would resonate so well with the people. Years of indoctrination had solidified the idea that anarchism was equivalent to death itself. However, anarchy brought life instead. Growing a community, a family, of people together to fight for what they truly believed in. It took some convincing to show the bordering states the beauty of this system, but now, they can see clear, they see the sunrise over the horizon and they are free to embrace it with open arms. Freedom has been found in the most unlikely place."

 KHA_regional_into_a_brighter_tomorrow_desc:0 "Despite our struggles, the Siberian Black Army has managed to beat all of our enemies and unite Central Siberia! However, our work does not stop here, as there is much to be done. Firstly and most importantly, many new villages, towns, and even cities have come under our control, and we must work to help organize all of our new lands into proper communes. Furthermore, we must begin the long process of helping the people acclimate and understand why anarchism is the proper future of Russia.\n\nLurking and mostly unspoken is the fear that the Siberian Soviet will be subsumed by the Black Army, leading to the anarchist dream falling into the trappings of a military junta. While some of these fears may have merit, we can hopefully find a solution that allows for us to maintain freedom while preventing chaos!"
 KHA_regional_consolidate_the_regional_courts_desc:0 "The new territories under our control have to be consolidated and reformed into proper anarchist communes. The solution, at first glance, is to simply let the people organize themselves into communes. However, while this may seem simply easy on paper, the actual process over this reformation has caused quite the ideological debate. The people of Central Siberia have never lived under an anarchist society, and likely have no idea how to organize themselves. Furthermore, it is also likely that there are too many who still wish to see our dream foiled. Therefore, we are left with a choice. Do we allow the people to self-organize, as our ideology tells us to, or do we have the Black Army provisionally lead these lands until they are ready to properly organize?"
 KHA_regional_instate_provisional_leadership_desc:0 "Despite our hopes otherwise, the leaders of the SIberian Soviet know the truth. Too many of the people in the newly conquered lands are opposed to anarchism as of right now, and letting the people self-organize would only invite sabotage. While it might sting, we have no choice but to let the Black Army provisionally lead the new lands until we can be certain that the people are ready to self-organize. It may seem contradictory, but we have to do this for the sake of the revolution. With luck, the people will acclimate to anarchism quickly and control can be handed over properly to the future anarchist communes, preventing the authority of the Black Army from becoming too entrenched."
 KHA_regional_faith_in_the_newly_integrated_desc:0 "To let the Black Army control our new lands would be nothing but an absolute betrayal of our ideology! It may seem inane, but allowing the Black Army to control our new lands sets a bad precedent. After all, if we expand farther, why shouldn't the Black Army control those new lands until the people are acclimated to anarchism? In any case, showing that we don't trust the people undermines anarchism here in Siberia as a whole. After all, one of the major tenets of anarchism is mutual cooperation, and failing to extend a hand in trust does nothing but sabotage our hopes from the very beginning! There may be those who are unwilling to self-organize, but through proper execution of anarchist ideology as compared to throwing the army around like a fascist state, we can forge an anarchist society that is truly free!"
 KHA_regional_strike_the_balance_of_power_desc:0 "The Black Army is undeniably a powerful authority, and we've had to rely greatly upon them throughout all of our struggles and expansion. Such a reliance is worrying to many, and the fears of the Black Army eventually forming a military junta in all but name are widespread. Of course, we cannot allow such a tragedy to occur, especially after coming so far. To prevent the Black army from controlling too much power, we must take efforts to reinforce the soviets and communes. Strengthening the civilian councils, combined with transferring Black Army tasks to other, more representative organs will allow us to maintain our anarchist ideals even in the fact of threats!"
 KHA_regional_extend_the_communication_systems_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues that we have encountered in our expansion is a lack of communication ability. It can take days, even weeks to find out about various events that occur in the more rural areas. Furthermore, the need for better communication and coordination with our rural comrades is critical in this time of reorganization, as access to superior resources and ending any lurking threats are matters of the utmost importance. This communication expansion will be done by extending telegraph lines, building new radio towers, and constructing a modern phone system, allowing us to reach even the most isolated of communities. No longer will we be left in the dark when it comes to rural matters!"
 KHA_regional_correct_the_misguided_teachings_desc:0 "Education is undoubtedly the foundation of our future. After all, it is education that instills values in the youth, and it is education that people refer back to throughout their life. While there are aspects of the old Soviet and CSR teaching that were taught correctly and properly, there are many other aspects that must be retaught to the populace in order for them to become model anarchists. Most importantly, we must highlight the failures of the states to bring long-term stability and peace to central Siberia, and similarly showcase how anarchist thought will succeed where the puppet democracy and statist thought has failed. It may take time, but the people will finally understand the truth of anarchism!"
 KHA_regional_cast_down_social_injustice_desc:0 "Throughout the centuries, the Russian states in whatever form they may have taken have created a culture of inequality. Women are, more often than not, seen as inferior to men, and consigned to be housewives. People of other races have faced similar criticism, being viewed with suspicion for no other reason than prejudice. However, the group who has had it the worst of all are homosexuals. They barely have even a right to exist, with many having persecuted those unlucky enough to be revealed. Such prejudices have no place in an anarchist society. We must work to break the chains that shackle our women, show people that race is merely appearance and nothing more, and allow our homosexual comrades to finally be able to freely love whomever they want!"
 KHA_regional_enshrine_the_material_rights_desc:0 "Every human, no matter what, deserves the right to live. Of course, one cannot merely just live. People require material resources such as food and water. In order to ensure that we truly uphold the right of everyone to live, we must also ensure that everyone, no matter who they are, has access to the necessities of life. In order to ensure this, we must help ensure that the communes are always able to provide whatever is necessary for people to live. Obviously, we will inform the communes of their duty, but we will also remind them that they have access to aid from the greater communes if need be. We will ensure that life is able to prosper under anarchism!"
 KHA_regional_establish_the_provisional_resource_council_desc:0 "With our access to new lands and resources, many comrades have pointed out a need to properly coordinate said resources so that the communes can properly function. To this end, we shall establish the Provisional Resource Council. This Council's main function will be ensuring the extraction and distribution of all resources within the Free Territory. To this end, the Council will be composed of workers from resource-gathering industries and representatives from areas who need resources. This Council will hopefully be able to solve any and all needs from the cities and villages involving resource needs, while allowing the workers who produce said resources a place to be heard."
 KHA_regional_the_last_congress_of_kansk_desc:0 "With the rapid growth of new lands for the Free Territory, it has become clear that a more central location is needed in order for the communes to properly coordinate. However, there are a few issues that still need to be worked out, and we must make sure that the movement of the communal congress to a more central city like Novosibirsk is done officially, through democratic vote. Therefore, we shall hold one final Congress in Kansk, to solve any remaining internal issues, before moving to Novosibirsk!"
 KHA_regional_rectify_the_rural_urban_split_desc:0 "The first major issue that the Congress of Kansk has chosen to focus on is the urban-rural split. While most of our rural comrades have been able to begin reorganizing the villages into proper anarchist communes, our urban comrades have had difficulties. The large population of the cities combined with the high concentration of people has led to efforts requiring more intensive care and resources in order to succeed. With the consolidation of some of the other new communes, we can afford to devote more time and effort into properly reorganizing the cities. These communal governments, more than anything, will set the model for any future communes. We must try our hardest to truly liberate all of the people who live in the Free Territory and show them the light of anarchism!"
 KHA_regional_honors_for_humanity_desc:0 "When the Soviet Union fell and the Central SIberian Republic splintered, the people were left adrift, with lawlessness plaguing the land. To deal with the chaos, many people turned to religion, leading to the church becoming a very powerful influence in Central Siberia. While we have no interest in outright banning the church, we must take steps to curb its influence on our populace. We must take efforts to educate the populace about secularism and inspire their hopes in the communes, lessening their dependence on the church for stability. We shall also utilize the church wealth that we have been able to obtain for our own purposes instead of returning it to the church. Such efforts may seem controversial to some of our comrades, but it is necessary to help forge a better society!"
 KHA_regional_present_the_cure_desc:0 "When the Tsar was deposed, the people turned to another government in the form of the USSR. When the USSR fell, the people turned to yet another government in the CSR. Yet in the end, the CSR fell, like the two governments before it. These states were unable to deal with the problems that plagued Russia, and so they collapsed. However, where statism has failed, anarchism has succeeded! Indeed, in a short period of time, Central Siberia has soared by leaps and bounds! Indeed, it seems that Russia has fallen ill, and anarchism is the obvious cure to its woes! We owe it to be the stalwart doctors that ensure that the cure is properly administered!"
 KHA_regional_liberty_all_encompassing_and_eternal_desc:0 "With all major issues settled, the last Congress at Kansk has begun to wind down. All major internal issues seem to have been settled, with the creation of communes and councils proceeding smoothly. The Congress shall conclude with the formal vote to have all future meetings be based in Novosibirsk. Against all odds, the Free Territory has not only been able to expand, but prosper and spread anarchism all across Central Siberia! We fought in Ukraine, we fought in Catalonia, and finally, here in Central Siberia, we have succeeded. Freedom has been brought to the people, and a new dawn approaches for the Free Territory. A new dawn in which we are all able to enjoy the fruits of liberty!"
 KHA_regional_develop_the_free_territory_desc:0 "Our territory was never a major focus for the former Soviet government. While we did receive investment in the form of an expanded Trans-Siberian Railroad and some upgraded machinery for our urban centers, the Soviet Union simply didn't have the time or resources to invest into our home like it did in other regions. This wasn't always meant to be the case, however. The Siberian Plan would have included increased development of our civilian infrastructure, an expansion of the cities, and major investments into our military industrial plants. There would have been almost complete vertical integration of our military industry, from the extraction of unrefined iron in the ground all the way to the manufacture and distribution of Kalashnikovs. While this plan was unfeasible at the time, given our newfound resources, these plans can finally be realized."
 KHA_regional_integrate_the_urban_economies_desc:0 "Urban areas have always been somewhat difficult to integrate into the communal economy that we practice. Unable to provide food for themselves, oftentimes cities would be able to trade weapons produced in the city for food in the adjacent towns. With the development of localized production of guns in town centers now, this economic balance has been thrown off. In order to compensate for this lost revenue stream for the cities, we must encourage the cities to better utilize their resources, namely their larger skill pool and additional manpower, to produce more specialized items and civilian goods that they can use to continue bringing capital and food into the cities."
 KHA_regional_re_organize_the_industrial_centers_desc:0 "At its heart, communism is about the community above all else, and the idea that everyone can contribute to a common good. Such an ideal of community is easy to develop in tight knit village or town communities, but far more difficult in large cities. We must endeavor to promote a feeling of solidarity and brotherhood among citizens living in these cities. Such community begins in the workplace, among your coworkers and colleagues in the factory. In order to achieve this, we will rip out the old ideas of the boss worker relationship and institute a new system of worker self management."
 KHA_regional_encourage_the_kostinsty_desc:0 "The Kostinsty are a militant worker's organization that have existed in the area before we arrived. While our politics are not perfectly aligned, with their leadership seemingly leaning towards pre-war Bukharinist philosophy as opposed to our more radical anarcho communist policies, their organizational expertise and influence could prove incredibly useful to us. Their leadership has indicated that they are not opposed to working alongside us, and have offered assistance in the implementation of our redesigned Siberian Plan. We would be fools not to accept their offer."
 KHA_regional_the_bounty_of_the_siberian_plan_desc:0 "The Siberian Plan is almost complete. Already thousands of industrial machines, distributed across the whole of Siberia both to cities and towns alike, are being installed and tested for the first time. Electrical light is beginning to shine in places that had never so much as seen a light bulb before, just as thousands of positions in new coal plants across Siberia open up. The standard of living for millions across Siberia is about to experience a quantum leap, and in doing so we will thrust ourselves into becoming one of the foremost industrial powers of Russia. At this rate, we may one day eclipse even Germany..."
 KHA_regional_lessons_from_the_union_desc:0 "The Siberian plan has been a greater success than we could have ever thought possible. Even before its completion, industrial productivity across Siberia has grown by over 200 percent. In the past month alone, energy production in Siberia has grown by over 330 million kilowatt-hours, approximately the same amount as the Hoover dam produces every month. And all this has been by the mandate of our Security Council. Voices of fears that such a council might detract from our civil liberties, or even worsen the long term prosperity of our nation are now silent in the face of such great accomplishment."
 KHA_regional_reach_for_the_dawn_desc:0 "Rigid economic planning both restricts the rights of our citizens, and harms our economy long term. If we truly wish to see Russia prosper, and the glory of communism prevail, we must abandon these authoritarian ideas of controlling the economy through the state. Bukharin tried, and failed. If we wish to see true prosperity, we must allow worker's organizations and unions to decide for themselves what to produce as a natural reaction to the needs and demands of society and the economy. While some decry such a system as capitalism under another name, we reject such a title. This is a true socialist economy."
 KHA_regional_encourage_the_peasant_communes_desc:0 "Communism is inherently an ideology that favours the community over private individuals. What greater community is there of men and women than that of their whole land? We must encourage isolated rural communities, typically left unrepresented in government, to reach out and join the economic and political scene of the country. While production in a single rural community might be small, if all the rural towns and villages across the Free Territory work together, then they will know true prosperity."
 KHA_regional_develop_the_altai_region_desc:0 "Altai is a region of great industrial potential. While infrastructure is minimal in the region, its natural resources are practically untapped, and has a large enough population to sustain several mineral extraction and factory sites. Even just the first step to achieving this goal of industrialization within this region, that being laying down railway tracks, should be enough to begin boosting agricultural and mineral output over the course of the next few weeks as we begin pouring resources into the region."
 KHA_regional_facilitate_rural_mechanization_desc:0 "One of the important features of communal life is self sufficiency. While this is often not possible, given that more rural communities simply do not have the skilled labour or industrial facilities to produce things like modern electronics or automobiles, we can set these communities up with the means to acquire such items. By facilitating mechanization in the rural areas of the Free Territory, we can help rural communes outproduce their needs, allowing them to exchange the extra produce and livestock for items the rural population cannot obtain. Not to mention, having an agricultural surplus will be useful for expanding the population."
 KHA_regional_ensure_rural_interconnection_desc:0 "There are rural regions of the free territory that are simply unfit for major industrialization and expansion. These regions are either too isolated, or not populous enough, or are in an area vulnerable to foreign invasion. For these areas, the best we can do is extend infrastructure to connect their territories to our own. This can be done in a variety of ways, from building actual roads or railroads, to setting up phone lines or the simpler telegraph lines, to extending the power grid into their territory. This won't provide manufacturing jobs for these people, but it will hopefully allow them to attain somewhat of a higher standard of living."
 KHA_regional_enlightenment_for_all_desc:0 "While Russia has been embroiled in the constant civil wars and skirmishes that have resulted because of this warlordism, the superpowers of the world have been advancing their technological arsenal. From the space race to the development of transistor computing, they have expanded their computational, agricultural, and industrial output tenfold, while we have been forced to rely on decades old machinery. If we are to bring ourselves up to their level, we must begin investing into the local schools, universities, and labs in the Free Territory. Giving these centers of learning funding and autonomy is the surest way to raise our educational standard."
 KHA_regional_the_interventionist_approach_desc:0 "All around Russia there are nations with the capability to destroy our nation with the press of a button. Thousands of ICBMs, SLBMs, and IRBMs are armed and ready to rain down atomic fire upon Russia should those nations choose to do so. Even without such weapons, crushing our nation would be easy with modern guns and missiles they have at their disposal. Our technological ability has stagnated heavily since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and that has left our nation vulnerable. While we do not currently possess the technology or skilled technical workers capable of developing these weapons, creating an education system under the supervision of the military council will surely help us begin to bridge the gap in technological ability."
 KHA_regional_trust_in_the_educators_desc:0 "Some have argued that in order to bring our educational system up to par with our more advanced neighbors, we need to place the educational system under the power of the military council, so that we might bring all students and educators to the same level of educational quality across the board. This is foolish. Different regions will have different needs. Rural villages might want to teach their students about tractor maintenance and engine repair, whereas cities might want to educate their students in power production and computer science. We should trust local educators to decide on a curriculum that benefits their community's needs."
 KHA_regional_inspire_progressive_thought_desc:0 "Control of education is of the utmost importance to the security of the Free Territory. While the military council would like to leave the communes' educators to their own devices, it would invite subversion and reactionary ideas to be indoctrinated into our nation's youth. Anarchism as a whole would be threatened if the military doesn't step in and prevent its collapse. The fifth column must be stopped. To that end, we will create an all encompassing curriculum that will teach both the basics necessary for the students to function as adults as well as professing the tenets of anarchism."
 KHA_regional_the_guardians_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Free Territory's borders are always at risk. Warlords, bandits, and raiders stand ready to raid and loot our cities and towns at the drop of a dime. It has become necessary to begin reforming the militia into a fully fledged army. In order to achieve this, we will need to invest into more specialized equipment, like anti-tank, anti-air, and sniper weapons, in order to increase our army's effectiveness. Additionally, we will need to begin increasing the discipline of our army. These men can no longer simply be volunteer farmers, they must be soldiers, and we will drill this into them."
 KHA_regional_maintain_the_flawless_legacy_desc:0 "We cannot abandon our roots. The militia organization that is the Black Army is one that is for and by the people. We cannot go back upon this legacy now. Abandoning this legacy would mean fundamentally changing the foundation of our society. Additionally, given that the military is so intertwined with our government, by instituting a top down structure of organization in the Black army, we would be inviting corruption and the threat of coup from the ruling generals in a newly reformed army. For the safety of our anarchic way of life, despite its faults, we must maintain our election based military."
 KHA_regional_welcome_the_rehabilitated_desc:0 "The Black Army has been supremely successful in its march of conquest across Siberia, but cracks are starting to show in the army. Our manpower reserves have been slowly atrophied as our reunification efforts have progressed, and we may not be able to rely on our home communes for many more men. In order to rectify this, we should begin integrating conquered militaries into our ranks. Not only would it alleviate our manpower issues, but it would also ease integration of their territory into ours considerably."
 KHA_regional_lessons_from_the_liberation_war_desc:0 "The wars we have fought in our efforts to reunify Russia were not one by sheer brute force and manpower, like those Russia has fought in the past, but rather with the cunning and finesse of smart generals and strategic thinking. We can use these reports and plans and draw on the experience of these generals and commanders to continue developing the military doctrines the old Soviet government had begun developing in the Second World War. Already, we have begun collecting and teaching the strategies used in the previous conflicts in our military schools."
 KHA_regional_industrial_warfare_desc:0 "The Great War of so many decades past was catastrophic not only in its casualties, but also in its material consumption. The lesson had been learned by all nations of the world after the war. The development of heavy artillery, tanks, and aeroplanes meant that wars of the future would demand a strong industry to support the militaries of the future. This theory has been proved correct. Our military conquests have only been possible thus far due to the hard workers at home pushing out thousands of guns, artillery, and planes month after month. Unfortunately, the farther our military ventures out into Russia, the large our military needs to become to defend our long borders. Thus, we must expand our military industry to keep pace with our industry."
 KHA_regional_reinforce_the_soldiers_desc:0 "The military machine continues to demand more and more manpower as we spread out across Russia. In order to sate this demand, we must boost recruitment in newly conquered territories. While volunteers have always been welcome from newly integrated territory, the amount of volunteers joining up was always tiny. Simply put, conquered peoples do not take well to their conquerors, even though we have afforded these people almost complete autonomy. We must begin a mass recruitment drive in the new communes and endear ourselves to the populace. With hope, we should see increased enlistment in the new territories."
 KHA_regional_following_the_falcon_desc:0 "Defeating Novosibirsk was no simple task. While their army might not have been as strong as ours, their air force certainly outshined ours. We suffered far too many casualties at the hands of enemy air support to ignore this problem any more. Thankfully, we no longer need to. Novosibirsk is home to one of the largest aircraft production plants in all of Russia, and consequently is also home to one of the largest air fleets in Russia. Additionally, this fleet will be serviced by some of the best plane mechanics in Siberia. The Free Territory takes another step into modernity."
 KHA_regional_black_wings_above_desc:0 "The Black Army has had little experience with aerial warfare in the past. While we have used some planes in combat in the past, simply put, we didn't have the industrial capacity or skilled airmen needed to operate an air force. Given our size and the relative strength of our enemies however, we must create and integrate a true air force into our military forces. We have a vast array of former pilots to educate the next generation of airmen, somewhat modern designs for airplanes, and the industrial capacity to begin manufacturing said airplanes."
 KHA_regional_experimental_helicopter_designs_desc:0 "Helicopters are one of the many technological advances made by the world while Russia regressed into infighting and warlordism. These strange flying devices are unlike airplanes of the past, in that they use a vertical rotor liftoff system whose benefits include aerial attacks on ground targets and even transporting troops and supplies to areas where a landing strip is not available. The devices have great potential, as seen from their performance in the South African War, and domestic development has already begun."
 KHA_regional_past_the_tachanka_desc:0 "Modern armoured and motorized technology has once again changed warfare for Russia. Formerly, our design had revolved around building large amounts of cheap tanks to overwhelm the German enemy. While tank production never reached the amounts needed to truly test this military doctrine, many generals had supported the idea of simply overwhelming their enemies. However, research into the tanks doctrines of Japan and Germany have indicated a focus on mobility and quality. We should strive to learn from their doctrines and designs and update our armoured and motorized military tactics."
 KHA_regional_tanks_for_peace_desc:0 "If Russia learned anything from the German invasion two decades ago, it was the utility and efficient brutality of mechanized warfare. Russian troops were cut up and overwhelmed by the speed and explosive power that panzer divisions had at their disposal. The failure of Bukharin to build a tank force capable of protecting the Soviet Union will not be repeated. Our neighbors have surely come to the same conclusions as us. Developing an armoured corps for the Black Army must become a priority if we wish to secure our borders."
 KHA_regional_compile_the_strategies_desc:0 "Despite recent efforts to reform the army and enforce some form of basic military doctrine, many officers end up implementing their own tactics or offensive strategy many times in opposition of what might be optimal. We should endeavor to create a unified military doctrine that our officers can follow in order to further whatever grand strategy is being implemented during any wars we might be involved with in the future.. This will allow us to get a better understanding of how the war is going and as to the capabilities of our troops, instead of simply hoping that an officer makes the right decision."
 KHA_regional_military_egalitarianism_desc:0 "One of the most outstanding features of the Black Army was its democratic military structure. Unlike most every other army, power was derived not from the top, among the generals and highest ranking military leaders, but rather from the lowest soldiers, who elected their own officers and promoted those who they thought were best equipped. The generals at the top of the military command structure are considered no more equal in terms of value than any other man in the military, and it is precisely because of this that our men fight as hard as they do."
 KHA_regional_the_tomsk_firearms_collective_desc:0 "While the people of Tomsk are well suited to our style of democracy, having already had local democratic structures they could use, they have yet to adopt the gun culture so vital to our defense. People either do not have the interest or the money to purchase weapons, and most did not feel the need to have one, feeling that their armies would protect them. Our presence here indicates that this was obviously not true. Thus, we should create an organization to educate the people of Tomsk as to the need and operation of guns."
 KHA_regional_an_army_for_liberation_desc:0 "The ultimate duty of Black army must be to spread our anarchist way of life to all of Russia, so that the peoples of creeds might be freed from the tyranny of states. More so than defense, we must prepare ourselves to be on the offense. Traditionally, conscripts signed up for the Black Army in order to defend our homes, not conquer others. We must convince them that in order to defend ourselves, we must liberate everyone else. Soon, all of Russia will fly the black flag."
 KHA_regional_an_army_for_self_defense_desc:0 "The purpose of our militias have always been to protect, not to harm. The Black Army is not like the terrorizing force of Yagoda. They fought for domination and power, we fight for peace and bread. Our past conquests should have little bearing on our future. In order to preserve the dignity and integrity of the Siberian Black Army and the Free Territory, we must prevent ourselves from following down the same tyrannical path our predecessors did, and perhaps in doing so we might finally find prosperity."
 KHA_regional_looking_outwards_desc:0 "Geopolitics is a game of diplomacy and tact just as much as it is armies and wars. In order to secure the Free Territories, we must assess our standing with our neighbors to the west and the east to assess whether they are a threat to us or not, and if they are to assess how much of a threat they pose. And, should we find ourselves to be fortunate to share a border with a nation friendly to the Free Territory, arranging some trade deals or defensive pacts might serve to benefit our interests."
 KHA_regional_a_policy_of_liberation_desc:0 "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of global liberation. If an opportunity to support our fellow socialists or anarchist friends abroad, we should seize the opportunity to do so. Arms, funding, technology... If there exists a need, we shall strive to provide for it. Let us be the kindling that sparks the flames of revolution in all nations. It may cause us to lose reputation among our global peers, perhaps even spark aggression on their part, but if we can help liberate even one oppressed peoples, then we will know that our efforts have not been in vain."
 KHA_regional_a_policy_of_protection_desc:0 "The security council, after deliberating on the issue for some time, has announced a policy of protection. The last thing we need is to anger the likes of Japan or Germany and spark another war to devastate Russia. Should the socialists and anarchists liberate themselves from their oppressors, or begin a campaign to do in their own nation, they will have our full support, but not our weapons. Besides, nothing good can ever come of intervening in a foreign conflict. Just look at the United States, it's doubtful they ever expected to be in South Africa as long as they did."
 KHA_regional_exporting_the_revolution_desc:0 "In order to support our socialist and anarchist friends around the world, we will need to first find them. A new organization will be created, clandestine in nature and global in scale. Its purpose? To find and aid the revolutionaries of the world, even the ones that don't yet know they are yet. From just beyond our borders to the farthest reaches of Africa and South America, our men will be there, providing both the means and motivation for the people to liberate themselves. Some might call it propaganda, we prefer to call it the truth."
 KHA_regional_declare_a_safe_harbor_desc:0 "The world has become a harsh place. Across the world, individuals are being persecuted for race, religion, ideology, you name it. The Free Territory isn't like that. We are one of the few nations on Earth that can profess to be truly free. We must open our borders to the world and become the safe harbor of the world. So long as you do not intend to cause harm or havok within our borders, you are welcome to join our grand experiment. Additionally, immigration has its own benefits for us as well. The more numerous we are, the better we can protect ourselves."
 KHA_regional_an_eye_to_the_world_desc:0 "Russia is a harsh mistress, and our neighbors are even harsher. We need to know what they are doing at all times in order to defend ourselves. To that end, we must create some kind of clandestine organization to achieve this end. Should our neighbors begin mobilizing against us, we will know. If our neighbors develop new tanks and aircraft, we will know. If the leader of our neighbour country goes to walk his dog, we will know. With this new agency, the Black Army will have a hand in every folder and an eye on every nation."
 KHA_regional_solidarity_with_the_world_desc:0 "Building a spy agency is no simple task. It requires time and patience to build something so large and important in secret. Decisions to be made, directions to take. For example, defensive intelligence organizations are often operated and structured differently than more aggressive intelligence services. A focus on long term infiltration and surveillance may be more important than foreign instigation and smuggling. Neither choice is poor, just a different way in which to allocate your resources."

The Tsar has not failed us, Buhkarin has not failed us, the Duma has not failed us, only one thing has ultimately let the people down, authority. Unchallenged and absolute authority cowers behind many symbols, the Swastika, the sun, the torch, all symptoms of the same overarching illness plaguing the world. The cure has been apparent since humanity's inception, cooperation. Anarchism is not the absence of normalcy, rather a return to it. Local communities work together for harvest and to repel wandering bandits. In lieu of manufactured division, the free people of Siberia seek a greater good.\n\nIn the sea of chaos and authoritarian rule, the Black Army stands as a vanguard for the downtrodden and vulnerable. The unfortunate reality of our situation is that we are unable to help everyone. Russia provides many challenges to the remote villages under the protection of the Black Army. Famine, the elements, and deranged savages haunt the minds of fathers toiling fields. Armies of old serve the state, not the people, the new anarchist age will be ushered in by the people's will, not the long arm of the state.\n\nForeign powers slander Russia for descending into complete anarchy, this is not anarchy, this is the curtain being pulled back to reveal the end state of oppression. While Russia may be in chaos, the free territory turns a different direction, not falling back on the same authority that shattered our home, but towards a future spearheaded by the will of the people."

It was a simple, well put together speech, just stand and read, how hard can that be? Peaking around the corner, he saw the seemingly unending lines of people begin to dwindle as every nook and cranny of the grand hall was occupied by grizzled veterans of the black army and the tightly bundled up mothers, gripping their children near.\n\nThere was only so much time left now.

It reminded him-\n\n"Companion Timofey Dmitrievich, you are solely recognized by this body, what news do you bring?" His face paled, while lost in thought, he had completely forgotten the entire meeting. He cleared his throat, flashing a nervous grin.

Many within the hoards of the Black Army could share the same story.\n\n"One doesn't know he's enslaved until he feels the tug of the chains," commanded Galanskov as he spoke before the assembled army, "It's far too easy to become blinded by the tricks of despots, and for that, I do not blame the common man. Where were we all decades ago? Servants to a union of the people, at last the workers had a state willing to empower them at every opportunity. But that wasn't the case, was it? The only people served by the union were those in the presidium! We will no longer bear witness to the circus of generals awaiting their turn to be the savior of Russia!" The crowded town square erupted into cheers, decrying tyranny. "Take up your arms! Today we embark on the long and arduous journey to the long-awaited funeral of exploitation!" The army rendered little more than raving mob by the oration, hoisted their weapons into the air. One by one, squads got into their vehicles and set for the west, for Krasnoyarsk."

Amongst the grizzled veterans of the Security Council, most of the day is occupied with yellowing maps with crinkled corners depicting a land long unseen. The 63rd Cavalry moved north to Minsk, a withdrawal from Kiev, the last stand at Leningrad relieved, that's all it would take! Despite the military shortcomings of Bukharin, one would be hard-pressed to say that the Siberian Plan did not breathe life into a dead area.\n\nAmidst the factories of Novosibirsk and the bustling rail center of Krasnoyarsk, the tranquil reservoir of Bratsk became the next area of interest of the Soviet Union. Here, Soviet engineers found promise in our waters, reallocating funds to the construction of the Bratsk hydroelectric plant. The dreams were big, an electrified Siberia that could run independent of the imports of foreign powers. Before this could be achieved, the Third Reich crushed their boot against the throat of the Soviets. As the war progressed, the numbers of the maintenance crew dwindled, as did the funds. It was there, our people left shivering in the cold, confused and alone, came to a realization. The Moscow elite did not need to make routine checks on the equipment, skilled labor and cooperation was the only guidance they needed.\n\nThough the dream was never brought to fruition by Bukharin, the gift bestowed upon us in the final moments of his empire has laid the framework for our next moves forward. With our hindsight the failure of the plan is obvious, the centralized system."

He took his attention away from his pride and joy, his magnum opus, and watched as the members of the council stepped up to the bench, ready for yet another seminar. Svyatopolk nodded to himself in reassurance, his job was done, for the most part, the decision was up to the council, he just had to present the options.\n\n"Good morning Companions, I am truly delighted to be here and I am sure you are all as well, the agenda today has just one topic, the focus of our industry going forwards. The report presented by Companion Koyal, while well together, is missing some very crucial data. Due to a combination of the massive amount of data lost in the collapse of both the Union and the Republic and the decentralized nature of our communes, the true state of industrial prowess by community was difficult to ascertain. As you can see," Svyatopolk heaved the hefty stack of papers into the air, "that data is more accessible and more accurate than before.

There are two areas of concern, the light industry sector, and the rate of construction. In the status-quo we are relying on what can be best described as medieval factories. Construction of new industrial hubs would take much time and be a much larger investment. On the other hand, we could carry on with the means we have now but raise the quotas, which would be cheaper but may leave our people disenfranchised. Ultimately, the decision is yours.""

One may say that Bukharin was a hero, a man who took up arms against the Tsar, answering the call of the motherland and valiantly returning back to his birthplace in its time of need. Using his position to elevate the cause of the worker into the mainstream, some would say that Bukharin had only noble intentions, seeking to bring the often forgotten territories of Russia on par with the rest with his ambitious Siberian Plan.\n\nAnother would tell you that Bukharin betrayed the ideals of the revolution, sensing an opportunity for power and slinking back into Russia, out from his hiding in America where he lived a privileged life of bourgeoisie decadence. Upon his arrival, Bukharin molded the works of Lenin into his own image, making the increasing of his power his number one priority. The Siberian Plan was not a gift in any sense of the word, yet another curse, more exploitation, the same story of despots turning people into pawns, labourers into mere drones to do their bidding to increase their status or wealth.\n\nSome would rant and rave about the Judeo-bolshevik menace that came to Russia from the heartland of Jewry, America, and came to Russia to impose the will of Zion. Breaking down centuries of tradition and culture, whipped away with a single bullet to the head of the Tsar. In the eyes of these men, the Siberian plan was nothing more than an extension of the pre-existing conspiracy established by the red army.\n\nWe have challenged these narrow visions, one can not judge the Siberian Plan on a basis of good or bad, the plan is just as Russia is today; fractured. Like Russia, we will pick up the pieces, picking out the best of the pieces of the plan and rejuvenating the program to accomplish what was promised, a plan for the people."

Praising the policies of Bukharin and risking his life in the name of anarchy was something he had struggled to reconcile with, and judging by the tribunal before him, they did as well.\n\n"Traitor!"

Where did the Union get you?"\n\nGaspar felt the burning sensation in his face, rage. The prisoner hung his head in a vain attempt to save face.

To a simpler man, it seemed like an obvious choice, delegating the most daunting of tasks upwards to the professionals.

Zechariah assembled the outline of a speech, it wouldn't take much to sway them away from the blatant grab for power.\n\nAs the minutes turned to hours, men and women alike stumbled into the isolated cabin. In between stories and pleasant small talk between the different delegates, Mikhail happened to glance at his watch, "I believe we are all here!" A wave of silence rushed over the nosy room. "Good to have you all, I know it's quite a perilous journey these days but your presence means the world. I'd hate to drag you all the way out here for something of little importance but as Companion Zechariah will tell you, it is far from it. Right Zecharia?" Mikhail smiled to his friend.\n\n"Thank you, Companion Mikhail, he is right that I cannot stress this enough, we cannot approve the current motion today, delegating crucial defensive industrial administration to the Security Council. Something we often take for granted is how lucky we are to live as truly free individuals, not herded around like sheep. Approving this motion would rip the beating heart of anarchism out of the people and leave it to the will of the Black Army."\n\n"I don't mind at all honesty. We are not handing these powers to a dictator, but to our common man." Piped up a member of the audience. "I don't see much of a problem here, a bureaucracy isn't a Tsar." Echoed another. Zechariah was flabbergasted, a centralized industrial council would spit in the face of all those who fought and died for liberty! Zechariah did not get to voice his opinion, however, the masses had already made up their minds, the economy was much safer in the hands of the Security Council. "

The answer to that question is obvious; yes. From that point on, Russia has to paths to follow, one of absolution and one with a lasting chance to survive. The young, the idealists, they would have the Black Army cast away the moment it outlived its usefulness, they consider the men and women who fought for the liberation of Russia a burden, an army as a state. In their ideal world, the Black Army would be dismantled in favor of peasant militias who band together for the ultimate good of safeguarding each other. These delusions of the power of friendship saving Russia from being shattered are unfounded.\n\nIn truth, the vultures would begin to swarm the moment the Black Army is weakened. The Japanese to the east will spring on any opportunity to expand their sphere of influence, establishing slave colonies in their wake. The Germans have made it clear their mission is to nip any attempt in European liberty in the bud. It would only be a matter of time before the Wehrmacht demolishes the petty armies set up. The Americans too, always hungry for an opportunity to weaken a nation out of their grasp, would be chomping at the bit to set a sham republic in whatever is left of Russia.\n\nAlternatively, the Black Army could remain post-unification, bolstered by the droves of Russians anxious to finally experience a day without oppression, a day where they were not property, and stand up to the foreign threats. The opportunistic, power-hungry, greedy, warlords, of Russia, salivate at the idea of a world with no Black Army, nothing, nothing, can be more important than the role the Black Army."

I picked up the crown in spite of my actions against the Tsar. I'm not power-hungry Mr. Galanskov, I am hungry for change, just as my subjects. Russia is not capable of governing without a monarch, look outside to see the result of the workers state. My offer to the people was simple, a strong culture and a free people. I do not consider that a crime."\n\n"As always, you hide behind half-truths and doctored facts. We did not bring you here to reprimand you for freedom." commented Stepanov, "Your lies can only go so far, promises of reform that were not more than wasted breath as you assured the reactionary elements a strong kingdom will emerge. The monarchy is dead. The presidium is dead Nikolay. You live in an authoritarian past, blinded by a free future." In a rare moment of solidarity, Stepanov cast a knowing glance at Galanskov.\n\n"Companion Nikolay, this tribunal finds you guilty on all charges, hope that when your body finally decays in prison will bring freedom to Siberia, for once, you've done something good." Galanskov, Stepanov, and the remaining members of the tribunal gathered their things. Nikolay fixated his eyes on the tile at his feet. Throughout it all, there was always an escape, a man to bribe, a place to flee, but as he felt the grip of the officer on his shoulder, he knew his luck had run out."

When he had received the news of Kyzyl falling into anarchy, he had assumed it was more agitation between the Mongolians and the Russians. Often people overreacted like that, it was all politics which was never his forte. Oktai was content with his simple life, he would wake up in the morning, head to the factory, and sip his coffee. He worked of course but preferred to leave the bulk of the job to his subordinates. When what he assumed to be bandits arrived at the factory, Oktai was sure he would meet his end. Instead, the Black Army brought him into the center of Altay and organized an emergency trial for what they claimed was the administrator of oppression in Mongolia.\n\n"Mr. Oktai, during your tenure as head of the arms factory, would you say you managed your employees faithfully?" He nodded. "Then I would ask you to explain why you employed children in a hazardous environment."\n\nOktai was terrified, his cheerful demeanor gone. He wanted to speak in his defense but could not find the words. Luckily he didn't have to, "Oktai let me work when no one else would!" said a young voice from within the audience. "I have to work for my family!"\n\nThe officers whipped their heads to the crowd, "Who said that? You boy, you are no more than ten, you should not reward the system that forces you into slavery, granting clemency to this man only teaches the reactionaries they can get away with this!\n\n"Okati is no slaver, he got the Council to get me enough food to survive the winter!" shouted another voice from the spectators.\n\n"That doesn't change-"\n\n"Okati is invaluable to this community! He's done too much good to toss him aside for ideological views!" The crowd roared in approval, demanding freedom.

The social democratic party was much more up his alley, but yet, wether he feared the repercussions or if deep down in his heart he saw the potential for greatness, Misha agreed to travel to the newly liberated territory.\n\n"Here." He commanded, "This is the place." Mongolia was never an industrial powerhouse, Misha was familiar with the Khanate that once laid claim to the entirety of Eurasia, but this was not the grandiose house of a Ghengis. This was meeting hall eight in the retirement home. Misha threw the door open, his entourage following closely behind. The scene before him brought a smile to the bitter old man. The hammer and sickle, the rose, the brilliant tapestry of a star atop the Soyombo. The military may have been lacking but the arts and crafts department surely got all the budget. A little under a hundred men and women crowded into the room, each wearing some memorabilia of their respective party.\n\n"Greetings companions!" Misha faked a large grin and followed the script."The massive turnout here shows something, we are making real progress!" Misha put his all into the act, but the unenthused crowd was having no part in it. "Now I want you to take a deep breat-" Misha stopped, letting out a sigh, "Ugh, listen. I'm gonna cut the bullshit with you. The Council wants me to give you this spiel about liberation and freedom but that's all looks." The visibly confused occupants of the room raised their eyebrows, was this some kind of joke?\n\nMisha could see things were going south, "Listen, I, uh, it's just that..." Misha took a deep breath. "It's that, I cannot explain how this will work with just a premade speech. Anarchy is something you must enjoy for yourself, I have seen it first hand. I lived in a state where people were shot if they passed out from exhaustion. I have seen tyranny first hand and I was used to it, it hardly phased me at the time. Now, I have seen the alternative, I have seen true cooperation, and it's beautiful. You all can bring that to your commune, you can bring cooperation." Many glances were shared between the different parties, before they looked back to Misha, giving their nod of approval. "

He took a break from his own reflection to peek out of his window, sure enough, he could hear the rumble of the patrol vehicle in the distance.\n\nIt seemed pointless to the old man, why did they feel the need to pillage Russia in the name of their own military dictatorship when they could do it so much easier under the red banner? If the goal all along was to fool the masses into thinking this was anarchy, they had done well enough. This old general knew otherwise. He had spent enough years in the service to know when someone fought only for blood or expansion. That's all he saw in the eyes of the officer assigned to his district. A man who broke his chains just to put them on someone else. Vasiliy wondered how much longer this charade could go on, the people of Russia were many things, gullible, fractured, and brutish, but they certainly weren't stupid and would soon wise up to this act, or at least he hoped.

Shostakovich turned down the music to a soft ambiance and opened his mouth to address the dying city. He struggled to find the words to say, picking around his brain all he could find was music notes, he would scream a concerto of drums, the beating heart of Russia, if he could. He mused around until something shot from his mouth "We have done our best." He gulped. "This republic was founded on the future, a state of tomorrow. The bumps along the way are natural, it meant progress. We spoke for a world where Russia is not a state of barbarism, of fiefs and serfs, a new Russia is on the horizon..." Violins occupied the lull in his speech, "one way or another. I make my last plea to you, consider the path you are treading, are we sure that we are content being the world's savages? This is not the end, we can learn from this and do better." From outside, Shostakovich could see his aide, motioning him to leave.

Vadim had noticed the men come through town first one day as he had played in the field, coming and speaking with our local council. After a while, a few more men came with measuring devices and some sort of planner. He had learned to be suspicious of such government men whenever they came. They had only meant trouble in the past. Vadim shuddered as he remembered back to those days when Papa had been sent off to fight.\n\nSuch men were easy to spot. In a village of only 500, most everyone knew everyone. Yet, these men didn't look like the other ones. They wore blue coveralls instead of those green military coats, and they didn't seem interested in taking anybody away. In fact, all they seemed interested in was putting up these big wooden poles connected by the long black cables. Vadim was perplexed.\n\nStranger yet, on his way home, he saw more men in blue coveralls putting up this big box in the middle of town, and the entire town surrounding them as they tried to connect the black cables to the big box. Every seemed to watch in anticipation of something, but what that was, Vadim knew not.\n\nAll of the sudden, a click was heard as the cable connected to the box, everyone watched with bated breath as one of the men in blue coveralls picked up the phone. With just two words, it was as if he had set a firecracker off in the crowd. The townsfolk cheered and hugged each other as Vadim looked on, confused as to the meaning of the words. He twisted them around in his mouth and repeated them, as if to gain a better understanding."

He would never give the state credit but for what it was worth, they knew how to keep records. To his left, General Ivan Stepanov, his right, Mikhail Kilchichakov, and outside the room, demanding something be done about all the men sitting around, Androniy Mishuernko. There was some comedy to the situation, the key-members of the Security Council, the men responsible for the ascendancy of anarchism, pilfering around a college campus. It was very important to Yuri and Stepanov, but it didn't stop the two from seeing the humor in it.\n\n\"All that training worth while, Ivan? They ever teach you how to pillage a college in war school?" Stepanov only scoffed, continuing to go through the files before him. Galanskov chuckled to himself and continued to flick through the millions of papers occupying the cabinet.\n\n"Found something." Said Kilchichakov, producing a manila folder. On its cover was the proud symbol of the hammer and sickle. Stepanov took the document from Mikhail and flipped open to the first page. Curriculum of The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics it read, bold and spelled in capital letters. Stepanov handed the document to Galanskov who, at least, attempted to read each page diligently before Stepanov took the folder back.\n\n"You can read it on your own time, we have what we are looking for now. This along with all the other ones from the other college in this city should be more than enough for them to build an adequate curriculum."\n\n"Ivan, you're too quick to accept Soviet teachings, we can keep looking, I am sure we can find a curriculum here that suits the people's vision for the future" Galanskov said.\n\nStepanov shook his head and countered, "I hate them as much as you do, Yuri.

Such was the joys of leaving the Free Territory open to all. Everyone had their complaints, something they believed that the Security Council needed to handle. The necessity of the speeches were often dubious at best, but it was still their right to speak, even if no action came. Today was unlike the rest, more than just the usual two members of the Council were listening intently. General Stepanov leaned forward in his seat, wheels obviously turning in his head. Yuri Galanskov, similarly, was listening intently but he wasn't alone.\n\n"We didn't even do anything! We were just walking to the grocer and he...he stopped to look at something in a shop, the owner came out and he was just shouting. He called us evil and a disgusting bastardization of the Lord's image. It was just something dumb. The guy was selling flowers and well, he loves flowers. We run the largest garden in our commune actually. I'm sorry I am rambling."\n\nStepanov dropped his pen on his desk and shook his head. "I am not gonna force you to explain anymore. What happened to you is disgusting and should never happen to anyone in this free society." Yuri's, head swayed from side to side as he considered the traumatic experience. It was the couple's right to do as they pleased but it was also the right of the man to shout was it not? Yuri, usually overflowing with things to say, was usually silent.\n\nLuckily, Companion Valenteev spoke for him. "What happened to you is horrible, I could not wish that upon my own, however, I do believe it is firmly his right in this society to not only deny you service, but voice his opinion on your practices. Bickering quickly broke out between the members of the council, with most agreeing the shop owner was acting out of line, but the division spurring about whether it was his right to deny someone due to their sexuality.\n\nFinally, Stepanov commanded silence. "Companions, we must see this as not a lone issue, but a larger one that threatens to tear apart our Territory as a whole. I motion to make it a priority of this body that we end injustice on every level, even in personal.""

Mikhail cared very little for anarchism, even less so for Stepanov. Mikhail liked numbers, numbers made sense in a world where nothing did. Even if he had never read Bakunin or and only heard of Makhno in passing, Mikhail knew how to make things work and even Yuri had to admit it every now and then.\n\n"That's a lot of zeros on this figure here, Ivan." Mikhail said, peering over his glasses, "I am not gonna bore you with the ideological implications of your little anti-poverty, or shall I say, anti-Galanskov, proposal here. What's more important to me is how you want to bring this about when I am already differing a sizeable portion of our budget to keeping your boys stocked up with the most up to date guns money can buy."\n\nStepanov leaned forward, folding his hands on Mikhail's desk, "I assure you Companion Kilchichakov what I am offering is not only feasible but it is necessary! We ought to be actively redistributing the wealth to the people! Think of how many lives we could be saving and improving with this landmark agenda!"\n\nMikhail sighed and shook his head. "Cut the shit, Ivan. I am not Yuri, I am not gonna be swayed by the people's struggle or whatever you call that horseshit you just spouted at me. I'm looking at this from a solely pragmatic point of view, that's my job yeah? I balance the books, you shoot the reactionaries. I don't see why you are even here, the current system of communal self management works fine. They take the money they need and put it where they see fit, why do we even have to get involved in the whole process."\n\nStepanov scowled at Mikhail, visibly angry, but not willing to drop his act just yet, "It's important to not only myself Mikhail but to the army as well. Think about who's families this will save. Think about what they will think if the news breaks that Mikhail Kilchichakov shot down this agenda all the while accruing a not-so-small fortune."

He shivered in the Siberian frost, his multiple layers of clothing doing little to protect him from the cold. Despite the elements, or maybe because of them, Yuri frozen in his tracks. He breathed in the cool air of the city, the city he built, that he loved, the city where it all begin. He sauntered to the gate, so many engravings on it from so many expeditions. It began to set in with him, this was real. Him, Yuri Galanskov, was forging a new Russia hand and hand with his communal brothers. It felt so...final. There was no going back now, he had lead too many armies, too many had died. He must charge ahead at full speed now, inaction now would spell the death of the anarchist movement. Yuri pushed off from the gate and continued his walk to the General Assembly.\n\nThrowing open the doors, Yuri saw the usual suspects, Stepanov at his desk, writing something. Valenteev gesturing to a map decorated with cities labeled friendly and opposed and Mishuernko attempting to cross out all the ones labeled friendly. And hundreds of other people, chatting about the assembly hall. Yuri smiled to himself, they were a rag-tag bunch. He found that fitting for the torchbearers of anarchism, it ought to be a movement of many people from all backgrounds. Yuri shook hands with Valenteev and nodded in respect to Mishuernko before taking his seat on the bench.\n\n"Ladies and gentlemen, as the last of us trickle in on the chilly Siberian morning, I would like to say a few words before we begin." Galanskov stood in awe of the crowd, of the movement."What we have done here is what the nightmares of Tsars and fascists alike are made of! We have stood up, together! Through our loyalty to each other we have freed our people of the tyranny of the state, but much more is to come. We have a lot before us, I can tell you it won't be simple or enjoyable all the time. It will be hard. All good things in life are fought for, not handed to us. We have fought for freedom here but I cannot sleep at night, companions, knowing there is still so much work left to do."

She fiddled with the papers, smiling awkwardly to the security council, her pearly white teeth nearly blinding many of its members. Yuri gave her a nod and the blonde haired woman began speaking.\n\n"Good morning ladies and gentlemen of Kansk! My name is Sofia Petrova, I was a wealthy upstart from the city of Tomsk." She paused for a second, trying to gauge the audience reaction. "My life revolved around administering my father's business, caring for my two lovely girls, and expanding my knowledge with the night classes I'd attend. All three of which were taken from me." Sofia's smile flickered for just a second, like the flame of a candle being blown on. "I am not here to give you kind folks my sob story," the woman said, retrieving a silk handkerchief from her pocket and dabbing at her crystal blue eyes. "I'm here to say there is good in the world. That not everyone in that city was evil. I have wholeheartedly accepted that this is simply the way things go! You know?" The woman laughed a little too hard to the silent audience. Sofia, not missing a single beat, continued on. "I know you are angry and that you want justice, I want justice too, but I ask you show mercy in your justice. Tomsk was pillaged. We lost everything. We are willing to not only live within this land, but love it, we yearn to experience your brotherhood. My only caution," Sofia offered a pathetic half smile, "let the people build equality, don't thrust it upon them."\n\nSofia descended the podium, her head down as she returned to her seat. She crossed her legs and put on her biggest grin, she knew in some communes they would've shot her just for saying she administered a business.

The poor planning of Buhkarin and the power hungry generals, crumpling Russia up in their hands and scattering it into the wind often receive the blunt force trauma of the blame. What so many forget due to their unwavering commitment to God is the role of the Church. On surface level, one would be hard pressed to guess the church as the root of all evil, but it wouldn't be too far from the truth.\n\nBelieving in God is opposed to the anarchist mindset in and of itself. To be a servant of God is to be in doubt of the power of the individual above all else. Those who draft the different versions of the Bible take the chance to manipulate the people's will to their own. As the centuries have passed, the world of God, if it even existed has been twisted and mangled to the point it is hardly recognizable. A free land means freedom from all tools of the state, to which the church is just one of many.\n\nThat being said, the motion to confiscate the wealth of the church was one of brutal debate with the priest of Kansk engaging in a multiple hour long debate with Galanskov over the use of the church for good and for evil. In the end, the Security Council voted unanimously to handicap the church, de facto sealing them off from the General Assembly."

The questions clouded the young mans mind as he climbed up to the balcony of the Kansk City Hall. This city is where it all began, where he first protested against the Central Siberian Republic's hypocrisy, where he organized a revolt, where he developed a friendship with Ivan Stepanov, a man he would've disdained. He supposed that was the beauty of anarchy, he didn't know what would come next. He certainly knew would he would like to do, but would he ever achieve them? He was unsure. He had heard reports from both the east and west, neither were promising. In the middle of them both, was the Free Territory, the safe zone between the statists. They would most certainly send their planes and tanks, but what they would falter on is their message. A person will not become a fascist or a socialist if you shoot them long enough. What changes people is words, a uniquely human trait.\n\nGalanskov saw the thousands crowding the city square and he saw hope, a people who had seen enough suffering for their lifetime. They were going to decide the fate of Russia, the people before him, it was up to Yuri to help guide them towards good. "Companions! Those of you who are joining us for the first time and those who have followed us since the beginning, I welcome you." The people began to applaud, some chanting his name, something that didn't sit right with Yuri. Regardless, he continued on. "Today the greatest struggle to come to Russia enters its next stage. We will face enemies who wish to divide us, to subvert our agenda and substitute their own. They wish to manipulate us, to force us back under the boot we crawled out of.

Yuri smoothed out his suit and stretched, standing up from his seat. It was nice to have something to ground him in reality. He could barely believe how everything had changed, like a train barreling it's way down the tracks with the breaks cut. They had to run out of rail eventually right? One day the people would realize that killing everyone in a mob would not be the solution to their problems, surely. He wouldn't be the one to find out.\n\nYuri stepped off the train. Here he was. Biysk. Yuri looked around for any sign of civilization, he was the only one stepping off the train after all. He had been briefed that the city was a backwater, it was his job to do his best appraisal, see what was good as is, what could be improved, and what had to be scrapped entirely. Before the collapse of, well, everything, Yuri did the same job, just often accompanied by armed guards and motivated by a large pay. Now, he was alone, in anarchy, looking out at a bunch of sheep farmers, tasked with turning the city into a metropolis.\n\nYuri walked around the "city", if one could even call it that. For the most part the rural people of Biysk kept to themselves, which made gathering info difficult. He saw a bar in the distance, the only thing more common than the rail in Russia. Yuri walked in, set down his briefcase and began jotting down his notes. Abruptly, he felt a tap on his should.\n\n"Hey stranger, Who are you?" The barkeep asked.\n\nYuri cleared his throat before answering, "I'm just doing surveying the town! Just a little research for the eggheads in Novosibirkisk!" Yuri laughed awkwardly. Damn it, why was he being so awkward?\n\nThe woman smiled despite his nervous demeanor and said, "Well Yuri, I hope you say good things about us, we don't give the love we deserve." The woman winked and walked away, leaving a stunned and confused Yuri alone with his notes. He shook his head and looked back at the paper, but the words were blurred. He looked back at the barkeep, conversing with an elderly man. The two shared a hearty laugh. Yuri swallowed and picked up his pen again, writing a simple phrase."

He didn't hate where he lived, didn't like it either. Like most in Kemerovo, Danil was just trying to get by. He worked at the steel mill until six, he picked up his dinner, and returned home, ready to settle down for the night and do it all over again. He didn't care much for liberation this and people's justice or struggle or whatever the buzzword this week. "Hey, I appreciate it, but I'm ok. Thank you, enjoy the rest of your night."

Danil said, leaving the door open. The man took his chance, stepping in through the door, pamphlets in hand.

He couldn't attend there schools even if he wanted to, his family needed him on the farm. He was chief of feeding the horses! A very prestigious title, his mother assured him. Still, such an important title would only carry him so far in life, what he really needed was to learn how to read.\n\nShe pulled open the door, wished her son the best, and practically pushed him out into the Siberian wasteland.

In the days of the Tsar, some moaned and groaned as they got the privilege of being forced into it by their affluent parents. Imagine that today, a Russian fighting and cursing because he had to get an education. Most would kill a man just to know how to read. That was precisely the reason Nikolay did what he did, because he found people and their unending quest for knowledge fascinating. Even the most brutish Black Army solider had questions, that's what kept them human even as they gunned down their enemies.\n\nWhen the General Assembly made a general call for teachers or for those willing to become them, Nikolay rushed to answer which was precisely how he ended up in Kansk, the city transformed from the beating heart of the territory to just another city. Nikolay found the prospect of the city of the revolution being lost to history a terrifying one and noted he ought to make it one of the main subjects of his daily lesson.\n\n"Mr.Zholdin!" His pupils cried as he entered the room.\n\nThe humbled teacher wasted no time getting into the lesson, picking up the chalk and drawing a hammer and sickle on the board. "The hammer and sickle. The symbol of not only Bukharin, but of Yagoda. Separately, these tools mean nothing but when they are put together, what do they represent? They show the common tools of the worker, united. This sounds, on the surface level, like something we ought to rally behind. However," Nikolay paused for dramatic effect, prompting his students to look up from their notes and met eyes with their instructor, "This is a prime example of what we must be most aware of. The state will wear many clothes to try and trick you into being their puppet. There is only one symbol that represents freedom, that is the people hand in hand, nothing else.""

He shrugged, whatever, he had to walk past her desk anyways. Rising with a stretch, Valenteev snuggled the papers under his armpit and exited the room. Right away, he could already hear laughing. Not uncommon but certainly not normal for the office. Valenteev travelled down the hall and to the left, the voices of the lobby becoming audible. "See that? Scar. That's what you get from multiple campaigns. See, I shot a Red Army guy from three kilometers away, it was pretty impressive." On the desk, leaned a recruit, badgering a very bored and disinterested secretary. It was clear he had been at it for some time, with little fruits for his labor.\n\nValenteev sauntered up and plopped his papers on the counter. "Evening Companion, I heard you shot a guy from three meters away!" The distressed newbie began to stammer out some explanation but Valenteev only chuckled and held up a hand. "No, no, that is extremely impressive! Why don't you show this fine lady here some of your shooting prowess?" Valenteev unholstered his pistol and thrust it into the boys hands. "Here shoot me. Point blank." Valenteev stared deep into the boys eyes, his smile replaced by a scowl. For some time the boy stood there, shaking, before dropping the pistol to the ground. Valenteev retrieved the weapon and returned it to his belt. "That's what I thought. Listen kid, the army isn't a place to pick up girls, you have an obligation to defend your commune and nothing else. I was ready to lay down my life for a point, that's what every man and woman and the Black Army swears to do. If you can't do that, I advise packing your shit and leaving."

We have both watched too many young men die in the chaos of war. I brought you hear not to spar with you Androniy, but to lay the groundwork for generations long after us to continue the battle against the state." Valenteev gaged his contemporaries' reaction, finding it apparent that he wasn't making any progress. Valenteev, ever the strategist, tried a different approach. Pulling up a chair and sitting in front of him, he met eyes with the old man. "Neither of us will leave until we solidify a doctrine for warfare going forwards. I will write down on this paper one thing I deem essential, and then you will do the same. Once we have our list assembled, we can each cross off one of each other's points." Valenteev started, writing down the necessity for autonomy for the officers. Mishuerkno eyed the paper with suspicion, but eventually relented, jotting down his claim that air support was a must have.

He observed himself in the mirror adjacent to the entrance to his dacha. He grabbed at the fat on his fat, pulling at it. He dropped his shoulders. He was getting far too old for this. How long had he been fighting? How long had he been acting? How long was he going to wait? The general shook the thoughts from his head, it was a long game worth playing, nobody who ever rushed to power stayed in. As he walked to his bathroom he let out a groan, his knees were giving out on him, too little years spent charging into battle and far too many spent planning them. Ivan turned on the faucet, still hung up on the conundrum that had plagued him for years. On the other hand, those who waited for power did not get long to enjoy it. Stepanov cupped the cool water in his hands and brought it to his face.\n\nThree knocks came from the door. Stepanov sighed, letting his head lean against the wall. What could it be now? Begrudgingly, Stepanov returned to the door and answered it. Before him stood exactly what he pictured, a scruffy kid. Was it so much to ask for just for people to act like people? "What do you need?"\n\n"Good evening Companion Galanskov, I apologize for my tardiness, I just enlisted! I came from out east, still getting myself acquainted" Stepanov raised an eyebrow to the man, he knew naivety, he could see it from kilometers away, taste it in the air. He loved it. The recruit let out a nervous chuckle to fill the awkward silence. "I had a message for you from Companion Valenteev. He told me to tell you he would have radioed in himself but their only one broke in the middle of their expedition. They have orders to go Tatarsk but-"\n\n"They have orders to go to Lesosibirsk, that's what I told Valenteev." Stepanov interjected. "I am very tired, it's late. You have your orders. Run along now." Stepanov quickly slammed the door on the soliders face. Well, he thought, maybe it would all pay off in the end."

 KHA.87.desc:0 ""I trust you retrieved the information I requested?"\n\nMarko just returned from Novosibirsk, from civilization, finally back to the cold and somber wilderness. He was honoured to be chosen to serve under Companion Valenteev, even in the frozen huts of the far east, he had heard the stories. Valenteev was uncompromising but passionate, not just bitter like the assholes where he came from. He fought for what he believed in, that was something Marko could look up to in a commander. He was not only willing, but eager, to lay down his life for Valenteev, for his commune. God it felt so good just to have a purpose. Marko did not see combat however, he saw his companions set up tents as he climbed in the truck. He had never met Companion Galanskov but his name was unavoidable. When Dimitri gave him the address of the commander of the Black Army, he felt giddy to meet Companion Galanskov, but found him irritable.\n\n"Of course, Companion Valenteev. We are under orders from Companion Galanskov to go straight to Lesosibirsk."\n\nValenteev furrowed his brow, "Seriously? That's what he said? Well then," Stepanov took the googles from his forehead and pulled them down over his face."Let's go."\n\nArriving in the commune of Lesosibirsk, Marko could immediately sense something was amiss, the way people poured out of their houses, standing outside and just...staring. Valenteev was visibly uncomfortable. He spoke to one of the members of the commune, something Marko couldn't really hear. He tried to claw his way to the front of the pack to stand next to Companion Valenteev. Why had they sent so many people? By the time he reached his commander, there was shouting. Whomever Valenteev was speaking to had drawn his weapon. The people on their front lawns holstered weapons of all kinds as well, shotguns, rocks, bottles, whatever. Valenteev began to back away, but the crowd was too rowdy. Someone, in the crowd of Black Army soldiers, or from the commune fired. Markno knew he had to act and charged forward, slamming Valenteev to the ground."

Candles adorned the shelves of the walls, giving the room a golden glow, sat nestled awkwardly between the antiques and nick-nacks that occupied the space the other 364 days of the year. The beating heart of the room was found at the center, a wall of men surrounding him, hanging on to his every word. Yuri Galanskov's booming voice was unmistakable.\n\n"So I have Kilchichakov standing beside me, reeks like dead deer and alcohol, I'm trying to not puke up that morning's food, although it would've looked the same as it did as when I ate it when it came out! Am I right? I know you've seen that stuff! Anyways, he's trying to tell me, he says, 'Yuri, I think I hit a deer on the way here.' and I turn to him and say, keep in mind he stinks like death itself, and I say 'Oh no! That was just Mishuernko wandering out of the mental facility again!'" The table exploded into laughter, save for the man at the head of the table who's mind was fixated on the drink before him.\n\nSuddenly, the door to the tavern threw itself open. "Companions! Companions! Where is Yuri?!"\n\nGalanskov pushed his chair back and stood, his demeanor quickly shifting from jovial to serious. "What is it? I am here."\n\n"I don't know. I don't know! I just, I just was out hunting, out northwards you know? I saw the Black Army, t-they were just all in this massive formation in the city square. I didn't think much of it and continued on my way, but I heard shots and men stared falling!"

However, life, time, are such a fragile concepts. Mistakes made are seldom offered re-do's. This leads to many sitting on their hands their whole lives, planning, but never acting. "Before you, I have made copies of memorandum 91703. This message, relayed from Mr. Galanskov-"\n\n"You'll stop right there Ivan. I've given far too much," Some men, in contrast, put too much into life. Devoting their entire life to a belief they not only find just, but essential. "To sit here and have you badger me!

I know exactly what this is!" Galanskov bellowed from his seat.\n\nStepanov carried on, undisturbed. "The message before you never got to Companion Valenteev. So Valenteev sends a messenger. Mr. Galanskov tells the messenger that Valenteev is required in Lesosibirsk. He repeats this multiple times. They must go to Lesosibirsk. And so they do. While there, fighting broke out between the local population and the confused regiment. Eight dead. Countless wounded." The room was silent, but if looks could talk, the room would be unbearably loud. Galanskov held his head high, eye level with the people, his brothers and sisters, who had come out in droves to support him. He reminded himself to not look at the seemingly increasing number of soldiers in the room as well. "Before us, we have a hot headed child, not someone fit to lead us into the greatest struggle we will ever face. I cannot, in good faith, allow Mr. Galanskov to guide the most important of battles. I beg this body to put the people first and remove Mr. Galanskov immediately." The members of the Security Council shared nervous glances between each other, there was not one "peopl", as Stepanov referred too. The Free Territory had instead split between two increasingly threatening camps; the people and the army."

He would either die accompanied with his closest allies for something they believed in, for something good! If not, he would be there when Russia as a whole was liberated from the state. Somewhere deep within his heart, somewhere where even he could not find it, what Yuri wanted nothing more was to die free, to not share the same fate as his father or his father before him. Siberia was cold and unforgiving, it was something he learned at a young age and kept with him all his life. It was a place that cared little for want or wishes. Siberia delivered.\n\nGalanskov, the caged anarchist, paced around in the back of the transport vehicle. Shackles followed him, rattling, reminding him he was enslaved, taunting him, their metallic jingle a cruel laugh. How funny. An anarchist locked in a box. Very funny indeed Ivan. Yuri was often called an annoyance by his contemporaries, he didn't see it that way. He saw through their posturing. They were scared. Scared of what he had accomplished, something that he had set in motion, even if he would rot in prison, his message had been made and the world would never be the same. However, if his reputation was an annoyance, might as well live up to that. He pounded on the glass separating the rear of the vehicle.\n\nIn response to Yuri's commotion, the driver simply turned on the radio. Playing was some sort of announcement from Stepanov. "Companions of the Free Territory! Today, my heart breaks. We have already experienced a turbulent preceding days and further tragedy has befallen our people. The transport vehicle of Yuri Galanskov, while traveling from Novosibirsk to Kansk, was lost." Yuri's heart stopped. "I do not have all the answers, but I am committed to living up to the legacy of our honoured companion." Realization began to set in, prompting Yuri to scream and continue to pound on the divider between himself and the driver. Between himsef and death."

It's supposed to be inspirational, it's supposed to give a lazy bum the kick in back to do what they were always afraid of. Stepanov wasn't quite sure if he was afraid of the people. There was no confusion, he certainly didn't like them, but was he afraid of them? Did he hate them? That question was more nuanced, and certainly not the one General Ivan Stepanov pictured he'd be thinking as men and women alike kicked at his ribs.\n\nHe couldn't hear much, maybe because his head had been savagely beaten, maybe because he didn't want to. Stepanov built his head like a fortress, locking himself in and others out. For decades, that was how he lived, a constant inner monologue with himself, planning his eventual assault from the fortress. The moment he let the drawbridge down to charge is the moment his castle crumbled. He had waited so long. Put up with so much "companion" this and "stateless" that. Who gave a fuck? He certainly didn't. All that preparation all to hear the Security Council utter those simple words. Yet, the only thing Stepanov heard were the chants of the raging crowd before him.\n\nStepanov the general died in the Security Council. Stepanov the schemer died as the people saw through his act. Stepanov the bloody and broken would die at their hands. Galanskov was saying something, of course he was, but Stepanov didn't care to listen. He chose to watch. Watch as his men anxiously hovered their hands over their guns, looking at each other for support. Shoot! He screamed at them through his eyes, do something! He felt the rope slither around his neck. His eyes softened, a command to a plea, a plea to scream and a scream to nothing."

 KHA_LibSoc.1.desc:0 "Somewhere, deep in the woodlands of Siberia, Yuri Galanskov wandered. He trembled, his naked body recoiling against the falling snow. He was stripped off all his possessions save for a singular lantern, radiating a dim light. Above him, a pale white eye watched him from a black, starless, sky. Without direction or purpose, Yuri stumbled forwards. The forlorn forest swayed in the frigid wind but Yuri's hair remained still. The air sung a song, a call. It was inviting! It felt like home! It felt...good. The shaking stopped. Suddenly, he existed outside of the elements. Snowflakes made their home on his skin, refusing to melt. This was good! He laughed as he dropped the lantern. Yuri kicked snow into the air and danced around as the ice crystals fell to the ground ever so delicately. He spun and twisted and jumped, frolicking deeper and deeper in the woods. The song of the forest grew louder and louder as Yuri's grin grew larger and larger.\n\nThe song stopped. The great celestial body watching over him blinked out of existence. The forest was now black. It was more than black, it was a void. It wasn't simply a room with dull light, it was the destroyer of light. Yuri's laughing trailed off as the cold impacted him once more. For years, Yuri stood in the destroyer of light. Without warning, the trees ignited into flame. Yuri began to scream, he began to claw at his skin. It was so hot! Too hot! Its hot! Yuri began to melt, his skin pooling at the ground. Its hot. its hot. hot hot.\n\nFrom the ashen corpse of the woods, a single tree grew and on its lone branch dangled a body. Fat and round, the body shook amongst the flicking flames. "Yuri." The corpse thundered, "You child. Look what you have brought to this forest. Teeming with life. Now look! LOOK!" Yuri had no eyes to look but he saw.\n\nYuri jerked himself upright in his bed, panting heavily. He looked around his room, as it was before he closed his eyes. He began to laugh, it was only a dream! His giggle turned into a laugh and his laugh into a sob."

The revolutionary looked straight on, his mind elsewhere. Yevgeniya circled from his back and stood in front of him. She strained to find Yuri inside of his eyes. Her face dropped. "Yuri? I understand you're torn" She placed her wrinkled hands on his chest. "We've come too far now. You have to speak to them, I know you will. You will always do the right thing, Yuri. You aren't him." The phrase struck a chord with Yuri, his face twitching slightly.\n\n"Thank you, Companion Taratuta." Yuri pulled the coat tighter around himself as he moved for the door to the balcony. Yuri gripped the doorknob, before he even stepped out, Yuri could hear their cheers. They sung his name, demanding to see Companion Galanskov, defender of the revolution against the snake general, Stepanov. Yuri took in a deep breath, turned the knob, and stepped out into the brisk morning air.\n\nYuri nodded politely as he waited for the roaring applause to end. It felt different. This was the treatment fascists received and Tsars envied. Why was he here? The answer was in the admiration of the people below him. They chose him. They trusted him. Yuri was not to let them down.\n\n"Companions!" He called, "Today we pass the second test! With our combined might, we toppled the authoritarian states of Siberia! We have left them battered and bruised, yet, we must remain vigilant. It is time to build our own anarchy, free from the state inside and out of our territory!" Yuri found his footing, continuing to rally the people to his side as he laid out the core message of the anarchist movement. If for only a moment, the weight of the fear lifted from his shoulders."

The executioner must have lost his balance while aiming. The bullet lodged itself neatly in his chest. Against his best judgement and his own personal will, he screamed.

Whether it is statists and fascists, or anarchists themselves, it seems that we must kill the vanguards of a state to achieve lasting anarchy. And I was considering this unfortunate conclusion when I realized it was not from the loins of death that anarchy emerges, but from the fear of death.

In Anarchy Square, a small crowd was gathered. Usually, Anarchy Square was home to the occasional snake oil tradesman or men on the political fringe, the homeless and the mad. This time, some combination of all of the former was on stage. As Ivan Stepanov stepped up to the microphone, the scaffolding below him creaked.\n\n"The tyrant, Yuri Galanskov, has died in imprisonment!"\n\nThe crowd murmured and shuffled. Stepanov had accepted a warmer reception.\n\n"I have brought together leaders of the many congresses of Siberia together to discuss the march of Anarchy past the legacy of Galanskov. With the Black Army's guiding hand, I will insure Novosibirsk and beyond the promise of liberty!

It would take a while to truly snuff that spirit of rebellion. Once he was finished, community leaders stepped forward to the podium. Their words were triumphant and proud, yet the tone underneath was fearful. Politicians were great actors only when a gun wasn't pointed at their sorry heads.

The snowpack had meant that the doors were shut tight, and half a day of digging by hand was required just to clear the way. Much of the town slipped through, huddled together, and began discussing the issue of the day.\n\nThe harvest had been poor that fall, and some families up north didn't have enough food to last the winter. A larger farm to the south of the hamlet was saving food for any Black Army patrols that passed through the town, but after realizing how dire the situation was decided to set aside most of it for the family.\n\nThe exact deal was hashed out, handshakes were made, and everybody got plenty drunk. After all, the night was cold and the vodka was warm. It began to feel like a party. Someone even brought a balalaika, and just as everybody began to dance, a shot rang out. Not a mile out, some hunter far from the forest, but in the barn. A man held the gun above his head, and as everyone figured out who exactly shot it, they finally realized who that new citizen was. Not a citizen - not even a local. By the accent he drunkenly spoke in, he was from Novosibirsk. To frightened ears, he was able to slur out a few words.\n\n"No-one will be, ah - sharing food - without express permission from the Black Army.

Instead of arguing for further economic measures, they argued for political freedom. It was the first time they had to do so, being given total freedom before Stepanov came to power. Now, all across Siberia, theft took place and freedoms were curtailed. In the north, valuable timber was floated down the river for firewood on the front. Horses and tractors were seized; they were needed for efforts "to develop the region". The best wheat in the south was taken in the south for soldier's rations. Some outspoken communal leaders began to disappear. It seemed that all that the Black Army had been founded on was gone in a scant few months. Freedom was no longer free.\n\nThat is not to say that the Black Army was about to fire on a group of peaceful protestors. Stepanov was statist, not stupid. For now, he could watch as resistance simply faded out and the Black Army began to show the people what freedom really cost. No longer could they sit idly and fail to contribute to freeing Russia.

It started out with a few blazes of light, but within a few minutes it had begun to vibrate and jostle with fantastic color. Green, purple, blue, lighting up the sky. Like some great indescribable dance.\n\n"Oh, my god. They don't have this in the south.""

 KHA_Despotist.15.desc:0 "The new Novosibirsk technical school had been nothing but trouble. The schooling was leaving kids with no idea how to do anything technical, and it seemed that the teachers were all subversives educating their pupils on nothing but anarchist revolutionary thought. Some of the students had recently been getting drunk and running an organization called the "New Anarchists", proclaiming their hatred for the Security Council and their wish for a return to Yuri's idealism.\n\nIt was on one freezing night in Novosibirsk when a band of the New Anarchists staged a "protest" on the street. They yelled drunken slurs at passing soldiers and threw loose bricks and rocks from the cobblestone. A crowd began to build up, of curious spectators and disgruntled soldiers. It seemed as if this was about to turn into a one-sided fight, a Boston Massacre for a new Russia. Which new Paul Revere would depict it, famously? Which Crispus Attucks would lead the charge for freedom and Anarchy?\n\nA soldier pulled out a rusty revolver and shot it in the air three times. Perhaps the bravery of these anarchists had been overstated. Upon hearing the gunshots, they scrambled to run."

 KHA_Despotist.16.desc:0 "It felt good to win. It felt good to be himself. It felt good to relax and unwind, simply sipping the most luxury alcohol Russia had to offer. Looking out from his balcony, Ivan Stepanov saw Russia, HIS Russia. Of course it 'belonged to the people', anarchy was alive and well. A matter of fact, anarchy had never been stronger! Stepanov nearly spat out his wine in laughter.\n\nHe was out there somewhere, in a shallow grave, buried in the place he loved. Poetic. Stepanov should try poetry maybe! If only he had the time in between managing people and the military. He might write down his ideas one day, who knows? A better question, who cares? Stepanov certainly didn't. This night was his alone. No Yuri to pester him with ideology, no Valenteev to threaten his rule, and no guilt to haunt him.\n\nGeneral Ivan Stepanov carefully selected a record off his shelf and put it under the needle. The sun began to set over Siberia, casting a golden light on the treacherous general. Was it worth it? To put up with all the nonsense of Companion this and that? To slaughter men in the name of an ideology he couldn't care less for? Most definitely.\n\nStepanov sat in his reclining chair, there would be issues: the impending liberation, the growing Black Army, weeding out the last holdouts of Yuri's supporters. Those were issues for tomorrow. Tonight belonged to him, Russia belonged to him, the most brilliant thief, the one who stole the anarchist movement out from underneath them."

They were drinking and stripping; it was a normal night. That was, until she said those words.\n\n"Oh yeah, totally nuked the trees."\n\nOne of the prettier whores, with bright red lipstick and a short skirt that Stepanov had personally requested.\n\n"Wait. Aleksadrina, was it? No. Karine. What did you just say?"\n\n"I- I just said I had to cut down these trees outside of my place. One of them was going to fall. I didn't mean any offense, Mr. Stepanov. And - it's Anastasia, sir."\n\n"No. Karine, you used a very specific word to describe you cutting down those trees."\n\n"Nuked?"\n\n"Yes. Yes, that's it! That's it!"\n\nThe Siberian hookers looked in awe as Stepanov jaunted out of the dacha, hopped into his car, and drove south. Well, he had paid them for the night and there was alcohol, why not party a little longer?\n\nStepanov was a little drunk, but it was clear. He needed a nuclear bomb. It was the only way. At this stage, who wouldn't invade them? Without that great deterrent which kept the rest of the world in a stasis, it would already be engulfed in war."

 KHA_Despotist.18.desc:0 "Yuri Galanskov sat alone with a glass of vodka and tapped his foot. Deep in thought, he continued tapping until he realized the thump he was making. Forcing himself to breath and slow down, he realized what must be done.\n\nThe Black Army had become rulers, and if there was anything Yuri hated more than the state, it was the rulers that upheld the state that deserved to be punished. When a people's army loses its ideals and the support of it's people it simply becomes a group of bandits, and Galanskov was sad to admit that that is what it had become. Who knew what they were plotting? To overthrow the anarchy, the freedom that they had fought so hard for? Restore some state rooted in the ideas of communism but so devoid of the actual ideals it represents? It must end. They must be killed. And if they couldn't be killed, worked nearly to death.\n\nThe reprisals started out small. Communes recalling soldiers or generals under "suggestion" from Yuri. A few in the lower ranks disappeared into the north. By the end of the month, the writing was on the wall. So many men simply gone. Officially, many had simply never existed, wiped off the record. But it was an open secret where they were. Either lost to an eternal dreamless sleep, or toiling in camps up north. Life was brutal and often short in those camps. Men arrived in tears, begging for some other punishment, something else. But Galanskov had enough with tyrants. He'd had enough with the people being little more than slaves of bandits. The Black Army must be cleansed."

Who else in their right mind would take a man like him - someone fighting for the white race, for the integrity of the Aryan people - and make him mine for some god-forsaken metal? They were pulling the strings on it all. The fucking Jews.\n\nArtur tried to determine what the smell in the mine was. Sickly, almost. But when he inhaled the air, his throat filled with thick, choking dust. He could hardly breath. God, why hadn't he fought the Jews to the death? He had killed one, he thought, but now that he thought back to it, that might have been one of his own men. The rifles. They were made my Jews, they had faulty triggers. And now what, they were making a nuclear bomb? No shit, considering atoms were a Jewish science. He had to get back to Germania. He had to warn Hitler. Was Hitler even alive anymore? Oh my god, he couldn't breathe. He had to get back to Hitler. Get out of the mine, tell him they were building a bomb. The Jews. Yes, that was it. They were building a bomb. Artur clawed his way back to the sunlight. It was that direction, wasn't it? He thought he had taken a left there... maybe it was right? Yes, there it is. The sunlight. They made these mines so dusty and dark and confusing. Maybe it was the dust. He just couldn't get the dust out.\n\nThe guard watched as a man stumbled out of the mine, wheezing and mumbling. He just kept coughing out dust.\n\n"Get back in there, fascist scum! Your workday isn't over yet!"\n\nThe man stared back and started murmuring. "You're a Jew." He crawled up to the guard. "Why the fuck are you sons of Zion building the bomb? Why? Answer me!" The man stopped to wheeze.\n\n"Touch me and I'll shoot, Nazi."\n\nArtur limply punched the guard, and in one shot to the chest his life was gone."

For Stepanov, it was one of his peaks. Parading the bomb through Novosibirsk - even if it was just a dummy - proved to be a truly prideful moment for Stepanov. After the large papier mache bomb was driven through Novosibirsk, he stood up on a podium in Anarchy Square and began speaking to a cold and thoroughly bored crowd.\n\n"I wanted to thank all of the nuclear scientists that aided in the development of this technological marvel and have come here to witness it's display."\n\nNone of the scientists had shown up, but a light smattering of applause did begin. Stepanov continued. "This bomb will not only ensure our freedom, but will let our advanced capabilities be known to the entire world!"\n\nDick closed the newspaper. What a strange speech from Russia.

Unfortunately the original fool happened to be a sweet-talker, and so we are left with a world full of them. One particular type of fool which I despise the most is those that have faith in human nature. There is one thing to have faith in, and that is God. Not some myth of a pure man, or socialism, but the unity of god. And it seems that it is that faith that has led us to traitors, false shepherds like our old friend Galanskov.\n\nMen of Novosibirsk, do not follow in the footsteps of these men. Human nature is a terrible, terrible thing. Anarchy is nasty, brutish, and short. Only the leadership of a strongman may stop man from descending into war of all against all. I implore you, men of little faith, to rest that faith in me. For The Black Army will never stop to descend you from the tides of wild, ravaging savages. We are the new bastion of civilization in Siberia, and there is no one who will take that title away from us.""

 KHA_Despotist.22.desc:0 "The last real propaganda that Fyodor had seen were ones from the Bukharin days. Those damn posters, proclaiming the imminent defeat of the Germans and the triumphant Red Army marching forward. They used to be everywhere, plastered on every wall, smashed between every door. Now, they fluttered in the streets, stuck on trees or burned for warmth. Those unlucky enough to be stuck outside for the night stacked them on as blankets against the Siberian night. Fyodor reminisced to the days when a few unlucky posters ended up as toilet paper. They supposed that it was better than leaves.\n\nIt was strange, then, to see a new poster in Novosibirsk. This was not in the crisp red that Bukharin's poster had. With a closer look, Fyodor could see the imperfections in the printing. Color bled over lines, figures in the background were hardly more than black smudges. It was crude, but nevertheless a propaganda poster. What it depicted was strange. In the center was a man on his knees, bowing his head forward. The tattered cavalryman's uniform and wide handlebar mustache revealed the man's identity; Semyon Budyonny, that Bolshevik killed during the charge on Bratsk. With a sword to his throat was another man whose face wasn't revealed, but he had the build of a typical Black Army soldier. Squinting at the details, Fyodor could not make out the man's identity.\n\nFyodor has been there, at the charge. The high water of the Black Army's fight against the Bolshevik's to the east. Firing his old bolt-action at those horses. Budyonny headed the charge, and he was thrown off his horse when a stray bullet hit the brute's torso. As the Black Army beat off the Reds. At the end of it all, Galanskov shot Budyonny in the head. The news carried throughout the region. The devil of Bratsk was dead. Why then, Pyodor thought, was some anonymous soldier executing Budyonny, and not Yuri? It took a moment, but it dawned on Pyodor. Stepanov, that old bastard, wasn't trying to trumpet Yuri's achievements. He was trying to trumpet's the Black Army's. No better than Bukharin"
