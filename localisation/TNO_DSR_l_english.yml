 DSR.2.t:0 "The Radicals Achieve Victory!"
 DSR.2.desc:0 "Today, the news media around the world reported what seemed to be the most unlikely headline in recent history - Fascist Germany, and their World Capital, upended by Communists. Once a desperate breakaway of radicals from Speer's faction, the socialistic radicals eventually fought and defeated all of Hitler's successors, and eventually Speidel as well. As flags of the proclaimed Deutschland Sozialist Republik were planted on crumbled dustpiles of rubble, provisional Chairwoman Ulrike Meinhof entered Germania, or at least what was left of it, in great stride. Surrounded by only a couple of armed militiamen, Meinhof gave a speech in front of the still-burning Volkshalle to television cameras from news stations around the world announcing how 'a worldwide revolution' had begun. In her speech, attended in person by only some couple hundred malnourished Germanian citizens, she declared the founding of a new way of German life, free from the evil claws of fascism and capitalism. Even as anarchy reigned throughout the Reich, Meinhof's tone was optimisitc - a new freedom of man, she proclaimed.\n\nInternationally the response was mixed. Puppet-states still loyal to the Reich declared 'final struggles' against Communism while some moved around military assets as a show of force. But for most of the world, the reaction is a quiet one, anxious powers waiting to see what will become of the smouldering ruins that is Germany."
 DSR.2.a:0 "The Arbeiterklasse have triumphed!"

 DSR.3.t:0 "The Last Fascists"
 DSR.3.desc:0 "For years, Germany, the great Deutschland, has suffered at the hands of the brutal National 'Socialists', and now we suffer our punishment for ever believing in such an ideology. Civil war has destroyed the land, decimated the men, and starved the children, and Speer, the damned fool, did nothing to stop it. Now, we have taken control, now, Speer has been defeated, and is now off somewhere away from the place which he bloodied. The damn monster. And now, after so much more death, Germany is in our hands.\n\nAlmost.\n\nThe last vestiges of the Reich still hold out against the Red tide. One of the last fascists, Hans Speidel, still remains in Germania, the sick, twisted reimagining of Berlin. And although Germania has been relatively untouched by this wreck of a nation, it may be destroyed in the final battle for it. We will ask Speidel to surrender, to allow us to enter into Germania peacefully. Perhaps, if he sees the might of the workers, if he sees our army, then he will let us in!"
 DSR.3.a:0 "There is no possible way he can refuse!"

 DSR.4.t:0 "Speidel Refuses"
 DSR.4.desc:0 "When we approached the gates of Speidel's 'Welthauptstadt', we offered them to surrender so that at the very least, their capital wouldn't be destroyed against the army of the workers. Yet it appears fascists are in no mood to surrender. Although we have not even recieved a response to our request, we have recieved reports of Germanian guards firing on our forces and skimrishes being launched. From these actions, it is clear what the response is, and we must take action to destroy the last bastion of this Reich so that all can be free. Even if the precious Nazi 'world capital' is destroyed, we will not have any problems with it. Down with the fascists! Down with the capitalist pigs! Germany is ours!"
 DSR.4.a:0 "Oh well."

 DSR.101.t:0 "Autumn in Germany"
 DSR.101.desc:0 "As the days grow long and the winds grow stronger, so too does Germany change. With the victory of the DSR in the civil war slowly cementing itself as fact, public shock, anger, fear, and terror has slowly subsided into a cold, solitary note of existence-Germany at large unable to come to grips with their new reality. Labor crews and chain gangs continue the slow process of denazifying the nation, house by house, building by building, person by person. Lines for bread shorten and vagrants disappear from street corners, but not for any increase in food or jobs. No, while the winds of change blow in, they do so with a certain sharpness.\n\nThe council calls a meeting on a cloudless night to discuss their most pressing issuing. Their arguing simmers, before swelling into violent cacophony, the sounds of physical altercations and occasional gunfire punctuating growing rage. Guards posted outside alternate between repelling public nuisances (some armed, some peaceful), and arguing about whether to intervene. The moon rises and sets, and it's only when the sun begins to peak over the horizon that a beleaguered council exits, two fewer than when they entered.\n\nAutumn has arrived in Germany, and it's only a few short months before winter too envelops the nation."
 DSR.101.a:0 "And so it goes."

 POLITICS_ULRIKE_MEINHOF_DESC:0 "구시대의 잿더미에서 붉은 국가가 솟아납니다. 한때 학생 조직원이자 슈페어의 가장 열정적이고 헌신적인 지지자였던 울리케 마인호프는 그녀의 옛 이상에 적대적으로 변했고, 학생 민병대가 그토록 열심히 싸워왔던 모든 것을 파괴해버렸습니다.\n\n그녀는 불길과 분노를 연설합니다. 슈페어가 누구입니까? 그 남자는 대의를 지지한 적이 없습니다. 날이 갈수록 이 사실은 분명해졌습니다. 반란군이 목표를 달성하지 못하게 막은 부르군트 사람입니까? 그 자는 학도병과 수많은 목소리에도 불구하고 할 수 있는 만큼 최선을 다해 싸우지 않았습니다.\n\n그 자의 동기는 무엇입니까? 라이히에서 자유주의는 무엇입니까? 나치즘에서 벗어나 흑막에서 한 남자가 이끄는 자유주의는 무엇입니까? 자유주의가 독일 노예제국같은 악에 굴복하면 무슨 소용이 있겠습니까? 어떻게 회색분자가 어둠과 싸우겠습니까? 진정한 투쟁을 위해서라면 가능한 한 멀리 떨어진 곳에서 발포해야 합니다. 적들의 이상을 결코 모방할 수 없습니다.\n\n공산주의, 사회주의, 볼셰비즘. 나치가 뭐라고 하던 간에, 많은 독일인들은 그것이 무엇을 의미하는지 전혀 모르고 자랐습니다. 하지만 마인호프는 달랐고, 가장 중요한 한 가지를 알고 있었습니다. 그것이 무엇이던 간에, 나치즘과는 상상 이상으로 다릅니다.\n\n악을 완전히 물리치기 위해서는 악이 두려워하는 존재가 되어야 합니다. 마인호프는 자신을 인민의 해방자이자 라이히가 강요한 사슬을 끊을 사람, 나치의 안뜰에 숨어있는 괴물로 여깁니다."
