 DSR.2.t:0 "The Radicals Achieve Victory!"
 DSR.2.desc:0 "Today, the news media around the world reported what seemed to be the most unlikely headline in recent history - Fascist Germany, and their World Capital, upended by Communists. Once a desperate breakaway of radicals from Speer's faction, the socialistic radicals eventually fought and defeated all of Hitler's successors, and eventually Speidel as well. As flags of the proclaimed Deutschland Sozialist Republik were planted on crumbled dustpiles of rubble, provisional Chairwoman Ulrike Meinhof entered Germania, or at least what was left of it, in great stride. Surrounded by only a couple of armed militiamen, Meinhof gave a speech in front of the still-burning Volkshalle to television cameras from news stations around the world announcing how 'a worldwide revolution' had begun. In her speech, attended in person by only some couple hundred malnourished Germanian citizens, she declared the founding of a new way of German life, free from the evil claws of fascism and capitalism. Even as anarchy reigned throughout the Reich, Meinhof's tone was optimisitc - a new freedom of man, she proclaimed.\n\nInternationally the response was mixed. Puppet-states still loyal to the Reich declared 'final struggles' against Communism while some moved around military assets as a show of force. But for most of the world, the reaction is a quiet one, anxious powers waiting to see what will become of the smouldering ruins that is Germany."
 DSR.2.a:0 "The Arbeiterklasse have triumphed!"

 DSR.3.t:0 "The Last Fascists"
 DSR.3.desc:0 "For years, Germany, the great Deutschland, has suffered at the hands of the brutal National 'Socialists', and now we suffer our punishment for ever believing in such an ideology. Civil war has destroyed the land, decimated the men, and starved the children, and Speer, the damned fool, did nothing to stop it. Now, we have taken control, now, Speer has been defeated, and is now off somewhere away from the place which he bloodied. The damn monster. And now, after so much more death, Germany is in our hands.\n\nAlmost.\n\nThe last vestiges of the Reich still hold out against the Red tide. One of the last fascists, Hans Speidel, still remains in Germania, the sick, twisted reimagining of Berlin. And although Germania has been relatively untouched by this wreck of a nation, it may be destroyed in the final battle for it. We will ask Speidel to surrender, to allow us to enter into Germania peacefully. Perhaps, if he sees the might of the workers, if he sees our army, then he will let us in!"
 DSR.3.a:0 "There is no possible way he can refuse!"

 DSR.4.t:0 "Speidel Refuses"
 DSR.4.desc:0 "When we approached the gates of Speidel's 'Welthauptstadt', we offered them to surrender so that at the very least, their capital wouldn't be destroyed against the army of the workers. Yet it appears fascists are in no mood to surrender. Although we have not even recieved a response to our request, we have recieved reports of Germanian guards firing on our forces and skimrishes being launched. From these actions, it is clear what the response is, and we must take action to destroy the last bastion of this Reich so that all can be free. Even if the precious Nazi 'world capital' is destroyed, we will not have any problems with it. Down with the fascists! Down with the capitalist pigs! Germany is ours!"
 DSR.4.a:0 "Oh well."

 DSR.101.t:0 "Autumn in Germany"
 DSR.101.desc:0 "As the days grow long and the winds grow stronger, so too does Germany change. With the victory of the DSR in the civil war slowly cementing itself as fact, public shock, anger, fear, and terror has slowly subsided into a cold, solitary note of existence-Germany at large unable to come to grips with their new reality. Labor crews and chain gangs continue the slow process of denazifying the nation, house by house, building by building, person by person. Lines for bread shorten and vagrants disappear from street corners, but not for any increase in food or jobs. No, while the winds of change blow in, they do so with a certain sharpness.\n\nThe council calls a meeting on a cloudless night to discuss their most pressing issuing. Their arguing simmers, before swelling into violent cacophony, the sounds of physical altercations and occasional gunfire punctuating growing rage. Guards posted outside alternate between repelling public nuisances (some armed, some peaceful), and arguing about whether to intervene. The moon rises and sets, and it's only when the sun begins to peak over the horizon that a beleaguered council exits, two fewer than when they entered.\n\nAutumn has arrived in Germany, and it's only a few short months before winter too envelops the nation."
 DSR.101.a:0 "And so it goes."

 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_ULRIKE_MEINHOF_DESC:0 "A red state rises over the ashes of an old. Ulrike Meinhof, once a student organizer and one of Speer's most ardent and dedicated supporters has turned against her former ideals and destroyed everything that the student militias have fought so hard to build.\n\nShe preaches fire and fury. Who is Speer? The man has never been an ardent supporter of the cause. This became more clear by the day. Is he a Burgundian, simply here to ensure the rebels never reach their peak? He certainly never prosecuted the war as strongly as he could, despite accusations of child soldiers and a thousand other claims.\n\nWhat is his cause? What is liberalism in a Reich? What is liberalism when it's being led by a man a single shade of black away from Nazism? What use is liberalism when it goes against a power so evil as the slave empire of Germany? How does grey fight black? To truly do war, you must fire from as far away as possible. You can never copy your enemies ideals.\n\nCommunism, Socialism, Bolshevikism. Whatever the Nazis called it, many Germans grew up in utter ignorance of what it truly meant. Meinhof was different however, and she knew one thing was most important of all, whatever it was, it was as far divorced from Nazism as one could imagine.\n\nTo truly defeat evil, one must become what evil fears. Meinhof sees herself not only as a liberator of the people and the one who will break the chains the Reich has foisted upon them, but as the monster hiding under the Nazis bed."
