 POLITICS_KEITH_HOLYAOKE_DESC:0 "Who would have thought that New Zealand will ever be imperiled in its lifetime? So far away from the goings-on of the world, the sleepy dominion had never faced such a threat as to demand her people's attention. Many had lived their lives fully believing that these peaceful days, where the sun rises, the sheep bleat, and the sunsets,would stretch out into eternity. One of them was a man named Keith Holyoake.\n\nA gifted clerk, Holyoake's temperament was suited for service. He tended to the family farm when he was a lad after Grandpa died, picking hops and tobacco to make cold beer and fine cigar. He ran a general store with Mom and Dad in small Mangamutu, selling cans of beans and bread until they ran out of stock. Eventually, he represented the constituents of Motueka Electorate, fighting for the interests of farmers and ranchers under the National Party's blue banner.\n\nLike many New Zealanders, Holyoake had thought that a life of peaceful service in His Majesty's Government awaited him until his peaceful passing. Then Germania yanked Mother Britannia away from her sons, in the grim days of 1943, while the Rising Sun burned Asia and the Pacific Isles into cinders. Suddenly, what New Zealand had once taken for granted -- safety, surety and security -- were gone.\n\nHolyoake and his government seized the reins of state in tumultuous times for their small nation. Their modest economy has emulated their large sibling across the ditch, edging closer towards malaise with every dip. Their armed forces is in shambles, barely enough to present an obstacle for the Sphere. Their people, nervous and anxious beneath a stiff upper lip. For the first time in its history, New Zealand feared the future to come.\n\nClouds gather far in the horizon, darkening the good earth, and the light of liberty grows dimmer by the hour. But wherever it goes, New Zealand shall follow. With deft hands, an adept mind and God's good grace, Kiwi Keith will lead it through the coming storm and into placid waters once more."

NZL_Relative_Isolation:0 "Relative Isolation"
NZL_Relative_Isolation_desc:0 "On the west lies the Tasman Sea, and on the north and east the Pacific Ocean. Antarctica lies some thousand miles to the south. Peppered liberally in all directions are rocks, islands, volcanoes and atolls of all shapes and sizes. In other words: New Zealand is too far away from the rest of the world for its happenings to elicit much alarm. Of course, the Rising Sun is a glaring exception -- but thanks to the OFN, their presence has lulled into a dull heat. Three cheers for blissful isolation!"

NZL_American_Dominated_Trade:0 "American-Dominated Trade"
NZL_American_Dominated_Trade_desc:0 "Hersheys and Coke now line the storefronts where Cadburys and Twinings once were, and old Rolls-Royces had given way to sleek, shiny Fords and Chrystlers in the busy streets of Wellington. As the old Empire collapsed, America stepped in to fill the void it left behind. Tiny New Zealand had nothing to compete with, so it gracefully accepted the supremacy of yet another hegemon in its own economy. Such is life for such a small nation."

NZL_Urbanization_Crisis:0 "Urbanisation Crisis"
NZL_Urbanization_Crisis_desc:0 "New Zealand's cities double in size and people from year to year, blessing Wellington with extra hands and extra revenue. The same cannot be said for its food output. With only slightly over two percent of New Zealand's earth available for farming, the country has a stricter limit than most on how much it can sustainably feed. As its cities grow unimpeded, however, we may cross that threshold much sooner than first thought..."
