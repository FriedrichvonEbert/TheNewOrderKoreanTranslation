 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_RURIK_II_DESC:0 "니콜라이 이바노비치 크릴로프 소장은 한때 붉은 군대의 장교로, 세바스토폴과 보로실로프그라드 등지의 전투들에서 62군의 참모장을 맡았습니다. 그러나 대조국전쟁이 그저 소련의 막대한 패배가 되먼서, 크릴로프는 몸과 마음이 모두 다쳤고, 끊임없는 퇴각의 스트레스가 신경쇠약으로 이어졌습니다. 그러나 62군은 이미 붕괴되었기에, 그의 고통에 영향을 받지는 않았습니다. 부대가 없는 그와 일단의 장교들은 우랄 산맥을 넘어 쏟아지는 난민의 물결에 합류해 동쪽으로 향했고, 결국 중앙 시베리아 공화국에서 그의 상관들을 발견했습니다. 공화국은 시베리아 흑군이라는 무정부주의자 반란을 해결하기 위해 크릴로프를 파견했으나, 그는 굴욕적인 패배를 당했고, 나중에는 그가 믿었던 부하 중 하나인 안드레예프 장군에게 크라스노야르스크에서 배신당했고, 부대를 케메로보로 퇴각시킬 수 밖에 없었습니다. 그 곳에서, 그는 자신의 고통과 죄책감을 무디게 하기 위해서, 손에 넣을 수 있는 것이라면 무엇이든 마시고 피워, 더 깊은 인사불성 상태에 빠졌습니다.\n\n그러나 어느 날, 갑자기 변화가 일어났습니다. 담배 한 갑과 보드카 세 병, 그리고 정교회 신비주의 서적만을 가지고 벌거벗은 채 방에 처박혀있던 한 저녁이 지나고, 그는걸어나와 러시아를 재통합하라는 명령을 받았다고 선포하였습니다. 누구로부터? 그에 대한 대답은 없었습니다. 그의 지휘관 동지들은 그의 정신상태를 우려했고, 크릴로프가 스스로를 '류리크 2세, 황제이자 전 루스의 군주'로 선언하자 그들의 공포는 가중되었습니다. 그러나, 그들의 우려는 정복과 영광의 약속에 끌린 병사들과 용병들로부터의 지지의 물결에 압도당했습니다.\n\n류리크 2세는 러시아 전통주의와 소비에트 군국주의의 절충적 혼합을 설파합니다. 그는 차르주의 전통의 후계자임을 주장하면서도, 로마노프 가문을 경멸합니다; 그는 블라디미르 1세의 미덕에 대해 이야기하면서도, 그 자신은 무신론자이며 성직자들을 "사기꾼에 마술사들"이라고 일축합니다. 그의 잡탕 사상은 그의 지지자들로 대표되는데, 그들은 반동주의자들, 소련의 참전용사들, 그리고 용병들이 뒤섞인 집단입니다. 그의 장교단 내의 몇몇 사람들은 이 모든 "류리크"같은 행동이 농민들의 지지를 얻어내기 위한 가식이 아닐지 의심합니다; 만약 그렇다고 한다면, 그는 캐릭터를 굉장히 잘 유지하고 있다 하겠습니다."

 POLITICS_KING_YURIY_DESC:0 "만약 유리 니콜라예비치 크릴로프에게 당신이 언젠가 되살아난 러시아 군주정의 지도자가 될 것이라 20년 전에 말했다면, 그는 의심할 여지 없이 이를 전혀 믿지 않았을 것입니다. 그럼에도, 실로 기이한 일련의 사건들을 통해, 유리는 아버지의 거의 영웅적인 유산의 확고한 계승자로 떠올랐습니다.\n\nAs a young man, Yuriy took after his father and joined the army of the Central Siberian Republic as an officer, where he distinguished himself as an energetic and capable leader. During his time on the front, he saw firsthand the devastating effects of war upon the poor and disadvantaged of Russia. Although he continued to rise through the ranks, Yuriy became frustrated with his inability to make a real difference in the name of the people.\n\nYuriy's life would soon become even more hectic when his father suffered what appeared to be a severe mental break. When he emerged again as Rurik II, he was quick to establish his progeny as nobility in his self-proclaimed kingdom. After a short period of confusion and concern for his father, Prince Yuriy eventually came to see the kingdom as a chance to make his ideals a reality. The path towards the crown was fraught with political intrigue, but despite these challenges Yuriy would eventually be named as Rurik II's rightful successor.\n\nNow christened as Rurik III in honor of his late father, the King intends to make good on his lofty goals. Under his reign, Rurik III intends to lay the foundations of a more fair and just kingdom, one which looks to the rights of its people first and foremost."

 POLITICS_QUEEN_LYDIA_DESC:0 "From the chaos and confusion of the Russian warlord era arises Rogneda I, the Wolf Queen of Rus'. The woman formerly known as Lydia Krylova's rise to power was nothing short of meteoric, and she now stands tall as the most powerful authority of the resurrected Russian nation.\n\nIt was not always destined to be like this. Once upon a time, Lydia was a volunteer nurse helping with the rear echelon of the Central Siberian Republic's military. What she witnessed during her time shaped her character dramatically: countless men and women putting their lives on the line for causes they did not fully understand, without any indication that their sacrifices were making a difference. Russia was dying, and this could not be more tangible to Lydia, who was able to witness the effects of these death throes with her own eyes.\n\nWhen her father emerged from his mental lapse as Rurik II, Lydia immediately saw this as her opportunity to turn the tide. As the Kingdom's power continued to grow, so too did the Wolf Princess'. Eventually, she was forced to compete with her own brother for the throne, but her passionate and ruthless drive saw Lydia through to take his place as Rurik II's rightful heir.\n\nNewly reborn as Queen Rogneda, she intends to restore strength and honor to the wounded Russia nation, no matter what the cost may be."

 ### Ideas ###
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom:0 "Esoteric Kingdom"
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom_desc:0 "His Majesty Rurik II is a man burning with desire to see all traitors and all despoilers of Holy Russia perish. Normally, this would be the kind of man our shattered land would need, but his mental state has led to him developing some... interesting ideas as to how the Restoration of the Motherland should proceed. Some may find hope and inspiration in his drive, true, but most of his neighbors would only see a madman."

 KEM_the_two_wolves:0 "The Two Wolves"
 KEM_the_two_wolves_desc:0 "The King's children, Yuriy and Lydia, while both exemplary advisors and administrators, each have their own, radically different ways of governance. Prince Yuriy favors a lighter, more populist touch, and urges his father to give his subjects the power to decide their own fates.\n\nPrincess Lydia, on the other hand, espouses a more militaristic, hierarchical ideal. She urges her father to closen his relationship with the military and to distance himself from the commoners, for none of them are as fit as he to wear the burden of leadership upon their shoulders."

 KEM_kings_unions:0 "The King's Unions"
 KEM_kings_unions_desc:0 "In a bizarre symbiosis of the ancient ways of the Rus and the modern ideals of the Bolsheviks, King Rurik has declared that trade unions will be free to operate within reason. This has, surprisingly, served the King well, as the peasants who might otherwise call for his overthrow are now placated by their state-sponsored Unions. However, if the people are given a taste of freedom, who knows where it may lead them?"

 KEM_kings_unions_2:0 "Royal Unions Strengthened"
 KEM_kings_unions_2_desc:0 "Following national developments, the trade unions operating within the state have been strengthened, and operate with even fewer restrictions or oversight than before. Workers and union officials have indicated their pleasure at these developments, confident that they represent their King's concern for their situation."

 KEM_kings_unions_3:0 "Royal Unions Unshackled"
 KEM_kings_unions_3_desc:0 "Trade unions within the state have been nearly entirely unshackled, operating with a freedom uncommon outside of ostensibly socialist states. Workers across the nation rejoice, extremely pleased that their King cares enough about their conditions to permit their association."

 KEM_unions_subdued:0 "Royal Unions Subdued"
 KEM_unions_subdued_desc:0 "The Royal Unions have been subdued, with their rights restricted and with more stringent regulations imposed upon them. Workers across the nation are, understandably, quite upset at this development, while others insist that they simply do not understand that the state has more productive ideas in mind for their organization."

 KEM_unions_subdued2:0 "Royal Guilds"
 KEM_unions_subdued2_desc:0 "The Royal Unions have been restructured into the Royal Guilds. These institutions will ensure that the workers over which they exercise oversight are working harmoniously in support of the state and its goals. As a secondary function, they also manage workforce concerns to the greatest degree reasonably possible without impeding efficiency."

 KEM_idea_raising_an_army:0 "Raising An Army"
 KEM_idea_raising_an_army_desc:0 "Conscription has been introduced into the realm in an effort to rapidly expand the military's size. Though this is of course necessary to ensure proper security against the state's many enemies, it is extremely unpopular with the common people, and will hamper the government's political endeavors."

 KEM_revolutionary_king:0 "Revolutionary King"
 KEM_revolutionary_king_desc:0 "At the behest of Prince Yuriy, King Rurik's revolutionary past and service in the Red Army has been emphasized in state propaganda. In doing so, the commitment of the state to those ideals will be reinforced, and the people will see that the King leads by example."

 KEM_a_new_sobor:0 "A New Sobor"
 KEM_a_new_sobor_desc:0 "Continuing reforms, the Zemsky Sobor has been increasingly empowered and given authority over various state functions. Intended to facilitate eventual transition of the state to a democratic parliamentary monarchy, this action serves to decisively prove this commitment to the people."

 KEM_militarist_king:0 "Militarist King"
 KEM_militarist_king_desc:0 "At the behest of Princess Lydia, King Rurik's military triumphs in past service, against both the Germans and the insurgent anarchists of the Black Army, have been emphasized in state propaganda. In doing so, the people will see that the state remains surrounded by enemies, and that a powerful and expanded military is necessary."

 KEM_a_new_hierarchy:0 "A New Hierarchy"
 KEM_a_new_hierarchy_desc:0 "Continuing reforms, Princess Lydia has decreed her intention to establish a new social order, and thus a societal hierarchy. Naturally, military officers and noble aristocrats are positioned at the top – such is the only correct course of action, after all as, absent proper leadership, how can anything of note be accomplished?"

 KEM_kingsguard_supremacy:0 "Kingsguard Primacy"
 KEM_kingsguard_supremacy_desc:0 "The Kingsguard has expanded its influence on the state's political affairs at the behest of Princess Lydia, with many of its officers accepting positions of importance overseen by her faction in the pursuit of future wealth, status, and glory."

 KEM_kingsguard_academy:0 "Kingsguard Academy"
 KEM_kingsguard_academy_desc:0 "In an effort to ensure that the state's future army is led by properly trained and professional officers, the Kingsguard Academy has been established. It is expected that the positive effects of this professionalization will be observed within the military in short order."

 KEM_pride_of_the_king:0 "Pride of the King"
 KEM_pride_of_the_king_desc:0 "United behind their King, the state's military is motivated, enthusiastic, and eager to march in support of his goals and political vision. Though the soldiery is well aware that challenges will be faced, they are just as equally confident that their King will guide them to eventual victory."

 KEM_the_peoples_guard:0 "The People's Guard"
 KEM_the_peoples_guard_desc:0 "At Prince Yuriy's insistence, the Kingsguard has been disbanded and replaced with the People's Guard, a force that he, and many others, consider to be far less concerned with their own position and primacy, and more concerned with the protection of the state and its citizenry."

 KEM_ship_expansion:0 "Constructing a Royal Fleet"
 KEM_ship_expansion_desc:0 "With the acquisition of a coastline, the state has committed to the construction of a number of warships in order to patrol and secure its territorial waters. Targeted investments have been made in order to ensure rapid production."

 KEM_trade_deals:0 "Lucrative Trade Deals"
 KEM_trade_deals_desc:0 "Promoting economic expansion, the state has sent diplomats to many foreign countries to both negotiate favorable trade deals and invite foreign businesses to establish operations. These efforts cannot but generate lucrative rewards."

 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king:0 "미친 왕의 통치"
 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king_desc:0 "Nikolay Krylov, now known as Rurik the Second, has so far proved to be an exceptionally eccentric ruler. His rule thus far has demonstrated his continuous ability to contradict himself on several subjects, and few believe that this ability will end any time soon. The Mad King has also decided upon strengthening the military in order to strike out against our neighbors, which he sees as rebellious subjects.\n\nThere is clearly plenty the King has to do before he can embark on the warpath. The King's children are both attempting to persuade His Highness to follow their visions for how to prepare the kingdom for the future wars. Judgments will have to be made on whether to follow the populist policies of Prince Yuriy or the brutal pragmatism of Princess Lydia.\n\nRurik will need to determine the direction of the economy, the army and the society he wishes to establish. Once these challenges have been overcome, we can set out on the warpath."

 KEM_the_kings_industry:0 "왕의 산업"
 KEM_the_kings_industry_desc:0 "After the past deterioration of our standing in the region, it was assumed that we were doomed to obscurity due to our complete lack of fortune. Or so it seemed, after all we still control the industrious city of Kemerovo.\n\nIf we were to utilize and advance the output of the city, producing new guns and equipment, equipping freshly trained soldiers and extending these plans to enhance our infrastructure, improving the mobility of our army and workers.\n\nMaybe we could once again take our place as a relevant contender in the region under the ambitious King Rurik II."

 KEM_support_the_unions:0 "Support the Unions"
 KEM_support_the_unions_desc:0 "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nCrown Yuriy Krylov has expressed his support for the existing trade unions, emphasizing how expansion of our output will never be sustainable without the support of the workers in the factories.\n\nThis choice will pose a bizarre conflict to the new monarchy which his majesty has created, but such an unusual contradiction will be nothing new to those who know the king."

 KEM_the_will_of_the_people:0 "The Will of the People"
 KEM_the_will_of_the_people_desc:0 "Now that His Highness has determined on following a more progressive approach to our economy, we shall endeavour to begin laying out the new foundations of our supportive economy.\n\nNew legislation will be put into place to protect the rights of the kingdom's loyal and diligent industrial workers and unions will be strengthened. Popular policies like these will be necessary if we are to keep our working classes devoted to the cause of the king.\n\nFor the will of the people shall not be ignored for as long as King Rurik is around to hear it."

 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king:0 "And the Power of the King"
 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king_desc:0 "His Highness has heard the outcry of the people and he has listened, our recent attempts at restructuring the economy have proved very popular with the poorer members of our society.\n\nImprovements in the conditions of workers have already begun to improve, along with popular support for the king's rule. But if these trends are to continue, power will have to remain in the hands of the king, after all his grace has proved himself to be a worthy leader of the working classes.\n\nThe cooperation of the people with the authority of the monarch will be required if our economy is to improve."

 KEM_a_change_in_course:0 "A Change in Course"
 KEM_a_change_in_course_desc:0 "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nPrincess Lydia Krylova has planned to set out a proposal to the economic minister, Lev Voznesensky, which would undermine the current rights of workers, but significantly increase the extent of our production. After all, trade unions and collective action will only serve their own interests and oppose the greater aspirations of the king. If we were to put these plans into action, the king may lose the support of the workers in the future.\n\nWe must hope they can see the kingdom's true potential."

 KEM_lean_right:0 "Lean Right"
 KEM_lean_right_desc:0 "The time has come to break with the outdated economic system that our kingdom currently upholds, unions and worker's rights have proven only to be obstacles to our economic potential.\n\nRemoving these laws and significantly reducing the power of the unions, will certainly benefit our short term output and remove a substantial amount of power from the hands of the union leaders. But we continue to run the risk of antagonizing the working classes, as they still believe that the old system works best for them.\n\nRegardless of this risk, we shall push ahead with the necessary reforms to unleash our as yet unrealized economic potential."

 KEM_a_truly_free_market:0 "A Truly Free Market"
 KEM_a_truly_free_market_desc:0 "Following the success of our recent reforms to the economy, it is obvious that we should continue to pursue the plan put forward by Princess Lydia and liberate the markets from its remaining restrictions.\n\nState intervention will be limited and the last of the unions will be muzzled, in order to create an environment for a truly free market.\n\nSoon we will only need to wait for the inevitable boost to the efficiency of our industry that will inevitably arrive, establishing a great advantage over our surrounding enemies."

 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age:0 "An Economy for the Modern Age"
 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age_desc:0 "We have, at long last, completed the necessary reforms to our industry that will develop a suitable base for future production. The direction of the royal economy has ultimately been decided, for better or for worse, the days of our ineffective economy are gone, and Kemerovo has truly become home to an economy fit for the modern age. The extra capacity that our changes have brought will prove instrumental to our future prospects in the region.\n\nHis Majesty is pleased with the kingdom's progress, there is now a lot less holding back the King's immense ambitions."

 KEM_the_kings_society:0 "The King's Society"
 KEM_the_kings_society_desc:0 "The order of the kingdom's society is yet to be determined, two clear options from His Highnesses' children have emerged. First, the ideals of Prince Yuriy, which would remarkably improve the political rights of the people of Kemerovo and promote equality amongst the population.\n\nAlternatively, Princess Lydia offers a more pragmatic vision of Kemerovo's society, which would entail closer links with the military and an enforcement of a strict hierarchy to ensure stability.\n\nWhoever King Rurik decides to follow, will have an increase in their power and influence within the realm."

 KEM_prince_yuriys_ideals:0 "Prince Yuriy's Ideals"
 KEM_prince_yuriys_ideals_desc:0 "Crown Prince Yuriy, the heir to the throne, has attempted to influence the king to make reforms to increase the freedoms and power of the people. The prince argues that his idealistic vision will inspire people, whereas his sisters' bleak, repressive structure for society will only create resentment.\n\nA liberated population will limit resistance to the rule of the king; our subjects throughout the rest of Central Siberia will also be less inclined to resist us.\n\nPrince Yuriy assures His Highness that these adjustments will ensure the realms stability and prospects for the future."

 KEM_king_ruriks_revolutionary_past:0 "King Rurik's Revolutionary Past"
 KEM_king_ruriks_revolutionary_past_desc:0 "Prince Yuriy has decided to popularize the old values that King Rurik fought for when he served as a revolutionary soldier of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the masses have been reminded of the King's history, they will be reassured that the rights they have maintained so far will be protected. Considering how Rurik has already preserved the state atheism of the Soviet Union the continuation of such policies will come as no surprise.\n\nHis Majesty will protect all from injustice, as he already and always will."

 KEM_a_kingdom_of_equals:0 "A Kingdom of Equals"
 KEM_a_kingdom_of_equals_desc:0 "The Crown Prince has continued to advocate and implement his ideals across the realm, he now plans to promote programs that will improve equality throughout the kingdom.

 KEM.1.t:0 "The King in Kemerovo"
 KEM.1.desc:0 "Sergei walked up the long and heavily decorated stairs leading into the Grand Palace of Kemerovo, the residence of the great Rurik the Second and his family. He could not help but notice the signs of destruction from the days of the Siberian War in what used to be the local Gorkom headquarters. Thankfully, the new rulers of the land had gone to great lengths to hastily repair the building. The Rurikid ensign was visible in every object and wall, often simply replacing the hammer and sickle, and more than likely bolstering the ego of General Nikolay Krylov. Modern comforts were combined with medieval architecture in an unexpected way.\n\n"You shall have an audience with His Majesty in precisely two hours", was the response of the secretary. Until then, Sergei could admire the wonderful artwork and furniture, occasionally peeking out of the window to enjoy the view of the central square - even though the arrival of winter discouraged many from spending time there.\n\nAt exactly twelve o'clock, the wooden doors of the palace opened, and Sergei entered the King's residence not as a noble or a general, but a mere businessman. On an expensive throne, Rurik II sat and observed the economist with a judging look. Just as all the dozens of other men to have entered the room, Sergei truly had to prove his value to the mad king and his advisors. Undisturbed by the situation he was in, he outlined his plan of economic development and won the trust of the Royal Court, which seemed open to inviting him again. For all the rumours of him being an insane and brutal king, Rurik seemed awfully logical and pragmatic in person.\n\nThe man left the Palace, unsure if the story of Kemerovo's Tsar was a farce or a tragedy. Either way, that did not have an impact on the situation on the ground: the state was surrounded by enemies, and the choice of siding with the General was dangerous to make. Yet that did not stop some of his more affectionable subjects from doing just that."

He awoke in the early hours of the morning before anyone else in his household, was constantly drunk, and shied away from loud noises. He spoke softly, yet firmly, and seemed exactly of sound mind even while addressing himself as Tsar; or firmly insisting he be called Rurik II to everyone who called General Krylov by his old name.\n\nOccasionally, the servants mused amongst themselves about the king whilst he roamed the palace or resided on his throne. Was he truly mad? Was this what the horrors of war brought? No, others argued. The General is merely putting on an act to confuse and bewilder others. Yet, all of them knew the others had no concrete answer. The Tsar certainly gave none.\n\nWhat of it, then? If they were following a lunatic, he was a benevolent one who treated them well. If they were following a man talented enough to put on such an act, then clearly they were working for one of the greatest minds in Siberia. These thoughts at least, put them at ease as the breaks ended, or the Tsar called for them.\n\nYet still, the question lingered."

He hadn't done anything malicious or harmful to people like Ivan so far, in fact he seemed to really be dedicated to taking care of the Kemerovo's people. He made sure that the common man felt safe and protected, which Ivan had thought impossible ever since the Huns took Moscow. His outfits and palace might be a tad odd, but when he gave a speech, even a weary old man like Ivan felt in awe.

It was somewhat calming, and a good break from the throne room and his cynical sister.\n\nThere was still something off-putting, however. Wherever Yuriy went, there was a sense of fear. Fear of bandits, fear of raids. Fear of invasions from other warlords, and the fear that their family wouldn't have enough to eat that night. It was there and almost everywhere Yuriy went.\n\nThe people couldn't live like this, Yuriy thought. All the dread and despair deep inside everyone, it was unbearable. Every time he went to visit the town, he felt like something had to be done. Anything to improve people's lives, at least somewhat.\n\nWhat was he thinking, he was a prince! If someone could do something to help the people, it was him. Sure, his father did seem to care a lot for his Kingdom, but from what Yuriy saw, it wasn't enough.

Something has to be done, the people of our kingdom cannot continue to live in impoverishment. That is why I believe everyone deserves equality under their King. Life in fear and terror is not a way to live! If we are to be a modern Kingdom, we need to follow new ways. The welfare of the people must be assured, a King and his government cannot ignore their own citizens."\n\nYuriy looked around the room to see the people's reactions. Were they happy, eager even?

Now, Rurik has the opportunity to hear the opinions of his subjects even more, and it's safe to say the Kingdom is slowly moving towards democracy.\n\nWhile this does give more power to the common people of Kemerovo, the added power has also increased the influence of the nobles and priests as well. The common people may be able to voice their opinions now, but the rich nobleman now has the opportunity to use his influence in other means. The reformed Sobor may not be perfect, but in Yuriy's mind, the more voice the people have in government, the better.\n\nAnd while Yuriy may be satisfied for now, there is still much the Prince wants to see changed for the Kingdom can become a better place for everyone.

With her father carving out a fiefdom in Central Siberia, the entire family now had their own ideas on how to fix Russia. The Princess felt the best way to lead the kingdom was with a strong autocrat. Prince Yuriy, on the other hand, thought the best way was to follow the opinions of the people. Where he was idealistic, she was pragmatic. Where her brother was pacifistic, she was militaristic. Ironic, considering her past as a nurse, but necessary in the new order of things. Her brother just didn't understand the world they now lived in. Did he really think all the enemies that surrounded them would just hand over control to their father?\n\nNo, and that's where Yuriy would fail. Her goal wasn't to sit in Kemerovo and try to grow more food for the people while bandits continue to raid farms and murder their owners. Her goal - their family's goal, was to reunite Russia.

How could he not see that?\n\nIt took a lot less than she thought to transform an entire society, she wondered. One decree made by her father and an entire class system could be built out of nothing. A new hierarchy, she thought. The kingdom could only be ruled by order, and without order, there would be turmoil.\n\nThe new society that would be created would finally allow the elites to be on top. Her father would rule over a perfect and neat structure, where everyone knew their place. The noble's and military's rights to power would finally be upheld.\n\nAs Lydia watched her father sign her creation into law, she knew his Kingdom had become even more perfect. Kemerovo had to be kept powerful and out of the hands of uneducated peasants who know nothing about ruling a nation.

He had, in recent days, been speaking of changes to the state's laws and regulations around labor rights, and the introduction of new legislation. No doubt, the men agreed, prompted by Prince Yuriy.\n\nWhile all of them were pleased by the news, given the liberalizations promised, all were similarly skeptical. After all, change had been promised before and, more than once, had proven illusory at best. One man raised his concern that the Zemsky Sobor would muddle implementation. Another voiced certainty that Princess Lydia and her coterie would act to subvert any expansions so codified.\n\nBut, even with such concerns, there was hope. The general trend of state policy lately had been encouraging, and there was a natural tendency to believe that it would continue. That things would get better. The men spoke on this late into the evening.\n\nWhen they were done, they left, deeply in need of sleep. Legislation or no legislation, they had work tomorrow, and that work never ended."

He complied, and after preparing his position at the large conference table she kept prepared for such events, began to do so. He spoke of the challenges to the state's position that a transition to free-market policies would entail, but also of the many potential and long-term benefits besides, and how they might be implemented in governmental policy.\n\nThe Princess listened in near silence, asking only a few questions, but her stare never left. Her eyes bored into his own, near unblinking and as unsettling as ever, as she processed his words and the gears no-doubt turned in her head. Eventually, when he had finished, she asked him a single question: How would the proposals affect ordinary workers in the short term?\n\nHe knew why she was asking, as did every government officer, but he answered her truthfully, knowing she would instantly identify a lie, however small. It would hurt them, he said, as the economy reoriented and as some inefficient and unviable industries closed down. At that, she spoke, perhaps more to herself than to him. Prince Yuriy would not like that, he heard her say, but he would have to see the merit. She would make him see.\n\nVoznesensky was careful not to add his doubtful opinion.

Our subjects, meanwhile, have been all too happy to rush to the markets, which have become filled to the brim with valuable commodities from far and wide. It seems this frozen coal town has some real potential after all!\n\nOur glorious royal capital has found new life, and it is all thanks to the efforts of Princess Lydia and the Royal Minister of Finance's efforts to foster a free market economy in the realm. Prince Yuriy's camp, however, complained that this newfound success comes only at the expense of the worker's wellbeing.

Honesty would be the best policy then, he decided. "On occasion," He admitted. "I can't say I feel anything either way for the ideology, but they weren't all wrong either, and those were happier days for almost everyone.

The content of the mural was clear - join the military! - but the artwork was not.\n\nFor many in attendance, it reminded them of the standard practices of old Soviet artwork, with clear elements of Socialist Realism reflected in the depictions of the smiling and proud soldiers intended to be on display. For others, or perhaps for those younger and with fewer and less well-established memories of the old Union, it was very different.\n\nThe heavy lines and dark shadows, all oriented towards emphasizing a central figure in an almost religious light, all evoked memories of the medieval styles of the old Rurikid principalities that had been seen in museums, history books, and other such sources. The fusion was, all agreed, at least interesting, if not particularly attractive.\n\nOf course, none would dare voice such a perspective, not with the police closely watching, but the thought remained, to varying degrees, inside each of those watching."

"What- what are you doing here?"\n\n"Lydia?" Anastasia stuttered. "I mean Princess." she quickly corrected. She curtsied and assumed a respectful stance with her hands folded and head bowed. "I'm a nurse at this hospital, Princess. Please forgive me for my impoliteness. I meant no offense."\n\n"Oh, uh." Lydia looked at her hand, still stuck to Anastasia's arm. She let go and awkwardly returned her arm to her side. "I... didn't expect to see you here. How are you? How is Alexi?"\n\n"I am doing well. Alexi died two years ago, but our daughter, uh." Anastasia blushed in embarrassment. "Lydia has grown up to be a strong little girl."\n\n"That's good to hear, Anastasia." Lydia's face grew serious. "It's been good to see you."

The farmers were no longer holded up in their homesteads, but were not plowing and tilling their fields.\n\nAnd as the world came back to life, so did the Royal Army of Tsar Rurik.\n\nParade grounds were once again swarming with men. Firing ranges crackled as they had months prior. Cadets ran through obstacle courses, driven hard by generals to make sure that their men's skills had not deteriorated over the winter.

She had been selected by Princess Lydia to lead the Shieldmaidens, and both Anna and Lydia stood next to King Rurik in front of the palace doors.\n\nAnna Kotsur gave a speech thanking King Rurik for the opportunity to lead these brave women into battle. Her Russian had a noticeable Ukrainian accent, and King Rurik admittedly didn't catch every word she said. Nevertheless, her speech resonated with her troops, who applauded as King Rurik appointed her officially to the rank of General. After she concluded her speech, Princess Lydia gave a speech of her own. The Shieldmaidens had originally been her idea, and she gave a passionate speech about how the bravest soldiers in the realm will now finally have their chance to display their bravery upon the battlefield. Once she concluded, King Rurik stepped forward.\n\nHe thanked the shieldmaidens for choosing to serve their King in the most honorable fashion. No longer would the realm deprive women their chance to fight the enemies of the King upon the grand battlefield that Russia had become. With that said, King Rurik concluded his speech, and called for a 21-gun salute. The last gun signalled the end of the ceremony, and Anna Kotsur led the troops out of the courtyard."

He stood before Samusenko, his face difficult to read.\n\n"Aleksandra Samusenko, if you wish to serve King Rurik II, King of the Rus, then prove your loyalty and humility," stated the king, evidently referring to the boot he presented before her face. It felt humiliating having to kiss a man's boot, but that was likely the point of this whole act. One final test of loyalty.\n\n"Aleksandra Samusenko, please rise to your feet," stated King Rurik, and Aleksandra Samusenko did as he commanded. He placed the sword upon her right shoulder, and then the left, and withdrew the blade, "General Aleksandra Samusenko, may you serve this kingdom with pride and valor."\n\nSamusenko was beckoned to the side of the throne room as another Krasnoyarsk general stepped forward, and the same procedure repeated.

For long life, fair and just rule, and the unity of Russia." The words come to Rurik as if from far away, and the King nods slowly.\n\n"And this is widely believed today?" The King's question is not a statement of disbelief, and the priest nods as if it was expected.\n\n"The truth of the Church has survived as it has ages before. When we pray, Your Majesty, we are echoed across the realm. So it was for centuries past, so it is today."\n\nRurik nods, and despite his skepticism can feel something – emotion, perhaps, or maybe the weight of tradition before him. The King slowly nods, and when he next speaks the priest begins to smile."

His experience with the Council's formations in the war with Mengjiang had imparted him both with direct practical experience of the use of cavalry and other mobile formations, and with the challenges and opportunities offered by their use. He had brought this knowledge with him, but progress had been very slow.\n\nThat was not to say, he had to admit to himself grudgingly, that there had been no progress at all. Many of the junior officers, commissioned and otherwise, were eager to implement his teachings, and were stymied only by a lack of transport and communication equipment. And that equipment was arriving in greater quantity.\n\nHe was sure that, with a few more weeks or months of intensive exercises and drill, along with access to the needed equipment and infrastructure, he could properly impart his teachings, and thereby improve the combat capabilities of King Rurik's armies manyfold in open field actions.

For the first time in several weeks, our forces have reported minimal resistance to our..." Boris Krylov trailed off as he looked to his father. The king looked deeply troubled, his eyes distant and cold. Rurik II seemed to care little about the subject at hand, and it was obvious his mind was focused on something darker. "Father, what troubles you? You've been too quiet today."\n\nRurik II's eyes snapped to his son. "It's your siblings, Boris. What the hell am I supposed to do with them? Their disputes grow more venomous and destructive by the day, and I cannot bear to watch it any longer."\n\nBoris walked away from the map he had been presenting and sighed as he took a seat next to his father. The old king sounded utterly defeated. "I wish I could tell you. You know I was never one for politics, father."\n\n"Politics? You think this is about politics?! Yuriy and Lydia, my own flesh and blood, have become enemies, and I have done so little to stop them. What kind of father stands by while his children go to war?" Rurik II sounded as though he was on the verge of tears.\n\nBoris put a reassuring hand on his father's shoulder. "You've done what you could, father. As much as it pains us to see them fight, this may be the only way they can settle their differences."\n\nThe king's eyes grew distant once more. "Perhaps you're right, Boris. It's just, they used to be so close...""

 kemreg.2.desc:0 "The situation has changed dramatically from the grim hours we had endured several years ago. With the victory of His Majesty's armed forces, and the expansion of the realms's borders to encompass the entire Central Siberian region, the question has been raised of where exactly the Royal Court shall be located. Kemerovo was never intended to be the permanent center of royal authority, and was mostly chosen simply because it was the only noteworthy settlement available to us.\n\nNow that the region has been unified, we now have a few locations that could potentially be more suitable as the administrative center of the realm. Novosibirsk is the most obvious choice, being the largest and most populous city in all of Siberia. On top of being a vital industrial center, the city benefits from well-developed infrastructure and a strong agricultural base.\n\nAlternatively, we could move the court to the city of Krasnoyarsk, formerly controlled by Nikolai Andreev and his mutineers. While not necessarily as populous as Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk is still quite large by Siberian standards, and most importantly of all, is home to a critical junction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. This fact alone makes the city an appealing choice indeed.\n\nOf course, we could always decide to just stay in Kemerovo. Of all the potential choices, Kemerovo is the most centrally located, and benefits from having been developed into the stronghold of royal authority for many years. Of course, there is also the sentimental value: Kemerovo was where our kingdom was proclaimed in the first place, after all."

What was once thought to be a minor issue had since escalated to become another verbal battlefield for the two wolves, Prince Yuriy and Princess Lydia, to do battle on.\n\n"To intrude upon the rights of the local councils would be tantamount to tyranny, no matter how small the intrusion. Yes, today it may only be roads and telephone lines, but what of tomorrow? I wholeheartedly agree that the realm must be connected, but we cannot do it without the express consent of the people!" As always, Yuriy was nothing if not passionate.\n\nHis sister, Lydia, rolled her eyes. "Again with this talk of 'rights', Yuriy? How tiresome. Perhaps you would also like us to ask the ground if it would be okay for us to build on top of it? Maybe we should ensure that the God-given rights of the woodland animals aren't infringed upon either?" Laughter could be heard amongst some of the council in response.\n\nRurik II was distraught at the sight of his children arguing with each other in such a way, but did his level best not to show it. It was clear, however, that the two would not budge. Soon enough, the council would be looking to their king to break the deadlock..."

Prince Yuriy, now the heir to his father's legacy, rose from his seat. As he stood, silence once again washed over the room, and the entire council had turned their attention to their new Crown Prince. At such a sight, it was hard for Yuriy to avoid getting emotional.\n\n"I am deeply honored by your show of trust, father. Rest assured, your legacy shall not wither away with your passing. I will ensure that all the people of your realm are treated fairly and with the respect they rightfully deserve. Together, we shall work towards a more just kingdom, and a brighter future for all of Russia!" The applause resumed, more ferocious than last time. Yuriy couldn't help but notice that even those who had remained silent before had joined in.\n\nThe Crown Prince looked to Lydia, who had not so much as moved a muscle since the announcement. Her expression betrayed a deep anger, a fury so intense that it could not be expressed through words. Lydia suddenly locked eyes with her brother's, and Yuriy went cold. Her gaze pierced directly into Yuriy's soul, a stare almost murderous in nature. Turning away from her brother, Lydia got up from her seat and left the council chamber. Most were so swept up in the festivities, that they had neglected to notice the departure of the princess.\n\nDespite his victory, Yury couldn't help but feel some lingering regrets over the feud. Lydia's cold glance had told the Crown Prince all he needed to know about how his sister felt."

The newly-appointed Crown Princess and heir to the throne, Lydia, rose from her seat to address the Zemsky Sobor. As she stood before the entire council, silence had once again dominated the chamber.\n\n"From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for this great responsibility you have bestowed upon me, father. You will not find a soul more capable of continuing your glorious legacy as I. Know that I shall focus all of my efforts on continuing to bring strength and honor to the realm. I will not rest until the darkness that has befallen the Rus' has been banished through sheer force of will!"\n\nLydia's brief speech was punctuated by the boisterous return of the applause. As she surveyed the celebrations, Lydia felt more proud in that moment than any other in her entire life. Victory at last. Her wandering eyes eventually landed on her brother, Prince Yuriy, who had conspicuously abstained from joining in on the applause. As their eyes met, Lydia shot him a smug grin. Yuriy's disconnected demeanor quickly turned to that of smoldering anger, and the snubbed Prince quickly got up from his seat and made for the chamber's exit. Yuriy angrily slammed the door behind him, the noise startling some of the council members.\n\nAfter her brother departed, Lydia's smirk disappeared. She had secured the prize she had so desperately coveted, but was it really worth making an enemy of her own brother? Even now, the Crown Princess was not entirely sure."

For too long he had been forced to hold court in the frozen remnants of a proper city. Should the vision depicted within the model before him be realized, [KEM.Capital.GetName] would shine once more as a center of power fit for a monarch of Rurik II's stature.\n\nForeign Minister and Royal Architect Pyotr Baranovsky stood in the corner of the room looking on as his liege gleefully examined the model he had put together. Rurik II was usually a gloomy old fellow, but today his eyes betrayed the excitement of a child in a candy store. "I trust everything is to your liking, Your Grace?"\n\n"Masterful work as always, Baranovsky! Fleeting visions of Russia's past, transplanted into the present..." Rurik II's gaze remained focused on the model as he spoke, and he leaned in for a closer look. The proposed buildings were not unlike the kingdom itself- taking clear inspiration from the architectural legacy of medieval Russia, married with a sensibly modern touch. With walls of red and white crowned with a variety of garishly decorated roofs, the structures of the hypothesized city were a feast for the eyes.\n\nRurik finally managed to peel his attention away from the model and towards the architect. "Marvelous... simply marvelous. When can I expect the renovations to begin, Baranovsky?"\n\n"As soon as we are able, Your Grace. We just require-"\n\n"You will have it.

Disciplined, clean, and some of the finest men east of the Urals!"\n\nYakovlev's words had some merit, with Rurik having just seen the men perform a training exercise. They performed admirably, a far cry from the rag-tag, desperate men Rurik had left after Andreev's betrayal. Of course, there was still room for improvement, the equipment they carried was still outdated, albeit some progress there had been made in the last couple of months. Rurik brought up these concerns, amongst others, and Yakovlev largely agreed, "Yes, the situation regarding equipment and uniforms is less than desired, and the men can lose morale easier than I like, but I'd say that we've improved greatly, Your Majesty. If we ignore the issue of equipment, in which my hands are tied, how does Your Majesty feel about the state of your army?"'\n\n"They seem more disciplined, you've done a lot of good work here, Yakovlev.

 kemreg.8.desc:0 "As King Rurik's army grew, it became clear he needed more men to lead them. Unfortunately, most of the Royal Court's candidates were already in charge of armies. He needed to look beyond his own trusted allies, and look for candidates from elsewhere in Central Siberia. Specifically, the former generals of Novosibirsk, Tomsk, and the People's Revolutionary Council. If these men swear loyalty to King Rurik, we can pardon them for their crimes of aiding enemy regimes, and integrate them into our forces. Of course, some of King Rurik's advisors say that pardoning these former generals is too dangerous, and that we can't trust them.\n\nOnly a few advisors protest integrating the generals of Novosibirsk, whose ideology, or lack thereof, is most compatible with our own. They would be the easiest to integrate, but some worry they may attempt to overthrow the king in favor of the military, like they did to the Central Siberian Republic.\n\nThe generals of Tomsk are not rejected for fear of a military coup, instead we fear their ideology. The generals of Tomsk are feared to be radical republicans, and a number of the advisors protest their integration for this reason.\n\nThen there are the generals from the People's Revolutionary Council. Almost the entire court believes them to be unforgivable, and many call for the socialists to be rounded up and exiled away from the realm. However, some argue that any of their generals who can betray their Marxist ideals enough to swear fealty to King Rurik can be sufficiently trusted.\n\nAll of this discussion matters not, in the end, it is the King's decision to issue a royal pardon. Who will he choose?"
 kemreg.8.a:0 "No pardons shall be given, none may stand against the King."
 kemreg.8.b:0 "Pardon the Novosibirsk generals, we need their experience."

The great leaders of the world look at me as though I was a crazy old man playing dress up. A monarch of my prestige does not deserve to be treated this way!"\n\n"With all due respect, my liege, don't you think we have more important things to worry about than our image?" There was a pause.

This claim can be corroborated with reports from the CIA, who confirm that there has indeed been a dramatic shift of the balance of power in the region. While they still do not have a clear picture of the situation, the implication suggests that this "Rurik II" may very well have become a powerful new player in the Russian game.\n\nMonarchist movements are nothing new to Russia, but we have so far been unable to find any man by the name of Rurik who holds a claim to the throne. Stranger still was the ambassador's appearance. Diplomatic officials who were present to witness the meeting described his attire as "straight out of a renaissance fair" and "worthy of a Halloween costume".\n\nEstablishment of diplomatic relations with this "Rurik" could provide much needed information on the dire situation in Russia, and his regime could potentially serve as a key partner for our potential strategic interests in the region. After all, who are we to turn down friendly ties in times like these? On the other hand, more skeptical minds in the State Department are suggesting that the whole thing is merely an elaborate hoax, and should be ignored..."

This request is not to be taken lightly, and represents an important crossroads for relations with the bizarre Russian regime.\n\nWhile the Russian diplomats assure us that an investment would be of great benefit to both parties, some of our economists are not nearly as idealistic and consider the prospect a waste of America's valuable resources.

He requests that we send some to Central Siberia to support these efforts, and assures that we will be well-compensated for our show of good faith.\n\nWhile this would surely help with strengthening relations with Rurik II's regime and continue to support a friendly face in Russia, some of our officials have pointed out that the situation in Russia is still quite dangerous and sending Americans to this war-torn country would put their lives in unnecessary danger.

In time all that will remain of such brutal efficiency will be scarred and empty land.\n\nHowever, these thoughts were not present for those in power.

Many would be left unemployed and the states finances would be much worse off as a result.\n\nIn the end all Baranovsky could come up with was the assurance that one day Siberia's vast wealth would be uncovered.

He thought it better to keep it more authentic than diplomatic.\n\nRurik found the start of his writing the hardest, he had no idea where to begin let alone how to conclude the damned thing. Yet as the night went on, and the bottle on his desk got emptier, he realised that the words flowed from his pen with ease.\n\nBy the time he had scrawled his name at the bottom of the page he was quietly impressed with his efforts. Such length and such style could have only been the work of his genius. He did not bother to reanalyse what he wrote, instead he had it sealed and sent off right away.\n\nBaranovsky was quite taken aback once he had learnt of the news that the king had sent off the declaration without first requesting him to read over it.

Besides he would like to read more of it, and he would have had it not been so awfully written, and in russian.\n\nInstead he found a translator who might have been able to read the appalling work easier than he had. Yet the translator struggled enormously with this task, the phrases were muddled, the word choices bizarre and the punctuation non-existent. Try as he might he could not decipher what was written, he even began to question whether it had been written in some other foreign language he had not heard of.

Despite expert care it soon became apparent to everyone the King was dying.\n\nThe King awoke one last time, finding himself surrounded by his family. His children at his bedside. Yurily and Lydia even putting aside their differences at least for the day. He hoped it would last, that they would finally come together as a family. Perhaps they were too far gone, but perhaps not. Regardless, it was not his heir he spoke to, for he had said all that needed to be said to them days ago. It was Boris, the one among them who never had aspirations beyond duty and family.\n\n"Tell me, are the people happy? Is our Kingdom strong enough?"

"Good, good. Then this whole charade was worth it in the end."\n\nHis children didn't question his final words. Perhaps assuming it was madness like others had done since the beginning. Perhaps it was madness, but that didn't matter. Russia was nearly whole again, united and strong. He had done all he could for the people, his heir would do so much more, of that he was certain.

It was the people who made this kingdom possible after all; they deserved to see such a momentous occasion first hand.\n\nHe turned away from the railing, glancing briefly at his sister, who stared at him from the sidelines. Looking indignant and annoyed but not as angry as he once would have expected from her. He then looked at his father's crown, held by a union leader, selected by raffle for this occasion. He placed his hand on the crown, turning to speak into the microphone.\n\n"This crown is far more than a birthright, it is a vow, a promise to all the people of this great kingdom."

In the past, the Romanovs were crowned by a member of the church, as a sign their power ultimately came from god. The Rus had no time for such superstitious nonsense. The crown was held by one of the Queensguard, and no one would crown Lydia but herself. She grabbed the crown, one she had specifically made for her. Holding in her hands she felt a pain of regret. Her father was dead, her brother in exile. Whatever the kingdom would face in years to come, she would have to do it without them.\n\nShe killed such thoughts. For the sake of the kingdom she would have to move past these doubts, move past even being Lydia. Bury the Princess like she buried the nurse so long ago.

His rule had not been peaceful, and it had not been perfect, but he had achieved a great deal.\n\nThe sun was halfway below the horizon, the orange sky turning to red, and the red fading to purple. The first stars began to shine down from the heavens, outnumbered by the lights from the city below.The King grew weaker with every passing day, and he now needed a cane to move about his palace. Rurik knew he would not live to see Moscow freed from the Germans who enslaved his people. He would have to leave that duty to his successor, his heir. He knew that they could succeed, he believed he had prepared them well. His child would lead this Kingdom to greatness, and avenge the humiliation the Motherland had been put through. Nikolai Krylov chuckled, knowing that his children and the rest of the nation were so attached to the Rurikid ideals, the mask he had eventually become.\n\nThe sun was now below the horizon, and night had fallen over the Motherland once more.

Rurik was quite sure it would become a staple piece of [KEM.Capital.GetName] for years to come.\n\nOf course, the sculptor clearly took some artistic liberties. Rurik quite often would not go into battle carrying a sword while riding a horse, no matter how much he wanted to. He also was not as muscular as he was in the sculpture, but still, Rurik was quite pleased. He quite liked how it was overly romanticized, and he had to make sure the sculptor was paid well for his work.\n\nAnd if this was enough to be put up just for the unification of Central Siberia, he couldn't dream of what would be put up in his honor once Moscow was back in Russia's grasp."

Responded Ruirk.\n\n"As you say, Tsar Rurik the Second, by the Grace of God, the Conquerer and the Almighty. I humble in your presence." Said the old aristocrat, now bowing.\n\nRurik paused, but he was distracted by another young aristocrat. "You're as good as putting on a banquet as you are at ruling the Kingdom!" He said.

The item on the agenda concerned the recruitment restrictions and desired qualifications for state bureaucrats, primarily as it concerned their social status. True to his roots, Prince Yuriy favoured relaxing or even eliminating them altogether, both in order to promote social advancements as well as to connect the ordinary people to their government in stronger fashion.\n\nAt that, Lydia responded with her usual cutting, derisive laughter. The people, she proclaimed, were unreliable at best, and insurrectionist at worse. Bureaucrats should be hand-picked from the aristocracy, she argued, in order to ensure both that they owed their loyalty to the institutions of government, and were unlikely to have sympathies with revolutionary elements.\n\nThe 'debate' continued as most expected. Yuriy called his sister a tyrant, and she called him a fool, with the epithets only escalating from there and those in attendance silently counting the minutes where they would once again be free, unwilling to place themselves in the line of fire.\n\nThough all, including the royal siblings, knew that a decision would eventually be made by their father."

He had led this church, and the small community around it, for decades, doing his best to provide guidance and support to the simple - yet pious - people of the local villages. And now he was not sure if he would ever be permitted to return.\n\nHe had heard from his fellow priests about this happening elsewhere, churches taken over by the military, who greatly valued the belltowers for observation and the cellars for protection. More than one had been destroyed by the enemy if and when the fighting had turned. More still, though left standing, were returned to their once-shepherds in terrible condition. He dearly hoped that would not be the case for him.\n\nAs the soldiers finished packing and carefully stacked the boxes beside the doorway, Kiril took one last look around the now-empty nave, and realized how much larger it seemed when bereft of fixtures.

You declared yourself Tsar after you had too much to drink!"\n\nRurik smirked. "At least I am wise enough to defeat your armies in battle." The group grew quiet, almost hostile. "As I was saying... I invited you here today for your ideas. Central Siberia is hard to govern, and our economic situation is less than positive. Your salons were among those who governed Central Siberia when Russia first fell apart. We are all Russians, and this is our home."\n\nThe room remained quiet until a man with glasses broke the silence. "Rurik, we may have our disagreements, but I can tell you are a caring man. If you truly want to make the lives of the people better, I implore you to consider greater welfare for the people. War has ravaged Russia, and they need hope of a better future."\n\n"Who needs welfare!" Shouted a small man in a tie that reached down to his waist. "We don't have the money for that! What the people need is education, only then will they be able to improve their lives themselves and serve their country. No man can just throw money into the air and expect their problems to be fixed!"\n\nAnother man, slender and wearing a formal looking hat stood up. "The people will not have satisfaction without democracy! As long as you continue to be a tyrant, Tsar, this place will see only despair!"\n\nAs the shouting match continued and more men began to speak over each other, Rurik was reminded of his children's own petty bickering. No wonder Tomsk fell, it's own government couldn't agree on anything."

"Today, I bring to you people of Russia great news!" He proclaimed. "The great highway connecting Krasnoyarsk, Kemerovo, and Novosibirsk has, as of yesterday, been completed! Rejoice, for now nothing will hinder the free movement of trade and of you, the people!" The crowd murmured among themselves, though for the most part they seemed unsure what to make of the finished development. No matter. Worst comes to worst they'd have to come around. After all, whether they liked it or not, the highway would play a large part of their lives from now on.\n\nOver the next few days, traffic on the highway increased at first slowly, then exponentially, with reports of booming trade arriving at Voznesensky's office. It was just as he had thought; with any obstacles removed from their path, people couldn't resist the allure of traveling elsewhere to sell their wares for more. It was astounding that the old government in Tomsk had never thought of this, but then, he had never placed much stock into them anyways.\n\nYes, he thought, lighting a cigarette between his teeth, this was going to make a lot of people a lot of money.\n\nMost importantly, of course, himself."

Hard hat on his head and hammer slung over his shoulder, Gavril squinted against the morning glare as he gazed upon the factory complex he had once worked in. It certainly had been refurbished, and this gave him and many others preparing to enter the building hope that the mad old king had actually kept his promise.\n\nSome foreman out of Gavril's view blew a whistle and the mass of working men suddenly shifted forward. Gavril found himself swept along with the tide and into his new workplace, his heart full of cautious optimism as he and the other workers crossed the broad threshold. That optimism was quickly crushed as, while the exterior had been decorated with fancy trappings calling back to eras long gone with a modern, safe undercurrent, the interior of the foundry wasn't that different from what it was before. The furnace that had unexpectedly belched out flame like some ash-caked dragon and sent 4 men to the infirmary. The rickety stairway up to the second level that had been broken and repaired dozens of times, and with it many of his coworker's legs, ribs or skulls. The busted casting ladle that periodically leaked molten metal, burning the flesh of the operator.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, however. The doors, for one, could be opened from the inside in case of emergency. The wiring that kept the lights on was safely sealed inside the walls. There was a list of safety protocols, first aid tips or other useful information on every wall. But what relieved Gavril the most was the presence of enough gloves, masks, aprons and other safety tools to protect every man in the building. The machines may still be dangerous, but the madman has at least made a token effort towards safety. Still, Gavril did not feel much safer than he did before the city changed hands."

This is Boris Kelchev, I spoke with you the other day."\n\nRurik thoughts wandered to a question: How did this man get his personal number? That question was quickly answered for him, however, as the union boss carried on in his gravelly baritone,\n\n"Your son, Yuriy, gave me the number at the meeting, if you're wondering."\n\nOh, that's right, thought Rurik. He loved that boy, and understood the cause and the pain of the kingdom's working class, but damn if he didn't jump the gun every time there was an opportunity to help. "Too nice for his own good." Muttered Rurik inaudibly.\n\n"Oh yes, yes. It was wonderful meeting you - what are you calling to discuss?"\n\n"Well, really, I'm calling to thank you. I wasn't so sure about how sincere you were when you said you'd be strengthening the unions, but your reforms have really paid off! The boss is treating us far, far better, and accidents are down 20% because they're keeping the equipment clean and repaired. The union thanks you, King Rurik."\n\nThat put a smile on the old King's face; perhaps Yuriy had been right after all. The workers are the lifeblood of the kingdom, and they're better off than ever. Following a short exchange of goodbyes, Rurik put down the phone and laid his head back on the pillow, one thought on his mind."

Business leaders weren't happy with this situation, that much was clear, but they had been ordered not to disrupt strikes, and orders were to be followed. Their hands were tied, and there was nothing to be done about it.\n\nAfter hours of agonizing shutdown for the city, business leaders finally came to the strikers to negotiate, being greeted by boos and jeers and leaving with their heads down to the sound of cheers. Clearly, they had earned themselves few friends, and much animosity, among those who worked for them.

Long considered, by the Princess and her faction as politically suspect and unreliable, the dissolution of the councils was a clear victory for Lydia in the ever-continuing conflict with her brother.\n\nWith the Guilds so empowered, production and efficiency could be emphasized instead of worker discord and agitation, and at this Voznesensky could not help but feel content. The state was still surrounded by enemies and that, combined with the revolutionary sentiment that seemed endemic within Central Siberia, was something that had to be addressed, and not permitted to fester in established organizations.\n\nYes, he thought as he looked out over the long lines of workers standing and waiting to re-register, this was the better choice. Yuriy's counterproposal might have had value, but it also had more risk, and such risk could not be entertained.\n\nHe only wished that the Princess did not take such savage, and obvious, enjoyment in her 'victory.'"

Rising to his feet in his modest worker's apartment in Krasnoyarsk, the union boss had made the trek down 5 flights of stairs in a panic. His breathing heavy and labored by the time he got to the bottom of the steps, he stumbled out the front door of the building and stared across the street at the local steelworks in horror.\n\nThe setting sun tinted the sky around the square orange, and ochre shaded tear gas rose like a smokestack as striking workers scrambled in the street. The men cried out in pain, staggered in their blindness, held their soot stained shirts over their faces and coughed dry, bitter coughs. In front of the mass of terrified workers was a group of about 20 or so men- thugs, really, clad in makeshift riot gear and faceless gas masks. They formed a line around the area where the orderly protest had once been, but Boris noticed something shocking in particular. While some of those there were clearly strikebreakers hired by the guild that owned the factory, judging by the symbols plastered onto their gear, Boris also counted at least a dozen local police officers in the midst of the crowd.\n\n"How the hell can they let this happen?" Spat Boris, turning around to go into his apartment. As he climbed the stairs, still shocked from the site, he continued to mutter to himself.\n\n"That lying fat bastard, the madman pretends he's for the people and then lets this happen," Boris fumbled with his keys, got into his apartment, and walked over to the window and stared out into the city in a simmering rage.

Because each and every one of the soldiers was a woman, a member of the first expansion division of the Shieldmaidens. And there would be many more to come.\n\nIt had been hard, very hard, to convince some of the old generals and men of power in the state that the Shieldmaidens even had a legitimate purpose - let alone that they should be expanded - but she had prevailed. As usual. The proof was in front of her, and it heralded a great future, for with women being openly welcomed into the armed forces, the state's available manpower had nearly doubled.\n\nSuch expanded reserves had uses far beyond simply fighting on the front lines as well, as proven by the presence of General Anna Kotsur on the dais beside Lydia and the King. There would soon be more like her, the opportunities now available making sure that the potential of half of the state's citizens would not be wasted.\n\nYes, Lydia thought, this had been an important victory. More soldiers and more troops meant that the state could continue to expand and consolidate its territory, and subsequent security threats could be more easily addressed without compromising strength at the front.\n\nOf course, it also helped that all of the new Shieldmaidens well knew who had fought to afford them this opportunity, and how easily others might conspire to take it away.

"This looks... adequate."\n\n"Erm, 'adequate'? What do you mean?" The designer maintained a courteous smile, but there was evidence of exasperated panic in his voice.\n\n"Well, it's not very different from the old model, is it? All you did was fix up the engine, when you should be thinking bigger! I want you to see if you can fit a bigger gun and more armor on this thing."\n\n"Well, uh, all due respect, Your Majesty, but that wouldn't be practical for us at the moment. Tanks in this day and age tend to rely on speed rather than blunt force, and-"\n\nSuddenly, the King put a firm hand on the designer's shoulder, and he felt as though his heart stopped for a small instant. "Oh, nonsense. You're going to put more armor and more firepower on it, and you're going to make it work. Stop worrying about minute details and work with the same ethic that built this kingdom. If I was able to get this far without compromising in favor of practicality, so can you! "\n\nThe designer gulped.

As he had requested, the vehicle was equipped with a larger 115mm gun, and had rather characteristic composite armor kits along the turret.\n\nThe King turned to his son, with a smile on his face. "You see, Boris? I told you they'd make my tank. Look at it go!"\n\nBoris Krylov was much more reserved. "It is quite an impressive vehicle, Father, but aren't you concerned about the added price? The new additions aren't exactly cheap..."\n\n"This again? Those metal boxes are already ludicrously expensive as it is. A few more rubles isn't going to kill us." Rurik said, turning back to view the tank be put through its paces.\n\n"If you say so. Anyway, on a more pleasant note, I've heard the tankers have already given this thing a nickname. 'His Majesty's Eyebrows', they call it."\n\nRurik began to laugh. The name was no doubt referring to the bulky armor kits on the turret. "Hah! Isn't that somethingl?

Apparently, Rurik had taken an interest in his work with the Kamov Helicopter Design Bureau and wanted to meet him the very next day around noon. After an exchange of niceties, Kamov put Rurik on hold while he scrambled in the wee hours of the morning to schedule a last-minute meeting with the king. By 2, he had failed to book any kind of meeting space at the Bureau office, and instead would be meeting Rurik in the workshop. This was why, at noon, Nikolay Kamov was putting papers in order and a model on the table in a dusty workshop to meet a goddamn king on 10 hours of notice.\n\nRight as he made his last preparations, the door swung open and the old King hobbled his way in. Nikolay snapped to attention but was quickly dismissed by Rurik, "At ease, friend. I'd like to keep this informal, all I need is for you to tell me about your wondrous flying machines."\n\nNikolay raised an eyebrow at the term, but shrugged it off. The King had seen better days, surely. Offering the king a seat, Nikolay began taking his highness through the workings of the Bureau's latest design. Rurik was friendly and cordial, but quite frankly confused, as the craft, as well as its expenses, was explained. Almost every sentence, the king asked something absurdly ignorant, but Nikolay humored his questions with slight annoyance. Then, once done, awaited the king's response, who had been stroking his chin for the last few minutes of the pitch.\n\n"Fine work, young man." Rurik said, to the nearly 70 year old aeronautics engineer. Rurik smirked to himself, watching Nikolay's bewilderment, "Anyways, I think your Bureau would benefit from some funding from the crown. I'd like to put a few million rubles into this project, what do you say?"\n\nNikolay lit up, drumming his fingers across the table with excitement at the prospect. "We would welcome it, sir!

This took many hours, and at the end of it all Rurik was sure he had heard the same argument numerous times.\n\nWhen he asked them why this was, they reacted with horror. Each of their positions could not be more different than that of the other, they all claimed, saying they merely needed several more hours to make the distinctions clear. That was the wrong answer.\n\nAngered by what he now knew to be a colossal waste of time, he dismissed them back to their city and, within several minutes, signed a decree implementing his heir's suggestion.

The tone of the subjects being debated had been almost entirely positive in nature, and the members of the council felt entirely free to speak their minds. The ominous presence of the Kingsguard was gone entirely, as the masked men who coldly stood vigil over the chamber were absent. An air almost warm in nature began to take hold in the Zemsky Sobor, far different from the intimidating environment it presented in the past.\n\n"It is my belief that the formation of proper political associations would go great lengths towards ensuring healthy political discourse within the realm. With my father's blessing, I have already begun to work with several of my fellow council members to build the foundations of a truly democratic, parliamentarian kingdom. For too long we have lorded over our people, who were no better than slaves to royal authority. My friends, believe me when I say that we are on the road to creating a kingdom that serves the people, rather than ourselves"\n\nYuriy's speech, unsurprisingly, was met with overwhelming applause. There was little opposition to his plans of reform these days, and most of the Zemsky Sobor had already been convinced one way or the other that the prince had their best interests at heart. As the clapping continued, Yuriy glanced across the chamber at his sister. To the prince's surprise, Lydia had remained present through the entire meeting.\n\nLydia had clearly not shared the rest of the council's enthusiasm, but did not appear to have the usual look of quiet disgust. Yuriy's heart sank as their eyes met. She still appeared unconvinced of her brother's intentions, though, to his relief, the hatred was gone."

His sister was to govern the province of Magadan, a desolate icy hell far from the capital. "That was never my intention, Lydia. Magadan is in need of a governor, and you have proven yourself a highly capable administrator in the past...\n\n"What difference does that make? Magadan is a frozen wasteland! There's so few living there, the place practically runs itself!" The princess' passive-aggressive attitude was now teetering on the brink of blind rage. Her brother's excuse clearly was not what she wanted to hear.\n\nYuriy went silent for a moment, choosing his next words with care. "Lydia, listen. I know you must despise me for what I did, and there's nothing I can say to change that. At the end of the day, though, we are siblings. I still believe we can work past this political mess, because blood bonds are stronger than any ideological differences. We can come together again, but first I just need you to work with me. Can you find it in your heart to do so?"\n\nHer brother's words gave Lydia much to think about. "I suppose. I'll try my best, Yuriy, just don't forget about me." The prince responded by offering a handshake, which quickly became a hug.\n\n"I still love you, sister. Nothing will ever change that.""

Yet, that demand had seemingly blown up in his face. The Sobor had erupted into chaos. The bickering of the ministers increased to absurd levels as men shouted over each other. Those who lent closer to Lidya's ideas looked on smugly as the Sobor degenerated. In their eyes, it proved the necessity of his sister's methods.\n\nYuriy tried to bring order back to the council, his gavel struck thrice, but he was summarily ignored. He looked over to his co-chair only to realize that he was already shouting in the face of another member of the council. Yuriy felt his anger rising as he was ignored once again in his call to order. Few things had ever managed to raise his hackles quite this much, in all honesty, the only thing he had been so angry at before was his sister.\n\nFinally, he could take it no more and his patience snapped. "Shut the fuck up all of you! Sit down and shut the fuck up!" his voice nearly cracked from the force of his yells. The bureaucrats, and even Yuriy himself, were shocked into silence. The remainder of the session passed by in an awkward quiet, but already he could see the whispers of the bureaucrats and the glances sent his way by his co-chair.

He returned their greetings as warmly as was possible, and began.\n\nThe negotiations, mostly to secure their votes and support - public or otherwise - across the various ministries, councils, and organizations over which they held sway, were exhausting. The men were, after all, no friend to the common citizen, otherwise they would not have supported his sister for so long. But they were also keenly aware of their own exposure, and were thus motivated to attach themselves to him. And, so, in the end an agreement was reached.\n\nYuriy was under no illusions that the situation was resolved. They would support him for now, but they did not truly believe in his efforts, and more compromises and overtures on his part would be needed to maintain that support. He sighed in frustration.

But it was also easily the most well-developed port in all of Siberia, and thus the state's primary method of external trade. And that meant it was a place of power. It was currently small. Unorganized. It would not be once she was through with it. Once she arranged the shipping schedules. Once she replaced the complacent bureaucrats. Once she imposed real hierarchy. Real security.
