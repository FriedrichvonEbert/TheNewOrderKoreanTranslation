 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_RURIK_II_DESC:0 "니콜라이 이바노비치 크릴로프 소장은 한때 붉은 군대의 장교로, 세바스토폴과 보로실로프그라드 등지의 전투들에서 62군의 참모장을 맡았습니다. 그러나 대조국전쟁이 그저 소련의 막대한 패배가 되먼서, 크릴로프는 몸과 마음이 모두 다쳤고, 끊임없는 퇴각의 스트레스가 신경쇠약으로 이어졌습니다. 그러나 62군은 이미 붕괴되었기에, 그의 고통에 영향을 받지는 않았습니다. 부대가 없는 그와 일단의 장교들은 우랄 산맥을 넘어 쏟아지는 난민의 물결에 합류해 동쪽으로 향했고, 결국 중앙 시베리아 공화국에서 그의 상관들을 발견했습니다. 공화국은 시베리아 흑군이라는 무정부주의자 반란을 해결하기 위해 크릴로프를 파견했으나, 그는 굴욕적인 패배를 당했고, 나중에는 그가 믿었던 부하 중 하나인 안드레예프 장군에게 크라스노야르스크에서 배신당했고, 부대를 케메로보로 퇴각시킬 수 밖에 없었습니다. 그 곳에서, 그는 자신의 고통과 죄책감을 무디게 하기 위해서, 손에 넣을 수 있는 것이라면 무엇이든 마시고 피워, 더 깊은 인사불성 상태에 빠졌습니다.\n\n그러나 어느 날, 갑자기 변화가 일어났습니다. 담배 한 갑과 보드카 세 병, 그리고 정교회 신비주의 서적만을 가지고 벌거벗은 채 방에 처박혀있던 한 저녁이 지나고, 그는걸어나와 러시아를 재통합하라는 명령을 받았다고 선포하였습니다. 누구로부터? 그에 대한 대답은 없었습니다. 그의 지휘관 동지들은 그의 정신상태를 우려했고, 크릴로프가 스스로를 '류리크 2세, 황제이자 전 루스의 군주'로 선언하자 그들의 공포는 가중되었습니다. 그러나, 그들의 우려는 정복과 영광의 약속에 끌린 병사들과 용병들로부터의 지지의 물결에 압도당했습니다.\n\n류리크 2세는 러시아 전통주의와 소비에트 군국주의의 절충적 혼합을 설파합니다. 그는 차르주의 전통의 후계자임을 주장하면서도, 로마노프 가문을 경멸합니다; 그는 블라디미르 1세의 미덕에 대해 이야기하면서도, 그 자신은 무신론자이며 성직자들을 "사기꾼에 마술사들"이라고 일축합니다. 그의 잡탕 사상은 그의 지지자들로 대표되는데, 그들은 반동주의자들, 소련의 참전용사들, 그리고 용병들이 뒤섞인 집단입니다. 그의 장교단 내의 몇몇 사람들은 이 모든 "류리크"같은 행동이 농민들의 지지를 얻어내기 위한 가식이 아닐지 의심합니다; 만약 그렇다고 한다면, 그는 캐릭터를 굉장히 잘 유지하고 있다 하겠습니다."

 POLITICS_KING_YURIY_DESC:0 "만약 유리 니콜라예비치 크릴로프에게 당신이 언젠가 되살아난 러시아 군주정의 지도자가 될 것이라 20년 전에 말했다면, 그는 의심할 여지 없이 이를 전혀 믿지 않았을 것입니다. 그럼에도, 실로 기이한 일련의 사건들을 통해, 유리는 아버지의 거의 영웅적인 유산의 확고한 계승자로 떠올랐습니다.\n\n젊은 시절, 유리는 아버지의 뒤를 이어 중앙 시베리아 공화국군에 장교로 입대하였고, 정력적이고 능력 있는 지도자로 두각을 나타냈습니다. 전선에 있는 동안, 그는 러시아의 가난하고 사회적으로 불리한 사람들에게 미치는 전쟁의 매우 파괴적인 효과를 직접 목도했습니다. 계속해서 진급하면서도, 유리는 인민의 이름으로 진정한 변화를 만들 수 없는 그의 무력함에 좌절했습니다.\n\n유리의 삶은 곧 그의 아버지가 중증 신경쇠약처럼 보이는 것을 앓게 되자 더욱 정신없어졌습니다. 그가 류리크 2세로 다시 나타났을 때, 그는 빠르게 자신의 자녀를 그의 자칭 왕국의 귀족으로 앉혔습니다. 잠시 혼란과 아버지에 대한 걱정의 시간을 보내고 나서, 유리 왕자는 마침내 왕국을 자신의 이상을 실현시킬 기회로 인식하게 되었습니다. 왕관을 향한 길은 정치적 음모로 가득했지만, 이러한 도전들에도 불구하고 결국 유리는 류리크 2세의 정당한 후계자로 불리게 되었습니다.\n\n이제 작고한 그의 아버지를 기려 류리크 3세라는 이름으로 즉위한 왕은 그의 고귀한 목표들을 이루고자 합니다. 그의 통치 하에서, 류리크 3세는 인민의 권리를 가장 먼저, 그리고 가장 중요하게 여기는, 더 공정하고 정의로운 왕국을 위한 기반을 놓으려 합니다."

 POLITICS_QUEEN_LYDIA_DESC:0 "From the chaos and confusion of the Russian warlord era arises Rogneda I, the Wolf Queen of Rus'. The woman formerly known as Lydia Krylova's rise to power was nothing short of meteoric, and she now stands tall as the most powerful authority of the resurrected Russian nation.\n\nIt was not always destined to be like this. Once upon a time, Lydia was a volunteer nurse helping with the rear echelon of the Central Siberian Republic's military. What she witnessed during her time shaped her character dramatically: countless men and women putting their lives on the line for causes they did not fully understand, without any indication that their sacrifices were making a difference. Russia was dying, and this could not be more tangible to Lydia, who was able to witness the effects of these death throes with her own eyes.\n\nWhen her father emerged from his mental lapse as Rurik II, Lydia immediately saw this as her opportunity to turn the tide. As the Kingdom's power continued to grow, so too did the Wolf Princess'. Eventually, she was forced to compete with her own brother for the throne, but her passionate and ruthless drive saw Lydia through to take his place as Rurik II's rightful heir.\n\nNewly reborn as Queen Rogneda, she intends to restore strength and honor to the wounded Russia nation, no matter what the cost may be."

 KEM_esoteric_kingdom:0 "난해한 왕국"
 KEM_esoteric_kingdom_desc:0 "루리크 2세는 모든 반역자들과 신성한 러시아의 모든 약탈자들이 멸망하는 것을 보고자 하는 열망으로 불타는 사람입니다. 보통은, 이 산산조각이 난 우리 땅에 이런 사람이 필요할 겁니다. 하지만 그의 정신상태는 그로 하여금 어떤 것을 발전시키게 했습니다. 조국복원이 어떻게 진행되어야 하는지에 대한 흥미로운 생각들 입니다. 어떤 사람들은 그의 추진력에서 희망과 영감을 발견할지 모르지만, 그의 이웃들은 대부분 미친 놈으로만 볼 것입니다."
 
 KEM_the_two_wolves:0 "두 늑대"
 KEM_the_two_wolves_desc:0 "국왕 전하의 두 자제분이신 유리, 리디아 두 분께선 모두 훌륭하신 고문이자 행정가이시지만, 두 분은 서로 다른 방향으로 통치하시길 원하십니다. 유리 저하께선 좀 더 가볍고 포퓰리즘적인 접근법을 선호하시며, 전하께 신민들이 스스로의 운명을 결정할 수 있는 힘을 가질 수 있게 허하라 촉구하시고 계십니다.\n\n반면 리디아 공주는 군국주의적이고 위계적인 이상을 따르십니다. 공주저하께선 평민들 중 어느 누구도 자신의 어깨에 짐을 지기에 적합하지 않다며 전하께서 군을 가까이하고 평민들을 멀리할 것을 촉구하시고 계십니다."

 KEM_kings_unions:0 "왕의 조합"
 KEM_kings_unions_desc:0 "In a bizarre symbiosis of the ancient ways of the Rus and the modern ideals of the Bolsheviks, King Rurik has declared that trade unions will be free to operate within reason. This has, surprisingly, served the King well, as the peasants who might otherwise call for his overthrow are now placated by their state-sponsored Unions. However, if the people are given a taste of freedom, who knows where it may lead them?"

 KEM_kings_unions_2:0 "강화된 왕국 조합"
 KEM_kings_unions_2_desc:0 "Following national developments, the trade unions operating within the state have been strengthened, and operate with even fewer restrictions or oversight than before. Workers and union officials have indicated their pleasure at these developments, confident that they represent their King's concern for their situation."

 KEM_kings_unions_3:0 "족쇄가 풀린 왕국 조합"
 KEM_kings_unions_3_desc:0 "Trade unions within the state have been nearly entirely unshackled, operating with a freedom uncommon outside of ostensibly socialist states. Workers across the nation rejoice, extremely pleased that their King cares enough about their conditions to permit their association."

 KEM_unions_subdued:0 "제압된 왕국 조합"
 KEM_unions_subdued_desc:0 "The Royal Unions have been subdued, with their rights restricted and with more stringent regulations imposed upon them. Workers across the nation are, understandably, quite upset at this development, while others insist that they simply do not understand that the state has more productive ideas in mind for their organization."

 KEM_unions_subdued2:0 "왕국 길드"
 KEM_unions_subdued2_desc:0 "The Royal Unions have been restructured into the Royal Guilds. These institutions will ensure that the workers over which they exercise oversight are working harmoniously in support of the state and its goals. As a secondary function, they also manage workforce concerns to the greatest degree reasonably possible without impeding efficiency."

 KEM_idea_raising_an_army:0 "군대 양성"
 KEM_idea_raising_an_army_desc:0 "군의 규모를 빠르게 확대하기 위한 노력으로 징병제가 왕국에 도입 되었습니다. 물론 이것은 국가의 많은 적들에 대한 적절한 안보를 보장 하기 위해 필요하지만, 국민들에게 극도로 인기가 없으며, 이는 정부의 정치적인 노력을 방해 할 것 입니다."

 KEM_revolutionary_king:0 "혁명가 왕"
 KEM_revolutionary_king_desc:0 "유리 왕자의 요청으로, 류리크 왕의 혁명적인 과거와 붉은 군대에서의 봉사는 국가 선전 분야에서 강조 되어 왔습니다. 그렇게 함으로써 이상에 대한 국가의 헌신은 강화 될 것이고, 국민들은 왕이 모범을 보이는 것을 보게 될 것 입니다."

 KEM_a_new_sobor:0 "새로운 삼부회"
 KEM_a_new_sobor_desc:0 "개혁을 계속하면서, 젬스키 소보르는 점점 더 많은 권한을 부여 받았고, 국가기능에 관한 다양한 권한을 부여 받았습니다. 궁극적으로 국가가 민주적인 의회 군주국으로의 전환을 촉진하기 위한 이 조치는 국민에 대한 이러한 헌신을 결정적으로 입증하는 역할을 해줍니다."

 KEM_militarist_king:0 "군국주의자 왕"
 KEM_militarist_king_desc:0 "At the behest of Princess Lydia, King Rurik's military triumphs in past service, against both the Germans and the insurgent anarchists of the Black Army, have been emphasized in state propaganda. In doing so, the people will see that the state remains surrounded by enemies, and that a powerful and expanded military is necessary."

 KEM_a_new_hierarchy:0 "새로운 계급제"
 KEM_a_new_hierarchy_desc:0 "Continuing reforms, Princess Lydia has decreed her intention to establish a new social order, and thus a societal hierarchy. Naturally, military officers and noble aristocrats are positioned at the top – such is the only correct course of action, after all as, absent proper leadership, how can anything of note be accomplished?"

 KEM_kingsguard_supremacy:0 "근위대 우선"
 KEM_kingsguard_supremacy_desc:0 "The Kingsguard has expanded its influence on the state's political affairs at the behest of Princess Lydia, with many of its officers accepting positions of importance overseen by her faction in the pursuit of future wealth, status, and glory."

 KEM_kingsguard_academy:0 "근위대 학교"
 KEM_kingsguard_academy_desc:0 "In an effort to ensure that the state's future army is led by properly trained and professional officers, the Kingsguard Academy has been established. It is expected that the positive effects of this professionalization will be observed within the military in short order."

 KEM_pride_of_the_king:0 "Pride of the King"
 KEM_pride_of_the_king_desc:0 "United behind their King, the state's military is motivated, enthusiastic, and eager to march in support of his goals and political vision. Though the soldiery is well aware that challenges will be faced, they are just as equally confident that their King will guide them to eventual victory."

 KEM_the_peoples_guard:0 "시민의 근위대"
 KEM_the_peoples_guard_desc:0 "At Prince Yuriy's insistence, the Kingsguard has been disbanded and replaced with the People's Guard, a force that he, and many others, consider to be far less concerned with their own position and primacy, and more concerned with the protection of the state and its citizenry."

 KEM_ship_expansion:0 "왕립함대 구축"
 KEM_ship_expansion_desc:0 "With the acquisition of a coastline, the state has committed to the construction of a number of warships in order to patrol and secure its territorial waters. Targeted investments have been made in order to ensure rapid production."

 KEM_trade_deals:0 "수익성 있는 무역거래"
 KEM_trade_deals_desc:0 "Promoting economic expansion, the state has sent diplomats to many foreign countries to both negotiate favorable trade deals and invite foreign businesses to establish operations. These efforts cannot but generate lucrative rewards."

 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king:0 "미친 왕의 통치"
 KEM_reign_of_the_mad_king_desc:0 "Nikolay Krylov, now known as Rurik the Second, has so far proved to be an exceptionally eccentric ruler. His rule thus far has demonstrated his continuous ability to contradict himself on several subjects, and few believe that this ability will end any time soon. The Mad King has also decided upon strengthening the military in order to strike out against our neighbors, which he sees as rebellious subjects.\n\nThere is clearly plenty the King has to do before he can embark on the warpath. The King's children are both attempting to persuade His Highness to follow their visions for how to prepare the kingdom for the future wars. Judgments will have to be made on whether to follow the populist policies of Prince Yuriy or the brutal pragmatism of Princess Lydia.\n\nRurik will need to determine the direction of the economy, the army and the society he wishes to establish. Once these challenges have been overcome, we can set out on the warpath."

 KEM_the_kings_industry:0 "왕의 산업"
 KEM_the_kings_industry_desc:0 "After the past deterioration of our standing in the region, it was assumed that we were doomed to obscurity due to our complete lack of fortune. Or so it seemed, after all we still control the industrious city of Kemerovo.\n\nIf we were to utilize and advance the output of the city, producing new guns and equipment, equipping freshly trained soldiers and extending these plans to enhance our infrastructure, improving the mobility of our army and workers.\n\nMaybe we could once again take our place as a relevant contender in the region under the ambitious King Rurik II."

 KEM_support_the_unions:0 "조합을 지원하라"
 KEM_support_the_unions_desc:0 "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nCrown Yuriy Krylov has expressed his support for the existing trade unions, emphasizing how expansion of our output will never be sustainable without the support of the workers in the factories.\n\nThis choice will pose a bizarre conflict to the new monarchy which his majesty has created, but such an unusual contradiction will be nothing new to those who know the king."

 KEM_the_will_of_the_people:0 "국민의 뜻"
 KEM_the_will_of_the_people_desc:0 "Now that His Highness has determined on following a more progressive approach to our economy, we shall endeavour to begin laying out the new foundations of our supportive economy.\n\nNew legislation will be put into place to protect the rights of the kingdom's loyal and diligent industrial workers and unions will be strengthened. Popular policies like these will be necessary if we are to keep our working classes devoted to the cause of the king.\n\nFor the will of the people shall not be ignored for as long as King Rurik is around to hear it."

 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king:0 "그리고 왕의 힘"
 KEM_and_the_power_of_the_king_desc:0 "His Highness has heard the outcry of the people and he has listened, our recent attempts at restructuring the economy have proved very popular with the poorer members of our society.\n\nImprovements in the conditions of workers have already begun to improve, along with popular support for the king's rule. But if these trends are to continue, power will have to remain in the hands of the king, after all his grace has proved himself to be a worthy leader of the working classes.\n\nThe cooperation of the people with the authority of the monarch will be required if our economy is to improve."

 KEM_a_change_in_course:0 "경로 변경하기"
 KEM_a_change_in_course_desc:0 "Following the decision made by His Highness on the employment of the industry of Kemerovo, it is obvious that we should set about expanding our production, but what remains unanswered is how this will be enacted.\n\nPrincess Lydia Krylova has planned to set out a proposal to the economic minister, Lev Voznesensky, which would undermine the current rights of workers, but significantly increase the extent of our production. After all, trade unions and collective action will only serve their own interests and oppose the greater aspirations of the king. If we were to put these plans into action, the king may lose the support of the workers in the future.\n\nWe must hope they can see the kingdom's true potential."

 KEM_lean_right:0 "오른쪽으로"
 KEM_lean_right_desc:0 "The time has come to break with the outdated economic system that our kingdom currently upholds, unions and worker's rights have proven only to be obstacles to our economic potential.\n\nRemoving these laws and significantly reducing the power of the unions, will certainly benefit our short term output and remove a substantial amount of power from the hands of the union leaders. But we continue to run the risk of antagonizing the working classes, as they still believe that the old system works best for them.\n\nRegardless of this risk, we shall push ahead with the necessary reforms to unleash our as yet unrealized economic potential."

 KEM_a_truly_free_market:0 "진정한 자유시장"
 KEM_a_truly_free_market_desc:0 "Following the success of our recent reforms to the economy, it is obvious that we should continue to pursue the plan put forward by Princess Lydia and liberate the markets from its remaining restrictions.\n\nState intervention will be limited and the last of the unions will be muzzled, in order to create an environment for a truly free market.\n\nSoon we will only need to wait for the inevitable boost to the efficiency of our industry that will inevitably arrive, establishing a great advantage over our surrounding enemies."

 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age:0 "현대 시대를 위한 경제"
 KEM_an_economy_for_the_modern_age_desc:0 "We have, at long last, completed the necessary reforms to our industry that will develop a suitable base for future production. The direction of the royal economy has ultimately been decided, for better or for worse, the days of our ineffective economy are gone, and Kemerovo has truly become home to an economy fit for the modern age. The extra capacity that our changes have brought will prove instrumental to our future prospects in the region.\n\nHis Majesty is pleased with the kingdom's progress, there is now a lot less holding back the King's immense ambitions."

 KEM_the_kings_society:0 "왕의 사회"
 KEM_the_kings_society_desc:0 "The order of the kingdom's society is yet to be determined, two clear options from His Highnesses' children have emerged. First, the ideals of Prince Yuriy, which would remarkably improve the political rights of the people of Kemerovo and promote equality amongst the population.\n\nAlternatively, Princess Lydia offers a more pragmatic vision of Kemerovo's society, which would entail closer links with the military and an enforcement of a strict hierarchy to ensure stability.\n\nWhoever King Rurik decides to follow, will have an increase in their power and influence within the realm."

Following this great triumph, Rurik II has gone so far as to declare himself King of Siberia to commemorate this significant milestone in the quest to reunify Russia.\n\nHis daughter, the shrewd Princess Lydia, has risen to become the chosen heir to Rurik II's coveted legacy. Even now, she stands at her father's side as his top advisor, guiding his hand towards the establishment of a stronger kingdom than ever before. Princess Lydia envisions a kingdom with a strictly-enforced hierarchy; a supremely powerful state invulnerable to enemies from within and without.\n\nThe end of Russia's dark age is close at hand. The journey may not be over just yet, but Princess Lydia will ensure that it is seen to its long-awaited completion."

 KEM.1.t:0 "The King in Kemerovo"
 KEM.1.desc:0 "Sergei walked up the long and heavily decorated stairs leading into the Grand Palace of Kemerovo, the residence of the great Rurik the Second and his family. He could not help but notice the signs of destruction from the days of the Siberian War in what used to be the local Gorkom headquarters. Thankfully, the new rulers of the land had gone to great lengths to hastily repair the building. The Rurikid ensign was visible in every object and wall, often simply replacing the hammer and sickle, and more than likely bolstering the ego of General Nikolay Krylov. Modern comforts were combined with medieval architecture in an unexpected way.\n\n"You shall have an audience with His Majesty in precisely two hours", was the response of the secretary. Until then, Sergei could admire the wonderful artwork and furniture, occasionally peeking out of the window to enjoy the view of the central square - even though the arrival of winter discouraged many from spending time there.\n\nAt exactly twelve o'clock, the wooden doors of the palace opened, and Sergei entered the King's residence not as a noble or a general, but a mere businessman. On an expensive throne, Rurik II sat and observed the economist with a judging look. Just as all the dozens of other men to have entered the room, Sergei truly had to prove his value to the mad king and his advisors. Undisturbed by the situation he was in, he outlined his plan of economic development and won the trust of the Royal Court, which seemed open to inviting him again. For all the rumours of him being an insane and brutal king, Rurik seemed awfully logical and pragmatic in person.\n\nThe man left the Palace, unsure if the story of Kemerovo's Tsar was a farce or a tragedy. Either way, that did not have an impact on the situation on the ground: the state was surrounded by enemies, and the choice of siding with the General was dangerous to make. Yet that did not stop some of his more affectionable subjects from doing just that."

He spoke softly, yet firmly, and seemed exactly of sound mind even while addressing himself as Tsar; or firmly insisting he be called Rurik II to everyone who called General Krylov by his old name.\n\nOccasionally, the servants mused amongst themselves about the king whilst he roamed the palace or resided on his throne. Was he truly mad? Was this what the horrors of war brought? No, others argued. The General is merely putting on an act to confuse and bewilder others. Yet, all of them knew the others had no concrete answer. The Tsar certainly gave none.\n\nWhat of it, then? If they were following a lunatic, he was a benevolent one who treated them well. If they were following a man talented enough to put on such an act, then clearly they were working for one of the greatest minds in Siberia. These thoughts at least, put them at ease as the breaks ended, or the Tsar called for them.\n\nYet still, the question lingered."

Rurik decided to steer towards something all of them would enjoy, the unification of Central Siberia under him as King.\n\nIt wasn't long until Lydia decided to take the conversation in a different direction though. "If we want to unify the region, the military needs even more funding, Father. We need to make sure we conquer our enemies swiftly before any of them can put up a strong resistance."\n\n"What are you talking about Lydia", Yuriy said, opposed to anything she said. "More has to be done for our subjects, not the military. Besides, should we not try to approach things diplomatically first?"\n\n"Are you that naive, brother?" Lydia responded coldly. "Do you really think the surrounding warlords will just let us peacefully integrate them? The Germans will just hand back Moscow?\n\nYuriy stuttered, to the delight of Lydia, "No-I..."\n\n"Be quiet! Both of you!" King Rurik interjected, angry that nothing had changed between them, despite all his efforts. "I brought you here so you could finally get along. For the sake of the Kingdom, just end your bickering. Boris, you haven't said much, what do you think we should do next?"\n\nBoris looked to his two siblings, both angrily eyeing him as he prepared to speak. "I don't know, father. Whatever sounds best to you."\n\nYuriy and Lydia restarted their arguing match, both trying to get their point across.

It would hurt them, he said, as the economy reoriented and as some inefficient and unviable industries closed down. At that, she spoke, perhaps more to herself than to him.

Combined with additional sponsoring and funding of pro-Rurikid artists and politicians, Prince Yuriy attempted to sideline republican sentiment through peaceful means primarily, only using violence as a last resort."

She was quick to strip the former police of Tomsk of their weapons, replacing them with loyal Kemerovo soldiers, and any dissent was crushed with force.\n\nHowever, all rulers need allies to survive. Lydia, long a proponent of the creation of a new aristocracy, found her allies in the industrialists of Tomsk. She stacked her administration with these wealthy industrialists, subsidizing their factories and businesses, and having them don the same decorum as the rest of Kemerovo's Royal Court. Lydia's goal as Governor was to make Tomsk a productive asset of King Rurik's realm, so that he may better be able to unite Russia, as is his destiny.\n\nAs part of making Tomsk a productive asset to the King, Lydia also funded infrastructure. She ensured that the roads were safe and well-maintained, that factories were functioning at full-capacity, and that the administration was loyal and well-disciplined. She also funded hospitals, as a healthy populace was a productive populace, and the invasion of Tomsk had overwhelmed what remained of its previous health infrastructure.

Novosibirsk, led by Alexander Pokryshkin, the Siberian Falcon, now served King Rurik in his conquests with its vast industry, population, and resources. The People's Revolutionary Council had been defeated, the socialist cause taking yet another blow. Tomsk, the last remnants of the Central Siberian Republic, now a loyal subject under the King.\n\nWith all of Central Siberia now united under the King of Rus, King Rurik is now a powerful contender for uniting all of Russia, as unlikely as it may have seemed once upon a time. King Rurik's eccentric persona, beloved by the common people, is now well known across both Russia, and even the international community. Who knows what the future holds for this glorious realm, now that it may very well hold the fate of all of Russia in its hands. Of course, King Rurik's dreams are not yet achieved, and other contenders still threaten His Majesty and his realm from both the east and west. The Grand Principality of Central Siberia is not safe yet.\n\nMany spectators have called King Rurik mad, and laughed at his dream of uniting Russia.

You have brought peace to this region, Nikolai Ivanovich."\n\nRurik sighed. "Aye, but not elsewhere. There will be more battles, and blood and death shall be left in their wake. Such is the price of reforging our homeland.\n\n"Russia is disparate, Matvey Kuzmich, and her people need something-someone-in whom they can place their trust." He smiled wryly at his old friend.

"Andreev was of the military, sworn to defend the people of this land." Rurik says this solemnly, going on in solemn conviction, "Yet the military turned on the people once the Germans bested them. The President-General was as a tyrant with no legitimacy, and no doubt did terrible things."\n\nThe people listen with cautious eyes and the bars seem to lift somewhat as the King assures them that they in better hands now, 'that the King, the Tsar, will bring peace and prosperity to Russia with all his people in harmony'. While there are murmurs here and there that dissent, Rurik simply speaks with plain sincerity. The unlikely-looking King on his dais speaking to the crowds gets much right, but much wrong – yet the sincerity bleeds through nonetheless. The people may, in fact, be in good hands.\n\n'You have labored under a tyrant' says the King, and the people murmur at that, 'But we will feed and clothe you, and we will aid the needy' – and the people's murmurs turn cautiously hopeful."

While receiving emissaries is not entirely unusual in of itself, the man who approached us today was anything but the usual kind of ambassador.\n\nHe claimed to be an emissary on behalf of "King Rurik II, Tsar and Autocrat of all Rus", and his realm which supposedly is based out of a major city in the Russian region of Central Siberia. This claim can be corroborated with reports from the CIA, who confirm that there has indeed been a dramatic shift of the balance of power in the region. While they still do not have a clear picture of the situation, the implication suggests that this "Rurik II" may very well have become a powerful new player in the Russian game.\n\nMonarchist movements are nothing new to Russia, but we have so far been unable to find any man by the name of Rurik who holds a claim to the throne. Stranger still was the ambassador's appearance. Diplomatic officials who were present to witness the meeting described his attire as "straight out of a renaissance fair" and "worthy of a Halloween costume".\n\nEstablishment of diplomatic relations with this "Rurik" could provide much needed information on the dire situation in Russia, and his regime could potentially serve as a key partner for our potential strategic interests in the region. After all, who are we to turn down friendly ties in times like these? On the other hand, more skeptical minds in the State Department are suggesting that the whole thing is merely an elaborate hoax, and should be ignored..."

The new Foreign Minister was so consumed with his work that he had initially failed to notice that a figure had shuffled into his office. Pyotr pulled his attention away from the paperwork and towards his guest. He immediately recognized the exhausted man as one of his ambassadors.\n\n"Ah, Yevgeny! I apologize, I was so busy I didn't see you there. My vision must be getting worse with age. How was your trip to the States?"\n\n"It was incredible, Pyotr! You should have seen the wonders they had there, you wouldn't believe it unless you saw it. They had these brightly-lit buildings that you could drive right up to and order the most amazing meals, almost like a giant food stall. I could hardly-"\n\n"Yes, yes, but I was actually wondering how your meeting with the Americans went?"\n\n"Oh, of course. The Americans would be honored to establish formal diplomatic relations with the realm as soon as possible. As we speak, my people are working out the details with Washington over our new embassy."\n\n"Excellent work, Yevgeny. His Majesty will be pleased, no doubt." Pyotr didn't show it, but the success of the mission caused him great elation. He wasn't so sure in the past, but the old architect was beginning to think that perhaps he had a real talent for diplomacy's cutthroat games after all."

Clearly encouraged by our attitude towards his so-called kingdom, his diplomats have reached out through official channels to make a request. There is no doubt now that this is not a mere hoax, but a legitimate effort by a Russian faction to strengthen ties with the United States.\n\nThe "king" wishes to attract American business to his growing realm, and wants us to make a significant financial investment in Central Siberia to pique the interest of our businesses in the region and its potential benefits. This request is not to be taken lightly, and represents an important crossroads for relations with the bizarre Russian regime.\n\nWhile the Russian diplomats assure us that an investment would be of great benefit to both parties, some of our economists are not nearly as idealistic and consider the prospect a waste of America's valuable resources. How shall we proceed?"

This time, it appears he is trying to undergo some kind of effort to industrialize his realm, and needs help doing so in a timely, efficient manner.\n\nThis is where we come in. Rurik II is under the impression that certain experts in the matters of industry who currently reside in the US could put their talents to use helping with his industrialization drive. He requests that we send some to Central Siberia to support these efforts, and assures that we will be well-compensated for our show of good faith.\n\nWhile this would surely help with strengthening relations with Rurik II's regime and continue to support a friendly face in Russia, some of our officials have pointed out that the situation in Russia is still quite dangerous and sending Americans to this war-torn country would put their lives in unnecessary danger.

While this reasoning is not entirely unfounded, it is still disappointing nonetheless.\n\nOur factories will simply have to make do without the industrial expertise of the Americans.

Their introduction was as rude as it was bizarre, after all, the rule of the Rurik dynasty over Russia had ended well over four centuries ago. Yet there they stood, impatiently waiting for their assumed meeting.\n\nApart from the initial confusion caused by their arrival, the ambassadors were ushered into the office of the Foreign Secretary.

His astonishment was only heightened when he learnt that they had succeeded in their task. They had forged a diplomatic connection with the empire in the east; such news, Baranovsky assumed, could only be good for the future of the kingdom he served.\n\nYet, as so often the case was for the Foreign Minister, there was plenty more work to be done.

Revealing a few faces that had become oddly familiar to the workers inside. They were the faces of the ambassadors of Rurik II, since they had been relocated into a more permanent location, they now sought to come to an agreement on Japanese investment. An offer which was readily accepted.\n\nThe Japanese ministers present needed little reminding of the hidden wealth of Siberia, which they knew would be fabulously profitable to exploit. The impeccably efficient techniques and machines of the Zaibatsu would only allow for more wealth to be generated. Such a result would only serve to benefit both sides.\n\nYet the risks of investing in such a volatile region remained heavy on the minds of both parties. Any investment at such a stage in time would surely be a gamble, prone to the many changes that were yet to shake Siberia.\n\nThe Russians were dismissed soon after and told to wait for an official response. All that was left for the Foreign Minister to do was make one."

Royals, politicians, and mine owners together shared in their ready anticipation of the riches that would soon follow. They could barely wait for their land to be made rich from foreing investment; fortunately for them, they did not have to suffer their impatience for long.\n\nVarious giant metal machines were to be carried across the Siberian plains until they were installed and left to stand, unmoving, to churn at the earth beneath them and uncover its hidden richness. In time all that will remain of such brutal efficiency will be scarred and empty land.\n\nHowever, these thoughts were not present for those in power. They knew that wealth was needed to better the lives of the king's subjects. Besides, it would be more practical for them to accept Japan's assistance as there are still more benefits that could be made from keeping them close."

The Foreign Secretary continued to try and find a way in which he could assure the king that future cooperation would not be ruled out.\n\nYet no matter which way he constructed what he was going to say he could not undermine the fact that the kingdom would be worse off for the lack of investment. Many would be left unemployed and the states finances would be much worse off as a result.\n\nIn the end all Baranovsky could come up with was the assurance that one day Siberia's vast wealth would be uncovered. For now the expanse of land under his highness's domain will remain undisturbed, but when it is inevitably exploited, the king's subjects will be richer for it."

He thought it better to keep it more authentic than diplomatic.\n\nRurik found the start of his writing the hardest, he had no idea where to begin let alone how to conclude the damned thing. Yet as the night went on, and the bottle on his desk got emptier, he realised that the words flowed from his pen with ease.\n\nBy the time he had scrawled his name at the bottom of the page he was quietly impressed with his efforts. Such length and such style could have only been the work of his genius. He did not bother to reanalyse what he wrote, instead he had it sealed and sent off right away.\n\nBaranovsky was quite taken aback once he had learnt of the news that the king had sent off the declaration without first requesting him to read over it. He might have complained, but he knew better than to question his royal highnesses judgement. The Foreign Secretary knew that all he could do was hope."

He returned it into the envelope and decided against carrying it to the emperor personally, better not bother him with such trivialities. Besides he would like to read more of it, and he would have had it not been so awfully written, and in russian.\n\nInstead he found a translator who might have been able to read the appalling work easier than he had. Yet the translator struggled enormously with this task, the phrases were muddled, the word choices bizarre and the punctuation non-existent. Try as he might he could not decipher what was written, he even began to question whether it had been written in some other foreign language he had not heard of. The only part he could confidently decode was the name signed at the bottom:\n\n"Rurik II, Tsar and Autocrat of All Rus"\n\nThe foreign minister turned to the translator and asked:"

They went on to outline how the Tsar would like to establish a warm diplomatic relation with them, for the benefit of both of their lands.\n\nThe Kazakh officials agreed that such an arrangement would be beneficial to the peace and prosperity of both sides.

Diplomatic relations with the Kazakh government would certainly lessen the amount of bloodshed in the future.

Then one day he collapsed at a meeting, having to be rushed to his room by his own generals. Despite expert care it soon became apparent to everyone the King was dying.\n\nThe King awoke one last time, finding himself surrounded by his family. His children at his bedside. Yurily and Lydia even putting aside their differences at least for the day. He hoped it would last, that they would finally come together as a family. Perhaps they were too far gone, but perhaps not. Regardless, it was not his heir he spoke to, for he had said all that needed to be said to them days ago. It was Boris, the one among them who never had aspirations beyond duty and family.\n\n"Tell me, are the people happy? Is our Kingdom strong enough?" The old king's voice was barely more than a whisper.\n\nBoris smiled. "Yes father, the Kingdom is strong. You've prepared us well for what's to come."\n\nRurik nodded, wiping the sweat from his brow. "Good, good. Then this whole charade was worth it in the end."\n\nHis children didn't question his final words. Perhaps assuming it was madness like others had done since the beginning. Perhaps it was madness, but that didn't matter. Russia was nearly whole again, united and strong. He had done all he could for the people, his heir would do so much more, of that he was certain. While he had regrets, Rurik II, King of the Rus, was satisfied with what he had built.\n\nAnd so Nikolai Ivanovich Krylov closed his eyes for the last time, his duty finally ending."

His generals, his family and the Zemsky Sobor had all argued against this, saying a ceremony within the palace would be safer and far more grand. But Yurily had insisted it take place outside. It was the people who made this kingdom possible after all; they deserved to see such a momentous occasion first hand.\n\nHe turned away from the railing, glancing briefly at his sister, who stared at him from the sidelines. Looking indignant and annoyed but not as angry as he once would have expected from her. He then looked at his father's crown, held by a union leader, selected by raffle for this occasion. He placed his hand on the crown, turning to speak into the microphone.\n\n"This crown is far more than a birthright, it is a vow, a promise to all the people of this great kingdom." He addressed the cheering crowd. "To uphold all my father has built for you. To ensure that your rights, your liberties, and your prosperity are all protected. That no enemy, foreign or domestic, will ever again threaten to take all you have earned in the past decade."\n\nYurily knelt, allowing the union leader to place the crown upon his head.

In the past, the Romanovs were crowned by a member of the church, as a sign their power ultimately came from god. The Rus had no time for such superstitious nonsense. The crown was held by one of the Queensguard, and no one would crown Lydia but herself. She grabbed the crown, one she had specifically made for her. Holding in her hands she felt a pain of regret. Her father was dead, her brother in exile. Whatever the kingdom would face in years to come, she would have to do it without them.\n\nShe killed such thoughts. For the sake of the kingdom she would have to move past these doubts, move past even being Lydia. Bury the Princess like she buried the nurse so long ago. She placed the crown atop her head.\n\n"All Hail Queen Rogneda, Queen of the Rus." The Queensguard declared to all gathered.\n\nRogneda rose from her throne as the people clapped. She allowed them a moment before she spoke.\n\n"We have come fair in recent years. From one tiny spot in the siberian wilderness we have managed to forge a vast and mighty empire, defeating all who dared challenge us." She declared to the hall. "But our duty is not over.

His rule had not been peaceful, and it had not been perfect, but he had achieved a great deal.\n\nThe sun was halfway below the horizon, the orange sky turning to red, and the red fading to purple. The first stars began to shine down from the heavens, outnumbered by the lights from the city below.The King grew weaker with every passing day, and he now needed a cane to move about his palace. Rurik knew he would not live to see Moscow freed from the Germans who enslaved his people. He would have to leave that duty to his successor, his heir. He knew that they could succeed, he believed he had prepared them well. His child would lead this Kingdom to greatness, and avenge the humiliation the Motherland had been put through. Nikolai Krylov chuckled, knowing that his children and the rest of the nation were so attached to the Rurikid ideals, the mask he had eventually become.\n\nThe sun was now below the horizon, and night had fallen over the Motherland once more.

Rurik was quite sure it would become a staple piece of [KEM.Capital.GetName] for years to come.\n\nOf course, the sculptor clearly took some artistic liberties. Rurik quite often would not go into battle carrying a sword while riding a horse, no matter how much he wanted to. He also was not as muscular as he was in the sculpture, but still, Rurik was quite pleased. He quite liked how it was overly romanticized, and he had to make sure the sculptor was paid well for his work.\n\nAnd if this was enough to be put up just for the unification of Central Siberia, he couldn't dream of what would be put up in his honor once Moscow was back in Russia's grasp."

The item on the agenda concerned the recruitment restrictions and desired qualifications for state bureaucrats, primarily as it concerned their social status. True to his roots, Prince Yuriy favoured relaxing or even eliminating them altogether, both in order to promote social advancements as well as to connect the ordinary people to their government in stronger fashion.\n\nAt that, Lydia responded with her usual cutting, derisive laughter. The people, she proclaimed, were unreliable at best, and insurrectionist at worse. Bureaucrats should be hand-picked from the aristocracy, she argued, in order to ensure both that they owed their loyalty to the institutions of government, and were unlikely to have sympathies with revolutionary elements.\n\nThe 'debate' continued as most expected. Yuriy called his sister a tyrant, and she called him a fool, with the epithets only escalating from there and those in attendance silently counting the minutes where they would once again be free, unwilling to place themselves in the line of fire.\n\nThough all, including the royal siblings, knew that a decision would eventually be made by their father."

Finally arriving home, his wife was the first thing he saw as he walked through the door. "Helana, what are you wearing!" Said Oleg, incredulously.\n\n"It's my new fur coat, all the women are wearing it. Noblewomen used to wear these back in ancient Russia! The colors on it are just gorgeous! I think I'll keep it forever!" Helana said, smiling.\n\nOleg stammered, not knowing what to say. His wife, wearing insane clothing as well? Everyone was wearing something from the medieval age!\n\n"Honey, what's wrong?" Said Helana. "You know what, you really need a new coat. Did you see that place near the bakery? It has a very good selection of men's clothing. Let's take you there tomorrow. We can get some for the kids as well! It will be perfect!""

 kemreg.37.desc:0 "Father Kiril watched silently, his heart heavy, as the soldiers moved to pack his icons, bibles, and other priestly items in the boxes present. His church had been 'requisitioned' by the Royal Army for use as a command post, and it had been made very clear, as politely as possible, that he had no choice in the matter.\n\nThe common soldiers themselves had been very respectful, and were taking great care not to damage any of Kiril's religious items as they collected them, but such did little to soften the blow. He had led this church, and the small community around it, for decades, doing his best to provide guidance and support to the simple - yet pious - people of the local villages. And now he was not sure if he would ever be permitted to return.\n\nHe had heard from his fellow priests about this happening elsewhere, churches taken over by the military, who greatly valued the belltowers for observation and the cellars for protection. More than one had been destroyed by the enemy if and when the fighting had turned. More still, though left standing, were returned to their once-shepherds in terrible condition. He dearly hoped that would not be the case for him.\n\nAs the soldiers finished packing and carefully stacked the boxes beside the doorway, Kiril took one last look around the now-empty nave, and realized how much larger it seemed when bereft of fixtures. Then he picked up the boxes, carried them to the cart that one of the local farmers had insisted he use for travel, and departed.\n\nAnd as the belltower of his church disappeared over the horizon, he could not stifle his tears."

 kemreg.38.desc:0 "It was always a good day, the delegates thought, when King Rurik was in attendance at the meeting of the Zemsky Sobor. Primarily because it meant a decision would most likely be made, and there would not simply be an eternal argument between his children.\n\nToday, they quickly found themselves to be at least half-correct. Rurik, after opening the session and thanking all those there, announced the immediate imposition of a number of welfare-based reforms upon the state, as recommended by Prince Yuriy.\n\nThough Yuriy was quick to stand and thank the King for the 'foresight' he so clearly possessed, little attention was paid to him. For all eyes were upon Princess Lydia who, as her father's announcement had progressed, had become increasingly still, a motion they had learned was always followed by eruption.\n\nAn eruption that soon followed as her voice echoed through the chamber. The very concept was inexcusable, she cried, and by even recommending it to their father in the first place Yuriy had failed in his duties. The challenges facing the state were immense, she continued passionately, and their resources were highly limited. Diverting those to social endeavours instead of the military or other security forces was not only shortsighted, it was, according to her, borderline criminal.\n\nAfter a short while, and during a pause, Yuriy calmly asked his sister if she was finished. As she stared back at him, wide-eyed, he turned to King Rurik, who only nodded as he looked at his daughter.\n\nAnd that was that. Lydia sunk back down into her chair, defeated for now. But the look of fury in her eyes was unmistakable, and all knew that this decision was not, could not, be the end."

 kemreg.39.desc:0 ""Give it to me straight, Boris: what's the situation out there? Is it as bad as I've heard?" Rurik's voice was dripping with deep concern. Rumors had reached him that there had been brawls on the street between supporters of his son, and those of his daughter. He had hoped, perhaps in vain, that this was merely an exaggeration by the press.\n\nBoris Krylov sat across from his father, taking pause before delivering the news. "Truthfully? Yes, it is. There's been reports of violent scuffles in Novosibirsk between strikers and local police, a bar brawl between coal miners and wealthy patrons in Krasnoyarsk nearly turned into a riot, and to say nothing of the protests and counter-protests in Kemerovo..."\n\nRurik looked distant as his mind processed this troubling news. It was no longer metaphorical: his children were going to war. While these groups weren't directly associated with them, it was all too clear who they had wanted to take charge in his absence.\n\n"... Father?"\n\n"Boris, we need to take back the streets. If we don't do something soon, we'll be heading back to the bad old days..."\n\n"Just say the word, father, and I'll order the troops to move in."\n\nRurik looked to his son with wide eyes. Had it already come to this? "No! No martial law. The police can handle this, we'll just need to double their presence on the ground...""

Placard hit banner as they both came together, not in unity or solidarity, but out of hatred and resentment. As the shouts of the crowds increased in amount and fury, the police standing guard looked at each other nervously. Much as they'd prefer not to intervene, they were being left with little choice. With one of them sent to get backup, the rest of the officers stood watch with grim determination, ready to step in and put a stop to things if necessary.\n\nFortunately for them, backup arrived just in time, having their numbers doubled and being ready to go on short notice by Rurik's own orders. As they reinforced the officers already on the scene, the confrontation before them began to turn violent, with punches being landed and signs being thrown. At the sound of the whistle, the police descended as a group on the two crowds, and after dealing with minor resistance, they dispersed both. Even with the current clash taken care of, each officer thought the same thing."

He could tell that she had not believed the lie he had told to draw her here for an instant, but had come nonetheless out of respect for their father. Yuriy arrived later. Rurik quickly took control before they could begin sparring.\n\nHe had asked Boris to set this up, he said, because he was tired, both personally and officially, of seeing his two more prominent children at constant, and violent odds. It was bad for his health, he continued, and it was very bad for the stability of the state. Together with Boris he, they, implored them to come to an understanding.\n\nThe room was quiet for a long, long moment, before Lydia laughed, sharply and cruelly, and in that moment Boris knew they had failed. She did not have to do anything of the sort, she said coldly, as she had done nothing wrong. She had always acted in the best interests of the state, and Yuriy needed to accept that.\n\nYuriy immediately retorted that he had always acted in the interests of the people, and if she could not see that a state without its people was nothing, she did not deserve her position. The war of words continued as Boris looked desperately at their father, who only shook his head. Another failure.\n\nShortly thereafter Lydia declared the entire affair a waste of time, and stood. Yuriy did the same, one of the few things, he said, that he could agree with her upon. They both stormed out a moment later.\n\nBoris and Rurik exchanged a sigh. What else could they do?"

Considering some of the stories they had heard of even more unfortunate villages, it very well might be even with them there. They had little food, less warmth, and no guns of any note. All that awaited them was a slow death.\n\nSuddenly they began to hear the sound of boots on the ground, and looked out their windows with a mixture of fear and dread. Had the bandits returned? They had nothing of value left to give them! However, as the sound grew closer, they began to be able to make out shapes, and then the people they made up. These were no bandits; these were workers from the royal government, the one that'd won the wars. Their fear was replaced by a new, and similar one. Had taxes been increased?\n\nHowever, the new arrivals greeted them amiably as they passed, and one man even ruffled the hair of a boy with his head sticking out of the window. As the villagers watched in amazement, these workers set about repairing the damage the conflicts had done to the village, repairing holes in walls and shattered windows. These men were not here to take from them; they were here to give to them the help they had so badly needed for so long. Some of the villagers cheered as they worked; others wept with joy. All thought the same: luck had finally returned to their lives.\n\nSome semblance of hope had returned to their hearts."

Intellectuals, poets, and professors, the most intelligent people of Russia crowded into one room. Rurik was certain they would be of good use to Central Siberia. "Gentlemen!" Said Rurik, in a booming voice. "I'm glad all of you excepted my invitation. As a great and kind leader, I am wise enough to understand there can be much that can be learned from your enemies."\n\n"Wise!" Shouted a man in a sleek suit, looking very different compared to Rurik's ministers in large robes. "Your insane, not wise! You declared yourself Tsar after you had too much to drink!"\n\nRurik smirked. "At least I am wise enough to defeat your armies in battle." The group grew quiet, almost hostile. "As I was saying... I invited you here today for your ideas. Central Siberia is hard to govern, and our economic situation is less than positive. Your salons were among those who governed Central Siberia when Russia first fell apart. We are all Russians, and this is our home."\n\nThe room remained quiet until a man with glasses broke the silence. "Rurik, we may have our disagreements, but I can tell you are a caring man. If you truly want to make the lives of the people better, I implore you to consider greater welfare for the people. War has ravaged Russia, and they need hope of a better future."\n\n"Who needs welfare!" Shouted a small man in a tie that reached down to his waist. "We don't have the money for that! What the people need is education, only then will they be able to improve their lives themselves and serve their country. No man can just throw money into the air and expect their problems to be fixed!"\n\nAnother man, slender and wearing a formal looking hat stood up. "The people will not have satisfaction without democracy! As long as you continue to be a tyrant, Tsar, this place will see only despair!"\n\nAs the shouting match continued and more men began to speak over each other, Rurik was reminded of his children's own petty bickering.

Rejoice, for now nothing will hinder the free movement of trade and of you, the people!" The crowd murmured among themselves, though for the most part they seemed unsure what to make of the finished development. No matter. Worst comes to worst they'd have to come around. After all, whether they liked it or not, the highway would play a large part of their lives from now on.\n\nOver the next few days, traffic on the highway increased at first slowly, then exponentially, with reports of booming trade arriving at Voznesensky's office. It was just as he had thought; with any obstacles removed from their path, people couldn't resist the allure of traveling elsewhere to sell their wares for more. It was astounding that the old government in Tomsk had never thought of this, but then, he had never placed much stock into them anyways.\n\nYes, he thought, lighting a cigarette between his teeth, this was going to make a lot of people a lot of money.\n\nMost importantly, of course, himself."

 kemreg.45.desc:0 "Gavril stood among a throng of his fellow workers, the scent of sweat and the sound of conversation hanging heavy over the group of 50 or 60 men. Hard hat on his head and hammer slung over his shoulder, Gavril squinted against the morning glare as he gazed upon the factory complex he had once worked in. It certainly had been refurbished, and this gave him and many others preparing to enter the building hope that the mad old king had actually kept his promise.\n\nSome foreman out of Gavril's view blew a whistle and the mass of working men suddenly shifted forward. Gavril found himself swept along with the tide and into his new workplace, his heart full of cautious optimism as he and the other workers crossed the broad threshold. That optimism was quickly crushed as, while the exterior had been decorated with fancy trappings calling back to eras long gone with a modern, safe undercurrent, the interior of the foundry wasn't that different from what it was before. The furnace that had unexpectedly belched out flame like some ash-caked dragon and sent 4 men to the infirmary. The rickety stairway up to the second level that had been broken and repaired dozens of times, and with it many of his coworker's legs, ribs or skulls. The busted casting ladle that periodically leaked molten metal, burning the flesh of the operator.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, however. The doors, for one, could be opened from the inside in case of emergency. The wiring that kept the lights on was safely sealed inside the walls. There was a list of safety protocols, first aid tips or other useful information on every wall. But what relieved Gavril the most was the presence of enough gloves, masks, aprons and other safety tools to protect every man in the building. The machines may still be dangerous, but the madman has at least made a token effort towards safety. Still, Gavril did not feel much safer than he did before the city changed hands."

Grumbling, he sat up and fumbled for the phone, lifting it to his ear and sighing.\n\n"Hello?"\n\n"Hello, your highness. This is Boris Kelchev, I spoke with you the other day."\n\nRurik thoughts wandered to a question: How did this man get his personal number? That question was quickly answered for him, however, as the union boss carried on in his gravelly baritone,\n\n"Your son, Yuriy, gave me the number at the meeting, if you're wondering."\n\nOh, that's right, thought Rurik. He loved that boy, and understood the cause and the pain of the kingdom's working class, but damn if he didn't jump the gun every time there was an opportunity to help. "Too nice for his own good." Muttered Rurik inaudibly.\n\n"Oh yes, yes. It was wonderful meeting you - what are you calling to discuss?"\n\n"Well, really, I'm calling to thank you. I wasn't so sure about how sincere you were when you said you'd be strengthening the unions, but your reforms have really paid off! The boss is treating us far, far better, and accidents are down 20% because they're keeping the equipment clean and repaired. The union thanks you, King Rurik."\n\nThat put a smile on the old King's face; perhaps Yuriy had been right after all. The workers are the lifeblood of the kingdom, and they're better off than ever. Following a short exchange of goodbyes, Rurik put down the phone and laid his head back on the pillow, one thought on his mind."

This strike was the latest of a series, and easily the largest. The union had paralyzed the city of Krasnoyarsk in their demand for better pay and working conditions. Business leaders weren't happy with this situation, that much was clear, but they had been ordered not to disrupt strikes, and orders were to be followed. Their hands were tied, and there was nothing to be done about it.\n\nAfter hours of agonizing shutdown for the city, business leaders finally came to the strikers to negotiate, being greeted by boos and jeers and leaving with their heads down to the sound of cheers. Clearly, they had earned themselves few friends, and much animosity, among those who worked for them. Even so, looking at all the people who hadn't been able to simply carry on with their lives, one had to wonder... was there really no other way to a better world?"

Long considered, by the Princess and her faction as politically suspect and unreliable, the dissolution of the councils was a clear victory for Lydia in the ever-continuing conflict with her brother.\n\nWith the Guilds so empowered, production and efficiency could be emphasized instead of worker discord and agitation, and at this Voznesensky could not help but feel content. The state was still surrounded by enemies and that, combined with the revolutionary sentiment that seemed endemic within Central Siberia, was something that had to be addressed, and not permitted to fester in established organizations.\n\nYes, he thought as he looked out over the long lines of workers standing and waiting to re-register, this was the better choice. Yuriy's counterproposal might have had value, but it also had more risk, and such risk could not be entertained.\n\nHe only wished that the Princess did not take such savage, and obvious, enjoyment in her 'victory.'"

Rising to his feet in his modest worker's apartment in Krasnoyarsk, the union boss had made the trek down 5 flights of stairs in a panic. His breathing heavy and labored by the time he got to the bottom of the steps, he stumbled out the front door of the building and stared across the street at the local steelworks in horror.\n\nThe setting sun tinted the sky around the square orange, and ochre shaded tear gas rose like a smokestack as striking workers scrambled in the street. The men cried out in pain, staggered in their blindness, held their soot stained shirts over their faces and coughed dry, bitter coughs. In front of the mass of terrified workers was a group of about 20 or so men- thugs, really, clad in makeshift riot gear and faceless gas masks. They formed a line around the area where the orderly protest had once been, but Boris noticed something shocking in particular. While some of those there were clearly strikebreakers hired by the guild that owned the factory, judging by the symbols plastered onto their gear, Boris also counted at least a dozen local police officers in the midst of the crowd.\n\n"How the hell can they let this happen?" Spat Boris, turning around to go into his apartment. As he climbed the stairs, still shocked from the site, he continued to mutter to himself.\n\n"That lying fat bastard, the madman pretends he's for the people and then lets this happen," Boris fumbled with his keys, got into his apartment, and walked over to the window and stared out into the city in a simmering rage.

Because each and every one of the soldiers was a woman, a member of the first expansion division of the Shieldmaidens. And there would be many more to come.\n\nIt had been hard, very hard, to convince some of the old generals and men of power in the state that the Shieldmaidens even had a legitimate purpose - let alone that they should be expanded - but she had prevailed. As usual. The proof was in front of her, and it heralded a great future, for with women being openly welcomed into the armed forces, the state's available manpower had nearly doubled.\n\nSuch expanded reserves had uses far beyond simply fighting on the front lines as well, as proven by the presence of General Anna Kotsur on the dais beside Lydia and the King. There would soon be more like her, the opportunities now available making sure that the potential of half of the state's citizens would not be wasted.\n\nYes, Lydia thought, this had been an important victory. More soldiers and more troops meant that the state could continue to expand and consolidate its territory, and subsequent security threats could be more easily addressed without compromising strength at the front.\n\nOf course, it also helped that all of the new Shieldmaidens well knew who had fought to afford them this opportunity, and how easily others might conspire to take it away.

"This looks... adequate."\n\n"Erm, 'adequate'? What do you mean?" The designer maintained a courteous smile, but there was evidence of exasperated panic in his voice.\n\n"Well, it's not very different from the old model, is it? All you did was fix up the engine, when you should be thinking bigger! I want you to see if you can fit a bigger gun and more armor on this thing."\n\n"Well, uh, all due respect, Your Majesty, but that wouldn't be practical for us at the moment. Tanks in this day and age tend to rely on speed rather than blunt force, and-"\n\nSuddenly, the King put a firm hand on the designer's shoulder, and he felt as though his heart stopped for a small instant. "Oh, nonsense. You're going to put more armor and more firepower on it, and you're going to make it work. Stop worrying about minute details and work with the same ethic that built this kingdom.

Apparently, Rurik had taken an interest in his work with the Kamov Helicopter Design Bureau and wanted to meet him the very next day around noon. After an exchange of niceties, Kamov put Rurik on hold while he scrambled in the wee hours of the morning to schedule a last-minute meeting with the king. By 2, he had failed to book any kind of meeting space at the Bureau office, and instead would be meeting Rurik in the workshop. This was why, at noon, Nikolay Kamov was putting papers in order and a model on the table in a dusty workshop to meet a goddamn king on 10 hours of notice.\n\nRight as he made his last preparations, the door swung open and the old King hobbled his way in. Nikolay snapped to attention but was quickly dismissed by Rurik, "At ease, friend. I'd like to keep this informal, all I need is for you to tell me about your wondrous flying machines."\n\nNikolay raised an eyebrow at the term, but shrugged it off. The King had seen better days, surely. Offering the king a seat, Nikolay began taking his highness through the workings of the Bureau's latest design. Rurik was friendly and cordial, but quite frankly confused, as the craft, as well as its expenses, was explained. Almost every sentence, the king asked something absurdly ignorant, but Nikolay humored his questions with slight annoyance. Then, once done, awaited the king's response, who had been stroking his chin for the last few minutes of the pitch.\n\n"Fine work, young man." Rurik said, to the nearly 70 year old aeronautics engineer. Rurik smirked to himself, watching Nikolay's bewilderment, "Anyways, I think your Bureau would benefit from some funding from the crown. I'd like to put a few million rubles into this project, what do you say?"\n\nNikolay lit up, drumming his fingers across the table with excitement at the prospect. "We would welcome it, sir!

The prince's eyes widened as he realized who it was.\n\nThe prince gave a sigh of relief, and felt a cautious smile overtake his face as Rurik II turned to wave at him and the rest of the spectators on the balcony. "He really has gone mad, hasn't he?" Yuriy said under his breath. Deep down, he wouldn't have it any other way."

This took many hours, and at the end of it all Rurik was sure he had heard the same argument numerous times.\n\nWhen he asked them why this was, they reacted with horror. Each of their positions could not be more different than that of the other, they all claimed, saying they merely needed several more hours to make the distinctions clear. That was the wrong answer.\n\nAngered by what he now knew to be a colossal waste of time, he dismissed them back to their city and, within several minutes, signed a decree implementing his heir's suggestion. The decision was made without dissent, and without days, or potentially weeks, of delay.\n\nDemocracy, Rurik thought. He had made the right choice indeed in his style of rule."

Moreso than the other squabblers and plotters throughout the vast Russian lands, Rurik II, known many moons ago as a Marshal of a greater Soviet Union bearing the name Nikolai Ivanovich Krylov, has born the name of conqueror past these frozen lands, allowing man, woman, and child to feast upon their glories and victories they've rightly earned. Just as Rurik intends to do so tonight.\n\n"My Lord, the guests have arrived!" said the Captain of the Guard as two Russian men bearing snow-laden coats walked in. One bore a steely set of glasses and a sharp mustache and goatee, whilst the other cared less for appearances, bearing grizzly scars across an equally grizzly, unshaven face.\n\n"The two Alexanders, greater than any great conqueror of Greece, and greater friends than any Tsar may ask of!" Cried the Tsar, as he hopped down his steps and embraced the two tightly in his warm coat.\n\nAnd thus, Tsar Rurik the Second was joined by Alexander Sevtsov and Alexander Kazartsev for a night of hardy laughter, belly-warming drinks, and glorious stories. It was true: each of these men had to think constantly each and every day, making plans centered around the very survival of their people, whilst the haunting poltergeists of a war lost long ago crept upon their shoulders, rousing them to an awakening each and every night as the screams of fallen comrades plagued them.

The vast majority, however, did not notice any incongruity with the current reality they had been living in.\n\nThe armor had been the talk of Novosibirsk ever since Tsar Rurik II had been seen, protected by his royal guard, at the local blacksmith. All citizens of the Tsardom had speculated of specially made armor, for the leader to ride off into battle on horseback, but no one had expected it to be so authentically traditional.\n\nAs he strode through the street, his men and tanks at his back, there came a moment where he stopped. He signaled to his men, and they, in confusion, did as they were told. The Tsar, mumbling something under his breathe, called for his horse, and, as the whole crowd of loyal subjects watched in worry, rode away without further explanation.\n\nThe day afterwards, the Tsar gave a decree that he had a mystical experience and wished to be left alone, as he needed time to 'understand and contemplate the reason for my feelings that day.'\n\nThe armor was never seen again."

The mayor knelt before him and pledged his eternal loyalty to the Tsar.\n\nThe king in a booming voice declared the mayor Lord of Magadan, and declared Valentin Tsvetkov the head of a new noble house. Following his ascension to nobility, Tsvetkov was granted his official coat of arms, and a ceremonial sword. In celebration of the event, several of Rurik's retainers participated in a somewhat impromptu jousting tournament located upon Magadan's largest street. Several more hours of entertainment followed, until it was time for the small private dinner the King had Tsvetkov prepare.\n\nThe dinner was fairly quiet, with the two men discussing the more mundane aspects of Valentin's duties. They discussed things like army recruitment quotas, tax policies, Magadan's port, overseas trade, and the hypothetical revival of Russia's Pacific Fleet. Throughout the dinner, however, the King seemed distracted, as if something was deeply bothering him. As they were finishing their meal, the Tsar let out a deep, depressed sigh. Tsvetkov was too nervous to directly ask what was bothering the monarch, and instead silently wondered if his hospitality had been unsatisfactory. As he was about to speak up, the deafening silence of the room was broken by the arrival of several servants, accompanied by guests.

This wasn't just a professional rivalry anymore, it was pure disdain- simmering hatred for the man who had deprived her of her destiny.\n\nYuriy achieved his victory, but did not feel the relief he was expecting. He still had work to do. The people of Russia now looked to him for guidance, eagerly expecting Yuriy to make good on his bold promises of reform, and the prince had no intention of letting them down.

What right, he thought, did this upstart have to rip up a prestigious institution like the Kingsguard? The sound of his door opening disrupted his ruminations.\n\n"Sir, they're here! They've come to disarm us by force!" The commander's aide had a frantic look in his eyes.\n\n"Who's here? Is it the army?"\n\n"I'm not sure. I didn't recognize their uniforms. I suspect it might be our replacements." Yakov had suspected that the upstart prince already had a paramilitary force of his own ready to take the place of the Guard, and this news merely confirmed his suspicions. Not only was the Kingsguard being disbanded, but their successors were to have their baptism by fire. Yakov turned away from his aide to peer out the window. Armed troops wearing uniforms not unlike those of the Kingsguard were fanning out through the barracks. It wouldn't be long before they'd find their way to Yakov's office.\n\nSuch a brazen display of authority insulted the proud commander. Not only were the noble Kingsguard to be disbanded, but the prince clearly did not trust the Guard enough to allow them to do so on their own terms. Yakov dismissed the distraught aide, and took a seat at his desk as the sounds of running boots became audible from downstairs.

An air almost warm in nature began to take hold in the Zemsky Sobor, far different from the intimidating environment it presented in the past.\n\n"It is my belief that the formation of proper political associations would go great lengths towards ensuring healthy political discourse within the realm. With my father's blessing, I have already begun to work with several of my fellow council members to build the foundations of a truly democratic, parliamentarian kingdom.

I know you must despise me for what I did, and there's nothing I can say to change that. At the end of the day, though, we are siblings. I still believe we can work past this political mess, because blood bonds are stronger than any ideological differences. We can come together again, but first I just need you to work with me.

Lydia would not let familial quarrels stand in the way of her destiny.\n\nAs the princess finished her glass, a wolf howled in the distance. Tomorrow, her work begins."

It was a dreadfully dull afternoon, but the princess still tried her level best to approach this task with the very same meticulousness she had become known for. Lydia's attention was drawn to the sound of loud footsteps drawing closer. She lifted her head to see her brother, Yuriy, emerge from the half-open doorway. He did not look pleased.\n\n"What is the meaning of this, Lydia? You're making me the governor of Chukotka?"\n\nLydia gave a half-hearted sigh. "Are you not happy with your promotion, brother? I'll have you know that province was in need of-"\n\n"Do you think I'm fucking stupid?! This might as well be exile! You only want me out of the capital so you never have to hear my complaints ever again!" Yuriy's voice was raised to the brink of screaming.\n\n"Oh, Yuriy. It's never good enough for you, is it? You should be lucky you're being given a job at all. Everything I do, I do it for the good of the realm. If only you could understand that."\n\n"You walk down a dark road, Lydia. First you bring the Zemsky Sobor to heel, now you exile your own brother. This is not the way our kingdom should be governed, it goes against everything our father wanted!" Lydia looked distant as her brother spoke. "Please, sister. Exile me if you must, but do not allow yourself to become a tyrant. Russia has suffered through too many already."\n\nAs Yuriy turned to leave his sister's office, Lydia remained silent. Her brother's words had fallen on deaf ears."

 KEM_lydia.3.desc:0 "One by one, the new recruits of what would be the Queensguard traversed the obstacle course before them, moving at a breakneck pace that would break those of a weak constitution. These hardy women were handpicked from various units of the Royal Army, some with years of service to the King under their belt. The Queensguard, however, was a cut above the regular army unit. Only the most elite of the elite were going to make it.\n\nToday, the recruits found themselves under more pressure than usual. Anna Kotsur, the newly promoted captain of the unit, was supervising the training; there would be no room for mediocrity under her watch.\n\n"Faster, you wretches, FASTER! Move you like your lives depend on it!" Kotsur had been yelling encouragement of a similar nature all afternoon. The voice of their captain felt like a cattle prod to the recruits, forcing them to push their bodies as far as they could go. Her gaze wandering towards the back of the squad, Kotsur couldn't help but notice one of the recruits was struggling to climb a rope.\n\n"Hey! You call that climbing?! Get your ass in gear!" The attention of her captain visibly caused the straining recruit even more stress. She was drenched in sweat, and her limbs shook under the strain. As the recruit attempted in vain to reach higher, she finally achieved her breaking point. Kotsur watched as the woman's face went white; letting go of the rope as she seemingly passed out. The unconscious recruit landed hard in the mud below as medics rushed from the sidelines to her aid. The captain shook her head. This one clearly did not have the makings of a Queensguard."

He turned to see if his wife was out late again, only to discover she was right next to him; still lost a deep sleep. The banging continued, loud enough to startle him despite being a few rooms away.\n\n"Damn it..." Semyon mumbled as he got out of bed. In this state, the journey to his front door was daunting indeed. The banging persisted, each sequence more loud than the last. Whoever it was, they were clearly impatient. "Just wait, I'm on my way! Good lord..." By the time he had reached the door, Semyon had mostly managed to regain his bearings. He took a peek through the peephole to see just who this late visitor was. What he saw made his blood run cold.\n\nThere were four large men, wearing uniforms resembling those of the police. Before he could react, the man in front kicked the door with all his might, causing it to fling open. Semyon yelled as he was knocked onto his back; the sound of heavy boots filled the room as the men moved inside.\n\n"Semyon Stoyanovich! By the order of His Majesty, you are under arrest for conspiring against the crown!" Semyon gave a confused look to the officer, words failing to form. The officers did not wait for his reply. One by one they grabbed Semyon by his arms, and began dragging him out of the room. Semyon saw his wife emerge just as the situation escalated.\n\n"Oh my god!" She cried, falling to her knees in despair. As Semyon was pulled into the hallway and out of her sight, he wondered if he'd ever see her again."

Thousands of the elite soldiers had arranged before their king in a strict and orderly fashion, eagerly awaiting his words. The rows of marines stretched nearly as far as the King could see. He cleared his throat, and began.\n\n"More than a millennium ago, ferocious sea-faring warriors roamed the countless rivers of the Rus'. The northmen would eventually assemble the foundations of what would become Russia, founding the great cities of Kiev, Novgorod, and countless others. The deeds of these great warriors continue to echo through the ages even to this day, and there is no greater proof of this than the stalwart men and women who stand before me today!"\n\n"You have all trained hard for this day, and now it has finally come. You, my brave Varyags, shall become the sword and shield of the Rus' on the waves. No waters will be too treacherous, no enemy too imposing, no victory too out of reach! Go now, my warriors, and make me proud. Your king shall observe your glorious exploits with great interest!"\n\nAs the King finished his speech, every single Varyag brought their heels together and gave a salute to their monarch. The soldiers then made a single, overpowering cry:\n\n"Long live the king!""

The horizon was entirely dominated with lights and tall buildings larger than anything he had seen in Russia. The King had heard Japan was an endless jungle of concrete and neon, but now he truly knew what they had meant. "So, this is what civilization looks like! Imagine if we had such structures back in [KEM.Capital.GetName]?"\n\nEntering the airport terminal, Rurik was immediately met with a large delegation of Japanese diplomats. Judging by the looks on their faces, they appeared quite excited to meet him. The man at the front of the group gave a bow. "Greetings, Rurik-sama! Allow me to extend a most warm welcome to Japan." The gleeful diplomat warmly offered a handshake to the king.\n\n"Thank you. By the way, it's Rurik." Rurik smiled nervously as he shook the diplomat's hand, who was visibly confused by the king's response.\n\n"Erm, yes, of course, Rurik-sama."\n\n"No, no. It's just Rurik. Ru-rik. Understand?"\n\n"I don't understand, Rurik-sama. Did I speak out of turn?"\n\nThe king became visibly flustered. "I told you, it's-" Before he could finish, Rurik was pulled to the side by one of his entourage, who leaned in to whisper into his ear.\n\n"Terribly sorry, Your Majesty, but he is merely using an honorific. Do not worry, he knows your name." Upon hearing this news, the king's face went red. The strange ways of the Japanese would take some effort to learn."

The taps of his cane echoed as he walked to his office at a speed that even a snail would find wanting. His daughter Lydia accompanied him, trying her level best to match the King's sluggish pace. "Are you sure you don't need help, father?" There was genuine concern in the princess' voice.\n\n"I'm fine, Lydia." Rurik sighed. "It's days like these that remind me I'm not long for this world..."\n\n"Do not say that, father. You know I don't like it when you talk of your own mortality."\n\n"I'm sorry, Lydia. It's just... there is so much left to do. To die would be to abandon my duties."\n\n"I think you've accomplished quite enough already. What we have achieved so far is nothing short of extraordinary, and it couldn't have been done without you. Asking any more would be unreasonable."\n\nRurik stopped and turned to his daughter, grasping her hands. "Lydia, tell me, will my realm be in good hands?"\n\nLydia met her father's gaze, not a hint of doubt in her eyes. "There is not a single person in this kingdom who cares for it like you and I do.""

She listened only with the most mild interest, instead focusing on the newest reports on industrialization throughout the report. Only when the messenger stated the report when two guards were reported... intermingling, in a phrase.\n\n"Fraternization is normal, I suppose, a simple removal will do," she said.\n\n"Yes, your Highness, but these were relations of a... unsavory sort, unnatural and of the homosexual."\n\nAh, she thought. That explains it.\n\n"What are their names?"\n\n"Maxim and Yury, Your excellency."\n\n"I see. You are dismissed." The messenger walked away, making sure to close the door to her chamber as quietly as possible.\n\nRogneda leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes. That relationship was disgusting, but not exactly unknown among those in the army. Her father often called the bonds of battle stronger than love itself. Still, while expected, she couldn't let it slide. They were dangers, both to her image to the people and to the security of the palace if they were to be found out.\n\nCalling up the Captain of the guard, and receiving multiple reports from the Oprichniki, she came to the conclusion that, aside from their relationship, they were loyal and, more importantly, had been competent soldiers to her father in the 50s. Would it truly be wise to dismiss such people due to their disorders, which seemingly had not harmed their ability to work.\n\nTaking out a piece of paper, she wrote an order to the Captain for both of them to be stationed on opposite sides of the palace, and that they were to be placed on guard duty at two separate shifts."
