 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_DMITRY_KARBYSHEV_DESC:0 "드미트리 미하일로비치 카르비셰프의 이야기는 배신과 상실, 그리고 분노로 가득 찬 비극적인 이야기입니다. 처음에 그는 대전쟁 동안 차르를 위해 싸웠고, 내전기에는 적위군에 가담했으며, 조국이 다시 한번 침략당하자 군으로 돌아왔습니다. 독일군에게 포로로 잡혀 여러 포로 수용소를 전전한 카르비셰프는 얻어맞고 고문당했으며 죽기 직전까지 내버려졌지만, 절대로 인민에 대한 희망을 잃어버린 적이 없습니다. 마침내 그와 소수의 동료들은 죽음의 수용소를 탈출해 동부로 도망치는데 성공했고 나약한 연방이 장악한 지역을 지나쳐 라자리 카가노비치의 서시베리아 인민공화국에 가담했습니다.\n\n수년간 자신이 당했던 고통을 잊어버리지 않은 카르비셰프는 러시아가 다시는 그런 고통을 당하게 두지 않겠다고 굳게 다짐했습니다. 그는 자신이 §R대시련§! 이라고 이름붙인 러시아의 운명을 둔 독일과의 최후 결전을 준비하기 시작했습니다. 비슷한 사상을 가지고 대의에 동조한 수많은 동지들을 모은 그는 얼마 지나지 않아 카가노비치에게 대항해 반란을 일으켜 옴스크를 점거했고, 편안히 준비할 수 있도록 도시를 요새화했습니다. 카르비셰프는 자신이 러시아 앞에 벌어질 문제를 지도할 수 있는 유일한 단체라고 판단한 전 러시아 흑색 연합의 지배권을 주장했습니다.\n\n하지만 시간이 흘렀고 한때 충성스러웠던 장교들 사이에서 불신이 싹텄습니다. 이제 그는 아무 것도 할 수 없는 와중에 주변을 빙빙 도는 독수리들을 지켜보면서 자신이 구원하기를 바랬던 사람들이 적이 아닌 자기들끼리 싸우는 모습을 눈물 흘리며 바라볼 수 밖에 없게 되었습니다. 드미트리 카르비셰프는 §R대시련§!이 점차 가까워지는 와중에 자신의 유지를 이을 누군가가 나타나지 않는다면 러시아에 필연적으로 닥칠 파멸을 두려워하고 있습니다."
 
 POLITICS_DMITRY_YAZOV_DESC:0 "드미트리 티모페예비치 야조프는 소비에트 이후의 새로운 세대입니다: 레닌의 부상 이후로 태어났고, 차르와 대전쟁에 대한 기억은 없습니다. 아이일때 고난을 알았지만, 그러나 그것이 모국의 생존을 위한 불가결한 희생이란 것을 알았습니다. 나치들이 서쪽에서 몰려올때, 그들은 붉은 군대의 최전선에서 싸웠으며, 지상에 강림한 지옥을 보았으며 패배의 쓴잔을 들이켰고 또 들이켰습니다. 대조국전쟁이 끝났을떄, 그들의 전에 삶에 남아있던 행복도 승리한 독일인들한테 빼앗겼습니다. 1950년대의 서러시아 혁명전선의 군사적 실패와 그 이후의 몰락은 야조프같은 사람들이 더욱더 사고를 고정적으로 만들었습니다: 옛 소비에트 사령관들은 열정은 있었지만, 지도부는 필사적으로 신인이 필요했습니다. 어린 사람, 견고한 사람, 희생의 가치를 배웠고 직접 목격한 사람 말이죠.\n\n카르비셰프 동무가 그의 이상을 보기전에 쓰러지자, 그 짐은 이제 그의 제자였던 드미트리 야조프에게 떨어지게 되었습니다. 그의 전 스승과 다르게, 야조프는 실행하려는 의지와 체력이 있고, 그리고 이미 전국가를 전세계가 이제까지 경험해보지 못한 총력전을 준비할수 있는 형태로 변화시키고 있습니다. 그는 그의 인민들이 독일의 위협에 대한 복수를 위해 그들의 목숨을 포함한 모든것을 희생하길 예상하며, 그리고 많은 사람들이 그렇게 하길 원하고 있습니다. 아무것도, 심지어 핵무기의 불길로도, 그의 의지를 단념시키진 못할 것이며, 그리고 그는 자주 모든 독일인이 죽고 또 한 명 빼고 모든 러시아인이 죽어도, 승리가 될 것이라고 말합니다.\n\n옴스크가 잠에서 깨어나고 있고, 세계는 생각만으로도 두려워합니다."
 
 POLITICS_OMSK_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "트미트리 야조프는 죽었습니다. 흑색연합의 챔피언이자, 카르비셰프의 위대한 임무를 짊어진 사람은 더 이상 없습니다. 러시아에서 가장 성실한 군대를 이끌어 파시스트 짐승들을 물리치는 일에 선택된, 야조프는 자만심이 강하며 힘에 굶주린 군벌들을 통제하는데 실패하고 연합을 끔찍한 결말로 이끌어 버렸습니다. 러시아에서의 투쟁을 이끌어줄 지도자가 없어지자, 연합은 사라지고 서로 앙숙인 장교들의 무리가 되어, 카르비셰프의 위대한 유산을 가로채기에만 급급하고 그들을 묶어주는 목적은 잊어버린지 오래입니다.\n\n야조프의 죽음과 함께, §R대시련§!은 실패했습니다. 설령 몇몇 장군들이 그들의 무가치한 영지를 지키려 시도할지라도, 주변의 강력한 군벌의 의지가 전러시아 흑색연합의 잔당들을 지워버리는 데에는 충분할 겁니다."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_GRIGORIEV_DESC:0 "빅토르 안토노비치 그리고리예프는 다양한 성격의 소유자입니다: 용감하고, 대담하며, 확실하게도 기회주의자 입니다. 그가 그의 고향을 떠나서 붉은 군대의 부름을 듣고 들어왔을때, 그는 죽기살기로 싸웠으며, 동상에 걸린채로 전투를 치뤘으며 남아있는 적 탱크를 스스로 들이받기까지 했습니다. 그에게 남은 유일한 논리적 옵션은 흑색연합의 군대에 들어가 가망없는 싸움을 하는 거였지만, 그는 특별히 연합의 대의에 헌신하지 않았습니다.\n\n그리고리예프는 똑똑하게도 하급장교 치고는 세 서시베리아의 군벌들의 싸움에서 살아남았습니다. 죽음의 상인과의 전투 전까지는 말이죠. 그는 첫번째로 가라앉는 배를 버리고 적의 편에 섰습니다.\n\n그는 고향으로 돌아와서 굴욕을 당했지만, 그가 옴스크의 시장이자 군벌에 임명되는 데에는 걱정을 끼치지는 않았습니다. 그리고리예프는 아마도 우랄에 있는 정부의 꼭두각시일지는 몰라도 그는 말하길, 그가 계속 통제를 하고 있으면, 모든 것이 괜찮다고 말합니다."

 OMS_Dmitry_Yazov_hog:0 "드미트리 야조프"
 OMS_Dmitry_Yazov_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LWhat can be said of Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov, the protégé to the Black League's founder? Born in a backwater town near Omsk to a peasant family, Dmitry joined the Red Army at the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War at just seventeen. When the Germans caused the complete and utter rout of the Red Army, Dmitry was forced to make his way back to West Siberia and drawn to the new strength of Kaganovich's West Siberian People's Republic.\n\nHowever, like many military men in West Siberia, a black coal of hate formed in Yazov's heart for the Germans for what they had done to his Motherland. His dedication to the defence of Russia drew the eye of Dmitry Karbyshev, the general who would go on to break with Kaganovich and form the Black League. Dmitry, liking Yazov's intelligence and fanaticism to the cause of saving the motherland, took him in as his personal protégé. This caused Yazov to go with his mentor to Omsk when they finally declared independence from Kaganovich, and he became the right hand man to the older man.\n\nHowever, Yazov holds nothing but contempt for what he sees now. The people all around Karbyshev only pretend to believe in the cause of the Black League, using their mantle to do whatever the hell they please with Karbyshev too powerless to stop it. He swears to himself that he will make the old man proud, that Karbyshev's dream of a final §RGreat Trial§! with the Germans defeated once and for all. After all, he was Dmitry Yazov, and he would make sure his mentor's work was not in vain.§!"

 OMS_Aleksandr_Sakharovsky_for:0 "알렉산드르 사하로프스키"
 OMS_Aleksandr_Sakharovsky_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LA survivor of the Siege of Leningrad, Aleksandr Mikhailovich Sakharovsky is a man devoted to the Black League just as Yazov is. However, he is also the man responsible for ensuring the League maintains a "good face" on the world stage. Most people in the greater world could never truly understand the need for the League and the truths espoused by them. As such, he paints the League as a force for good, with them serving as a "protection force" against "the evils that threaten Russia and her children".\n\nUnder the table though, Aleksandr serves another purpose. As a former member of the NKVD, he was charged with aiding the League's sabotage and infiltration efforts in other warlords. After all, unlike many warlords in the Russian Anarchy, the leadership of the Black League realize that wars are not only won on the battlefield, but in the shadows. Omsk is the shadow state of Russia, and Aleksandr will guide its shadows with Yazov's guiding hand to victory.§!"
 
 OMS_Evgeny_Pitovranov_eco:0 "예브게니 피토브라노프"
 OMS_Evgeny_Pitovranov_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LEvgeny Petrovich Pitovranov was a man that seemed to have been prepared for a single, sole purpose: the preparation of the Black League's complete and total militarization for the Great Trial. In 1937, Pitovranov had joined the Communist Party while studying at the Russian University of Transport. In a year's time, he had been put in charge of NKVD operations in the Gorky region, being moved around various regions, working in tandem with the NKVD and the KGB to suppress dissent and ensure the pacification of settlements.\n\nAs the Soviet Union began to crumble, Pitovranov and his unit was redeployed west of the Urals, where they ultimately found themselves under the jurisdiction of the West Siberian People's Republic. Pitovranov and his unit became cogs in the Omsk Regional Directorate of the NKVD, during which time he became affiliated with the gradually-growing Black League.\n\nAs the West Siberian People's Republic collapsed, and Karbyshev's Black League seized the region of Omsk, Pitovranov was one of the first members to join the new administration. Since then, he has been tasked with the complete militarization of the Black League's territories - no small task - and one that he's carried out with the utmost proficiency.§!"
 
 OMS_Yuriy_Drozdov_sec:0 "유리 드로즈도프"
 OMS_Yuriy_Drozdov_sec_desc:0 "------------\n§LHate is all Yuri Ivanovich Drozdov knows now. He grew up with a caring family in Belarus, with a mother who was a part of the Belaruisan Secretariat and his father being a decorated war hero of the Polish-Soviet War. Yuri lost his parents during Operation Barbarossa when the Germans overran the city of Kharkiv where he was training to be an artillery officer. While plans were made to evacuate him to Aktobe, the Germans were too fast and he barely made it out of the city with his life. A fifteen-year-old now on the run, he headed to the only place where he thought he could bring the fight to the Germans: the West Siberian People's Republic. Taking over a year to reach it on foot with just a rifle and his uniform, he enlisted in the Republic's army.\n\nHowever, Kaganovich failed to truly prepare to fight the Germans in Yuri's eyes. This easily made him seduced by Karbyshev's new Black League which would truly keep Russia safe from the Germans. Deserting with many others in the Republic, he became an intelligence officer within the League, and began a friendship with Karbyshev's protégé, Dmitry Yazov.\n\nNow head of the Internal Security Directorate, Yuri has made it his goal to make sure the League never falls into the degeneracy it once did. He will ensure that everyone remains loyal to his friend and leader Yazov, and that there will be no dissent when the §RGreat Trial§! begins against the Germans. Yuri will avenge his country and his parents, no matter what it takes.§!"

Its peak looks down upon the earth, like an eye over every inch of land surrounding it. Dug into the crags, by its sides were Lysenko's laboratories, where he once contrived to experiment, to make supermen out of starving, dying subjects. The Black League does not have serious sympathies in Lysenko's theory; there is only so much cruelty that can be done in the name of science before it borders on idiocy.\n\nHowever, the research complexes have a potential. Built to withstand nuclear blasts, Lysenko's paranoia shall ensure a safe base of operations for the League's headquarters and high command. The Black Mountain shall be Black again, as the league drapes its cloak over its peak."

The Russian National Army, and its ranks lined by loyal men as well as women, serve the interests of the League far better than it can ask for. The leadership is secure in Black Mountain, but these soldiers need protection against the atomic retaliations of the Germans. The Glavkoverkh needs to shelter these soldiers through the harshness of the Fourth Thesis.\n\nWhen the time of burning comes, we shall give the Army the ultimate honor. Once the dust settles over quiet earth, and Russia is avenged, they shall climb out of their underground complexes. The flag of the League shall wave above the ruins of the Volkshalle, the symbol of Russia's ultimate triumph. Above a world of ashes, dust, and embers, blows aloft the ruins a Black flag, of victory."

Every day Karbyshev seemed a little smaller, a little weaker. Most days he didn't leave his bedroom, not even to go to his office down the hall. His voice barely rose above a whisper now, and he struggled to hold a pen to write with. All of these were concerning on their own, but they were not what disturbed Yazov.\n\nWhen he looked into Karbyshev's eyes he had once seen fire and passion. In the last few years that passion had gone, replaced with a grim determination that he still admired. But a few weeks ago he had noticed the determination had left his mentor's eyes too. Now there was something new. Acceptance. Karbyshev would never say it aloud, but Yazov knew his teacher had surrendered to his fate. He didn't want to believe that Karbyshev would allow himself to fade away into nothingness. The fire that had once burned within him must still exist somewhere inside. Every so often Yazov would try to coax some passion or excitement out of the old general, but he never succeeded. One day while they were both working in Karbyshev's bedroom, Yazov heard a small chuckle from behind him. He turned to see the frail man his teacher had become sitting up on his bed.\n\n"What is it sir?"\n\n"I was just thinking about my legacy, about what I'll be leaving the world with once I go on to whatever's next."\n\n"You'll have a wonderful legacy sir.

He smiled at the thought of those early days, when his vision had been so clear and the path towards national redemption seemed so obvious. He was overjoyed when many of his officers and old comrades volunteered to join the League and help him save the motherland. If only they had stayed true to their word and not fallen astray. Perhaps even then they had simply concealed their cynicism from him, and had always planned to use the League as a path to personal health and power. The old general prayed it wasn't so. He did not want to consider that so many of his friends might have always been this corrupt and power-hungry. But then, if the League had made them this way, was that any better?\n\nHe had spoken with Kharkhardin yesterday about the growing corruption in the League and what might be done about it. As always happened when he brought these things to Alexander, he was gently chastised for making mountains out of mole hills when there were more important issues to focus on. He didn't have the heart to tell Aleksander he knew that he was skimming money off the budget for his personal projects. It wouldn't have mattered if he had. Just like all of Karbyshev's other old friends, Kharkhardin seemed to think of him as more of a puppet than an ally these days, someone to prop up for the League while profiting off of its members.\n\nKarbyshev inserted a piece of paper into his typewriter and began to write another memo laying out a plan to eliminate corruption in the League's ranks. He knew it would be ignored. All of the others had been, but he could not give up now. His motherland needed him, and he would not abandon her, even if everyone else had."

Out there, in the blur of the distance, the shouts of men and gunfire rang in the air. Today, too, was a day of preparation for the Great Trial. Near him was an empty chair. Comrade Karbyshev was not here today. Yazov shook his head, brushing his face with a gloved hand. Thoughts of betrayal assailed the protégé's mind, only for a slight tremor in the air to banish them.\n\n"Your coffee, sir?" the steward said. Yazov gave him a faint smile. "Banish those forms of address, comrade. We are all equal to our duty," he said, "but yes, for now, I will take coffee." The steward gave a little bow, perhaps unused to the notion of equality among the ranks of the League, and laid down his cup in front of him. In the chilly morning air, wisps of steam trail the jet-black liquid. Yazov took it and held it in front of him, staring down at the cold, hard-set eyes reflected in those dark depths, letting the scent immerse him in the memories of things long gone. He took the rim to his lips and drank.\n\nThey flooded him in an instant, the rich aroma guiding him through the whirling pool of his mind. He remembered his first taste of coffee, from before the Fall. Then he came upon a scene of comrades breaking bread in the freezing weather of the winter battlefield, hearing the firewood crackle. He let an unseen tear gather in his eyes. They're all dead now. Yazov put his cup down, gritting his teeth. He held it out for a few moments, pondering whether to finish his drink. Against common sense, he did.\n\nHe found the fragrance guiding him away from the turmoil of the Great Patriotic War. Yazov drifted where it led him. Dearest Omsk, dearest homeland! He had sat in the cramped and huddled camps of refugees fleeing the west, the blood the Germans spilled staining even half the world away. He remembered the harsh and bitter coffee of that place and the dank and sour smell that surrounded him. At that precipice, the coffee ceased to be. Yazov stared at the bottom of the cup and smirked. Now was not the time to mourn, but the time for revenge."

Pitched battles with a reasonably determined enemy. However, they seemed to be no match for the firepower or determination of his soldiers. He allowed himself to be proud. This was progress. They were a real fighting force now, comparable and even superior to the best that Siberia could muster. Maybe it was time to rest his tired eyes. He removed his cap and tossed it onto the desk.

Half again as many were also wounded, and they were desperately low on all sorts of medical supplies. He didn't even feel angry at anyone in particular- in fact, his unit had performed quite well, holding their own and giving far worse than they got. But when the line falls, your unit falls with it, tough or not. If 102821 had been more active, or 205913 had held out a little longer...\n\nBut that was irrelevant.

Our scouts have reported they have withdrawn from the field completely and are heading east at full speed. Should we pursue them?"\n\n"I don't think so. They nearly overwhelmed us here. It's best not to push our luck. Tell your men to start counting casualties, ours and theirs. I want a report as soon as possible."\n\n"Yes sir."\n\nThe lieutenant scurried away and Fedorov turned back towards the grim view. He refused to let it show, but the way the Black League's soldiers had fought disturbed him. They came on relentlessly, with no concern for their lives. If he hadn't seen them bleed with his own eyes he would have been convinced they were robots. This had not been their full strength either.

Not a word was spoken among the men and women of the Black League as they marched their great General's body through their streets.\n\nThey marched for what seemed hours, out of the city proper and past the training fields, and all along the way; more and more people joined the march. For one night, they would put their differences aside. For one night, the entire Black League stood united in mourning. Eventually, they reached their destination.

He had given his life to build the Black League from nothing, but in his dogged efforts to save Russia, he had allowed the League to become reliant upon him to hold it together. Even with Yazov as his designated heir, the old generals had seized Karbyshev's passing as their opportunity to attempt to break free. Yazov knew that the League could not survive another succession crisis. Without him, the Black League would collapse from within and without. All of this would have been for nothing. Russia would be doomed.\n\nYazov resolved not to repeat the mistakes of his mentor. The Black League was bigger than any one man, and the motherland's salvation could not depend on him alone. What the League needed was reorganization, from top to bottom. The League would become an entity unto itself, even its most prominent members merely small parts of the great leviathan that would see Russia avenged. Yazov called his councillors and generals to his office. By the time they arrived he was already hard at work. They labored long into the night, until the plan was complete.\n\nThey sent out the first orders the very next day. Every officer of the Black League was to nominate a successor, to maintain the chain of command should he be incapacitated, and a secondary successor should his first choice be incapacitated as well. Every position from field marshal to sergeant would be required to have two levels of contingencies ready. The frontline troops would not be spared their share of the responsibility. It would be their duty to prepare themselves to fight without their officers, to continue the League's struggle even if their leaders could not. The soldiers would obey their commanders, but they would fight for the Black League, because as long as the Black League existed, Russia could never die."

Some days ago, when our dear comrade Supreme Commander Karbyshev passed, I was named his designated successor in his last will and testament." Somewhere in a bunker below Omsk, Yazov paused, knowing that he would now have to admit the unthinkable - there had nearly been a coup within the League.

And today, it has finally been excised."\n\n"In nature, there is no quarter for the weak, no mercy for those incapable of securing their own existence. The same is true in the affairs of human beings. We cannot, will not, must not let sentimentality, corruption, and favoritism come before our ultimate priority - ensuring that Russia has a future. We must make the Russian the apex predator of the Eurasian continent. In the coming days, I will speak to you again more and outline the changes that are in store.

Already our units have been placed on high alert and border patrols have been increased to prevent any more League agents from slipping into our territory.

The two cups sat in the cold, their steam streaming into the air in smooth wisps, before dissipating. He leaned back in his chair, growing sleepy as worry and concern faded from the creases of his face. Comrade Karbyshev was not so weak that a chilly wind could kill him. He would return and lead the League to glory. He squinted. Now was not the moment to grow complacent. What would the man think of him if he found Yazov dozing off before their appointed meeting?\n\nYazov sat up, his elbows on his knees, tapping his fingers as the hours passed and the day stretched to the evening. The cold breeze blew between the trees, and the training field grew silent as men trooped to dinner and other martial business. The stern clouds looked to the Earth and seemed to grow greyer and greyer in disappointment or wrath. Still, Karbyshev did not appear. He was old, however, and maybe his creaky joints made him late. Yazov laughed, but it was hollow. Aides and officers came out of the offices, begging him to return to his quarters. A storm grew in the distance, and the clouds grew stark, steely in outlook.\n\nThe sun went down, and snow fell. First in a gentle dusting, then as a thick, heavy blanket. The cool breeze became a frigid gale. The cool breeze became lashes of frozen air. Still, Yazov sat, waiting, his fingers clasped together, breathing with every shiver and shock.

One cadre, assigned to observation duty, moved to the shelter's periscope and, after a moment and with excitement breaking through the calm demeanor usually demanded, reported that the bombers were under attack by fighter aircraft.\n\nThe other cadres fought to remain still, though they all knew what that meant. The Aviators had arrived. Their instruction, reinforced daily, was clear: the Aviators were strictly unreliable elements. But even when delivered by dedicated officers, the enthusiasm with which lessons against the failures to the north or the great enemy to the west were delivered was not present. None truly held the Aviators, in their heart of hearts, as an enemy. How could they, when they fought, and killed, Germans on a near-daily basis?\n\nSeveral minutes later, the observer reported a damaged German bomber approaching the ground, on a trajectory for a crash landing, and the officer in charge asked for volunteers to venture out during the raid in search of prisoners. Every cadre present stood without hesitation, despite the danger. The Aviators might have shot the bomber down, but the task was not yet finished.\n\nIf any German had survived, they would soon wish they hadn't."

 omskgauntlet.1.desc:0 ""Gentlemen," Yazov intoned. "I am honored by your presence, and your willingness to listen to me." Of course, Yazov was perfectly aware that many of the men in the room would prefer to see him shot than listen to someone they regarded as an upstart firebrand. Yet, he carried on. "As the new Glavkoverkh of the Black League, I would like to make it clear how I intend to exercise my new role."\n\nYazov took a deep breath.\n\n"In the last days of our dearly departed comrade Karbyshev, there was no respect for authority among the higher ranks of our organization. Our founder, a living example of the principles we all seek to emulate, was ignored and regarded as little more than a figurehead. His wise counsel was spurned, and our mission corrupted by bureaucratic cliques."\n\nHe could see the discontent evident among some of the men seated before him. But he carried on. "While I have no intention to punish those responsible for this system, I certainly do not intend to let it continue." Yazov glanced to the side, at Sakharovsky and the others he had brought with him. "I have at my side a staff of eminently capable officers and generals, and with their help, as well as, I hope, yours, I intend to make this organization into something of which our dear Dmitry Mikhailovich would be proud."\n\nYazov had long imagined this moment and the satisfaction it might bring, the heady rush of making a fateful decision manifest with carefully-chosen words. But no such feeling came, and as Yazov met Abakumov's hateful beady-eyed stare, a sickening, head-spinning realization washed over him. There was no turning back now. The Rubicon had been crossed, and this was war."

 omskgauntlet.2.desc:0 ""Are you really sure about this sir?"\n\nYazov glared at the officer holding the new memo he had just finished typing. The young man seemed to shrink away from his gaze, clutching the piece of paper in front of himself like a pathetic shield.\n\n"Did I stutter, lieutenant?"\n\n"No no no. Of course not sir. It's just that... well... this seems exceptionally harsh to me. Dozens of executions. Hundreds of arrests. Some of these people are the most senior members of the League. Can we really afford to get rid of them?"\n\n"Every person on that list is a coward and a thief, and most of them are traitors too. The Black League has no place for them any more and we must show the members of the League what happens to those who obstruct our progress. Now I would encourage you to deliver that memo as fast as you possibly can if you don't want to be considered an obstructionist yourself."\n\nThe lieutenant opened his mouth to reply, then thought better of it, snapped a quick salute, and almost sprinted out the door. It brought Yazov a small amount of satisfaction to see the fear in the man's eyes. Respect was all well and good, but fear was the best way to ensure obedience. Karbyshev had been a wise man, but he had failed to realize that. He had placed his trust in people who had exploited and abused him. Yazov was not so forgiving, as those scum were about to find out."

 omskgauntlet.3.t:0 "The Low Overcomes the High"
 omskgauntlet.3.desc:0 ""Existence is subjugation." Yazov let this line hang in the air for a few seconds before carrying on. "It is the subjugation of reality to one's own desire to exist. Nothing can be achieved without such power, and without such power one lives only at the mercy of those who are stronger. As grim a reality as it may be, we must recognize that there is no inherent right to existence, to life. We can only rely on ourselves."\n\n"The simple fact is this - ideals have failed Russia. It is systems of ideals that place unworthy people in positions of power. In the First World War, Russians bled and died for the sake of an incompetent man who had done nothing to merit leadership. In the Second, they did the same, only for different men. We have seen the products of such systems and paid the price for their failures. But no more." Yazov paused. He knew what was coming. His stomach clenched, but he knew there was no other way. It was what Karbyshev would have wanted. This is what he had to be.\n\n"The Black League's sole objective is the survival of Russia in the face of the coming Trial. To do this, we cannot make the same mistakes as our predecessors. Going forward, weakness in leadership will not be tolerated. I am hereby issuing a decree allowing the removal from command of ineffective officers. From this day forward, any official - no matter how high-ranking - can be brought before a court-martial by the consent of ten of his direct subordinates and another officer. The lawless wasteland permits only the strong to survive. We will bring this principle into our leadership, in order that the new Russia we are building may be sharpened into a weapon which no amount of German bombs can break. We must make the Russian the apex predator of the Eurasian continent. This is your commander speaking. Our cause is just. Victory will be ours. Good night.""

Seeking the overthrow of newly-minted Supreme Commander Yazov, the officer cliques have seized control of both towns in what is a clear bid to take command of the whole of the Black League. While there is undoubtedly some reason being used by the officers to justify their revolt, at this time, no formal statement has been issued. In any case, such a pretext matters little - Yazov has made his intention to remove these aging, "inefficient" officers eminently clear, and it can be assumed that the mutineers are fighting first and foremost for their own careers.\n\nExactly who is in command of the revolt is unclear. While the uprising in Isilkul is reportedly headed by one General V.S. Abakumov, an NKVD veteran who joined the Black League in its early days, it is still uncertain who, if anyone, is actually leading the rebellion in Tara. Regardless, this turn of events represents a dire situation for the Black League as a whole, and it seems that the whole organization now hangs from the precipice."

He sent the aide out of the room with a wave of his hand as his mind roiled.\n\nIf only Karbyshev were here. I'm not ready for this, he thought, before swatting that errant thought out of his mind. Truth be told, while on the exterior he was quite adept at putting forth a brave face, within the pressure was nearly overwhelming. He couldn't help but feel like a child dressed up in his father's work clothes, the weight of the world on his unready shoulders.\n\nThese thoughts were interrupted when General Sakharovsky burst in.\n\n"Glavkoverkh," he said breathlessly. "We have work to do."\n\n"So it would seem, Alexander Mikhailovich," Yazov replied, trying his best to exude the confidence that he lacked as he stood up from his desk and gathered his things. "Mobilize everyone we've got. Even the RSBs. Lock down the city. Once we're in control, we plan our next move." Sakharovsky nodded, and summoned an aide. Yazov felt decisive. He imagined himself like Karbyshev, always in control, ready to run the gauntlet and come out unscathed.\n\nBut within, he had no idea what was going to happen next."

The shattered bones of an old world painted across the horizon, reaching up to the heavens, but forever trapped with the discarded people who had built them in a past age.\n\nBut, overtop of the city, a layer of atmosphere was brushed thick - air raid sirens painted it in broad strokes of oppression and fear. The wash of crackled words, murmured through half-broken speakers demanding the citizens return to their homes, mixed anxiety into the palette.\n\nLower down, in the dark bowels of the city, the composition was ongoing; thousands of dark-clothed oppressors, each one a brush, painted their heavy boots across the streets.\n\nAll those wide eyed rabble viewing the great scene from their windows could do nothing but accept the artistry before them.\n\nYazov had become the grand painter of the city, perhaps all of Russia.

He sat, cramped against the spall lining, his eyes unfocused and staring into infinity.\n\nHe had lost. He hadn't been ready for this. For any of it. He thought back to the fear he had felt going into this grand venture, and he saw it reflected in the eyes of the men around him. His head sunk, unable to meet their stares.\n\nA shout, then the screech of tires and an explosion. The world collapsed inwards, and then gave way as the vehicle's armored carapace broke open around Yazov, the world spinning before his slackened eyes. For a moment, he was conscious once again, the world still and in perfect clarity. He marveled at how bright red his own blood was, how elegantly the flames danced on the APC's remains.

Every officer in the League must now watch their back and work their hardest, lest they fall prey to the newly-instituted "efficiency investigations" and find themselves demoted, or worse.

Not physically - it was cramped, damp, and smelled of mold, but in a more existential sense. This kind of war - the kind he now felt himself immersed in - was something he could rationalize and understand. The last few weeks of chaos and civil disorder had been a disorienting, vertigo-inducing sequence of events for Innokentiy, a veteran of the failed effort to reclaim West Russia in the 1950s. The war that was now being fought was nothing like the one he had seen waged ten years ago. The conflict within the Black League came and went in fits and starts, with brief engagements interspersed within long, endless hours and days of tension and speculation. The front lines seemed to appear and disappear at will, as political machinations within the higher ranks made foes suddenly become friends and vice versa. Rarely could Innokentiy enjoy the adrenaline rush of a straight fight, or the feeling of a well-executed infiltration. But today was such a day, and, as he looked at the bunker complex a few broken city blocks away, he couldn't help but feel quite pleased with himself.\n\nA distant "thud" from within the compound let Innokentiy know that his work had come to bloody fruition, in one way or another. The handoff of the explosive-laden briefcase last night had gone off without a hitch, and it seemed that his contact had successfully set off the device, at least. It wasn't until the appointed signal - a staccato series of six gunshots, in groups of threes, that Innokentiy knew that Viktor Abakumov was dead."

An NKVD man who found Karbyshev's ideal of a strengthened and renewed Russia attractive for all the wrong reasons, it is unlikely that many outside of the officer cliques he held together will mourn his passing.\n\nWithin hours of Abakumov's death, tensions among his shellshocked co-conspirators seem to have boiled over into open warfare, and with gunfire reported inside of Isilkul, Black League units were able to sweep in and mop up any remaining resistance with relative ease. Yazov's dream lives on for another day, but there is no rest yet for the Glavkoverkh - a revolt still festers in Tara."

For a moment, he was back at Volokolamsk in 1940, fighting a losing battle against the oncoming German tide. And then, a moment later, he was on the outskirts of Tara once more, distant gunfire beating out a harsh tattoo in his ears.\n\nCadre Leader Pavlov's cohort was certainly not used to actual frontline combat, let alone against men who had until recently been their sworn comrades-in-arms. Then again, combat wasn't exactly in their job description - Pavlov's cadre was a reserve cadre, known in Black League parlance as a "chetvyorka," or "four," due to the fact that their six-digit designation began with that number. Normally, such units, often composed of older soldiers seen as being past their prime, were relegated to the duties of keeping the non-League members in line, and making sure that the civilians stayed quiet and met their production quotas.\n\nBut today, as had the days before it, had not been an ordinary day. As he broke down the door of a grey, dreary civilian dwelling with a few chosen subordinates, Pavlov reflected on how utterly unthinkable this situation would have been only a few months ago. Men he once would have died to save were now his mortal enemies. With a splash of dust, the rotten door split open, termites wriggling from its fragments on the ground as the reservists rushed in and corralled the building's occupants. The civilians cowered before him and his black-uniformed men with a practiced ease sharpened by years of living under the Black League's "protection." As usual, it didn't take much to make them comply - the end of a PPSh was excellent for loosening a person's tongue. Moments later, Pavlov had the target's location, and had rejoined the rest of his cadre back on the dusty road. The ring around Tara was almost complete."

While the news of Abakumov's death and the collapse of the Isilkul putsch seems to have not fazed the Tara conspirators, the defeat of Old Guard forces and the subsequent encirclement of the city certainly has.\n\nThe revolt's leaders have now run up the white flag of truce, and have agreed to surrender to Yazov's forces in exchange for any potential death sentences being commuted to Redemptionary Service, though it remains unclear whether the Glavkoverkh actually intends to honor this pledge.

To the Gauntlet, and how he had been decisive and strong. Like Karbyshev. He'd just do his speech, and forget about the fear.\n\n"Comrade soldiers," Yazov began, using that familiar phrase that Karbyshev had been so fond of. "Today, by proving our strength, we prove our worthiness to rule Russia. Your deeds today will prove the fundamental nature of the universe - the strong rule, and the weak perish. Your deeds will prove that WE, the All-Russian Black League, are the sole salvation of this nation and its millennium of civilization. So, though today you may fight your own countrymen, fight as if you were facing down the Führer himself! Because if we fail today, there IS no tomorrow, and Russia will perish once and for all at the hands of the superpowers when the Great Trial comes. So go forth, and carve your names into history!" Yazov was satisfied with his delivery, and a cheer broke out. And now, the final, personal touch that was uniquely his. "Our cause is just," he shouted to further cheers, giving voice once more to those words he had heard on the radio when it all began in 1941. "The enemy will be destroyed.

About fifty meters out into that grassland was an invisible line, the line that separated the All-Russian Black League from the traitors and cowards that sought to undermine Russia. Borders were a fluid and often fanciful concept in Russia nowadays, but according to the map they had, the line was out there and they were not to cross it. Not yet, anyway.\n\nTechnically there were no plans for war with the Bolshevik scoundrels in Tyumen, and any talk of such was a rumor started by the men. Technically Combat Cadre 154376, along with almost every other combat cadre in the League, had been moved to the border as part of a training exercise. The order to be combat-ready at all times had nothing to do with the escalating border clashes between the League and the communists to the north. Officially everything was business as usual, but the simple fact that the cadre commanders were making no effort to silence talk among the ranks of an invasion was enough proof for everyone. War was coming.\n\nStaring out into the predawn darkness, Andrei couldn't help but be excited. He knew that he shouldn't be, after all it was his fellow Russians he would be going into battle against, but he had trained for war since he was 14 years old.

The lines of fortified gun emplacements, trenches, and minefields stretch from the borders of the League all the way back to its heart in Omsk. The very landscape of western Siberia has been weaponized against all outside intrusion.\n\nAs Karbyshev's influence weakened, the squabbling generals of the old guard grew lax in their maintenance of these mighty fortifications. They only cared for the defences that protected their personal holdings, thinking exclusively of themselves and not of Russia's needs. Only when Yazov vanquished the traitors did he realize the sorry state the defences were in. He had reunified the League and its territory, and now that he had consolidated his control he would not lose it to an outside invader.\n\nAs the league prepares for war every step has been taken to make sure the home front is ready. The Last Trial has taught the Russian people that they must expect the war to come to them, and under the Black League's guidance they will be ready if it does. The league has conscripted everyone within its borders to restore the fortifications in and around Omsk. Trenches are deepened and reinforced. Old bunkers are cleaned out and refitted. Anti-air crews reposition their guns towards the border to counter an aerial opponent. As Russia's reclamation draws near the anticipation in Omsk is palpable. These last weeks of preparation will decide Russia's fate. Yazov and the rest of the Black League refuse to cede a single inch of Russian soil to the enemy uncontested."

His heart thrummed in anticipation. His breath caught when Igor stood up from his bunk at the other end of the lodge. Just as planned. The guard on that end sneered at Igor and drew his gun. Roman gripped his shiv.\n\nRoman slid out of bed and threw all of his weight into the second guard. Roman wrestled with him for a few seconds before he plunged the shiv into the guard's neck and held him down until he stopped moving. He stood, his legs weak. The other guard was a bloody pulp on the ground by the time he hobbled over. Igor grabbed the keys and started on the lock. Roman looked around at the other prisoners. "You are free now. Go, run! Die as free men! The Marshal is with you!" Roman said before he and Igor slipped outside.\n\nMakar's lodge was down the road. He was waiting outside, his pudgy face speckled with blood. "W-we have to move. They will hunt us. Quickly, now!" They ran, scampering through the Vorkutlag like rats. Alarms blared all around. Bare feet pounded on gravel. Guards shouted. The hole in the fence was just up ahead. Dogs barked. Gunshots from everywhere and nowhere. Makar pushed Igor aside and dove for the hole. Roman looked around. Flash. He was blind. The searchlight was on them. The loudspeaker screeched in fury. Makar blubbered. The hole was too small for him. Too small for any of them. The game was over. Roman's heart sank.

And soon his brain would join them and he would be dead. But he would also be free from Vorkuta. He couldn't wait.\n\nHe trudged through the endless ice and snow, rifle in hand. He shivered and pulled his thin overcoat tight to his body, shifting his backpack from one shoulder to the other. The wind stabbed at him like a driven nail. None of what he was given was meant for weather like this. His coat and hat were too thin and his boots were waterlogged. He felt naked. The exercise was simple: make it back to Vorkuta. The only problem was his numb fingers dropped the compass the first time he took it out. It shattered and without that, his map was useless. So he started walking in the vague direction of home. That was... one or two days ago. Sunlight was scarce above the Arctic Circle; he only got two or three hours at best. That left him with pain and the cold.\n\nA loose chunk of ice brought his boot out from under him. He put his free hand out to break his fall and landed hard on his arm, twisting his hand to the side further than nature would allow. Snap. An involuntary scream burst from his throat as he rolled onto his back. Staggering to his feet, he glanced at the brown-red stain spreading down his sleeve, and kept walking. Between the pain hammering his brain and his great, heaving breaths, a realization dawned on him. No man could survive this. This was a culling. The weak would freeze and the strong would rise. He repeated that in his head as the black flesh in his extremities spread and the sun sank once again below the Arctic horizon."

The pair nodded and silently rolled away the latest unfortunate to die under interrogation.\n\nWhen they returned five minutes later, the ISD officers were carrying a young man in a soiled Red Army uniform between them.

"This him, sir?" asked Luka, spitting away the end of his cigarette.\n\nKazimir ran a finger down the list to find the name again, glancing at the captive to see if the description fit. "Seventeen or eighteen, red hair, narrow jaw, corporal's stripes... Yeah, that's probably him." He jerked his head in the direction of the interview rooms. "Alright, back to it."\n\nThe officers moved towards the hallway, but Maksim stopped beside Kazimir's desk, looking thoughtful for a moment. The senior officer glanced up at his subordinate with a frown. "Problem, Sergeant?" he asked.\n\nMaksim shook his head. "No, sir, sorry, I was just thinking... We need new drill bits.

In Yazov, the Black League had its Menelaus: a relentless pursuer of vengeance, possessed of an iron will and willing to pay any price for the salvation of that which he loved the most.\n\nHowever, Yazov knew in his heart that his mission - to fulfil the sacred destiny of Russia - would never get any easier. There was always another false claimant to the epithet of 'legitimate government'. It was in the nature of the League to never be understood by lesser men. Even come the Great Trial, Russia would still be crawling with turncoats and faint-hearted pacifists who refused to see the purity and valor of his hate. There was only one answer: an iron boot, perpetually grinding them into the dirt while its wearer conducted the symphony of war.\n\nFor today Yazov had his triumph, but tomorrow?

 omskbatov.1.d:0 "Reports continue to come in of attacks by men of a rogue militant group led by the heinous former Sverdlovsk military junta leader Pavel Batov, as forces reportedly loyal to him have spontaneously led uprisings in several key cities against our rightful government. In Sverdlovsk and Tyumen, these rebels have succeeded in forcing out our local garrisons and now have proclaimed the Russian National Salvation Commission from their headquarters in Sverdlovsk.\n\nWe have succeeded in identifying several key characters of the rebellion, among them Karbyshev's daughter, Yelena Karbysheva, a great betrayal. Ivan Bagramyan, a prominent figure in subjugated Sverdlovsk, has reportedly joined the rebels along with Ernest Voznesensky from Tyumen and Hamazasp Babadzhdanian of Sverdlovsk. All evidence points towards these individuals working together in planning this.\n\nPavel Batov is known for his skill in military organization and strategy, which explains the dangerous success of his movement in such a short time. His ability to manage Sverdlovsk for as long as he did is a testament to such abilities, and we believe that without this competent "head" the rebellion is doomed to fail, making him a key target. The traitor Yelena Karbysheva acts as the head of inter-state affairs and is already reaching out to our rivals for support, and her close personal history with our former leader makes her especially dangerous as well. Ivan Bagramyan and Hamazasp Babadzhdanian are both former Soviet generals who served in the First Trial but now find themselves opposing us.\n\nWe must act quickly to ensure the early death of the rebellion! While they are weaker than us now, they have the advantage of fighting on ground where the foolish population supports them, and unless we move to wipe them out who knows how strong they will grow..."

 omskbatov.2.t:0 "작전명: 나이트폴"
 omskbatov.2.d:0 "Nikolay peered at the compound through his sniper scope, the grey tenement appearing bulbous and discombobulated around the edges. Its facade might as well be Marshal Batov's tomb-stone: the Black League had tracked the insurgent to his corner, where he can no longer escape. Still, it appeared magnificent - the sandbags on every window, machine guns polished to glinting in the early morning sun. Pavel Batov had chosen not to go with a whimper, but a statement. Nikolay liked that, even if the Marshal was a traitor to the motherland.\n\nCrackling on the radio. Nikolay took and lit his final cigarette before the operation began. To steady his hands, as he stated to his superiors. Optimally he would have also requested a can of coffee beans and a reclining chair, but he digressed. He was growing sarcastic of the proceedings in the League. At least it was good pay and good food. They paid high rates for snipers - both against them and with them.\n\nIn the distance, a faint explosion boomed through the air, its reverberance barely halting before a whistling sounded. Then, an earth-shattering boom. Black League troops, dressed in camouflage, took this as their signal. In waves and waves, they advanced against the grey tomb, as machine-guns turned their lambent gaze to perforate their bodies with lead. More mortar shells, more troops, more guns, until the rapid gunfire halted, replaced with sporadic, pathetic pops.\n\nBatov stepped out from the backside of the building, alone, unguarded. Here was Nikolay's quarry: the former Marshal of the West Siberian Military District. With one press of a trigger, he let loose a bullet that would nail Batov in the shoulder. Three Black League troops followed him, but he pulled his trusty Tokarev, and shot, shot, shot. It all happened too quickly for Nikolay to follow, but when he set to finish the Marshal off, he halted.\n\nHe saw Batov crawl over the concrete pavement, a single hand scaling a gravity-less cliff, blood trailing behind him. Soon, he would stop, and his head would sag. He was dead."

 omskbatov.3.t:0 "The Daughter's End"
 omskbatov.3.d:0 "Yelena Karbysheva was not a woman of weak convictions. Daughter of the legendary Black League leader Dmitry Karbyshev, she had gone through the entirety of her childhood under her father's vision - which she now embraced. If only he were still here, she thought to herself as her loyalists and the remnants of Batov's men sped her into the nearest car bound for West Russia, perhaps they would not be in so much trouble.\n\nShe remembered how he was in his final days: mind addled with disappointment and body inhibited by a cold, mysterious sickness. Yelena left him not long after.\n\nThey brought her to an open-topped military car, ready for her perusal. Perhaps, out there in the west, she can find refuge and bring news of the madman Yazov's plans. The Black League had betrayed her father's beliefs. She did not want to rule nor take power; she only saw what love had powered, now only hate ruled. Seated at the back of the car, she saw the buildings and tenements of the small town and vowed to return.\n\nThen her chauffeur turned the engines on and pressed the gas pedal. The car did not roar alive, instead, only a click, and a ticking.\n\nBefore she could warn and get out of it, she was consumed by the flames and the inferno."

 omskbatov.4.d:0 "Gunshots. The screech of tires. Fear. The crunch of approaching boots on rough gravel.\n\nIt was the end of the line, whispered a voice in the back of Yazov's head.\n\nThe command car was in disarray. Someone - maybe Sakharovsky - was slumped forwards, blood tricking weakly from the base of his skull. The driver was smashed through the front window. The once-mighty Glavkoverkh sat sprawled on top of - or maybe it was under - one of the car's seats, his limbs twisted into some pattern he couldn't quite comprehend through the adrenaline fog. Something kept him warm - it could have been blood, but he wasn't sure.\n\nThe crunch of footsteps outside and the shouts of insurgents sounded his requiem. His primal instincts screamed at him, pleading with him to run, defend himself, anything. But something within the Glavkoverkh was simply done, vanquished, spent. This wasn't a heroic or memorable death. But, fate had made it his.\n\nA face - or was it two? - suddenly loomed in the smashed window, indistinct and blurry to Yazov's unfocused eyes. Some indeterminate sounds echoed in the distance, but Yazov was no longer interested. A cold, silent paralysis began to grip him, and his thoughts grew indistinct, incomprehensible even to himself. His own head grew distant, numb, his consciousness shrinking and shrinking and receding back away from his eyes into a single, infinitesimal point, until, somewhere, the last stirrings of life within Dmitry Timofeyevich Yazov fell silent."

 omskbatov.5.t:0 "A Word of Warning"
 omskbatov.5.d:0 ""Any reports from the outlying territories?" Evgeny Savintsev stood by a radio operator in the depths of the Black League's headquarters. "I need information. Now." He was probably pressuring the young man too hard for situations outside both of their control, but if there was hope, Savintsev hoped to be the first one to hear it. He could hear the buzzing of the ham radio, as Black League personnel scramble frantically through all the radio channels available to them.\n\n"Nothing, sir," the young man said to him, face pale. "Nothing at all. I have tried contacting the bases in Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, everything. No response." Under Savintsev's steady and skeptical gaze, his resolve seemed to melt. Perhaps he did find something after all, buried in the recesses of his mind.\n\n"Are you sure?"\n\n"Y-yes, sir. Although..."\n\n"Although? Please be straight with me, soldier."\n\n"There was an unencrypted radio signal that one of the other radiomen found. He said that he was going to pass it up straight to you, but I guess he didn't." His voice quietened into a whimper. "The contents might upset you, so I stayed quiet."\n\n"Tell me."\n\n"It was a message, from Sverdlovsk." The boy swallowed. "It said," finding a piece of paper, he wrote: YOUR ARMIES LAY CRUSHED YOUR GLAVKOVERKH IS DEAD RUSSIA CONDEMNS YOUR EVIL. "And no message after.""
 omskbatov.5.a:0 ""Dismissed, soldier.""

 omskbatov.6.t:0 "Unity in Purpose"
 omskbatov.6.d:0 ""So did you really send that message, sergeant?" Batov said, his tone jocular and full of cheerfulness. One could not guess as to whether he had sent a prank or a death threat. In a compound near Sverdlovsk, Batov's resistance force gathered, a hodge-podge of men and women in varying states of combat readiness. Batov could tell you stories of that one recruit who showed up wearing a metal pan for a helmet for days. Still, everyone there was united in a singular purpose: to rage against the dark, to triumph over the Black League.\n\n"Hell yeah, I did, sir!" Batov admired that sort of enthusiasm. Military work was, at the same time, ludicrous and dull. It was dry one moment and the next you could be paddling up a creek, knee-deep in blood. A spot of comedy and humor could help one get used to it quicker. Pavel patted the sergeant's shoulders and dismissed him.\n\nEntering his inner "office," he saw his high-ranked officers gathered before him. Ivan Bagramyan, trusted quartermaster. Yelena, daughter of Karbyshev. Ernest Voznesensky, the old economic official he had inherited from Kaganovich. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, stranger in a strange land.\n\nHis grin slowly hardened into a stern visage. "Bagramyan, I want you to prepare the government. Yelena, I need you to establish contact with Black League rebels. Voznesensky, handle the infrastructure. Babadzhanian, make sure everything goes smoothly." They looked at him, their eyes flashing with hope and energy. He had to be stern, but he allowed himself to smile."

 omskbatov.7.t:0 "The Fall of the Black League"
 omskbatov.7.d:0 "For months the forces of the West Siberian Provisional Authority and the Russian National Salvation Commission have battled across the war-torn landscape of western Siberia. Little by little, the underground army has pushed back the forces of the Black League, reducing the areas where its soldiers could operate safely and striking from the shadows when they were least expected. The commanders of the Black League convinced themselves that this was just another partisan organization, larger and more organized than most, but they would still be crushed. That lie became harder and harder to believe as the League's authority continued to evaporate outside of its strongholds, but the tipping point came with Yazov's assassination.\n\nWith the head of the Black League cut off, its weakness was made plain for all to see. The illusion of total control was broken and could never be repaired. Massive uprisings took place and the Salvation Commission launched an organized military uprising, seizing control over much of western Siberia. Now the surviving officers of the Black League have taken shelter in Omsk once again. They are desperately trying to contact their remaining forces scattered across their former territory. Only a holdout garrison in Vorkuta has responded. Everyone else is either already dead or simply saw which way the wind is blowing and decided not to go down with the ship.\n\nIn the tunnels and bunkers of Omsk desperate plans are being drawn up to retake western Siberia and continue the Black League's mission, but all but the most deluded officers know this is a mere fantasy borne out of panic more than anything else. The Black League is done, its mission is a failure. Russia may still be unified one day, but it will not be under Yazov's vision. The only thing left for the League to do is quietly die out like so many dreams before it."

 omskbatov.8.t:0 "작전명: 용의 둥지"
 omskbatov.8.d:0 "After weeks of preparation, the crackdown on the insurgents within Zlatoust has begun. In the predawn hours this morning hundreds of officers from the directorate of state security descended upon the city, backed by several battalions of infantry. The officers went door to door, arresting anyone suspected of working for the so-called "Russian National Salvation Commission." The main targets were the local leaders of the insurgency, especially those who were operating from within the city government itself. Most of the suspects were caught off guard and apprehended without incident. A few attempted to run but were quickly caught or gunned down. Others chose to take their own life rather than surrender, saving the directorate the trouble of dealing with them. By the time the sun was up, hundreds were behind bars, dozens were dead, and most of the city had been secured.\n\nA few of the rebel leaders got word of what was happening and attempted to make their escape. Realizing the city was surrounded, they rallied their supporters, three dozen men and women in total, and took control of a warehouse on the edge of Zlatoust. The staff of the warehouse were taken hostage, and the rebels used the weapons and materials stockpiled within to fortify their position. The 29th League Infantry Battalion surrounded the warehouse, cutting off all means of escape, but was instructed not to storm the position to avoid unnecessary casualties. What resulted was a multi-hour standoff that lasted into the evening. Eventually it was decided that the warehouse and its contents were expendable, and an airstrike destroyed the building and everyone inside of it. The city is now firmly under our control once more."

 omskbatov.9.t:0 "작전명: 연기 구덩이"
 omskbatov.9.d:0 "The city of Chelyabinsk has become a hotbed of resistance to the Black league in recent months. The efforts of Batov's terrorists have turned the city into a miniature warzone, with frequent bombings and hit-and-run ambushes against the city's garrison. Increasing the number of soldiers present in the city has only resulted in a rise in attacks against them. To prevent the situation from devolving further into chaos it was decided that a new approach should be tried. Intelligence officers and secret police have spent the last weeks infiltrating terrorist cells throughout the city, locating their safehouses and warning of planned attacks. These agents have uncovered a network of partisans that extends across the whole city and even into the surrounding villages. With their entire organization laid bare, a more permanent solution was now available.\n\nThis afternoon, the spy's work bore fruit. As the rebels prepared for a series of coordinated strikes, their units were suddenly ambushed by well concealed soldiers of the city garrison. By the time the partisans realized their cover had been blown it was too late. Dozens of partisan soldiers were killed in the first wave of counter-ambushes, and before their commanders could mount an effective response they found their safehouses had been exposed. Combat cadres across the city dragged hundreds of terrorists out of their safe rooms and bolt holes. A few surrendered but most fought to the death. By the day's end the tally was 254 dead terrorists, including every member of the Chelyabinsk partisan command, 133 in custody, and 13 dead League soldiers. The spine of the resistance in Chelyabinsk has been broken. Those terrorists who remain free will either submit to the inevitable or continue their doomed struggle. Without their commanders to guide their treachery it will not be long until we catch them."

 omskbatov.10.t:0 "작전명: 부셔진 강철"
 omskbatov.10.d:0 "Tyumen, once the capital of the West Siberian People's Republic, is now the home of one of the most active branches of Batov's insurgent movement against the Black League. Paranoia has gripped the city with rumors of partisan infiltration and disloyalty within the government spreading like wildfire. It seems everyone from the mayor to the custodian who sweeps his office is under suspicion, and there is no way of knowing who can be trusted. That is, until a month ago when a partisan commander Shadrinsk wasn't quick enough with her cyanide pill and fell into the hands of our interrogators. She held out for a remarkably long time, but everyone cracks eventually. She provided a list of names that, while not comprehensive, gave the garrison of Tyumen something real to work from.\n\nSoon a few officials from the mayor's office simply vanished without any explanation. These men did not provide any information of use, but their disappearance caused a panic among the partisans. All it took was a few days of observation to find which government employees were sweating under the pressure, then placing some tails on them to find out what they had to hide. Soon the Directorate of State Security had a list of dozens of names, and the real purge could begin.\n\nNow the terrorists are running scared. Most of their leaders have been arrested or disappeared without a trace. With the local leadership exposed, the footsoldiers are running for the hills, all their grandiose plans for an uprising now nothing more than dreams. Order has been restored to Tyumen and a major blow has been dealt to Batov's criminal organization.\n\nSurprisingly, the mayor had no involvement whatsoever."
 omskbatov.10.a:0 "The cowards run because they know they cannot hide."

 omskbatov.11.t:0 "작전명: 귀향"
 omskbatov.11.d:0 "It has long been suspected that Pavel Batov, the treacherous leader of the insurgency plaguing the League, has hidden somewhere on the outskirts of Sverdlovsk. The city was the former headquarters of the military clique that Batov belonged to, and even after it was reclaimed by the League it remained a hotspot of terrorism and sabotage. The local garrison has struggled to pacify the region around the city and recently reported there was a serious risk of being forced to abandon their positions in the face of escalating attacks if they were not reinforced. In response, a full division was ordered to the city to destroy the rebellion once and for all. Word of their impending arrival reached the city before they did, and the local rebels launched a full rebellion. By the time the division arrived the city had devolved into a war zone and the local garrison was besieged inside city hall and their fortified barracks.\n\nWith no possibility of a sudden citywide sweep that would catch the rebels off guard, the division commander adopted a new strategy. Combat squads entered the city ready to clear it house by house. Intense street fighting quickly enveloped Sverdlovsk, but the uprising had been hastily organized and began abruptly before the rebels were organized. They were no match for the disciplined forces of the Black League and by the end of the first day most of the garrison had been relieved and the city center was secure. It took several more days before the outskirts were recaptured, but by that time most of the partisans were on the run, their loyalty to their officers vanishing as soon as they realized they were losing. No sign was found of Batov, though a hidden command post that he may have stayed in was uncovered. The city suffered significant damage during the fighting, but with the rebels forced out restoring order should be an easier task than before."

 omskbatov.12.t:0 "A Lost Connection"
 omskbatov.12.d:0 "Yazov watched the march-past as all commanders were expected to do; with all the efficiency of a gear turning against another the contingents, row by row, filed past him. He'd long since grown weary of these formalities: with every contingent that saluted him came another fifty to sixty men who weren't on duty against the Menace. Another company lost to the pointlessness of display, of an indulgence so polished it almost escaped notice.\n\nThe messenger hesitated by his ear, and Yazov started. Calming himself, he snapped: "What is it? Be quick, I'm on duty."\n\n"The daughter of Karbyshev has been found." Yazov's face froze. He whispered to his fellow general and bounded away from the procession. "Where has she been found? I must know." She was the daughter of his mentor; she was owed that much, one last kindness for the man he'd never said goodbye to. But how to tell her about her father? That he'd wandered off into the forest like an old boar looking for one last fight? Oh, his head spun so - but there was so much to do -\n\nA cold certainty began to slip into his gaze, and puzzle pieces fell together in his mind. "You didn't find her. You found her handiwork." The messenger looked away, his fists clenched white. "We have credible information she's working with Batov. A People's Popular - something."\n\nSomething died in Yazov's eyes. She'd turned into a disappointment. Saying nothing, he stalked back to his procession. At least there was one thing worth celebrating."
 omskbatov.12.a:0 "Her father never lived to witness her disgrace."

 omskbatov.13.t:0 "A Sense of Closure, Or..."
 omskbatov.13.d:0 "Yazov stared at the dossier. It was thin, as were all files belonging to enemies of the Black League: the Black Hand knew the bare minimum necessary for strategic action, or they had already brought an abrupt end to their careers. In any case, there was little need to maintain extended correspondence. Most of the time the dossiers were also anonymous - why pretend these people mattered in more than purely operational capacities?\n\nNot this folder, however. This one was earmarked by Yazov himself, and in the days since he'd authorised offensive action against its subject he'd come again and again to its pages. How could he not? The dossier belonged to the daughter of his greatest influence, his second father - his enemy, and now an anonymous corpse officially buried in an anonymous grave.\n\nHe flicked open the pages, poring over the details; where had it gone wrong? Surely there had been some imagined slight, some magnified transgression that swallowed them both, broke father from child - there had to be. What had happened to them? If things had gone differently, would Karbysheva now be standing in Yazov's place, fighting for the Iron Dream of Russia born anew?\n\nAnd how best to honor a daughter who had died fighting her father's greatest dream? Yazov had never found the answer to that satisfactory. So he had come up with his own - as he grasped the pages of the dossier, he prayed that he'd done the right thing.\n\nThat night, the Government of Omsk announced a planned renewal of the Founder's Memorial, in the City Centre; repairs took a day to complete. If a coffin, with a dossier placed atop it, made its way to the Memorial, no one took notice - and if it did not emerge come the morning, when the Memorial was resealed, there was nary a peep."
 omskbatov.13.a:0 "I do this for you, General."
 
 omskbatov.14.t:0 "A Tangible Threat"
 omskbatov.14.d:0 "Glavkoverkh Dmitry Yazov was rarely able to enjoy time to himself. His indispensable duties to the safety and preservation of the motherland were all-consuming, and although Yazov remained staunchly committed to his work to a degree some would consider unhealthy, even he understood the importance of the quiet moments.\n\nAs he flipped through the pages of a fiction novel he had been working his way through the past few weeks, a rather vintage gramophone played old tunes from before the many tragedies that had befallen Russia. He wondered if there would be a place for such art in his new Russia.\n\nBefore he could follow this line of thinking further, however, felt the floor beneath him quiver and shake. The tea cup on his desk, filled with piping-hot liquid, began to vibrate intensely, and even his desk seemed to shift ever so slightly. As the window panes too began to rattle, Yazov felt his stomach tighten. He knew full well what kind of force it took to cause such a racket.\n\nThe Glavkoverkh's suspicions were confirmed by a loud thump that once again shook the entire room. Rushing from his desk to peer out the window, he was met with a large, distant plume of smoke rising against the evening sky. Omsk's vast industrial sector was in that same direction, and Yazov felt shock turn to anger as he began to connect the dots.\n\nWith an explosion of that size, this was obviously no accident. The insurgents were getting more bold with their attacks, and they clearly weren't afraid to strike the very heart of the League."
 omskbatov.14.a:0 "They have gone too far this time!"

 omskbatov.15.t:0 "Disappearing Act"
 omskbatov.15.d:0 "Lev Ivanov hated being so early to work. The old arms depot in Sverdlovsk tended to be rather unnerving without any of his co-workers around, with its claustrophobic concrete corridors and unreliable lighting. Lev couldn't help but feel as though someone or something was watching him as he made his way down to the storage unit to take stock.\n\nArriving at the door to the small arms storage, Lev immediately discovered that the double doors seemed to be stuck. He groaned and tried not to think about who might have jammed the door without even bothering to fix it. Placing all his weight against the door, Lev strained as he attempted to shove the door open.\n\nNo luck. Lev decided to change tactics, and, perhaps against his better judgement, started to ram his shoulder into the doors. Surprisingly, his first attempt worked, and Lev found himself barreling through the two doors and diving for the concrete floor. Dusting himself off, Lev stood up to examine the scene. There was a weak plank of wood that now laid in twain across the floor, which appeared to have been wedged under the handles of the doors. Behind him, however, was an even more confusing scene.\n\nThe armory was empty. Every crate, every weapon, every bullet was gone. In the far corner of the colossal room, he noticed the cargo bay doors were wide open. Although part of him was annoyed that he didn't think to use those to get in, Lev was far more concerned with what would happen when he reported this breach of security to the head of his cadre..."

 omskreg.1.d:0 "It was an unusually cold morning in Omsk. Frost had formed on the windows overnight, obscuring the view of the outside world. Yazov considered opening the window to scrape it off, then decided against it. He turned back to Pitovranov, only to find him still buried in the newest report on production numbers. Yazov had skimmed the report earlier and it seemed to contain mostly good news, though he had called Pitovranov to his office to confirm that. The economist, always a man of details, had been reading the report for almost an hour, leaving Yazov waiting for him to finish. In that time Yazov had made himself a cup of coffee, written a memo for commanders of the combat cadres, briefly contemplated cleaning his window, and made a list of captured partisans he wanted executed.\n\nPitovranov cleared his throat and put down the report, finally finished with it. Yazov turned to hear what he had to say.\n\n"Overall, this is very promising. Obviously there is some inefficiency from integrating the industry of reclaimed territories, but not as much as I'd anticipated. There are a few areas I'd like to tweak the production quotas, with your permission of course, but all signs say we are headed in the right direction."\n\nYazov grinned. "Permission granted." The economist nodded then turned to leave but before he could go Yazov called out to him. "Evgeny, before you leave can I ask you for complete honesty?"\n\nPitovranov didn't even attempt to hide the confusion on his face. "Of course, sir. What is it?"\n\n"Did you ever think we'd make it this far? The League I mean?"\n\n"I suppose I never really thought about it. I just kept doing my duty and this is where it has led me."\n\nYazov chuckled. "That makes sense. Recently I've been thinking about how far we've come. It seems like just yesterday we were fighting tooth and nail to hold on to Omsk, and now here we are, masters of western Siberia and soon all of Russia."\n\n"We could not have done it without your leadership sir."\n\n"Thank you Evgeny. I've done everything I can to save the motherland, and thankfully it seems that has been enough. Can I tell you something that won't leave this room?"\n\n"Of course.""

 omskreg.2.d:0 "Stepan gazed, for the fifth day in a row, in utter puzzlement at the uniformed men on patrol past his house. They wore camouflage and black helmets rather than the khaki and green of Marshal Batov's soldiers. There was something about their manner, too, which he found disconcerting. Batov's men had always chatted happily amongst themselves, stopped to talk with citizens or help them with minor tasks. These men appeared to regard Stepan and his neighbours as lesser people, not even looking their way unless it was to deliver a cold, cruel glare.\n\nOn the sixth day, he mustered his courage and stepped out into the street as the patrol approached. "Excuse me," he called out, "Excuse me!"\n\nThe sergeant at the head of the patrol signalled for them to stop, and he approached Stepan. "Yes, citizen? Something to report?"\n\nStepan shook his head nervously. "No, sir, I was just wondering... who are you men? You aren't under Marshal Batov's command, are you?"\n\nThe patrol collectively glared at the civilian, who suddenly felt as though he'd made a serious mistake. The sergeant's eyes narrowed. "Because of your... advanced age, I will forgive your ignorance, comrade. We are the Black League. We are Russia. The traitor marshal has been driven from this place, and you are under our rule now. Do not forget it. Patrol, march!"\n\nWith that, they were gone, polished boots hammering a tempo down the paved streets of Sverdlovsk.

The well-dressed man dropped to the pavement, dazed. "Shut up. It's not your property anymore. These," he said, motioning to the bottles of expensive alcohol filling the back of the truck, "Are class-A luxury goods, forbidden for civilian possession by directive of Glavkoverkh Yazov. As such, they are hereby forfeit."\n\nThe merchant scrambled to his feet and twitched like he was about to make a move, but then his arms dropped to his sides and his shoulders slumped. "But that's my living you're taking!" he whined. "If I can't make a profit off those, I'll be ruined."\n\n"Not my problem," Taras replied, crossing his arms. Behind him, his men lifted crate after crate of vodka out of the truck, chatting openly amongst themselves about 'skimming a little off the top' and 'how welcome the merchant's gifts were'. The merchant could only stand there impotently. Nobody passing by even glanced his way. When the last of the vodka was stowed away in the patrol's APC, Taras stepped back and allowed the merchant to shuffle back, empty-handed, to his truck.\n\n"Consider yourself lucky we aren't fining you, too," called Taras after him.

 omskreg.4.d:0 "The map of western Siberia was a complex mess of pins, scribbled notes, circles drawn in red ink and various stamps. The ISD had made great strides in the pacification of the area, but there remained one more major obstacle: Marshal Batov. His photograph was pinned to the corkboard in the ISD headquarters, generously perforated with pinholes. Beneath it were arrayed various photographs of other officers from Sverdlovsk; all were dead, their eyes crossed out - but not Batov.\n\n"He's got to be somewhere in the forests, surely," said one officer, tapping the circled woods north of Sverdlovsk. "It just makes sense, doesn't it?"\n\n"He'd get lost in there just as readily as anyone else," countered his junior. "No, sir, I believe him to be in Zlatoust, possibly in the area of the capital. Hiding in plain sight works more often than you'd think, and it would give him ready access to stolen weapons."\n\nWherever the treacherous marshal was hiding, he had to be found quickly.

Instead the League had been forced to grapple with rebellions and dissent. Rebuilding Russian society to be ready for the Great Trial had been time consuming, but necessary.

Then, in came the Glavkoverkh, as though he were a civilian wandering into a shop on a lazy Sunday.\n\n"As you were, comrades," said Yazov, his face an unreadable half-smile. Within a heartbeat, every man had resumed his previous activities, unquestioning of their leader's sudden laxity. Yazov began to stroll through the hall at a leisurely pace, looking left to right with the drill sergeant and two armed guards at his back. He paused before a group of men engaged in rapid, relentless push-ups.\n\n"How long have these men been going, sergeant?" he asked, his tone neutral.\n\n"My apologies, sir, but I've no idea. Corporal Rykov is leading them, though."\n\n"Corporal Rykov, at attention!" called Yazov. A giant of a man leapt to his feet and snapped to, stone-faced and straight-backed. "How many push-ups have you fellows performed today, Corporal?"\n\nDespite towering over Yazov, the man swallowed. "I'm not certain, sir. We measure ourselves in time rather than individual actions. Currently we stand at thirteen minutes straight."\n\nYazov tapped his chin. "Explain your reasoning for this, Corporal."\n\n"Sir! Because endurance is best measured in years, not footsteps, sir!"\n\nYazov nodded, content. "Very good, Corporal. You know our ethos well. Carry on.""

We are Russia!" they replied.\n\n"What is our purpose?"\n\n"To kill the German!"\n\n"How far will we go?"\n\n"Even to our dying breath!" came the roar. Loudest of all was Pavel, his voice bearing a harsh edge born of hate. Hate was what fuelled him, what gave him purpose. It had become him, transformed into a raging inferno when the foul German bandits of Orsk took his village and burned it to ash. For years he had wandered, living off the land, sustained by the Motherland's gifts. The day the Black League had found him scrounging for food amongst the dead was the day that had made him who he was today. The League had taken him in, honed the uncontrollable fire in his soul into a searing blade of vengeance. Someday, when the League took the fight to Germany, he would be unleashed. When a German boy had suffered as he had, seen his mother defiled, his siblings butchered like swine, his home reduced to cinders - only then would justice be done."

The earth would absorb the blows from even the strongest nuclear weapons, and those sheltered inside would survive, to emerge as avenging angels for the motherland.\n\nConstruction had already begun some time ago, and he could just barely make out the massive concrete and steel circular doorway that led deep into the mountain. All of Omsk had experienced being underground at one point or another, but no subterranean structure would truly compare to this operation.\n\nHe thought of what Karbyshev would say if he saw this, and what his little state had become. For some reason, it turned his stomach. A wriggling doubt in the back of his mind told him that something was off. He remembered the doubts he heard from Karbyshev just before his death, and his words about right and wrong. They left a sour taste in his mouth as he walked towards what was to be his wonder of the world. Surely, Karbyshev would agree that this was necessary. Surely, he was doing the right thing for Russia."

And Andrey intended, with every fibre of his being, to be ready.\n\nIn between his ordinary classes on language, mathematics, and the like, he received instruction on the principles of the league.\n\nIn the morning, he learned about the visionary foresight of General Karbyshev and his preparation for the first national programs of action. In the afternoon, he learned about how he could better shape himself to help, with ever increasing effectiveness, the purification, reclamation, and vengeance inherent to the other programs.\n\nEvery day - one more day closer to the Great Trial - he learned more, understood more, and became more prepared.\n\nHe had even begun applying his lessons outside of school, watching carefully for evidence of revisionism or insufficient dedication. He had already identified several such individuals, and though he could of course not be sure what happened after his reports, at least two had, so far, not been seen since. And deservedly so.\n\nAndrey intended to protect himself, his family, his people, and the Black League, and he would not be deterred from any course of action that would advance any of those goals.\n\nThat was what his teachers had taught him, and Andrey very much loved school."

Foreign affairs had initially deemed it to be too dangerous, especially considering that up until now Omsk and its surrounding territory has been an informational black hole. This, more than anything, is what led to CIA pressure to attend.\n\nA few CIA agents disguised as bodyguards attended the conference with the curious diplomats last week, and reported that the situation in Omsk appeared surprisingly... normal.\n\nThe government had clearly done hasty work to beautify the city center and refurbish an old hotel for diplomatic use, but such a thing was hardly out of the ordinary when American officials visited developing nations.\n\nTruthfully, most were impressed at how well the local government had patched over the cracks of war and decay, and found it to be an excellent sign of the government's effectiveness.\n\nThe only dissenting opinion of this rather pleasant assessment was from an older agent, who insisted there was something off about the people's smiles - something dead and rotten in their eyes.\n\nRegardless of his paranoia, the conference went rather well, with diplomats being well fed with local cuisine and well watered with vodka. They were even given the honour of meeting the ever busy Dmitry Yazov, who the diplomats found to be a very impressive figure. They assure us that, while he wasn't democratically elected, he seems to be a 'developmental authoritarian', using his unchecked executive power to turn a backwards region around for the better before transitioning to democracy. The West Siberian request was hardly unexpected, they merely wished for OFN recognition of their government as a sovereign state.\n\nWe hardly have any reason not to accept."

A CIA that believed us to be insignificant would report that we are no threat, and thus spend their resources elsewhere.\n\nWe politely ignored the overly curious 'bodyguards' whose performances couldn't hold a flame to the impenetrable wall of deceit we laid upon them.\n\nAnd yet, one of those damned agents didn't believe a word we said. Staring, scowling, and whispering to his fellows the entire conference.\n\nHe must have gotten through to someone, for not long after they returned to their gilded shithole of a country we received a call informing us that our request was denied and that we were not to contact their ministry again.\n\nA wave of finger pointing has engulfed the foreign ministry, and several officials who were in charge of the deception have been removed from their posts."

He loudly implied that once Russia is unified, they'd be inclined to offer some extremely lucrative mineral rights deals to the zaibatsus - in exchange for a few minor diplomatic concessions now.\n\nNews of this rapidly spread throughout the business world, and soon the diplomatic office was under significant pressure to accept the offer.\n\nThe conference was of little consequence. The little Russian men had clearly gone to great effort to renovate the city center for our diplomats, but were horrendously embarrassed when a wrong turn on the way from the airport led the mission on a detour through the dirty industrial district of the city. A business expert assigned to the diplomatic team reportedly grew insatiably excited after spotting the vast reserves of Siberian resources laid out in endless stockpiles.\n\nThe concessions requested by the West Siberians were mostly minimal, the largest demand being an official recognition of them as a legitimate and sovereign nation.\n\nWhile we have no guarantee that the West Siberians will actually come out on top of the Russian conflicts, it's a very small request compared to a potentially enormous economic gain."

Wishful thinking took them far enough to think we might actually go through with the insulting plan. This was enough to get their interest, and an 'accidental' detour of the delegation into an industrial stockpile of resources we'd trucked in from all over our territory had them so enchanted that they gave us everything we wanted.\n\nWith Japan now officially recognising us, we can trust that they, along with their wretched East Asian puppets, will stay neutral in our unification struggles."

His article, published in various outlets throughout America and the free world, has already made waves, as many nations are reconsidering their prior stances on us.\n\nThis may prove useful, especially considering the necessity of additional resources and contacts in these nations. While distasteful, it would prove useful in defeating both our enemies in Russia and in the eventual conclusion of the Great Trial."

They were merely words on a page. He would give the world more than an announcement. He would give them a declaration.\n\n"To all the heroes of Russia assembled here today..." He started off a bit shaky, his voice a little too monotonal over the microphone.\n\n"There have been many who have told us of our imminent failure. Many who have doubted the will and strength of a people long under assault. Many who fear what we might become. They know nothing of the sacrifices the Russian people have been forced to make in the name of survival. But we know, comrades. We know all too well what was lost in the First Trial, and we know now what must be done.\n\nHe began to speed up. His clenched hand wrapped around the podium, and he leaned forward.\n\n"Russia must be made strong again, and the Russian people with it. We must do this for our own survival, and we cannot expect help from abroad. But the inner strength of our nation, of the people themselves, is a bottomless resource, and it has been tested time, and time again. We must use that now to construct a new Russia from the ashes of the old, and do whatever is necessary to ensure that it survives forevermore.\n\n"At stake is everything you know, and the survival of every man, woman, and child in Russia. For if we were to fail, and let the German reconquer what he wills, or let the weaklings around us take power, the world will never again make the mistake of letting the Russian people reunite. But we will not fail. For that, I depend- Russia depends- on your courage and skill."\n\nHe relaxed as he wound down. His hand unclenched, he stood straight, and spoke softly.\n\n"Know that each of you pushes forward the day that we all see Russia freed from its chains. Long live the Reclamation Government, and the justice that it will bring!"\n\nWith one voice, the answer came:"

Whether he is Cincinnatus or Caesar, Yazov certainly now has the power of a military dictator, and appears to have cemented his rule.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this military state can last, whether Yazov can keep the reins steady.\n"

They had promised food, shelter, and community, which was two more things than any of the villagers had right now. But the little town near Samara was now part of the League, and that meant that the people in it were, too. A middle-aged man sat behind a desk as a mother and her child approached.\n\n"Only one at a time, please, ma'am."\n\n"Please, he is very young. I only wish to make sure-" The official raised his finger to cut her off.\n\n"That is for me to decide. He shall serve the League in whatever way Russia requires. What is his age?"\n\n"He is only 16. Surely there is some work he can do." She began to whisper. "Something away from the front lines."\n\nHe was not 16. The official was quite aware that he was not 16. And still, he paused for a few seconds. He recalled his own Youth Cadre, the punishments, the pain, as well as the brotherhood. This mother had no idea what being 16 in Omsk actually meant, what it required. His face grew blank as he accidentally stared at the boy. His pen hovered over the assignment card. "If he were not 16, I might be able to assign him to an industrial cadre rather than a Youth Cadre." The official looked very purposefully at the mother. "Do you understand me?"\n\nThe mother watched as his sunken face turned towards her. There was very little to indicate any change in expression, except that the corners of his lifeless eyes seemed to twitch, and there was a turn in his stubbled right cheek. "...Yes. He is 18."\n\n"I see. You are being assigned to Cadre 603481, in Luzino. Your son will be assigned to Cadre 704821, in Sverdlovsk. Do not pack anything. You will be transported tomorrow.

Sealed doorways, CBRN-resistant ventilation systems, room for nearly three hundred people in this underground home. He traced his finger down the elevator and along the hallway to the residential areas. He had been in enough bunkers to know what it would look like. He knew how the walls would feel rough and unwelcoming, how the air would start to become stale, how the silence would start to drive you mad after a few weeks. The engineer's voice snapped him out of his daydream.\n\n"Current estimates are that it could survive a five megaton warhead detonating at .22 km height at any distance farther than half a kilometer. Survivors would be able to continue operations without further supply for up to half a year, at which point potable water would be expended. Our estimated cost for each is a hundred thousand rubles, depending on terrain and features. Naturally, they can be outfitted with additional modules for command units, armories, and etcetera, to be designated at time of construction."\n\nAll so technical. So deterministic.

This was to be Russia's future. This had to be Russia's future. For a second, he allowed himself to feel safe and ready. Nothing could touch them here. The network of these bunkers that had been built would secure the Russian people against any eventuality. These small rooms, barely large enough for three stacked cots and shelves, were a great accomplishment of the program of national action: survival of the Russian nation, whatever the cost. He had always spoken about it in words, and always believed it, but the bunkers were his words made manifest.\n\nThe lights flickered off for a moment. When they came back on, Yazov had already started back up the stairs towards the elevator. There was still so much to be done. Tons of concrete and snaking tunnels do not prepare a nation for war. He didn't even know if the bunkers would work, yet he had claimed to all assembled that their security was guaranteed forevermore. He climbed faster. What a joke he had played on all of them, and on himself, in thinking that he could stop the inevitable. He was nothing, just the shadow of Karbyshev, a pretender playing the savior for all to see.\n\nHe arrived at the elevator, adjusted his cap, and pushed the button.

I have invited some gentlemen from Hollywood that have expressed interest in this endeavor and have written a brief script that reflects the ideas we would like to see put onto the big screen.\n\n"To put it simply, Ambassador, we want to show that our objective is neither some vengeful crusade, nor to establish some brutal dictatorship-quite the opposite! What we want is what any nation wishes for- peace and security for its citizens.

"The work being done to improve living conditions everywhere in Siberia, your industrial innovations, your use of natural resources- I am greatly impressed by what I have seen here. I believe history will record you as a great builder for the benefit of mankind," he replied.\n\nWith a final handshake, and the ambassador turning back for a final salute as he walked out the door, the famous movie, "Mission to Omsk", portraying the purported reality of life in newly unified West Siberia, faded to black. Reviews have been highly polarized, with some saying that it is merely a propagandistic hack job, while others credit innovative screenplay design and the use of helicopters to capture scenes of expansive Russia as never seen before.

Whether there was a rat in the town or whether his transmissions had been intercepted was irrelevant at this point. What mattered was that he was screwed.\n\nIt was there, in the muck, that he decided that he would die here. He knew what the Germans would do to him if they captured him- the manuals he had been given told one story, but his comrades in the unit told of far worse fates that awaited him. But he would choose to die on his own soil, his nation's soil. And one day, there would be tanks running through this swamp, throwing these arrogant Germans off the ground that he would make sacred.\n\nHe looked at the small pill he had been given in case of emergencies.

While conventional military action will be needed to dismantle the German state, it will also be necessary to use unconventional means to assist this main objective. With that in mind, specialized units will be deployed into the heart of Germany well before military operations commence in order to sabotage infrastructure, cause civilian casualties, and destroy the trust of the government in its military.\n\nProbing attacks must first be conducted in vulnerable areas on insignificant targets- namely, isolated civilians and low-ranking officials. Utilizing information gained here on German reactions, we can target our larger-scale operations towards infrastructure and transport systems. Critical to these attacks will be the usage of German chemical weapons- this will result in suspicion being directed towards the Wehrmacht. We can then escalate attacks towards the population, resulting in the desired split between the civilian and military leadership. Research into replicating these agents is, therefore, of a high priority.\n\nWith the civilian government fearing a coup from within and the military attempting to maintain order, we expect that we will be able to trigger a partial shutdown of the strategic command structure within the timespan of one to two months after major operations begin. This will severely hamper any conventional or nuclear response to our initial attacks. You may find an extended timeline on pages twenty-five through twenty-eight, and a requested budget on pages thirty-three through thirty-nine.""

His team had been slowly breeding the virus to be resistant to almost every antibiotic available in Russia. Upon mentioning this fact, Ovchinnikov had turned to Yazov and, like a schoolboy telling a prurient joke to a friend, had suggested with a smirk that the medical aid being sought abroad by the Glavkoverkh might come in handy for this. Then, he directed Yazov's attention to a darkened room at the end of the hall, turning on the light to reveal a nearly skeletal man, hunched over an exercise bike of some kind. This man, as the major explained, was being used to test the efficacy of pathogens on soldiers in combat.

He relived the moment for the thousandth time, repeating what that damn miner had asked him. How he had angrily demanded clarification as his entourage looked on in horror. How the miner had continued, saying some relative of his was on duty that night and had seen it happen, his comrades agreeing. The men were dead now, but he couldn't kill their words, words eating away at his mind like a corrosive poison. He had to know.\nAnother day. Karbyshev's old Tatar aide, caught in Tyumen, regarding the Glavkoverkh with pity even as he languished in his manacles. Yazov remembered how he had stood up, ramrod-straight, staring down at the prostrate yet defiant man from mere feet away. And how that man had nonchalantly told him how it was all true. He wanted to go out on his own terms, the Tatar had said. He decided to embrace the inevitable. He had taken control, the Tatar had added, mocking Yazov. Again, the man was now gone. But, even without their vessel, the accursed words still fluttered about, haunting him. Confidence was now draining away, being replaced by a growing shame that he was letting this hound him at all. The Great Trial awaited, he told himself. He had greater things to deal with, a greater mark to leave on history. The inevitable-\nYazov's mind crystallized into absolute clarity. The conclusion was simple, the logic plain. Just as Karbyshev had seen the inevitability of death, and thus embraced it on his own terms, so should Russia not simply wait for the Great Trial, but start it when she was ready. He saw his path forward, his decisive mark in history. The warm winds of destiny were at his back, overriding his own doubts, as he looked up to the plaque on the wall bearing the three Karbyshevite theses. Now, there would be a fourth."

Dressed in hazmat suits and gas masks, their breathing seemed to echo in the walls of this place. It was dark, with only their electric lights piercing the gloom. They looked at the walls, the moss that had grown over the concrete, like greenish plaque on an infected tooth. A transparent film formed over it, a liquid that seeped through years of non-maintenance. Drip, drip, drip. The ceilings seemed to perspire in fear of what it had contained.\n\n"Alek," Valery said, "I get the feeling that this place ain't friendly." Friendly, frien, frie, fri. His voice echoed within the vast chambers of the Mountain's research complex. "Did you hear that?"\n\n"I did." Alek seemed more amazed than afraid of this place, although Valery saw his left arm tremble. The fingers that held the flashlight were a little unsteady. "I've heard stories. My family lived in Sverdlovsk. People who go here," Alek said, his flashlight drifting towards the ceiling, "do not come back. Either researcher or subject."\n\n"That infamous, huh."\n\n"You're from Zlatoust. You wouldn't know."\n\n"I guess." They walked inside, the concrete crunching under the heels of their boots.

There was no shortage of enemies he'd faced, no shortage of bitter reprisals and post-hoc justifications, and yet here he was, facing the men the Internal Security (Naval) Branch despised most of all: the men and occasional women of the sea. Nikolayevich, their head, had been running the ports for as long as the Black League's long halls held memory of him, and his motley little crew were whispered to have fingers in every pie this side of the Arctic Sea. Including, it was whispered, the Germans' own fleets.\n\n"Gentlemen, please. Sit down." There had been a time when Aleksey, fresh from League boot-camp, would have gladly paid his own life to strangle this enemy of the State, but he'd grown in his long watch to understand the higher truths. There was an order to killing. A reason. And he now had a reason to keep this man alive.\n\n"Commissar Alexey." Nikolayevich raised a grey-flecked eyebrow. "What is the purpose of this visit?"\n\nTargets and people, Alexey reminded himself. "Nikolayevich. I have been ordered to bring you in, but the Black League seeks not to arrest you. Your talents are... required." He gestured at the photos in the open file before them both. "We seek reconnaissance. Submarine and marine both. Your clippers are seaworthy, and armed. We will bring them into the fold, and we will build your ships for you. You need only say yes." As Nikolayevich rose to speak, Alexey held a hand up. "And before you negotiate, you might want to take a look at the last picture."\n\nNikolayevich flipped to the end of the dossier. His eyes turned cold. His face went white. A wordless murmur escaped his lips, and Alexey rose from his seat. "We offer much - but never forget what we can take, Nikolayevich. Report to the Naval Yard at 0900 hours tomorrow.""

 omsksr.27.d:0 "The sky was without form, and darkness was on the face of the clouds. And as the access door leading onto the command center's rooftop slammed shut, Yazov was once again alone. Adrenaline sublimated into the mist, his body cooled by the soft drizzle. The tramp of boots echoed off Omsk's concrete carapace as a cadre drilled on the square below.\n\nSakharovsky. Savintsev. Steklyar. Six others, chosen by name. They were the first to hear about the Thesis. Sworn to secrecy beyond any known in the League. Miles of barbed wire and layers within layers of security clearances had still come to this: a meeting on the rooftop, five stories in the air, where only the wind and sky could eavesdrop.\n\nOnly hours ago, Yazov had felt sick to his stomach. What if this was all insanity? And even then, until that moment of truth, the Thesis' existence was dizzyingly tenuous - only a single heartbeat away from erasure. But now, the truth would be borne by ten men. And then, a hundred. And one day, by all Russians.\n\nYet, a new, even more sickening, dread overtook Yazov. He could feel the great colossus groaning beneath his feet, awakened from its slumber. He could see the leviathan stirring behind the sky's gray sheets of rain. The wheels were now turning, gears tearing at decades of grime and rot and decay. Now, perhaps he could stop what he started, before millions rallied to the call. But soon, it would be beyond the control of any man. It would grow and grow until a nation's wrath blotted out the sun. The thought was exhilarating but terrifying. What was he, a mere man, against such a will, such a great machine? In the most primal depths of his gut, he feared it would swallow him whole. And so, as a bone-chilling rain ran from the languid skies, the master of Russia turned around, opened the door, and resigned himself to a fate unknown."

But fate was incontrovertible, inevitable, and they fared no better than children trying desperately to squirm their way out of a doctor's shot. Such men left their earthly lives in struggle, shouting that the Black League men were all murderous, satanic Jews and Bolsheviks who would destroy Holy Russia. That the Vozhd still lived, and that even now Blackshirts were regrouping, and would soon take back Zeya. In their last moments, as they looked cold death in the eyes, they tried to rally the people who had once cheered the deaths of the RFP's enemies.\n\nOthers went into the cold night in a far more pathetic manner, begging for their lives and shrilly pleading their innocence. That they hadn't known about Rodzaevsky's crimes, or if they had known, there was nothing that they could do, or if they could have done something they were ordered not to. But it was all for naught - the die were already cast.\n\nAnd then some met fate quietly, without so much as a word. Perhaps they were resigned to their fate. Or perhaps they knew their guilt, and knew that this was justice.\n\nFor days on end, Zeya's central square was filled with nonstop executions of Russia's fascists - generals, ideologues, party bureaucrats, and even the Vozhd's pet "Patriarch" - held on the very same gallows where Matkovsky and the pretender-Tsar had met their respective ends. The hangman's lot was not an easy one. But, for once, the liquidation cadre manning the gallows did not feel a single pang of remorse."

The world was silent, save the soft sounds of distant police sirens and the occasional passing BTR.\n\nWhen Marat saw the man crouched at the basis of the West Russian War Memorial in the center of the city twenty minutes after the end of curfew, he had assumed the worst. A possible saboteur, maybe someone planting a bomb. He'd seen many of those in the days since the fall of Arkhangelsk. But as he stepped out of the staff car into the damp, drizzly night, his pistol at the ready, his concern faded away. The man at the base of the memorial was clearly quite elderly. Marat's steps slowed, and it was only in a regular speaking voice that he addressed the man.\n\n"Sir, you should really get going. It's twenty minutes past curfew." The man turned around, slowly, revealing a ragged jacket adorned with Soviet decorations and a crumpled St. George Ribbon. A look of subtle disdain crossed the old man's time-weathered face as he regarded the young man. Marat instantly knew what he was thinking - it was the same with almost everyone he'd met in Arkhangelsk. Were these men in black any different from the ones who had come before?\n\nMarat broke the silence with an outstretched hand and a gesture back to the staff car."

She couldn't go down to the Bryudershaftsplats, because there wasn't a Bryudershaftsplats anymore. Now, they called it the Ploshad' Osvobozhdeniya, and her parents scolded her harshly, with fear in their eyes, for calling it by the other name. The old "Permhaym," rough and substantial, was now just a single, clipped syllable - "Perm'." The new way of naming things, frankly, just seemed so clunky compared to how they used to do things. "Gitleralleyy," short and simple, was now "Prospekt Sakharovskogo."\n\nEven her friends had been changed by this strange event. Greta, the girl she had grown up playing with, was now "Galina." Teodor, now "Fyodor." Ulrikh, now "Yuri." And she hadn't seen Adolf in weeks.\n\nNowadays, she had to talk differently as well. In school, the teacher would smack her with a ruler if she heard her talking in the old way, with its hard sounds and soft accent. The new way was different and confusing, with strange words and a persistent sound she couldn't quite master.\n\nIn time, the old tongue would fade, eroded away by time's steady tide.

Some of the city's denizens clearly wished to show their loyalty to the new regime, waving homemade banners and chanting recently-learned slogans. Yet the motives of others were not as easily discerned - certainly, no one dared to publicly show sympathy for the traitors of the ROA. Perhaps it was simply the crude spectacle of it all, then. Or for some, maybe it was the chance to see a long chapter in Samara's history come to a definitive end, on a simple wooden gallows at the square's center.\n\n"SERGEY KUZMICH BUNYACHENKO!" The hangman's assistant shouted the name of his first customer in a booming, officious voice, as if he were the gatekeeper to Valhalla. The general, wearing a bare gray jacket stripped of all insignia, stepped forward, climbing the steps onto the gallows with an air of solemn acceptance. Although he was surprised by the fact that he was not granted last words as the noose was slipped around his neck, he didn't seem especially bothered, and went silently to his death, stolid and emotionless.\n\n"MILETIY ALEXANDROVICH ZYKOV!" The unassuming ideologue stepped forward, his mind vacant, worn raw by weeks of pleading and reasoning with the unreasonable. He seemed almost half-asleep as the noose was put over his neck, muttering something that only he and the hangman would ever hear.\n\n"MIKHAIL ALEXSANDROVICH ILINICH!" The profiteer-general stepped forward with an almost-lewd smirk. Something resembling a cheer rippled through some of the locals assembled on the plaza. As the noose was slipped around his neck, he tried his best to flash a defiant grin, but it quickly turned to a grimace as the finality of it all dawned on him.
