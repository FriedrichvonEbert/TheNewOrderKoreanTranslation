 gul_reign_of_the_oil_king:0 "Reign Of The Oil King"
 gul_reign_of_the_oil_king_desc:0 "Enrico Mattei has made a fortune from the Italian Empire's colonial resources. It seems only fitting therefore, that the Governorate of one of the most resource rich regions of the Empire, the Persian Gulf, should fall to his capable management. The big men in Rome have high hopes for their business prodigy, and he has never once failed their expectations before.\n\nMattei may be a capitalist suit, but none would argue that he is a miser or a man to misuse his authority. The Chairman of ENI has always maintained a personal policy of morality in his dealings, and although he may often do business with partners whose honor is questionable, he has shown a clear sincerity in his desire to thrive alongside, not over, those he is responsible for.\n\nMattei has used his seemingly Midas-touched hands to develop the ENI into a global giant, and now that the offices of Chairman and Governor are under his cool and calculating authority, there is little doubt that his tenure as Governor will be long and prosperous."
 
 gul_review_the_dubai_project:0 "Review The Dubai Project"
 gul_review_the_dubai_project_desc:0 "Governor Mattei has some big plans for his new Governorate, and for Dubai in particular. Settled comfortably along the natural path of ships heading out of the Mediterranean and through the Persian Gulf to more exotic ports, Dubai could well become the greatest trade hub in the Italian Empire if supported properly.\n\nA "Marketplace of the Middle East" is what Mattei envisions, and what a marketplace he has planned out indeed. Towers that brush the sky for the companies and moguls, hotels and mansions for the tourists, dockyards as far as the eye can see, roads for goods to be directed across the colonies, all will be built for the Governor's vision to take form."
 
 gul_ENI_investments:0 "ENI Investments"
 gul_ENI_investments_desc:0 "The main business interests that the Governor will have to deal with in the stretching sands and sprawling cities of his new post are those of ENI, the Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, now at the top of the oil and gas markets thanks to Italian control of the oil drenched Middle East. While he is the Governor, Mattei is also the Chairman of ENI, and some wonder which of the two titles he will prioritize. Mattei himself seems to feel confident in his ability to juggle the responsibilities while also arguing that his status as Chairman will give him greater freedom in fulfilling his goals as Governor. What is certain is that the Governorate is about to have much more in the way of funding, albeit private. A hybrid business empire and governmental administration isn't unheard of, but other attempts have had... less than successful results. Mattei remains convinced however, that his approach will be proven correct, and with his success record, perhaps he is right."
 
 gul_involve_the_emirs:0 "Involve The Emirs"
 gul_involve_the_emirs_desc:0 "The seven emirates that form the local management of the Governorate: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ajman, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al Quwain, not to mention the emirs of Kuwait and Qatar, will all need to be convinced of the benefits of cooperating fully with the Governorate. While relying on Italian support will be important, building a strong working relationship with the local officials will be highly beneficial in the long term development of the colony. Besides, if Mattei found himself in a position where following Italy's lead could prove... inadvisable, local allies would be indispensable.\n\nMattei has begun scheduling meetings with the Emirs where he will provide them with proof of the sincerity of Italy's plans to support the Gulf Region. Failing that, Mattei has also made provisions for large sums of money to be transferred to certain offshore accounts. Whatever the Emirs might require to guarantee their support, Mattei will provide."
 
 gul_ENEL_electrification_plans:0 "ENL Electrification Plans"
 gul_ENEL_electrification_plans_desc:0 "A key part of Mattei's program to turn the Gulf into, as the Governor puts it, "The Jewel in King Umberto's Crown", is the electrification of the colony. While the major cities may have a high level of electrical coverage, the distribution is far from uniform across the region. To keep such a blemish from marring the record of his would-be otherwise perfect plans for developing the Governorate, Mattei will use his extensive government and private sector contacts to secure contracts with the premier Italian energy group, Enel.\n\nThe Governor will personally take charge in the negotiations to craft a program that will not only bring the people of the Gulf into the prosperity of the Empire but also maximize the use of resources expended. The Governor is betting on his skills as a businessman to further his goals as an administrator."
 GUL_electrification_plans:0 "Dubai Electrified"
 
 gul_al_yawm:0 "Al-Yawm"
 gul_al_yawm_desc:0 "The media has many uses for a man like Governor Mattei. While others in the Italian government might see the media as little more than something to be used to tow a party line, Mattei has seen a vehicle for business and information. The ENI has an Arabic language newspaper under its media wing, Al-Yawm, The Day, that may be just what the Governor is looking for.\n\nA more local publication, that speaks the language of the native people will be much more equipped to bring the people to the Italians' side than any government bulletin from on high could hope to be. Experts have also suggested that investing more heavily into Al-Yawm could further increase efficiency in communication regarding the programs currently being implemented, and if there is one thing Mattei likes to see, it's efficiency. "
 
 gul_expand_the_dock_yards:0 "Expand The Dock Yards"
 gul_expand_the_dock_yards_desc:0 "From a memo found on the Governor's desk:\n\n...Development of new dock facilities should take precedence over all other construction projects currently underway save for administration building and projects that the Governor has given priority to. These dockyards must be able to construct more lines in parallel and handle larger hull types than previous designs. For further details on specifications, see Attachment A. Land appropriation forms must be satisfactorily completed and compensation must be given if appropriate. As these dockyards will cement our place as a bastion for the Regia Marina and private contractors, the importance of this project cannot be understated. Working with native construction groups is advised if practicable, see Attachment D for dealing with non-Government contractors... "
 
 gul_Nuovo_Pignone:0 "Nuovo Pignone"
 gul_Nuovo_Pignone_desc:0 "It is time to establish the company's supply lines in the Gulf. The main producer of ENI's machinery and equipment is Nuovo Pignone. They make the pumps we use, the compressors, the turbines, a hundred other small pieces that are essential for the art of oil extraction. Luckily for us, they are the best of the best, they are Italian.\n\nStill, quality or not, our growing presence in the Gulf has created a very real problem regarding our sister company. The arrival of new machinery is simply taking too long per delivery for Mattei's ambitious plans. This could be remedied quite easily though, it would only take one visit to the Nuovo Pignone head offices by the Governor of the Gulf, the Oil-King himself, to convince them to set up local factories in Dubai. Once they see how profitable business in the Gulf can be, they will never want to leave!"
 
 gul_new_technical_schools:0 "New Technical Schools"
 gul_new_technical_schools_desc:0 "We have many capable engineers and specialists employed by the company, but we must look to raising the next generation of Italian and Arab professionals. The Governor has set aside as sizable dispensation for the funding of several new technical schools throughout the Governorate. Further, in his role as Chairman of ENI, Mattei has promised private funds will be donated to this project, ENI is always interested in promoting the public good after all.\n\nNeedless to say, these schools will act as pipelines for ENI exclusively, but that goes without saying. Mattei is dedicating both civil and private funds for this endeavor; this is not some act of charity, it is an investment in the future of ENI's competency, and investment promises to bear great fruit further down the line."
 
 gul_immigration_from_india:0 "Immigration From India"
 gul_immigration_from_india_desc:0 "Employment at ENI facilities in the Gulf has certainly not been a pressing issue so far, there are plenty of Italians and native Arabs willing to reap the benefits of employment that only ENI can provide.\n\nThat being said, why stop when we are ahead? Mattei did not become Chairman of ENI, nor Governor of the Gulf, by resting on his laurels. Positions are filled? Good. Create more positions. India, that land of inexhaustible population, now there could be an untapped goldmine for labor. The Governor has never been one to rest on his laurels. We should begin an immigration promotion drive right away, those who step up to our call will not have cause to regret their decision. As the Governor is fond of saying, the Empire is like a family, and a family looks out for all of its members, that is the Italian way. Our friends from India will be welcomed as if they had come from Naples, Rome, or Dubai."
 
 gul_a_new_home_for_the_ENI:0 "A New Home For The ENI"
 gul_a_new_home_for_the_ENI_desc:0 "With the development of significant infrastructure across the Governorate matched with his desire to present the Gulf Governorate as an international home for business and commerce, Governor Mattei has, in his capacity as Chairman of ENI, has begun preparations for moving a large part of the group's resources and management offices to Dubai and several other prominent cities within the Governorate. Such a move would certainly cause other major companies to see the Gulf cities as legitimate places of business, and the direction of operations would also benefit from the shorter communication distance. Mattei believes the move to be an obvious one. After all, if the beating heart of ENI is in the emirates, should not the nervous system follow suit?"
 
 gul_the_heaviest_industries:0 "The Heaviest Industries"
 gul_the_heaviest_industries_desc:0 "It is time to make the Governorate fully self-sufficient. We have established the survey stations, we have constructed the manufacturers, built the company barracks, erected the company offices and brought in the workers by the boatful, but for all of that effort we still rely on Mother Italia for a large percentage of our needed machinery and tools.\n\nFoundries will be set up that will enable all machinery and parts required for ENI operations to be produced within the Governorate. Let the ringing of metal sound across the breadth our domain! Let the hiss of cooling iron be heard in every city! Let the clinking and clanking of gears echo far beyond the factory floor! It is time to make the Governorate come to life."
 
 gul_an_arab_middle_class:0 "An Arabic Middle Class"
 gul_an_arab_middle_class_desc:0 "The prosperity that ENI and the Italian Governorate have brought into the region has started to show real results. The average income of native Arabs has nearly doubled, and studies are showing that the general quality of life is also on the rise. It is the birth of a new concept in the Gulf: an Arab middle class. The Governor says we should view this as a sign of the wisdom of our policies thus far.\n\nWith more and more Arabs having disposable incomes, it may be time to begin investing in more entertainment and similar luxury services. They have this new windfall thanks to the benevolence of ENI and the Empire after all. Is it too much to ask that they put some of that surplus back into those who have helped them in so many ways?"
 
 gul_democratic_reforms:0 "Democratic Reforms"
 gul_democratic_reforms_desc:0 "From the front page of Al-Yawm:\n\n"The eyes of the world were on a small town in the Abu Dhabi emirate today as the Governorate of the Gulf took its first, shaky step on the path to democratic home rule. Governor Mattei officially signed into law a measure that allows for local elections of mayors, aldermans, sheriffs, and other minor offices for any Italian citizen in the Gulf, whether European, Arab, or Indian. In the small water bounded town of Masdar, Ahmed Asfour won in an overwhelming landslide thanks to Arab and Indian support. It has also been reported, although not confirmed, that Asfour had the support of the local CASL branch..."
 
 gul_expand_the_tanker_fleet:0 "Expand The Tanker Fleet"
 gul_expand_the_tanker_fleet_desc:0 "ENI is thriving in the Governorate, but why stop at mere success, why not push even further? We ought to expand our international tanker fleet as soon as possible. The more tankers we have, the more oil we ship, the more profit we will turn. Oil transport is our business after all, and the Chairman expects that business will be booming.\n\nThe Regia Marina will likely be our main source for additional tankers, although most of them will likely have been commissioned from Italian companies rather than being developed by the navy itself. That being said, there is nothing stopping us from expanding our search for foreign vessels or perhaps even whole designs that could be advantageous to possess. The Governor's insistence on dockyard production will now pay itself back in full."
 
 gul_confederazione_araba_sindacati_lavoratori:0 "Confederazione Araba Sindacati Lavoratori"
 gul_confederazione_araba_sindacati_lavoratori_desc:0 "Let it not be said that those who give up their time and sweat for the prosperity of the Empire go unrewarded. Without the hard work of native Arabs, no profit could be turned at all. We shall not be like the German slave masters, when a man proves valuable to ENI he shall be justly compensated, Mattei is adamant on this point.\n\nThe Chairman has given permission for a company affiliated union group, the CASL, to be established to provide representation for the native workers. Union members will be able to find camaraderie with their fellows, settle any disagreements with the company to the satisfaction of both parties, and model a successful employee-employer relationship to the world. The Chairman fully expects to increase both morale and productivity at once with such an inspired move."
 GUL_CASL:0 "Confederazione Araba Sindacati Lavoratori"
 
 gul_ENI_air_fleet:0 "ENI Air Fleet"
 gul_ENI_air_fleet_desc:0 "A company the size of ENI and the responsibilities to match will naturally require a dedicated air service of its own. Planes are the transportation method of the future, and Chairman Mattei is a man who always bets on the future. Investing in this method now will give ENI a global edge.\n\nComing up with new models of survey planes should also be prioritized, several prominent Italian aircraft designers, including Cessna and Fiat, have already offered proposals to Mattei personally. These companies would be sure to provide their designs for reasonable prices, especially if they were offered a "closer" relationship with ENI going forward.\n\nThese deals would of course need to be done in the usual opulent comforts of the elite class. Perhaps Mattei should ask those companies if they would also be willing to sell any private transport models to ENI, as deals are best done in comfort after all."
 
 gul_raise_the_gulf_scouts:0 "Raise The Gulf Scouts"
 gul_raise_the_gulf_scouts_desc:0 "While the ENI and the Empire have provided adequate security and military forces for the Governorate up until now, Mattei is actively looking at ways to involve the locals in their own defense and policing. In the long-term, the Governor knows that involving natives in positions of colonial authority will likely produce better results than relying solely on resented and often culturally ignorant European soldiers.\n\nThese Gulf Scouts, as Mattei has called them in his proposals, will be better acquainted with the terrain and better able to solve local issues than any foreigner could be. For their service, these volunteers will be well-compensated, Mattei has read his history, he will not repeat the mistakes of the EIC's Sepoy policies."
 
 gul_expand_the_health_care_service:0 "Expand The Health Care Service"
 gul_expand_the_health_care_service_desc:0 "From an article in Al-Yawm:\n\n"With ENI profits having increased dramatically, Governor Mattei has approved a proposal from the CASL to expand healthcare services significantly for ENI employees, including Arabs and Indians. Further, and in a move that caught some in Rome by surprise, Mattei included in the order provisions that would expand healthcare coverage to both the families of employees and former employees in the Gulf. While some critics have blasted the measure as a massive waste of resources, Mattei has maintained that the move is both morally justified as well as financially viable given the increase in revenue from ENI and other companies active in the region. Still, experts have warned that Mattei's critics are not likely to give up, and given the fact that many are members of the central Italian government in Rome, Mattei may have put his career at threat of crashing."
 
 gul_we_can_get_rich_together:0 "We Can Get Rich Together"
 gul_we_can_get_rich_together_desc:0 "Governor Mattei strode with a quiet grace that belied the dominating nature of his powerful titles. At times like this, when he enjoyed an evening constitutional within one of the lovely Dubai parks, recently developed as part of his pet project, Enrico Mattei could forget that he was the Chairman of ENI and forget that he was the Governor of a colony of people who depended on his actions. Or at least he had intended to.\n\nAlong the path of the park's trail sat a beggar in tattered clothes. Mattei walked over to the poor vagabond and asked him for his story, tossing a lira into the beggar's tin. The man explained that due to the monopoly of Italian companies in the Gulf, his shop had been forced out of business by one that was ENI affiliated. Mattei felt a pang of guilt for the man, his actions had caused this. He couldn't change the past, but no one else would have to suffer in the name of Italian interests if he could help it."
 
 gul_encourage_consumerism:0 "Encourage Consumerism"
 gul_encourage_consumerism_desc:0 "Money makes the world go 'round as even a fool would know, and Governor Mattei is no fool. An economy can only function smoothly if all actors are fully engaged. We have the businesses, the providers of goods and services. We have the government, the levier of taxes and bringer of subsidies. Do we have the people? Therein lies the concern. Everything that Mattei has built could collapse if no one is buying anything. The solution is promotion, promotion, promotion. People need to see how these products will improve their lives, they need to know how happy they will be if they buy just one more. Of course, this approach could lead to abuse from liars, but Mattei wouldn't let it get that far..."

 gul_ENI_cities:0 "ENI Cities"
 gul_ENI_cities_desc:0 "The increase in ENI activity in the Gulf directly has lead to a natural need for dedicated housing for the thousands of employees currently in the region. Of course, any sizable population center will require restaurants, theaters, club halls, shops, and bars, lots of bars as it turns out. Mattei has searched for examples from history and has several clear models to pick from, in particular, he has examined the coal towns in the 20th Century US.\n\nSo decided, so begun. The power of ENI is practically limitless here. Towns will be raised out of the sandy dunes as if by magic, roads laid overnight. The company man will leave his company house in the morning, work in his company post during the day, and enjoy his evening at the company bar. All will see that ENI provides for its people."
 
 gul_allow_independent_trade_unions:0 "Allow Indepedent Trade Unions"
 gul_allow_independent_trade_unions_desc:0 "The CASL was established as a company affiliated union for good reason; many in ENI feared that giving the workers, especially the native Arab laborers, too much leeway would lead to a case of "giving an inch and being taken for a mile". Mattei understood such concerns, he had even agreed to accept the demands of forbidding independent union groups... though what he had not voiced was his resolve that this would not be a permanent system. The opportunity has come for the restrictions to be lifted. The workers were always deserving of unions to the Chairman, but with the latest numbers coming in from Rome showing ENI profits through the roof, no one can openly challenge him without appearing like some rapacious German slavemaster. Just as as Mattei foresaw. All workers within the Gulf, directly working for ENI or not, will be allowed to unionize as they wish, so long as they keep their activities peaceful and within reason of course."
 
 gul_reinforce_ENI_control:0 "Reinforce ENI Control"
 gul_reinforce_ENI_control_desc:0 "Leaving more minute aspects of governing in the Gulf to local leaders and company proxies was a wise choice by Mattei to promote cooperation and a working relationship between our people and the natives. That being said, it will no longer suffice for the bringing about of the Governor's new vision.\n\nIn a secret memo to high level ENI executives, Governorate administrators, and Gulf military officers, Mattei outlined his plan to further merge the workings of the company and the colony together to ensure maximum efficiency. The Emirs would have to be subdued, dissent nipped in the bud, the people reassured, and the armed forces reviewed. A tall order, but Mattei will not settle for half-measures at such a critical juncture."

 gul_skyscraper_projects:0 "Skyscraper Projects"
 gul_skyscraper_projects_desc:0 "The skyscraper is the ultimate symbol of modern urban opulence and growth. It is a spire to the heavens signaling the power of man over nature, the power of capitalism to create marvels. Several skyscrapers have already been built in the Gulf's cities, mostly in Dubai, and more are currently under construction. To Mattei, every new tower erected represents a step closer to his dream of ushering in a golden age of prosperity for the company, the people, and the land he has been charged with watching overseeing. In his office in the Governor's mansion that overlooks the construction of a new and beautiful Abu Dhabi skyline, Mattei pulls a small and well-worn book of poetry from his bookshelf. Quickly turning to a page he has read more times than he can count, the Governor whispers so that only he can hear the words that his vision of the future, "I am great Ozymandias, The King of Kings; this mighty City shows the wonders of my hand.""
 
 gul_set_up_higher_education:0 "Set Up Higher Education"
 gul_set_up_higher_education_desc:0 "Of the many gifts we have bestowed upon our cherished Gulf subjects, none shall be more important to their future prosperity than our investment in universities for the Governorate's best and brightest. Several prominent Italian schools, including the famed Università degli Studi di Firenze, have established branch colleges in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to generous private donations from ENI and even from Chairman Mattei himself, several local institutes have begun to spring up in not just the Emirates, but also Qatar and Bahrain. Mattei has promised to attend the official opening ceremonies for several of these universities as a display of his dedication to the cause of education for all of the Empire's citizens."
 
 gul_the_council_of_emirs:0 "The Council Of Emirs"
 gul_the_council_of_emirs_desc:0 "All good things come to an end, as a businessman, Mattei is keenly aware of this fact. That is why he was not caught off guard by an announcement from the Governorate's emirs proposing a decolonization plan that would establish a "United Emirates". Despite the name, the emirs have also opened discussions with the Sheiks of Bahrain and Kuwait with the object of convincing all Arab leaders in the Gulf to come out in factor of the proposal.\n\nWhile some might see disaster, and some have, as is the nature of things, Mattei sees opportunity. Empires cannot last forever, but partnerships based on mutual understanding, friendship, and profit can last indefinitely. Of course, to create such a situation where an independent Gulf would remain a trusted partner of Italy, Mattei will need to work quickly to show his goodwill, and to remove any obstacles to painless transition."

 gul_police_the_emirs_desc:0 "The Emirs have proven that they cannot be trusted with the light handling that the Governor so graciously allowed up until this point. This mistake shall be corrected right away; the Emirs will be reigned in once and for all. ENI's work here is too damn valuable to the Empire to be derailed by the misbehavior of those whose days have passed.\n\nOur campaign to put these troublesome princes in their places will be quick and efficient. The ones we judge to be pliable will merely be put into a mild form of house arrest, just because they seem docile doesn't mean we won't prevent anything from happening behind our backs. Those Emirs deemed to be active agitators against our policies will be stripped of all authority, they will be denounced in the press and if they so much as sneeze, our intelligence apparatus will make sure we know. It didn't have to be this way, but they gave us no choice."
 
 gul_quell_unrest_in_buhrain:0 "Quell Unrest In Buhrain"
 gul_quell_unrest_in_buhrain_desc:0 "The island of Bahrain has become a thorn in our side as of late. It seems that those who disagree with out new... management style, as it were, have begun to coalesce there. This is unacceptable, and will be dealt with swiftly. Once, Mattei would have hesitated to use force to compel obedience, but things are different now, the Governor may not enjoy this part of the job, but it is his job all the same.\n\nThere's no going back now, nice words and sweet promises won't work anymore. Direct action will have to be done now. ENI Security, the Gulf Scouts, and any military police units that can be called upon quickly will descend like vultures upon Manama, Budaiya, and all the large population centers to suppress this disorder."
 
 gul_gunboat_diplomacy:0 "Gunboat Diplomacy"
 gul_gunboat_diplomacy_desc:0 "Governor Mattei prefers to reach agreements through mutually beneficial deals and transactions as a matter of principle. However, when the individuals he wishes to deal with, like some certain emirs that could be named, a more forceful approach may be required.\n\nMany of those in a position to prove bothersome in our future efforts have very fine homes. Homes on the waterfront as luck would have it. Perhaps they may see the error of challenging the Governorate if the Fourth Naval Division pays them a little visit. Admiral Oriana and the Governor may finally agree on something after all. We should not waste the opportunity to use Oriana while we can still count him loyal."

Unfortunately for us, it seems that this old adage has held true in regards to our suppression of agitators within the Governorate unhappy with our latest change in policy. No sooner have we put down the nuisance in Bahrain then trouble arises in the Qatar peninsula.\n\nIt is maddening for a man in Mattei's position, to be working so hard to improve the lives of everyone in the Gulf, and to be rewarded with such resistance. It cannot be helped apparently. Mattei must simply sigh wearily as he signs the orders for his security forces to arrest demonstrators, and find out who might use their influence to raise trouble and make sure they know not to involve themselves in matters above their level."

Luckily for us, we had the backing of Mother Italia and the Chairman's leadership to guide us, but those who have come here to earn their living on our rigs and in our refineries, they have no such support.\n\nAs it may be, it is clear that our new brothers need a helping hand. However, as some of our more conservative friends have pointed out, such programs do indeed cost substantial capital. The thought has occurred to the Chairman that maybe our hardworking new workers could use financial benefits more than those unreliable emirs..."

While some will view this as a step too far even for ENI, sometimes for the prosperity of the whole some feathers have to be ruffled.

He walked with a confidence that came not from physical power, but from the self-confidence of being Midas-touched and knowing it. The government of Rome understood fully who they were sending to take control of their most lucrative colony, and if they wanted their investment returned it would be ten fold if Mattei had anything to say about it.\n\nFrom the main building of the government complex came three individuals, one bearing the insignia of Admiral of the Regia Marina, the second, an Arab, with the robes and noble bearing of an Emir, and the last being a woman, Mattei's personal secretary who had gone ahead of him. He greeted them each in turn, and then with his small entourage in tow, entered his new home for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs they walked through the spacious and lavishly decorated rooms, the Emir, Zayed, spoke up, "Governor Matte, I hope the decorations are to your liking? We worked in tandem with your staff to prepare a place of work and of living that would make you feel welcome and at home."\n\nMattei smiled warmly at the prince, "My friend, and I hope we will be friends, you have been too kind. I can only hope our cooperation will always be as smooth and beneficial to the both of our peoples as this first act of generosity has been."\n\nZayed bowed his head respectfully, and then assuming an air of formal courtesy requested to be given leave to return to his brother, Emir Shakbut to inform him of the governor's safe arrival.

 GUL.2.t:0 "The Dubai Project"
 GUL.2.d:0 "From the balcony of the governor's mansion Enrico Mattei took another sip of the almost blood-hued red wine in his glass. The glass had been made in 1898 in Vienna; the wine in Romagna, 1905. Both were part of his private collection, carefully transported to the Gulf with great care by no less than six private planes. It was not the glass that could have stood proudly in any Italian museum or the wine that no doubt cost more than some small houses back home that currently captured the attention of this man, the newly minted governor of the Empire's Gulf possessions however, but the city from which he would oversee his charge. Dubai, the shining jewel of the Imperial colonial holdings that was quickly becoming the new Timbuktu of its age. When he had been appointed as Governor, it was implicitly understood that he was expected to bring his substantial experience in fortune building to this diamond in the sands.\n\nYears before he had ever stepped foot in the place, Rome had naturally set its eyes on the potential that could be harvested from the city, and the Dubai Project had been initiated with a good deal of capital being forwarded by Mattei himself and ENI. More pressing recent events had somewhat slowed the project down, it was true, but as he looked out into the city, he felt confident in his ability to not only bring the development back up to speed, but to improve efficiency and profits as he always had been able to. With Italy's victory against Turkey perhaps funding would even be increased, but regardless of that decision Mattei felt the confidence of a man in his twenties.\n\nOnly a few blocks from where he currently stood overlooking the city blanketed in night, the skeletal frames of skyscrapers were beginning to take shape like metal Towers of Babylon destined to reach the very ceiling of the world. Only this time God would not strike the humans down, for no God Mattei could imagine would oppose such growth. Further back were the offices at the outskirts of the city where the new districts were being drawn up and logistics were crunched by Italian clerks. The wine tasted good, Mattei thought as he placed the finished glass down on a nearby table, but the future, now that would be delicious to behold."

The report itself seems to sidestep the cause of this drop, would you please enlighten me Frederico?"\n\nThe aide gulped nervously, not wanting to run afoul of one of the Empire's most powerful men, "Well Mr. Chairman, sir, we are still in the middle of an exhaustive survey to root out all issues but preliminary reports... well, they suggest that the emirs have been a bit lax in their cooperation lately, and we think it might be driving down efficiency."\n\nThe emirs, Mattei reflected inwardly, they had been quite restless recently, and that was in spite of all that he had done in an attempt to earn their cooperation. Gifts, generous agreements, even the occasional overlook of impropriety, none of it seemed to be having an impact on their behavior. If this kept up for any longer...\n\n"Frederico", Mattei fixed his aide with a stare that was more severe than any the young man had ever seen his boss wear in all his years at ENI, "Call the regional ENI administrators.

The table was round, a deliberate choice to avoid any sense of favoritism or superiority amongst the guests, each of them would have to cooperate more or less for this project to work after all.\n\nMattei eyed Emir Shakbut of Abu Dhabi, perhaps the most powerful of the seven emirs in the room. He had proven difficult to convince to attend this meeting and was generally unhelpful in dealings with either the Empire or ENI. His brother Zayed, who flanked the emir silently like a shadow, now he seemed to be far more amicable with Mattei and the Italians generally. Eventually, Mattei ruminated, he would have to deal with the pair in some fashion, but that was still in the uncertain future. He had to focus on the present, the first meeting of the Council of Emirs he had established to act as an advisory body to the office of the governor was about to convene. As far as Mattei was concerned, there was no harm in giving the local leaders more of a voice, even if some of his ministers, including Admiral Oriana disagreed.\n\nMattei scanned over his prepared opening statement one more time as the last of the emirs took their seats and adjusted themselves.

They had taken off from a company airport for VIPs a few miles from the city proper, a slightly paranoid practice to be sure, but one could never be hurt by taking an extra precaution or two. Of course, the Chairman of ENI reflected inwardly, it was not as if there was anyone left to be scared of. No, the time for trepidation and caution was truly over with the emirs having been scattered to the wind, civil unrest in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Emirates put down, and the ever-meddlesome Oriana's powerbase pacified.\n\nThings had never looked brighter for the Empire's profit margin in the Gulf, and that meant that once again Enrico Mattei had proven his worth to his country and the world. True, it was not exactly as peaceful a process as he might have hoped, but veteran businessman that he was, Mattei understood all too well that negotiations never go as smoothly as the negotiators would hope. And yet, despite his understanding of the cold realities of politics and government, and despite the sense of triumph he ought to have felt for all that he had accomplished, the aging magnate felt a gnawing, quiet sadness that made him doubt himself. He could not put his finger on why he felt so, but he did all the same.

Still, the secrecy of this meeting was paramount, and if the heavily bundled visitor was half as committed as Mattei believed him to be, then the inconvenience was a trivial one at worst. There are always costs to doing business he thought as he motioned the man to take a seat, and he was thankful that this time, at least, the costs hurt no one.\n\n"Would you mind if I took the liberty of drawing down the blinds?" The first words the man had said since his entrance. Paranoid, but not entirely unreasonable given the situation. Mattei nodded his assent. In a practiced manner the man strode from window to window, drawing down the heavy blinds and even taking the extra precaution of staying out to the side, so as to not be seen even in this action. Apparently reassured, he finally took his seat, and began to remove the many garments obscuring his identity.

That was hardly surprising, Mattei reflected, after all, he had helped create Zayed by disposing of his brother Shakbut, and now he was at Zayed's door. It would be only natural to be somewhat concerned.\n\n"I would hope, my friend," Mattei responded cooly, "that you have at least some trust in my good will, at least towards you, given recent cooperation." Mattei watched as Zayed processed this answer, and the subtle shift in his stance showed that the emir had indeed accepted it.\n\n"Very true, please forgive my suspiciousness."\n\n"Don't worry about it at all my good prince, after all you were correct in your assumption. I do in fact have something more important I wish to discuss with you. It concerns the future of this region and with your cooperation I believe we can achieve wonders."\n\nThe emir stared at Mattei with curious eyes, hungry to know more.

Neither man had said anything for quite some time, only watching from the great windows onto the approaching dusk and taking in the view of the Gulf's shoreline.\n\nIt was only a few years before that Mattei had come to this land of dunes, beaches, and oil to manage it in the name of the Italian Empire. Now he was once again the chairman of ENI, and would in fact be returning to Italy the next morning. Emir Zayed would lead the Gulf into the new era that was rapidly approaching, and Mattei felt confident that he would be up to the task. Over the long years of his life, Mattei had often had cause to wonder if he had done more harm than good with his oil empire. Whatever else had happened now though, he could at least hold in his heart the pride of leading a new country to freedom where it could be better for its people and for the Italian nation as an ally.\n\n"You know," Mattei said into the silence, "I have always tried to do the right thing. I wish I could claim to have always followed that rule but it would be a lie to do so. Still, I would very much like to be able to know, from you my friend, that I have done something truly worthy of my Lord Jesus Christ."\n\nZayed looked somewhat surprised at this request, but his face quickly turned to a smile as he looked into the earnest oil man's eyes."

In the darkness an example of what could be now shown as a bright light to all who hoped to see the dreams of conquered peoples fulfilled. Of course, some were less than enthused. The Greater German Reich and Japanese Empire, likely fearful of their own subjects being stirred to action heavily suppressed the news and in rare cases where they did publicly acknowledge it, were openly scornful.\n\nIn Italy however, the news was greeted with a good deal of positivity from most quarters, with both FD and DC hailing Mattei as a great statesman who secured the best deal possible for both the Gulf and the Motherland. BN's response was overall less than enthused but this was tempered by the feelings of some party leaders that this action would in the long run prevent a waste of resources in putting down uprisings and strife. Even former Duce Ciano was quoted in the papers expressing support for the newly created United Emirates and hoping for a "long lasting and fruitful friendship between the two nations and peoples."\n\nThe seeds for that friendship seem to have already been planted in fact, with many deals remaining in place to allow Italy access to the Gulf's resources while providing protection for the UAE against its neighbors. Pledging to repay the generosity shown to it by its former suzerain, the UAE has bestowed to former Governor and current ENI chairman Mattei its highest honors as the beginning of its show of gratitude.""

His face was tinged pink with suppressed rage and the veins on his bald head were quite visible.\n\nHe turned to the SIM officer who sat to his left, taking a moment to compose himself before speaking, "And so you still can't establish contact with ENI's gulf office?"\n\nThe spook looked nervous, his eyes darting around the room at the others waiting on the answer as if he expected one of them to come to his rescue. Finally, sensing the futility of the act, he turned to his Duce and with a professional yet uncertain voice responded, "No, Duce Scorza, contact has not been reestablished since its termination seven hours ago. Our last report was that Governor Mattei's plane had gone down, and that he was presumed dead. They were in chaos sir, and the small task force that was deployed to establish the situation informed us that a new authority, calling itself the National Union Committee is in control there now."\n\nIt was all Scorza could do to keep from slamming his fist into the table. Damn that bastard Mattei, if only he hadn't gone and flown in that rinky-dink little toy plane. A major colony had gone dark and might be forever lost due to one man's stupidity. If Mattei were here now, he mused to himself, he would be dead all over again."

Should they attempt to do so in the Gulf, they will know be faced with the steely gaze and iron resolve of\n\nRome expects results from their new man in the Gulf, and the Admiral is determined to deliver, regardless of his own personal misgivings about his new assignment.

It was heavily supported by both the ruling class of the Gulf, particularly the Emir of Abu Dhabi, and the ENI corporation. Unfortunately, it has proven to be a massive boondoggle that is horrendously over-budget and behind schedule. A spectacular failure to match its ambitions it would seem.\n\nGovernor Oriana is not the kind of man to sit idly by and watch such a wreck accumulate with graft and debt that falls onto the poor and the workers while those who caused the failure are never held accountable. The military has instilled in him the virtues of responsibility and frugality. He will soon send out a memo outlining the discontinuation of the project."

The forces of his Fourth Naval Division stand ready to defend the Gulf and can never have enough funding to support their task if Oriana is to be believed. Crew pay, refueling costs, repair expenses, etc, etc, all cost money that can now be reasonably spent.

He of course does have this in mind, and that means that sooner or later, he will have to handle these troublesome relics of a past time. While he is accustomed to firing a gun more than negotiating conditions, Oriana is willing to respect their status at least for the purpose of preventing civil unrest and native resentment. He has already scheduled meetings with the various emirs and sheiks in which he will establish his supreme authority, but will promise not to interfere much in their private affairs.

In his capacity as Admiral, Oriana often worked with and grew to greatly respect this renowned regiment that has served the Empire across the globe defending her colonies. For this reason, the Governor has formally requested that the Lagunari be transferred to his Fourth Naval Division within the Gulf to bolster its defensive capabilities against internal and external threats. The Lagunari's flexible tactical abilities provide the Gulf a new wild card to play against regional threats.

The Dubai Arsenal Project as the Governor has dubbed it will seek to create an impressive arms manufacturing and storage depot just outside the city limits to act as a new supply hub for the entire strategic region capable of reinforcing even troops as far south as Somalia in the event of a crisis or conflict. ENI and the emirs have issued predictable protests, claiming that the military is well stocked and these resources could be put to better use, but Oriana is as uninterested in their whining as always.

Native groups that wish to merge with the Commissariati are free to do so, but any groups that refuse and continue to carry out policing actions will be considered vigilante groups and will be dealt with harshly.

Whether this is through government positions, privileges, favors, even a few back-room deals, Oriana will bite his tongue and even embarrass himself in his attempt to keep his position unassailable from within.

In this case, the sacrifice that will have to be made are the privileges and possibly even the rights of those who refuse to see reason and support the Empire.

Being a man quite disinterested in economics in general, Oriana has so far focused on other projects, but he realizes he must at least outline his plan to increase economic prosperity for at least the sake of his superiors back home. He will of course support the growth of ENI and other Italian companies as required, but he will not only focus on them, but also on the growing military industry he has supported in the Gulf."

This gives them quite a bit of leverage in policy making, and right now they are asking the governor to increase immigration. The reason is obvious, they need more bodies to work their oil rigs, their company stores, the million little positions that need filling. The Governor, having little cause to oppose them in this, has agreed to allow an increase in immigration, especially from India, but he has not gone quite as far as they would have liked. Agreeing to all of ENI's demands would allow them to exploit the migrants who would be coming in, and Oriana considers himself a man of principle. He is the government, not ENI."

It was good that Oriana insisted upon Italian police structures being imported to the Gulf. It turns out the emirs won't be needed much in this case, and all the better in the Governor's opinion. Italian police have more than enough experience keeping things peaceful back home and they will no doubt prove their own worth here."

As of right now, the majority of the workers employed in this task are either professionals from Italy or natives from the Gulf while a sizable minority are migrant workers from abroad, usually India. The problem is that even the lowest paid among these still require some payment, especially thanks to ENI Chairman Mattei's increase in general wages. Eventually, our plans to increase production will be limited by our ability to pay, and we just can't afford a profit fall off. That is why we jumped at the new proposal by the Minister of Justice back in Rome. The creation of dedicated worker penal colonies out in the desert will provide us with a significant boost to our human resources while keeping expenses about the same."

While nominally a friend and acceptor of Italian hegemony, it is quite apparent to Governor Oriana that the oil rich kings to his west are not to be trusted under any circumstances. He is of the opinion that they would seize any opportunity presented to attempt to secure the hidden treasures of the Gulf for their own pockets. Never one to allow the enemy to catch him unawares, Oriana has made his hawkish stance clear with a new directive to increase border security and defenses. While it may ruffle some feathers in Riyadh, their squawking is meaningless to the stern admiral."

Thanks in large part to patronage of the incredibly wealthy ruling class of nobles and oil-rich businessmen, these cities have become tourist traps and a place for the world's wealthiest to wine and dine each other. Of course, there is an equally expanding underclass within these cities that is there to maintain this system, and we cannot ignore them either.

Our efforts must always be increasing, our tools ever improving if we wish to keep Italy as the world's fourth superpower. Buying off the rights to oil-rich patches of sand from their native owners is now a major function of the Governorate, with an entire division of staffers, clerks, and lawyers handling acquisition.

Soon enough, should things go to plan, we will be able to carry out our agenda without any need to consider the demands of these men but for now we do have to pay some attention.

After conferring with his advisors and ENI officials for some time, Oriana proposed a somewhat modified approach. While new districts would need to be planned and constructed, they will be built by migrants being paid good money, and will be built to match the average standard of living back home.

No, Governor Oriana has always been committed to providing just recompense for labor, including mandated fair pay and benefits standards, if only to prevent revolts by the masses.\n\nSo far pilot programs meant to test the efficiency of such a policy have produced excellent results where the loss of net income from increased payments is matched or exceeded by an increase in productivity."

The trade off however, is that now these same emirs are seeking to leverage our debt to them for their own benefit. We had already planned to offer them government stipends and legal immunity from most prosecution but they are planning to demand even more concessions! They now want our government to subsidize their travel and their retinues.

It has an especially strong presence in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the latter of which is a financial backer if our intelligence is correct.

While the old admiral has never cared for Shakbut in particular of all the emirs, the man's wealth and influence combined with his ties to the Saudis make him one to be wary of at all times. In this new climate where the emirs dominate the scene, indulging him seems to be Oriana's only possible option for the time being.

One good thing to come out of the recent unrest is that Rome has become quite keen to give Oriana whatever he needs to keep the oil flowing and their respect for him has only increased as he was able to handle the mobs. All he needs to do is ask and multiple divisions could be allocated to his domain."

This money will be earmarked for weapons purchases, the hiring of outside private military companies, maintenance of equipment, and all of the numerous items that go to create a functioning military force. A good deal of the cash would also be put towards the refurbishment of all ships that have been deployed to the region."

The old Roman strategy of "Divide and Conquer" has always served the Italian people well, and it will serve us well in our plan to control the Gulf without any interference from Medieval throwbacks who contribute nothing of value to the people, the state, or society. We will pray on their weaknesses, their vices, their scandals, anything that can be used against them will be used against them by our agents from the shadows."

The division of Imperial intelligence that was allocated to the Governorate is fairly small, but it is made up of capable and veteran agents. We will have to ask them to push themselves to their limits but it will all be for the security and safety of this most vital part of our nation.

They are thieves and petty tyrants who would take society back into the Dark Ages in an instant if they were given control. They are failures, and we have the proof we need to make the people understand. We need only point to their inaction during the riots to make the point.

We do know for certain that many of the emirs are in the pockets of the Saudi royals. They've probably been working to destabilize us this entire time and likely supported the riots that started our troubles. We can't let them get away with this any longer. We will, in the strongest terms possible within the bounds of diplomacy, condemn the Kingdom and warn them that further interference will result in the force of the Empire coming down upon them. We may not have permission from Rome to make such a declaration but they will surely agree with us when they learn."

We will use our capital, Dubai for this purpose.

Conspiring with the Saudis, failure to support the regime, the reasons are largely window dressing but the results are what count. Their mansions, their land, everything they can use to oppose us is fair game and ripe for the taking. If they cooperate we're willing to offer them some token compensation, but if not?

All we need to think about now is fulfilling the needs of the empire. Governor Oriana may not have wanted the position, but it seems he has even exceeded the expectations of the men in Rome. A toast to our continued success in the Gulf!"
 
 ### Events Oriana ###
 
 GUL.21.t:0 "The Reign of the Admiral"
 GUL.21.d:0 "Oriana almost fell back into his chair, the communique he had just read over flying from his open hand and drifting in the air for a moment before coming to rest on the floor of Oriana's cabin. His eyes darted across his desk to the flask he occasionally would take a pull or two from after a hard day's work. He emptied it with an almost ferocious intensity. The flask spent, it too was dropped to the floor alongside the message that had roused such a reaction from the normally taciturn admiral.\n\nHe felt sick to his stomach, and the world seemed to sway as if the ship was in the middle of a violent storm rather than at its moorings in port. He had never asked for it, never even expressed an interest in the role, and yet they had forced it upon him anyway. He briefly wondered how long they had been planning this move; his mind ranged from the end of the Italo-Turkish war all the way back to when he had been first assigned to the Guld. He tried to remember any clues within his memories but the combination of the alcohol and his own nerves made such thought almost impossible.\n\nApparently the noise of his collapse into the chair or the sound of his flask hitting the ground must have been heard because at that moment a junior officer entered the room, "Sir, are you all right sir?"\n\nWith weary eyes the admiral surveyed the young man, and with a voice that was almost a croak he blurted out:"
 GUL.21.a:0 ""Son, they've made me the goddamn governor!""
 
 GUL.22.t:0 "Stop the Dubai Project"
 GUL.22.d:0 "From the desk of Governor Oriana:\nAfter careful review of the umbrella development program dubbed "The Dubai Project", I have determined that the aforementioned program is a significant waste of valuable resources and has been managed poorly until this point. With these and other facts in mind I, in my position as newly made governor of the Gulf Governorate of the Italian Empire do hereby declare an end to the "Dubai Project".\n\nWhile this may cause disappointment amongst the general populace, the needs of the Empire must come first, although I do not wish to say that we have no obligation to the people of the Gulf. Henceforth, the resources that were allocated to this unfortunate boondoggle will be reappropriated and distributed to more efficient and important uses. These uses shall include but are not limited to greater fleet funding, the development of industry in the Governorate, and programs that will more directly help all of the Empire's citizens in the Gulf, not just a single tourist trap of a city.\n\nA wish for this act to be representative of how I plan to execute my role here as governor in that I will prioritize the citizens and the nation above all else. Those who have concerns over my decision can contact me through the appropriate channels but be warned, I have no obligation to act as you wish should I determine what you suggest is not in the interests of the two groups I serve.\n\nAdm. Giuseppe Oriana, Governor of the Gulf"
 GUL.22.a:0 "The money is better spend elsewhere."
 
 GUL.23.t:0 "The Carrot"
 GUL.23.d:0 ""I trust you have a good reason for requesting my presence in the midst of a riot?" Emir Shakbut's voice was as harsh as ever, but Oriana did his best to quell his distaste for the ruler of the largest of the Gulf emirates. He did have a point about the riots of course, but to Oriana, the man's presence would be required to help quell the anger that had caused them. For that reason and for no other, Oriana kept his cool.\n\n"I am sorry for any inconvenience that I may have caused your excellency, but, if I may be so bold, I wish to discuss with you my new plan for administering the Governorate." That at least got Shakbut's attention. Seeing that his bait had been taken, Oriana pressed it, "I think it is high time I involve you and your peers more in the running of the region. After all, you are the rightful magistrates of the land and the people, no?"\n\nFlattery was always a sure bet with the haughty emir of Abu Dhabi, and Oriana watched as the nobleman nodded his head slowly, processing the out of character request. After a few moments of silence, Shakbut took his seat, the beginning of a smile that Oriana did not at all like creeping onto his face.\n\nOriana knew that he was doing what had to be done to exact his duty as leader of the Governorate but his heart sank in his chest when Shakbut began to gleefully demand concessions from him in order to secure cooperation. Oriana could only sit silently, and wish that he had his flask on hand."
 GUL.23.a:0 "A foul taste lingers."
 
 GUL.24.t:0 "The Stick"
 GUL.24.d:0 "The security officer in charge of ENI's private forces within the city of Dubai entered into Governor Oriana's ad-hoc war room that had been established in the former admiral's office in the government building. He surveyed the scene that presented itself to him as the stench of perspiration and fear mingled together and entered his nostrils. Several of his fellow security officers were of course present, but they seemed to be dwarfed both figuratively and physically by the senior officers of Oriana's own Fourth Naval Division. While the company security forces stood with a meek deference the professional military men moved about planning and issuing commands with a disciplined stiffness that made the officer glad that they were in charge.\n\nA few aides, couriers, and communication officers rounded out the room's complement overseeing the riot control effort. Lately riots had been appearing with greater frequency and furor over reasons that ranged from ENI policies to the excesses of the ruling emirs. The security officer himself had been on hand for at least half a dozen of them that he could call to mind.\n\nFor a moment, he thought that the Governor was not present, and turned to go find the man, but it was then that he noticed that he had been in the room the whole time, slumped deep into his chair, eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep no doubt. Despite the signs of mental and physical fatigue, the old soldier was in the middle of an animated discussion.\n\n"This is the last time I will allow the emirs to disappoint the Empire, do you understand me? Not only have they played a part in the cause of these riots but their token efforts and putting them down have proven pathetic at best! From now on, it will be the policy of the governorate to limit their power whenever possible. Now leave me, I have a headache coming on...""
 GUL.24.a:0 "Perhaps the officer's business can wait a while?"
 
 GUL.25.t:0 "Riots"
 GUL.25.d:0 "Gurudas Dasgupta found himself in an almost dreamlike state as he entered his home in the migrant quarter of Dubai. The exhaustion that gripped him was such that he found himself falling right into his bed with his work clothes still on. It was hard to believe that only a few minutes earlier he had spoken to a crowd of thousands as a riot burned around them. He hadn't intended to do anything of the sort when he joined a mostly-peaceful demonstration along with many of his fellow Indian migrant workers. True, he had developed an interest in politics back home but he had to work for a living, and politics sure wouldn't put food on the table, so he had made the decision to travel to the job-saturated Governorate of the Gulf.\n\nStill, when one of his coworkers asked if anyone had any words for the crowd, Dasgupta, quite to his own surprise, found himself mustering his courage and energy. The speech he delivered wasn't particularly novel, and in fact most of it had been cribbed from the various sociliast theorists he had been reading in his downtime, but it proved to be a pleaser nonetheless. The idea of a worker-run state proved to be, unsurprisingly in hindsight, appealing to the mostly Arab and Indian workforce that made up the group.\n\nHe had never seen himself as any type of leader, political or otherwise, despite his interests before tonight, but now? Well, if he could do something to help his fellow brothers and sisters struggling to survive in this harsh land of sand, perhaps that wouldn't be such a bad thing."

 GUL.26.t:0 "Peace At Last"
 GUL.26.d:0 "The figure of Faisal of Saudi Arabia stood before Emir Shakbut of Abu Dhabi. This meeting was a secret one, not that the governor could have stopped it, but still, Shakbut was the kind of man to play his cards cautiously, and he had no desire to reveal his plans before he was ready. Soon enough though, this modest level of intrigue would be completely unnecessary. He would be dominant, and the Italians would be gone from his home.\n\nFaisal's voice brought him out of his thoughts and into the real world once more.\n\n"You were saying you were nearly ready? I can begin supplying the weapons and equipment now if you're sure."\n\nShakbut nodded, he was sure, and having them a little early would be better than having them late. The Governor could be fed a yarn about them being for the emir's personal security force. Shakbut doubted that Oriana would even bother to check the story, the man was quickly becoming a drunken mess.\n\n"Please, make it so. I estimate that only a week more will be needed until I am able to fully commit my resources. You know, I really cannot thank you enough for all your assistance in this delicate matter."\n\nFaisal smiled mischievously, "Please, the pleasure is all mine...""

 GUL.27.t:0 "The Gulf becomes independent"
 GUL.27.d:0 "BREAKING NEWS The Gulf States Declare Independence From The Empire!\n\nTroubling news from the Gulf! When the Italian Empire dispatched seasoned admiral Giuseppe Oriana to act as Governor over its most profitable colony, experts had predicted that his term would be marked with a strengthening of state authority over the region and a possible increase in tensions with the Saudi Kingdom, which also has its eyes on the oil-saturated coast. While that prophecy proved true for a time, recent developments suggest that Admiral Oriana was perhaps not as ideal a choice as first appeared.\n\nOur sources have told us that the Ministry of Imperial Possessions was first alerted to the situation occurring in the Gulf when it was too late to act. By that time, we are told, Governor Oriana had already been forced to abandon the colony with all of his forces in tow. While there has been no violence reported it was clear that our forces were threatened with attack had they remained in the region.\n\nAt this time we are told that the government is closely monitoring the developing situation and is also keeping a close eye on the Saudi response."
 GUL.27.a:0 "But our Oil..."
 
 GUL.28.t:0 "Order Restored"
 GUL.28.d:0 "For the first time in a long time, Giuseppe Oriana smiled. His long-standing project to rebuild the Gulf for the better was seemingly complete at long last. A modern and model colony now, the admiral felt pride in knowing that he had played the chief part in brining this troubled Imperial territory into service for the greater good of all of the Empire's citizens and the state itself. It hadn't been a smooth journey of course, the entrenched powers in the Gulf, the emirs and ENI alike had been troublesome but by elevating the people and the ever-loyal Italian military to more prominent positions of power, he could curb and then crush the outdated noble authority the emirs still clung to.\n\nThat was all in the past however, and as good as it was to remember the success he had found, Oriana understood that looking ever forward was the best way to prevent stagnation and rot. He would not become complacent, he thought to himself as he enjoyed a small tug from his flask. Even now, there were those who could still prove a threat to Italian control in the Gulf, both within and without. He would never permit agitators or the likes of the Saudis to steal all that he had helped build personally. The flask empty, he tossed it off the balcony and into the water."
 GUL.28.a:0 "Peaceful Times Ahead"
 
 GUL.29.t:0 "Indian Migrants Rise Up"
 GUL.29.d:0 "By the time Governor Oriana realized the danger of the unfolding situation, it was far too late to avert the consequences. He had been led to believe that it was merely a few scattered demonstrations by laborers, most of whom worked for ENI's Gulf operations and were largely either native Arabs or Indians who had come to seek good-paying jobs. The admiral-turned-governor assumed that the local state peace officers would be able to put down the protests, after all, they seemed to be far smaller in scope than previous riots. So Oriana waited, expecting reports of successful operations in all areas. Instead, he was told that the rioters had swelled in massive numbers, almost half of the population by some estimates, and had taken over multiple cities.\n\nOriana was never able to understand, at least in the short time he had left as governor, the reason behind the uprising. Hadn't he done his best to provide for the people of the Gulf, Italian, Arab, and Indian alike? Hadn't he broken the power of the autocratic and arbitrary emirs? Hadn't he reestablished law and order during the previous riots? He had done all of this in fact, but he had not realized the full implications of his actions. Through his welfare programs, he had taught the people of the Gulf to understand the benefits of state support; through his destruction of the emirs, he had taught the people that autocrats could be toppled; through his repression of dissent, he had marked himself an enemy of those in the Gulf eager for self-determination and freedom.\n\nThe apparent leader of the uprising, Gurudas Dashgupta, had not proclaimed himself as such, but through his own charisma and skill and organization and management had made himself the man for the job. He announced an end to the Governorate of the Gulf as Oriana's Fourth Naval Division evacuated from the port at Dubai, declaring that the new worker's state of the Gulf would stand as a beacon of decolonization and the spirit of the Revolution."

 GUL.30.d:0 "Carlo Scorza's face altered between masks of confusion and frustration as he parsed through various reports and reconnaissance images.\n\n"So you're sure it was a communist uprising?" He looked up and into the eyes of the SIM officer who had delivered this latest batch of information.\n\n"Yes sir. Our last report from Governor Oriana indicated communist agitations were in progress, and the aerial photos bear that out." He gestured to one of the images, "If you look closely you can see the red flags that we believe to be communist in origin that have draped across the governor's headquarters."\n\nScorza stared intently at the somewhat blurry objects that were suspected of being icons of the red insurrection in the Gulf. Without even looking up, Scorza spoke to the intel man, "Any word from Oriana since the last time I asked?"\n\nA shake to indicate the answer, "I'm sorry my Duce, but all that we know is that most of the Fourth Naval Division was able to pull out of the Gulf, we believe the Admiral has simply gone silent until he enters into our territory once again."\n\nScorza sighed and, with a wave of his hand, dismissed the other man. He needed some time to himself, to sit in peace, and to think."
 GUL.30.a:0 "What a headache."

 GUL.31.t:0 "The Gulf joins the Arab League"
 GUL.32.d:0 "Shakbut had expected opulence of course, after all, nothing less would be worthy of a meeting between two such men of prestige and power. He had not, however, anticipated the lengths to which King Suad would go to demonstrate his wealth in the cementation of this alliance. Not that this was a bad thing in the mind of Emir Shakhbut, newly made leader of the now independent Gulf states. He was quite pleased in fact, as to him, the extreme decadence was a sign of the Saudi's desire to gain the Gulf on their side. Of course thought the emir, he needed the Saudis as much if not more than they needed him. Weakened as they may have been in recent years, the Italian Empire was nothing to scoff at, and that meant the Gulf would need a new patron in order to survive.\n\nAs if summoned by the thought, there stood King Suad bin Abdulraziz al Suad himself in all his kingly majesty, with a robe that must have been worth more than a small house at least by the estimation of Shakbut.\n\n"Welcome my honored guest, I hope the journey treated you well? Good, good... Please my dear friend make yourself at home for a few hours until the official ceremony and then you will be free to stay here for as long as you see fit."\n\nShakbut thanked his host and made the surprising long trip to his suite, all while visions of his future prosperity danced in his mind's eye, so close, and yet just out of reach. For the moment anyways, but as Shakbut reminded himself, nothing in the world was permanent save for Allah."
 GUL.32.a:0 "Arabs must stick together in these hard times."

 GUL.32.t:0 "The Gulf joins us!"
 GUL.32.d:0 "The Saudi government had long eyed its oil-rich neighbor of the Gulf States with hungry eyes. However, as long as it remained a colony of the Italian Empire, a nominal friend of the Kingdom of the House of Saud, King Abdulraziz could do nothing but bide his time. Or could he? From his court in Riyadh the lord of the wandering desserts and keeper of the Holy Cities plotted how he could best achieve his dreams of an Arab world under one banner, his banner. When Admiral Giuseppe Oriana, a known hawk, was given governorship, the king feared that his wait would never end, but it turned out that the old warrior would deliver the Gulf directly into Saudi hands.\n\nWhen riots erupted in multiple cities across the Gulf, Saudi money was discretely laundered to support them, when Emir Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi was given greater responsibility in the running of the colony, the flattery was non-ceasing, and when at last the Emirs pushed off the Italian yoke, it was the Kingdom that moved to guarantee their independence. The long chess game for control of the Gulf had finally come to a close, and King Abdulraziz was the victor. He did not waste the opportunity, and within weeks of the Gulf's independence, he had enticed Shakbut to enter into the Arab League that would be the vehicle for Saudi hegemony over the Arab world."
